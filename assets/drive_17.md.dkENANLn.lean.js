He was born in Rimini, the son of Count Lorenzo Garampi, a patrician of the city of Rimini. As a youth he studied in Rimini under the preceptorship of the naturalist Janus Plancus (Giovanni Bianchi). When Rimini was invaded by foreign armies, however, he went to Florence, where he became a follower of Johannes Lamius. He then went to Modena, where he became acquainted with Ludovico Antonio Muratori, the antiquarian and historian. He returned to Rimini, in 1741, where he continued his antiquarian and historical researches, working in the Biblioteca Gambalunga. In 1745 he became a member of the Accademia dei Lincei, whose branch at Rimini had been refounded by Janus Plancus.Marina Caffiero, \\"Garampi, Giuseppe,\\" Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani Volume 52 (1999); retrieved: 13 May 2019}}. Garampi turned to an ecclesiastical career, taking minor Holy Orders in Rimini in 1746. He then decided to seek a wider and more remunerative field for his talents in Rome.Girolamo Amati, \\"De vita Josephi Garampii Cardinalis Commentarius\\", in: In September 1747, he was ordained a Subdeacon, and then a Deacon, and on 31 March 1749 he was ordained a priest., p. 121, note 2. In 1749, at the age of twenty-four, he published in Rome a numismatic and historical treatise on Pope Benedict III (855–858), which drew him to the attention of the scholarly community attached to the papal court, including Pope Benedict XIV himself. He served as Prefect of the Archives from 1751 until 1772, during which time he compiled the Schedario Garampi, a massive card index for the Vatican Secret Archives. Although never completed, it is still in use. A few weeks after his appointment as Archivist, on 20 October 1752, Garampi was appointed a Canon of the Vatican Basilica by Pope Benedict XIV.Amati, p. 5. On 16 January 1772, Garampi was granted the degree Doctor in utroque iure by Pope Clement XIV by means of an apostolic rescript. On 27 January 1772, Garampi was appointed titular Archbishop of Berytus (Beirut, Lebanon); he was consecrated on 9 February by Cardinal Lazzaro Pallavicini. On 20 March 1772, he was appointed papal Nuncio to the King of Poland, Stanisław August Poniatowski. He served as Nuncio until October 1775.Ritzler-Sefrin, p. 121 with note 2. He was appointed papal Nuncio in Vienna, from 16 March 1776 to 1785. On 20 May 1776, Pope Pius V transferred him from the titular diocese of Berytus to the diocese of Corneto e Montefiascone (1776–1792), allowing him to retain the title of archbishop.Ritzler-Sefrin, pp. 121 with note 2; 295 with note 5. Pope Pius VI named him a Cardinal in the consistory of 14 February 1785, and on 3 April 1786 appointed him to the Titular church of Ss. Giovanni e Paolo.Ritzler- Sefrin, pp. 34, 44 column 2. On 20 August 1790, Garampi was named protector of the German college in Rome.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 34 note 90. He died in Rome at the German College on 4 May 1792, and was buried temporarily in the church of S. Apollinare. On 16 November 1792, the remains were taken to Ss.

Furthermore, there are concrete steps that lead from the rear of Grosnez Castle to a small automated signal station; the station platform affords scenic views. Name The name comes from the old Norse words for \\"grey headland\\" - - an accurate description of the site when seen from the sea. In time the spelling evolved to resemble the French for big nose. A nearby headland to the west has a similar name, Rouge Nez.Rouge Nez History Sir John des Roches ordered the castle built around 1330, about the time of the start of the Hundred Years' War. The castle's purpose was to provide local farmers with a place of refugee from French attacks.King (1988), p.12.Dillon (2011), p.69. The walls are of local granite and are thickest on the landward side. The castle's position on a clifftop 200 ft (~ 60 m) above the sea means that the natural features of the site protect it on three sides. A ditch dug into the rock provides protection on the fourth side. The remains of ruined walls, mostly footings, are still present.http://www.theislandwiki.org/index.php/Grosnez_Castle A drawbridge and portcullis protected the gatehouse, which is the only substantial surviving remnant, and would have made it difficult to capture. There are traces of six simple buildings. The castle, though, had a number of weaknesses: *There were no sally ports for counter-attacks; *Most importantly, there was no water well inside the walls. Another view of the castle The French captured the castle in 1373 and 1381. The castle was probably last used militarily during the time of the French occupation of Jersey (1461–1468, when the French held the east of the island, but loyal Jersey folk held the western parishes). In 1483, after several years of petitioning King Edward IV, the Seigneur of St Ouen - recommended to the King's Grace by his father-in-law the governor, was granted a ″License to Crenelate″ - that is allowed to fortify his manor house. Governor Harliston approved the dismantling of the ″fort of refuge″ at Grosnez so that the already-worked stone could be re-used in fortifying St. Ouen's Manor. The financial savings were important to Seigneur De Carteret, as - when he came into his majority - ″trees grew in the Hall of the Manor because his Guardians had wasted the substance of the Rentes″ i.e. - embezzled the income - and he was investing heavily in renovating the dilapidated manor buildings. His shortage of money was both what influenced him to marry the daughter of the Plantagenet Governor Harliston, and also what led him into conflict with the second governor of the island after 1486. When Matthew Baker was sent to take Harliston's place in 1486, the Seigneur had not paid his taxes to the Exchequer for three years - since the death of Edward IV. De Carteret was already under some suspicion as a Plantagenet supporter - after all - the rebel Governor Harliston was his father-in-law. When King Henry VII ordered a general examination of outstanding accounts by the Exchequer clerks, it was inevitable that De Carteret would be required to pay the back taxes he owed the Crown. This, then, is the background to the dismantling of Grosnez Castle - and also of the later friction between De Carteret and Matthew Baker. In 1806, a naval signal station was established at Grosnez to send messages to Guernsey. Modern depiction Grosnez Castle appears on the reverse of the Jersey 50 pence coin.

Situated 1 km east of the Missaguash River which forms the inter- provincial boundary with New Brunswick, Fort Lawrence is situated on a low ridge facing Aulac to the west and Amherst to the east. Aside from the more prominent Aulac Ridge, the Fort Lawrence Ridge is surrounded by the flat plain of the Tantramar Marshes with a commanding view of the Cumberland Basin, an arm of the Bay of Fundy. History Referred by the Mi'kmaq as 'Kwesomalegek,' meaning \\"a hardwood point\\", the area of the Tantramar Marshes containing Fort Lawrence was settled in 1672 by Acadians who named it 'Beaubassin.' The area was also known as Missiquash or Missaguash, a Mi'kmaq name meaning \\"marsh river.\\" = Father Le Loutre's War = Charles Lawrence Following the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht which gave Britain control of Acadia, the boundaries between this territory and that of New France were unclear but a quasi boundary at Beaubassin was established. During Father Le Loutre's War Major Charles Lawrence constructed a log stockade installation that he named Fort Lawrence on the ridge in 1750 as part of a campaign by the British Army to reduce to obedience the Acadian settlers and Mi'kmaq in the district. In response, the French military constructed the more elaborate Fort Beauséjour on the Aulac Ridge, 1.5 km to the west. = French and Indian War = The Battle of Beausejour later took place between June 4-June 16, 1755 which saw the British forces from Fort Lawrence gain control of Fort Beauséjour as the opening salvo in the Seven Years' War that would result in continental dominance for Britain. Fort Lawrence soon fell into disrepair and nothing remained of the facility after several decades. The community and ridge it sits upon now bears the name he gave the fort. = Transportation = In 1872 the Intercolonial Railway of Canada was constructed south of the community, on the route between Truro and Moncton. The Chignecto Marine Transport Railway Company, Limited began construction of the Chignecto Ship Railway in the 1880s across the Isthmus of Chignecto with its western terminus in the Cumberland Basin immediately west of Fort Lawrence; the project ran into technical and financial problems and was abandoned in 1891 before it was fully opened. The original road through Fort Lawrence was called LaPlanche Street. In the 1960s, Highway 104, the Trans-Canada Highway, was constructed across the ridge immediately north of the site of the fort. It connected with Highway 2 in New Brunswick at the bridge over the Missaguash River. The Nova Scotia provincial government constructed a visitor information centre with a traffic circle which was famous in the summer months when a bag piper would serenade tourists. Subsequent highway upgrades saw a new 4-lane alignment built several dozen metres to the north. = Today = Today's community of Fort Lawrence consists of a handful of small mixed farms and residential homes, largely functioning as a suburb of Amherst. The original alignment of the 1960s-era Trans-Canada Highway has been redesignated Laplanche Street and is a local road connecting to the west end of Amherst. Several closed hotels and restaurants were once located along this once-busy strip but have since been demolished. A few businesses remain open mainly dedicated to agriculture & forestry equipment, metalworking, and automotive / motorcycle shops.

A plant pathogen, it is the causal agent of brown rot of stone fruits. Stone fruit (summer fruit) Stone fruits such as apricot and peaches originated in China and spread through old trade routes 3–4000 years ago. Nectarines are more recent (at least 2000 years). Cherries and European plums originated in Europe, although the Japanese plum originated in China.Whiting. J. R. (n.d.). Science behind your garden. Retrieved October 27, 2007, from http://www.gardenscience.co.nz Trees exposed to cold in autumn and early spring can develop cankers under the bark of the trunk or branches. Cankers are usually associated with the production of amber-coloured gum that contains bacteria and oozes on to the outer bark. Unfortunately, there are few control methods for fungal spores apart from copper sprays. Symptoms Brown rot causes blossom blight, twig blight; twig canker and fruit rot.Ministry of Agriculture. (2007. Brown rot of stone fruits. Retrieved October 27, 2007, from http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/cropprot/tfipm/brownrot.htm (dead link) Brown rot is caused by a fungus that produces spores, and can be a major problem during particularly wet seasons. Prolonged wet weather during bloom may result in extensive blossom infection. The length of wet periods required for blossom infection depends upon the temperature. Humid wet conditions are when the fruit trees are most at risk from infection. Young green fruit can be infected just before autumn, but the infection often remains inactive until near maturity of the fruit. Brown rot can spread after harvest. Mature fruit can decay in only 2 days under warm conditions. Blossom Blight: Infected blossoms wilt, shrivel and become covered with greyish mould. Petals may appear light brown or water-soaked. Blighted blossoms do not produce fruit. Dead blossoms may stick to spurs and twigs until harvest, providing a source of spores for the fruit rot phase. Twig Blight and Canker: On peaches and apricots the infection may spread to twigs, causing brownish, oval cankers that may girdle and kill twigs. Fruit rot Brown rot on apple Fruit rot appears as small, circular brown spots that increase rapidly in size causing the entire fruit to rot. Greyish spores appear in tufts on rotted areas.Fruit Facts at New Zealand Infected fruit eventually turn into shrivelled, black mummies that may drop or remain attached to the tree through the winter. Brown rot can be serious on injured fruit such as cherries split by rain. Life cycle Over-wintering: The fungus over-winters in mummified fruit on the ground or in the tree and in twig cankers. Spring Infection: two types of spores are produced in spring which can infect blossoms. Conidia are produced on cankers and fruit mummies on the tree. Apothecia (small mushroom-like structures) form on mummies lying on the ground. The apothecia discharge ascospores during the bloom period, but don’t contribute to fruit infection later in season. Secondary Infection: Spores produced on blighted blossoms provide a source of infection for ripening fruit. Infected fruit become covered with greyish spores which spread by wind and rain to healthy fruit. Insects may also contribute to the spread of brown rot spores. Plant defences A plant's first line of defence against infection is the physical barrier of the plant's “skin”, the epidermis of the primary plant body and the periderm of the secondary plant body. This first defence system, however, is not impenetrable. Viruses, bacteria, and the spores and hyphae of fungi can still enter the plant through injuries or through the natural openings in the epidermis, such as stomata. Once a pathogen invades, the plant mounts a chemical attack as a second line of defence that destroys the pathogens and prevents their spread from the site of infection. This second defence system is enhanced by the plant's inherited ability to recognise certain pathogens.Campbell, N.A. & Reece, J.B. (2005). Biology (7th ed). San Francisco: Benjamin Cummings. Elicitors: Oligosaccharins, derived from cellulose fragments released by cell wall damage, are one of the major classes of elicitors. Elicitors stimulate the production of antimicrobial compounds called phytoalexins. Infections also activate genes that produce PR proteins (pathogenesis-related proteins). Some of these proteins are antimicrobial, attacking molecules in the cell wall of a bacterium. Others may function as signals that spread “news” of the infection to nearby cells. Infection also stimulates the cross-linking of molecules in the cell wall and the deposition of lignin, responses that set up a local barricade that slows spread of the pathogen to other parts of the plant. Control Orchard sanitation, removing fruit mummies and pruning any cankered or dead twigs will reduce inoculum levels, which will improve the effectiveness of fungicide sprays. Primarily treatment is chemical; using fungicidal sprays to control the spread of the fungus. Spraying occurs during all phases, blossoms, green fruit, and mature fruit. Stone fruit trees' only natural defences are “skin” and chemical reactions to being attacked by the fungi, but this is a limited defence, so spraying and orchard sanitation are the best way to control spread of the fungus.

Function Generally, insuring entities may negotiate contracts with the healthcare provider, with a defined set of reimbursement values for the work performed by the provider. These rates may entail a significant discount from the amount the provider would charge an uninsured patient. For a given provider, the amount of discount varies between different insuring entities, and a separate contract is negotiated with each entity. Silent PPOs create agreements with insuring entities, allowing buyers into the Silent PPO to access the terms of the lowest discounted rate available. Patients (and other insuring entities who are members of the Silent PPO) may then access the lowest discounted rate of the healthcare provider, even though the patient is not directly a member of the plan contracted to the healthcare provider. The members of the Silent PPO might be insurance companies, self insured employer health plans or another Silent PPO. The Silent PPO could also be a middle man and resell their created network of healthcare providers. Criticism There are medical organizations which disagree with or dislike the concept of Silent PPOs.\\"Silent PPOs/Rental Networks\\", Texas Medical Association, retrieved 4/25/2008. The problem, as advocated, is that when the physician negotiated the discount, they intended to give it only in exchange for referrals from members of the insurer – where a patient is given some advance incentive to choose them. Silent PPOs typically do not make referrals, but provide access to the discount after the service was rendered. Additionally, providers argue that, had the patient not entered via a back-door arrangement, they would not have been given the discount applied to the contract. Thus, the provider loses money from the amount that would have been charged. Various companies specialize in auditing medical care contracts and target issues related to Silent PPOs.

He started the novel in about 1943 and worked on it intermittently for several years before putting it aside. For over 50 years Summer Crossing was thought to be lost but it was eventually rediscovered among Capote's papers and was published in 2005. The novel tells the story of a spoiled young socialite whose romantic dalliances grow increasingly serious after her parents leave her alone one summer while traveling. Conception and critical reception Capote started writing Summer Crossing in 1943 when he was working for The New Yorker. After taking an evening walk in Monroeville, Alabama, and being inspired to write his first published novel, Other Voices, Other Rooms, he set aside the manuscript . On August 30, 1949, while vacationing in North Africa, Capote informed his publisher that he was approximately two-thirds through his first draft of Summer Crossing. He optimistically spoke of finalizing the manuscript by the end of the year, even making a vow that he would not return to the United States until he did,Brinnin, John Malcolm.

Capote: a Biography (1998) Carroll & Graff. pp. 202 & 218 Capote had been making minor edits to the work over a period of approximately 10 years. Robert Linscott, Capote's senior editor at Random House, was unimpressed with the first draft. He said he thought it was a good novel, but that it didn't showcase Capote's \\"distinctive artistic voice.\\"Clarke, Gerald. Capote: a Biography (1998) Carroll & Graff. p. 218 After reading the draft over several times, Capote noted that the novel was \\"well written and its got a lot of style\\", but that he just didn't like it. In particular Capote began \\"to fear [the novel] was thin, clever, unfelt.\\"Berendt, John. \\"Introduction\\" in Truman Capote, Other Voices, Other Rooms (2004/1948) Random House. p. xi. Later Capote claimed to have destroyed the unpolished manuscript, along with several other notebooks of prose, as a part of this fit of harsh self-criticism.Clarke, Gerald. Capote: a Biography (1998) Carroll & Graff. p. 218  Manuscript recovery  A number of writings including the manuscript to Summer Crossing had been rescued from the trash by the house sitter of an apartment in Brooklyn Heights, where Capote lived around 1950. Upon the death of the house sitter, his nephew discovered Capote's papers and sent them to Sotheby's for auction in 2004. The papers failed to sell at auction because of the high price and because the physical papers did not confer publication rights to the work, which were held by the Truman Capote Literary Trust. Subsequently, the New York Public Library reached an agreement to buy the papers and archived them in its permanent Truman Capote Collection. After a consultation with Capote's lawyer, Summer Crossing was published in 2005. The first edition was set from Capote's original manuscript, which was written in four school notebooks and 62 supplemental notes, with an afterword by Alan U. Schwartz, Capote's executor.Schwartz, Alan U. \\"Afterword\\" in Truman Capote, Summer Crossing (2006/2005) Random House. pp. 132-138. An excerpt of the story was also published in the October 24, 2005, issue of The New Yorker. Plot summary The story takes place in New York City over the course of the hot summer of 1945. Grady McNeil, a 17-year-old upper class Protestant débutante, steadfastly refuses to accompany her parents on their usual summer ritual of travel, in this case to France. Left in the city for the summer by herself, she pursues a covert romance with Clyde Manzer, a Jewish parking lot attendant, whom she had noticed several months earlier. Grady spends time with Clyde and meets some of his friends, and in turn the couple visits the Central Park Zoo together. There, Clyde mentions his brother's bar mitzvah as a way of introducing the fact that he is Jewish. As the summer heats up, so does Grady's and Clyde's romance. The couple is soon wed in Red Bank, New Jersey. Once married, Grady meets Clyde's middle-class family in Brooklyn, and only then is the couple truly faced with the stark reality of the cultural divide between her family and his. Grady then realizes at her sister Apple's home that she is six weeks pregnant. Grady has passed over a couple of opportunities to spend time with the handsome young Peter Bell, a man of her social stature who is romantically interested in her. Eventually Grady's sister, Apple, confronts her about her relationship with Clyde. In an abrupt ending, Grady aims her speeding Buick with passengers Peter, Clyde, and Clyde's friend Gump so it will crash off the Queensboro Bridge, killing everyone.

She was the wife of the J2M terrorist Norbert Kröcher. Her nom de guerre was \\"Nada\\".http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14023524.html Biography =Early life= Kröcher-Tiedemann was born in Ziegendorf in Mecklenburg, Germany on 18 May 1951. She studied at a grammar school in Bielefeld before moving to Berlin to study politics and sociology. At that time she was associated with communist communes in Berlin. =Crimes= It is not clear at what point Kröcher-Tiedemann went underground, but in 1973 she shot a policeman in a Buchen carpark after he tried to arrest her for stealing number plates. She was subsequently arrested and was sentenced to eight years in prison. However, as a result of the Peter Lorenz kidnapping prisoner exchange, she was freed two years later in 1975 and flown to South Yemen. OPEC siege On 21 December 1975 she participated with the international terrorist \\"Carlos the Jackal\\" in a raid on the OPEC headquarters in Vienna. There she murdered two people: one was a 76 year old policeman interpreter named Anton Tichler and the other was a plainclothes Iraqi bodyguard who had grabbed hold of Kröcher-Tiedemann. While he was attempting to control her weapon, Kröcher- Tiedemann produced a second gun and shot the man through the head. The raid was successful and, on 22 December, 42 hostages as well as the hostage takers were flown to Algiers, then Tripoli and then Algiers again. All the hostages were freed and the terrorists were all given asylum. Walter Palmers In November 1977, Kröcher-Tiedemann working again with J2M, kidnapped an Austrian millionaire named Walter Palmers, and successfully managed to obtain a $2 million ransom in exchange for his freedom. =Capture, imprisonment and death= Kröcher-Tiedemann showed up again in December 1977 when she shot two Swiss customs men after they attempted to arrest her at Porrentruy, near the Swiss border. Both survived, although one would remain paralysed for life. She was subsequently arrested and when her baggage was searched, weapons, forged I.D. papers, blueprints of the Israeli embassy in Berlin and $20,000 (of Palmer's ransom money) were found. Kröcher-Tiedemann spent the next 10 years in a Swiss prison, and in 1987 she was extradited back to Germany, where she was charged with her part in the OPEC raid. However, due to lack of evidence she was acquitted in May 1990. Suffering from ill health, Kröcher-Tiedemann was released from prison in 1991. She was operated on five times in 1992 and on 7 October 1995 she finally succumbed to cancer at the age of 44.(dead link) In popular culture Kröcher-Tiedemann was portrayed by Julia Hummer in the 2010 French television miniseries Carlos.

It was produced and directed by Cecil B. DeMille from a screenplay by Harold Lamb, Edwin Justus Mayer and C. Gardner Sullivan adapted by Jeanie Macpherson from the novel Lafitte the Pirate by Lyle Saxon. The music score was by George Antheil and the cinematography by Victor Milner. The film stars Fredric March as Lafitte, Franciska Gaal and Akim Tamiroff with Margot Grahame, Walter Brennan, Ian Keith, Spring Byington, Douglass Dumbrille, Beulah Bondi and Anthony Quinn in supporting roles. It is one of the few pre-1950 sound films by Paramount to remain under that studio's ownership (partly so the remake could be filmed), whereas most films from that era had been sold to EMKA, Ltd. – now part of NBCUniversal Television Distribution – in the early television era. Cecil B. DeMille remade the film in 1958 in Technicolor and VistaVision with the same title, but because of ill health, he allowed Henry Wilcoxon, his longtime friend and associate, to produce it, and the film was directed by Anthony Quinn, who was his son-in-law at the time. DeMille received no screen credit, but did make a personal appearance in the prologue to the film, much as he did in The Ten Commandments. The 1958 version of The Buccaneer stars Yul Brynner, Charles Boyer and Claire Bloom, with Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson. Douglass Dumbrille appeared in both versions and Quinn acted in the earlier version. Plot In the closing stages of the War of 1812, Dolly Madison (Spring Byington) evacuates the White House as the British Army arrives and burn Washington. Laffite (Fredric March) asks a young woman of good family, Annette de Remy (Margot Grahame), to marry him but she asks him to give up his piracy first. He and his pirates set up a trading post in Louisiana in the swamp to sell luxury goods to New Orleans society that they have seized from foreign ships but have to suspend their sales when the governor, Ferdinand Claiborne, who has put a bounty on his head, appears with troops. Senator Crawford (Ian Keith) tells him that the British will offer him money to help them. Laffite leaves for the sea where he finds one of his captains, Captain Brown (Robert Barrat) has seized the Corinthian, an American ship, contrary to his orders not to attack American ships, burning the ship and killing the crew and passengers. Laffite's man Dominique You (Akim Tamiroff) saves the sole survivor Gretchen (Franciska Gaal), who had been made to walk the plank by Brown so no witnesses remained, and Lafitte hangs the captain for disobeying orders. Lafitte spares Gretchen despite her potential as a hostile witness and Gretchen works as his maid and falls in love with him, despite You being in love with her. The British, who are planning to attack New Orleans, offer Laffitte position and wealth if he will guide them through the swamps to the city and threaten to attack his stronghold if he will not. Although his men are willing, Lafitte's loyalty is to Louisiana and he delays answering the British, instead warning the city authorities of the British plans. On Crawford's advice, Brevet Major General Andrew Jackson (Hugh Sothern), who leads the available American forces, does not trust Lafitte and instead attacks his stronghold in order to prevent him aiding the English, capturing or killing his men, whom Lafitte has ordered not to resist. Meanwhile, Jackson determines to defend the city, though he has limited forces, despite Crawford's advice to surrender the city. Lafitte, who escaped from the attack, perseveres, appearing before Jackson in person and offering to supply him with flints and powder and provide experienced gunners to help defend the city if he will pardon his men. Jackson agrees to grant pardon after the forthcoming battle, although he will only promise to give Lafitte an hour's start from pursuit. Lafitte releases his men, in the process killing Crawford in a sword fight. The entrenched American forces, with the help of Lafitte's artillery and gunners, mow down the advancing ranks of disciplined but over confident British troops. At the victory ball, Gretchen is recognized as a passenger on the Corinthian and as wearing clothing and jewels from Annette's sister, who was a passenger on the ship. It is consequently revealed that Lafitte's men had sunk it, killing Annette's sister along with the other passengers and crew. Lafitte accepts ultimate responsibility for the tragedy and is only saved from a lynching by Jackson, who keeps his promise of giving Lafitte an hour's start. With Annette heartbroken, Lafitte leaves, reaching his ship safely, where he finds that Gretchen has stowed away.

The junction is situated about east of Sheffield Victoria and is controlled from a portable signal cabin on the ‘down’ (Sheffield bound) side of the line below where the line is crossed by a road bridge, which carries Woodbourn Road (Note the difference in spelling). From the beginning The first junction at this point was built when the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, having taken over the South Yorkshire Railway, constructed a line to Rotherham, opening on 1 August 1864. Traffic from the South Yorkshire Railway's Barnsley line joined the Rotherham line at Tinsley South Junction and both services entered Sheffield Victoria through this junction. The L.N.W.R. came to Sheffield in 1895 when they opened a goods depot, known as City Goods, in the Nunnery area. The line which left the M.S.& L. went around the rear of the signal box, which controlled its junction. New lines In the 1940s, with the opening of Darnall engine shed a new junction, controlled by the Woodburn Junction signalman, gave access, by a flyover junction from the up goods line and egress to the down goods line. In the 1960s, with the opening of the new Wholesale Markets a short spur, known as the Parkway Goods branch, was opened, again controlled from Woodburn Junction box. Rationalisation From November 1991 the layout was reduced in keeping with the requirements of traffic, the Rotherham/Tinsley Yard line being reduced to single track. In 1992 both Shepcote Lane and Tinsley East Junction signal boxes were closed and the controlling panel installed in Woodburn Junction box, still, at that time, the old brick based, wooden box of Great Central vintage.

Indeed, this was the only first-team appearance he made for Yorkshire, and after a year out the following season he moved to Worcestershire for 1953. Ashman came straight into the first team at New Road for the tour match against the Australians in late April. Although he took no wickets in a high-scoring draw, he was retained for the County Championship match against Somerset which followed. In this he returned an excellent match analysis of 36-24-36-5, and this set him up well to keep his place for the season. In all he took 41 first-class wickets at an average of 43.85, with a best return of 5-40 against Glamorgan in mid-May; Worcestershire lost this game by a single run. In 1954, Ashman played ten further games for the county, mostly in the middle of the season, but he did not have as much success as he had the previous year. He did record a career-best 7 for 111 against Oxford University, and 3 for 80 against their Cambridge counterparts, but these two performances aside he could not manage more than a single wicket in an innings. The disastrous game against Surrey at The Oval in late August, when Worcestershire were humiliatingly dismissed for 25 and 40, proved to be his last in first-class cricket (Ashman took the single wicket of Bernie Constable), although he did turn out a couple of times for the Second XI in 1955. Ashman died in Southbourne, West Sussex in March 2019 at the age of 92.John Ashman obituaryAncestry LifeStory: John Robert Ashman References External links * Category:1926 births Category:2019 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:Cricketers from Rotherham Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Yorkshire cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1946 to 1968 ","title":"John Ashman"},{"id":"9501027","text":"Skull of a horse sacrificed by multiple sword blows during the Iron Age (4-500 AD), found in Nydam Engmose, Denmark, at the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen Many Indo-European religious branches show evidence for horse sacrifice, and comparative mythology suggests that they derive from a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) ritual. Context Horses are often sacrificed in a funerary context, and interred with the deceased, a practice called horse burial. There is evidence but no explicit myths from the three branches of Indo-Europeans of a major horse sacrifice ritual based on a mythical union of Indo-European kingship and the horse.Mallory & Adams (2006:437). The Indian Aśvamedha is the clearest evidence preserved, but vestiges from Latin and Celtic traditions allow the reconstruction of a few common attributes. Some scholars, including Edgar Polomé, regard the reconstruction of a PIE ritual as unjustified due to the difference between the attested traditions.Dearborn (1997:278, article \\"Horse\\"). Etymology The Gaulish personal name Epomeduos is from ek'wo- medhu- (\\"horse + mead\\"), while aśvamedha is either from ek'wo-mad-dho- (\\"horse + drunk\\") or ek'wo-mey-dho- (\\"horse + strength\\"). Mythology Reconstruction of a sacrificed horse and two dogs (570-600 AD) from Povegliano Veronese The reconstructed myth involves the coupling of a king with a divine mare which produced the divine twins. A related myth is that of a hero magically twinned with a horse foaled at the time of his birth (for example Cuchulainn, Pryderi), suggested to be fundamentally the same myth as that of the divine twin horsemen by the mytheme of a \\"mare-suckled\\" hero from Greek and medieval Serbian evidence, or mythical horses with human traits (Xanthos), suggesting totemic identity of the Indo-European hero or king with the horse. Comparative rituals =Vedic (Indian)= Ashvamedha was a political ritual that was focused on the king's right to rule. Horse had to be a stallion and it would be permitted to wander for a year, accompanied by people of the king. If the horse roamed off into lands of an enemy then that territory would be taken by the king, and if the horse's attendants were killed in a fight by a challenger then the king would lose the right to rule. But if the horse stayed alive for a year then it was taken back to the king's court where it was bathed, consecrated with butter, decorated with golden ornaments and then sacrificed. After the completion of this ritual, the king would be considered as the undisputed ruler of the land which was covered by the horse. #the sacrifice is connected with the elevation or inauguration of a member of the Kshatriya warrior caste #the ceremony took place took place in spring or early summer #the horse sacrificed was a stallion which won a race at the right side of the chariotMallory, James P., and Douglas Q.

The major points of comparison involve: #The king (most likely; Geraldus is somewhat indirect) engages in sexual intercourse with the mare to be sacrificed; #The horse is dismembered and cooked in a cauldron, and consumed by the king who is also sitting in the cauldron. =Norse= The Norse ceremony according to the description in Hervarar saga of the Swedish inauguration of Blot-Sweyn, the last or next to last pagan Germanic king, c. 1080: #the horse is dismembered for eating #the blood is sprinkled on the sacred tree at Uppsala. The Völsa þáttr mentions a Norse pagan ritual involving veneration of the penis of a slaughtered stallion.DuBois (2006:76). A freshly cut horse head was also used in setting up a nithing pole for a Norse curse.Mallet (1847:155-157). Archaeology The primary archaeological context of horse sacrifice are burials, notably chariot burials, but graves with horse remains reach from the Eneolithic well into historical times. Herodotus describes the execution of horses at the burial of a Scythian king, and Iron Age kurgan graves known to contain horses number in the hundreds. There are also frequent deposition of horses in burials in Iron Age India. The custom is by no means restricted to Indo-European populations, but is continued by Turkic tribes.

He was editor of the Tribune newspaper from 1919 to 1972, and served in the Bahamian House of Assembly for 24 years. Dupuch was named as 'longest serving newspaper editor' by the Guinness Book of World Records. Early life He was born Alfred Etienne Jerome Dupuch to Leon and Harriet (née Saunders) Dupuch. Etienne's mother died in 1909 giving birth to a stillborn daughter. Etienne's father, Leon, founder of the Tribune newspaper, died five years later in 1914 when young Dupuch was 15 years old.  Political life  Dupuch served as a Member of Parliament in the Bahamian House of Assembly from 1925 to 1942 and from 1949 to 1956. In 1956, Dupuch, together with his younger brother Eugene, introduced the first comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in the colony's history, to outlaw racial discrimination in hotels, restaurants and other public places at a time when the country's tourist industry was experiencing dramatic growth. Dupuch was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and was later knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He also received a papal knighthood from Pope Pius XII (Order of St Gregory the Great). During his time in office he was opposed to the nascent Progressive Liberal Party believing that Bahamians should pursue a middle way to resolve the political differences that existed at the time between blacks and whites.  Newspaper career  Dupuch began his newspaper career as a boy by delivering The Tribune on roller-skates through Nassau's 'over the hill' ghetto areas. He took over the editorship after serving as a soldier in the British Army during the First World War. Dupuch kept faith with the slogan 'Being Bound to Swear to the Dogmas of No Master', used by his father Leon Dupuch when he launched The Tribune as a four-page newspaper in 1903. The slogan was originally used in The Bahamas by John Wells, a loyalist who started the first Bahamian newspaper, The Gazette.Genealogica And Heraldica, By Auguste Vachon, Claire Boudreau, Daniel Cogne His descendant Lisa Wells founded the first news website in The Bahamas, BahamasB2B.com, in 2000. For years, Dupuch was at odds with Nassau's ruling white élite, the Bay Street Boys, and was hostile to The Duke of Windsor during his five-year rule (1940-1945) as Governor of the Bahamas during the Second World War. Dupuch was known for strong editorials on his political positions. While Dupuch served as editor, the newspaper published a 1959 book on the 1943 murder of Sir Harry Oakes, which was never solved, with the only trial case finding the defendant, Alfred de Marigny, not guilty.The Woman He Loved, by Ralph G. Martin, 1974, New York, Simon and Schuster Dupuch's powerful editorials were required reading among 'thinking Bahamians' for many decades. Most prominent Bahamian journalists learned their craft under his tutelage, including Sir Arthur Foulkes, the former Governor-General of the Bahamas. In the late 1960s, when he retired from the Senate, Dupuch was described by a fellow Senator, Doris Johnson, as 'a pesky pimple on the body politic of the Bahamas' – a quote he insisted on using in The Tribunes headline the following day. In 1972, aged 73, Dupuch handed control of The Tribune to his daughter Eileen, a qualified barrister and graduate of Columbia University's famous journalism school, who remains publisher to the present day. She is also head of a media empire that now includes radio stations. Among Dupuch's protégés, apart from Sir Arthur Foulkes, were Oswald Brown, who went on to become Managing Editor of both The Nassau Guardian and The Freeport News, and John Marquis, the award-winning British journalist who worked as a political reporter on both The Nassau Guardian and The Tribune in the 1960s, and returned to the Bahamas in 1999 as The Tribunes Managing Editor. During Marquis's ten years as Managing Editor, The Tribune enjoyed a dramatic surge in circulation. It also became embroiled in a string of controversies. Its exposure of a scandal involving the American cover girl Anna Nicole Smith was blamed for the fall of the Progressive Liberal Party government in 2007. Like Dupuch before him, Marquis was targeted by mass street protests outside The Tribunes offices. Dupuch published a 1967 book, The Tribune Story, about his struggle to keep his paper afloat in the face of enormous odds while raising a young family. The editor-publisher was listed among the three greatest Bahamians of the 20th century in a millennium poll in the year 2000.  Death  Dupuch died on 23 August 1991, aged 92, after catching fire in his garden at his home in Camperdown, Nassau, Bahamas while trying to destroy an ants' nest.

Powered initially by an Hirth HM60R inline, it had fixed undercarriage, mixed wood and fabric covering, and the choice of open or closed cockpit. Powered by the Hirth 60R, it became the Kl 35A (with floats, Kl 35AW), while with the Hirth, it was the Kl 35A (with floats, Kl 35AW). An improved Kl 35D, designed as a Luftwaffe trainer, with Hirth HM 504A-2 engine and the option of ski or float landing gear, appeared in 1938. It was the most numerous, with over three thousand built. A number of air forces purchased copies, including the Romanian, Hungarian, and Slovak. The Swedish Air Force bought several, designated Sk 15, for training use (at least five of those were seaplanes) and in 1941 began licence production, building about 74 more, with some remaining in service until 1951. The Lithuanian air force flew three. Development The Kl 35 was designed in 1934 under the auspices of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM). Dipl. Ing. Friedrich Fecher had overall responsibility for the construction. The so- called Gemischtbauweise construction was used: steel for fuselage, wood for wings and tail units and only small quantities of light alloy for linings were used. This became a preferred building method with the RLM around this time, because from considerations of strategic material availability. =Production= Klemm suffered a setback in 1935 when the prototype Kl 35 crashed during testing at Rechlin. The results of further trial must have been satisfactory, because in July 1936, 23 aircraft were ordered for delivery between July and September 1937, with production planned to increase to 3 per month. Klemm was at the time manufacturing the Fw 44 under licence from Focke- Wulf. By this time the RLM was already looking for a sub-contractor to build the Kl 35A under licence, choosing Fieseler which was already undertaking licence production of the He 72 and Fw 58 alongside Storchs at its Kasseler plant. Further orders, to a total of 1,386, followed and new variants came on line, beginning with the Kl 35B with a new engine. Manufacture at Fieseler ceased in November 1939, after 365 aircraft, when the RLM transferred licence production to Zlin in occupied Czechoslovakia. Production ended in May 1943 with total production for the Luftwaffe having reached 1,302. The balance of production was for private and export customers, though since these would have to number nearly 700 to reach the oft-quoted total of around 2,000 this may be exaggerated.

Early life and education Morris was born in 1700 in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the second son of Lewis Morris and Isabella (née Graham) Morris and named after his father's friend the future colonial governor Robert Hunter. His older brother was Lewis Morris Jr. who served as a member and speaker of the New York General Assembly. His father was very prominent in public life and variously served as Chief Justice of New York and as the 8th Colonial Governor of New Jersey. His paternal grandparents were Sarah (née Pole) Morris and Richard Morris, who was originally from Monmouthshire, Wales. His grandparents bought Morrisania from Samuel Edsall in 1670 and moved there from Barbados. His mother was the eldest daughter of James Graham, who served as the first Speaker of the New York General Assembly and the first Recorder of New York City. Graham, who was born in Midlothian, Scotland, was a grandson of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. He received what was described at the time as a \\"liberal education\\", and received additional training from his father in politics. Political career When his father was named Governor of New Jersey in 1738, his son's name appeared on his list of councilors. Less than a year later, Governor Morris named Robert the Chief Justice of the provincial Supreme Court. His commission was set to run \\"during good behavior of same\\", which differed from that of his predecessor, Robert Lettis Hooper, whose term was determined to run \\"through the royal pleasure\\".

Following a long trip to England in 1749, he was made Deputy Governor of Pennsylvania in 1754 and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1755 after his return. He served as Deputy Governor from 1754 to 1756, during the French and Indian War. (Early governors of Pennsylvania were referred to as \\"deputy governors\\" because Thomas Penn, who resided in England, was the official \\"Governor\\", as well as one of the proprietors of the province along with his brother, Richard Penn. He often clashed with the Assembly over proposals to emit paper money to fund the war. In the spring of 1756, Morris announced volunteer scalping parties. These scalping parties were \\"the only way to clear our Frontier of Savages\\", according to Morris's councilor, James Hamilton. He was the uncle of Congressman Lewis Morris of New York. During the second half of 1755, the contest between the proprietors of the Colony of Pennsylvania (the Penn family) and the Pennsylvania Assembly became a duel between Morris and Benjamin Franklin. The main point of contention was the adamant refusal of the Penns to countenance any tax upon their lands in Pennsylvania, even for provincial defense. During the summer and autumn of 1755, while the frontier burned and the settlers fled for their lives from attacks by French-friendly Indians, the proprietors and the Assembly locked in legislative stalemate. Morris defended the proprietors and Franklin spoke for the people of Pennsylvania. In late July, 1755, the Assembly authorized the expenditure of 50,000 pounds for provincial defense following the defeat of Major General Edward Braddock by the French and Indian soldiers near Fort Duquesne in western Pennsylvania. To raise the money, the Assembly approved a property tax, applicable to all real and personal property within the province. Morris vetoed the tax bill with suggestions for amendment that would exempt the proprietary estates. Franklin drafted the Assembly's response, the gist of which was that taxing the proprietary estates, along with all the other estates in the province, was \\"perfectly equitable and just.\\" Eventually, Morris admitted that the terms of his commission prohibited his accepting any measure that taxed the proprietary estates. This prompted Franklin to bypass Morris and take on the proprietors themselves, which led to Franklin's removal to London in 1757 to argue the Assembly's side in the dispute with the proprietors.Brands, H. W. (2000)\\"The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin\\" First Anchor Books Edition, March 2002. . In 1756, Morris resigned his commission as Chief Justice (which was not accepted) and made another long trip to England. Wiliam Aynsley was made Chief Justice in his absence. When Morris returned in 1760, he claimed he was still Chief Justice on the grounds that his resignation had never been formally accepted. As Aynsley had died and Morris was the best person available to fill the post, he was reinstated and served in that capacity until his own death in 1764. Personal life Morris was married to Elizabeth Stogdell (1673–1752). Together, they were the parents of: * Robert Morris (1745–1815), a prominent judge who corresponded with Thomas Jefferson. * Mary Morris (1746–1831), who in 1765 married Dr. James Boggs, a surgeon who left New York for Nova Scotia during the Revolution. Morris died on 27 January 1764 in Shrewsbury, New Jersey.

The condition is held, by some people, to be analogous to individual amnesia. Cause and effect The causes are various. Employees have an inherent short and selective memory recall alongside a defensiveness that screens out unwelcome events with which they and their employer are involved.Alan M. Kantrow, “The Constraints of Corporate Tradition”, Harper & Row, New York. 1984 Flanking this are the effects of the single biggest change in workplace practice for at least a century - the actively encouraged flexible labor market. In many countries, employee turnover - the rate at which old employees leave and new ones arrive - is now above the recognised annual danger level of 10%Professor Peter Boxall and Dr Erling Rasmussen, research study, University of Auckland Business School, October 2001 in many industry sectors where productivity starts to be affected. What happens, is that the knowledge and experience known as organizational memory (OM) - the unrecorded event-specific, organization-specific and time-specific ‘how’ of know-how that characterizes any organization's ability to perform - walks out of the front door on a regular basis. Jobs change was initially related to downsizing but it is now a general feature of the labor market, where, on average, annual employee churn exceeds 20% in many countries and up 60% in some industries. =Cost= Firstly, the organization has to continually re- learn its tried-and-tested practice. Induction periods of up to 12 months are typical – and expensive, with direct costs variously calculated at 46% of annual pay for a front-line employee to 240% for a middle manager.Washington- based Corporate Leadership Council, 1998 Secondly, the body of evidence that would otherwise be available for better decision-making is reduced, a situation that affects the ability of organizations to learn efficiently from their own experiences. By encouraging high levels of job churn, organizations have consciously chosen to operate in isolation to their own hard-won and expensively acquired experience, depending on others’ unrelated experiences. This is even more expensive than having to re-learn, with experiential non- learning estimated by an international management consultant to cost up to 9.7% of gross domestic product in many developed countries.Proudfoot Consulting, September 2005 Thirdly, with the relationship between knowledge and power intimately linked, the corporate body has – quite deliberately and entirely unwittingly – allowed their command to be displaced. No longer are individuals an aggregate part of an established institution. Individuals are the institution for as long as they remain in situ. Then, when the face changes the institution changes, or, more accurately, tries to change, bereft of its continuity and at the mercy of new brooms. Ordered evolution has become a shapeless revolution with such things as corporate culture, ethos, values and tried and tested usage struggling to maintain an even keel. In effect, the motor of the wealth machine has largely disempowered itself. The cost of this is incalculable. Also known as institutional forgetting, corporate amnesia is among the biggest constraints to decision making excellence and a massive contributor to productivity shortfalls. Knowledge management Both corporate amnesia and organizational memory are part of the new vocabulary associated with the broader discipline known as Knowledge Management (KM) under the even wider umbrella of the Information Age. In its conception, organisational memory (OM) consists of the institution's documentation, objects and artifacts, that are stored in the corporate library/electronic database, and which can be applied alongside resident employees who are intimate with institution-specific events and experiences. The physical evidence is known as explicit knowledge while the more cerebral is called tacit knowledge. They are integral for efficient decision-making and experiential learning to build on success, and escape the pandemic of repeated mistakes, re-invented wheels, and other unlearned lessons that litter modern industry. Because of the high levels of jobs churn in the modern workplace, however, much of the mind-resident tacit knowledge is now non-existent within organizations, with employers believing that the imported tacit knowledge from employees hired from other institutions is an adequate stand-in that can be replaced by osmosis. Tacit knowledge, sometimes called cognitive knowledge or coping skills, is a category of knowledge first identified by the Michael Polanyi in 1958,Michael Polanyi and tacit knowledge described as the non- technical 'how' of getting things done, what Edward de BonoEdward De Bono'S Authorised Website - Home Page calls 'operacy’ or the skill of action, and what Peter Drucker identifies in the use of the word techne (Greek for 'skill'). Much of it is implicit and ambiguous, and is acquired largely by experience that is functional as well as context- and institution-specific. The collective awareness of such knowledge and forms of practice provides the type of expertise that is both an organisation's adhesive and its lubricant - i.e. it relates to all the routines and processes (formal or otherwise) that make an organization tick. Its value represents the capability of the firm and is perhaps the main ingredient of its resilience. In broad-brush terms, it includes the individual's understanding and accommodation of their employer's individual corporate culture, habits, management, communications and decision- making style, the contacts and relationships between employees or teams of employees, the detail of job-related events and the knowledge of tried and tested usage as it applies to the organization's own market circumstances and special environment (so-called episodic memory). The qualitative application of organisational memory is closely allied to memory, which is most commonly described as knowledge retention or the difference between having acquired knowledge and having to re-acquire it. It is what is not forgotten; the reconstruction of experienced events. Organizational memory For practical purposes, organizational memory (OM) can be broken down into three distinct time frames. Short-term OM lasts up to about five years; medium-term OM occupies a time frame of up to around ten years, with periods in excess of this constituting long-term OM. Typically existing only in the minds of individuals, it is normally very difficult to share and to capture. Because of its contemporary and contiguous nature, short- and medium-term OM is generally more relevant to operational issues facing the organization, whilst long-term OM is more conformant with strategy and culture. The phenomenon of corporate amnesia was first identified by the British knowledge management specialist Arnold Kransdorff in his 1998 book of the same name.‘Corporate Amnesia: Keeping know-how in the company’, Butterworth Heinemann By then the flexible labor market had been in tow for more than two decades. Employees in many developed countries, who could previously be expected to have had one or two jobs in their working lifetimes, were now employer-hopping every four or five years in a workplace where redundancy was – and still is - commonplace. Capture tools Knowledge loss is not entirely ignored in industry and commerce. In an attempt to capture and use its departing know-how, some organizations depend on intranets, electronic bulletin boards, theatrical improvisations, social networks and mentoring, but these channels all suffer from the effects of individuals’ memory loss, their defensiveness about failures, short jobs tenure and – above all – an inability to apply employee- specific precedent to better decision-making. To date the management of organizational memory is an unformalized discipline, not least because of the widespread lack of understanding of tacit knowledge, the prevalent belief that experiential learning is all about learning from others’ experience – what is called benchmarking - and the informal and theoretical ways managers are taught how to benefit from hindsight. The latest capture tools to get attention Arnold Kransdorff - consultancy and advice to industries seeking solutions to common management problems are the traditional corporate history, usually seen as a public relations medium, and oral debriefing, an augmentation of the old-fashioned prescriptive and formulaic exit interview. The former is being produced as an induction/educational tool that transmits long-term memory while the latter, which concentrates on short- and medium- term memory, targets exiting and key occupant employees, recurring corporate events and important projects in detailed testimony of participants. Both are designed to extract tacit knowledge in an easily accessible format that also generates the ‘lessons of history’. Its permanent character also means that it does not have to be continually reproduced and that its necessary re- interpretation alongside changing circumstances is predicated on a more reliable evidential base. In the world of evidential gathering where rigorous substantiation is a pre-requisite for experiential learning, the oral route is seen as more valuable than anything extracted from internally produced written sources. The reason its developers give is that individuals are generally better speakers than they are writers. Also, their spoken word is invariably a more efficient way of conveying the abstract and complex nature of ‘humanware’ elements like the nuances of corporate culture, management style and the often-obscure issues surrounding decision-making within groups. To further formalize what up to now has been a largely theoretical teaching process, the capture methodologies have also been applied directly to decision-making through an adaptation to the modern workplace of the experiential learning models developed by academic David Kolb and others’.‘Corporate DNA: Using Organizational Memory to improve poor decision-making’, Gower Publishing Sabotage Corporate amnesia can be a result of sabotage by a disgruntled employee. If an employee is sacked, or is aggrieved for some other reason, he/she may seek revenge by deleting files from the company's computer. This risk can be minimised by effective backup procedures.

He was born in Perth, the son of John Mylne, also a master mason, and Helen Kenneries. He married Isobel Wilson in 1610 and had two sons, John, and Alexander, both of whom followed him into the building profession, and a daughter, Barbara, who was later accused of witchcraft in Edinburgh. He learned his craft through assisting his father on his Tay Bridge construction project at Perth.Colvin, p.568-9 In 1616 he was invited to Edinburgh to work on a statue of James VI for the Netherbow Port, or city gate, after the previous mason, Frenchman Benjamin Lambert, had died before completing the commission.Howard, p.113 Mylne also rebuilt the mercat cross in the High Street, and was made a burgess of Edinburgh in June 1617. In 1620 he was contracted to build a new church at Falkland in Fife for David Murray, Lord Scone. The contract stipulated that the church was to be built precisely to Lord Scone's specifications, and left Mylne little room for architectural input.Howard, p.186. The church was completely rebuilt in the 1850s. Between 1622 and 1629 he built the tolbooth steeple in Aberdeen, and was rewarded by being made a burgess of that royal burgh in May 1622. In 1627 he was further made a burgess of Dundee in right of his father. Following this he carried out alterations to Drummond House for David Drummond, Earl of Perth, which included the sundial in the grounds. On the death of William Wallace in 1631, Mylne was appointed Master Mason to the Crown, and returned to Edinburgh. His first royal commission came shortly before this, in 1629, when he was tasked with the construction of a large pond at the palace of Holyroodhouse. With the assistance of his two sons, he also erected a large polyhedral sundial at Holyrood for Charles I, on the occasion of his Scottish coronation in 1633. The sundial, which bears numerous Stuart emblems, is the earliest surviving polyhedral example in the country. Mylne was paid £408 15s 6d (Scots) for the work.Howard, p.44 He held his royal post for five years, before resigning it in favour of his eldest son John in 1636, when he left Edinburgh. In 1643 Mylne was made a burgess of Kirkcaldy, following his work to repair and enlarge the parish kirk. Over the following years he was engaged on several public works in Dundee, including the church steeple, tolbooth, and the royal burgh's fortifications. Mylne was also a prominent Freemason, a member of the Lodge of Edinburgh from 1633, and Master of the Lodge of Scone from 1621 to 1627. He is buried against the southern wall of Greyfriars Churchyard in Perth, close to the southern pedestrian gate. The stone was erected by Robert Mylne and has been restored many times.

Mylne was Master of the Mason's Lodge at Scone at a time when the mason's lodges were moving away from being simply craft guilds, and he admitted King James VI to the lodge as a Freeman Mason. From 1604 to 1617 he was engaged planning and executing an eleven-arched bridge across the River Tay at Perth. Mylne was made a burgess of Perth in 1607, although his bridge was destroyed by a flood in October 1621, just four years after completion, and shortly after Mylne's death. In 1620 he was engaged by the Laird of Scone to build a new church at Falkland, which he worked on with the assistance of his son until his death.

During her career as a clandestine senior controller in MI6 (1943-1993) she was stationed in Moscow (1954-1956), Austria (1946-1948), the Congo (1959-1961), Zambia (1964-1967) and Hanoi (1969-1971). Early life and education Daphne Park was born to John Alexander and Doreen Gwynneth Park. Her father had contracted tuberculosis as a young man and was sent to Africa for rest and recuperation. He moved from South Africa to Nyasaland (now Malawi), and served as an intelligence officer during World War I. Thereafter he worked as a tobacco farmer and as an alluvial gold prospector in Tanganyika (now Tanzania). When Daphne was six months old she travelled to Africa with her mother to join him there. Park had a brother, David who died aged 14. When she was 11, Daphne Park returned to England and was educated at Rosa Bassett School in Streatham and at Somerville College, Oxford, where she graduated with a B.A. in modern languages in 1943. She was further educated at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she received a Certificate of Competent Knowledge in Russian in 1952. Career On graduating in 1943, Park turned down jobs in the Treasury and the Foreign Office to make a direct contribution to the war effort. She then joined the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY). During the selection process for FANY, she came to the attention of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), due to her understanding of ciphers. Park was promoted to the rank of sergeant and trained groups of operatives for Operation Jedburgh, whose task was to support the Resistance in Europe. In 1945 Park went to work as a briefing and dispatching officer in North Africa. On her return in 1946 she was sent to Vienna to establish an office for the Field Intelligence Agency Technical (FIAT), a unit of the Allied Commission responsible for tracking down former Axis scientists. In 1948, she was attached to the Foreign Office, while actually working for the Secret Intelligence Service (aka SIS/MI6), becoming Third Secretary of the United Kingdom's delegation to NATO in 1952. She then became Second Secretary of the British Embassy in Moscow between 1954 and 1956. From 1959 to 1961 she was Consul and First Secretary to Léopoldville, which in practice meant being head of MI6 there. British parliamentarian David Lea wrote that shortly before she died, she claimed to have been involved organising the abduction and murder of Patrice Lumumba during the Congo Crisis. Park (allegedly) confided to Lea that the reasoning behind the assassination was MI6 fears that Lumumba would hand over the high-value Katangese uranium (Shinkolobwe) deposits as well as the diamonds and other important minerals largely located in the secessionist eastern state of Katanga to the Russians.Letters, We did it, London Review of Books, Vol. 35 No. 7, 11 April 2013 The Shinkolobwe uranium mine provided the uranium used by the Manhattan Project, including in atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.Compare: She rose further through the ranks of the Foreign Office to be High Commissioner to Lusaka from 1964 to 1967 and then Consul-General to Hanoi from 1969 to 1970. In 1972 she was named as Chargé d'Affaires of the British Embassy of Ulan Bator for several months. From 1973 onwards she served in the Foreign Office then retired two years early in 1979 to become Principal of Somerville College, Oxford.

Victor was a Roman soldier who was tortured and killed; Corona was killed for comforting him. Corona is venerated in connection with treasure-hunting and, since 2020, with the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Legend Their legend states that Victor was a Roman soldier of Italian ancestry, who was tortured, including having his eyes gouged out, and was beheaded. Most sources state that he and Corona were killed in Roman Syria during the reign of Marcus Aurelius (around the 160s-170s AD), but various hagiographical texts disagree about the site of their martyrdom, with some stating that it was Damascus, while Coptic sources state that it was Antioch. Some Western sources state that Alexandria or Sicily was their place of martyrdom. They also disagree about the date of their martyrdom. They may have been martyred during the reign of Antoninus Pius, or Diocletian, while the Roman Martyrology states that it was in the third century when they met their death. While he was suffering from the tortures, the sixteen-year-old wife of another soldier, named Corona or Stephanie (or Stefania or Stephana, from Greek στέφᾰνος, stéphanos, \\"crown\\", the Greek version of her Latin name, which also means \\"crown\\")Acta sanctorum: Ed. novissima (1866), vol. 16, p. 265Le martyrologe d'Usuard (1867), p. 270 comforted and encouraged him. For this, she was arrested and interrogated. According to the passio of Corona, Corona was bound to two bent palm trees and torn apart as the trunks were released; the passio is considered largely fictional, and she herself may also be fictional. Other sources state that Victor and Corona were husband and wife. There is also debate as to where Corona was from; differing accounts place her in Syria, Sicily, and Marseille. Veneration Victor and Corona's memorial day is 24 November (11 November in the Orthodox church calendar). Their feast day is 14 May. Outside the town of Feltre in northern Italy, on the slopes of Mount Miesna, is the church of SS. Vittore e Corona, erected by the Crusaders from Feltre after the First Crusade. Corona is especially venerated in Austria and eastern Bavaria. There is a chapel dedicated to her in Sauerlach, near Munich. There are two churches named after her in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Passau and two towns named after her in Lower Austria. A statue of her stands in the Münster Cathedral. Around 1000 AD Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor brought Corona's relics to Aachen in western Germany. Her relics were rediscovered during excavation work at Aachen Cathedral in 1910. The relics were removed from a crypt and placed in a shrine inside the cathedral. Corona is the patroness of causes involving money, such as gambling and treasure hunting, a result of a later treasure hunter who credited his success to invoking her.Emily McFarlan Miller, Is St. Corona the patron saint of pandemics?, March 23, 2020, National Catholic ReporterJean Hopfensperger, Seeking hope during the pandemic, some turn to little-known St. Corona, March 22, 2020, Minneapolis Star Tribune She is called upon by a treasure hunter to bring treasure, and then sent away through a similarly elaborate ritual. In March 2020 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh suggested invoking her for support of the world economy during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. She was not historically a patron saint of or invoked against pandemics or disease, but has been invoked against the current pandemic. Her relics will be available for public veneration once the pandemic has passed.

It had a twin-boom UAV with a surveillance pod, from which the imagery was data linked to a ground control station (GCS) that also controlled the aircraft in flight. It was the third generation of UAV in British Army service with the Royal Artillery after SD/1 and Canadair Midge. The Phoenix was a fairly typical combat surveillance UAV, powered by a 20 kW (26 hp) piston engine, but is distinctive in that it is a \\"tractor\\" aircraft, with the propeller in the front. This tends to obstruct a sensor turret, and so the sensor payload, built around an infrared imager, was carried in a pod slung well under the fuselage. Phoenix was mostly made of Kevlar and other plastics. Phoenix was 'zero-length' launch being projected into the air from a launch- rail mounted on the back of a truck. The launch rail having been originally developed for the US Army Aquilla UAV that failed to enter service. The Phoenix was recovered by parachute, landing on its back, with a crushable \\"hump\\" on the back taking up the impact. The zero-length take-off and landing was an essential requirement for operating in NATO's Central Region and deployment in a forward divisional area. Maximum flight time was around 4 hours. Phoenix sensors provided imagery direct to the GCS where it was analysed and reported to artillery headquarters, to command level, or to a Phoenix troop command post. The principal method of communication from the GCS to artillery on the ground was via the Battlefield Artillery Target Engagement System (BATES). The UAV could be launched within an hour of reaching its launch site. A second UAV can be launched within a further eight minutes and up to two UAVs can be controlled from the same ground station. The name Phoenix was taken from Project Phoenix, a late 1970s study into surveillance and target acquisition needs after cancellation of the unsuccessful development of Westland MRUASTAS to replace AN/USD501 Midge. The first flight was in 1986, with an expectation that it would enter service in 1989, but the project suffered from numerous delays. The Phoenix eventually entered service in 1999, and saw limited operational use as part of the British contribution to Kosovo Force (KFOR) and in Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Phoenix attrition was high during the Iraq campaign, though British Army officials say it gave excellent service for artillery spotting, stating that some of the losses were due to deliberate sacrifices, in which the UAV was kept on station beyond the time it could be recovered rather than let targets get away. The system was operated by the 32nd Regiment Royal Artillery. The final operational sortie was conducted in May 2006,Unmanned Air Vehicle Regiment bids farewell to the Phoenix - UK MoD although it was not formally retired until 20 March 2008. An international competition designated \\"Watchkeeper\\" was set up for a next-generation UAV system in 2002.

The greater the likelihood of an event happening the higher this price will be. A price of 91-93, for example, suggests the betting broker which offers the bet believes the event has a 92% likelihood of happening. An event can be bought or sold, making it possible to profit both from the event occurring or not occurring. A bettor who thinks that the event will occur will buy the bet and a bettor who thinks the event won't occur will sell the bet. An event could be, for example, the \\"FTSE to close 11 points higher by midday\\", \\"the FTSE will end higher on the day\\", \\"Brent Oil will close between 50 and 60 cents lower\\" and so on. Types of Binary bets #Up/Down - This is the most basic form of binary betting, and the one most bettors will take. A bettor who wishes to buy this bet has to decide if the asset or market will close above or below the current spot price by the end of the trading day. #Rise/Fall #Higher/Lower - Here a trader is betting on the high or low of today being a given distance from yesterday’s closing level. #Touch/No-Touch #In/Out Calculating winnings and losses Binary bet winnings and losses are calculated in the following manner: When BUYING, Profit/Loss = The closing price minus the opening price times your bet size (per point) When SELLING, Profit/Loss = The opening price minus the closing price times your bet size (per point) Example One: The bet is that \\"the FTSE will close higher on the day\\". The price is 38-43. You BUY (agree with the proposition) at 43 for £5 per point. The FTSE does close higher on the day, meaning that the bet makes up at 100. Therefore your winnings are: (100 - 43) x £5 = £285 Example Two: The same bet, that \\"the FTSE will close higher on the day\\". The price is 38-43. You BUY (agree with the proposition) at 43 for £5 per point. The FTSE does NOT close higher on the day, meaning that the bet makes up at 0. Therefore your winnings - or losses in this case - are: (0 - 43) x £5 = -£215 Example Three: The same bet, that \\"the FTSE will close higher on the day\\". The price is 38-43. You SELL (disagree with the proposition) at 38 for £5 per point. The FTSE does NOT close higher on the day, meaning that the bet makes up at 0. Therefore your winnings are: (38 - 0) x £5 = £190 =Floating or Fixed Binaries?= A Floating Binary is the most common type of binary bet. It is a bet where the binary price moves but the strike price (the price the market needs to reach for the event to occur and therefore make up at either 100 or 0) is fixed. For example, if the bet is \\"Brent Oil will end down on the day\\" the Buy and Sell prices will change throughout the course of the bet, but the proposition itself will remain the same. A Fixed Binary is a bet where the binary price remains fixed but the strike price (the price the market needs to reach for the event to occur and therefore make up at 100) is moving. For example, if the bet is that \\"GBP/USD will end up 25 points by the end of the betting period\\", and you can buy this at 95, the buy price would remain at 95 though the target price for the bet might change to GBP/USD being up 21 then 19 then 13 then 7 etc. Floating and Fixed Binary bets are fundamentally distinct. With Floating Binaries the buy and sell prices float whilst the target price remains static. With Fixed Binaries the buy and sell prices remain fixed whilst the target price moves. Closing Out a floating binary bet A Floating Binary bet - and only a Floating Binary bet - can be closed out before the end of the lifetime of the bet. This allows you to take an early profit or cut your losses if the bet is going against you. If you bought you can sell the same amount to close, or if you sold you can buy the same amount to close. Further, you can perform a partial close where you buy or sell less than you originally sold or bought, therefore leaving part of the bet running. For example, we may offer a price of 32-35 for \\"the FTSE to finish up at the end of the day\\". You think the FTSE will rise, so you Buy at 35 for £10 a point. Later in the day the FTSE has risen and we are now offering a price of 80-83. To close this bet and take an early profit you would Sell at 80 points for the same bet size, ie £10 a point. Your profit on the bet would be (80 - 35) x £10 = £450.

The American writer John Updike once wrote that he \\"may be France's foremost living sculptor, but he is little known in the United States\\". He and other critics noted sharp contrasts between rough and smooth, abstract and realistic, tender and violent, delicate and crude, and many other paired oppositions in his artwork, and his recurrent themes of sex, birth, growth, decay, death, and resurrection. Ipoustéguy was unafraid to depict emotional intensity in a sometimes controversial way; several of his major commissioned works were rejected, but later installed as planned, or in other locations. Early life and education In 1920, Jean- Robert Ipoustéguy was born \\"Jean Robert\\" in Dun-sur-Meuse, between Verdun and Sedan, in the recent aftermath of the ruinous trench warfare of World War I. Jean's father was a joiner, earning a living by producing fine woodwork, who also enjoyed painting, violin playing, and amateur theatrical productions. He also had a great love of reading, which he passed on to his son, who did very well in school. The artist later remembered his father as \\"soft and sweet\\", but recalled his mother as being \\"strict\\". As a boy, Ipoustéguy played in the surrounding fields, but as he dug into the earth, he would sense the presence of death beneath him. He harbored a secret ambition to become a painter, but he hid this from his father, who held the profession in low regard. At the age of 18, Ipoustéguy moved to Paris, where he got a job as a legal clerk and courier. On a winter afternoon in 1938, he saw a poster offering an evening art class taught by Robert Lesbounit, and signed up immediately. The teacher encouraged him to read books far beyond the level of his classmates, and introduced him to a deeper understanding of art history through visits to the Louvre and art galleries. Lesbounit recognized his student's talent, and they would become lifelong friends. At these evening classes, he also met the sculptor known as \\"Adam\\" (Henri Georges Adam). Art studies were disrupted by World War II and the German invasion of France. Ipoustéguy was mobilized into the French artillery, and relocated to southwest France. Under the Vichy regime, he was assigned as an ironworker and cement worker on the Atlantic Wall and later the submarine base at Bordeaux, incidentally acquiring practical skills he would later use in his artworks. During this difficult period, he produced drawings when he could, such as Soldat endormi (Soldier asleep, 1941) and Sanguine nu de femme (Fiery female nude, 1941). After the Liberation of France, he returned to Paris to resume his art studies with Robert Lesbounit, finishing his evening course of study in 1946. Career L'homme (1963) Lecture (1985) combines figurative and abstract elements L'Homme Aux Semelles Devant (1985) Fontaine Béraudier (1987) Porte du Ciel (2000) In 1947-48, he joined a \\"collective\\" of teachers and young artists creating frescos and stained glass windows for the church of Saint-Jacques, Petit-Montrouge, Paris. In 1949, he set up his studio in Choisy-le-Roi, approximately southeast of the center of Paris, and began to work on sculpture. His workspace was in an old ceramics factory, which he gradually took over and converted into a family living space, filled with completed sculpture and works-in-progress. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the artist began to append his mother's Basque maiden name, \\"Ipoustéguy\\", after his given name, since \\"Robert\\" is a very common surname in France. In 1953, he turned away from oil painting and dedicated himself to the production of sculpture, in spite of a warning from Kahnweiler, his art dealer at the time, that it would not sell. Ipoustéguy continued to produce numerous drawings, watercolors, and writings throughout the remainder of his career. For a few years his sculptures were mostly abstract, and he resisted a temptation to make figurative work which was unfashionable at the time. For example, Cénotaphe (1957) was a purely abstract, geometric artwork, a stainless steel memorial to deceased absence. Ipoustéguy gradually moved towards figurative work, and some of his early sculptures were abstracted heads in bronze, such as Jeanne d'Arc (Joan of Arc, 1957), Roger Binne (1959), Homme qui rit (Man who laughs, 1960), and Tete de mort (Skull, 1961). A figurative work from this time was Étude de femme (Study of woman, 1959). In 1962, he established a relationship with the Paris gallery of Claude Bernard, which would last for the rest of his life. Around this time, on a honeymoon trip to Greece, he rediscovered artwork from the 5th century BCE. This was a revelation which inspired the artist to intensify his focus on the nude and the anatomy of the human body. Upon his return, he made La Terre (Earth) and Homme (Man), two large bronze nudes that would characterize his renewed interest in the human figure. In 1964, he had his first overseas show, at the Albert Loeb Gallery in New York City. His work was recognized and acquired by at least six American museums, and by the Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller Collection in New York. In 1965, he completed Ecbatane, a major work portraying Alexander the Great contemplating the ancient city of Ecbatana. It was his first work using the novel material polystyrene, which would be cast in bronze using a technique similar to lost-wax casting. The new sculptural medium allowed him to explore increased levels of detail and texture in his work. In 1966–1967, he returned for a while to figurative painting, mostly in white hues reminiscent of marble, but also produced Homme passant la porte (Man traversing the door) and La femme au bain (Woman in the bath), two masterworks in bronze which would win him wide acclaim. In August 1967, he went to the Nicoli studio in Carrare, to try his hand at sculpting marble. Within a week, he had completed La grande coude (The great elbow), a flexed arm with bulging muscles and veins. In February 1968, Ipoustéguy's father died. The sculptor had been working on a white marble commemoration of Pope John XXIII, which he then modified by incorporating images of his deceased father's hands and face into Mort du père (Death of the father). The work became famous for its acquisition by the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, after a parliamentary debate about the high price it commanded. He also carved the intricate white marble sculpture L'Agonie de la mère (Agony of the mother) to memorialize his mother's recent death from breast cancer. The May 1968 events in France affected Ipoustéguy, who produced a series of political posters during Le temps des cerises (\\"The time of the cherries\\"). In 1968, he also produced Naissance (Birth), in both white marble and polished bronze versions, and Sein tactile (Tactile breast) a white marble sculpture that visually invited sensuous caresses. In 1970 he produced La brouette (Wheelbarrow), Lune de miel (Honeymoon), and Le calice (Chalice), small, frankly erotic sculptures. In 1971, he received his first official commission, for Homme forçant l'unitė (Man forcing unity), installed at the Franco-German nuclear physics research center at Grenoble. In 1975, Ipoustéguy was awarded a major commission from the United States, La mort de l'évêque Neumann (Death of Bishop Neumann), to commemorate John Neumann, the country's first Catholic bishop to be canonized. According to legend, he had collapsed suddenly in the street, dying ignored by all except a little blind girl. Ipoustéguy modeled the girl after his own recently deceased daughter Céline. Upon presentation of the composite white marble and bronze artwork, it was thought to be too violent and emotional, so it was rejected. He also completed Érose en sommeil (Eros in sleep), a complex marble work depicting intertwined hands. In 1976, he completed Maison (House), a two-piece polished bronze showing a frank heterosexual coupling as the framework and foundation of the domestic environment, and the boldly anatomical abstract Triptyche. He also produced Petit écorché (Little flayed one) and Scène comique de la vie moderne (Comic scene of modern life), both depicting frantic figures; the latter one was later displayed clutching a real red-colored telephone. In 1977, he received a commission from the Val-de-Grâce hospital; the namesake bronze sculpture was rejected twice, before being accepted and installed in the new hospital entry rotunda. The sculpture shows a standing nude figure, apparently shedding an anguished skin or shell, and supported by robust tubular elements. In 1978, he had a retrospective show at the Fondation Nationale des Arts Graphiques et Plastiques (National Foundation of Graphic and Plastic Arts) in Paris. In 1979, he had a retrospective show at the Kunsthalle in Berlin, featuring 242 of his artworks. The same year, his largest sculpture, L'homme construit sa ville (Man builds his city), was installed at the Congress Centre in Berlin. In 1982 Louise Labé, at Place Louis Pradel in Lyon In 1985 L'homme aux semelles devant (à Rimbaud) (Man with soles in front, to Rimbaud), in Paris In 1989 A la santé de la Révolution (To the health of the Revolution) in Bagnolet (France) In 1991, Nicolas Appert in Châlons en Champagne (France) In 1998, he produced Âge des interrogations and Âge des conclusions, reflections on approaching mortality. In 1999, Porte du Ciel (Door of the Sky), Braunschweig (Germany) In 2001 Ipoustéguy installed his sculpture La mort de l'évêque Neumann (cast in 1976), which had been rejected by the Americans almost a quarter-century earlier. He placed it in the church of Dun-sur-Meuse, near his birthplace. That same year, a catalogue raisonné of his artworks was published by Éditions la Différence. A new Centre culturel Ipoustéguy (Ipoustéguy Cultural Center) was opened in the town of his birth, featuring dozens of artworks donated by the artist. In 2003 he returned to Dun-sur-Meuse, settling a few hundred meters from the house where he was born, and near the Centre culturel Ipoustéguy. Ipoustéguy died in 2006, at the age of 86. He is buried at Cimetière de Montparnasse, Paris, in a tomb which features one of his sculptures. His first posthumous retrospective exhibition was at the Palazzo Leone da Perego, in Legnano, Italy (October 2008 to February 2009). Throughout his career, he had produced many paintings in oil, watercolor, and gouache, and many drawings in charcoal, some of which were displayed alongside his sculptural work. Artistic style L'Homme (1963) depicts a nude figure standing on three legs Ipoustéguy's early sculptural work was mostly abstract, but starting around 1959 his work focused on the human figure (either complete or in anatomical fragments), often combined with abstract elements. His figures often show aspects of the écorché style used by French anatomists, with layers of skin and muscle partially dissected. Ipoustéguy's prime work often emphasizes contrasts between smooth finishes and a roughness of \\"decay or willful destruction\\". Ipoustéguy has remarked: J'ai cassé l'oeuf de Brancusi (\\"I broke Brancusi's egg\\"). He could skillfully render the textures of fragile materials such as cloth or paper in his favored sculptural media, durable stone and bronze. Ipoustéguy's sculptures often depict multiple points of view or points in time simultaneously, resulting in human figures with three arms, three legs, or multiple profiles. Secondary elements may be bodily shells or carapaces, sometimes mounted on hinges. His work was influenced by Surrealism, freely combining realistic elements with the fantastical, and focusing on social issues, sex, birth, growth, decay, death, and resurrection as major themes. The frankness and uncensored directness of some of his artistic output led to objections from a few religious and political groups; nevertheless, his work is displayed at French embassies and major museums throughout the world. Despite his focus on the human figure, Ipoustéguy also produced large abstract sculptures, such as Sun, Moon, Heaven (1999). Ipoustéguy also wrote extensively throughout his life, and granted many interviews, but relatively little has been translated into English. Personal life In his prime, Ipoustéguy was a sturdy, squat, stocky (\\"trapu\\") man, with strong arms and hands, and was often photographed working bare-chested. He married Geneviève Gilles in 1943, and they had a son, Dominique, in 1945. In 1963, he married Françoise Delacouturiere, producing two daughters, Céline (1965) and Marie-Pierre (1969). In the late 1960s, his art took a more somber turn, affected by the deaths of both his parents and some of his friends. He memorialized his father in La mort du père (Death of the father, 1968), and his mother's death from breast cancer in L'Agonie de la mère (Agony of the mother, 1968). The theme of mortality became more prominent in his work. In November 1974, he learned via telephone that his 10-year-old daughter Céline had died suddenly, a brutal shock which caused him to abandon work for a time. At his death in 2006, he was survived by Françoise Robert (his second wife), and by his children Dominique and Marie-Pierre. They are credited with helping to support a posthumous retrospective exhibition at the Palazzo Leone da Perego, in Legnano, Italy.

Early life  John was born in April 1815 at Polefield near Prestwich, Lancashire. He was the elder son of Sir Thomas Potter and his second wife, Esther née Bayley. His father was involved in business and politics in the rapidly developing town of Manchester, and was named as the borough's first mayor when it was granted a charter of incorporation. John grew up on the family estate at Buile Hill, Pendleton after its completion in 1827.Beatrice Claire Potter, great-great niece He was educated at the University of Edinburgh.  Political career  Potter took no part in public life until the death of his father in March 1845. He was given his father's aldermanic seat on Manchester Town Council and made a justice of the peace for the borough. He elected to serve as Mayor of Manchester in 1848, serving three terms until 1851. During the visit of Queen Victoria to Manchester he was invested as a knight bachelor on 10 October 1851. In the same year he was made deputy lieutenant of the County Palatine of Lancaster. During his term of office the Free Library was founded an institution to which he made a number of donations. In politics he was stated to be an \\"Advanced Liberal\\" in favour of the widening of the electoral franchise. He continued to be a member of Manchester Town Council until his death. He was the head of Potter, Morris & Company, a large firm of Manchester merchants. The greatest of his many contributions to Manchester was the founding of its Free Library.After the Free Libraries Act was passed in 1850, Sir John Potter, the Mayor of Manchester, led a campaign to collect subscriptions to purchase a building and the books to put in it. Cash subscriptions and donations of books came flooding in from all corners, from the working men's committee to Prince Albert himself. In September 1852 Manchester became the first authority to establish a rate-supported public lending and reference library under the Free Libraries Act (Salford opened its library in 1850 but this was under the earlier Museums Act). The Manchester Free Public Library opened at the Hall of Science, Campfield (near the site of what is now the Air and Space Hall of the Museum of Science and Industry). Its first librarian was the prominent public library campaigner Edward Edwards. Queen Victoria visited Manchester in 1851 and during the course of that visit she conferred on him the honour of a knighthood on 10 October 1851.Obituary in Manchester Guardian dated 26 October 1858 At the 1857 general election, he was elected as one two members of parliament (MPs) for Manchester. However, he suffered from ill health from the time he entered parliament, and declared his intention to resign his seat.  Death  Sir John died in office on 25 October 1858 at the age of 43 at Beech House, Eccles.

Although Milbourne spent most of his big league career playing second base, he also played shortstop, third base, and left field. Milbourne compiled a career MLB batting average of .254, with 71 doubles, 24 triples, 11 home runs, and 184 runs batted in (RBI), in 989 games played. During his playing days, he stood tall, weighing . Milbourne was a switch hitter who threw right-handed. Early life Milbourne was born on February 14, 1951 in the Port Norris section of Commercial Township, New Jersey.Larry Milbourne, New York Yankees. Accessed July 23, 2014. He attended Cumberland County College in Vineland, New Jersey. Professional career =Early career= On June 18, 1969, Milbourne signed as an amateur free agent with the Baltimore Orioles. Baltimore assigned him to their rookie-level minor league affiliate, the Bluefield Orioles of the Appalachian League. With Bluefield that season, Milbourne batted .305 with 75 hits, 10 doubles, six triples, and four home runs in 68 games played. Defensively, he played shortstop. On April 7, 1970, he was released by Baltimore. At the start of the 1971 season, after being out of professional baseball for a season, Milbourne was signed by the San Francisco Giants. The Giants assigned him to their Class-A affiliate, the Decatur Commodores of the Midwest League. In 123 games with the Commodores that season, he batted .301 with 69 runs scored, 156 hits, 23 doubles, five triples, five home runs, 38 runs batted in (RBIs), and 21 stolen bases. In the field, Milbourne primarily played second base, but also saw limited time at shortstop and third base. He led the league in hits, plate appearances (543), and at-bats (518) that season. At the end of the 1971 season, Milbourne was selected by the California Angels in the minor league draft. During the 1972 season, Milbourne played his first and only season in the Angels organization. He was assigned to the Double-A Shreveport Captains of the Texas League. He batted .264 with 110 hits, 14 doubles, five triples, and two home runs in 122 games played that year. On defense, he only played second base. After the season, Milbourne was again selected in the minor league draft, this time by the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1973, the Cardinals assigned him to the Triple-A Tulsa Oilers, where he batted .283 with 104 hits, 13 doubles, six triples, and five home runs in 111 games played. The Cardinals added Milbourne to their 40-man roster after the season. =Houston Astros= During the 1973 Rule 5 draft, Milbourne was selected by the Houston Astros from the St. Louis Cardinals. He started the season with the Astros in 1974. On April 6, against the San Francisco Giants, Milbourne made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut, but did not make a plate appearance. His offensive debut came on April 9, against the San Diego Padres, where he went hitless in one at-bat. Milbourne got his first MLB hit on April 11, against the Padres. In his first major league season, Milbourne batted .279 with 31 runs scored, 38 hits, two doubles, one triple, and nine RBIs in 112 games played. In the field, he played 87 games at second base, eight games at shortstop, and four games in left field. After the season, Milbourne was named to the Topps All- Star Rookie Team. At the start of spring training in 1975, Milbourne failed to report to the Houston Astros, and his whereabouts were unknown. However, he did eventually report and made his season debut on April 8, against the Atlanta Braves. On September 23, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, Milbourne hit his first career MLB home run. That season, Milbourne batted .212 with 17 runs scored, 32 hits, one double, two triples, one home run, and nine RBIs in 73 games played. Defensively, Milbourne was positioned at second base for 43 games, and 22 at shortstop. He also played in 24 games in the minor leagues that season with the Astros Triple-A affiliate, the Iowa Oaks. With the Oaks, Milbourne batted .221 with nine runs scored, 17 hits, three doubles, one triple, one home run, and six RBIs in 86 at-bats. He made the Astros major league roster out of spring training in 1976. On May 2, 1976, in the first game of a doubleheader against the New York Mets, Milbourne hit a game-winning single in the ninth inning. In the majors that year, he batted .248 with 22 runs scored, 36 hits, four doubles, and seven RBIs in 59 games played. In the field, he played exclusively at second base. In June 1976, Milbourne was optioned to the minor leagues. In the minors that season, he played with the Triple-A Memphis Blues, batting .325 with 45 runs scored, 95 hits, 12 doubles, two triples, five home runs, 31 RBIs, and 12 stolen bases in 71 games played. =Seattle Mariners= On March 30, 1977, the Seattle Mariners acquired Milbourne from the Houston Astros in exchange for Roy Thomas. Milbourne delivered the Mariners first game-winning hit on April 8, 1977. During the 1977 season, he batted .219 with 24 runs scored, 53 hits, 10 doubles, two home runs, and 21 RBIs in 86 games played. On defense, he played 41 games at second base, 40 games at shortstop, and one game at third base. He also played one game as the Mariners designated hitter. He again made the Mariners roster in 1978. Milbourne commented on his role as the Mariners utility infielder that year by saying, \\"I know it's my role to fill in. [...] I'd prefer to play more\\". On August 3, Milbourne got another game-winning hit, this time against the Minnesota Twins. On the season, he batted .226 with 31 runs scored, 53 hits, six doubles, two triples, two home runs, and 20 RBIs in 93 games played.

In 1979, Milbourne made the Mariners Opening Day roster for the third consecutive season. In 123 games played that year, he batted .278 with 40 runs scored, 99 hits, 13 doubles, four triples, two home runs, and 26 RBIs. Defensively, Milbourne played 65 games at shortstop, 49 at second base, and 11 at third base. =Later career= In 1980, the Seattle Mariners traded him to the New York Yankees. From the Yankees, Milbourne was traded to the Minnesota Twins in 1982. A few months after, the Twins traded him to the Cleveland Indians. After the 1982 season, the Indians sold him to the Philadelphia Phillies, who sold him back to the Yankees in 1983. After the 1983 season, the Yankees traded him back to the Mariners. Seattle released him following the 1984 season, and Milbourne subsequently retired.

It's one of the world's most successful implementations of integrated pest management. The program has enabled cotton farmers to reduce their use of pesticides by between 40-100%, and increase their yields by at least 10%, since its inception in the 1970s. By the autumn of 2009, eradication was finished in all US cotton regions with the exception of less than one million acres still under treatment in Texas.Current Status of Boll Weevil Eradication Program, National Cotton Council, Fall 2009 History Since its migration from Mexico in the late 19th century, the boll weevil had been the single most destructive cotton pest in the United States, and possibly the most destructive agricultural pest in the United States. The cost of its crop depredations has been estimated at $300 million per year.Boll weevil economic impacts The control measures used have included a wide range of pesticides, including calcium arsenate, DDT, toxaphene, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, malathion, and parathion. In 1958, the National Cotton Council garnered the Congressional support to create the USDA Boll Weevil Research Lab. Status of the program in 2006 In 1959 J. R. Brazzel and L. D. Newsom published a paper outlining the winter dormancy (diapause) behavior of the boll weevil. Brazzel published the results of his first diapause control insecticide treatment trial in 1959, finding that methyl parathion treatments in the fall significantly reduced the overwintering population, especially when combined with plowing of the stalks into the ground. More sophisticated trapping and monitoring devices were developed over the next decade. Further progress was made when the male boll weevil pheromone was identified in the 1960s; the insects could be lured into traps baited with this pheromone, further reducing their reproduction, and enhancing the monitoring system. The first full-scale eradication trial began in 1978 in southern Virginia and eastern North Carolina. After initial success, the USDA's APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) agency established an eradication plan. The cost of the program was borne both by APHIS (30%) and by the producer (70%). Since the weevil can travel long distances quickly, it was important to implement the program on a regional basis. Expansion of the program usually required cotton producers within the area of proposed expansion to pass a referendum with at least a two-thirds majority. Some states passed legislation to help growers pay their share of program costs. The program was extended into the southeast and southwest during the 1980s. Eradication is now complete in all cotton growing states except Texas, where problems along the Mexican border have halted the program there. Eradication was not complete in Texas as of 2012. Operation USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) provides technical support and limited Federal funds. The state departments of agriculture provide regulatory support, and USDA’s Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Services help in disseminating program information. Three main techniques are employed over a 3-5-year period: pheromone traps for detection, cultural practices to reduce the weevil’s food supply, and malathion treatments. During the first year, applications of malathion are made every five to seven days starting in late summer. The frequency is reduced to every 10 days during the later part of the growing season until the first frost. The cotton stalks are shredded and plowed into the ground to eliminate their use as a winter shelter. During years 2 through 5, the automatic spraying is supplemented by an intensive trapping program (one trap per 1–2 acres), and malathion applications are made only in those fields where weevils are detected. This phase begins in late spring and continues until the first killing frost. The final phase of the program involves monitoring and trapping at a density of one trap per , with spot spraying as required. The program has become more high-tech in recent years, employing GPS mapping technology and bar code readers that transmit trap data electronically. In portions of its range, the program has been bolstered by the spread of the red imported fire ant, which attacks the larvae and pupae of the boll weevil.US EPA - Cotton pesticide considerations Impacts At one time, cotton growers applied more than 41 percent of all insecticides in agricultural use; they regularly sprayed their cotton as many as 15 times a season. In contrast, under this program, only two applications are made by the third year, and this number may be reduced to nearly zero when the nationwide program is completed. The benefit-cost ratio is estimated by the USDA at 12:1, and the research that built the program will be used in other projects. The program may be used as a model for control of the sea lamprey infestation of the Great Lakes.Boll weevil eradication: a model for sea lamprey control? Journal of Great Lakes Research 2003 The ecological benefits of the program are manifold; in addition to reducing pesticide use in the US, the fumigation of exported U.S. cotton bales with methyl bromide has also been significantly reduced. Fewer pesticide applications enable other insects to survive, including those that naturally prey on the boll weevil.

Here, \\\\lambda is the thermal conductivity, \\\\rho is the density and c_\\\\text{p} is the specific heat capacity. The product of \\\\rho and c_\\\\text{p} is known as the volumetric heat capacity. A material's thermal effusivity is a measure of its ability to exchange thermal energy with its surroundings. If two semi-infinite bodies initially at temperatures T_1 and T_2 are brought in perfect thermal contact, the temperature at the contact surface T_m will be given by their relative effusivities. :T_m = T_1 + \\\\left(T_2 - T_1\\\\right)\\\\frac{e_2}{e_2 + e_1}=\\\\frac{e_1 T_1 + e_2 T_2}{e_1+e_2} This expression is valid for all times for semi-infinite bodies in perfect thermal contact. It is also a good first guess for the initial contact temperature for finite bodies. Direct measurement of thermal effusivity may be performed using specialty sensors, as pictured.  Thermal Effusivity vs Thermal Effusance  \\"Thermal effusance\\", is a newly coined term as a result of some discussions within ASTM where a specific researcher from the UK has determined that he does not accept the common term thermal effusivity and has invented his own term \\"thermal effusance\\". He distinguishes the difference as follows: \\"A materials thermal effusivity is a measure of its ability to exchange thermal energy with its surroundings. Although the quantity of thermal effusivity can be expressed in bulk property terms of e = √k∙ρ∙Cρ when measured, it is not measured in terms of bulk properties.\\" Given the logic of this argument, the same could be said for other heat transfer properties such as thermal conductivity. The distinction is addressed in understanding that in measuring non-solid bulk material the values are typically described as \\"effective\\" thermal effusivity and \\"effective\\" thermal conductivity.  Applications  One application of thermal effusivity is the quasi-qualitative measurement of coolness or warmth feel of materials on textiles and fabrics. When a textile or fabric is measured from the surface with short test times by any transient method or instrument, the measured effusivity includes various heat transfer mechanisms, including conductivity, convection and radiation, as well as contact resistance between the sensor and sample.

Life and career  Robert Polidori was born in 1951 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to a French-Canadian mother and a Corsican father. At age 9, Polidori’s family moved to the United States where his father worked as an engineer at Air Force bases and NASA installations. He grew up in Seattle, southern California, New Orleans, and Cocoa Beach, and first attended university in Florida in 1969.Siemens, Von Jochen. \\"When buildings start to tell a story.Fotografic Portfolio #41, 2010, pp. 4-8. Print. During his freshman year Polidori saw Michael Snow's film Wavelength (1967 film) and, inspired to study filmmaking, moved to New York City. The following year, he was hired by the legendary Jonas Mekas and worked as the theatre manager of the Anthology Film Archives.\\"Gallery Artists: Robert Polidori.\\" Edwynn Houk Gallery. Web. During this time, Polidori worked on four experimental films, exhibited in 1975 at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 1980 he graduated with a Masters of Arts in film from State University of New York (Buffalo). Polidori became interested in still photography while editing film frame-by- frame.

Web. In 1983 he moved to Paris and, interested in how empty spaces revealed history, began to document the restoration of Château de Versailles as a symbol of \\"society’s superego\\". In the late 1990s Polidori was engaged by The New Yorker to photograph Havana’s decaying architectural heritage and joined the magazine as a staff photographer in 1998.Polidori, Robert. Havana. Steidl, 2001. Print. Images from his Cuban series were later published in Havana (2001) by Steidl Verlag. Also interested in inner-city habitats or \\"auto-constructed\\" growth, Polidori recorded the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, urban sprawl of Brasilia, construction boom in Dubai, and slums of Mumbai. In May 2001, he photographed the closed Chernobyl nuclear power plant and nearby ghost town of Pripyat, Ukraine, and these images were later published as Zones of Exclusion – Pripyat and Chernobyl (2003).Polidori, Robert. Zones of Exclusion – Pripyat and Chernobyl. Steidl, 2003. Print. In 2002 Polidori was commissioned to photograph Detroit's Michigan Central Station for Metropolis (architecture magazine). Described by editor Martin C. Pedersen as \\"a keen observer of the built world\\", the magazine later published his urban images as Robert Polidori's Metropolis (2005).Pedersen, Martin C. \\"Robert Polidari's Metropolis.\\" Robert Polidori's Metropolis, 2004, p5. Print. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Polidori photographed the damaged homes and buildings of New Orleans, and documented the city's early restoration in 2006. Published as After the Flood (2006) by Steidl Verlag, many of these images were also exhibited at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art as \\"New Orleans after the Flood\\", a popular and well-attended exhibition.Updike, John. \\"After Katrina.\\" The New York Review of Books, 30 Nov. 2006. Web. Exhibitions of After the Flood were also mounted in London, Venice, and Toronto, as well as in New Orleans. During this time, Polidori continued to document the restoration of Château de Versailles and these photographs, published in the three-volume Parcour Muséologique Revisité (2009), were included in his retrospective exhibition at the Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal. Polidori returned to Beirut in 2010 where he photographed the damaged rooms of the famous Hotel Petra, abandoned during Lebanon’s civil war. The following year, he traveled to Paris to photograph the stored art collection of Yves Saint Laurent (designer),\\"An interview with Robert Polidori.\\" The Ground, #02, 2 Nov. 2012. Web. and to Venice to photograph the fashion label Bottega Veneta's fall 2011 campaign at the Palazzo Papadopoli.\\"The Collaborations: Robert Polidori.\\" Bottega Veneta. Web. From 2011 to 2015 Polidori also revisited and rephotographed Rio as well as Mumbai, including Dharavi's industrial street facade in a series of tracking shots. Exhibited as composite panoramic murals at Paul Kasmin Gallery (New York) in September 2016, these images were also published in the accompanying volume 60 Feet Road by Steidl Verlag. Since 2015, Polidori and his family live in Ojai, California.  Equipment and Approach  Polidori takes photographs with a large-format analog (photographic film) view-camera using 5x7, 8x10, or 11x14 inch color sheet negatives although, at times, uses a medium-format camera. Shot in natural light with up to 5-minute exposures, his images are described as \\"almost forensic\\" in detail. His work includes meticulously framed single images, and multiple images of tracking shots, which are scanned and composited later by digital means. Polidori describes his photographic approach as inquisitive: \\"When you point a camera at something, it is like asking a question. But the picture that emerges is like an answer.\\" He also noted the paradox of photographic labor, \\"to deliver up to some surface an epitome of something that occurred as an instant in the continuum of time, and to somehow how have it represent all of time.\\" Interested in creating commemorative images which serve memory or history, some series like \\"Havana\\" include portraiture,\\"Jonas Mekas / Robert Polidori: Portraits.\\" Edwynn Houk Gallery. 2012. Web. while others like the Chernobyl Zones of Exclusion or New Orleans After the Flood, although representative of their inhabitants, are devoid of people. In a review of the 2006 \\"New Orleans after the Flood\\" exhibition, John Updike described his approach: \\"Polidori, his work makes clear, loves the grave, delicate, and poignant beauty of architecture when the distracting presence of human inhabitants is eliminated from photographs.\\" Noting the attendance of \\"more youthful African-Americans than usually make their way into the Met,\\" he concluded: \\"It is for our children and our grandchildren—for the historical record... This is what it looked like; this is what we don’t want to happen again.\\" This approach was debated within art blogs and criticized for contextual loss when one image was used in a Brazilian non-profit, anti- smoking campaign.\\"Polidori and people pictures.\\" Alec Soth's Archived Blog, 7 Jan. 2007.

At the time of his 2016 New York exhibition, Polidori commented: \\"Personally I am more attracted to photographs that attempt to be more objective and 'emblematic' of a subject’s qualities rather than a personal subjective interpretation of phenomena.\\"  Recognition and Contribution  The subject of Fotografic Portfolio Edition #41, art director Tom Jacobi described Polidori as \\"a master of spatial aesthetics,Jacobi, Tom. \\"Introduction.\\" Fotografic Portfolio #41, 2010, p. 1. Print. while writer Von Jochen Siemens called him a \\"cultural detective for places with a story to tell\\". In a Domus Italiano review, Beatrice Zamponi wrote, he \\"trains his lens on the ruins of recent times, on dilapidated surroundings infused with profound aestheticism, turning them into a subtle instrument of social investigation.\\" At the time of Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal retrospective, curator Paulette Gagnon commented on the beauty of Polidori's photographs, \\"the subtle colours and perfect harmony of line and material seem to endow the image with some of the power and appeal of paintings,\\" as well as their power: \\"Concerned above all with the human condition, he explains situations – often crisis or disaster – that brings us back to life's essentials and shatter our complacency.\\" Described in The Wall Street Journal, as \\"meditations on the concepts of transience and decay, the cracked and peeling walls revealing layers of history,\\" Stephen Wallis concluded: \\"Polidori has never been purely a documentarian. His interest has always lain in making 'psychological portraits' of architectural spaces, which he sees as vessels for memories and as projections of the people who have lived there.\\" At the time of the 2006 Metropolitan Museum's exhibition New Orleans after the Flood, New York Times journalist Michael Kimmelman noted that Polidori's images \\"also express an archaeologist’s aspiration to document plain-spoken truth, and they are without most of the tricks of the trade that photographers exploit to turn victims into objects and pictures of pain into tributes to themselves.\\"Kimmelman, Michael. \\"What’s Wrong With This Picture?\\" The New York Times, 22 Sep. 2006. Web. In The New York Review of Books, author John Updike wrote, \\"it is the wrecked, mildewed interiors that take our eye and quicken our anxiety.... If the discomfort that After the Flood and Aftermath arouse contains an increment of discomfort at the poshness of the volumes and the aura of glamorous selflessness bestowed upon the photographers and their photographic appropriations, the record is indeed enhanced, for posterity to consult, and to use in ways we cannot imagine.\\"  Exhibitions and Collections  Polidori's work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art: New Filmmakers Program (New York), the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal, Martin- Gropius-Bau museum (Berlin) and the Instituto Moreira Salles (São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro).

There are several such notions, according to the concept of differential algebra used. The intention is to include equations formed by means of differential operators, in which the coefficients are rational functions of the variables (e.g. the hypergeometric equation). Algebraic differential equations are widely used in computer algebra and number theory. A simple concept is that of a polynomial vector field, in other words a vector field expressed with respect to a standard co-ordinate basis as the first partial derivatives with polynomial coefficients. This is a type of first-order algebraic differential operator. Formulations *Derivations D can be used as algebraic analogues of the formal part of differential calculus, so that algebraic differential equations make sense in commutative rings. *The theory of differential fields was set up to express differential Galois theory in algebraic terms. *The Weyl algebra W of differential operators with polynomial coefficients can be considered; certain modules M can be used to express differential equations, according to the presentation of M. *The concept of Koszul connection is something that transcribes easily into algebraic geometry, giving an algebraic analogue of the way systems of differential equations are geometrically represented by vector bundles with connections. *The concept of jet can be described in purely algebraic terms, as was done in part of Grothendieck's EGA project. *The theory of D-modules is a global theory of linear differential equations, and has been developed to include substantive results in the algebraic theory (including a Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for higher dimensions). Algebraic solutions It is usually not the case that the general solution of an algebraic differential equation is an algebraic function: solving equations typically produces novel transcendental functions. The case of algebraic solutions is however of considerable interest; the classical Schwarz list deals with the case of the hypergeometric equation. In differential Galois theory the case of algebraic solutions is that in which the differential Galois group G is finite (equivalently, of dimension 0, or of a finite monodromy group for the case of Riemann surfaces and linear equations). This case stands in relation with the whole theory roughly as invariant theory does to group representation theory. The group G is in general difficult to compute, the understanding of algebraic solutions is an indication of upper bounds for G.

Alexandre Chatrian (18 December 1826 – 3 September 1890) was a French writer, associated with the region of Alsace-Lorraine. Almost all of his works were written jointly with Émile Erckmann under the name Erckmann-Chatrian. Life =Youth= He was born at Abreschviller (Moselle), in the locality known as le Grand Soldat (or Soldatenthal in German). From 1842 he studied in Phalsbourg (German Pfalzburg). During 1843 his father's glassworks went bankrupt, and the next year he went to Belgium for two years to earn a living as an accountant, after which he returned to Phalsbourg as a teacher. He met Erckmann in 1847, and they became friends, spending the summer in the Vosges. While staying at Paris, Erckmann witnessed the Revolution of 1848: inspired, they founded a political club at Phalsbourg and a short-lived newsletter at Strasbourg. Their politics were republican and nationalist. At the start of the 1850s they began publishing in Le Démocrate du Rhin, expecting quick success, but after several years they became disillusioned. A play performed at Strasbourg in 1850, L'Alsace en 1814, was banned after just two performances. When he lost his teaching post, Erckmann persuaded him to move to Paris, where in 1852 he took a job as rail administrator the Compagnie des chemins de fer de l'Est. =Success= Recognition came in 1859 and they became well known as fantasy writers under the pseudonym of Émile Erckmann-Chatrian. They moved together to Paris, where they lived close to the east railway station and returned frequently to Lorraine. In 1868 the publisher Hetzel bought exclusive rights to their work, and in May 1869 Chatrian purchased a property at Raincy. He began a relationship with Adélaïde Riberon, by whom he would have two sons. His father, Jean-Baptiste, died on 13 July 1870. He married Riberon in February 1871. During August 1870, Erckmann was at Phalsbourg at the time of Mac-Mahon's defeat. With the Franco-Prussian War, the works of the two lorrains gained a popularity which was closely related to nationalistic desires for revenge and nostalgia for the \\"blue line of the Vosges.\\" From 1872, Erckmann spent most of his time on the novels while Chatrian busied himself with their plays: it is likely that the joint pseudonym was now appearing on works that were no longer jointly written. In September, Erckmann moved into a house at Saint-Dié, and the following year he went on a tour of the eastern Mediterranean. Political entanglements started to make life difficult for the two ardent republicans. In 1880 a play by Chatrian, Alsace ou les fiancés d’Alsace, was banned by a republican minister. =Later years= In 1884 Chatrian retired from his position at the railway company and moved to Villemomble; the next year, his play Myrtille failed and he moved again to Saint-Dié. From this point on, his mental health began to deteriorate. The last work signed Erckmann-Chatrian was L’Art et les grands idéalistes (1885). In 1886 Erckmann refused to sign a new contract that had been negotiated by Chatrian with their publisher, Hetzel. On 13 March 1887, Chatrian, at this time battling mental illness, wrote to Erckmann that he was paying ghost-writers out of their common royalties. This was the end of their association and their friendship. On 19 August 1889, the former secretary of Chatrian published an article in Le Figaro attacking Erckmann, who responded with a lawsuit. At about this time, the desperately ill Chatrian lost his reason entirely. Erckmann's visa expired; no longer allowed to reside in his home town, he moved to Lunéville. Chatrian died on 3 September 1890 at Villemomble.

The company flourished as new uses were found for all sorts of seeds. It was helped by the contemporary popularity for keeping caged birds, particularly canaries. At the beginning of the 19th century, the landscape around the Zaan river was dominated by merchants’ houses, their warehouses and, most distinctively, their windmills. In the pre-industrial age, the windmills functioned as sophisticated processing plants, using wind power to crush, grind and mix all manner of ingredients. Wessanen was by the start of the 20th century a large company, and following the award of royal warrants it was now known as NV Wessanen Koninklijke Fabrieken (royal factories). With a diversified global sales market, it was able to survive war, tariff barriers and the demise of colonialism. But it was still a typically Dutch company, with production facilities on the Zaan River.  Activities  Wessanen works with organic or natural food In Europe Wessanen is, next to the Netherlands (Wessanen Benelux, Natudis, Foodprints, Kroon Biologische Verswaren), active in Belgium (Hagor-Bioservice), Germany (Allos Hof-Manufaktur GmbH, Allos GmbH, Allos Schwarzwald GmbH), France (Bjorg Bonneterre et Compagnie), the United Kingdom (Kallo Foods, Clipper tea) and Italy (Bio Slym, Abafoods).

Operated by Handmade Mobile Entertainment, Flirtomatic was named the number one mobile dating site in the U.S. in a study by the mobile measurement company Ground Truth. Flirtomatic allows members to connect on the basis of preferences, interests, location and other information stored in their profile; chat with other users; send immediate messages with graphics and photos; rate other members; and find user-generated editorial content relating to flirting and dating. Flirtomatic has virtual currency known as FlirtPoints, which members can purchase and use to buy additional services, such as virtual goods, and pay to promote or advertise their profile within the service and through alert features. About 80 percent of its members access Flirtomatic via mobile phone. Flirtomatic is available to mobile users in Britain, Germany, Australia, Spain, Italy and the United States. The service is available on iPhone, Android, BlackBerry and Ovi and has integrated Facebook into its services. Flirtomatic has partnerships with AT&T;, Verizon, Virgin Mobile, Cricket, Vodafone, T-Mobile, Orange, MetroPCS and ninemsn and has attracted mobile advertising from companies such as Fiat, Peugeot, NatWest, O2, Vodafone, Rimmel, Samsung, Walkers, Orange, 3, McDonald's, H&M; and Sony Pictures. The service, open to users 18 and older, has 3.5 million (1.5 million in the U.S.) registered users. Flirtomatic users average six logins a day while its iPhone users check in nine times a day. The company generates revenues from online advertising and value-added services paid for through carrier billing, premium SMS and card payments. Flirtomatic monitors its site in order to maintain a PG-rated content. History Flirtomatic was founded by Avi Azulai and Mark Curtis in 2005. Azulai, the company chairman, previously founded iTouch, the London Stock Exchange-listed mobile entertainment business sold for £180 million ($284 million) in June 2005. Mark Curtis, the former CEO, left the company in July 2011 when Neil Goldberg took over the CEO role. Fjord created and developed the flirting theme, invented the service's name and was instrumental in the design of all digital interfaces. The company also developed such features as Flirtograms and Supersnogs. The service started as a Fjord concept when Nokia enlisted the company to propose five ideas for mobile, one of which became Flirtomatic. \\"When we described dating on the mobile and what it’d feel like, we talked about messaging, fun, humor, a light touch,\\" Curtis said to WeLoveBusiness.co.uk. \\"Some bright spark piped up and said, ‘We’re describing flirting’ to which the rest of us thought, ‘Wow! There’s an idea. How could we create an application that could make flirting as easy, fun and good as it possibly can be for mobile?’ \\" Fjord took a lead role in securing funding to build and launch Flirtomatic, which is now independently run. Flirtomatic’s proprietary multimedia interaction platform was designed to provide a consumer entertainment proposition that stood between the popular social networking and online dating services. The company’s emphasis on flirting has differentiated it from more traditional online dating sites geared toward matching users with one another. Flirtomatic had 100,000 users in July 2006, with a Flirtomatic poll revealing that online flirting peaks daily at 4:30 p.m. \\"due to workers trying to waste that last hour before the end of their working day,\\" according to MediaWeek. By November 2006, Flirtomatic had 185,000 registered users. The following year, Flirtomatic adopted a \\"freemium\\" model, switching from subscriptions for mobile to mobile advertising revenues and premium services. Flirtomatic reached 1 million users and had a 475 percent revenue increase in 2008. The company also expanded into Germany that year and into Australia in 2009. In 2008, flirtomatic violated the British flirtbox trademark by naming its chat window \\"flirtbox\\". When flirtomatic tried to enter the German market and cooperated with the German broadcaster Prosieben, also the German flirtbox trademark was violated as the on-air trailers showed the flirtbox phrases on TV. In Dec. 2009, Flirtomatic ranked 9th in mobile Internet use in the UK, at 55 million minutes for the month, according to GSMA Mobile Media Metrics. Flirtomatic sold 100,000 virtual gifts in the four weeks leading up to Christmas of that year, including 19,455 Christmas stockings. Flirtomatic launched an advertising-funded iPhone application in January 2010, which was made available for free via the Apple Inc. App Store. Later that year, Flirtomatic was made available on Android, BlackBerry and Ovi and integrated Facebook into its services. Flirtomatic also expanded into Spain and Italy. In April 2010, Mobile Commerce, which delivers 25 percent of all mobile Internet searches from UK carrier portals, released a report that found that Flirtomatic was the 15th most commonly searched term on the UK mobile web in 2009. During the 2010 election for UK prime minister, Flirtomatic posted mock profiles of the three main candidates and invited members to \\"snog\\" them. By May 5, 2010, 10,000 Flirtomatic users weighed in: 34.4 percent chose Liberal Democrat candidate Nick Clegg, 33.9 percent picked Conservative candidate David Cameron and 31.7 percent selected Labour candidate Gordon Brown. Flirtomatic raised $18 million in overall funding by December 2010, with $10 million secured that year. Among the investors: Nauta Capital, Doughty Hanson Technology Ventures, Seraphim Capital, Oxford Capital Partners and company chairman Avi Azulai. In 2011 Flirtomatic was re-designed as the original designs primarily targeted young people - but in order to generate revenue, especially older people were needed. Reception Flirtomatic in 2008 topped The Mediatech 100, a list of the hottest mediatech companies in Europe compiled by Library House, a Cambridge, UK, research firm. In September 2009, Flirtomatic was ranked #4 in the Guardian’s Tech Media Invest Top 100 companies. Flirtomatic ranked eighth in mobile downloads in the U.S. in March 2010 Flirtomatic was named the number one mobile dating site in the U.S. in August 2010, accounting for 65 percent of the summer audience for mobile dating, according to a study by the mobile measurement company Ground Truth. In a January 2011 poll of its contacts in the mobile content business, Mobile Entertainment named Mark Curtis one of the top 50 executives in the field. In 2014 Flirtomatic was silently switched off as no additional venture capital could be acquired. Flirtomatic had not managed to generate a revenue stream that made the business model independent from venture capital.

The practice has traditionally been associated with the Apostleship of Prayer. While since 1929 the Pope has added a general and a mission intention to the traditional morning offering prayer each month, Pope Francis has restored this to the original, single monthly intention. Over time other forms of the morning offering prayer have been suggested. History and theological basis The morning offering has been an old practice in the Church but it started to spread largely through the Apostleship of Prayer, started by Fr. Francis X. Gautrelet, S.J., and especially through the book written by another Jesuit, Fr. Henri Ramière, S.J., who in 1861 adapted the Apostleship of Prayer for parishes and various Catholic institutions, and made it known by his book \\"The Apostleship of Prayer\\" which has been translated into many languages. John Marie Vianney Historic roots of such a practice can be traced to those like Saint Mechtilde (1241-1298) who had visions of Jesus Christ and transmitted the following words of Jesus: \\"When you awake in the morning, let your first act be to salute My Heart, and to offer Me your own. ...Whoever shall breathe a sigh toward Me from the bottom of his heart when he awakes in the morning and shall ask Me to work all his works in him throughout the day, will draw Me to him. ...For never does a man breathe a sigh of longing aspiration toward Me without drawing Me nearer to him than I was before.\\" Saint John Mary Vianney has also said: \\"All that we do without offering it to God is wasted.\\" Catholic authors encourage repeating this offering throughout the day, especially at the start of one's professional work which takes a large part of each day. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states: :The Christian begins his day, his prayers, and his activities with the Sign of the Cross: \\"in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\\" The baptized person dedicates the day to the glory of God and calls on the Savior's grace which lets him act in the Spirit as a child of the Father.Catechism of the Catholic Church §2157 The other element in this theology is the actual work done with spirit of excellence in consonance with the intention of offering something \\"worthy\\" to the sanctity, majesty, and goodness of our God. This theology is also supported by private revelation. Sister Josefa Menéndez (1890-1923) reported that she heard Jesus Christ tell her: \\"When you awake, enter at once into My Heart, and when you are in it, offer My Father all your actions united to the pulsations of My Heart. ...If [a person is] engaged in work of no value in itself, if she bathes it in My Blood or unites it to the work I Myself did during My mortal life, it will greatly profit souls, ... more, perhaps, than if she had preached to the whole world.\\" Practice The Morning offering is meant to be prayed first thing in the morning, upon waking up. In its simplest form, a morning offering is nothing more than a brief prayer that recognizes the presence of God, and puts the day ahead in God's hands.\\"Make a Morning Offering\\", Campus Ministry, University of Notre Dame Many forms of this offering are proposed on the website of the Apostleship of Prayer. The traditional Morning offering to the Sacred Heart of Jesus was composed by French Jesuit Fr. François-Xavier Gautrelet in 1844. It reflects the Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary.Harter, Michael. Hearts on fire: praying with Jesuits, 2005 p. 13Socias, James. Handbook of Prayers 2006, p. 42 Traditional Morning Offering :O Jesus, through the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I offer you my prayers, works, joys, sufferings of this day, in union with the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass throughout the world. them for all the intentions of your Sacred Heart; the salvation of souls, the reparation for sin, the reunion of all Christians; I offer them for the intentions of our bishops and of all members of the Apostleship of Prayer, and in particular for the intention recommended by the Holy Father this month. Children's daily offering prayer :For love of me you came to earth; you gave your life for me. So every day you give me now. I give back happily. Take all my laughter, all my tears, each thought, each word, each deed. And let them be my all-day prayer, to help all those in need. St. Mechtilde revelation, with two other mystics :Dear Lord, I adore Thy Sacred Heart, which I desire to enter with acts of love, praise, adoration, and thanksgiving. I offer Thee my own heart as I sigh to Thee from its very depths, asking that Thou will worketh through me in all that I do this day; thus may I draw Thee closer to me than Thou wert before. I offer Thee all the crosses and sufferings of the world, in union with Thy life on earth, in expiation for sins. Please join my every action and heartbeat to the pulsations of Thy Heart. I unite all my works of this day to those labors Thou didst perform while Thou wert on earth, bathing them in Thy Precious Blood, and I offer them to the Heavenly Father so that many souls may be saved. Amen. A daily offering for pro-life activists :God, you know the desires of our hearts for authentic peace, justice, and love. I offer you my prayers, thoughts, words, actions, joys, and sufferings today, together with Jesus who continues to offer himself to us in the Eucharist; who continues to reveal himself to us in the poor, the oppressed, the marginalized, the unborn, the most vulnerable in our world. May your Holy Spirit be my guide and strength today so that I may be a witness to your love, your justice, and your peace, and to the sanctity of each human life. Together with Mary, our mother, sister, and friend, she who carried the Savior in her womb, with all the communion of saints, and with all of us who offer ourselves to you for the good of others today, we pray: Amen.

Its center, the Spieker center, in addition to being the incenter of the medial triangle, is the center of mass of the uniform-density boundary of triangle. The Spieker center is also the point where all three cleavers of the triangle (perimeter bisectors with an endpoint at a side's midpoint) intersect each other.  History  The Spieker circle and Spieker center are named after Theodor Spieker, a mathematician and professor from Potsdam, Germany. In 1862, he published Lehrbuch der ebenen geometrie mit übungsaufgaben für höhere lehranstalten, dealing with planar geometry. Due to this publication, influential in the lives of many famous scientists and mathematicians including Albert Einstein, Spieker became the mathematician for whom the Spieker circle and center were named.  Construction  To find the Spieker circle of a triangle, the medial triangle must first be constructed from the midpoints of each side of the original triangle. The circle is then constructed in such a way that each side of the medial triangle is tangent to the circle within the medial triangle, creating the incircle. This circle center is named the Spieker center.  Nagel points and lines  Spieker circles also have relations to Nagel points. The incenter of the triangle and the Nagel point form a line within the Spieker circle. The middle of this line segment is the Spieker center. The Nagel line is formed by the incenter of the triangle, the Nagel point, and the centroid of the triangle. The Spieker center will always lie on this line.  Nine-point circle and Euler line  Spieker circles were first found to be very similar to nine-point circles by Julian Coolidge. At this time, it was not yet identified as the Spieker circle, but is referred to as the \\"P circle\\" throughout the book. The nine- point circle with the Euler line and the Spieker circle with the Nagel line are analogous to each other, but are not duals, only having dual-like similarities. One similarity between the nine-point circle and the Spieker circle deals with their construction. The nine-point circle is the circumscribed circle of the medial triangle, while the Spieker circle is the inscribed circle of the medial triangle. With relation to their associated lines, the incenter for the Nagel line relates to the circumcenter for the Euler line. Another analogous point is the Nagel point and the othocenter, with the Nagel point associated with the Spieker circle and the orthocenter associated with the nine-point circle. Each circle meets the sides of the medial triangle where the lines from the orthocenter, or the Nagel point, to the vertices of the original triangle meet the sides of the medial triangle. = Spieker conic = The nine-point circle with the Euler line was generalized into the nine-point conic. Through a similar process, due to the analogous properties of the two circles, the Spieker circle was also able to be generalized into the Spieker conic. The Spieker conic is still found within the medial triangle and touches each side of the medial triangle, however it does not meet those sides of the triangle at the same points. If lines are constructed from each vertex of the medial triangle to the Nagel point, then the midpoint of each of those lines can be found. Also, the midpoints of each side of the medial triangle are found and connected to the midpoint of the opposite line through the Nagel point. Each of these lines share a common midpoint, S. With each of these lines reflected through S, the result is 6 points within the medial triangle. Draw a conic through any 5 of these reflected points and the conic will touch the final point. This was proven by de Villiers in 2006.  Spieker radical circle  The Spieker radical circle is the circle, centered at the Spieker center, which is orthogonal to the three excircles of the medial triangle.

Originally developed by Logic Works, erwin has since been acquired by a series of companies, before being spun-off by the private equity firm Parallax Capital Partners, which acquired and incorporated it as a separate entity, erwin, Inc., managed by CEO Adam Famularo. The software’s engine is based on the IDEF1X method, although it now also supports diagrams displayed with a variant information technology engineering notation, as well as a dimensional modeling notation.  History  ERwin was created by Logic Works, which was based in Princeton, New Jersey. In May 1993, Logic Works released ERwin/ERX, a version of the tool designed to work in conjunction with PowerBuilder. The database models created using ERwin could be translated into software built through the PowerBuilder integrated development environment (IDE). In May 1995, Logic Works ERwin was expanded to include several other IDEs, adding SQLWindows from Gupta Technologies and Visual Basic from Microsoft. As of 1996, ERwin was among several data modeling software solutions being used to facilitate a wide move to the client–server model in database management. In 1998, Logic Works was acquired by Platinum Technology which was later acquired, in May 1999, by Computer Associates (CA). ERwin was initially made part of CA’s Jasmine suite but it was later added to their new AllFusion suite under the name AllFusion ERwin Data Modeler. The tool was later renamed to CA ERwin Data Modeler. In 2014 Embarcadero Technologies sought to acquire the product from CA, Inc. This acquisition was blocked by the Department of Justice over anti-competitive concerns. In April 2016, Parallax Capital Partners, a private equity firm, acquired the software from CA Technologies and appointed Adam Famularo as CEO. The company now operates under a new name stylized as erwin, Inc. In September 2016, erwin announced that it had acquired Corso, a British enterprise architecture service provider. In December of the same year, erwin acquired the business process modeling software Casewise, with a plan to integrate the two. In 2017, erwin released its Data Modeler NoSQL, an enterprise-class data modeling solution for MongoDB. In April 2018, NoSQL data modeling support for Couchbase was added. Also that year, erwin launched a data governance solution with impact analysis and integrations to its business process, enterprise architecture and data modeling suites. In January 2018, the company acquired data harvesting technology and data governance consulting services company A&P; Consulting. They also developed the erwin EDGE software platform, with EDGE as an acronym for “enterprise data governance experience”, intending to use data governance for data-driven insights to help accomplish organizational objectives. In February 2018 erwin released its first State of Data Governance Report with UBM. In August 2018, erwin acquired metadata management and data governance company AnalytiX DS.  Overview  At its core, erwin has a computer-aided software engineering tool (or CASE tool). Users can utilize erwin Data Modeler as a way to take conceptual data model and create a logical data model that is not dependent on a specific database technology. This schematic model can be used to create the physical data model. Users can then forward engineer the data definition language required to instantiate the schema for a range of database-management systems. The software includes features to graphically modify the model, including dialog boxes for specifying the number of entity–relationships, database constraints, indexes, and data uniqueness. erwin supports three data modeling languages: IDEF1X, a variant of information technology engineering developed by James Martin, and a form of dimensional modeling notation. The software also allows users to generate data models by reverse-engineering pre-existing databases that are based on several different formats. Another included feature is erwin’s ability to create reusable design standards: “including naming standards, data type standards, model templates and more.” The software includes several features for modifying how the data model is displayed, including options for several colors, fonts, diagrams, subject areas and layouts. erwin’s Complete Compare feature allows the user to compare two versions of a model, displays differences, and allows for merging and updates in either direction. As of March 2016, the software bundle also includes its own Report Designer. The erwin DM 2018 update included Netezza, MySQL 8.x, PostgreSQL 10.4, and Hive; model counts reports; and PII support. The 2019 update included DB2 z/OS v12, SQL Server 2017, Teradata v16.20, and PostgreSQL 11.2, in addition to reporting enhancements like user-defined properties and filters.  Notable users  Beginning in 1992, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) was one of the larger organizations to utilize ERwin to integrate its many independent databases located at its 120 field offices. UNDP used ERwin to develop a “corporate data model”, with the goal of “reducing redundant data entry” and create a single database framework based on which “all future systems can be designed”. ERwin was used to both reverse-engineer existing data at field offices and also move data from Computer Associates’ IDMS to Sybase’s UnixRDBMS. As of 2001, the insurance company Aetna used Erwin Data Modeler to automate maintenance of its database table definitions. Aetna’s database consisted of 15,000 table definitions which became difficult to maintain manually. As of 2002, ERwin was among the products used by the New York Power Authority. The software was also in use by Utah State Office of Education as of 2006.

She was one of the eight Great Royal Wives of Pharaoh Ramesses II of the 19th Dynasty of Egypt. Life She is supposedly the third and youngest child of Seti I and Tuya, and the younger sister of Ramesses II and Tia. This theory is based on a statue of Queen Tuya, now in the Vatican. The statue shows Tuya with Henutmire, thus it is assumed that they were mother and daughter. However, she is nowhere mentioned as \\"King's Sister\\", a title which Princess Tia used, thus it is unclear whether she was a younger sister or a daughter of Ramesses.Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson (2004), p.164 Her name means \\"The lady is like Rê\\". She married Ramesses II and became Great Royal Wife; if she was his daughter, she was the fourth to do so, after Bintanath, Meritamen and Nebettawy. She is shown on statues of Ramesses from Abukir and Heliopolis.Dodson & Hilton, p.170 On a colossus from Hermopolis she is depicted together with Princess-Queen Bintanath. Both have the titles The Hereditary Princess, richly favoured, Mistress of the South and the North, King's Daughter, Great Royal Wife.Kitchen, K.A., Ramesside Inscriptions, Translated & Annotated, Translations, Volume II, Blackwell Publishers, 1996. Death and burial She died around Ramesses' 40th regnal year, and was buried in the tomb QV75. Her tomb was robbed already in antiquity; the trough of her coffin was later used for the burial of priest-king Harsiese in Medinet Habu.

The organization helps formulate ocean policy at the federal and state government levels based on peer reviewed science. About Ocean Conservancy was founded in 1972, as the Delta Corporation to promote healthy and diverse ocean ecosystems, and to oppose practices that threaten oceanic and human life. Through several program areas, Ocean Conservancy advocates for protecting of special marine habitats, restoring sustainable fisheries, reducing the human impact on ocean ecosystems and managing U.S. ocean resources. Ocean Conservancy is a tax-exempt not-for-profit organization. It meets the Better Business Bureau's 20 Standards for Charity Accountability. History Ocean Conservancy was founded in 1972, with goals to promote healthy and diverse ocean ecosystems, and to oppose practices that threaten oceanic and human life. The Conservancy's list of priorities include \\"Restore Sustainable American Fisheries,\\" \\"Protect Wildlife From Human Impacts,\\" \\"Conserve Special Ocean Places,\\" and \\"Reform Government for Better Ocean Stewardship.\\" It started with goals to promote healthy and safe ocean ecosystems and to help prevent things that threaten oceanic and human life. The conservancy's main concern was to restore sustainable American fisheries and protect wildlife from human impact. Previous names * Delta Corporation (1972 to mid-1970s) * Center for Environmental Education (mid-1970s to 1989) * Center for Marine Conservation (1989–2001) * Ocean Conservancy (2001–Present) Accomplishments =Fisheries= After a four-year advocacy effort, Ocean Conservancy helped enact a Congressional rewrite of the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 1996,[A New Course For America’s Fish and Fishermen: A Review of the Magnuson Stevens Reauthorization Act of 2006 and the Challenges Ahead.\\" Marine Fish Conservation Network (MFCN) Website. MFCN. September 2007. Web. Pg. 3. 2 November 2010 Sustainable Development 16, Dec. 2008] which changed the way fisheries are managed. It remains the nation's primary fisheries law.[ 16 U.S.C. §§ 1801–1884] Prior to 1996 the law contained no provisions to stop overfishing or require the rebuilding of fish stocks.[\\"Implementing Annual Catch Limits: A Blueprint for Ending Overfishing in U.S. Fisheries.\\" Marine Fish Conservation Network (MFCN) Website. MFCN, April 2009. Web. Pg. 3. 2 November 2010] There was no prohibition of bycatch, when fish and animals are caught unintentionally by fishing gear or nets targeting specific species. Nor was there a directive to protect fish habitat. Ocean Conservancy lobbied successfully to close these loopholes and establish more sustainable fishing practices. =Marine mammals= Ocean Conservancy aims to protect marine mammals and their habitat. In 1979, the organization established the Seal Rescue Fund (SRF) to protect marine mammals from commercial exploitation. Its efforts to ban whaling resulted in the International Whaling Commission adopting an international moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982. In 1984, Ocean Conservancy led efforts against U.S.-sanctioned fur seal hunt by blocking renewal of the North Pacific Fur Seal Treaty in the Pribilof Islands, as well as efforts to protect dolphins from the tuna industry.[ \\"North Pacific Fur Seal Treaty of 1911\\". National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.] Ocean Conservancy was also assisted in the creation of the dolphin-safe tuna-labeling program. =Sea turtles= Ocean Conservancy's effort for sea turtles, which resulted in the requirement for turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in shrimp trawl gear, saves thousands of turtles each year.[ Lee, Scott (1999) (PDF). Ancient Sea Turtles: Stranded in a Modern World. USA: Sea Turtle Restoration Project.] Ocean Conservancy's Sea Turtle Rescue Fund appealed directly to shrimpers to voluntarily address the problem of sea turtles drowning in their nets. Ocean Conservancy played a major role in derailing proposals to reopen international trade in sea turtle products and in ending Japanese imports of Hawksbill sea turtle shells.[ Anne B. Meylan and Marydel Donnelly, \\"Status Justification for Listing the Hawksbill Turtle as Critically Endangered on the 1996 IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals,\\" Chelonian Conservation and Biology, April 1999, vol. 3, no. 2, p. 203] =Coral reef protection and Marine Sanctuaries programs= Ocean Conservancy is attempting to restore coral reefs through coral tree nurseries and research as part of the Recovery Plan with the NOAA. The coral are very sensitive to changes in water temperature and quality caused by global warming, and many times these changes result in disease and death of the reef. The Ocean Conservancy informs the public of the problems plaguing reefs as well as other marine ecosystems through their website and a magazine that they publish. They also have a staff of senior scientists and policy experts who travel to Capitol Hill to share their expertise and to urge policymakers to encourage the implementation of policies regarding the mitigation, adaptation, and alternatives to damaging activities such as the use of carbon-based fuels.[ \\"Oceans in peril World's seas face myriad threats\\" Daytona Beach Daily Journal, 8 June 2009] = International Coastal Cleanup = Group of volunteers participating in an ocean clean up run by Ocean Conservancy. One of the Ocean Conservancy's concerns involves setting up ocean cleanups, an event where volunteers can gather to remove trash from their local oceans. Their main event is the International Coastal Cleanup, a day where over 150 countries gather to clean up beaches and oceans. The movement was created by Linda Maraniss and Kathy O'Hara in 1986 when they organized the Ocean Conservancy's first local cleanup event. Since this first cleanup, Ocean Conservancy has helped to pick up over 300 million pounds of trash from the ocean. Scientists have confirmed that about 8 million metric tons of plastic are added to oceans every year, prompting the International Coastal Cleanup to take place and expand every year. In order to easily track the trash being picked up, Ocean Conservancy launched an app called Clean Swell in 2015. The user is allowed to log and photograph the trash they pick up and the information is then sent to the Ocean Conservancy's global trash database. Criticisms * The Gloucester Times expressed concern that Ocean Conservancy worked too closely with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on policies that weaken the fishing industry. * In 2012, a representative for Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal said that clean-up proposals in response to the 2010 BP oil spill, outlined in a report sponsored by the Ocean Conservancy, as well as Environmental Defense Fund, the National Audubon Society, the Nature Conservancy, Oxfam and the National Wildlife Federation, were \\"out of touch\\". *In 2015, a group of over 200 environmental leaders and organizations sent an open letter and a technical critique of Ocean Conservancy's \\"Stemming the Tide\\" report, also released in 2015. The criticism centered on Ocean Conservancy's advocacy for incineration, which the letter writes can cause harmful effects, the damaging cost waste would have on the Asian cities that the report proposed store waste nearby, and the acceptance of the necessity of plastics.

Established in 1993, it is now listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. HomeServe operates in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, France, Spain and Japan. History The company was originally established by Richard Harpin in 1993 as a joint venture between South Staffordshire Water and himself under the name of Fastfix to offer an emergency plumbing service. In 1994, the company diversified offering plumbing and drainage policies under the name \\"HomeServiceScheme\\". It launched Doméo, a joint venture in France in 2001, and Home Service in the United States in 2003. Attempts to launch in Australia failed, after objections were raised in the Australian Parliament. The water business was demerged from the rest of the Group in 2004 and the name of the company was changed to HomeServe PLC. The Company bought property repair company Reparalia in Spain in 2007, the French warranty provider SFG in 2009HomeServe buys France's SFG Yorkshire Post, 26 May 2009 and National Grid's service contract business in the United States in 2010. In 2010, HomeServe launched Assitenza Casa in Italy, however in March 2017 they sold 51% of this business to Edison, and the remaining 49% in July 2019. In 2012, HomeServe launched in Germany, but the venture was unsuccessful and was sold in 2015. In a list of the \\"best places to work in the UK\\" published by Glassdoor in 2016, HomeServe was placed third, being an entry in the list for the first time. HomeServe's North American business has made a series of acquisitions, including Utility Service Partners in 2016, Dominion Products and Services in 2017, and in 2019 ServLine and a 79% stake in eLocal. 2019 saw the profit from the US business overtake that of the UK. In 2017, HomeServe announced the acquisition of 40% of Checkatrade, an online directory of customer recommended tradespeople and took complete ownership later that year. Simultaneously, the Company took a 70% stake in Habitissimo, a Spanish web platform that connects homeowners to tradespeople and purchased the remaining 30% in 2019. In 2018, UK recruitment website Indeed, named Homeserve as the UK's fourth best private sector employer based on millions of employee ratings and reviews. In 2019, HomeServe expanded into Japan with a joint venture with the Mitsubishi Corporation. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, HomeServe offered free emergency repairs to NHS and social care workers in the UK and introduced a telephone-based repair advice service in the US. Sports Sponsorship In 2010, HomeServe signed a one-year, £750,000 deal to be the official sponsor of then Premier League club West Bromwich Albion F.C. for the 2010/11 season. The club had previously sponsored a stand at West Bromwich Albion's neighbouring clubs, Walsall F.C. In 2014, HomeServe signed a three- year deal to sponsor the Main Stand at Walsall F.C.'s Bescot Stadium. Later in 2014, it was announced that HomeServe would be the official kit sponsor of Walsall F.C. in a three-year deal. In 2017, HomeServe signed a five-year deal with Walsall F.C.  Criticism  During the period 2008 to 2011 the UK business breached the Financial Conduct Authority's Principles of Business, in particular mis-selling of policies to customers. As a result, HomeServe suspended all UK sales activity between October 2011 and January 2012 for retraining sales staff and was fined £30,647,400 by the FCA in 2014. Throughout this period, three private equity groups looked to acquire the company but were rejected by HomeServe's board. In April 2012, Ofcom imposed a fine of £750,000 for making silent and abandoned calls to prospective customers in the period February to March 2011. It has since ceased the practice of cold-calling customers.

According to the director, the film is inspired by the 1961 Blake Edwards film, Breakfast at Tiffany's.  Plot  Jean (Gad Elmaleh) is a waiter/barman at a luxury hotel. Irène (Audrey Tautou), is a gold digger who convinces wealthy men to fund her lavish lifestyle in exchange for companionship and sex. When Irène's elderly lover gets drunk and falls asleep on her birthday, she goes to the hotel bar, where she assumes the barman is absent and Jean is a millionaire guest. Rather than correcting her, he makes her several impressive cocktails and they then retire, tipsy, to the hotel's Imperial suite where they spend the night together. In the morning, Jean awakens to find Irène has gone. A year later, Irène returns to the hotel with Jacques, who asks her to marry him. Irène is surprised to see Jean, and he manages to conceal his occupation from her again. Jean and Irène sleep together again, but Jacques sees them and breaks off the engagement. Irène goes to Jean, pretending she gave up Jacques to be with him, but as they lie in bed together, they are discovered by guests and staff in the Imperial suite. When Irène discovers who Jean really is, she walks out. However, Jean is now in love and follows her, finding her at the Côte d'Azur. Pursuing her, he spends all the money to his name to pay for her presence, including his savings and pension plan, until he uses his final euro for \\"10 more seconds\\" to look into her eyes. Irène leaves him for another rich man, and Jean is left with a hotel bill he cannot pay. Luckily, Jean is picked up by a wealthy widow, Madeleine, who pays his bills in exchange for his companionship. Irène bumps into him again with another lover, Gilles. She is a little jealous, but now that they are \\"equals\\", she teaches Jean the tricks of gold-digging. Using her advice, he soon wheedles a €30,000 watch from Madeleine, after she forced him to have plastic surgery on his ear. On a shopping spree, Irène meets up with Jean and coyly offers him the euro for \\"10 more seconds\\". Jean continues to prove himself a skillful gold digger. He and Irène steal away from their patrons every chance they can, falling in love in the process. On the morning of Irène's departure for Venice, Gilles catches Irène and Jean kissing on the hotel room balcony. Furious, Gilles leaves Irène at the hotel with nothing but a sarong and the swimsuit she is wearing. Jean sells his watch to buy Irène a week's stay in their hotel and a gorgeous evening gown. He also gives her an invitation to a party. Madeleine is at first upset with Jean for selling his watch, but Jean calms her down by giving her a pair of earrings. He claims that he pawned the watch to buy Madeleine a gift and she is pleased. At the party that evening, Irène sees Jacques again, but with a new young girlfriend, Agnès. Whilst stealing a dance with Jean, Irène hatches a plan to win Jacques back again, with Jean's assistance. Jean agrees to play along and is dumped by Madeleine in the process. However, he convinces Agnès that he is a prince and seduces her away from Jacques, giving Irène a chance to steal Jacques. However, when Irène sees Jean with Agnès on the balcony, she realizes she loves Jean. She runs away from Jacques and declares her love, abandoning her pursuit of a luxurious lifestyle. The movie ends with barefoot Irène and Jean riding off to Italy on his scooter, using the euro coin for the toll fee.  Cast  * Audrey Tautou as Irène Mercier * Gad Elmaleh as Jean Simon * Marie-Christine Adam as Madeleine * Vernon Dobtcheff as Jacques * Jacques Spiesser as Gilles * Annelise Hesme as Agnès Critical response The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 82% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 72 reviews. The site's consensus reads, \\"Priceless is a light, farcical rom-com that features sharp performances from Audrey Tautou and Gad Elmaleh.\\". Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 72 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". After its March 2008 premiere in the United States, Stephen Holden called the film an \\"amusing ball of fluff that refuses to judge its characters’ amoral high jinks\\"; he calls it a \\"shrewdly cast\\" film \\"winking at the vanity of wealthy voluptuaries and hustlers playing games of tainted love.\\" According to Holden, the film is \\"too frivolous even to be called satire.\\" According to Mick LaSalle, what makes the film \\"fun\\" is \\"the harshness wrapped in a pretty package. The movie stars Audrey Tautou and Gad Elmaleh, who are about the only French stars that it's almost impossible to imagine having an active sex life. Their aura of innocence helps. Still, in America, no director could ever make this movie, even with the most innocent- seeming actors on the planet. This is way European, folks, not meant for our eyes, and, of course, that's the whole kick.\\" LaSalle notes the following: > \\"Priceless is an entertaining sex farce that takes its characters to some of > best hotels and most exclusive restaurants in France, and to watch it is to > marvel at how some people live - and how you don't. But here's the > interesting thing: Through this seduction, Priceless turns the viewer into a > harlot, too, who can suddenly understand why Irene would do anything and > sleep with anybody just to stay in this lifestyle. Likewise, we understand-- > instinctively, without thinking about it or judging it--why Jean might start > sleeping with an older rich woman, just so he can stay in the hotels where > Irene stays. Would you want to be the person who orders the drinks or > fetches the drinks? How easy would it be to go back to normal life after > confirming what you never really wanted to know, that the rich really do > have it better, as in a lot better, as in money really does buy happiness? > So Priceless is silly, but it's not so silly. It's pretty to look at, often > very funny, but it corrupts its audience as it corrupts its characters.\\" In a one-star review () upon the film's June 2008 release in the United Kingdom, Peter Bradshaw call the film a \\"gruesomely unfunny and tacky comedy- farce\\" and notes \\"the whole movie slavers over bling, and has a nasty, dated air of pseudo-worldliness and ersatz sophistication. With its luxury-tourist locations, it is basically vulgar, and not in a good way, and reminded me of the opening title sequence to the 70s TV show The Persuaders!, but without that programme's charm.\\" References  External links   Category:2006 films Category:2006 romantic comedy films Category:French films Category:French romantic comedy films Category:French-language films Category:Films shot in Monaco Category:Films set in France Category:Films set in hotels Category:Films directed by Pierre Salvadori Category:2006 comedy films ","title":"Priceless (2006 film)"},{"id":"9502338","text":"33rd Street Records was an American independent record label based in Greenbrae, California.

She was born in Lancaster County in Manheim, Pennsylvania and attended school there. She later attended Drexel University and lived and worked as a schoolteacher in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her most well known work is Amanda: A Daughter of the Mennonites (1921); other works include Patchwork; a Story of \\"the Plain People\\" (1920), The Madonna of the Curb (1922), I Lift My Lamp, and a collection of poetry entitled Rain on the Roof (1931). Amanda, about a young Mennonite girl who seeks an education, is hired as a teacher in a local one-room schoolhouse, and eventually marries a childhood friend, contains many delightful appreciations of life along with early 20th century reminiscences, as indicated by such chapters as: \\"The Snitzing Party\\", \\"Boiling Apple Butter\\", \\"The Spelling Bee\\", and \\"One Heart Made o' Two\\" . Patchwork, the story of a young girl growing up within a community of \\"plain people\\", some of the story in the format of a diary, includes the girl's first romance. Myers' work is frequently viewed as a gentle corrective to the harsh misrepresentations of another novelist, Helen Reimensnyder Martin, also from Lancaster County, whose stories about the Pennsylvania Dutch of Lancaster County, particularly her Tillie: a Mennonite Maid, provoked cries of misrepresentation from those who resented her depictions. Myers also authored another work, quite different from her other fiction, I Lift My Lamp, a historical novel about the early settlement of Lancaster County, Henry William Stiegel and his glassworks in Manheim, a Mennonite Eby family, and the Ephrata Cloister.

C. McClurg was a stationer, publisher, and book wholesaler for over 120 years in Chicago, Illinois. The business began in 1844, as Chicago's first stationery store and changed hands several times, often as the result of a fire. Alexander McClurg came into management of the business at the time of the Great Chicago Fire (1871) and established an interest in fine literature, which was pursued by the company until late in the first decade of the 20th century. While pursuing interests in fine English literature and the literary magazine, The Dial, perhaps one of the most historically important books published by McClurg's \\"Rare Books\\" section was W. E. B. Du Bois' The Souls of Black Folk (1903). About a decade after McClurg's death, although the company kept his name, it shut down his Rare Books section of the business and pursued popular adventure, perhaps most famously in the original publishing of the Tarzan of the Apes novels and other stories of Chicago author, Edgar Rice Burroughs, as well as Tom Mix stories. While these book proved very successful, the business model eventually changed again, and from 1922 to 1962, A.C. McClurg was primarily a book wholesaler. History Logo used in 1910 McClurg Building in Chicago, Illinois, company headquarters after 1899. Designed by Holabird & Roche, it is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The company was founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1844 as W.W. Barlow & Co., which soon changed names to S. C. Griggs & Co. It was briefly known as Griggs, Bross & Co. after William Bross was admitted as a partner in 1848; the partnership dissolved after eighteen months. Alexander C. McClurg, a former law student who moved to Chicago to join the mercantile trade, joined the company in 1859. McClurg joined Griggs as a junior partner after he returned a general from the Civil War. The company building was burned down in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. After the fire, Griggs sold his share of the company and it became Jansen, McClurg & Co. McClurg became senior partner in 1887 and the company took the name of A. C. McClurg & Co. The company was again destroyed in a fire in 1899, but McClurg financed a new building. McClurg died in 1901, but the company retained his name in subsequent decades. A. C. McClurg revitalized The Dial magazine in 1880 as a platform of politics and literary criticism. Under Francis Fisher Browne, the magazine gained national prominence, but it was sold three years after Browne's death in 1913. In 1913, A. C. McClurg published its first Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan of the Apes book. McClurg would publish the first ten novels of the series. By 1923, the company's operations focused exclusively on wholesaling. The company remained in business until 1962.  Notes   References  External links * Records of the A.C.

History The PCN was founded in 1984 as a successor to the similar Parti Communautaire Européen. The party bases its ideas on those of Jean-François Thiriart (who served as an advisor to Michel for a time after the foundation of the group) and seeks the creation of a single European state stretching entity from Russia to the Atlantic coast. Including activists with origins on both the far-right and far-left, it seeks to liberate Europe from its \\"Yankee and Zionist enemies\\".Belgium 1996 report. Indeed, Professor Piero Ignazi has defined the group as an heir to Thiriart's early influential organisation Jeune Europe.Piero Ignazi, Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe, Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 126.

He was born in 1690 in the Tuscan city of Lucca, but spent most of his life in London and Edinburgh. Biography Very little is known about Barsanti's background. His father may or may not have been the opera librettist Giovanni Nicolao Barsanti (Il TemistocleSharman, Ian G. : “Francesco Barsanti: A fuller biography and a discussion of his Concerti Grossi (Op 3),” Journal Brio, Vol. 26, No. 1, International Association of Music Librarians (UK/IR), 1989. Sharman refers to an opera entitled \\"Il Temistocle\\" which was produced in Lucca in 1678, but states the composer is unknown. He cites the U.S. Library of Congress list of opera librettos printed before 1800. This is obviously not the same work as Johann Christian Bach's Temistocle, composed in London in 1767.) but this has never been proved. He studied law in Padua as a young man, but abandoned it to pursue a career in music. In 1714 Barsanti emigrated to London with Francesco Geminiani, another musician from Lucca who was several years his senior. He played oboe and recorder, and soon obtained a post in the opera orchestra at the Haymarket where Handel's operas were being produced.Hawkins, Sir John: A General History of the Science and Practice of Music, Vol. 5, T. Payne & Son, London, 1776 Nerici reports that he returned briefly to Lucca in 1717 and again in 1718 to play in the Festival of the Holy Cross, 'for a very high salary.'Nerici, Luigi: Storia della musica in Lucca, Vol. 12, Tipografia Giusti, Lucca, 1880 According to Hawkins and other authorities, in 1735 Barsanti left London for Edinburgh in Scotland where he obtained a post as a 'Master' with the Edinburgh Musical Society. He stayed in Scotland 8 years, during which time he benefitted from the support (moral if not financial) of the young Lady Erskine (Charlotte Hope) (1720-1788), and married a commoner named 'Jean', about whom nothing else is known. The fortunes of the EMS were less than stellar at that time; in 1740 the Society was obliged to cut Barsanti's salary from £50 per year to £25, and over the next three years, it refused two of Barsanti's requests for a raise.Sharman, Op. cit., citing the minutes of the Edinburgh Musical Society. Barsanti finally returned to London some time after 1743, with his wife and daughter Jane (known as 'Jenny'), but found that he has lost his place in musical society in London and was obliged to take a post as a violist in Handel's opera orchestra. He drew little income from his earlier compositions, and the two works he composed after his return to London brought him almost nothing. He suffered a stroke in 1772 on the eve of his daughter Jenny's début at Covent Garden, and died three years later, sometime between May 1 and 4, 1775 (see Burney, F.Troide, Lars E. & Cooke, Stuart J., eds.: Early Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney, Volumes III & IV, McGill-Queen's University Press, 1994). He was cared for to the end of his life by his daughter Jenny, a well- known actress upon the London and Dublin stages. Musical legacy Barsanti is known today primarily for his set of 6 solo sonatas for alto recorder (Opus 1). These sonatas were re-discovered in the late 1940s by Walter Bergmann, who published three of them for Schott and became an enthusiastic promoter of Barsanti throughout his career. The sonatas are particularly appreciated by recorder players because they are highly idiomatic. Bergmann is quoted as saying that they \\"not only show unusual knowledge of the recorder, as one would expect from a master of that instrument, but also high musical imagination. As musical creations, they are not inferior to any other recorder sonatas, including Handel's; technically, with their refined original phrasing, they are better.\\"Lasocki, David: “Walter Bergman (1902-1988) As Editor, Author, and Mentor,” Continuo, The Magazine of Old Music, vol. 15, nr. 5, 1991 He is also known among practitioners of traditional folk music for the twenty-eight Scots airs in his A Collection of Old Scots Tunes, which he arranged for harpsichord or solo melody instrument with figured bass. This work was dedicated to Lady Erskine. Barsanti's other works are less known but show a range of musical style and mastery of form that is impressive. His Nine Overtures (c. 1730, publisher unknown) include works in the French, German, and Italian styles; his ten concerti grossi (op. 3) contain fugal elements as well as influences from the sonata da chiesa form, and feature an interesting concertino group of horns and timpani, with the strings in the ripieno. Finally, the Sei Antifones (\\"Six Antiphonies\\"), which are among Barsanti's last published works, show Barsanti as a mature composer in a reflective, contemplative mood. They were composed, according to StenhouseStenhouse, William: Illustrations of the Lyric Poetry and Music of Scotland, Blackwood, Edinburgh & London, 1853 shortly before his departure from Scotland in 1743, and were dedicated to ~20-year-old Lady Catherine Charteris,Stenhouse, ibid. The dedication does not appear on the Welcker edition, which was published much later (c. 1762), so Stenhouse must have had access to a manuscript edition of the works, possibly the one which now resides in the British Library in part books formerly belonging to the British Madrigal Society. possibly written at her request, in the style of Palestrina.

The offensive lasted from 2 April to 13 April 1945. After a few days’ street fighting the Soviet troops captured the city. Background Vienna had been bombarded continuously for the last year previous to the arrival of the Soviet troops, damaging and destroying many buildings and facilities. Joseph Stalin reached an agreement with the Western Allies prior to April 1945 concerning the relative postwar political influence of each party in much of Eastern and Central Europe; however, these agreements said virtually nothing about the fate of Austria, then officially considered to be merely the Ostmark area of Greater Germany after the Anschluss. As a result, the victory of a Soviet offensive toward Austria and the liberation by the Red Army of a large part of this country would have been very beneficial for subsequent postwar negotiations with the Western Allies. After the failure of Operation Spring Awakening (Unternehmen Frühlingserwachen), Sepp Dietrich's 6th SS Panzer Army retreated in stages to the Vienna area. The Germans desperately prepared defensive positions in an attempt to guard the city against the rapidly arriving Soviets. In Spring 1945, the advance of Soviet General Fyodor Tolbukhin's 3rd Ukrainian Front through western Hungary gathered momentum on both sides of the Danube. After they took Sopron and Nagykanizsa, they crossed the border between Hungary and Austria. On 25 March, the 2nd Ukrainian Front launched the Bratislava–Brno Offensive by crossing the Hron river. On 30 March the Front crossed also the Nitra River and quickly rushed across the Danubian Lowland towards Bratislava. Having secured his right wing by 2nd Ukrainian Front, Tolbukhin was now ready to advance into Austria and take Vienna. The battle On 2nd April, Vienna Radio denied that the Austrian capital had been declared an open city. On the same day, Soviet troops approached Vienna from the south after they overran Wiener Neustadt, Eisenstadt, Neunkirchen and Gloggnitz. Baden and Bratislava were overrun on 4 April. After arriving in the Vienna area, the armies of the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front surrounded, besieged, and attacked the city. Involved in this action were the Soviet 4th Guards Army, the Soviet 6th Guards Tank Army, the Soviet 9th Guards Army, and the Soviet 46th Army. The \\"O-5 Resistance Group,\\" Austrians led by Carl Szokoll, wanting to spare Vienna destruction, actively attempted to sabotage the German defenses and to aid the entry of the Red Army. The only major German force facing the Soviet attackers was the German II SS Panzer Corps of the 6th SS Panzer Army, along with ad hoc forces made up of garrison and anti- aircraft units. Declared a defensive region, Vienna's defense was commanded by General Rudolf von Bünau, with the II SS Panzer Corps units under the command of SS General Wilhelm Bittrich. The battle for the Austrian capital was characterized in some cases by fierce urban combat, but there were also parts of the city the Soviets advanced into with little opposition. Defending in the Prater Park was the 6th Panzer Division, along the south side of the city were the 2nd and 3rd SS Panzer Divisions, and in the north was the Führer-Grenadier Division. The Soviets assaulted Vienna's eastern and southern suburbs with the 4th Guards Army and part of the 9th Guards Army. The German defenders kept the Soviets out of the city’s southern suburbs until 7 April. However, after successfully achieving several footholds in the southern suburbs, the Soviets then moved into the western suburbs of the city on 8 April with the 6th Guards Tank Army and the bulk of the 9th Guards Army. The western suburbs were especially important to the Soviets because they included Vienna's main railway station. The Soviet success in the western suburbs was followed quickly by infiltration of the eastern and northern suburbs later the same day. North of the Danube River, the 46th Army pushed westward through Vienna's northern suburbs. Central Vienna was now cut off from the rest of Austria. By the 9th of April, the Soviet troops began to infiltrate the center of the city, but the street fighting continued for several more days. On the night of 11 April, the 4th Guards Army stormed the Danube canals, with the 20th Guards Rifle Corps and 1st Mechanized Corps moving on the Reichsbrücke Bridge. In a coup de main on 13 April, the Danube Flotilla landed troops of the 80th Guards Rifle Division and 7th Guards Airborne Division on both sides of the bridge, cutting demolition cables and securing the bridge. However, other important bridges were destroyed. Vienna finally fell when the last defenders in the city surrendered on the same day. Bittrich's II SS Panzer Corps, however, pulled out to the west on the evening of 13 April to avoid encirclement. The same day, the 46th Army took Essling and the Danube Flotilla landed naval infantry up the river by Klosterneuburg. While the street fighting was still intensifying in the southern and western suburbs of Vienna on 8 April, other troops of the 3rd Ukrainian Front by-passed Vienna altogether and advanced on Linz and Graz. On the 10th, all but two of the bridges in the city had been destroyed. The Floridsdorf bridge had been left intact by a Fuehrer Order dictating that the bridge be held at all costs. The 2nd SS Panzer, \\"Das Reich\\" left a dozen artillery pieces including 37mm anti-aircraft guns to hold off enemy attacks. That night, the \\"Das Reich\\", including their last remaining three dozen armored vehicles, pulled out of the city for the last time. Vienna had fallen, and the Germans now moved northwest to hold the next defensive line. Aftermath Stalin's gratitude to one of the participants of the offensive By 15 April, armies of the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front pushed even further into Austria. The completely exhausted remnants of what had been the 6th SS Panzer Army were forced to flee to the area between Vienna and Linz. Just behind the retreating Germans were elements of the Soviet 9th Guards Army and the Soviet 46th Army. The 26th Army and 27th Armies advanced towards the area north of Graz just behind the retreating 6th Army. The 57th Army and the Bulgarian 1st Army advanced towards the area south of Graz (near Maribor) just behind the retreating 2nd Panzer Army. None of these German armies were in any shape to do more than temporarily stall the advancing Soviet forces. Some of Vienna's finest buildings lay in ruins after the battle. There was no water, electricity, or gas — and bands of people, both foreigners and Austrians, plundered and assaulted the helpless residents in the absence of a police force. While the Soviet assault forces generally behaved well, the second wave of Soviet troops to arrive in the city were reportedly badly undisciplined. A large number of lootings and cases of rape took place in a several-week long violence that has been compared to the worst aspects of the Thirty Years War. Like Bittrich, General von Bünau left Vienna before it fell to avoid capture by the Soviets. From 16 April until the war's end, he led Generalkommando von Bünau, surrendering to the Americans on VE Day. von Bünau was held as a POW until April 1947. Bittrich also surrendered to U.S. forces and was held as a prisoner by the Allies until 1954. Fyodor Tolbukhin went on to command the Soviet Southern Group of Forces and the Transcaucasian Military District until his death in 1949. Austrian politician Karl Renner astutely set up a Provisional Government in Vienna sometime in April with the tacit approval of the victorious Soviet forces, and declared Austria's secession from the Third Reich. =Final orders of battle (after the Vienna Offensive)= Axis Forces On 30 April, the following order of battle was recorded by the German Army High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, or OKW). From 20 April-2 May, OKW moved from Zossen (near Berlin) to Mürwik (part of Flensburg in north Germany, near Denmark).

It is a limestone hill whose pastureland is used for rough grazing, although a large proportion has been lost to limestone quarrying. It lies within the Castleton Site of Special Scientific Interest. Eldon Hill was formed when a bed of pure limestone was squeezed and upfolded by geological forces to form a dome; it is the highest limestone hill north of the River Wye. The hill is of considerable geological, historical and industrial interest; it lies at the northern limit of the carboniferous limestone in the Peak District, as further north it merges into the millstone grit of the Dark Peak. The name Elveden is first attested in 1285 as Elvedon and seems to have meant 'Elves' hill'. Quarrying permission was granted in 1950 and huge quantities of limestone have been excavated, mostly for road-building purposes. A large amount of the northern and northwestern slopes of the hill have disappeared and it has been called the best-known eyesore in the Peak District. In 1995 an application by RMC Aggregates to extend the quarrying further east was denied as parliament tightened up on environmental problems caused by old mineral permissions granted between 1948 and 1981. The quarry closed in 1999 and now stands unused with vegetation starting to grow on the quarry face. There have been some attempts at natural restoration with several aquatic pools being established in the former workings. The termination of quarrying has also given cavers the chance to explore some of the narrow caves exposed by the work, with Sidetrack Cave (discovered 2002) being one of the most impressive. In September 2020 the quarry was used as a film location for a series called Ray James, inspired by H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds. 350 metres south of the summit lies Eldon Hole. At 55 metres it is the deepest pothole in the area and was named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Peak by the philosopher Thomas Hobbes in 1636. According to folk tradition, it is the abode of the Devil. Close to the summit of the hill lies a Bronze Age tumulus, a large burial site measuring 16 by 15 metres and 1.5 metres high. The tumulus, a Scheduled Monument, has been excavated on several occasions with human skeletons and jewellery amongst the finds. The hill is dotted with numerous lead mines, all disused and many capped off for safety. Eldon Hill can be climbed either from the villages of Peak Forest to the south or Castleton to the north. The approach from Castleton goes up Cave Dale with a return down Winnats Pass to give a very interesting walk. The approach from Peak Forest is shorter and passes Eldon Hole on the way. The summit of the hill stands just 100 metres from the edge of the fenced quarry workings and gives good views with Mam Tor, Axe Edge Moor and the town of Buxton all well seen.

The quarry measures around from West to East and around from North to South, with an area of , which is surrounded by of woodland. The site has been used for quarrying since the mid-19th century. The Foster Yeoman Company was founded at Dulcote, in 1923, and later became part of Aggregate Industries. The site achieved an output of approximately 0.25M tonnes per year of Carboniferous Limestone, for general purpose construction aggregates. Much of the stone was moved on a branch line of the Great Western Railway by an independent company which became known as Mendip Rail. A Geodiversity audit of the site was carried out in 2004, which highlighted the limestone strata and fossils identified. These include Carboniferous Limestone overlain by Triassic Mercia Mudstones and Sandstones with geodes, which were formed by siliceous mineral replacement. In 2007 the quarry was bought by the Kilbride group, a subsidiary of Kilmartin Holdings which itself became part of Hansteen Holdings. When the parent company went into receivership the part owning Dulcote survived and put the worked-out quarry site up for commercial redevelopment with outline planning permission for a price of £1.5million. In 2016 the site was bought for development as a food production site for Charlie Bigham's, and opened in 2020.

He is best remembered for his association with the composer Christoph Willibald Gluck and is usually regarded as the most prominent haute- contre of his generation, though his acting is reputed to have been mediocre. Biography Legros was born at Monampteuil, Laon. After initial training as a choirboy, when his voice broke Legros developed the voice of a haute-contre, a type of French high tenor that was typically used for the heroic male lead in French operas of the period. Legros made his début at the Paris Opéra in 1764 in a revival of Mondonville's Titon et l'Aurore and became the leading haute-contre at the Opéra, a status he held until his retirement in 1783, caused in part by his increasing obesity. Legros began his operatic career singing the principal roles in revivals of the operas by Jean-Baptiste Lully and Jean-Philippe Rameau, and in the new works by their late followers. When in 1774, a foreign composer, Christoph Willibald Gluck, was for the first time invited to work for the Académie Royale de Musique, Legros had to confront the new composer's ground-breaking performing style. Although the singer \\"had an unusually brilliant and flexible upper register, particularly from top F to B flat\\", Gluck did not like either his expression or his acting ability,In fact, Gluck rejected most of the conventions in force at the Académie and came into conflict with the whole establishment (management, singers, dancers, orchestra). but he was obligated to entrust the company's principal tenor with the amatory leads in the operas he was going to produce. Accordingly, in 1774 Legros was charged with the roles of Achilles in Iphigénie en Aulide and, more important, Orphée in the new French version of Orfeo ed Euridice. In revising the latter opera, Gluck adapted for high tenor the male title role, originally intended for the alto castrato Gaetano Guadagni. During the long rehearsal bad-tempered Gluck is reported to have sometimes been very abrupt with the singer who seemed unfit to conform to his instructions. While coaching him in the opening chorus, Gluck addressed him like this: Nevertheless, Legros submitted himself to Gluck's rude coaching without protest and proved able to profit by it: at the premiere he turned out a quite new performer, to the Parisian musical circles' great surprise. \\"In considering what the role of Orpheus has done for M. Le Gros,\\" commented Abbé Arnaud, a big fan of Gluck, \\"I am tempted to believe that the chevalier Gluck's music is more stirring and theatrical than that of any other composer\\". For his part, Friedrich Melchior von Grimm, who was no such a Gluckist supporter, wrote it was difficult not to regard the metamorphosis of Legros \\"as one of the most prominent miracles wrought by the enchanter Gluck\\". Legros acquitted himself with honour even in the Italianate virtuoso style of the arietta \\"L'espoir renaît dans mon âme\\", interpolated at the end of Act I.Review in \\"Mercure de France\\", 15 September 1774, quoted in English by . Legros also showed his mastery of Italian coloratura four years later when he was confronted with another grand aria di bravura, \\"En butte aux fureurs de l'orage\\", from Roland, on the occasion of Niccolò Piccinni's debut at the Opéra. During the following nine years, he appeared in all the French operas by Gluck, taking the roles of Admetus in the 1776 revision of Alceste, Renaud in Armide, Pylades in Iphigénie en Tauride and Cynire in Echo et Narcisse. He also performed in four operas by Niccolò Piccinni, creating Médor in Roland, the title role in Atys, Pylades in this composer's setting of Iphigénie en Tauride, and Raimond de Mayenne in his setting of Adèle de Ponthieu. His final creation was the eponymous role in Antonio Sacchini's Renaud, which he handed over, however, after few performances. When in 1783 Legros was finally granted permission to retire with a pension of 2,000 livres, he was a member of the committee of artistes which had been charged with the management of the Opéra since the former director Antoine Dauvergne's resignation in 1782., Antoine Dauvergne (1713–1797). Une carrière tourmentée dans la France musicale des Lumières, Wavre, Mardaga, 2011, pp. 358 ff, . Denis-Pierre-Jean Papillon de la Ferté, the long-serving sole Intendant of the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi, who was ultimately in charge of the theatre, referred to Legros in commendatory terms: he was \\"the first singer of the Opéra\\" and his departure \\"would be a real loss for the administration\\". He even suggested Legros alone was qualified to fill the vacant directorship of the theatre. Papillon de la Ferté's suggestion, however, met with opposition from the rest of the committee and remained a dead letter. From 1777 Legros directed the Concert Spirituel, where he promoted performances of the music of Haydn and Mozart. He collaborated with Léopold-Bastien Desormery to rewrite the second act of François Lupien Grenet's opéra-ballet Le triomphe de l'harmonie. Their work was performed at the Opéra in 1775 under the title Hylas et Eglé. During this time he also composed an unperformed opera, Anacréon, and some songs. He died at La Rochelle.

Two ongoing Six Cities Design Festival initiatives, Design into Business and Learning, continue to offer conferences, workshops and classes nationwide. The Six Cities Design Festival is delivered by The Lighthouse (Glasgow): Scotland's National Architecture and Design Centre. The 2007 festival was backed by £3 million from The Scottish Government.http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2006/10/31155512 Background The Festival was announced by Scotland's former First Minister Jack McConnell in February 2005, after the 2 December 2005 publication of Creativity in Business, a review commissioned by The Chancellor Gordon Brown. The review argued that businesses in the UK are not utilising the creative industries to their fullest potential, nor do they realise the profitable impact such utilization can have.Cox Review index In an ongoing project entitled, The Value of Design Fact Finder, the UK Design Council has gathered supporting evidence that businesses that have invested in design over the past three years increase the likelihood of turnover growth.http://www.designfactfinder.co.uk/design- council/showSection.do?path=FactsInDetail,onDesignAndBusPerf,TheLinkBetweenDesignAndBetterBusinessPerformance Aligning with the findings of Creativity in Business and the UK Design Council, the Six Cities Design Festival's ongoing Design into Business and Learning programmes support Scottish designers and educate businesses on how to profitably engage with this sector. The Festival was officially launched on 31 October 2006 at media event at Dance Base in Edinburgh.Six Cities Design Festival The Design into Business programme The Six Cities Design Festival's Design into Business programme serves two primary functions: to educate Scottish businesses about utilising design to improve performance, productivity, and international competitiveness; and to provide professional development to the design community. The elements that make up the Design into Business programme are case studies, practical master classes, access to online resources, and presentations by keynote international business leaders. The Learning programme The Six Cities Design Festival's Learning programme provides professional development for the design community as well as educational programmes about design for the general public. The elements that make up the Learning programme are practical workshops, master classes, seminars, and public events, including lectures and family programmes. In 2006, The Learning programme of the Six Cities Design Festival joined Highlands & Islands Enterprise as partners of the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) led project, Starter for 6. The three-year project (2007—2009) will provide business support, mentoring and the opportunity to apply for a start-up grant of up to £10,000 to new Scottish entrepreneurs working in the science, technology or creative industries.£1m for Scotland's next generation of entrepreneurs - News Release - NESTA Public Programmes The Six Cities Design Festival's first main period of public programmes occurred during the main festival period, 17 May—3 June 2007. Over 300 free design-focused exhibitions, talks, tours and events took place across all six cities. Designers such as Peter Saville, Wayne Hemingway, Stefan Sagmeister and Zandra Rhodes participated in talks. Exhibitions from organizations such as the Vitra Design Museum and Norsk Form were on view. The Scottish Show 07 at The Lighthouse (Glasgow), was a key Festival exhibition, featuring 34 top Scottish designers. Following the international success of the original Scottish Show (2004-5), which promoted Scottish designers in Milan, London and Glasgow, Scottish Show 07 aimed to provide an international platform for Scottish talent.

Despite this, the PCE gradually declined in importance, particularly as Thiriart came to spend less time in Belgium. Many supporters of the PCE moved on to the Front National in the early 1980s as the group largely disappeared.

Martha Gallison Moore-Avery (April 6, 1851 - August 8, 1929) was an American socialist who later converted to Catholicism and became an anti-Socialism activist. After her conversion, she became the founder of the Catholic labor organization Common Cause Society and of the Catholic Truth Guild, which became the most extensive lay apostolate of the Catholic Church in America. Early years Avery was born in Steuben, Maine, in 1851, one of eight children of Albion King Paris Moore and Katherine Leighton Moore. After the death of her mother when she was 13, she moved to live with her grandfather, Samuel Moore, who was a member of the Maine Senate. Later, in Ellsworth, Maine, she started a millinery business and became actively involved in religious life, joining the local Unitarian church. In 1880, she married another member of her church, Millard Fillmore Avery, and shortly later moved to Boston, Massachusetts. Boston and socialism Boston exposed her to a much wider range of religious and social thought. There she studied metaphysics with Charles D. Sherman, an astrologer and student of Eastern thought. She also joined the Nationalist Club, a local society created to promote the ideas of socialist utopian author Edward Bellamy. Her involvement with socialism increased. A year after the death of her husband in 1890, she joined the Socialist Labor Party of America, and remained a leader in local socialist politics for a number of years. In 1896, she founded the Karl Marx Class, which would later be renamed the Boston School of Political Economy. Disenchantment with socialism During this period she became acquainted with David Goldstein. In response to the extremist activities and teachings of the Christian socialist George D. Herron, they gradually became disenchanted with what they saw as the irreligious and immoral implications of a socialist society until, in 1902, they proposed a motion at the Massachusetts socialist convention to formally repudiate any socialists who attacked religion or advocated violence or free love. After the defeat of their motion by the convention, they withdrew from the socialist party and became fervent anti-socialists, jointly publishing a book, Socialism: The Nation of Fatherless Children, in 1903. In this book Avery argued that socialism would inevitably lead to a situation where every child was an orphan under the control of the State.Allitt, Patrick; Catholic Converts: British and American Intellectuals Turn to Rome; p. 145. The book uses the example of Karl Marx's daughter Eleanor and how her \\"socialist marriage\\" led to unhappiness and suicide. Roman Catholicism During this time, she found herself developing a growing interest in Roman Catholicism. She sent her daughter to a local Catholic school because of her high regard for such schools. Her daughter would convert to Catholicism and eventually become a nun. Later, on May 1, International Workers' Day, Avery herself converted to Roman Catholicism. Catholic activism She continued to be a staunch advocate for social reform. However, she now based her ideas on those put forward in Pope Leo XIII's encyclical Rerum novarum. She was a proponent for the development of trade unions and collective bargaining, and was intensely involved in the new Catholic social justice movement. In 1922, she became the president of the Common Cause Society, a Catholic labor organization, and would remain in that position for the rest of her life, in the process becoming one of the major proponents of a public welfare state in the US. She felt that laissez-faire capitalism would destroy the family. She also wrote a book advocating her ideas about the Bolshevik Revolution titled Bolshevism: Its Cure in 1919. She also came to believe that it was important for her to evangelize for the Roman Catholic Church. In 1916, with her friend David Goldstein, she founded the Catholic Truth Guild, which over the years became the largest lay apostolate in the history of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. She continued to serve as a staunch advocate of labor reform and Catholicism until her death in 1929 of arteriosclerosis. Anti- women's suffrage Avery was a passionate opponent of women's suffrage, arguing that it served to destroy family coherence.Allitt; Catholic Converts, p. 147 In 1913 she was made an honorary vice president of the anti-suffrage Guidon Club. In 1912 she made a speaking tour of Ohio on behalf of the Ohio Association Opposed to Woman's Suffrage; in 1915 she made a speaking tour of Massachusetts sponsored by the Massachusetts Anti-Suffrage Committee.

Usually it is produced in written format but it can also be done in audio or audiovisually. Thousands of companies across the industrialized world have put their stories to paper, albeit in their own unique ways – from relatively benign, albeit colorful chronicles, usually written for the private archives of founding families, to titles with well- defined corporate applications. Corporate histories in the United States have been particularly prolific, those in the UK less so.  History  In the late 19th century, corporate histories were initially written by Victorian era businessmen, either the founder of a company himself, members of the surviving family owners or long-serving employees. Rather than being sequential histories, as is now done, many of them were diary-type personal recollections or short, superficial public relations exercises. One of the earliest corporate histories, that of a publishing company in the UK called the Catnach Press, was done in 1886. A notable early US corporate history, published in 1902, was that of Standard Oil. Academic involvement probably started in 1924 when George Unwin and co-author George Taylor published a detailed history, Samuel Oldknow and the Arkwrights: The Industrial Revolution at Stockport and Marple. It was published by the Manchester University Press. Between the World Wars, the majority of business histories, and especially in the UK, were house histories, consisting mainly of reminiscences and anecdotes. Only a tiny handful of serious work existed using business records which had found their way into museums, county record offices or the private possession of collectors. Corporate histories were typically unplanned. Relevant records were often discovered by chance and deemed interesting enough to turn into historical narratives which were funded either by the family descendants of the long-dead businessmen in question or, less frequently, the author in association with a publisher. They had one thing in common - they were generally records of companies that had died or otherwise dropped out of sight. One exception occurred In 1938, when the Bank of England commissioned a two-volume 250-year anniversary history. Written by J. H. Clapham, professor of economic history at Cambridge, it took six years to produce. It was a deliberately celebratory vehicle for this famous British institution. Modern corporate history took a large conceptual step in 1947 when the then chairman of Unilever, Geoffrey Heyworth (later Lord Heyworth) approached G. N. Clark, who had led the national campaign against the destruction of business records, for his advice on writing the history Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch manufacturing company. Clark, who had just become a professor of modern history at Oxford, suggested as author a younger colleague, Charles Wilson. The result was a classic, two-volume work that transformed the writing of business history in the UK from a public relations exercise into a reputable branch of scholarship. Wilson's work, about one of western Europe's most important companies, made him the father of modern corporate histories in the UK.  Current practices  The majority of books written today are PR projects expressly designed to celebrate important anniversaries. There are also fewer: More histories of British companies were being produced in the last year of the 19th century than were published in the last year of the 20th century. Many more corporate histories are used in the education system of the US than in the UK and other countries. Many companies see their corporate histories as effective purveyors of long-term organizational memory and especially suitable for transmitting strategy. As such it can provide an efficient induction/educational tool for transient employees in the highly flexible labor market. Corporate historians collect and catalog materials and disseminate information for internal use. \\"When people think of an archives, they tend to think of the National Archives in Washington,\\" Dave Smith, the manager of Walt Disney Co.'s multimillion-piece collection of artifacts, said in 2003. \\"But a lot of organizations maintain them, including businesses.\\"Kevin Markey, \\"The incredible value of everyday things: From soda to soap flakes, even mundane objects have blue-chip appeal\\", USA Today (weekend), 23 November 2003 Perhaps the largest corporate archive ever assembled is that of AT&T;, which began gathering historical material in 1921. As of 1999, its collection was overseen by a full-time staff of 11 people, and included of documents; 800,000 still photos; 12,000 various gadgets and artifacts, some of them dating back to Alexander Graham Bell; and 16,000 films and videos about AT&T.;David Stamps, \\"The Next Wave of the Future: History\\", Training magazine, 1 December 1999 See also *Organizational memory (OM) *Corporate culture *Corporate memory References  External links  *Society of American Archivists *Shashi Wiki, Bibliography records of Japanese Coroparate history books  Further reading  *Dahlstrom, Neil, “Perceptions and Realities: Dilemmas of a Corporate Historian,” AASLH History News, 60 (Autumn 2005), pp 12–15 *Arnold Kransdorff, Corporate Amnesia, Butterworth Heineman, 1998. *Arnold Kransdorff, Corporate DNA, Gower Publishing, 2006. *\\"Corporate History: The Merits of Looking Backward,\\" The Economist, 6 September 2007. *\\"History in Advertising: Using Brand History To Sell Products,\\" BusinessWeek, 8 January 2007. *\\"A Rummage Through the Corporate Attic,\\" The Financial Times, 24 July 2008. *\\"Celebrate the Past by Looking Forward,\\" The Financial Times, 7 August 2008.

The refuge was formed in 2000 after a 1989 order to gradually close the Jefferson Proving Ground, a World War II era munitions testing facility, which was completed by 1995. The refuge is located north of the historic firing line and surrounds a parcel operated by the Indiana Air National Guard. A zone used for firing tests remains off limit to the public due to the prohibitive cost of cleanup. Due to the past use of the property as an ordnance testing facility by the United States Army, all visitors must view a safety video and sign an Acknowledgement of Danger form annually prior to entering the refuge. Public use is limited to 4,000 acres on the northeast corner of the refuge surrounding Old Timbers Lake. Over 200 species of birds and 46 species of mammals are found on the refuge. Public uses of the refuge include hunting (white-tailed deer and wild turkey), fishing, and bird-watching.

Biography Scott was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Joseph and Martie Scott, of French and Norwegian heritage. A graduate of Northwestern Conservatory in Minneapolis, she also attended Stanley Girls' College. She came to New York City at the age of 17. When she failed to land the job she wanted, Scott played for a time with a stock company in Omaha, Nebraska. Scott made her Broadway (Manhattan) stage debut in The Barrier by Rex Beach. Scott's feature film debut came in The Lash of Destiny (1916). Mabel Julienne Scott (1923) In 1926, she played the role of the mother in The Lullaby, performed at the Pasadena Playhouse. One critic commented that Scott was uniquely suited to play the part for which she was cast. Other theatrical appearances of note are roles in Painted Faces, with comedian Joe E. Brown and The Copperhead, playing opposite Lionel Barrymore. In Behold My Wife (1920) she played the leading feminine role as Lali, an American Indian maiden. The film was produced by Famous Players. She shared an apartment in Hollywood for a time with her brother, William Scott, who was also an actor. Scott was paired with Roscoe Arbuckle in the Paramount Pictures release, The Round Up (1920). She was contracted to George Medford Productions but made motion pictures for both Famous Players and Goldwyn Pictures. Scott preferred acting in motion pictures to her work on the stage. She believed youth was a necessity to succeed in films. As the camera is more stringent than the eye, youth is not as essential in theater. Scott told an interviewer that the majority of successful stage actresses are middle-age and have a number of years of experience. An outdoor enthusiast, Scott was a frequent visitor to the Los Angeles, California Gun Club. She purchased a Thoroughbred sport model of the Lexington (automobile) in 1920. She married a prominent New York City physician. Mabel Julienne Scott died in Los Angeles in 1976.

Beaches exist where sand accumulated from centuries-old, recurrent processes that erode rocky and sedimentary material into sand deposits. River deltas deposit silt from upriver, accreting at the river's outlet to extend lake or ocean shorelines. Catastrophic events such as tsunamis, hurricanes, and storm surges accelerate beach erosion. Accretion and erosion  =Sudden and rapid processes =  Tsunamis and hurricane- driven storm surges  thumb Tsunamis, potentially enormous waves often caused by earthquakes, have great erosional and sediment-reworking potential. They may strip beaches of sand that may have taken years to accumulate and may destroy trees and other coastal vegetation. Tsunamis are also capable of flooding hundreds of meters inland past the typical high-water level and fast- moving water, associated with the inundating tsunami, can crush homes and other coastal structures. A storm surge is an onshore gush of water associated with a low pressure weather system--storms. Storm surges can cause beach accretion and erosion. Historically notable storm surges occurred during the North Sea Flood of 1953, Hurricane Katrina, and the 1970 Bhola cyclone.  Volcanism and earthquakes related sea-level changes Several geological events and the climate can change (progressively or suddenly) the relative height of the Earth's surface to the sea-level. These events or processes continuously change coastlines. Old sea level mark before these tremors. New quay at the Bay of Pozzuoli Volcanic activity can create new islands. The in diameter Surtsey Island, Iceland, for example, was created between November 1963 and June 1967. The island has since partially eroded, but it is expected to last another 100 years. Some earthquakes can create sudden variations of relative ground level and change the coastline dramatically. Structurally controlled coasts include the San Andreas fault zone in California and the seismic Mediterranean belt (from Gibraltar to Greece). The Bay of Pozzuoli, in Pozzuoli, Italy experienced hundreds of tremors between August 1982 and December 1984. The tremors, which reached a peak on October 4, 1983, damaged 8,000 buildings in the city center and raised the sea bottom by almost . This rendered the Bay of Pozzuoli too shallow for large craft and required the reconstruction of the harbour with new quays. The photo at the upper right shows the harbor before the uplift while the one on the bottom right shows the new quay. = Gradual processes = The gradual evolution of beaches often comes from the interaction of longshore drift, a wave-driven process by which sediments move along a beach shore, and other sources of erosion or accretion, such as nearby rivers. Deltas Deltas are nourished by alluvial systems and accumulate sand and silt, growing where the sediment flux from land is large enough to avoid complete removal by coastal currents, tides, or waves. Most modern deltas formed during the last five thousand years, after the present sea-level high stand was attained. However, not all sediment remains permanently in place: in the short term (decades to centuries), exceptional river floods, storms or other energetic events may remove significant portions of delta sediment or change its lobe distribution and, on longer geological time scales, sea-level fluctuations lead to the destruction of deltaic features. Subsidence and uplift related sea-level changes Subsidence is the motion of the Earth's surface downward relative to the sea level due to internal geodynamic causes. The opposite of subsidence is uplift, which increases elevation. St. Mark's Square, Venice, during flooding Venice is probably the best-known example of a subsiding location. It experiences periodic flooding when extreme high tides or surges arrive. This phenomenon is caused by the compaction of young sediments in the Po River delta area, magnified by subsurface water and gas exploitation. Man-made works to solve this progressive sinking have been unsuccessful. Mälaren, the third-largest lake in Sweden, is an example of deglacial uplift. It was once a bay on which seagoing vessels were once able to sail far into the country's interior, but it ultimately became a lake. Its uplift was caused by deglaciation: the removal of the weight of ice-age glaciers caused rapid uplift of the depressed land. For 2,000 years as the ice was unloaded, uplift proceeded at about /year. Once deglaciation was complete, uplift slowed to about annually, and it decreased exponentially after that. Today, annual uplift rates are or less, and studies suggest that rebound will continue for about another 10,000 years. The total uplift from the end of deglaciation may be up to .  Beach management  Coastal and oceanic landforms. Integrated coastal zone management minimizes the negative human impacts on coasts, enhances coastal defense, mitigates the risk associated with the sea level rise and other natural hazards. The beach erosion is a type of bioerosion which alters the coastal geography through beach morphodynamics. There are numerous incidences of modern recession of beaches, mainly due to the longshore drift and coastal development hazards related to human activities. Solutions range from \\"do nothing\\" to \\"Move beach seaward\\" approach which uses the elements of hard and soft engineering. The interventionist methods, such as \\"Move beach seaward\\", combine the hard engineering methods such as constructing structures (accropodes) with the soft engineering methods such as sand dune stabilization. These intervention are aimed at prevention of beach erosion caused by longshore drift and coastal development hazards, as well as facilitation of beach evolution and expansion. = Coastal planning approaches = Five general coastal planning approaches. Five generic planning approaches involved in coastal defense are: * Abandonment of shore: do nothing, let the natural process takeover. * Managed retreat, also called realignment. * Hold the shoreline: by using shoreline hardening techniques to create permanent concrete and rock constructions such as groynes. * Move beach seaward: by using hard and soft intervention techniques usually in areas of high economic significance. * Limited intervention: usually in areas of low economic significance, often includes the succession of haloseres, including salt marshes and sand dunes. = Coastal engineering = Two coastal engineering techniques are: hard and soft engineering methods.  Hard engineering methods Hard engineering methods are also called \\"Structural methods\\". \\"move towards the sea\\" beach accretion can be facilitated by the four main type of hard engineering structures, namely seawall, revetment, groyne or breakwater. Most commonly used hard structures are seawall and series of \\"headland groyne\\" (breakwater connected to the shore with groyne). = Main types of structures = Four main types of structures or accropodes are seawalls, groynes, breakwater and revetments. Headland groynes are a combination of breakwater and groyne.  Seawalls  Seawalls re- direct most of the incident energy in the form of sloping revetments, resulting in low reflected waves and much reduced turbulence. Designs use porous designs of rock or concrete objects such as Tetrapods or Xblocs with flights of steps for beach access. Seawall at Cronulla beach, NSW,Armour Units – Random Mass or Disciplined Array, – C.T.Brown ASCE Coastal Structures Specialty Conference, Washington, March 1979; The Design & Construction of Prince St. Seawall, Cronulla, EHW Hirst & D.N.Foster – 8th CCOE, Nov 1987, Launceston, Tasmania for example, uses concrete wall. Submerged seawalls or structures are constructed to create the underwater reefs to slow down wave energy and beach erosion. Image:Oosterscheldekering, Netherlands.JPG  Sea wall. Image:Porto2_eurosion.jpg  Stone Seawall with cemented walkway, mud revetment stabilized with grass, and gravel riprap armament at the base.  Groynes and Headland groyne  Groynes are the walls perpendicular to the coastline. Groynes are generally placed in series and the areas between groups of groynes are called groyne fields. To directs the sand towards the shore targeted for sand accumulation, a shorter groyne turned slightly towards downdrift side of the beach is deployed at updrift end of the beach, a longer groyne at the downdrift end of the beach is deployed, a series of groyne are deployed between the two ends. Groynes are often made of gabion, greenharts, concrete, rock or wood. Material builds up on the downdrift side, where littoral drift is predominantly in one direction, creating a wider and a more plentiful beach. Groynes are cost-effective, require little maintenance and are one of the most common defences. ; Headland groyne or Bulkhead breakwater:When groyne is built to attach a breakwater to shore, the resulting T-structure is called \\"headland breakwater\\", \\"headland groyne\\", \\"bulkhead groyne\\" or \\"bulkhead breakwater\\". Use of groynes and headland groyne, accumulates the sand across the beach but it tend to deplete the sand faster from the downdrift end of the beach. This can be mitigated and sand could be accumulated at the downdrift end of the beach also. This is achieved by having a longer \\"groyne\\" or \\"headland groyne\\" at the end of downdrift side of the beach. To enhance the sand accumulation, this \\"headland groyne\\" could have another series of smaller \\"headland groyne\\" jutting out of it pointing towards updrift end of the beach in a way that the smaller \\"headland groyne\\" are parallel to the shore and perpendicular to main \\"headland groyne\\". This will facilitate gradual natural creation of ayre (sand or gravel filled beach). If there is a near shore island near the downdrift end of the beach and \\"headland groyne\\", then this could be turned into a cuspate foreland headland with the use of the gradual natural creation of ayre (gravel filled beach). Main \\"headland groyne\\" at the end of downdrift could be further stabilized by a hard engineered detention basin and grassy mangrove salt marsh. Salt marsh could be created with the use of soft engineering approach, such as lose stone sills, while leaving a whole in the sill for a seawater channel. Seawater channel could be a cemented open channel or a pipe buried under the beach. This marsh could be designed to taper into a hard engineered sandy beach. Having inland saltwater marsh between the beach and mainland will lower the cost by eliminating the need for filling up the marshy area with the sand, and the mangroves and grasses in the marsh will facilitate gradual built up of sediments.

Image:East_Coast_Park,_Mar_06.JPG  \\"Headland groyne\\" at East Coast Beach in Singapore consists of breakwater parallel to shore and connected to shore by a vertical groyne. Higher mainland is fortified with a low rise mud seawall which has been further stabilized by planting grass and trees.  Breakwater  Breakwater, also called \\"offshore breakwater\\", are offshore structure constructed parallel to the shore to alter wave direction and tide energy. The waves break further offshore and therefore lose erosive power. This leads to formation of wider beaches, which further absorb wave energy. A series of breakwaters is often deployed across the beach shore.  Revetment  Revetments are slanted or upright blockades, built parallel to the coast, usually towards the back of the beach to protect the area beyond. The most basic revetments consist of timber slants with a possible rock infill. Waves break against the revetments, which dissipate and absorb the energy. The shoreline is protected by the beach material held behind the barriers, as the revetments trap some of the material. Unless other mthods are used in combination, surf progressively erodes and destroys the revetment which requires ongoing maintenance. = Other types of structures = Other types of structures used are:  Riprap / Rock armour Rock armour, also called riprap, is basement placed at the sea edge using local material. This could be the protruding foot of a seawall or revetment to reduce maintenance of those. Longshore drift is not hindered.  Cliff stabilization  Cliff stabilization can be accomplished through drainage of excess rainwater of through terracing, planting and wiring to hold cliffs in place.  Floodgates  Floodgates prevent damage from storm surges or any other type of natural disaster that could harm the area they protect. They are habitually open and allow free passage, but close under threat of a storm surge. The Thames Barrier is an example of such a structure. = Construction elements = These construction elements can be incorporated in any of the above structures, either as core element or as a supplementary element to enhance to reduce the cost and maintenance of main structural elements.  Concrete objects  These are complex reinforced concrete objects, such as A-jack, Akmon, Dolos, Honeycomb sea wall (Seabees), KOLOS, Tetrapod and Xbloc. Simple concrete blocks have been replaced by these complex concrete objects because these objects more resistant to wave action and requires less concrete to produce a superior result. These could be used to build seawalls, groyne, breakwater, and other structures including residential buildings. Tetrapod used at Marine Drive, Mumbai are an example of complex concrete objects.

Gabions  Gabions are constructed by wiring boulders and rocks into mesh cages and placed in front of areas vulnerable to erosion, sometimes at cliffs edges or at right angles to the beach. When the ocean lands on the gabion, the water drains through leaving sediment, while the structure absorbs a moderate amount of wave energy. Gabions need to be securely tied to protect the structure. It could be used to build seawalls, groyne, breakwater, revetment, buildings, underwater reefs, etc, Image:Gabion-hengistbury-head.JPG  Gabion, welded wiremesh filled with stone.  Soft engineering methods  Soft engineering uses a “soft” (non- permanent) structure by creating a larger sand reservoir, pushing the shoreline seaward. It gained popularity because it preserved beach resources and avoided the negative effects of hard structures. = Managed retreat= Managed retreat means the shoreline is left to erode, while relocating buildings and infrastructure further inland. =Beach evolution= Beach evolution, also called \\"beach replenishment\\" or \\"beach nourishment\\", it involves importing sand from elsewhere and adding it to the existing beach. The imported sand should be of a similar quality to the existing beach material so it can meld with the natural local processes and without adverse effects. Without the groynes or scheme requires repeated applications on an annual or multi-year cycle. Beach nourishment can be used in combination with seaward curving halfmoon shaped \\"headland breakwater\\" structure, this combining the benefits of breakwater and groyne structures. =Sand dune stabilization= Sand dune stabilization protects beaches by catching windblown sand, increasing natural beach formation. Fences can allow sand traps to create blowouts and increase windblown sand capture. Plants such as Ammophila (Marram grass) can bind the sediment. =Beach drainage= The beach face dewatering lowers the water table locally beneath the beach face. This causes accretion of sand above the drainage system. = Cost considerations= The costs of installation, operation and maintenance vary due to: * system length (non-linear cost elements) * flow rates (sand permeability, power costs) * soil conditions (presence of rock or impermeable strata) * discharge arrangement /filtered seawater utilization * drainage design, materials selection & installation methods * geographical considerations (location logistics) * regional economic considerations (local capabilities /costs, availability of local material and native skilled workforce) * study requirements /consent process. = An illustrative example = Salt marsh during low tide, mean low tide, high tide and very high tide (spring tide). Mangrove's above and below water view at the edge of the shore. This Integrated coastal zone management example is based on the \\"move beach seaward\\" general planning approach which involves both hard and soft engineering methods. This scenario minimizes the maintenance effort and cost by making optimal use of the coastal geography by incorporating natural coastal geographical features in the engineering design. The cost is kept low by the use of easily available free or cost-effective local material, use of which is already known to or easily acquired by the local workforce. This solution entails beach nourishment (creating recreational area by filling with sand), and further beach expansion and prevention of beach erosion caused by longshore drift and coastal development hazards. The design makes use of a shorter groyne slightly inclined toward the beach in the same direction as downdrift, with a series of \\"headland groyne\\" perpendicular to the shore, and a longer \\"headland groyne\\" at the end of downdrift side of the beach with smaller \\"headland groyne\\" perpendicular to it facing the updrift end of the beach. This example of tropical setting, part of the sea could be reclaimed by building a seawall with revetment (slope) fortified with armament of honeycomb seebee made of concrete with hexagonal holes, parts of seawall could be made of gabion. Seawall will sitAllen, Richard Thomas Lingen, Concrete in Coastal Structures, page 47 over gravel or rock. Seawall could be a mix of vertical structures in the areas where more space is needed and tapering revetments (slope) as aesthetic landscaping feature. Revetments could be made of locally available material. Different parts of revetment could have different material and design, such as gabion (welded wire mesh filled with stone, gravel and wood) and honeycomb seebee (made of concrete with hexagonal holes). Honeycomb seebee or gabion could be used in the downdrift areas, though wood groyne would be the cheapest option such as used at Mundesley. Other areas of seawall and revetment could be a mix of cemented low walls, gabion, riprap made of gravel or sand bags. Parts of seawall and revetment could be left exposed especially those made of decorative gabion, and others parts could be covered with low or mid level native plants. Seawall will sitAllen, Richard Thomas Lingen, Concrete in Coastal Structures, page 47 over gravel or rock base which could be wider than the seawall so that it also acts as the riprap armament. Reclaimed area could be filled with the sand and stabilized by aesthetic landscaping by growing native trees and plants. A dense layer of native tropical trees could be planted at the mainland side of the reclaimed land with due consideration to the height of the trees that they do not block the view of any construction such as resort or beach house. Reclaimed area would enhance the economical value by creating a sand filled safe recreation area which might house sunbathing areas and inland freshwater or seawater wading pool or lagoon surrounded by bars, restaurants, water sports, etc. Restaurants could have retractable-canopied areas set closer to the seawall greenified with tapering layers of evergreen native tropical plants. Bars could be open air, portable or canopied (thatched roof nipa hut and trellis of native material, pergola or beach parasol) bars with pool and beach seating. Seating could be relaxing-and-sprawling reclined futon type, sunken sand pits, sand filled bean bags on the beach, locally made designer stools/chairs and tables made of native eco-friendly natural material such as bamboo, aged rustic driftwood and abundant low weathering native wood.

Status of beaches  = Historical accretion of beaches = Main stages of Holocene evolution of the Rhone delta. In the Mediterranean Sea, deltas have been continuously growing for the last several thousand years. Six to seven thousand years ago, the sea level stabilized, and continuous river systems, ephemeral torrents, and other factors began this steady accretion. Since intense human use of coastal areas is a relatively recent phenomenon (except in the Nile delta), beach contours were primarily shaped by natural forces until the last centuries. In Barcelona, for example, the accretion of the coast was a natural process until the late Middle Ages, when harbor-building increased the rate of accretion. The port of Ephesus, one of the great cities of the Ionian Greeks in Asia Minor, was filled with sediment due to accretion from a nearby river; it is now from the sea. Likewise, Ostia, the once-important port near ancient Rome, is now several kilometres inland, the coastline having moved slowly seaward. Bruges became a port during the early Middle Ages and was accessible by sea until around 1050. At that time, however, the natural link between Bruges and the sea silted up. In 1134, a storm flood opened a deep channel, the Zwin, linking the city to the sea until the fifteenth century via a canal from the Zwin to Bruges. Bruges had to use a number of outports, such as Damme and Sluis, for this purpose. In 1907, a new seaport was inaugurated in Zeebrugge. = Modern beach recession = thumb At the present time, important segments of low coasts are in recession, losing sand and reducing beach dimensions. This loss can occur very rapidly. There are various reasons for beach recession, some more natural than others (degree of anthropization). Examples of this are occurring at Sète, in California, in Poland, in Aveiro (Portugal), and in the Netherlands and elsewhere along the North Sea. In Europe, coastal erosion is widespread (at least 70%) and distributed very irregularly. California beaches California's beaches and other shoreline features change according to the availability of beach sand, the wave and current energy impinging on the coast, and other physical processes that affect the movement of sand. A constant supply of sand is necessary for beaches to form and be maintained along this shoreline. Many human activities, including dam construction and river channelization, have reduced the supply of sand that reaches the ocean. This, in turn, has prevented beaches from being replenished and has thus created greater vulnerability for shorelines that have always been subject to varying levels of erosion. There are few practical solutions to improving sand supply from inland sources, so management of shoreline erosion will likely continue to focus at the land/sea interface along the California coastline. Construction of breakwaters, jetties, or groyne fields to protect harbor entrances, maintain beaches, or protect coastal structures have both helped and harmed the movement of sand along the shoreline. Protective armoring formations trap sand and allow beaches to expand up-coast from the device, but can interrupt the flow of sand to beaches located down- coast. El Niño) El Niño) France =Atlantic coast= Old German-built WWII bunkers at Capbreton, south-west of France Some of the coastal defence bunkers of the Atlantic Wall, built by the German soldiers during the Second World War at the top of the dunes are now underwater 2/3 of the times. It shows 200 meters of recession of the beach in 65 years. =Sète= The coast recession near Sète is related with coastal drift sand supply interruption due to growth of the Rhone delta, which (like most deltas) is becoming independent of the rest of the coast. The present lido shoreline is 210 meters away from the Roman lido. Netherlands Holland coast The Dutch coast consists of sandy, multi-barred beaches and can be characterised as a wave-dominated coast. Approximately 290 km of the coast consists of dunes and 60 km is protected by structures such as dikes and dams. With the melting of the ice at the end of the last ice age, the coastline shifted eastward until about 5000 years ago the present position of the Dutch coastline was reached. As the sea level rise stagnated, the sand supply decreased and the formation of the beach ridges stopped, after which when the sea broke through the lines of dunes during storms, men started to defend the land by building primitive dikes and walls. The dunes, together with the beach and the shoreline, offer a natural, sandy defence to the sea. About 30% of the Netherlands lies below sea level. Holland coast recession Over the last 30 years, approximately 1 million m³ sand per year has been lost from the Dutch coast to deep water. In most northern coastal sections, erosion occurs in deep water and also in the nearshore zone. In most southern sections, sedimentation occurs in the nearshore zone and erosion in deep water. Structural erosion is due to sea-level rise relative to the land and, in some spots, it is caused by harbour dams. The Dutch coast looked at as a single unit shows erosive behaviour. Approximately 12 million m³ of sand is transferred annually from the North Sea to the Wadden Sea as a result of relative rising sea level and coastal erosion. Poland During the last glaciation, the Baltic Polish area was covered in ice and associated morainal sediments. Deglaciation left a substantial amount of unconsolidated sediment. Currently, these unconsolidated sediments are strongly eroded and reworked by the sea. Image:poland1_eurosion.jpg Image:poland6_eurosion.jpg Image:poland7_eurosion.jpg Image:poland3_eurosion.jpg Image:poland4_eurosion.jpg Portugal The North Portuguese coast and its beaches were fed by large Iberian rivers. The massive building of dams in the Douro River basin has cut the sediment supply to the Aveiro coast, resulting in its recession. Hard protective works have been done all along.

Analogous to interviews that are undertaken in journalism and sociology, its outcome in a comprehensive form is also known as ‘oral history’. Its application is additionally evident in disciplines ranging from psychotherapy, witness interrogation in crime investigations and in industry and commerce, both in oral and visual formats. In the latter, it is now associated with knowledge management, where the discipline is getting more attention since the advent of the flexible labor market, which is the single biggest knowledge disrupter of modern times. Introducing the biggest change in workplace practice for more than a century, the flexible labor market has imposed on employers an Alheimer-like corporate amnesia as employees change jobs on average every four or five years in many countries. The loss of ‘organizational memory’, the body of data, information and knowledge relevant to an individual organization's existence, is massive, inhibiting the ability of organizations to learn from their own experiences. Oral debriefing is becoming increasingly recognized as a powerful tool with which to capture this exiting institutional knowledge. History In its contemporary formulation, the techniques of oral debriefing were first explored in the US in the 1940s in New Deal projects to preserve the reminiscences of former slaves and unlettered rural folk, and then in Europe. Its first cheerleader and practitioner was the American social commentator and writer Studs Terkel (). Born in 1912 and trained as a lawyer before becoming a journalist and writer, his fascination with the medium came soon after the tape recorder's commercial exploitation when he started interviewing a whole cross-section of American society in order to piece together a jig-saw of experiences. From taxis drivers and teachers, the poor and the rich, young and old, his books on subjects ranging from race relations to war have provided a rich range of social opinion and attitudes of a nation undergoing rapid social change. Terkel's pioneering work was concurrent with the efforts of the US academic Professor Allan Nivens who, after successfully persuading educationalists to introduce oral history as a tool for serious scholarship in the 1940s, founded the Oral History Collection at Columbia University (http://library.truman.edu/microforms/columbia_oral_history.htm). Since then other universities, including Harvard, Princeton, the University of California, Berkeley, have also developed extensive collections of oral history. In the early 1950s Nivens brought oral history to industry when he organised the interview of more than 400 people for a history of the Ford Motor Company. Since then a handful of companies have supported similar programs, among them ARCO, Beckman Instruments, Bristol-Myers, Eli Lilley, Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, Monsanto, Procter & Gamble, Rohm and Haas and Standard Oil Company. In Europe, most of the efforts in oral history have been confined to non-business activities, where its use is relatively widespread in sociological and straight historical research. In a rare business-type project called \\"City Lives”, the National Life Story Collection attached to the British Library Sound Archive has been interviewing about 100 top men and women from financial institutions who have lived through the changes since WW2 (http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nationallifestories.html). Aside from that, only a small number of British companies have undertaken projects to record the memories and experiences of their employees, among them London Transport, which has made a special effort with their West Indian workforce, the brewers Bass, the telecommunications company Cable & Wireless and, until the project was aborted in 1991 as a cost-saving exercise, Ford UK. The uses to which they have put the information have generally been for museum exhibits or public relations. =Exit interviews enhanced= Modern oral debriefing is an enhancement of the old-fashioned prescriptive and formulaic exit interview, which is typically not an interview at all, rather the output of a formulaic questionnaire that attempts to uncover why employees – usually lower hierarchy workers - leave. The oral debrief has been sophisticated to the extent that its output is now a powerful means of extracting from individuals valuable knowledge that can be used to improve on past performance. The most accomplished practitioners are the US military, which has developed vast archives of oral testimony of wars since WW2 specifically as an educational tool for successive generations. The Department of the Army, for example, calls the process the End of Tour (EoT) interviews, which are conducted with departing commanders to make interviews available to their incoming replacements so that individuals can better understand the issues faced by their predecessors. Equally, companies such as Ford, ARCO, Beckman Instruments, Bristol-Myers, Eli Lilley, Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical, Monsanto, Procter & Gamble, Rohm and Haas and Standard Oil Company have also initiated programs of oral history but their application in decision-making is tentative. The oral debriefing usually centres on the issues and decisions unique to the organization and can be especially instructive as a decision- making tool. With senior decision-makers the most common candidates, such debriefings are always conducted near the end of a person's tenure, although some practitioners are now using it on a more regular basis and in project management. Whilst the co-operation of interviewees is essential, the quality of recall is often dependent on the skill of the interviewer, who needs to be commanding enough not to be intimidated by the interviewee and insightful enough to identify and pursue pertinent questions. The actual skill of oral debriefing is the art of asking relevant questions and when the answers are unclear or fudged, the asking of even more probing questions. In the world of evidential gathering where rigorous substantiation is a pre-requisite for all experiential learning, the oral route is often more valuable than anything extracted from written sources. The reason is that managers are generally better speakers than they are writers. Also, their spoken word is invariably a more efficient way of conveying the abstract and complex nature of elements like the nuances of corporate culture, management style and the often-obscure issues surrounding decision-making within groups. Importantly, it can be effective at capturing the tacit ‘humanware’ elements of organizational memory. =The other types of oral debriefing= In addition to the augmented exit interview there are three other types of oral debriefing. The biographical debrief focuses on an individual's life or career. Conducted at stages during or at the end of an individual's career, it is usually directed at very senior officers, often founders or people with decisive effects on organizational development. Its educational value to the organization is important because it can provide industry- and organization-specific insights into such aspects as culture, values and the way strategy would have altered over time alongside a changing market place. Separately, it also doubles as a motivator to successive generations. The second type is the subject debrief, which concentrates on obtaining knowledge about a single event or topic, such as a product launch or new building development, where research may require interviews with several people to obtain complete coverage. Its application is valuable when project performance is often over budget or overdue. Thirdly there is the critical incident debrief, which, as it suggests, occurs when there is an unexpected event, usually something damaging. Debriefs are usually carried out as soon after the episode as possible and include as many of the people involved, even non-managers. The debriefs provide only the evidential component of experiential learning. The learning arises when the experience (from oral debriefing and other sources) is assessed and then assigned its own meaning in terms of individual and/or the organization's own goals, aims, ambitions and expectations. From these processes come the insights and added meaning, which is then applied to new circumstances. The end product is better decision-making.

This group is unique in the rose family in that it is predominantly wind- pollinated. They are usually gnarled in shape, but in certain areas some trees are 15–20 m tall and have 2 m-thick trunks. The foliage is evergreen, with dense small leaves, and often having large amounts of dead twigs hanging down from the underside of the canopy. The name Polylepis is, in fact, derived from the Greek words poly (many) plus letis (layers), referring to the shredding, multi-layered bark that is common to all species of the genus. The bark is thick and rough and densely layered for protection against low temperatures. Some species of Polylepis form woodlands growing well above normal tree line within grass and scrub associations at elevations over 5000 m; which makes Polylepis appear to be the highest naturally occurring arboraceous angiosperm genus in the world. Classification/taxonomy The genus Polylepis contains about twenty species that are distributed across the Andes. It is in the rose family, Rosaceae. The genus belongs to the tribe Sanguisorbeae, which mainly comprises herbs and small shrubs. Although the relationship of Polylepis to other genera of Sanguisorbeae is largely unknown, the analysis of Torsten Eriksson et al. (2003) showed evidence of a close relationship between Polylepis and Acaena, which shows tendencies towards having fused stipular sheaths, reddish, flaking-off bark, and axillary, somewhat pendant inflorescences, features otherwise characteristic of Polylepis. There are several characteristics that are important taxonomically to distinguish between species of Polylepis, for example: 1) The amount of leaf congestion, 2) presence or absence of spurs and their size and vestiture, 3) presence or absence and type of trichomes, (4) size, shape, thickness and vestiture of leaflets. The most important taxonomic character, however, is the leaflets. Studies suggest that repeated fragmentation and reconnection of páramo vegetation, caused by the Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, had a strong influence on the evolution and speed of speciation in the genus Polylepis as well as the páramo biota as a whole.  Species  Habitat and distribution Tree species in the genus Polylepis are confined to the high tropical South American Andes Mountains, with the most abundant concentrations of Polylepis ranging from northern Venezuela to northern Chile and adjacent Argentina. One known group of extra-tropical populations of Polylepis is distributed in the mountains of Northwestern Argentina. Most species of Polylepis grow best at high elevations between 3500 and 5000 meters. However, there are occurrences of species at altitudes as low as 1800 meters. These low altitude species are mixed with montane forest which indicates that components of the genus could have been present in western South America during the Miocene Period or even earlier. It is extremely rare for tree species to live at such altitudes, making Polylepis one of the highest naturally occurring trees along with the conifers of the Himalayan Mountains. Polylepis racemosa grows as shrubby trees on steep, rocky slopes above cloud forest. Polylepis tarapacana is one that reaches 4,800 m; the highest elevation of tree growth in the world. There is much debate on whether Polylepis was forced to exhibit such extreme elevation habitats due to habitat destruction by human interference. Physiological tolerances for growth at these elevations are subject to considerable debate among scientists, but evidence indicates that even before severe decimation by man, high elevation trees were limited in their distribution by the presence of specialized microhabitats. Due to the harsh environment in which many species of Polylepis grow the growth of the tree's stems and branches are generally contorted. This abnormal growth is often associated with windy, cold or arid habitats. The climate of the South American Andes changes drastically throughout the region creating many microhabitats. Overall, the climate consists of short southern summers when temperatures are warm and rainfall is high and long winters when temperatures are low and rainfall is limited. The temperature and amount of rainfall also depend on which side of the mountain (eastern or western side), elevation and latitude. Morphological characteristics P. rugulosa) Bark: The bark of Polylepis consists of numerous layers of thin, dark red exfoliating sheets. In some cases, the layered bark can be more than an inch thick. A majority of the larger branches have similar shredding bark. It would seem that the bark serves as insulation from both the nightly frosts and the intense daytime irradiation. The thick bark of Polylepis also serves an important function as protection against fire. It is thought to originally have been a protection against epiphytic mosses, whose thick masses may damage trees by adding weight to the branches and providing a suitable environment for fungi which attack the trees. Branching pattern and leaf arrangement: Polylepis trees tend to have twisted, crooked stems and branches with repeated sympodial branching. Contorted growth is often associated with windy, cold, or arid habitats. The leaves are generally congested along the branch tips often at the end of long, naked branch segments. Stipule sheath: Each leaf has a pair of stipules fused around the branch forming a sheath. The crowding of the leaves results in a pattern of stacked, inverted cones due to the overlapping of the stipule sheaths. On the top of the sheaths on either side of the petiole there are often projections, or spurs. The presence or absence of these spurs and their size are important taxonomic characteristics. Leaves and leaflets: All species of Polylepis have compound, imparipinnate leaves, but the number of pairs of leaflets varies within and between species. The arrangement of the leaflets and the position from the terminal leaflet of the largest pair of leaflets determine the shape of the leaf. The outline of the leaf is usually rhombic in species with one pair of leaflets. Depending on the position of the largest pair, the leaf can be trullate to obtrullate in taxa with more than one leaflet pair. Leaf anatomy: The leaves of all species are built on a dorsiventral arrangement of cells, with the epidermis and palisade layer on the adaxial surface and the spongy tissue on the abaxial surface. Reproduction The pollen of Polylepis can be described as monads, isopolar, and more or less spheroidal to slightly oblate in shape. They have both an elongated and rounded aperture and the limits of the endoaperture (the inner openings of compound the aperture) are obscure. The elongated part of the aperture is completely covered by a pontoperculum. The fruits of Polylepis are essentially achenes composed of the floral cup fused to the ovary. Fruits of all species are indehiscent (they do not open at maturity) and one seeded. The surface of the fruit of different species has ridges, knobs, spines or wings. There are no definite sites for the placement of these different types of protrusions that appear irregularly over the surface. The type of protrusion, wings verses spines, or knobs versus wings, is useful for distinguishing between species. The flowers of all species of the genus are born on inflorescences. In most cases the inflorescences are long enough to hang like a pendant, but in the westernmost populations of P. tomentella and in at least one population of P. pepei, the inflorescence is so reduced that it remains almost hidden in the leaf axil. In the species with pendant inflorescences, the flowers are born regularly along the rachis or clustered toward the terminal end. The flowers themselves are reduced and have many features associated with wind pollination. These include: the absence of petals, green rather than colored sepals, an absence of scent or nectar, numerous anthers with long filaments, abundant, dry pollen, a large, spreading, fine fringed stigma, compounded pinnate leaves and the growth of trees in strands. Pollination and dispersal Wind-pollination was a useful and evolutionary event in the adaption to the highlands, where insects are much scarcer than in warmer climates. By relying on wind for pollination, species distribution and phylogeny reconstruction have different patterns than insect-pollinated genus. Wind pollination allows genetic information to cover large distances and hurdle reproductive barriers. The fruits of all species must be wind dispersed because members of the genus are trees and are thus too tall for animals (presumably mammals) to brush against on the ground. However, the elaboration of spines on the fruits of many taxa would argue for animal dispersal although wind dispersal undoubtedly predominates in P. australis. Numerous birds forage or live in Polylepis trees and it is possible that they disperse fruits caught in their feathers. Ecology Mountain forest ecosystems have drastically changed due to human disruption such as cutting, burning and grazing, which causes fragmentation of the forest landscape. Polylepis contains some unique forms of autoecological (population ecology) and synecological relationships. Since they are located at high altitudes, they are equipped with specializations that help them withstand the harsh conditions. They are semiarid with a mean annual rainfall average between 200 and 500 mm. Tropical habitats found above 3600 m are subject to extreme diurnal changes. In midday, the temperatures may reach somewhere around 10-12 °C (or higher). This causes the soil lower than the top 30 cm to maintain a constant temperature of about 2-5 °C (or lower) all year. Thus plants must stay active throughout the year and do not become dormant. Given these harsh circumstances, the growth of trees in such areas should be impossible. The reasons for Polylepis’ ability to inhabit such conditions have been studied by many. Carl Troll, for example, considered Polylepis to be a distinct type of vegetation and he claimed one of the reasons for their survival is the presence of microclimatic phenomena such as the formation of cloud layers on slopes and along low drainage areas, prevented nighttime freezes and producing what he called \\"lower elevation\\" conditions. Another study was done by Hoch and Korner which provided that Polylepis has slow growth making it a weak competitor. Therefore, if the temperatures become warmer and more humid, Polylepis tends to lose out to the species that are more vigorous. Conservation issues Polylepis forests exist primarily as small, widely isolated fragments, which are being rapidly depleted by rural communities. Remaining Polylepis forests are used for firewood and building material and provide protection against erosion and habitats for endangered animals. In some countries, conservation and reforestation measures are underway. Human use Since Polylepis inhabits extremely high elevations, it has played an important role in the culture of various Andean Indian groups by providing building material and firewood. The woodlands themselves constitute a distinctive habitat for other organisms allowing for the creation of endemic fauna in the future. The trees are also used as decoration; planted in front of buildings and houses. As a result of people expanding their reach, Polylepis have been subjected to harvest for firewood, the clearing of woodlands for pastureland and the destruction of seedlings by domesticated animals. Few trees have been found growing on level ground and are subsequently located on \\"inaccessible\\" slopes.

When the production of the programme began, its titles and graphics were different from NRK's domestic television news bulletins. In around 2008, the programme saw a new look; while it still differed from the revamped look of the rest of NRK's bulletins at the time, the lower thirds (as well as the subtitles on NRK's broadcast) were set in the same grid of graphics that NRK's bulletins used. It also utilised the Neo Sans typeface (NRK's on-screen typeface at the time) for its presentation. In mid-2015, about a month after NRK's domestic bulletins revamped their look, Ođđasat followed with the new corporate look and theme music. It is broadcast five days a week, ten months a year. Each programme is around 15 minutes long and deals mostly with Sami issues but also has Nordic and world news, often dealing with other indigenous peoples.

In human populations, generation time typically ranges from 22 to 33 years. Historians sometimes use this to date events, by converting generations into years to obtain rough estimates of time.  Definitions and corresponding formulas  The existing definitions of generation time fall into two categories: those that treat generation time as a renewal time of the population, and those that focus on the distance between individuals of one generation and the next. Below are the three most commonly used definitions: = The time it takes for the population to grow by a factor of its net reproductive rate = The net reproductive rate R0 is the number of offspring an individual is expected to produce during its lifetime (a net reproductive rate of 1 means that the population is at its demographic equilibrium). This definition envisions the generation time as a renewal time of the population. It justifies the very simple definition used in microbiology (\\"the time it takes for the population to double\\", or doubling time) since one can consider that during the exponential phase of bacterial growth mortality is very low and as a result a bacterium is expected to be replaced by two bacteria in the next generation (the mother cell and the daughter cell). If the population dynamic is exponential with a growth rate r (i.e. n(t) ~ α.ert, where n(t) is the size of the population at time t), then this measure of the generation time is given by: :T = \\\\frac{\\\\log R_0}{r}. Indeed, \\\\textstyle T is such that n(t + T) = R0 n(t), i.e. erT = R0. = The average difference in age between parent and offspring = This definition is a measure of the distance between generations rather than a renewal time of the population. Since many demographic models are female-based (that is, they only take females into account), this definition is often expressed as a mother-daughter distance (the \\"average age of mothers at birth of their daughters\\"). However, it is also possible to define a father-son distance (average age of fathers at the birth of their sons) or not to take sex into account at all in the definition. In age- structured population models, an expression is given by: :T = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} x e^{-rx} \\\\ell(x) m(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x, where r is the growth rate of the population, ℓ(x) is the survivorship function (probability that an individual survives to age x) and m(x) the maternity function (or birth function, or age- specific fertility). For matrix population models, there is a general formula: :T = \\\\frac{ \\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{v w}}{\\\\mathbf{v F w}} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sum e_{\\\\lambda}(f_{ij})}, where λ = er is the discrete-time growth rate of the population, F = (fij) is its fertility matrix, v its reproductive value (row- vector) and w its stable stage distribution (column-vector); the \\\\textstyle e_{\\\\lambda}(f_{ij}) = \\\\frac{f_{ij}}{\\\\lambda} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\lambda}{\\\\partial f_{ij}} are the elasticities of λ to the fertilities. = The age at which members of a given cohort are expected to reproduce = This definition is very similar to the previous one but the population need not be at its stable age distribution. Moreover, it can be computed for different cohorts and thus provides more information about the generation time in the population. This measure is given by: :T = \\\\frac{\\\\int_{x=0}^{\\\\infty} x \\\\ell(x) m(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x}{\\\\int_{x=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\ell(x) m(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x}. Indeed, the numerator is the sum of the ages at which a member of the cohort reproduces, and the denominator is R0, the average number of offspring it produces.

He explored much of the coast of Western Sahara in 1435–1436 on behalf of the Portuguese prince Henry the Navigator. He would later become one of the first colonists of Terceira Island in the Azores. Background Next to nothing is known of Afonso Gonçalves Baldaia's background and origins. He is said to be the first person with that surname in Portuguese records, and thus likely to be from a family of foreign origin.Portugal; diccionario historico p.35 It is known that he served as a cup-bearer (copeiro) in the household of the Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator. First expedition In 1434 (or 1433) one of Prince Henry's household squires, Gil Eanes, sailed past Cape Bojador, the physical and psychological barrier which European sailors had long considered the non plus ultra of navigation. In the follow-up trip of 1435, Henry sent Eanes out again, this time accompanied by a second ship, a barinel under the command of Afonso Gonçalves Baldaia, with instructions to explore the coast beyond Bojador.Zurara (p.33), Barros, (p.43), Quintella, p.82. The Eanes-Baldaia trip is sometimes dated 1434, depending on whether one dates Eanes's original journey as 1433 or 1434. There is scant information on the barinel, other than that it was a new deep-hulled, two-masted sail-and-oar- powered ship, larger than Eanes's single-mast barca and said to be especially designed for coastal exploring (and thus might have already had a lateen sail in the mizzen mast). Unlike Eanes, there is no indication that Baldaia had any prior maritime experience. Eanes and Baldaia sailed as far south as Angra dos Ruivos (Garnet Bay), named after the shoals of sea robin (') they found there), some 50 leagues (250 km) south of Cape Bojador. Sailing primarily along the largely deserted coast of the Western Sahara, Eanes and Baldaia saw some traces of human presence - footprints of men and camels - but encountered no one on this expedition. * Angra dos Ruivos (Garnet Bay) Second expedition In 1436 Baldaia set off again on his barinel, this time by himself, with instructions to find and bring back a local inhabitant.Zurara (p.35), Barros (p.44), Quintella (p.82) A pair of horses were taken aboard, in case they had to give chase. Anchoring at Angra dos Cavallos (around Point Elbow), Baldaia's expedition spotted a native party at a distance and dispatched a party after it, but to no avail. Proceeding south, Baldaia discovered a coastal inlet which he named Rio do Ouro (around modern Dakhla, Western Sahara), imagining it was the mouth of the legendary 'River of Gold' spoken of by Trans-Saharan traders (probably a reference to the Senegal River, which reached deep into the Mali Empire). While anchored at Rio do Ouro, Baldaia's crew paused to undertake a hunt of the monk seals that basked on that stretch of coast, loading up the ship with a cargo of seal pelts and oil. From there, Baldaia pressed further south, crossing the Tropic of Cancer (possibly the first crossing of that latitude by a European) and reached as far as Pedra da Galé (Galha Point, a galley-shaped rock island off Cape Barbas). Finding nothing there but some abandoned fishing nets, Baldaia turned back. In all, Baldaia has sailed some 125 miles south of last year's furthest point. Disappointed at the sparse coast reported by Baldaia, Prince Henry did not send out another expedition for the next few years. It was only in 1441 that Henry finally followed up on it and sent out two ships, prototypes of the new lateen-rigged caravel - one under Antão Gonçalves to return to Rio do Ouro to undertake another seal hunt, and another under Nuno Tristão, to explore beyond Baldaia's furthest point, Pedra da Galé. * Angra dos Cavallos (Point Elbow) * Rio do Ouro * Pedra da Galé (Galha Point) Later years: Porto, Azores After Baldaia returned to Portugal, little more is heard of him. We know that at Prince Henry's request, Baldaia was appointed by King Edward of Portugal with the post of almoxarife (customs collector) in the city of Porto. We have confirmation of his continuing to hold that position as late as October 13, 1442. We hear of his successor in that position only in 1451. It is usually assumed that Afonso Gonçalves Baldaia, the Henrican explorer, is one and the same person as Afonso Gonçalves de Antona Baldaia, an Azorean colonist, although there are no documents confirming that. The latter Baldaia emerged around 1450 in connection with the Flemish colonist Jacob of Bruges, who induced the recently widowed Baldaia to move to the Azores islands, as one of the initial settlers of Terceira Island.Archivo dos Açores, 1882, vol. 4, p.11 Baldaia erected a residence and chapel in Angra do Heroísmo. In 1474, Baldaia retired to Villa da Praia, and donated his Angra lands to the Franciscan Order. His manor house would serve as a Franciscan chapter house and later a lyceum, while his chapel would be enlargened to become the church of Nossa Senhora da Guia. Baldaia the colonist died in 1481. Baldaia's descendants would continue as prominent figures in Azorean society. Afonso Gonçalves Baldaia is one of the navigators depicted in the 1960 Padrão dos Descobrimentos (Monument to the Portuguese Discoveries) in Lisbon.

The village comprises principally Lower Solva and Upper Solva. The community also includes Middle Mill and Whitchurch. Location Solva lies on the north side of St Bride's Bay, in North Pembrokeshire in the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park and on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path.Pembrokeshire Coast Path Retrieved 18 December 2011 It lies on a deep valley at the mouth of the River Solva. In the valley is Lower Solva, consisting of a long street ending at the small harbour. Most of the modern development has been in Upper Solva, on the cliff top to the west of the harbour. History Solvach Bay and harbour, 1748 Solva by engraver Henry Gastineau Solva Harbour showing Lime Kilns The rocks at the entrance to Solva Harbour made it one of the most sheltered anchorages between Fishguard and Milford Haven; it was marked on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire as Dolvath Haven. On a 1748 map it is named Solvach. Solva became the main trading centre of St Bride's Bay in the medieval period, and was important for lime burning. A prominent row of lime kilns is preserved at the harbour edge. By the end of the 18th century Solva had begun to expand, and could accommodate vessels of 500 tons, or up to 1,000 in an emergency. Some 30 vessels were registered to the port at this time, though this number reduced during the 19th century. The fading coastal trade was replaced by tourism, and the harbour became a leisure boating centre. In 1943 the RAF established an airfield, named RAF St Davids, but which now lies within Solva community. The area was the subject of an archaeological survey in 2000. The village was the location for Wales's first butterfly farm, Solva Nectarium, which opened in 1979. Geology Solva Harbour is a good example of a ria — a flooded coastal valley or inlet. Local rocks contain fossils from the Cambrian period, and the village gives its name to the Solva Group, a rock sequence. Governance An electoral ward of the same name exists. This ward extends to Brawdy and in fact some of the community was transferred there. The total population of the ward at the 2011 census was 1,877. Traditional events Every year on Easter Monday Solva hosts a Duck Race for charity. The ducks are released into the River Solva near Middle Mill and float down stream to Solva harbour. The winner is the first to cross under the footbridge in lower Solva car park. Each summer, Solva hosts a regatta which features rowing for adults and children. Solva now hosts its own festival each year being held at the end of July or Beginning of August. The festival is called 'The Edge Festival Solva' with its profits going to community based projects Amenities and attractions The local cliff coast is popular with walkers, and the classic cliff exposures of Cambrian rocks attract amateur and professional geologists. Solva Woollen Mill, located at the nearby village of Middle Mill, claims to be the oldest continuously working woollen mill in Pembrokeshire. Today the mill mostly manufactures carpets and rugs. There is a tearoom and a shop, and visitors are able to see the looms at work. Listed structures There are 37 listed structures in the community, including the church (of Whitchurch parish) of Saint Aidan.

His first appearance was in Thrilling Comics #3 (April 1940). The character is loosely based on the pulp hero created by G.T. Fleming-Roberts, who was variously known as the Ghost, the Ghost Detective, and the Green Ghost. The character was later revived by writer Alan Moore for America's Best Comics. Nedor Comics The Ghost's origin was revealed in his first appearance in Thrilling Comics. The Ghost is George Chance, an occult investigator. Years of studying the mystical arts have given him the power of levitation, astral projection, turning himself or others invisible, and other seemingly magical powers. The Ghost uses his powers to fight crime, which he does while accompanied by his wife, Betty. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, the Ghost's arch-enemy is \\"the evil (though not mad) scientist Dr. Fenton, who sends his kidnap victims (including America's greatest leaders) back to the Stone Age, and brings back monsters, villains, and women from the past. Chance also fights the super-hypnotist Dr. Volkan and Martians in a recap of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom novels.\\" The Ghost appeared as a back up feature in many issues of Thrilling Comics. His final Golden Age appearance was in issue #52 (February 1946). Grand Comics Database, last accessed 14 February 2007. America's Best Comics Alan Moore revived the Ghost, along with many other Nedor Comics characters, for his Tom Strong series. In Tom Strong #12 (June 2001), the Cavalier was revealed to have been a member of SMASH, a superhero team that had been placed in suspended animation after an alien invasion from the moon in 1969. The Ghost was one of the heroes killed during that fight; however, thanks to his mystical powers he was able to remain in this reality in his astral form. He was revived 30 years later thanks to the efforts of Tom Strong. Now calling himself the Green Ghost, Chance reunited with his wife to continue his investigation of the paranormal. The Green Ghost has since joined the reunited SMASH. Chance's widow later married science hero-turned detective Grant Halford (aka The Magnet).

Beograd: Narodna biblioteka Srbije (2007) Organizational memory can only be applied if it can be accessed. To make use of it, organizations must have effective retrieval systems for their archives and good memory recall among the individuals that make up the organization. Its importance to an organization depends upon how well individuals can apply it, a discipline known as experiential learning or evidence-based practice. In the case of individuals' memories, organizational memory's veracity is invariably compromised by the inherent limitations of human memory. Individuals' reluctance to admit to mistakes and difficulties compounds the problem. The actively encouraged flexible labor market has imposed an Alzheimer's-like corporate amnesia on organizations that creates an inability to benefit from hindsight.Corporate Amnesia, Butterworth Heinemann, 1998 Nature Organizational memory is composed of: *Prior data and information *All internally generated documentation related to the organization's activities **Intellectual property (patents, copyrights, trademarks, brands, registered design, trade secrets and processes whose ownership is granted to the company by law, licensing and partnering agreements) **Details of events, products and individuals (including relationships with people in outside organizations and professional bodies), *Relevant published reference material *Institution-created knowledge Of these, institution-created knowledge is the most important. The three main facets of organizational memory are data, information, and knowledge. It is important to understand the differences between each of these. Data is a fact depicted as a figure or a statistic, while data in context—such as in a historical time frame—is information. By contrast, knowledge is interpretative and predictive. Its deductive character allows a person with knowledge to understand the implications of information, and act accordingly. The term has been defined variously by different experts: Alvin Goldman described it as justified true belief;\\"Knowledge in a Social World\\", Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1999 Bruce Aune saw it as information in context;\\"Knowledge, Mind, and Nature: An Introduction to Theory of Knowledge and the Philosophy of Mind\\", Random House, 1967 Verna Alee defined it as experience or information that can be communicated or shared;\\"The Future of Knowledge: Increasing Prosperity through Value Networks\\", Butterworth-Heinemann, 2002 and Karl Wiig said it was a body of understanding and insights for interpreting and managing the world around us.\\"A Knowledge Model for Situation-Handling\\". Knowledge Research Institute, Inc., 2003 The word knowledge comes from the Saxon word cnaw-lec. The suffix lec has become, in modern English, -like. So, knowledge means \\"cnaw-like\\", with cnaw meaning \\"emerge\\". Its best interpretation, then, is that it is an emergent phenomenon, an extension of existing erudition. Once knowledge is documented, it reverts to being information. New knowledge—what some academics call knowledge in action—is that which is either created incrementally, accidentally, or through innovation. Incremental knowledge is the product of prior experience that is already established and recognized—so-called \\"organic learning\\" that builds one experience on another (also known as existent or historical knowledge). It is the most common form of learning. By way of a simple illustration, existent knowledge is the established awareness that, because it is hot, it is necessary to avoid sunburn and dehydration. Existent knowledge becomes new knowledge when (for example) a European on a summer vacation in Mexico, being used to wearing a cap on sunny days at home, decides to wear a sombrero. The second type of knowledge, accidental knowledge, happens unexpectedly—such as what happened in 1928 when a mold spore drifted onto a culture dish in the laboratory of Scottish research scientist Alexander Fleming while he was on a two-week holiday. It seeded a blue mold—penicillin—that killed off a harmful bacterium. The third type of knowledge, innovative knowledge, is the labor of genius, such as the work of Leonardo da Vinci—who, in the late 15th century, conceptualized cutting-edge ideas like the aeroplane, the parachute, cranes, submarines, tanks, water pumps, canals, and drills. Innovative knowledge encompasses the type of learning that leapfrogs the other types, and—in da Vinci's case—was so advanced that it had to wait hundreds of years for incremental learning to catch up. The difference between explicit and tacit knowledge In its modern understanding, knowledge is made up of explicit knowledge, sometimes called skilled knowledge; and tacit or cognitive knowledge (sometimes known as \\"coping skills\\"), a category first identified by Michael Polanyi in 1958.\\"The Tacit Dimension\\". Anchor Books, 1967 Explicit knowledge is the \\"what\\" of know- how: knowledge such as the professional or vocational skills that are recorded in manuals, textbooks, and training courses. Tacit knowledge, on the other hand, is the non-technical \\"how\\" of getting things done—what Edward de Bono, the inventor of lateral thinking, calls operacy, or the skill of action,\\"Six Action Shoes\\", Longman Higher Education, 1991 and what Peter Drucker identifies in the use of the word techne, the Greek for \\"skill\\".\\"Post- Capitalist Society\\". Butterworth Heinemann, 1993 Much of it is implicit and ambiguous, acquired largely by functional, context-specific experience. Typically existing only in the minds of individuals, tacit knowledge is normally very difficult to capture, with most organizations depending almost entirely on the explicit knowledge. This makes experiential learning, productivity gains, and competitiveness slow and expensive to acquire. In business terms, tacit knowledge is a passive misnomer for active sharing of knowledge to make an organization more effective. Training programs, for instance, cannot be limited to a source-recipient model, and should leverage mutual exchanges across generations.Harvey, J. F. (2012). Managing organizational memory with intergenerational knowledge transfer. Journal of Knowledge Management, 16, 400–417. The reality is that even though most organizational work processes are largely designed around documentation, much remains unrecorded, especially that to do with decision-making. The record often reflects the desire to gloss over disagreements and serious questions, or the desire to sell or excuse. Given the high levels of corporate amnesia in commerce and industry, some organizations are turning to new techniques to preserving their organizational memory and, in particular, their tacit knowledge. The latest capture tools to get attention are the traditional corporate history, usually produced once or twice every 100 years as a public relations medium; and oral debriefing, an augmentation of the old-fashioned prescriptive and formulaic exit interview. Instead of hagiography, organizational memory is being produced as an induction and educational tool that transmits long-term information. Oral debriefing, which concentrates on short- and medium-term memory, targets exiting and key occupant employees, recurring corporate events, and important projects in detailed testimony of participants. Both are designed to extract tacit knowledge in an easily accessible format that also generates the \\"lessons of history\\". Its permanent character also means that it does not have to be continually reproduced, just updated, and that its necessary re-interpretation alongside changing circumstances is predicated on a more reliable evidential base. How experiential learning works When it comes to experiential learning, an awareness of both the explicit and tacit components of organizational memory on their own is not generally enough to create new knowledge efficiently. As a general rule, it needs to be accompanied by a focused learning phase. Most models of experiential learning are cyclical and have three basic phases: #Awareness of an experience or problem situation; #A reflective phase within which the learner examines the OM around the experience and draws erudition from that reflection; and #A testing phase within which the new insights or learnings, having been integrated with the learner's own conceptual framework, are applied to a new problem situation or experience. The concept's starting pointArnold Kransdorff, Corporate DNA: Using Organizational Memory to improve poor decision-making', Gower Publishing 2006 is that individuals or organizations seldom learn from experience, unless the experience is assessed and then assigned its own meaning in terms of individual and/or the organization's own goals, aims, ambitions, and expectations. From these processes come insights and added meaning, which is then applied to new circumstances. The end product is better decision-making. Types Organizational memory can be subdivided into the following types: ;Professional :Reference material, documentation, tools, methodologies ;Company :Organizational structure, activities, products, participants ;Individual :Status, competencies, know-how, activities ;Project :Definition, activities, histories, results Exploring Key decisions organizations make when exploring organizational memory include: * What knowledge representation to use (stories, patterns, cases, rules, predicate logic, etc.) * Who will be the users - what are their information and learning needs? * How to ensure security and who will be granted access * How to best integrate with existing sources, stores and systems * What to do to ensure the current content is correct, applicable, timely and weeded * How to motivate experts to contribute * What to do about ephemeral insights, how to capture informal scripts (e.g. e-mail and instant-messenger posts). Most commercial knowledge management efforts have included building some form of organizational memory to capture expertise, speed learning, help the organization remember, record decision rationale, document achievements, or learn from past failures.

Manor The Domesday Book of 1086 does not list Drayton separately. At that time the land was part of the Bishop of Lincoln's estate of Dorchester. The village developed as a subsidiary of Dorchester. Upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries Dorchester Abbey surrendered its lands to the Crown and Drayton remained with the Dorchester estate. By the 18th century the Earl of Abingdon was the principal landowner. In the 19th century the family still held the largest acreage, but Trinity College, Oxford had also become a significant landowner in the parish. Most of the land of the parish was farmed on an open field system until it was enclosed in 1861.Lobel, 1962, pages 71–81 Church and chapel The Church of England parish church of Saint Leonard and Saint Catherine existed by 1146, when it was a chapel of the peculier of Dorchester Abbey. The Norman doorways in the north and south walls date from this time. In the 13th century a transeptal chapel was added on the north side and new windows were inserted in the nave, all in the Early English Gothic style. The bell tower is timber, which is unusual for Oxfordshire, (though there is a similar timber tower with a pyramid roof at Berrick Salome).L Tiller, St Helen's Church Berrick Salome, History page, Accessed 20 May 2013 The oldest bell was originally cast in 1470,Oxford Diocesan Guild of Church Bell Ringers, South Oxfordshire Branch which could also be the date that the tower was built. In the 16th century two of the nave windows were enlarged in the Perpendicular Gothic style. Stained glass of St. Leonard of Noblac in the parish church: mid-14th century, restored in 1859 In 1859, the building was drastically restored under the direction of the Gothic Revival architect G.E. Street. The external arch of the Norman south doorway was removed, all tracery was removed from the chancel windows, and a Sanctus bell turret and sundial were removed from the eastern gable of the nave. In 1884, the bell tower was strengthened, shingled and fitted with a clock. Chancel of St. Leonard & St. Catherine's parish church, showing late 12th-century chancel arch and 1894 east window by Comper & Bucknall Southeast corner of nave of parish church, showing Perpendicular Gothic window with 1894 glass by Comper & Bucknall and blocked arch of 12th century window Wild animal window in parish church A stained glass portrayal of St Leonard in the lancet window in the north wall of the chancel originates from the middle of the 14th century, but most of the present pieces of its glass date from the 1859 restoration. Ninian Comper and William Bucknall made the stained glass in the three-light east window of the chancel and two-light south-east window of the nave in 1894. The latter is based on a painting by the 15th century Early Netherlandish painter Dirk Bouts in St. Peter's Church, Leuven in Flanders. In 1552 St. Leonard's was recorded as having three bells. In 1884 when the tower was strengthened, Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry recast the three original bells and cast three new ones to make the present ring of six. SS Leonard & Catherine is now a member of the Dorchester Team Ministry. The Old Rectory, which was sold into private ownership after the Second World War, was designed by the architect John Billing and built in 1862 in the Victorian Gothic style for the new rector the Reverend Arthur Williams and his large family. The first Methodist chapel in Drayton is said to have been built in 1814. It was replaced with a new building on a different site in 1879. The chapel was still used for worship in 1958. War Memorial Drayton St Leonard War Memorial The village War Memorial is a sandstone cross, designed by Sir Aston Webb, architect of many well-known buildings including Buckingham Palace and Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. It was unveiled by Major General Sir Robert Fanshawe KCB, DSO in 1923. The memorial was restored with funds provided by the War Memorials Trust in 2015. Secular buildings The oldest secular building in Drayton is a timber-framed barn. Its date is unknown but it is thought to be about 1400. There are at least 15 houses and cottages dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, several of which are thatched. The village has one public house, the Catherine Wheel. Licensing records show that it was a public house by 1841. For a time the village had a second public house, the Three Pigeons. The building is now a private house but retains its pub name. For many years Morrells of Oxford controlled the Catherine Wheel but it is now a free house. The present structure dates from the 1930s, and replaced an earlier building that was destroyed by fire. A National School was completed and opened next to the parish church in 1855. In 1925 it was reorganised as a junior school, with older pupils being schooled in Dorchester. The school was closed in 1947 and is now the village hall. Amenities * The village has a small private airstrip.

Note the extremely uniform distribution of the orbit. The standard map (also known as the Chirikov–Taylor map or as the Chirikov standard map) is an area- preserving chaotic map from a square with side 2\\\\pi onto itself. It is constructed by a Poincaré's surface of section of the kicked rotator, and is defined by: :p_{n+1} = p_n + K \\\\sin(\\\\theta_n) :\\\\theta_{n+1} = \\\\theta_n + p_{n+1} where p_n and \\\\theta_n are taken modulo 2\\\\pi. The properties of chaos of the standard map were established by Boris Chirikov in 1969. Physical model This map describes the Poincaré's surface of section of the motion of a simple mechanical system known as the kicked rotator. The kicked rotator consists of a stick that is free of the gravitational force, which can rotate frictionlessly in a plane around an axis located in one of its tips, and which is periodically kicked on the other tip. The standard map is a surface of section applied by a stroboscopic projection on the variables of the kicked rotator. The variables \\\\theta_n and p_n respectively determine the angular position of the stick and its angular momentum after the n-th kick. The constant K measures the intensity of the kicks on the kicked rotator. The kicked rotator approximates systems studied in the fields of mechanics of particles, accelerator physics, plasma physics, and solid state physics. For example, circular particle accelerators accelerate particles by applying periodic kicks, as they circulate in the beam tube. Thus, the structure of the beam can be approximated by the kicked rotor. However, this map is interesting from a fundamental point of view in physics and mathematics because it is a very simple model of a conservative system that displays Hamiltonian chaos. It is therefore useful to study the development of chaos in this kind of system. Main properties For K=0 the map is linear and only periodic and quasiperiodic orbits are possible. When plotted in phase space (the θ-p plane), periodic orbits appear as closed curves, and quasiperiodic orbits as necklaces of closed curves whose centers lie in another larger closed curve. Which type of orbit is observed depends on the map's initial conditions. Nonlinearity of the map increases with K, and with it the possibility to observe chaotic dynamics for appropriate initial conditions. This is illustrated in the figure, which displays a collection of different orbits allowed to the standard map for various values of K > 0. All the orbits shown are periodic or quasiperiodic, with the exception of the green one that is chaotic and develops in a large region of phase space as an apparently random set of points. Particularly remarkable is the extreme uniformity of the distribution in the chaotic region, although this can be deceptive: even within the chaotic regions, there are an infinite number of diminishingly small islands that are never visited during iteration, as shown in the close- up. Circle map The standard map is related to the circle map, which has a single, similar iterated equation: :\\\\theta_{n+1} = \\\\theta_n + \\\\Omega - K \\\\sin(\\\\theta_n) as compared to :\\\\theta_{n+1} = \\\\theta_n + p_n + K \\\\sin(\\\\theta_n) :p_{n+1} = \\\\theta_{n+1} - \\\\theta_{n} for the standard map, the equations reordered to emphasize similarity.

Emilio Zavattini (March 14, 1927 – January 9, 2007) was an Italian particle physicist. Biography He was born in Rimini, Italy and enrolled in the University of Rome La Sapienza as a physics student in 1950 and earned his doctorate in 1954. Zavattini joined CERN in 1955 and remained a staff member until he retired in 1992. Early in this period he made a short post-doctoral visit to Nevis Laboratory at Columbia University where he worked with Leon Lederman. After retirement, he held a position as a professor at the University of Trieste from 1988–1999. Zavattini is known for the muon g-2 experiment and the PVLAS experiment at the INFN Laboratory in Legnaro (Padua, Italy). He made contributions within the fields of strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions—especially using muons—both at CERN and at other European and U.S. laboratories. In later years his studies focused on a better understanding of the structure of vacuum. He was a member of the Accademia dei Lincei. Zavattini died at the age of 79 of a heart attack.

At some time after this, he moved to Bordesley Green near Birmingham in England, presumably to promote his patent. He was a prolific inventor, taking out numerous patents for methods of button making, nail making, metal working, smelting iron, spinning and other branches of engineering. In 1824 he patented a printing machine which positioned the paper sheets more accurately. He turned his attention to steam engines, with a patent in 1829 for marine engines and associated equipment, and another in 1830 for an improved furnace. He patented his first steam carriage in 1832. This does not appear to have been built, but a further patent in 1835 led to the formation of the London and Birmingham Steam Carriage Company. The company prospectus describes their vehicle of 60 hp, capable of carrying a load of 15 tons at a rate of 15 miles an hour. steam coach on the road The Science Museum has an engraving by Josiah Allen Science and Society Picture Library - Search which shows it as a large three- wheeled vehicle with passenger compartments front and rear similar to conventional stagecoach bodies, with seating on top, and the driver mounted high at the front operating a tiller for steering.

Although some accounts suggest that it operated on a daily basis between London and Birmingham, Prosser Prosser, R.B.

Although a number of steam powered coaches were tried between 1820 and 1840, they were extremely unpopular. With various impediments from excessive tolls on the turnpikes to virtual sabotage, prospective passengers were unnerved by being so close to the boiler. In the end, the railway, with its smooth running track and increasing speed, put an end to them.

It was a structure with a puncheon floor and a roof of clapboards with eight-poles laid across to keep them on. The windows were made by cutting out a log for several feet on each side of the house and putting greased paper in the opening. One end of the house was almost entirely appropriated for a fireplace. The seats consisted of split slabs supported by wooden pins. In this manner the school houses were built for a number of years. A school was opened in a log cabin about a mile north of where Andersonville now stands, in 1815 or 1816, the teacher being a man by the name of Perkins. It was afterwards held in a school house on the Inghams’ farm. East of the village. A hewed log house was erected a short distance above Andersonville in 1823, and was used until the brick house in the village was erected. A school house was built at an early date where the Union Church now stands, and another where the upper part of the basin was, in 1814 or 1815, Mr. Young and Mr. Lowery were the teachers. One of the earliest schools was opened on the farm of Thomas Withgott in which Charles McCrea was one of the first teachers. The first school in the Cook neighborhood was kept in a six- cornered, round log school house, as early as 1805 or 1806. Ebeneezer Everts was one of the first school teachers there, teaching several terms. The first school organized under the School Law was the Quaker School, then kept in a hewed log school house. The one room school houses of Union and Scioto townships were abandoned at the end of the school year 1935-1936, upon the recommendation of the State Department of Education. A new district was created using the name Union-Scioto Rural School. The school became known as “Unioto”, a contractive term taken from Union and Scioto. A tax levy of 3 ½ mils voted by the district evolved the sum of $50,000 which was matched by another $50,000 from the Federal government under the Public Works Administration and numbered as Project M OH 1021 R. The building site was purchased from Mr. George Garrison, on Egypt Pike, for the sum of $2,000. Construction was started in February 1936, and the building was occupied September 23 of the same year. DeVoss and Donaldson were the architects, McCabe and Proctor were the contractors. It was thought that colors of purple and gold were adopted at the suggestion of one of the board members whose Chillicothe class colors were purple and gold. The mascot name of “The Shermans” was later adopted when Supt. McMahon, former general in the United States Army, was superintendent of the Unioto School. Since Unioto lies just opposite the former site of World War I Camp Sherman, the suggestion of “The Shermans” was unanimously accepted by the student body. The Tank emblem became likewise a fitting symbol for the school. In May 1937, the Unioto High School graduated its first senior class of eight members.

Afurada's people seem to be very devoted to St. Peter and every year there is a religious holiday in St. Peter's name (on 29 June), where people make processions, pray, and party throughout the night. It is customary for people to eat sardines in that week, baked with the typical Broa de Avintes, a type of corn bread made in the nearby village of Avintes. There is plenty of fireworks too. During religious processions people carry the images of saints, sometimes in real size, for other people to worship and make offerings to the saints.

In 1086 Warborough was part of the large royal estate of Benson.Mileson: Manors and Other Estates The Church of England parish church of Saint Laurence was originally a chapel of the parish of Benson. There is a record of the Empress Matilda giving the benefice of Benson, including chapels at Nettlebed and Warborough, to the Augustinian Abbey at nearby Dorchester in about 1140, and for most of the Middle Ages Warborough was regarded as part of the parish of Dorchester. It remained part of Dorchester peculiar until 1847, but functioned largely as an independent parish from the Middle Ages.Mileson: Religious History Perhaps the oldest item in the church is the font, which dates from late in the 12th century. The chancel has Decorated Gothic features from the early part of the 13th century, including the east window and one of the windows on the south side. The other windows of the chancel are later Perpendicular Gothic additions. The nave and south transept are Perpendicular features from the 14th century, although the transept arch and window are Decorated. The Gothic Revival architects G.F. Bodley and Thomas Garner restored the chancel in 1881. The Perpendicular Gothic windows in the nave are likewise Victorian. The bell-tower was rebuilt in 1666. Its two oldest bells were cast in 1618, and two more date from 1675. It had a ring of six bells, but in 1955 two new bells were cast and hung increasing the ring to eight.Oxford Diocesan Guild of Church Bell Ringers, South Oxfordshire Branch: Warborough.

History =Roads and ford= At various times the river crossing at Shillingford has been a ford, a ferry or a bridge. The present bridge was built in 1827, replacing a previous one built in 1767. Neighbouring Wharf Road has a slipway, boathouse and 12 listed buildings (at Grade II, for their age predominantly), about half of its total.

It was to compete with the DC-2 and Lockheed Super Electra. Design and development In mid-1930s the Polish Ministry of Communication ordered a development of an own passenger plane for LOT Polish Airlines, using imported airliners so far, mostly Lockheed Model 10 Electra and DC-2. The plane was designed in the state factory Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze under direction of Wsiewołod Jakimiuk in 1936-1937. The prototype was flown on March 12, 1938 by Bolesław Orliński. The aircraft was designated PZL.44 Wicher. In December 1938 it was given to LOT for evaluation, with registration SP-BPJ. Initially LOT airlines ordered 10 PZL.44s but high cost of a single plane and delays in development were reasons for decreasing order to 4, then for cancelling it in 1939. LOT bought a batch of 10 cheaper Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra in 1938 and 1939 instead. Wicher was the first modern airliner designed in Poland. Its construction was very modern, but it is estimated, that the whole program was too ambitious, because a development of an own passenger plane, without much hope of export, was unprofitable. Moreover, LOT airlines found operation features of well-proven Lockheed Super Electra more satisfactory. Lockheed offered a possibility of licence production as well. Besides, the Wicher development caused delays in development of new fighter aircraft, like PZL.50 Jastrząb, that were more needed in an advent of the war. =Description= Twin-engine low-wing cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction, metal covered (with Alclad sheet).

Biography =Early life and ordination= Bishop Daily was born to John F. and Mary McBride (née Vose) Daily, a member of an established New England family, in Belmont, Massachusetts in 1927. Upon completion of his studies, first at Boston College and later at St. John's Seminary in Brighton, Massachusetts, he was ordained as a priest of the Archdiocese of Boston in 1952 by Richard Cardinal Cushing at Boston's Cathedral of the Holy Cross. Following ordination, he was assigned as curate for St. Ann's church in Wollaston, Quincy. He remained in that post through the rest of that decade. =Missionary in Peru= In 1960, Bishop Daily joined the Missionary Society of St. James the Apostle and moved to the Limatambo area of Cusco, Peru. He spent five years as a missionary in Peru. =Return to Boston= After returning to Boston, he was assigned again to St. Ann's, where he served as assistant pastor until 1971. He was appointed to the position of secretary to Cardinal Humberto Sousa Medeiros and later Vicar for Temporalities. In 1975, he was consecrated as an auxiliary bishop in the Archdiocese of Boston and in 1976 was appointed vicar general of the archdiocese. Because of his fluency in Spanish, he was given special duties regarding the Spanish-speaking members of the archdiocese. =Bishop of Palm Beach= On July 17, 1984, just four months after Bernard Law was installed as Archbishop of Boston, Bishop Daily was appointed the first bishop of the new Diocese of Palm Beach, Florida. Among his most noteworthy actions were his leading of pro-life prayer vigils at local abortion clinics. From 1987 to 2005, Bishop Daily also served as the Supreme Chaplain of the Knights of Columbus. =Bishop of Brooklyn= In 1990, Bishop Daily was installed as the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Brooklyn, succeeding Bishop Francis J. Mugavero. Shortly after his installation, he responded to a reporter's question by stating that the then-Governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, would not be welcomed as a speaker in the diocese's parishes because of Cuomo's pro- choice position on abortion, which was directly at odds with Catholic teaching. =Resignation and retirement= On August 1, 2003, Daily announced his resignation as a bishop had finally been accepted by the Vatican, ten months after he had submitted a letter of resignation upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75. Bishop Daily was the Bishop Emeritus of Brooklyn and was a member of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America and a member of the boards of the Society of St. James the Apostle in Boston and the National Catholic Office for Persons with Disabilities in Washington, D.C. = Death = Daily died on May 15, 2017 at the Bishop Mugavero Residence in Douglaston, Queens.

The island of Great Britain, along with the rest of the archipelago known as the British Isles, has a largely temperate climate. It contains a relatively small fraction of the world's wildlife. The biota was severely diminished in the last Ice Age, and shortly (in geological terms) thereafter was separated from the continent by the English Channel's formation. Since then, humans have hunted the most dangerous forms (the wolf, the brown bear and the wild boar) to extinction, though domesticated forms such as the dog and the pig remain. The wild boar has subsequently been reintroduced as a meat animal.Clarke et al. 1980, p. 86. Overview In most of Great Britain there is a temperate climate which receives high levels of precipitation and medium levels of sunlight. Further northwards, the climate becomes colder and coniferous forests appear replacing the largely deciduous forests of the south. There are a few variations in the generally temperate British climate, with some areas of subarctic conditions in areas such as the Scottish Highlands and Teesdale, and even sub-tropical in the Isles of Scilly. The seasonal changes that occur across the archipelago mean that plants have to cope with many changes linked to levels of sunlight, rainfall and temperature, as well as the risk of snow and frost during the winter. Since the mid eighteenth century, Great Britain has gone through industrialisation and increasing urbanisation. A DEFRA study from 2006 suggested that 100 species have become extinct in the UK during the 20th century, about 100 times the background extinction rate.DEFRA, 2006 This has had a major impact on indigenous animal populations. Song birds in particular are becoming scarcer and habitat loss has affected larger mammalian species. Some species have however adapted to the expanding urban environment, particularly the red fox, which is the most successful urban mammal after the brown rat, and other animals such as common wood pigeon. Invertebrates =Molluscs= There are 220 species of non-marine molluscs that have been recorded as living in the wild in Britain. Two of them (Fruticicola fruticum and Cernuella neglecta) are locally extinct. In addition there are 14 gastropod species that live only in greenhouses. =Insects= =Arachnids= Vertebrates =Amphibians= The species of amphibian native to Britain are the great crested newt, smooth newt, palmate newt, common toad, natterjack toad, common frog and the pool frog. Several other species have become naturalised. =Reptiles= Like many temperate areas, Great Britain exhibits a relative lack of snakes, with the European adder being the only venomous snake to be found there. The other notable snakes found in Great Britain are the grass snake and the smooth snake. Great Britain has three native breeds of lizard: slowworms, sand lizards and viviparous lizards. There are also turtles, such as leatherback turtles to be found in the Irish Sea, although these are rarely seen by the public. Other reptile species exist but are not native: aesculapian snake, wall lizard and the green lizard. =Birds= A Long eared owl in the UK. In general the avifauna of Britain is similar to that of Europe, consisting largely of Palaearctic species. As an island, it has fewer breeding species than continental Europe, with some species, like crested lark, breeding as close as northern France, yet unable to colonise Britain. The mild winters mean that many species that cannot cope with harsher conditions can winter in Britain, and also that there is a large influx of wintering birds from the continent or beyond. There are about 250 species regularly recorded in Great Britain, and another 350 that occur with varying degrees of rarity. = Mammals = Large mammals are not particularly numerous in Great Britain. Many of the bigger species, such as the grey wolf and the brown bear, were hunted to extinction many centuries ago. However, in recent times some of these large mammals have been tentatively reintroduced to some areas of mainland Britain. The largest wild mammals that remain in Britain today are predominantly members of the deer family. The red deer is the largest native wild mammal species, and is common throughout England, Scotland and Wales. The largest native mammal is the Shire Horse. The other indigenous species is the roe deer. The common fallow deer is in fact not native to Britain, having been brought over from France by the Normans in the late 11th century. It has become well established.The Fallow Deer Project, University of Nottingham The sika deer is another small species of deer which is not indigenous, originating from Japan. It is widespread and expanding in Scotland from west to east, with a strong population in Peeblesshire. Bands of sika exist across the north and south of England though the species is absent in Wales. A European hedgehog. There are also several species of insectivore found in Britain. The hedgehog is probably the most widely known as it is a regular visitor to urban gardens. The mole is also widely recognised and its subterranean lifestyle causes much damage to garden lawns. Shrews are also fairly common, and the smallest, the pygmy shrew, is one of the smallest mammals in the world. There are also seventeen species of bat found in Britain: the pipistrelle is the smallest and the most common. Rodents are also numerous across Britain, particularly the brown rat which is by far the most abundant urban mammal after humans. Some however, are becoming increasingly rare. Habitat destruction has led to a decrease in the population of dormice and bank voles found in Britain. Due to the introduction of the North American grey squirrel, the red squirrel had become largely extinct in England and Wales, with the last populations existing in parts of North West England and on the Isle of Wight. European rabbit and European hare were introduced in Roman times, while the indigenous mountain hare remains only in Scotland and a small re-introduced population in Derbyshire. There are a variety of carnivores, especially from the weasel family (ranging in size from the weasel, stoat and European polecat to the European badger, pine marten, recently introduced mink and semiaquatic otter). In the absence of the locally extinct grey wolf and brown bear the largest carnivores are the badger, red fox, the adaptability and opportunism of which has allowed it to proliferate in the urban environment, and the European wildcat whose elusiveness has caused some confusion over population numbers, and is believed to be highly endangered, partly by hybridisation with the domestic cat. Various species of seal and dolphin are found seasonally on British shores and coastlines, along with harbour porpoises, orcas, and many other sea mammals. =Fish= Great Britain has about forty species of native freshwater fish, of which the largest is the salmon. The saltwater fish include some quite dangerous species such as sharks, though shark attacks are extremely rare in the archipelago.

It was directed and produced by Pablo Trapero. The screenplay was a joint effort of Nicolas Gueilburt, Ricardo Ragendorfer, Dodi Shoeuer, Pablo Trapero, and actor Daniel Valenzuela, and partly funded by INCAA. It features Jorge Román, Mimí Ardú, among others.. The movie deals with the corruption of the Bonaerense Police in the Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, and the lives of those involved in it. Plot Zapa (Jorge Román) is a locksmith apprentice living the simple life in Corrientes with his family. After the locksmith Polaco (Hugo Anganuzzi) pulls a job on a safe and uses him as a scapegoat, Zapa is made to pay for the crime by serving in the Buenos Aires police jail, which is pictured as notoriously corrupt. This takes him to the La Matanza barrio in Greater Buenos Aires. Here, Zapa is taken in as the protegé of his superior Gallo (Darío Levy) and begins to climb the ladder of corruption. At the same time he has an affair with instructor Mabel (Mimí Ardú). His journey through the political underworld as he frames and bribes ultimately takes him to the edge of innocence, and a final confrontation with El Polaco.

The picture was screened at various film festivals, including: the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, Czech Republic; the Toronto International Film Festival, Canada; the Chicago International Film Festival, United States; the Bergen International Film Festival, Norway; the Stockholm International Film, Sweden; and others. Reception =Critical response= New York Times film critic Stephen Holden lauded the film and wrote, \\"There are no crusading moralists to clean up the mess in El Bonaerense, Pablo Trapero's grim, dispassionate drama of police corruption, set mostly in contemporary Buenos Aires. This powerful sweat-stained swatch of Argentine neo-realism, filmed in harsh high contrast that throws its characters' faces into deep shadow, follows the initiation of Zapa (Jorge Román), a naïve police recruit, into a labyrinth of sleaze...[the film] is all the more disturbing for refusing to act as an exposé. It just throws up its hands and says that this is the way it is. And its pointed detachment lends certain scenes an almost farcical sense of the absurd.\\"Holden, Stephen.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 102. Archaeology Archaeological work in the grounds of Newington House in the early 1980s and the latter half of the 2000s revealed extensive medieval occupation including at least one smithy. Some residual ancient Roman pottery was recovered from medieval pits, indicating that there may have been a Roman farm or similar in the area. Newington is about from the Roman town of Dorchester on Thames. The earliest in situ remains are evidence for plots from after the Norman conquest of England, dating from the late 11th and early 12th centuries. These may have been agricultural enclosures, such as paddocks, but were probably laid out as house-plots for tenants. By the early 12th century it seems that a smithy was built within one of the plots, followed in the 13th century by a larger smithy built on stone footings. This smithy was in use until the 14th century when it fell into disuse. Whether smithing was carried out elsewhere in Newington is still unknown, but by the 15th century the plot where the smithy formerly existed had been dug over and used for the disposal of rubbish. There is a 14th-century reference to Andrew le Smith from the attached hamlet of Brightwell; probably Britwell Prior. Manor The Domesday Book valued Neutone (Newington) at £11 in the reign of King Edward the Confessor (1042–66) and £15 in 1086. Early in the 11th century, a manor in the northern part of Berrick was joined to the parish of Newington. > [The manor] \\"fell into the hands of King Canute 'through forfeiture of a > certain thegn'. It was begged of the King by his wife, Emma, and she passed > it to the monks of Canterbury. This transaction swelled the parish of > Newington which was a peculiar of the Archbishop of Canterbury\\". The manor came to be called Berrick Prior, meaning the corn farm belonging to the Prior of Canterbury. As part of Newington, Berrick Prior \\"acquired an administrative status quite different from that of Berrick Salome, for even in the present [twentieth] century directories referred to it as 'the liberty of Berrick Prior' which reflected a sometime exemption from the jurisdiction of the Sheriff of Oxfordshire.\\" This status ended in 1993 when a local reorganisation of boundaries returned Berrick Prior to Berrick Salome parish. Grade II* listed wrought iron gates After Parliament passed an Inclosure Act for lands in the liberties of Berrick Prior and Newington and Holcombe, an inclosure award was made on 30 March 1815. The current Manor House was built about 1664, and a third storey and a Corinthian porch were added to it in about 1777. The former Rectory, now Beauforest House, is a Georgian house of five bays built about 1774. It is a Grade II* listed building. Parish church The Church of England parish church of Saint GilesSt Giles Church, Newington, Oxfordshire was built in the 12th century, its transepts were added about 1200 and the west tower and spire were added early in the 14th century. The building is Grade I listed. The tower has a ring of four bells. Roger Landen of Wokingham, Berkshire cast the second bell in about 1450. Robert Eldridge of Wokingham cast the treble bell in 1592. Henry I Knight of Reading, Berkshire cast the tenor bell in 1608. Abraham II Rudhall of Gloucester cast the third bell in 1719. For technical reasons the bells are currently unringable. St Giles' has also a Sanctus bell that Ellis I Knight of Reading cast in 1639. Gilbert Sheldon held the living of the parish for a time in the 17th century. Sheldon also simultaneously held the livings of Hackney, Ickford, Buckinghamshire and Oddington, Oxfordshire. After the Restoration of the Monarchy, Sheldon was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury in 1663.

It is located between the Vestfjorden and the Norwegian Sea. The island of Vestvågøya lies to the southwest and the large island of Hinnøya to the northeast. In 2017, island had about 9,000 residents. Most of the island is part of Vågan Municipality, while the northeastern part belongs to Hadsel Municipality. The main town on the island is Svolvær. Austvågøya is popular among mountain climbers. The famous Trollfjord is located in the eastern part of the island. Austvågøya is connected by the European route E10 highway to the neighboring island of Hinnøya to the east using the Raftsund Bridge and to the island of Gimsøya to the west using the Gimsøystraumen Bridge. Geography The island is long in the east to west direction and wide from the north to south. The islands surrounding Austvågøya include Gimsøya and Vestvågøya to the west, Skrova, Litlmolla, and Stormolla to the south, Hinnøya to the east, and Hadseløya to the north. Austvågøya is largely a mountain massif, with lowland almost exclusively at the coastal beaches, the brim of lowland around the coast. The highest mountain on the island (and in all of Lofoten) is the tall Higravstinden, located on the eastern part of the island. Svartsundtindan (), Trolltindan (), and Olsanestind () are also in the eastern part, while the famous Vågakallen () looms over the village of Henningsvær in the southwestern part.

The ornament almost always incorporates a base and many fairings have a caption describing the scene or making some point inscribed on that base. Although the majority of fairings are simply decorative, they were occasionally made in the form of pinboxes, matchstrikers or holders for watches or small mirrors. Some fairings were made in pairs, for example, \\"Grandpapa - Grandma\\", two separate statuettes of a small boy and girl, each dressed in adults' clothing. China fairings are so named because they were given away as prizes at fairs in the Victorian era, in much the same way that we would win a coconut at a fair today, although some were manufactured simply for sale. They first started appearing in the middle of the nineteenth century and remained popular until the start of the First World War. Genuine fairings are now keenly sought by serious collectors. In the United Kingdom they can range in price from a few pounds for the more common ones (such as \\"Last in bed to put out the light\\") to several hundred pounds for the rarer ones, the most keenly sought being the five fairings the Vienna series (uncaptioned, but characterised by a gold band around the base). As with any antique, the value of a fairing depends on its condition - they are particularly delicate and damage of any sort can seriously reduce their value - and, in the case of fairings that are paired, whether they are offered singly or with their partners. Most fairings were manufactured in Germany by Conta and Boehme. This company developed a mass production method that no other company could match, thereby achieving an advantage over other firms. Captions The subject matter that inspired fairings varies widely and provides an interesting insight into the popular culture of the Victorian era. Popular songs and music hall numbers inspire some of them, such as \\"Jenny Jones and Ned Morgan\\" and \\"Champagne Charlie is my name\\". Others commemorate notable people or buildings such as Ladies of Llangollen (relating to the scandalous affair of Lady Eleanor Butler and Lady Sarah Ponsonby) or \\"The Model of Laxey\\" (the Laxey Wheel on the Isle of Mann, the largest metal water wheel in the world). The captions on some fairings are a little more obscure, such as \\"How's business?\\" (on one fairing) and \\"Slack!\\" (on its partner). These were inspired by the same design on a drinking cup from the period. Beds feature heavily in the domestic scenes, so much so that fairings were once known as \\"bedpieces\\". The captions on these fairings often indicate a cynical attitude to marriage, for example \\"When a man is married his troubles begin\\" on a fairing showing a man nursing a crying baby. Another shows a man cowering from his wife with the caption \\"Home from the club he fears the storm.\\" Many, on the other hand, are simply charming, for example \\"God Save the Queen\\" (a family gathered round a piano) or \\"Which is prettiest?\\" (three beautiful little girls). Some captions are politically inspired, such as \\"English neutrality 1870 Attending the sick and the wounded\\", commemorating the fact that Britain did not become involved in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. Others are moralistic e.g. \\"Seeing him home\\" showing a drunk being escorted home by a spirit and the grim reaper, both dressed as undertakers. Occasionally fairings descend into the downright rude, such as \\"The early bird catches the worm\\", in which a goose pecks at what it thinks is a worm, only to cause pain to a young lad who is relieving himself. Another one is \\"Review\\" in which two lecherous men admire a scantily clad woman emerging from bathing. The seven categories Part of the collection of china fairings held by Tudor House and Garden in Southampton Authors generally classify fairings into seven categories based on their general value and rarity. Category A contains the most common fairings, and the categories go up through B, C, D, E, F and finally X for the rarest and most valuable fairings. Books on fairings sometimes assign price ranges to these categories, but these are relied on less and less as time goes by. After all, when fairings are traded the price agreed upon depends on how keenly each party wants the trade. The categories are still retained as a convenient way of classifying fairings but are no longer relied upon for setting prices. Dating * Earlier Fairings some times had the 4 digit numbers incised on the base, these will usually be found without Conta & Boehme's shield mark. The shield/dagger mark was not used before 1840-45 (as per Vogels book ) * Fairings from 1850-1860 were generally larger than those that followed. * From the 1890s the shield mark may be printed or the \\"Made in Germany\\" mark could be present, but just to confuse you even further, no 4 digit impressed or incised numbers may be present. It is generally assumed that these are fakes but according to my research this is not necessarily the case. * circa 1890 the shield was printed on base. * after 1890 the colours of Conta & Boehme Fairings became brighter and much more colourful. * 1891 made in Germany' was used as all ceramics had to indicate country of manufacture. * 1914 fairings were not made. * A bicycle indicates that a piece is later than 1867. Some fairings have themes based on popular music or prints, these may be dated easily. Dating Non Conta & Boehme Fairings * Most of the other manufactures, typically of inferior fairings, started circa 1890 onwards until 1914. * Use dating methods that you would normally use to date non-fairings porcelain. * Most 'modern' reproductions were produced mid/late-20th century. Reproductions Reproductions were made as early as the first few decades of the twentieth century. However, serious fairing collectors are not interested in them, and in the United Kingdom they are generally only worth a few pounds at most. It takes an experienced eye to tell a reproduction from the genuine article, but there are one or two tell- tale signs that you can use to spot the more obvious ones. * Reproductions often have two small holes, roughly the size of a fingernail, on the underside. * Many fairings have a four-digit number printed on their base, with each number defining a particular design. Any number starting with the digits \\"18\\" indicates a reproduction. * Reproductions generally seem cheap and shoddy, with excessively gaudy colours and poor gilding if any. The caption may be printed in a sloppy fashion, such as sloping downwards in upper case letters. * Although several captions are shared among different genuine fairings, and the same design often appears with different captions, there are a few captions, such as \\"Loose pins\\" that are not genuine. * Some unscrupulous traders have been known to apply a patina of grime to a reproduction to make it appear older than it is.

Nedor Comics Pyroman is the secret identity of research student, Dick Martin. Due to his work with high voltage electricity, his body develops the ability to store electrical current. He discovers this ability after he's framed for murder by a saboteur, and sentenced to die in the electric chair. After clearing his name, he decides to use his powers to fight crime. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"Pyroman fights evil men like Venomi and his Black Boas, Schneubel (who uses a weapon to recreate Mars' environment in America), Dr. Fosfor and his semi-sentient living flame, and would-be world-conqueror Dr. Zucca and his city-destroying Tornado.\\" Pyroman appeared in numerous Nedor Comics titles during the 1940s. His last Golden Age Appearance was in America's Best Comics (no relation to the DC Comics imprint) #29 (January 1949). Many of his cover appearances were drawn by artist Alex Schomburg. AC Comics Pyroman was one of the many Nedor Comics' characters revived by AC comics in the late 1990s. AC Comics reprinted Startling Comics #23 as Golden- Age Men of Mystery #9 (August 1998). Grand Comics Database, last accessed 14 February 2007 His sole original appearance was in a new story written for All- Hero Retro Comics Annual #1 (1998). America's Best Comics Alan Moore used Pyroman, along with many other Nedor Comics characters, for his Tom Strong series. In Tom Strong #12 (June 2001), Pyroman was revealed to have been a member of SMASH, a superhero team that had been placed in suspended animation after an alien invasion from the moon in 1969 and revived 30 years later thanks to the efforts of Tom Strong. SMASH disbanded shortly thereafter. When SMASH reformed three years later, Pyroman rejoined the team. Dynamite Entertainment In 2007, Pyroman was again one of several Golden Age characters used, this time in Dynamite Entertainment's Project Superpowers written by Jim Krueger and drawn by Alex Ross.

Suspension was originally from the Vauxhall Viva or Magnum and there was a Chevette based version as well. Carburettors were usually twin 40 Webers or Dell'Ortos as the low bonnet made fitting the standard downdraft carb difficult. The very strong steel spaceframe chassis was covered by a non stressed fiberglass body with the flip front bonnet giving excellent access to the engine bay. Slightly larger and heavier than the later Striker it had a small boot accessible via the rear of the cockpit so if a full roll cage was fitted little could be carried. The front suspension was twin wishbones without an anti roll bar with a live rear axle with a 4-point location system. This worked surprisingly well due to the low centre of gravity. The later Strikers had a 5-point location system which improved handling. Production Later production was taken over by Robbley Motors but this was short lived. Front engined rear wheel drive cars such as this are becoming rarer due to a shortage of suitable donor vehicles.

Equine nutrition is the feeding of horses, ponies, mules, donkeys, and other equines. Correct and balanced nutrition is a critical component of proper horse care. Horses are non-ruminant herbivores of a type known as a \\"hindgut fermenter.\\" Horses have only one stomach, as do humans. However, unlike humans, they also need to digest plant fiber (largely cellulose) that comes from grass or hay. Ruminants like cattle are foregut fermenters, and digest fiber in plant matter by use of a multi-chambered stomach, whereas horses use microbial fermentation in a part of the digestive system known as the cecum (or caecum) to break down the cellulose. Williams, Carey A., Ph.D., Extension Specialist. \\"The Basics of Equine Nutrition\\" from FS #038, Equine Science Center, Rutgers University, Revised: April 2004. Web site accessed February 9, 2007 In practical terms, horses prefer to eat small amounts of food steadily throughout the day, as they do in nature when grazing on pasture lands.\\"Horse Nutrition - Frequency.\\" Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University. Web site accessed February 9, 2007. Although this is not always possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, it is important to remember the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities. The digestive system of the horse is somewhat delicate. Horses are unable to regurgitate food, except from the esophagus. Thus, if they overeat or eat something poisonous, vomiting is not an option.Giffen, James M. and Tom Gore. Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook., 2nd ed. New York:Howell Book House, 1989, 1998. They also have a long, complex large intestine and a balance of beneficial microbes in their cecum that can be upset by rapid changes in feed. Because of these factors, they are very susceptible to colic, which is a leading cause of death in horses.\\"Colic in Horses\\" ASC-128, Cooperative Extension Service, University of Kentucky, College of Agriculture, Equine Section, Department of Animal Sciences. web site accessed March 14, 2007 Therefore, horses require clean, high-quality feed, provided at regular intervals, plus water and may become ill if subjected to abrupt changes in their diets.March, Linda. \\"Feeding Your Horse To Avoid Problems,\\" from University of Illinois, College of Veterinary Medicine. Web site accessed February 16, 2007 Horses are also sensitive to molds and toxins. For this reason, they must never be fed contaminated fermentable materials such as lawn clippings.A. Cirelli, Jr. and B. Cloud. \\"Suburban Horse Keeping.\\" (PDF) Fact Sheet: 94-09, Cooperative Extension Service, University of Nevada, Reno. Web site accessed July 4, 2009. Fermented silage or \\"haylage\\" is fed to horses in some places; however, contamination or failure of the fermentation process that allows any mold or spoilage may be toxic.\\"Horse Nutrition - Carbohydrates and fats.\\" Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University. Web site accessed February 9, 2007.Karen Spivey and Jackie Nix. \\"Haylage\\" North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service. Web site accessed July 4, 2009. The digestive system Horses and other members of the genus Equus are adapted by evolutionary biology to eating small amounts of the same kind of food all day long. In the wild, horses ate prairie grasses in semi-arid regions and traveled significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition.Budiansky, Stephen. The Nature of Horses. Free Press, 1997. Therefore, their digestive system was made to work best with a small but steady flow of food that does not change much from day to day. =Chewing and swallowing= Digestion begins in the mouth. First, the animal selects pieces of forage and picks up finer foods, such as grain, with sensitive, prehensile, lips. The front teeth of the horse, called incisors, nip off forage, and food is ground up for swallowing by the premolars and molars. The esophagus carries food to the stomach. The esophagus enters the stomach at an acute angle, creating a one-way valve, with a powerful sphincter mechanism at the gastroesophageal junction, which is why horses cannot vomit. The esophagus is also the area of the digestive tract where horses may suffer from choke. (see Illnesses related to improper feeding below) =The stomach and small intestine= Horses have a small stomach for their size, which limits the amount of feed that can be taken in at one time. The average sized horse has a stomach with a capacity of only , and works best when it contains about . One reason continuous foraging or several small feedings per day are better than one or two large meals is because the stomach begins to empty when it is two- thirds full, whether the food in the stomach is processed or not. The small intestine is long and holds to . This is the major digestive organ where 50 to 70 percent of all nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream.\\"Horse Nutrition - The Horse's Digestive System.\\" Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University. Web site accessed February 9, 2007. Bile from the liver acts here, combined with enzymes from the pancreas and small intestine itself. Equids do not have a gall bladder, so bile flows constantly, an adaptation to a slow but steady supply of food, and another reason for providing fodder to horses in several small feedings. =The cecum and large intestine= The cecum is the first section of the large intestine. It is also known as the \\"water gut\\" or \\"hind gut.\\" It is a blind-ended pouch, about long that holds to . The small intestine opens into the cecum, and the cellulose plant fiber in the food is fermented by microbes for approximately seven hours. The fermented material leaves the cecum through another orifice and passes to the large colon.\\"Digestive Aids: Does Your Horse Need Them?.\\" Equine Review Accessed July 4, 2009. The microbes in the cecum produce vitamin K, B-complex vitamins, proteins, and fatty acids. The reason horses must have their diets changed slowly is so the microbes in the cecum are able to modify and adapt to the different chemical structure of new feedstuffs. Too abrupt a change in diet can cause colic, because new materials are not properly digested. The large colon, small colon, and rectum make up the remainder of the large intestine. The large colon is long and holds up to of semi-liquid matter. Its main purpose is to absorb carbohydrates which were broken down from cellulose in the cecum. Due to its many twists and turns, it is a common place for a type of horse colic called an impaction. The small colon is also long, holds about , is the area where the majority of water is absorbed, and where fecal balls are formed. The rectum is about one foot long, and acts as a holding chamber for waste, which is then expelled from the body via the anus. Nutrients Like all animals, equines require five main classes of nutrients to survive: water, energy (primarily in the form of fats and carbohydrates), proteins, vitamins, and minerals.Russell, Mark A. and Penny M. Bauer. \\"Nutritional Management for Horses\\" Publication AS-429, Purdue University Cooperative Extension. Web site accessed March 13, 2007 =Water= Horses require substantial amounts of clean water every day. Water makes up between 62-68% of a horse's body weight and is essential for life.Kane, Ed. \\"What's new about water.\\" Equus issue 359, August 2007, pp 61-64. Horses can only live a few days without water, becoming dangerously dehydrated if they lose 8-10% of their natural body water. Therefore, it is critically important for horses to have access to a fresh, clean, and adequate supply of water. An average horse drinks of water per day, more in hot weather, when eating dry forage such as hay, or when consuming high levels of salt, potassium, and magnesium. Horses drink less water in cool weather or when on lush pasture, which has a higher water content. When under hard work, or if a mare is lactating, water requirements may be as much as four times greater than normal.\\"Horse Nutrition - Diet Factors - Water.\\" Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University. Web site accessed February 9, 2007. In the winter, snow is not a sufficient source of water for horses. Though they need a great deal of water, horses spend very little time drinking; usually 1–8 minutes a day, spread out in 2-8 episodes. Water plays an important part in digestion. The forages and grains horses eat are mixed with saliva in the mouth to make a moist bolus that can be easily swallowed. Therefore, horses produce up to or 85 lb. of saliva per day. =Energy nutrients and protein= Nutritional sources of energy are fat and carbohydrates. Protein is a critical building block for muscles and other tissues.\\"Horse Nutrition - Protein.\\" Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University. Web site accessed February 9, 2007. Horses that are heavily exercised, growing, pregnant or lactating need increased energy and protein in their diet. However, if a horse has too much energy in its diet and not enough exercise, it can become too high-spirited and difficult to handle.Warren, Lori K. \\"Horse Feeding Myths and Misconceptions\\" Horse Industry Section, Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development Web site accessed February 16, 2007 Fat exists in low levels in plants and can be added to increase the energy density of the diet. Fat has per kilogram of energy, which is 2.25 times that of any carbohydrate source.Mowrey, Robert A. \\"Horse Feeding Management - High- Fat Diets for Horses\\". from North Carolina Cooperative Extension Center , web site accessed February 14, 2007 Because equids have no gall bladder to store large quantities of bile, which flows continuously from the liver directly into the small intestine, fat, though a necessary nutrient, is difficult for them to digest and utilize in large quantities.\\"Digestive System 2\\" , web site accessed August 15, 2011 However, they are able to digest a greater amount of fat than can cattle. Horses benefit from up to 8% fat in their diets, but more does not always provide a visible benefit. Horses can only have 15-20% fat in their diet without the risk of developing diarrhea. Carbohydrates, the main energy source in most rations, are usually fed in the form of hay, grass, and grain. Soluble carbohydrates such as starches and sugars are readily broken down to glucose in the small intestine and absorbed. Insoluble carbohydrates, such as fiber (cellulose), are not digested by the horse's own enzymes, but are fermented by microbes in the cecum and large colon to break down and release their energy sources, volatile fatty acids. Soluble carbohydrates are found in nearly every feed source; corn has the highest amount, then barley and oats. Forages normally have only 6-8% soluble carbohydrate, but under certain conditions can have up to 30%. Sudden ingestion of large amounts of starch or high sugar feeds can cause at the least an indigestion colic, and at the worst potentially fatal colitis or laminitis. Protein is used in all parts of the body, especially muscle, blood, hormones, hooves, and hair cells.\\"Applying Horse Sense to Horse Nutrition\\" Alliance Nutrition Equine. Web site accessed June 6, 2012 The main building blocks of protein are amino acids. Alfalfa and other legumes in hay are good sources of protein that can be easily added to the diet. Most adult horses only require 8-10% protein in their diet; however, higher protein is important for lactating mares and young growing foals. =Vitamins and minerals= Many commercially prepared vitamin and mineral supplements are available for horses. Horses that are not subjected to hard work or extreme conditions usually have more than adequate amounts of vitamins in their diet if they are receiving fresh, green, leafy forages. Sometimes a vitamin/mineral supplement is needed when feeding low- quality hay, if a horse is under stress (illness, traveling, showing, racing, and so on), or not eating well. Grain has a different balance of nutrients than forage, and so requires specialized supplementation to prevent an imbalance of vitamins and minerals. Minerals are required for maintenance and function of the skeleton, nerves, and muscles. These include calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and chloride, and are commonly found in most good-quality feeds. Horses also need trace minerals such as magnesium, selenium, copper, zinc, and iodine. Normally, if adult animals at maintenance levels are consuming fresh hay or are on pasture, they will receive adequate amounts of minerals in their diet, with the exception of sodium chloride (salt), which needs to be provided, preferably free choice. \\"Horse Nutrition - Minerals.\\" Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University. Web site accessed February 14, 2007. Some pastures are deficient in certain trace minerals, including selenium, zinc, and copper,Harper, Frederick. \\"Spring Pasture for your Horses.\\" (PDF) AS-H 147, University of Tennessee Extension Service. Web page accessed July 4, 2009.see also, e.g. Frederick, Howard. \\"Selenium Deficiency\\" AzVDL Newsletter, Vol. 2, number 2, June, 1997.

Calcium and phosphorus are needed in a specific ratio of between 1:1 and 2:1. Adult horses can tolerate up to a 5:1 ratio, foals no more than 3:1. A total ration with a higher ratio of phosphorus than calcium is to be avoided. Over time, imbalance will ultimately lead to a number of possible bone-related problems such as osteoporosis.Huntington, Peter, Jane Myers, and Elizabeth Owens. Horse Sense: The Guide to Horse Care in Australia and New Zealand, 2nd ed. Landlinks Press, 200. p. 126 Foals and young growing horses through their first three to four years have special nutritional needs and require feeds that are balanced with a proper calcium:phosphorus ratio and other trace minerals. A number of skeletal problems may occur in young animals with an unbalanced diet. Hard work increases the need for minerals; sweating depletes sodium, potassium, and chloride from the horse's system. Therefore, supplementation with electrolytes may be required for horses in intense training, especially in hot weather. Types of feed Forages, such as hay, make up the largest portion of the equine diet by weight. Equids can consume approximately 2–2.5% of their body weight in dry feed each day. Therefore, a adult horse could eat up to of food.Hall, Marvin H. and Patricia M. Comerford. \\"Pasture and Hay for Horses - Argonomy facts 32,\\" 1992 University of Pennsylvania, Cooperative Extension Service. Web site accessed February 14, 2007. Foals less than six months of age eat 2-4% of their weight each day.\\"Horse Nutrition - Feeding factors.\\" Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University. Web site accessed February 9, 2007. Solid feeds are placed into three categories: forages (such as hay and grass), concentrates (including grain or pelleted rations), and supplements (such as prepared vitamin or mineral pellets). Equine nutritionists recommend that 50% or more of the animal's diet by weight should be forages. If a horse is working hard and requires more energy, the use of grain is increased and the percentage of forage decreased so that the horse obtains the energy content it needs for the work it is performing. However, forage amount should never go below 1% of the horse's body weight per day. =Forages= Good quality grass hay is green and has visible leaves and young seed heads. Forages, also known as \\"roughage,\\" are plant materials classified as legumes or grasses, found in pastures or in hay. Often, pastures and hayfields will contain a blend of both grasses and legumes. Nutrients available in forage vary greatly with maturity of the grasses, fertilization, management, and environmental conditions. Grasses are tolerant of a wide range of conditions and contain most necessary nutrients. Some commonly used grasses include timothy, brome, fescue, coastal Bermuda, orchard grass, and Kentucky bluegrass. Another type of forage sometimes provided to horses is beet pulp, a byproduct left over from the processing of sugar beets, which is high in energy as well as fiber. Legumes such as clover or alfalfa are usually higher in protein, calcium, and energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good soil to produce the best nutrients. Legume hays are generally higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities. Hay is a dried mixture of grasses and legumes. It is cut in the field and then dried and baled for storage. Hay is most nutritious when it is cut early on, before the seed heads are fully mature and before the stems of the plants become tough and thick. Hay that is very green can be a good indicator of the amount of nutrients in the hay; however, color is not the sole indicator of quality--smell and texture are also important.\\"Horse Nutrition - Hay quality.\\" Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University. Web site accessed February 9, 2007 Hay can be analyzed by many laboratories and that is the most reliable way to tell the nutritional values it contains. Hay, particularly alfalfa, is sometimes compressed into pellets or cubes. Processed hay can be of more consistent quality and is more convenient to ship and to store. It is also easily obtained in areas that may be suffering localized hay shortages. However, these more concentrated forms can be overfed and horses are somewhat more prone to choke on them. On the other hand, hay pellets and cubes can be soaked until they break apart into a pulp or thick slurry, and in this state are a very useful source of food for horses with tooth problems such as dental disease, tooth loss due to age, or structural anomalies. Haylage, also known as Round bale silage is a term for grass sealed in airtight plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States.Pony Care:Feeding the pony/horse. Web site, accessed March 13, 2007 Because haylage is a type of silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale. Sometimes, straw or chaff is fed to animals. However, this is roughage with little nutritional value other than providing fiber.Mackay, Bruce. \\"Practical feeding of horses\\" PRIMEFACT 425 September, 2007, New South Wales, Department of Primary Industries. Web site accessed July 25, 2008 It is sometimes used as a filler; it can slow down horses who eat their grain too fast, or it can provide additional fiber when the horse must meet most nutritional needs via concentrated feeds.\\"Chaff or no Chaff?\\" Hygain news, web site accessed July 4, 2009. Straw is more often used as a bedding in stalls to absorb wastes. =Concentrates= Oats A premixed ration of crimped corn, oats, barley and pelleted supplement Grains Whole or crushed grains are the most common form of concentrated feed, sometimes referred to generically as \\"oats\\" or \\"corn\\" even if those grains are not present, also sometimes called straights in the UK. Oats are the most popular grain for horses. Oats have a lower digestible energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains. They form a loose mass in the stomach that is well suited to the equine digestive system. They are also more palatable and digestible than other grains. Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is the second most palatable grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, it is easy to over-feed, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses. Barley is also fed to horses, but needs to be processed to crack the seed hull and allow easier digestibility. It is frequently fed in combination with oats and corn, a mix informally referred to by the acronym \\"COB\\" (for Corn, Oats and Barley). Wheat is generally not used as a concentrate. However, wheat bran is sometimes added to the diet of a horse for supplemental nutrition, usually moistened and in the form of a bran mash. Wheat bran is high in phosphorus, so must be fed carefully so that it does not cause an imbalance in the Ca:P ratio of a ration. Once touted for a laxative effect, this use of bran is now considered unnecessary, as horses, unlike humans, obtain sufficient fiber in their diets from other sources. Mixes and pellets Many feed manufacturers combine various grains and add additional vitamin and mineral supplements to create a complete premixed feed that is easy for owners to feed and of predictable nutritional quality. Some of these prepared feeds are manufactured in pelleted form, others retain the grains in their original form. In many cases molasses is used as a binder to keep down dust and for increased palatability. Grain mixes with added molasses are usually called \\"sweet feed\\" in the United States and \\"coarse mix\\" in the United Kingdom. Pelleted or extruded feeds (sometimes referred to as \\"nuts\\" in the UK) may be easier to chew and result in less wasted feed. Horses generally eat pellets as easily as grain. However, pellets are also more expensive, and even \\"complete\\" rations do not eliminate the necessity for forage.Briggs, Karen. \\"Pelleted Feeds: Packaged Nutrition.\\" The Horse, October 1, 1997 Supplements The average modern horse on good hay or pasture with light work usually does not need supplements; however, horses subjected to stress due to age, intensive athletic work, or reproduction may need additional nutrition. Extra fat and protein are sometimes added to the horse's diet, along with vitamin and mineral supplements. There are hundreds, if not thousands of commercially prepared vitamin and mineral supplements on the market, many tailored to horses with specialized needs. Soybean meal is a common protein supplement, and averages about 44% crude protein. The protein in soybean meal is high-quality, with the proper ratio of dietary essential amino acids for equids. Cottonseed meal, linseed meal, and peanut meal are also used, but are not as common. Feeding practices A pelleted or extruded horse ration contains grain and other plant products, plus vitamin and mineral supplements. Most horses only need quality forage, water, and a salt or mineral block. Grain or other concentrates are often not necessary. But, when grain or other concentrates are fed, quantities must be carefully monitored. To do so, horse feed is measured by weight, not volume. For example, of oats has a different volume than of corn. When continuous access to feed is not possible, it is more consistent with natural feeding behavior to provide three small feedings per day instead of one or two large ones. However, even two daily feedings is preferable to only one. To gauge the amount to feed, a weight tape can be used to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of a horse's weight. The tape measures the circumference of the horse's barrel, just behind the withers and elbows, and the tape is calibrated to convert circumference into approximate weight. Actual amounts fed vary by the size of the horse, the age of the horse, the climate, and the work to which the animal is put.Giles SR, Rands SA, Nicol CJ, Harris PA. Obesity prevalence and associated risk factors in outdoor living domestic horses and ponies. PeerJ. 2014;2:e299 In addition, genetic factors play a role. Some animals are naturally easy keepers (good doers), which means that they can thrive on small amounts of food and are prone to obesity and other health problems if overfed. Others are hard keepers (poor doers), meaning that they are prone to be thin and require considerably more food to maintain a healthy weight. Veterinarians are usually a good source for recommendations on appropriate types and amounts of feed for a specific horse. Animal nutritionists are also trained in how to develop equine rations and make recommendations. There are also numerous books written on the topic. Feed manufacturers usually offer very specific guidelines for how to select and properly feed products from their company, and in the United States, the local office of the Cooperative Extension Service can provide educational materials and expert recommendations. =Feeding forages= Equids always require forage. When possible, nutritionists recommend it be available at all times, at least when doing so does not overfeed the animal and lead to obesity. It is safe to feed a ration that is 100% forage (along with water and supplemental salt), and any feed ration should be at least 50% forage. Hay with alfalfa or other legumes has more concentrated nutrition and so is fed in smaller amounts than grass hay, though many hays have a mixture of both types of plant. When beet pulp is fed, a ration of to is usually soaked in water for 3 to 4 hours prior to feeding in order to make it more palatable, and to minimize the risk of choke and other problems. It is usually soaked in a proportion of one part beet pulp to two parts water. Beet pulp is usually fed in addition to hay, but occasionally is a replacement for hay when fed to very old horses who can no longer chew properly. It is available in both pelleted and shredded form, pellets must be soaked significantly longer than shredded beet pulp. Some pelleted rations are designed to be a \\"complete\\" feed that contains both hay and grain, meeting all the horse's nutritional needs. However, even these rations should have some hay or pasture provided, a minimum of a half-pound of forage for every of horse, in order to keep the digestive system functioning properly and to meet the horse's urge to graze. When horses graze under natural conditions, they may spend up to 18 hours per day doing so.Blikslager, Anthony. \\"Avoiding Colic Through Management.\\" The Horse July 2008: 47-54. However, on modern irrigated pastures, they may have their nutritional needs for forage met in as little as three hours per day, depending on the quality of grass available. Recent studies address the level of various non-structural carbohydrates (NSC), such as fructan, in forages. Too high an NSC level causes difficulties for animals prone to laminitis or equine polysaccharide storage myopathy (EPSM). NSC cannot be determined by looking at forage, but hay and pasture grasses can be tested for NSC levels.Watts, Kathryn. \\"Finding and Testing Low-Sugar Forage,\\" The Horse Web site, accessed May 16, 2007. =Feeding concentrates= Concentrates, when fed, are recommended to be provided in quantities no greater than 1% of a horse's body weight per day, and preferably in two or more feedings. If a ration needs to contain a higher percent of concentrates, such as that of a race horse, bulky grains such as oats should be used as much as possible; a loose mass of feed helps prevent impaction colic.Depew, Clint. \\"Proper Nutrition,\\" LSUAgCenter. Web site accessed March 13, 2007 Peptic ulcers are linked to a too-high concentration of grain in the diet, particularly noticed in modern racehorses, where some studies show such ulcers affecting up to 90% of all race horses.Gastric Ulcers in the Adult Horse In general, the portion of the ration that should be grain or other concentrated feed is 0-10% grain for mature idle horses; between 20-70% for horses at work, depending on age, intensity of activity, and energy requirements. Concentrates should not be fed to horses within one hour before or after a heavy workout. Concentrates also need to be adjusted to level of performance. Not only can excess grain and inadequate exercise lead to behavior problems, it may also trigger serious health problems that include Equine Exertional Rhabdomyolysis, or \\"tying up,\\" in horses prone to the condition. Another possible risk are various forms of horse colic. A relatively uncommon, but usually fatal concern is colitis-X, which may be triggered by excess protein and lack of forage in the diet that allows for the multiplication of clostridial organisms, and is exacerbated by stress. =Access to water= Horses normally require free access to all the fresh, clean water they want, and to avoid dehydration, should not be kept from water longer than four hours at any one time.\\"Waiting for Water,\\" from column, \\"Ask Horse Journal.\\" Horse Journal, August, 2007, p. 23 However, water may need to be temporarily limited in quantity when a horse is very hot after a heavy workout. As long as a hot horse continues to work, it can drink its fill at periodic intervals, provided that common sense is used and that an overheated horse is not forced to drink from extremely cold water sources. But when the workout is over, a horse needs to be cooled out and walked for 30–90 minutes before it can be allowed all the water it wants at one time. However, dehydration is also a concern, so some water needs to be offered during the cooling off process. A hot horse will properly rehydrate while cooling off if offered a few swallows of water every three to five minutes while being walked. Sometimes the thirst mechanism does not immediately kick in following a heavy workout, which is another reason to offer periodic refills of water throughout the cooling down period. Even a slightly dehydrated horse is at higher risk of developing impaction colic. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed. Thus, it is especially important for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add electrolytes to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature. =Special feeding issues for ponies= Ponies need less feed than full-sized horses. Ponies and miniature horses are usually easy keepers and need less feed than full-sized horses. This is not only because they are smaller, but also, because they evolved under harsher living conditions than horses, they use feed more efficiently.\\"Don't Over Feed Your Pony: Ponies Need Smaller Portions than Horses for Proper Nutrition,\\" Horses and Horse Information. Web site, accessed March 13, 2007 Ponies easily become obese from overfeeding and are at high risk for colic and, especially, laminitis.King, Marcia. \\"Mini Management 101\\" The Horse, online edition. March 1, 2007, accessed July 22, 2010. Fresh grass is a particular danger to ponies; they can develop laminitis in as little as one hour of grazing on lush pasture.Blocksdorf, Katherine. \\"Feeding Your Pony\\" Web site accessed March 13, 2007. Incorrect feeding is also as much a concern as simple overfeeding. Ponies and miniatures need a diet relatively low in sugars and starches and calories, but higher in fibers. Miniature horses in particular need fewer calories pound for pound than a regular horse, and are more prone to hyperlipemia than regular horses, and are also at higher risk of developing equine metabolic syndrome. It is important to track the weight of a pony carefully, by use of a weight tape. Forages may be fed based on weight, at a rate of about of forage for every . Forage, along with water and a salt and mineral block, is all most ponies require. If a hard-working pony needs concentrates, a ratio of no more than 30% concentrates to 70% forage is recommended. Concentrates designed for horses, with added vitamins and minerals, will often provide insufficient nutrients at the small serving sizes needed for ponies. Therefore, if a pony requires concentrates, feed and supplements designed specially for ponies should be used. In the UK, extruded pellets designed for ponies are sometimes called \\"pony nuts\\". =Special feeding issues for mules and donkeys= Donkeys and mules need less concentrated feed than horses. Like ponies, mules and donkeys are also very hardy and generally need less concentrated feed than horses. Mules need less protein than horses and do best on grass hay with a vitamin and mineral supplement.Fuess, Theresa, PhD. \\"What Is a Mule Made Of?\\", University of Illinois, College of Veterinary Medicine. Web site accessed August 15, 2011. If mules are fed concentrates, they only need about half of what a horse requires.\\"Horses, donkeys and mules:Feed and water for equines.\\" FAO Corporate Document Repository. Web site, accessed March 13, 2007 Like horses, mules require fresh, clean water, but are less likely to over-drink when hot. Donkeys, like mules, need less protein and more fiber than horses. Although the donkey's gastrointestinal tract has no marked differences in structure to that of the horse, donkeys are more efficient at digesting food and thrive on less forage than a similar sized pony.Smith, David and Stephanie Wood. \\"Donkey Nutrition.\\" The Professional Handbook of the Donkey Duncan, James and Hadrill, David (2008) Whittet Books. Volume 4, p. 10. They only need to eat 1.5% of their body weight per day in dry matter.Wood, Stephanie, David Smith and Catherine Morris. \\"Seasonal variation of digestible energy requirements of mature donkeys in the UK\\". Proceedings Equine Nutrition Conference. Hanover, Germany. 1–2 October 2005:p. 39-40. It is not fully understood why donkeys are such efficient digestors, but it is thought that they may have a different microbial population in the large intestine than do horses, or possibly an increased gut retention time.Smith DG, Pearson RA. \\"A review of the factors affecting the survival of donkeys in semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa.\\" (Special issue: Nutrition and health of donkeys in the tropics) Tropical Animal Health and Production. 2005. 37: Supplement 1, 1-19. Donkeys do best when allowed to consume small amounts of food over long periods, as is natural for them in an arid climate. They can meet their nutritional needs on 6 to 7 hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought. If they are worked long hours or do not have access to pasture, they require hay or a similar dried forage, with no more than a 1:4 ratio of legumes to grass. They also require salt and mineral supplements, and access to clean, fresh water.Aganga, A.A., et al. \\"Feeding donkeys\\" Livestock Research for Rural Development 12 (2) 2000. Department of Animal Science and Production, Botswana College of Agriculture. Web site accessed July 4, 2009. Like ponies and mules, in a lush climate, donkeys are prone to obesity and are at risk of laminitis.\\"Feeding Your Donkey\\" Web site accessed July 4, 2009. =Treats= Many people like to feed horses special treats such as carrots, sugar cubes, peppermint candies, or specially manufactured horse \\"cookies.\\" Horses do not need treats, and due to the risk of colic or choke, many horse owners do not allow their horses to be given treats. There are also behavioral issues that some horses may develop if given too many treats, particularly a tendency to bite if hand-fed, and for this reason many horse trainers and riding instructors discourage the practice.\\"The Debate Over Treats.\\" Equus no. 345, June 2006, p. 42 However, if treats are allowed, carrots and compressed hay pellets are common, nutritious, and generally not harmful. Apples are also acceptable, though it is best if they are first cut into slices. Horse \\"cookies\\" are often specially manufactured out of ordinary grains and some added molasses. They generally will not cause nutritional problems when fed in small quantities. However, many types of human foods are potentially dangerous to a horse and should not be fed. This includes bread products, meat products, candy, and carbonated or alcoholic beverages. It was once a common practice to give horses a weekly bran mash of wheat bran mixed with warm water and other ingredients. It is still done regularly in some places. While a warm, soft meal is a treat many horses enjoy, and was once considered helpful for its laxative effect, it is not nutritionally necessary. An old horse with poor teeth may benefit from food softened in water, a mash may help provide extra hydration, and a warm meal may be comforting in cold weather, but horses have far more fiber in their regular diet than do humans, and so any assistance from bran is unnecessary. There is also a risk that too much wheat bran may provide excessive phosphorus, unbalancing the diet, and a feed of unusual contents fed only once a week could trigger a bout of colic. Feed storage Hay stored in a shed to keep it dry All hay and concentrated feeds must be kept dry and free of mold, rodent feces, and other types of contamination that may cause illness in horses. Feed kept outside or otherwise exposed to moisture can develop mold quite quickly. Due to fire hazards, hay is often stored under an open shed or under a tarp, rather than inside a horse barn itself, but should be kept under some kind of cover. Concentrates take up less storage space, are less of a fire hazard, and are usually kept in a barn or enclosed shed. A secure door or latched gate between the animals and any feed storage area is critical. Horses accidentally getting into stored feed and eating too much at one time is a common but preventable way that horses develop colic or laminitis. (see Illnesses related to improper feeding below) It is generally not safe to give a horse feed that was contaminated by the remains of a dead animal. This is a potential source of botulism.Heusner, Gary. \\"Horse Feed Quality and Contamination\\" (PDF) Web site accessed July 4, 2009. This is not an uncommon situation. For example, mice and birds can get into poorly stored grain and be trapped; hay bales sometimes accidentally contain snakes, mice, or other small animals that were caught in the baling machinery during the harvesting process. Feeding behavior Horses can become anxious or stressed if there are long periods of time between meals. They also do best when they are fed on a regular schedule; they are creatures of habit and easily upset by changes in routine. When horses are in a herd, their behavior is hierarchical;Williams, Carey A.Ph.D., Extension Specialist. \\"The Basics of Equine Behavior,\\" FS #525 from Equine Science Center, Rutgers University, 2004. Web site accessed February 14, 2007 the higher-ranked animals in the herd eat and drink first. Low-status animals, who eat last, may not get enough food, and if there is little available feed, higher-ranking horses may keep lower-ranking ones from eating at all. Therefore, unless a herd is on pasture that meets the nutritional needs of all individuals, it is important to either feed horses separately, or spread feed out in separate areas to be sure all animals get roughly equal amounts of food to eat. In some situations where horses are kept together, they may still be placed into separate herds, depending on nutritional needs; overweight horses are kept separate from thin horses so that rations may be adjusted accordingly. Horses may also eat in undesirable ways, such as bolting their feed, or eating too fast. This can lead to either choke or colic under some circumstances. Dental issues Horses' teeth continually erupt throughout their life, are worn down as they eat, and can develop uneven wear patterns that can interfere with chewing. For this reason, horses need a dental examination at least once a year, and particular care must be paid to the dental needs of older horses. Reynolds, Judith A, Ph.D., P.A.S. \\"The 'Old Horse' Dilemma,\\" ADM Alliance Nutrition. Web site accessed June 6, 2012 The process of grinding off uneven wear patterns on a horse's teeth is called floating and can be performed by a veterinarian or a specialist in equine dentistry. Illnesses related to improper feeding Colic, choke, and laminitis can be life-threatening when a horse is severely affected, and veterinary care is necessary to properly treat these conditions.Brady. C.M., K.S. Kanne, and M.A. Russell. \\"Introduction to Horse Health,\\" AS-555-W, Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service, 10/02 Web site accessed February 16, 2007. Other conditions, while not life- threatening, may have serious implications for the long-term health and soundness of a horse. =Colic= Horse colic itself is not a disease, but rather a description of symptoms connected to abdominal pain. It can occur due to any number of digestive upsets, from mild bloating due to excess intestinal gas to life-threatening impactions.Douglas, Janet. \\"The Colic Fact Sheet.\\" Web site, accessed March 13, 2007 Colic is most often caused by a change in diet, either a planned change that takes place too quickly, or an accidental change, such as a horse getting out of its barn or paddock and ingesting unfamiliar plants. But colic has many other possible triggers including insufficient water, an irregular feeding schedule, stress, and illness.\\"Colic in Horses\\" Cooperative Extension Service, University of Kentucky, College of Agriculture. Web site accessed March 13, 2007 Because the horse cannot vomit and has a limited capacity to detoxify harmful substances, anything upsetting to the horse must travel all the way through the digestive system to be expelled. =Choke= Choke is not as common as colic, but is nonetheless commonly considered a veterinary emergency. The most common cause of choke is horses not chewing their food thoroughly, usually because of eating their food too quickly, especially if they do not have sufficient access to water, but also sometimes due to dental problems that make chewing painful. It is exceedingly difficult for a horse to expel anything from the esophagus, and immediate treatment is often required. Unlike choking in humans, choke in horses does not cut off respiration. =Laminitis= Horses are also susceptible to laminitis, a disease of the lamina of the hoof. Laminitis has many causes, but the most common is related to a sugar and starch overload from a horse overeating certain types of food, particularly too much pasture grass high in fructan in early spring and late fall, or by consuming excessive quantities of grain.Safergrass.org web site, accessed February 26, 2007 =Growth disorders= Young horses that are overfed or are fed a diet with an improper calcium:phosphorus ratio over time may develop a number of growth and orthopedic disorders, including osteochondrosis (OCD), angular limb deformities (ALD),Loving, Nancy. \\"Limb Deformities: Congenital or Acquired?\\" The Horse, Online edition, July 1, 2003.

He played college football at Stanford University. Early years Laidlaw attended Hawthorne High School. He accepted a football scholarship from for Stanford University. As a sophomore backup, he averaged 5.6 yards per carry, rushing 48 times for 268 yards. As a junior, he was named the starter at fullback, leading the team in rushing with 639 yards and 4 touchdowns, while making 19 catches for 155 yards and one receiving touchdown. The next year he led the team again in rushing with 636 yards and 4 touchdowns, also posting 14 catches for 135 yards and one receiving touchdown. He finished fourth in the school career rushing list, with 1,543 rushing yards (4.4-yard average), while playing on pass-oriented offenses. He also had 40 receptions for 351 yards. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Laidlaw was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourteenth round (356th overall) of the 1975 NFL Draft, also known as the Dirty Dozen draft. As a rookie, he was used mainly in short yardage situations, until suffering a mid season knee injury that placed him on the injured reserve list. His running style reminded the media and observers of Walt Garrison. In 1976, he replaced an injured Robert Newhouse in the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles, rushing for 104 yards on 19 carries, along with 7 receptions for 66 yards. He missed 3 games with severe rib bruises he suffered against the Baltimore Colts and his return was also hindered by a bout with the flu. Against the Atlanta Falcons he rushed for 88 yards on 15 carries. He finished with 424 rushing yards (third on the team), 325 receiving yards (third on the team) and 84 scored points (fourth on the team). In 1977, he suffered a hamstring pull in training camp which limited his preseason action and kept him from seriously competing for the starting fullback job with Newhouse. As a backup that was used mainly on passing situations, he made just 5 receptions for 15 yards and 9 carries for 60 yards. He was a part of the Super Bowl XII winning team. In 1978, an injury to Newhouse late in the season allowed him to become an important contributor in the final push toward a second straight Super Bowl appearance. Against the Washington Redskins on Thanksgiving he had 16 carries for 122 yards and 2 touchdowns, including 103 first-half rushing yards and a 59-yard run to set up a field goal. Two weeks later against the Philadelphia Eagles, he scored on a 44-yard screen pass reception and on a one-yard run. In the first-round playoff game against the Atlanta Falcons, he had 17 carries for 66 yards and 2 touchdowns. The following week in the conference championship game against the Los Angeles Rams, he had a four-yard scoring reception that put the Cowboys ahead 14-0 in the fourth quarter. Laidlaw ended up scoring 7 touchdowns in the 6 games prior to Super Bowl XIII. In 1979, he was set to contend with Newhouse for the starting fullback job, but Laidlaw suffered a pulled hamstring in training camp and was unable to make a serious challenge. After Newhouse was limited with a leg injury he sustained in the season opener, him and Laidlaw were used as interchangeable play messengers during the first half of the season. Laidlaw could never regain his full strength however, because of a cyst he had behind his left knee that was removed until the offseason. On August 26, 1980, he was released after the team gave his roster spot to rookie Timmy Newsome. During his time with the Cowboys, although his effectiveness was limited by a series of injuries, he still managed to be a key backup and a part of three Super Bowl teams. =New York Giants= On September 11, 1980, he was signed as a free agent by the New York Giants, where he played mainly on special teams, before he asked for and was given his release on October 31.

The canyon was formed by retreating glaciers which reached their last glacial maximum around 15,000 years ago. While Garnet Canyon is a less popular destination for recreational hikers than nearby Cascade Canyon or Death Canyon, it is an important approach to many significant and popular mountaineering climbs including routes found on Grand Teton, Middle Teton, South Teton and Disappointment Peak. The trailhead for Garnet Canyon is found at Lupine Meadows, and the canyon itself is reached after several miles of hiking through forest and switchbacks which climb a large lateral moraine. The entrance to the canyon is guarded by a boulderfield that requires some Class 3 scrambling to cross. Beyond the boulderfield is the popular camping area known as the Meadows, above which the canyon divides into north and south forks. The north fork leads up to the lower saddle between Middle Teton and Grand Teton and is the starting point for many classic climbs on Grand Teton. The south fork climbs up to a saddle between Middle Teton and South Teton and is the starting point for some of the easier routes up those two summits. Middle Teton viewed from Garnet Canyon Backcountry camping is allowed, by permit, in Garnet Canyon at areas designated by the National Park Service. Camping permits can be obtained in advance via registration or in person at the Jenny Lake Ranger Station.

History The Hussite Bible is the only written vestige of Hussitism in Hungary. The book - or at least the most of it - was translated by Tamás Pécsi and Bálint Újlaki. Both Pécsi and Újlaki had attended the University of Prague in Bohemia between 1399 and 1411, where they got to know the concepts of Jan Hus, a reformist Christian theologian. Concluded from the calendar found in the Codex of Munich, the two Franciscan priests may already had begun the work in 1416, and they finished it at latest in 1441. Pécsi had had to escape soon from Hungary due to the Inquisition, thus he and many of his followers moved to Moldavia. They had been unsuccessful: the translation was confiscated. The original manuscript is not known, most likely it perished. Most text of the Hussite Bible was revealed from partial copies. The most important extant copies of this translation are the Codex of Munich, the Codex of Wien, and the Apor Codex. Some other, shorter parts had been transcribed to other Hungarian dialects as well; these can be found in other 15th century Hungarian codices. Features =Vocabulary= The translation's language is archaic, with many terms unknown in Modern Hungarian. Also, it contains several rare Old Hungarian words, thus provides an interesting insight to the Hungarian language at the time. These include (with Modern Hungarian equivalent and English translation in parentheses): monnál (mintegy, or so), midenem (nemde, is it right?), csajva (cserebogár, cockchafer), gördőlet (mennydörgés, thunder), etc. In some respects, the Hussite Bible's translators were the first reformers of Hungarian: they coined several new terms, which today sound constrained. Some examples: császárlat (imperium), czímerlet (titulus), ezerlő (tribunus), negyedlő (tetrarch), and so on. =Orthography= The Bible's orthography was influenced by early 15th century Czech spelling. Pécsi and Újlaki adopted the system of writing special sounds with diacritic marks. (i. e, writing with ń, or with è, etc.) This orthography later spread among the Hungarian Franciscan friars as well, and had a great influence on spelling in 16th-century Hungarian printed books. However, the modern Hungarian alphabet has different origins. Copies =Codex of Wien= The oldest of the copies is the Codex of Wien. It contains parts of the Old Testament. The codex has 162 pages, each with a size of 216 by 142 millimetres. The book is the work of three hands from the second half of the 15th century. Since the 18th century, the manuscript was kept in Vienna (Wien in German), its earlier place is unknown. In 1932, it was moved to the National Széchenyi Library's Section of Manuscripts, Budapest, where it can be found today as well. =Codex of Munich= The Codex of Munich consists of 124 pages, and contains the four Gospels. Its size is 135 by 200 millimetres. The whole manuscript had been written by György Németi, who finished the work in Târgu Trotuș, in the year 1466 AD. It is unknown where the codex was after its completion. The first page shows a reference to Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter(1506–1557) as an early owner, who was a philologist and book collector. After his death, the manuscript was transferred to the Bavarian State Library, where it is kept still today, in an excellent condition. A complete facsimile was published in 1958, as part of the Ural-Altaische Bibliothek (Ural-Altaic Library). =Apor Codex= The Apor codex got its name after its former owner, the Apor family. It is colligatum. Once it contained 208 pages, but 92 perished, and only 116 remained, the first 21 of which are badly damaged. Because of humid storage circumstances, other pages were harmed as well. Its size is 208 by 140 millimetres.

Civilian life  The son of William and Mary McKay, he was born on 27 December 1892 in Brussels, Ontario, Canada. He later moved to London, Ontario to enroll in a Faculty of Arts program at the University of Western Ontario. Once there, McKay excelled in varsity athletics. In particular, his speed was often cited by a student newspaper – The Western University Gazette – as a reason for the success of Western's 1915 Canadian Junior Championship rugby team.  Involvement in the First World War  McKay in Royal Flying Corps uniform, December 1917 Around March 1916, McKay completed his training at the Wright Aviation School in Augusta, Georgia, and shipped off to Europe as a member of the Royal Flying Corps. An editorial that appeared in The Western University Gazette in the same month, described Eddie was as a \\"careful\\" flyer who was one of the best pilots ever produced at Wright. He was assigned to 24 Squadron where he flew an Airco D.H.2 and recorded four victories between 20 July 1916 and 25 January 1917. For his efforts, McKay was promoted to Captain and transferred to train new pilots. Later that year, he cited boredom when he requested to be moved back into a combat role. Subsequently, McKay was reassigned to 23 Squadron flying the French made Spad S. VII. He earned his final six victories (bringing his total to ten) within a one-month period stretching from 19 November 1917 to 18 December 1917. During a 26 October dogfight, McKay was pursued by German ace Manfred von Richthofen when they disrupted Oswald Boelcke and Erwin Bohme's attack on Alfred Gerald Knight. McKay and Knight confirmed that Boelcke collided with Bohme during the assault. On 28 December 1917, McKay was shot down over Belgium. Jasta 2's Leutnant Carl Menckhoff was credited with the victory, although a German 2-seater also claimed a SPAD at this time and place. In Above the Trenches, Christopher Shores suggests that McKay became a prisoner of war after being shot down,Shores, Christopher et al.

In 1920, a local citizen named William Haddon donated the Eddie McKay Cup to the Public School Hockey League in London, Ontario. The cup was meant to be in honor of McKay's \\"athletic manhood and enthusiasm for sport\\".

The organization takes its name from the principle that Americans' homes or businesses should be their castles, that is, places where they are safe and free from abusive government power. The principle has been part of Anglo-American legal tradition since Edward Coke famously stated, \\"...a man's house is his castle\\". The Castle Coalition was founded in March 2002 as a project of the Institute for Justice in response to the number of the requests attorneys received from citizens facing threats of eminent domain who were years away from any actual litigation. After the success of community groups in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and New Rochelle, New York, attorneys at IJ organized a conference for other activists facing eminent domain abuse from around the United States to teach them how to succeed in preventing their local government from taking their property through eminent domain. Castle Coalition-trained activists have been successful in saving their homes in places like Ardmore, Pennsylvania, Chicago, Lakewood, Ohio, and Los Angeles, California. On 13 May 2002, Fortune magazine praised the new organization in a piece titled \\"Fighting City Hall\\": > Superheroes? Maybe.

In 2005, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Kelo v. City of New London. Although the decision allowed for a more expansive view of the public use clause in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution the decision also states, \\"Nothing in our opinion precludes any State from placing further restrictions on its exercise of the takings power.\\" In response to the decision, the Castle Coalition expanded its focus to include the reform of state and local eminent domain laws. In June 2005, they launched a $3 million Hands Off My Home campaign, calling it \\"an aggressive initiative to effect significant and substantial reforms of state and local eminent domain laws.\\" Two years after the beginning of the Hands Off My Home campaign, they published the 50 State Report Card to provide the results of the campaign. By June 2007, 21 states had enacted substantive eminent domain reform and another 21 states had increased eminent domain protections but not nearly enough to prevent takings allowed by the Kelo decision. Eight states had not passed any legislation reforming their eminent domain laws.Castle Coalition - Legislative Center The Castle Coalition provides model legislative language for eminent domain reform, stricter blight statutes and state constitutional amendments. The Castle Coalition also has several publications documenting the extent and nature of eminent domain abuse across the United States. The Castle Coalition also brings activists together for a national conference annually and teaches home and small business owners how to protect themselves and stand up to the over-reaching governments and developers who seek to use eminent domain to take private property for their own gain.

The electrons within a CDW form a standing wave pattern and sometimes collectively carry an electric current. The electrons in such a CDW, like those in a superconductor, can flow through a linear chain compound en masse, in a highly correlated fashion. Unlike a superconductor, however, the electric CDW current often flows in a jerky fashion, much like water dripping from a faucet due to its electrostatic properties. In a CDW, the combined effects of pinning (due to impurities) and electrostatic interactions (due to the net electric charges of any CDW kinks) likely play critical roles in the CDW current's jerky behavior, as discussed in sections 4 & 5 below. Most CDW's in metallic crystals form due to the wave- like nature of electrons – a manifestation of quantum mechanical wave-particle duality – causing the electronic charge density to become spatially modulated, i.e., to form periodic \\"bumps\\" in charge. This standing wave affects each electronic wave function, and is created by combining electron states, or wavefunctions, of opposite momenta. The effect is somewhat analogous to the standing wave in a guitar string, which can be viewed as the combination of two interfering, traveling waves moving in opposite directions (see interference (wave propagation)). The CDW in electronic charge is accompanied by a periodic distortion – essentially a superlattice – of the atomic lattice. The metallic crystals look like thin shiny ribbons (e.g., quasi-1-D NbSe3 crystals) or shiny flat sheets (e.g., quasi-2-D, 1T-TaS2 crystals). The CDW's existence was first predicted in the 1930s by Rudolf Peierls. He argued that a 1-D metal would be unstable to the formation of energy gaps at the Fermi wavevectors ±kF, which reduce the energies of the filled electronic states at ±kF as compared to their original Fermi energy EF. The temperature below which such gaps form is known as the Peierls transition temperature, TP. The electron spins are spatially modulated to form a standing spin wave in a spin density wave (SDW). A SDW can be viewed as two CDWs for the spin-up and spin- down subbands, whose charge modulations are 180° out-of-phase.  Fröhlich model of superconductivity  In 1954, Herbert Fröhlich proposed a microscopic theory, in which energy gaps at ±kF would form below a transition temperature as a result of the interaction between the electrons and phonons of wavevector Q=2kF. Conduction at high temperatures is metallic in a quasi-1-D conductor, whose Fermi surface consists of fairly flat sheets perpendicular to the chain direction at ±kF. The electrons near the Fermi surface couple strongly with the phonons of 'nesting' wave number Q = 2kF. The 2kF mode thus becomes softened as a result of the electron-phonon interaction. The 2kF phonon mode frequency decreases with decreasing temperature, and finally goes to zero at the Peierls transition temperature. Since phonons are bosons, this mode becomes macroscopically occupied at lower temperatures, and is manifested by a static periodic lattice distortion. At the same time, an electronic CDW forms, and the Peierls gap opens up at ±kF. Below the Peierls transition temperature, a complete Peierls gap leads to thermally activated behavior in the conductivity due to normal uncondensed electrons. However, a CDW whose wavelength is incommensurate with the underlying atomic lattice, i.e., where the CDW wavelength is not an integer multiple of the lattice constant, would have no preferred position, or phase φ, in its charge modulation ρ0 \\\\+ ρ1cos[2kFx – φ]. Fröhlich thus proposed that the CDW could move and, moreover, that the Peierls gaps would be displaced in momentum space along with the entire Fermi sea, leading to an electric current proportional to dφ/dt. However, as discussed in subsequent sections, even an incommensurate CDW cannot move freely, but is pinned by impurities. Moreover, interaction with normal carriers leads to dissipative transport, unlike a superconductor.  CDWs in quasi-2-D layered materials  Several quasi-2-D systems, including layered transition metal dichalcogenides, undergo Peierls transitions to form quasi-2-D CDWs. These result from multiple nesting wavevectors coupling different flat regions of the Fermi surface. The charge modulation can either form a honeycomb lattice with hexagonal symmetry or a checkerboard pattern. A concomitant periodic lattice displacement accompanies the CDW and has been directly observed in 1T-TaS2 using cryogenic electron microscopy. In 2012, evidence for competing, incipient CDW phases were reported for layered cuprate high-temperature superconductors such as YBCO.  CDW transport in linear chain compounds  Early studies of quasi-1-D conductors were motivated by a proposal, in 1964, that certain types of polymer chain compounds could exhibit superconductivity with a high critical temperature Tc. The theory was based on the idea that pairing of electrons in the BCS theory of superconductivity could be mediated by interactions of conducting electrons in one chain with nonconducting electrons in some side chains. (By contrast, electron pairing is mediated by phonons, or vibrating ions, in the BCS theory of conventional superconductors.) Since light electrons, instead of heavy ions, would lead to the formation of Cooper pairs, their characteristic frequency and, hence, energy scale and Tc would be enhanced. Organic materials, such as TTF-TCNQ were measured and studied theoretically in the 1970s. These materials were found to undergo a metal-insulator, rather than superconducting, transition. It was eventually established that such experiments represented the first observations of the Peierls transition. The first evidence for CDW transport in inorganic linear chain compounds, such as transition metal trichalcogenides, was reported in 1976 by Monceau et al., who observed enhanced electrical conduction at increased electric fields in NbSe3. The nonlinear contribution to the electrical conductivity σ vs. field E was fit to a Landau-Zener tunneling characteristic ~ exp[-E0/E] (see Landau–Zener formula), but it was soon realized that the characteristic Zener field E0 was far too small to represent Zener tunneling of normal electrons across the Peierls gap. Subsequent experiments showed a sharp threshold electric field, as well as peaks in the noise spectrum (narrow band noise) whose fundamental frequency scales with the CDW current. These and other experiments (e.g.,) confirm that the CDW collectively carries an electric current in a jerky fashion above the threshold field.  Classical models of CDW depinning  Linear chain compounds exhibiting CDW transport have CDW wavelengths λcdw = π/kF incommensurate with (i.e., not an integer multiple of) the lattice constant. In such materials, pinning is due to impurities that break the translational symmetry of the CDW with respect to φ. The simplest model treats the pinning as a sine-Gordon potential of the form u(φ) = u0[1 – cosφ], while the electric field tilts the periodic pinning potential until the phase can slide over the barrier above the classical depinning field. Known as the overdamped oscillator model, since it also models the damped CDW response to oscillatory (ac) electric fields, this picture accounts for the scaling of the narrow-band noise with CDW current above threshold. However, since impurities are randomly distributed throughout the crystal, a more realistic picture must allow for variations in optimum CDW phase φ with position - essentially a modified sine-Gordon picture with a disordered washboard potential. This is done in the Fukuyama-Lee-Rice (FLR) model, in which the CDW minimizes its total energy by optimizing both the elastic strain energy due to spatial gradients in φ and the pinning energy. Two limits that emerge from FLR include weak pinning, typically from isoelectronic impurities, where the optimum phase is spread over many impurities and the depinning field scales as ni2 (ni being the impurity concentration) and strong pinning, where each impurity is strong enough to pin the CDW phase and the depinning field scales linearly with ni. Variations of this theme include numerical simulations that incorporate random distributions of impurities (random pinning model).  Quantum models of CDW transport  Early quantum models included a soliton pair creation model by Maki and a proposal by John Bardeen that condensed CDW electrons tunnel coherently through a tiny pinning gap, fixed at ±kF unlike the Peierls gap. Maki's theory lacked a sharp threshold field and Bardeen only gave a phenomenological interpretation of the threshold field. However, a 1985 paper by Krive and Rozhavsky pointed out that nucleated solitons and antisolitons of charge ±q generate an internal electric field E* proportional to q/ε. The electrostatic energy (1/2)ε[E ± E*]2 prevents soliton tunneling for applied fields E less than a threshold ET = E*/2 without violating energy conservation. Although this Coulomb blockade threshold can be much smaller than the classical depinning field, it shows the same scaling with impurity concentration since the CDW's polarizability and dielectric response ε vary inversely with pinning strength. Building on this picture, as well as a 2000 article on time-correlated soliton tunneling, a more recent quantum model proposes Josephson-like coupling (see Josephson effect) between complex order parameters associated with nucleated droplets of charged soliton dislocations on many parallel chains. Following Richard Feynman in The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. III, Ch. 21, their time-evolution is described using the Schrödinger equation as an emergent classical equation. The narrow-band noise and related phenomena result from the periodic buildup of electrostatic charging energy and thus do not depend on the detailed shape of the washboard pinning potential. Both a soliton pair-creation threshold and a higher classical depinning field emerge from the model, which views the CDW as a sticky quantum fluid or deformable quantum solid with dislocations, a concept discussed by Philip Warren Anderson.  Aharonov–Bohm quantum interference effects  The first evidence for phenomena related to the Aharonov–Bohm effect in CDWs was reported in a 1997 paper, which described experiments showing oscillations of period h/2e in CDW (not normal electron) conductance versus magnetic flux through columnar defects in NbSe3. Later experiments, including some reported in 2012, show oscillations in CDW current versus magnetic flux, of dominant period h/2e, through TaS3 rings up to 85 μm in circumference above 77 K. This behavior is similar to that of the superconducting quantum interference device (see SQUID), lending credence to the idea that CDW electron transport is fundamentally quantum in nature (see quantum mechanics).

It contains twenty- four previously unreleased songs, most recorded between 1994 and 1997 during the sessions for Smith's albums Elliott Smith and Either/Or. The album was well received by critics and reached number 24 in the US Billboard chart, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week.  Background  In August 2006, an \\"excited\\" employee at Kill Rock Stars made a post on the label's official website stating that an extended version of Either/Or would be released in 2006 to commemorate the record's tenth anniversary. This information was quickly pulled from the website, as the album was in very early planning stages. Eventually, Kill Rock Stars announced that Either/Or: Extended Edition (as it was to be called) had been scrapped in favor of a rarities and unreleased music compilation from Smith's time at the label. Mixing for the album was done by Larry Crane, the archivist for Smith's estate. The album cover was created by Portland, Oregon artist Mike King, who has produced work for numerous other musicians. = Track information = The selections on New Moon are primarily taken from the sessions of Elliott Smith and Either/Or, with some tracks culled from early XO sessions, and a 1996 radio session. For the Either/Or record, Smith recorded a song entitled \\"Pretty Mary K\\", which is featured on this set. However, after scrapping this song, Smith used the title \\"Pretty Mary K\\" for a different song on his Figure 8 album. Later, while recording From a Basement on the Hill, Smith recorded a new version of the former song under the title \\"Everything's OK\\". Thus, \\"Pretty Mary K (Other Version)\\" on the New Moon set is essentially an early version of \\"Everything's OK\\".  Release  New Moon reached number 16 in the US chart. It sold around 24,000 copies in its first week. It was awarded a silver certification from the Independent Music Companies Association which indicated sales of at least 30,000 copies throughout Europe.http://www.impalamusic.org/arc_static/docum/04-press/2008/PR%20-%2020080910.htm  Critical reception  New Moon was very well received by critics.

The push–pull train units with control cars were hauled by specifically equipped DB Class 101 highpower locomotives. Each unit comprised seven specially manufactured railway coaches based on ICE 2 cars, with flexible gangway connections and a luxurious pearwood and leather interior manufactured by Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau. The Metropolitan's silver, black and orange corporate design clearly differentiated it from the Deutsche Bahn parent group. Trains travelled at a maximum speed of , surpassed only by ICE multiple units. From Monday to Friday the pairs ran four times daily in both directions, on Saturday once and on Sunday twice.

On each wagon there was a train attendant ensuring the safety and comfort of passengers aboard. Former Metropolitan car interior Though during the first weeks of service passenger traffic exceeded the expectations, already by the end of 1999 the occupancy rate remained below profitability level. Despite the promotions of special offers, the capacity utilization further fell due to the growing number of competing offers by low-cost airlines. With the timetable change in December 2004, the Metropolitan services were terminated and partly replaced by ICE Sprinter train connections. The trainsets with only a few years of utilisation were revarnished and integrated into the DB rolling stock.

They were founded (as the Arena-Essex Hammers) by promoter Wally Mawdsley and stock car promoter Chick Woodroffe. The team were nicknamed the Hammers after the West Ham Hammers, a speedway team that closed twelve years earlier.Bamford, R & Jarvis J.(2001). Homes of British Speedway. The team's home track, the Arena Essex Raceway, closed shortly before the end of the 2018 season and the team did not compete in a league in 2019. History From foundation in 1984 until January 2007, the club was known as the Arena-Essex Hammers but new promoter Stuart Douglas renamed them the 'Lakeside' Hammers at the Arena-Essex Raceway. The Arena Essex Raceway was built in 1978 to stage banger racing. The speedway track was unusual because it did not have a safety fence as the stock car circuit acted as a run-off area. It was not until 1991 that a safety fence was installed, but the lack of fence encouraged the riders to ride wider lines than they would otherwise have done. The Hammers competed in the National League (the second league tier) from 1984 until 1990. In 1991 Arena Essex won the British League Division Two Championship and were promoted to the British League. They remained in the top flight until the end of the 1995 season, when a promotion change meant the Hammers had to drop to the Conference League for 1996. From 1997 to 2003, Arena Essex competed in the Premier League, before moving up into the Elite League, the top league of British speedway. The team manager is Jon Cook (previously of the Eastbourne Eagles). The Promoter Stuart Douglas, known affectionately to Hammers fans as 'Stan', took control of the club in 2006. In 2008, the club had one of its most successful years. The Hammers finished joint top of the Elite League table, but due to race points, were in second place. The Hammers lost three of their top four riders with serious injuries towards the end of the season, but still reached the Craven Shield and Elite League play-off finals. In 2009, the club won their first piece of silverware since 1991. They defeated the Coventry Bees 108–77 on aggregate in the KO Cup Final. In 2018 the team opted to move up in to the SGB Championship after competing in the National League for 2017. In September 2018, speedway racing ceased at the track, and the Hammers moved to the Rye House Hoddesden raceway to complete their fixtures.

Viktor Chebrikov: KGB chief who favoured modest Soviet reforms. The Guardian Life and career Born in the industrial city of Dnepropetrovsk in eastern Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union on 27 April 1923, he finished military school in 1942 and served in World War II as a battalion commander.New York Times, 5 July 1999 From July 1942, he commanded a platoon of a cadet rifle regiment in the 64th Army on the Stalingrad Front, but on August 14, 1942, he was seriously wounded. After his recovery, he was deputy platoon commander and commander of a mortar platoon in the 262nd Infantry Regiment of the 184th Infantry Division on the Southwestern and Stalingrad fronts. From 1943 until the end of the war he fought in the ranks of the 575th Infantry Regiment of the 161st Infantry Division on Stepnoye, from August 1943 - on Voronezh, from October 1943 - on the 1st Ukrainian, from August 1944 - on the 4th Ukrainian fronts. His contemporaries describe him as having fought bravely and selflessly. At the front, he was wounded three times (one severe wound and two medium ones), shell-shocked and frostbitten, but each time he returned to duty. After the war Chebrikov wanted to continue his military career, but was refused by the prestigious Frunze Military Academy because of his bad eyesight;The Guardian, 7 July 1999 abandoning his military ambitions, he earned an engineering degree, joined the Communist Party in 1950, and embarked on a political-administrative career, rising through the Ukrainian party ranks until he became First Secretary of the Dnipropetrovsk Party Committee in 1961. In 1967, he was brought to Moscow as personnel manager for the Central Committee. He was Deputy chairman of the KGB under Yuri Andropov from 1968-1982. They began an anti-corruption drive that continued until Andropov's death. Following a brief period under Konstantin Chernenko, Chebrikov was appointed head of internal security under Mikhail Gorbachev. Through information supplied by American spy Aldrich Ames, Chebrikov was able to dismantle the network of CIA operatives in his country. Chebrikov was highly respected for his skills among his American counterparts; according to Kenneth E. deGraffenreid, the senior White House intelligence official in the Ronald Reagan administration: \\"One has to say that Chebrikov's term as KGB chief was the heyday of the KGB in terms of foreign intelligence. In terms of intelligence production -spies, and dishing the Americans on the secrets- they were going strong right up to the end. We uncovered 80 spies during those years. These guys were on the make, and there was no question about their influence.\\" Work in the Committee for State Security As Chairman of the KGB of the USSR, Chebrikov became known primarily as the initiator of the investigation of the \\"Uzbek case\\" about high levels of corruption in Uzbekistan, which resulted in the sudden death of the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan and candidate for membership in the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU Sh.R. Rashidov , arrests of dozens of high-ranking leaders of Uzbekistan. Some other high-ranking corrupt officials were exposed and convicted (up to capital punishment).

The short ballet (4 minutes) follows the last moments in the life of a swan, and was first presented in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905. The ballet has since influenced modern interpretations of Odette in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake and has inspired non-traditional interpretations as well as various adaptations. Background Inspired by swans that she had seen in public parks and by Lord Tennyson's poem \\"The Dying Swan\\", Anna Pavlova, who had just become a ballerina at the Mariinsky Theatre, asked Michel Fokine to create a solo dance for her for a 1905 gala concert being given by artists from the chorus of the Imperial Mariinsky Opera. Fokine suggested Saint-Saëns's cello solo, Le Cygne, which Fokine had been playing at home on a mandolin to a friend's piano accompaniment, and Pavlova agreed. A rehearsal was arranged and the short dance was completed quickly. Fokine remarked in Dance Magazine (August 1931): In 1934, Fokine told dance critic Arnold Haskell: Plot summary The ballet was first titled The Swan but then acquired its current title, following Pavlova's interpretation of the work's dramatic arc as the end of life. The dance is composed principally of upper body and arm movements and tiny steps called pas de bourrée suivi. French critic André Levinson wrote: Performances and critical commentary The Dying Swan was first performed by Pavlova at a gala at the Noblemen's Hall in Saint Petersburg, Russia on Friday, December 22, 1905. It was first performed in the United States at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City on March 18, 1910. American dance critic and photographer Carl Van Vechten noted that the ballet was \\"the most exquisite specimen of [Pavlova's] art which she has yet given to the public.\\" Pavlova performed the piece approximately 4,000 times, and on her deathbed in The Hague, reportedly cried, \\"Prepare my swan costume.\\" Fokine's granddaughter, Isabelle, notes that the ballet does not make \\"enormous technical demands\\" on the dancer but it does make \\"enormous artistic ones because every movement and every gesture should signify a different experience,\\" which is \\"emerging from someone who is attempting to escape death.\\" She notes that modern performances are significantly different from her grandfather's original conception and that the dance today is often made to appear to be a variation of Swan Lake, which she describes as \\"Odette at death's door.\\" Isabelle says that the ballet is not about a ballerina being able to transform herself into a swan, but about death, with the swan as a metaphor. Legacy The Dying Swan by Anna Pavlova (7 sec), ~1907; Yvette Chauvire (10 sec), ~1937; Natalia Makarova (14 sec) Pavlova was recorded dancing The Dying Swan in a 1925 silent film, to which sound is often added. The short ballet has influenced interpretations of Odette in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, particularly during the parting of the lovers in the first lakeside scene. The dance was almost immediately adapted by various ballerinas internationally. As a result, Fokine published an official version of the choreography in 1925, highlighted with 36 photographs of his wife Vera Fokina demonstrating the ballet's sequential poses. At a later date, Kirov-trained Natalia Makarova commented: The ballet has been variously interpreted and adapted. The 1917 Russian film The Dying Swan by director Yevgeni Bauer is the story of an artist who strangles a ballerina. Maya Plisetskaya interpreted the swan as elderly and stubbornly resisting the effects of aging, much like herself. Eventually, the piece came to be considered one of Pavlova's trademarks. More recently, Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo has performed a parody version that emphasizes every excess dormant in the choreography. In 2000, street theatre artist Judith Lanigan created a hula hoop adaptation that has been performed at international street theatre festivals, comedy and burlesque events, and in traditional and contemporary circuses. Several figure skaters have performed The Dying Swan with skate-choreography inspired by the ballet. 1936 Olympic bronze medallist Maribel Vinson reviewed Sonja Henie's 1936 professional debut for The New York Times, noting: Some ballerinas, including Ashley Bouder of New York City Ballet and Nina Ananiashvili, formerly of American Ballet Theatre, have used Dying Swan arms in Swan Lake when making Odette's exit at the end of Act II (the first lakeside scene). Ogden Nash, in his \\"Verses for Camille Saint-Saëns' 'Carnival of the Animals'\\", mentions Pavlova: The swan can swim while sitting down, For pure conceit he takes the crown, He looks in the mirror over and over, And claims to have never heard of Pavlova. In response to impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts, Carlos Acosta, artistic director of the Birmingham Royal Ballet, adapted Fokine's choreography with the ballerina raising her head at the end instead, and with Céline Gittens, principal dancer of the company, and the musicians performing in their respective homes. Misty Copeland, principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre, invited 31 other dancers to dance The Swan to raise fund for the relief fund of the participating dancers' companies and other related funds.

It is one of three high schools in the Stratford area, and one of only two high schools in the Huron-Perth Catholic District School Board (the other being St. Anne's Catholic Secondary School in Clinton, Ontario). Approximately 900 students attend St. Michael. Athletics St. Mikes is well known for its athletic programs. The school continually sends teams to OFSAA, many of which have been very successful. In the 2007-08 year the Senior Girls' Volleyball team captured the Ofsaa gold for the second year in a row while the Senior Boys' team won the bronze medal. Not to be outdone the Senior Boys' Nordic ski team, consisting of Scott Weersink, Brett Weersink, Ian Hartman, and Ian Weir, won an Ofsaa Gold as a team in the 10 km ski race, and a bronze in the relay event. On the girls' side, with an impressive performance Janel Sauder took OFSAA gold individually for winning the Senior Girls' race. Every year, the students who attend St. Mikes participate in an event called \\"March for Mikes\\" where each student is asked to raise $35. This money is distributed among all the sports teams and clubs at St. Mikes to decrease the cost for each individual student to join a club. Clubs and Extracurriculars As well as a strong athletics program, St. Michael also has a vibrant and diverse variety of extracurricular activities that contribute greatly to the school's overall atmosphere. With clubs ranging from the arts to social justice, there is an activity for every student. In recent years, thanks to increased funding, the school has been able to grow and support a band program that currently consists of three different bands (a senior, jazz and junior band). The bands regularly place well at MusicFest Regionals and the local Kiwanis festival that occurs at Stratford Central Secondary School. The Senior Band was invited to participate at the MusicFest Nationals in Ottawa during May 2016. They received a silver award for their performance, and a Gold for sight reading. St. Michael can expect to see improved results in the coming years as more funding is increased to elementary school programs, and the program is further developed by the strong hand of Jeff McIntyre and the dedication of the students.

History  The album would be the last studio album he would make before his death in 2000 of colorectal cancer. It was his first studio album for five years following The Bus Driver's Prayer & Other Stories in 1992 and his first studio album with The Blockheads for 17 years since Laughter in 1980 (though they had produced a live album Warts 'n' Audience in 1991) and is considered by many to be the true successor to his 1977 album New Boots and Panties!! - on his BBC documentary Dury dismissed all of the albums between Do It Yourself and Mr. Love Pants as inferior. The album took around four years to complete and the writing commenced at Acre Farm, Twyford, near Reading, Berkshire, in 1993. Initially Chaz Jankel worked with Ian Dury after returning from living in America for most of the eighties, but arguments between the two and soundman Ian Horne led to Jankel leaving. However, at least two songs, \\"Itinerant Child\\" and \\"Bed O' Roses No. 9\\", were written before he left. Deserted, Dury called Merlin Rhys-Jones who had been in the Music Students (Ian Dury's band for the album 4,000 Weeks' Holiday). They wrote ten songs together before arguments over money caused Rhys-Jones to leave. Two of these would eventually make the album: \\"Jack Shit George\\" and \\"Cacka Boom\\". It is generally considered that Ian Dury's first bout with cancer is what prompted him to reform The Blockheads and work with them solely, which he would do for the rest of his life. Ian Dury's new minder, Derek Hussey a.k.a. Derek the Draw, managed to get Jankel and Dury talking again, if only for a bizarre phonecall from Dury regarding touring America and a fictitious uncle of Jankel's. This led to Jankel having his solicitor write to Dury and Mickey Gallagher saying he would never play with the band again, though he relented after discovering Dury had cancer. The album was recorded at Air Studios, which was also being used by Michael Jackson and was surprisingly trouble free compared to the troublesome recording sessions usually caused by Ian Dury, again his personality changes are attributed to his first bout with cancer - the only major incident being Dury randomly deciding to replace new drummer Steve Monti with Bernard Purdie but after constant opposition from his band Dury relented. \\"Itinerant Child\\" was to be released as Ian Dury & The Blockhead's first single in 17 years (since 1980's \\"Sueperman's Big Sister\\") and a video was recorded but East Central One nixed the idea.

It includes their early operations in North Africa, the Greek Islands, and the Invasion of Italy. They then returned to the United Kingdom and were formed into a brigade with two British, two French and one Belgian regiment. The SAS Brigade then conducted operations in France, Italy again, the Low Countries and finally into Germany. After the war the SAS were disbanded only to be reformed as a Territorial Army regiment, which then led onto the formation of the regular army 22 SAS Regiment. The new regiment has taken part in most of the United Kingdom's small wars since then. However the Ministry of Defence does not comment on special forces matters, therefore little verifiable information exists in the public domain on the regiment's recent activities. At first, service in the SAS was considered an end to an officer's career progression, however in recent years SAS officers have risen to the highest ranks in the British Army. General Peter de la Billière was the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the 1990 Gulf War. General Michael Rose became commander of the United Nations Protection Force in Bosnia in 1994. In 1997 General Charles Guthrie became Chief of the Defence Staff the head of the British Armed Forces. Lieutenant-General Cedric Delves was the Commander of the Field Army and Deputy Commander in Chief NATO Regional Headquarters Allied Forces Northern Europe (RHQ AFNORTH) in 2002–2003. Second World War SAS patrol in North Africa during the Second World War in SAS jeeps. The Special Air Service began life in July 1941, during the Second World War, from an unorthodox idea and plan by Lieutenant David Stirling (of the Scots Guards) who was serving with No. 8 (Guards) Commando. His idea was for small teams of parachute-trained soldiers to operate behind enemy lines to gain intelligence, destroy enemy aircraft, and attack their supply and reinforcement routes. Following a meeting with Major-General Neil Ritchie, the Deputy Chief of Staff, he was granted an appointment with the new Commander- in-Chief Middle East, General Claude Auchinleck. Auchinleck liked the plan and it was endorsed by the Army High Command. At that time, there was already a deception organisation in the Middle East area, which wished to create a phantom airborne brigade to act as a threat to enemy planning. This deception unit was named K Detachment Special Air Service Brigade, and thus Stirling's unit was designated L Detachment Special Air Service Brigade. The force initially consisted of five officers and 60 other ranks.Thompson, p.48 Following extensive training at Kabrit camp, by the River Nile, L Detachment undertook its first operation: Operation Squatter. This parachute drop behind Axis lines, was launched in support of Operation Crusader. During the night of 16/17 November 1941, L Detachment attacked airfields at Gazala and Timimi. Due to Axis resistance and adverse weather conditions, the mission was a disaster with 22 men were killed or captured (one third of the men).Haskew, p.40 Given a second opportunity L Detachment recruited men from Layforce Commando, which was in the process of disbanding. Their second mission was more successful; transported by the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG), they attacked three airfields in Libya destroying 60 aircraft without loss. In October 1941, David Stirling had asked the men to come up with ideas for insignia designs for the new unit. Bob Tait, who had accompanied Stirling on the first raid produced the winning entry: the flaming sword of Excalibur, the legendary weapon of King Arthur. This motif would later be misinterpreted as a winged dagger. In regard to mottoes, \\"Strike and Destroy\\" was rejected as being too blunt. \\"Descend to Ascend\\" seemed inappropriate since parachuting was no longer the primary method of transport. Finally, Stirling settled on \\"Who Dares Wins,\\" which seemed to strike the right balance of valor and confidence. SAS pattern parachute wings, designed by Lieutenant Jock Lewes and depicted the wings of a scarab beetle with a parachute. The wings were to be worn the right shoulder upon completion of parachute training. After three missions, they were worn on the left breast above medal ribbons. The wings, Stirling noted, \\"Were treated as medals in their own right.\\" =1942= Free French Squadron during the link-up between advanced units of the First and Eighth British armies in Tunisia. Their first mission in 1942, was an attack on Bouerat. Transported by the LRDG, they caused severe damage to the harbour, petrol tanks and storage facilities.Shott & McBride, p.9 This was followed up in March by a raid on Benghazi harbour with limited success but they did damage 15 aircraft at Al-Berka. The June 1942 Crete airfield raids at Heraklion, Kasteli, Tympaki and Maleme significant damage was caused but of the attacking force at Heraklion only Major George Jellicoe returned.Shott & McBride, pp. 9–10 In July 1942, Stirling commanded a joint SAS/LRDG patrol that carried out raids at Fuka and Mersa Matruh airfields destroying 30 aircraft.Moliari, p. 75 September was a busy month for the SAS. They were renamed 1st SAS Regiment and consisted of four British squadrons, one Free French Squadron, one Greek Squadron, and the Special Boat Section (SBS).Molinari, p. 25 Operations they took part in were: Operation Agreement and the diversionary raid Operation Bigamy. Bigamy led by Stirling and supported by the LRDG, were to attempt a large-scale raid on Benghazi to destroy the harbour, storage facilities and attack the airfields at Benina and Barce. However, they were discovered after a clash at a roadblock. With the element of surprise lost, Stirling decided not to go ahead with the attack and ordered a withdrawal.Molinari, p.71 Agreement was a joint operation by the SAS and the LRDG who had to seize an inlet at Mersa Sciausc for the main force to land by sea. The SAS successfully evaded enemy defences assisted by German speaking members of the Special Interrogation Group and captured Mersa Sciausc. The main landing failed, being met by heavy machine gun fire forcing the landing force and the SAS/LRDG force to surrender.Molinari, pp.70–71 Operation Anglo a raid on two airfields on the island of Rhodes, from which only two men returned. Destroying three aircraft, a fuel dump and numerous buildings, the surviving SBS men had to hide in the countryside for four days before they could reach the waiting submarine.Haskew, p. 54 =1943= David Stirling who was by that time sometimes referred to as the \\"Phantom Major\\" by the Germans, was captured in January 1943 in the Gabès area by a special anti-SAS unit set up by the Germans.Shott & Mc Bride, p. 11 He spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of war, escaping numerous times before being moved to the supposedly 'escape proof' Colditz Castle. He was replaced as commander 1st SAS by Paddy Mayne.Haskew, p. 42 In April 1943, the 1st SAS was reorganised into the Special Raiding Squadron under the command of Mayne and the Special Boat Squadron under the command of George Jellico.Morgan, p. 15 The Special Boat Squadron operated in the Aegean and the Balkans for the remainder of the war and was disbanded in 1945. Members of 2nd SAS on parade for an inspection by General Bernard Montgomery, following the successful capture of the port of Termoli. On the left is Major E Scratchley DSO, MC, and on the right is Captain Roy Farran holding a German sub-machine-gun The Special Raiding Squadron spearheaded the invasion of Sicily Operation Husky and played more of a commando role raiding the Italian coastline, from which they suffered heavy losses at Termoli. After Sicily they went on to serve in Italy with the newly formed 2nd SAS, a unit which had been formed in Algeria in May 1943 by Stirling's older brother Lieutenant Colonel Bill Stirling. The 2nd SAS had already taken part in operations in support of the Allied landings in Sicily: Operation Narcissus was a raid by 40 members of 2nd SAS on a lighthouse on the south east coast of Sicily. The team landed on 10 July with the mission of capturing the lighthouse and the surrounding high ground. Operation Chestnut involved two teams of ten men each, parachuted into northern Sicily on the night of 12 July, to disrupt communications, transport and the enemy in general. On mainland Italy they were involved in Operation Begonia which was the airborne counterpart to the amphibious Operation Jonquil, from 2 to 6 October, 61 men were parachuted between Ancona and Pescara. The object was to locate escaped prisoners of war in the interior and muster them on beach locations for extraction. Begonia involved the interior parachute drop by 2nd SAS. Jonquil entailed four seaborne beach parties from 2nd SAS with the Free French SAS Squadron as protection. Operation Candytuft was a raid by 2nd SAS on 27 October. Inserted by boat on Italy's east coast between Ancona and Pescara, they were to destroy rail road bridges and disrupt rear areas. Near the end of the year the Special Raiding Squadron reverted to their former title 1st SAS and together with 2nd SAS were withdrawn from Italy and placed under command the 1st Airborne Division.Shott & McBride, p. 12 =1944= In March 1944, the 1st and 2nd SAS Regiments returned to the United Kingdom and joined a newly formed SAS Brigade of the Army Air Corps. The other units in the Brigade were the French 3rd and 4th SAS, the Belgian 5th SAS and F Squadron which was responsible for signals and communications, the brigade commander was Brigadier Roderick McLeod. The brigade was ordered to swap their beige SAS berets for the maroon parachute beret and given shoulder titles for 1, 2, 3 and 4 SAS in the Airborne colours. The French and Belgian regiments also wore the Airborne Pegasus arm badge.Shott & McBride, p.13 The brigade now entered a period of training for their participation in the Normandy Invasion. They were prevented from conducting operations until after the start of the invasion by 21st Army Group. Their task was then to stop German reinforcements reaching the front line,Shott & McBride, p. 14 by being parachuted behind the lines to assist the French Resistance.Shortt & McBride, p. 16 An SAS jeep of 1st SAS near Geilenkirchen, Germany, 18 November 1944. In support of the invasion 144 men of 1st SAS took part in Operation Houndsworth between June and September, in the area of Lyon, Chalon-sur-Saône, Dijon, Le Creusot and Paris. At the same time, 56 Men of 1st SAS also took part in Operation Bulbasket in the Poitiers area. They did have some success before being betrayed. Surrounded by a large German force, they were forced to disperse; later, it was discovered that 36 men were missing and that 32 of them had been captured and executed by the Germans. In mid June, 178 men of the French SAS and 3,000 members of the French resistance took part in Operation Dingson. However, they were forced to disperse after their camp was attacked by the Germans. The French SAS were also involved in Operation Cooney, Operation Samwest and Operation Lost during the same period. In August, 91 men from the 1st SAS were involved in Operation Loyton. The team had the misfortune to land in the Vosges Mountains at a time when the Germans were preparing to defend the Belfort Gap. As a result, the Germans harried the team. The team also suffered from poor weather that prevented aerial resupply. Eventually, they broke into smaller groups to return to their own lines. During the escape 31 men were captured and executed by the Germans. Also in August, men from 2nd SAS operated from forest bases in the Rennes area in conjunction with the resistance. Air resupply was plentiful and the resistance cooperated, which resulted in carnage. The 2nd SAS operated from the Loire through to the forests of Darney to Belfort in just under six weeks. Near the end of the year men from 2nd SAS were parachuted into Italy, to work with the Italian resistance in Operation Tombola, where they remained until Italy was liberated.Shortt & McBride, p. 15 At one point, four groups were active deep behind enemy lines laying waste to airfields, attacking convoys and derailing trains. Towards the end of the campaign, Italian guerrillas and escaped Russian prisoners were enlisted into an 'Allied SAS Battalion' which struck at the German main lines of communications. =1945= Brigadier Mike Calvert, at the ceremony marking the passing of 3 and 4 SAS from the British to the French Army at Tarbes in southern France In March the former Chindit commander, Brigadier Mike Calvert took over command of the brigade. The 3rd and 4th SAS were involved in Operation Amherst in April, The operation began with the drop of 700 men on the night of 7 April. The teams spread out to capture and protect key facilities from the Germans. They encountered Bergen-Belsen on 15 April 1945. Still in Italy in Operation Tombola, Major Roy Farran and 2nd SAS carried out a raid on a German Corps headquarters in the Po Valley, which succeeded in killing the corps chief of staff. The Second World War in Europe ended on 8 May by that time the SAS brigade had suffered 330 casualties, but had killed or wounded 7,733 and captured 23,000 of their enemies. Later the same month 1st and 2nd SAS were sent to Norway to disarm the 300,000 strong German garrison and 5th SAS were in Denmark and Germany on counter intelligence operations. The brigade was dismantled soon afterwards, in September the Belgian 5th SAS were handed over to the reformed Belgian Army. On 1 October the 3rd and 4th French SAS were handed over to the French Army and on 8 October the British 1st and 2nd SAS regiments were disbanded. Malaya Men of 22 SAS in Malaya. At the end of the war the British Government could see no need for a SAS type regiment, however, in 1946 it was decided that there was a need for a long term deep penetration commando or SAS unit. A new SAS regiment was raised as part of the Territorial Army.Shortt & McBride, p. 17 The regiment chosen to take on the SAS mantle was the Artists Rifles. The new 21 SAS Regiment came into existence on 1 January 1947 and took over the Artists Rifles headquarters at Dukes Road, Euston.Shortt & McBride, p. 18 In 1950 they raised a squadron to fight in the Korean War. After three months training, they were informed that the squadron would not, after all, be needed in Korea, and instead were sent to serve in the Malayan Emergency. On arrival in Malaya they came under the command of the wartime SAS Brigade commander, Mike Calvert. They became B Squadron, Malayan Scouts (SAS), the other units were A Squadron, which had been formed from 100 local volunteers mostly ex Second World War SAS and Chindits and C Squadron formed from volunteers from Rhodesia, the so-called 'Happy Hundred'. By 1956 the Regiment had been enlarged to five squadrons with the addition of D Squadron and the Parachute Regiment Squadron After three years service the Rhodesians returned home and were replaced by a New Zealand squadron.Shortt & McBride, p.20 A squadron were based at Ipoh while B and C squadrons were at Johore, during training they pioneered techniques of resupply by helicopter and also set up the \\"Hearts and Minds\\" campaign to win over the locals with medical teams going from village to village treating the sick. With the aid of Iban trackers from Borneo they became experts at surviving in the jungle.Shott & McBride, p. 19 In 1951 the Malayan Scouts (SAS) had successfully recruited enough men to form a Regimental Headquarters, a headquarters squadron and four operational squadrons over 900 men.de B. Taillon, p.29 The regiment was tasked to seek, find, fix then destroy the terrorists and prevent their infiltration into protected areas. Their tactics would be long range patrols, ambush and tracking the terrorists to their bases. They trained and acquired skills in treejumping, this involved parachuting into the thick jungle canopy and letting your parachute catch on the branches. Brought to a halt the parachutist then cut himself free and lowered himself to the ground by rope. Using inflatable boats for river patrolling, jungle fighting techniques, psychological warfare and booby trapping terrorist supplies. Calvert was invalided back to the United Kingdom in 1951 and replaced by Lieutenant- Colonel John Sloane. In February 1951, 54 men from B Squadron carried out the first parachute drop in the campaign in Operation Helsby, which was a major offensive in the River Perak–Belum valley, just south of the Thai border. The need for a regular army SAS regiment had been recognised, the Malayan Scouts (SAS) were renamed 22 SAS Regiment and formally added to the army list in 1952.Griffin, p. 150 However B Squadron was disbanded leaving just A and D Squadrons in service Oman and Borneo In 1958 the SAS got a new commander Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony Deane-Drummond.Shott & McBride, p. 21 The Malaya campaign was winding down, so they dispatched two squadrons from Malaya to assist in Oman. In January 1959 A Squadron defeated a large Guerrilla force on the Sabrina plateau. A victory that was kept from the public due to political and military sensitivities.de B. Taillon, p. 30 After Oman 22 SAS Regiment were recalled to the United Kingdom, the first time the regiment had served in there since their formation. They were initially barracked in Malvern Worcestershire before moving to Hereford in 1960. Just prior to this the third SAS regiment was formed and like 21 SAS was part of the Territorial Army. 23 SAS Regiment was formed by the renaming of the Joint Reserve Reconnaissance Unit, which itself had succeeded MI.9 via a series of units (POW Rescue, Recovery and Interrogation Unit, Intelligence School 9 and the Joint Reserve POW Intelligence Organisation) Behind this change was the understanding that passive networks of escape lines had little place in the cold war world and henceforth personnel behind the lines would be rescued by specially trained units. The regiment was sent to Borneo for the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, where they adopted the tactics of patrolling up to over the Indonesian border and used local tribesman for intelligence gathering. They at times lived in the indigenous tribes villages for five months gaining their trust. This involved showing respect for the Headman, giving gifts and providing medical treatment for the sick.de B. Taillon, p. 31 Mirbat castle site of the Battle of Mirbat In December 1963, the SAS went onto the offensive, now under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Woodhouse they adopted a \\"shoot and scoot\\" policy to keep SAS casualties to a minimum.de B. Taillon, p.32 They were augmented by the adding to their strength of the Guards Independent Parachute Company and later the Gurkha Independent Parachute Company. In 1964 Operation Claret was initiated, soldiers were selected from the infantry regiments in theatre, placed under SAS command and known as \\"Killer Groups\\". These groups would cross the border and penetrate up to disrupting the Indonesian Army build up, forcing them to move away from the border. Reconnaissance patrols were used to enter enemy territory to identify supply routes, enemy locations and enemy boat traffic. Captain Robin Letts was awarded the Military Cross for his role in leading a reconnaissance patrol which successfully ambushed the enemy near Babang Baba in April 1965. The Borneo campaign cost the British 59 killed 123 wounded compared to the Indonesian 600 dead. In 1964 B Squadron was re-formed from a combination of former members still with the Regiment and new recruits. The SAS returned to Oman in 1970. The Marxist controlled South Yemen government were supporting an insurgency in the Dhofar region that became known as the Dhofar Rebellion. Operating under the umbrella of a British Army Training Team (BATT), they recruited, trained and commanded the local Firquts. Firquts were local tribesmen and recently surrendered enemy soldiers. This new campaign ended shortly after the Battle of Mirbat in 1972, when a small SAS force and Firquts defeated 250 Adoo guerrillas. Northern Ireland In 1969 D Squadron, 22 SAS deployed to Northern Ireland for just over a month. The SAS returned in 1972 when small numbers of men were involved in intelligence gathering. The first squadron fully committed to the Province was in 1976 and by 1977 two squadrons were operating in Northern Ireland.de B. Taillon, p.35 These squadrons used well armed covert patrols in unmarked civilian cars. Within a year four terrorists had been killed or captured and another six forced to move south into the Republic. Members of the SAS are also believed to have served in the 14 Intelligence Company based in Northern Ireland.Geraghty, p. 130 The first operation attributed to the SAS was the arrest of Sean McKenna 12 March 1975. McKenna claims he was sleeping in a house just south of the Irish border when he was woken in the night by two armed men and forced across the border, while the SAS claimed he was found wandering in a field drunk.Geraghty, pp. 119–120 Their second operation was on 15 April 1976 with the arrest and killing of Peter Cleary. Cleary, an IRA staff officer, was detained by five in a field waiting for a helicopter to land. While four men guided the aircraft in Cleary started to struggle with his guard, attempted to seize his rifle and was shot.Geraghty, p. 120 The SAS returned to Northern Ireland in force in 1976, operating throughout the province. In January 1977 Seamus Harvey armed with a shotgun was killed on a SAS ambush.Geraghty, p.123 On 21 June six men from G Squadron, ambushed four IRA men planting a bomb at a government building, three were shot and killed but their driver managed to escape.Geraghty, pp.123–124 On 10 July 1978, John Boyle, a sixteen-year-old Catholic, was exploring an old graveyard near his family's farm in County Antrim, when he discovered an arms cache. He told his father, who passed on the information to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The next morning Boyle decided to see if the guns had been removed and was shot dead by two SAS soldiers who had been waiting undercover.Geraghty, p. 124 In 1976 Newsweek also reported that eight SAS men had been arrested in the Republic of Ireland supposedly as a result of a navigational error. It was later revealed that they had been in pursuit of a Provisional Irish Republican Army unit. The SAS's early successes led to increasing paranoia within Republican circles, as the PIRA hunted for informers they felt certain were in their midst.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 14, On 2 May 1980 Captain Herbert Westmacott, became the highest-ranking member of the SAS to be killed in Northern Ireland. He was in command of an eight-man plain clothes SAS patrol that had been alerted by the Royal Ulster Constabulary that an IRA gun team had taken over a house in Belfast.Bowyer Bell, pp. 487–488 A car carrying three SAS men went to the rear of the house, and another car carrying five SAS men went to the front of the house.Murray, p.256 As the SAS arrived at the front of the house the IRA unit opened fire with an M60 machine gun, hitting Captain Westmacott in the head and shoulder killing him instantly. The remaining SAS men at the front returned fire, but were forced to withdraw. One member of the IRA team was apprehended by the SAS at the rear of the house, preparing the unit's escape in a transit van, while the other three IRA members remained inside the house.Dillon, p. 94. More members of the security forces were deployed to the scene, and after a brief siege the remaining members of the IRA unit surrendered. After his death Westmacott was posthumously awarded the Military Cross. for gallantry in Northern Ireland during the period 1 February 1980 to 30 April 1980. Some sources say that the terrorists waved a white flag before the siege in an attempt to trick the SAS patrol into thinking they were surrendering.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 15, The Regiment increased their operational focus on Northern Ireland, with a small element known as the Ulster Troop that were permanently stationed in Northern Ireland to provide specialist support to the British Army and RUC. The troop consisted of around 20 operators and associated support personnel, serving on a rotational basis. For larger pre-planned operations, Ulster Troop was reinforced by SAS personnel, often in small 2 or 3-man teams from the Special Projects Team. From 1980, the Troop served twelve-month tours instead of six-month tours, as it was felt that longer deployments allowed the operators to develop and maintain a better understanding of the key factions and senior PIRA terrorists. Surveillance became an important aspect of the Troop, 14 Intelligence & Security Company (commonly known as \\"The Det\\") often carried out surveillance missions that led to SAS ambushes. On 4 December 1983 an SAS patrol found two IRA gunmen who were both armed, one with an Armalite rifle and the other a shotgun. These two men did not respond when challenged so the patrol opened fire, killing the two men. A third man who escaped in a car was believed to have been wounded. The SAS conducted a large number of operations officially called \\"OP/React\\": acting on information provided by a range of sources, including informers and technical intelligence; The Det, MI5 and the RUC's E4a surveillance unit would target and track ASU terrorists until a terrorist operation was thought to be imminent; at that point the SAS were handed control and would plan an arrest operation, if the terrorists were armed and did not comply they were engaged. In December 1984, an SAS team killed two ASU terrorists who were attempting to assassinate a reserve soldier outside a hospital he worked at. In February 1985, 3 SAS operators killed 3 ASU terrorists in Strabane, the terrorists were tasked with attacking a RUC Land Rover with anti-tank grenades, having failed to find a suitable target they were visiting a weapons cache to store their weapons. There was considerable media speculation during the troubles allegations of so-called \\"shoot-to-kill\\" policy by the SAS, the allegations mainly focus on whether a terrorist could have been captured alive rather than killed. The PIRA never took prisoners except for the worst intentions and after the 1980 death of Captain Westmacott and the death of an SAS member in December 1984, the Regiment appeared to adopt an unofficial policy of what Mark Urban quoted SAS sources as calling \\"Big boys' games- big boys' rules\\": if you're an armed terrorist you can expect no quarter to be given.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , pp. 14–16, On 8 May 1987, the SAS conducted Operation Judy which resulted in the IRA/ASUNeville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p.16, suffering its worst single loss of men, when eight men were killed by the SAS while attempting to attack the Loughgall police station. The SAS had been informed of the attack and 24 men waited in ambush positions around and inside the police station. They opened fire when the armed IRA unit approached the station with a bomb, its fuse lit, in the bucket of a hijacked JCB digger. A civilian passing the incident was also killed by SAS fire. In the late 1980s the IRA started to move operations to the European mainland. Operation Flavius in March 1988, was an SAS operation in Gibraltar in which three PIRA volunteers, Seán Savage, Daniel McCann and Mairéad Farrell, were killed. All three had conspired to detonate a car bomb where a military band assembled for the weekly changing of the guard at the governor's residence. In Germany, in 1989 the German security forces discovered a SAS unit operating there without the permission of the German government.Charters, p. 50 In 1991 three IRA men were killed by the SAS. The IRA men were on their way to kill an Ulster Defence Regiment soldier, who lived in Coagh, when they were ambushed. These three and another seven brought the total number of IRA men killed by the SAS in the 1990s to 11.Geraghty, pp. 127–128 Counter terrorist wing In the early 1970s the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Edward Heath asked the Ministry of Defence to prepare for any possible terrorist attack similar to the 1972 Munich massacre at the Munich Olympic Games and ordered that the SAS Counter Revolutionary Warfare (CRW) wing be established,de B. Taillon, p.38 in a little over a month the first 20-man SAS Counter Terrorist (CT) unit was ready to respond to any potential incident within the UK or abroad. Originally, it was known as the Pagoda Team (named after Operation Pagoda, the codename for the development of the SAS CT capability) and was initially composed of members from all squadrons, particularly members who had experience in the Regiment's Bodyguarding Cell but was soon placed under the control of the CRW.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p.9, Once the wing had been established each squadron would in turn rotate through counter terrorist training. The training included live firing exercises, hostage rescue and siege breaking. It was reported that during CRW training each soldier would expend 100,000 pistol rounds and would return to the CRW role on average every 16 months. The CRW initially consisted of a single SAS officer tasked with monitoring terrorism developments, but which was soon expanded and trimmed in size to a single troop strength; British technical experts developed a number of innovations for the team, including the first \\"flashbang\\" or \\"stun\\" grenade and the earliest examples of Frangible ammunition. =Home operations= Their first home deployment came on 7 January 1975, when an Iranian armed with a replica pistol hijacked a British Airways BAC One-Eleven landed at Stansted Airport, the hijacker was captured alive with no shots fired, the only casualty was an SAS soldier who was bitten by a police dog as he left the airliner. They also deployed during the Balcombe Street Siege, where the Metropolitan Police had trapped a PIRA unit. Hearing on the BBC that the SAS were being deployed the PIRA men surrendered. Iranian Embassy siege The Iranian Embassy Siege started at 11:30 on 30 April 1980 when a six-man team calling itself the 'Democratic Revolutionary Movement for the Liberation of Arabistan' (DRMLA), captured the embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Prince's Gate, South Kensington in central London. When the group first stormed the building, 26 hostages were taken, but five were released over the following few days. On the sixth day of the siege the kidnappers killed a hostage. This marked an escalation of the situation and prompted Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's decision to proceed with the rescue operation. The order to deploy the SAS was given, and B Squadron the duty CRW squadron were alerted. When the first hostage was shot, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, David McNee passed a note signed by Thatcher to the Ministry of Defence, stating this was now a \\"military operation\\". It was known as Operation Nimrod.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 8, The rescue mission started at 19:23, 5 May when the SAS assault troops at the front gained access to the embassy's first floor balcony via the roof. Another team assembled on the ground floor terrace entered via the rear of the embassy. After forcing entry five of the six terrorists were killed. Unfortunately one of the hostages was also killed by the terrorists during the assault which lasted 11 minutes. The events were broadcast live on national television and soon rebroadcast around the world gaining fame and a reputation for the SAS,de B. Taillon, p44 that prior to the assault few outside of the military special operations community even knew of the regiments existence.Thompson, p. 8 Peterhead prison On 28 September 1987 a riot in D wing Peterhead Prison resulted in prisoners taking over the building and taking a prison officer, 56-year-old Jackie Stuart, hostage. The rioters were serving life in prison for violent crimes. It was thought that they had nothing to lose and would not hesitate to make good on their threats to kill their hostage, whom they had now taken up to the rafters of the Scottish prison. When negotiations broke down, the then Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, dispatched the SAS to bring the riot to an end on 3 October. The CRW troops arrived by helicopter landed on the roof then abseiled into the prison proper. Armed only with pistols, batons and stun grenades they brought the riot to a swift closure. Hijacking of Ariana Afghan Airlines flight 805 On 6 February 2000, a Boeing 727 operated by Ariana Afghan Airlines was hijacked by a number of Afghan nationals who wish to escape the country and to obtain the release of a Mujahedeen warlord imprisoned Taliban. The flight landed at Stanstead Airport and the on-call SAS CT team arrived, they linked up with armed police and began developing Immediate Action (IA) and Direct Action (DA) plans. Neither were required as the hijackers eventually surrendered.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 11, War on Terror in the UK In 2005 London was the target of two attacks on the 7 July and 21 July. It was reported in Times that the SAS CRW played a role in the capture of three men suspected of taking part in the failed 21 July bomb attacks. Providing expertise in explosive entry techniques to back up raids by police firearms officers. It was also reported that plain clothes SAS teams were monitoring airports and main railway stations to identify any security weaknesses and they were using civilian helicopters and two small executive jets to move around the country. Following the bombings, a small forward element of the CRW was permanently deployed to the capital to provide immediate assistance to the Metropolitan Police Service in the event of a terrorist incident. This unit is supported by its own attached Ammunition technical officer trained in high-risk search and making safe car bombs and improvised explosive devices, along with a technical intelligence cell capable of sophisticated interception of all forms of communication. In particular, after 21 July bombings, several SAS elements trained in explosive methods of entry were dispatched to support the Metropolitan Police firearms unit, and were used to explosively breach two flats where would-be suicide bombers had taken refuge, the police fired CS gas into both premises and negotiated the surrender of all suspects.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, pp. 11–12 The police retain primacy and are the lead in the event of a terrorist attack on British soil, the military will provide support if requested, if a situation is deemed to be outside the capabilities of police firearms units (such as a requirement for specialist breaching capabilities), the SAS will be called in under the Military Aid to the Civil Authorities legislation. Additionally, some categories of operation-such as the recapture of hijacked airlines or cruise ships, or the recovery of nuclear or radioactive IEDs remain a military responsibility.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, p.12 The Telegraph reported on 4 June 2017 that following the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017, small numbers of SAS soldiers supported police and accompanied officers on raids around the city. Following the London Bridge attack, an SAS unit nicknamed 'Blue Thunder' arrived after the attack had been ended by armed police. A Eurocopter AS365 N3 Dauphin helicopter landed on London Bridge carrying what a Whitehall source confirmed were carrying SAS troops. =Overseas operations= Nations around the world particularly wanted a Counter terrorism capability like the SAS, the Ministry of Defence and Foreign and Commonwealth Office often loan out training teams from the Regiment, particularly to the Gulf States to train bodyguard teams-now focused on CT. The Regiment have had a long-standing association with the US Army's Delta Force, with the two units have often having swapped techniques and tactics, as well as conducting join training exercises in North America and Europe. Other nations CT units developed close ties with the Regiment, including the Australian SAS, New Zealand SAS, GSG 9 and GIGN.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , pp. 9–10, The first documented action by the CRW Wing was assisting the West German counter- terrorism group GSG 9 at Mogadishu.Schorley & Forsyth, p. 12 Eventually the CRW grew into full squadron strength and included its own support elements- Explosive Ordnance Disposal, search and combat dogs, medics and attached intelligence and targeting cell. Along with overseas training missions, the Regiment also sends small teams to act as observers and to provide advice or technical input if required at the scenes of terrorist and similar incidents worldwide.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 10, The Gambia In August 1981 a 2-man SAS team was covertly deployed to The Gambia to help put down a coup. Colombian conflict During the late 1980s members of the Regiment were dispatched to Colombia to train Colombian special operations forces in counter-terrorism and counter- narcotics operations. As of 2017, the training teams missions remain classified; rumours that SAS operators, with their US counterparts, accompanied Colombian forces on jungle operations, but this hasn't been confirmed. Waco siege In 1993, SAS and Delta Force operators were deployed as observers in the Waco siege in Texas. Air France Flight 8969 In December 1994, the SAS were deployed as observers when Air France Flight 8969 was hijacked by GIA terrorists, the crisis was eventually resolved by GIGN. Japanese embassy hostage crisis In early 1997, six members of the SAS were sent to Peru during the Japanese embassy hostage crisis due to diplomatic personnel being among the hostages and also to observe and advise Peruvian commandos in Operation Chavín de Huántar- the release of hostages by force. Falklands War The Falklands War started after the Argentina occupation of the Falkland Islands on 2 April 1982. Brigadier Peter de la Billière the Director Special Forces and Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Rose, the Commander of 22 SAS Regiment, petitioned for the regiment to be included in the task force. Without waiting for official approval D Squadron which was on standby for worldwide operations, departed on 5 April for Ascension Island.Freedman, p. 224 They were followed by G Squadron on 20 April. As both squadrons sailed south the plans were for D Squadron to support operations to retake South Georgia while G Squadron would be responsible for the Falkland Islands. By virtue of a 1981 transfer from A Squadron to G squadron, John Thompson was the only one of the 55 SAS soldiers involved in the Iranian siege to also see action in the Falklands.http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local- news/sas-falklands-veteran-shocked-tv-2058664 =South Georgia= South Georgia Islands Operation Paraquet was the code name for the first land to be liberated in the conflict. South Georgia is an island to the south east of the Falkland Islands and one of the Falkland Islands Dependencies. In atrocious weather the SAS, SBS and Royal Marines forced the Argentinian garrison to surrender. On 22 April Westland Wessex helicopters landed a SAS unit on the Fortuna Glacier. This resulted in the loss of two of the helicopters, one on takeoff and one crashed into the glacier in almost zero visibility. The SAS unit were defeated by the weather and terrain and had to be evacuated after only managing to cover in five hours.Freedman, p. 238 The following night a SBS section succeeded in landing by helicopter and Boat Troop, D Squadron, SAS set out in five Gemini inflatable boats for the island. Two boats suffered engine failure with one crew being picked up by helicopter and the other crew got to shore. The next day 24 April a force of 75 SAS, SBS and Royal Marines advancing with naval gunfire support, reached Grytviken and forced the occupying Argentinians to surrender. The following day the garrison at Leith also surrendered.Smith, pp. 51–52 =Main landings= Prior to the landing eight reconnaissance patrols from G Squadron had been landed on East Falkland between 30 April and 2 May.Freedman, p. 273 The main landings were at San Carlos on 21 May. To cover the landings D Squadron mounted a major diversionary raid at Goose Green and Darwin with fire support from . After D Squadron were returning from their raid they shot down a FMA IA 58 Pucará with a shoulder-launched Stinger missile that had overflown their location. While the main landings were taking place a four-man patrol from G Squadron had been carrying out a reconnaissance near Stanley. They located an Argentinian helicopter dispersal area between Mount Kent and Mount Estancia. Advising to attack at first light, the resulting attack by RAF Harrier GR3's from No. 1 Squadron RAF destroyed one CH-47 Chinook and the two Aérospatiale Puma helicopters. The Falkland Islands =Pebble Island= Over the night 14/15 May D Squadron SAS carried out the raid on Pebble Island airstrip on West Falkland. The force of 20 men from Mountain Troop, D Squadron, led by Captain John Hamilton, destroyed six FMA IA 58 Pucarás, four T-34 Mentors and a Short SC.7 Skyvan transport. The attack was supported by fire from . Under cover of mortar and small arms fire the SAS moved onto the airstrip and fixed explosive charges to the aircraft. Casualties were light one Argentinian was killed and two of the Squadron were wounded by shrapnel when a mine exploded.Smith, pp. 64–65 =Sea King Crash= On 19 May, the SAS suffered its worst loss since the Second World War. A Westland Sea King helicopter crashed while cross- decking troops from to , killing 22 men. Approaching HMS Hermes, it appeared to have an engine failure and crashed into the sea. Only nine men managed to scramble out of a side door before the helicopter sank. They were the only survivors. Rescuers found bird feathers floating on the surface where the helicopter had hit the water. It is thought that the Sea King was the victim of a bird strike. Of the 22 killed 18 were from the SAS, one from the Royal Signals and the Royal Air Force pilot.Kennedy, p. 229 =Operation Mikado= Operation Mikado was the code name for the planned landing of B Squadron, SAS at the Argentinian airbase at Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego. The initial plan was to crash land two C-130 Hercules carrying B Squadron onto the runway at Port Stanley to bring the conflict to a rapid conclusion.Kennedy, pp. 209–210 B Squadron arrived at Ascension Island 20 May the day after the fatal Sea King crash. They were just boarding the C-130s when word came that the operation had been cancelled.Kennedy, p. 213 B Squadron team parachute from a C-130 Hercules into the South Atlantic After Mikado had been cancelled B Squadron were called upon to parachute into the South Atlantic to reinforce D Squadron. They were transported south by the two C-130s equipped with long-range fuel tanks. Only one of the aircraft reached the jump point the other had to turn back with fuel problems. The parachutists were then transported to the Falkland Islands by .Kennedy, pp. 215–217 =West Falkland= Mountain Troop, D Squadron SAS deployed onto West Falkland to observe the two Argentine garrisons. One of the patrols was commanded by Captain John Hamilton who had commanded the raid on Pebble Island. On 10 June Hamilton and patrol were in an observation point near Port Howard when they were attacked by Argentine forces. Two of the patrol managed to get away but Hamilton and his signaller, Sergeant Fosenka, were pinned down. Hamilton was hit in the back by enemy fire and told Fosenka \\"you carry on, I'll cover your back\\". Moments later Hamilton was killed. Sergeant Fosenka was later captured when he ran out of ammunition. The senior Argentine officer praised the heroism of Hamilton who was posthumously awarded the Military Cross. =Wireless Ridge= The last major action for the SAS was a raid on East Falkland on the night of 14 June. This involved a diversionary raid by D and G Squadron against Argentinian positions North of Stanley, while 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment assaulted Wireless Ridge. Their objective was to set up a mortar and machine gun fire base to provide fire support, while the D Sqdn Boat Troop and six SBS men crossed Port William water in Rigid Raiders to destroy the fuel tanks at Cortley Hill. After firing Milan and GPMG onto the target areas the ground assault team came under Anti Aircraft machine gun fire, the water assault group were also hit by a hail of small arms fire, all their boats were hit and three men wounded forcing them to withdraw. At the same time the fire base came under an Argentinian artillery and infantry attack, the Argentinian unit had not been seen from the long range surveillance of the area as they were dug in on the reverse slope. They then had to call upon their own artillery to silence the Argentinian guns to enable G Squadron to withdraw. The raid was to harass the Argentinian ground forces and was a success, Argentinian artillery continued to land on the SAS assault position and the route the squadron took on its exfiltration for an hour after they had withdrawn and not on the attacking parachute battalion.Freedman, pp. 641–642 Cambodian–Vietnamese War Between 1985 and 1989, members of the SAS were dispatched to Southeast Asia train a number of Cambodian insurgent groups to fight against the People's Army of Vietnam who were occupying Cambodia after ousting the Khmer Rouge regime. The SAS did not directly train any members of the Khmer Rouge, but questions were raised in amidst the \\"murky\\" factional politics as to the relationship between some of the insurgent groups and the Khmer Rouge.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 20, Gulf War Bravo Two Zero patrol members The Gulf War started after the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August 1990. The British military response to the invasion was Operation Granby; General Norman Schwarzkopf, was adamant that the use of special operations forces in Operation Desert Storm would be limited, this was due to his experiences in the Vietnam War-where he had seen special operations forces missions go badly wrong, requiring conventional forces to rescue them. Lieutenant-general Peter de la Billière, Schwarzkopf deputy and former member of the SAS, requested the deployment of the Regiment, despite not having a formal role.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , pp. 20–21, The SAS deployment included more than 300Ashcroft, Michael, Special Forces Heroes, Headline Review, 2009 , p. 278 SAS members, mainly from A, B and D squadrons 22 Special Air Service Regiment, members of R Squadron were also deployed. Which was the largest SAS mobilisation since the Second World War. There was conflict in the Regiment over whether to deploy A or G squadron to the Gulf: In August 1990, A squadron had just returned from a deployment to Colombia, whereas G squadron were the logical choice to deploy because they were on SP rotation and had just returned from desert training exercises. However, since A squadron were not involved in the Falklands War, they were deployed. De la Billière and the commander of UKSF for Operation Granby planned to convince Schwarzkopf of the need for special operations forces with the rescue of a large number of Western and Kuwaiti civilian workers being held by Iraqi forces as human shields, but in December 1990, Saddam Hussein released the majority of the hostages, however the situation brought the SAS to Schwarzkopf's attention. Having already allowed US Army Special Forces and Marine Force Recon to conduct long-range reconnaissance missions, he was eventually convinced to allow the SAS to also deploy a handful of reconnaissance teams to monitor the Main Supply Routes (MSRs).Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 21, Initial plans were for the SAS to carry out their traditional raiding role behind the Iraqi lines, and operate ahead of the allied invasion, disrupting lines of communications. The SAS operated from Al Jawf, on 17 January, 128 members of A and D squadron moved to the frontlineAshcroft, Michael, Special Forces Heroes, Headline Review, 2009 , p283-284 there they inserted three road-watch teams into western Iraq to establish observation of the MSR traffic on 18 January 1991, the first eight SCUD-B ballistic missiles with conventional explosive warheads fell on Tel Aviv and Haifa, Israel, it was this attempt to bring Israel into the war to undermine the coalition by shattering the coalition of Arab nations arrayed against Iraq, that was directly responsible for a dramatic increase in operations for the Regiment. On that day they were tasked with hunting Scuds. An operational area, known as \\"SCUD Box,\\" covered a huge swathe of western Iraq south of main Highway 10 MSR, was allocated to the SAS and nicknamed \\"SCUD Alley\\", Delta Force deployed north of Highway 10 in \\"SCUD Boulevard,\\" two flights of USAF F-15Es on \\"SCUD Watch\\" would be their main air support component. Both SAS and Delta operations were initially hampered by delays in bringing strike aircraft onto the often time sensitive targets-a problem only partially alleviated by the placing of special forces liaisons with the US Air Force in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , pp. 21–23, On 20 January, they were working behind Iraqi lines hunting for Scud missile launchers in the area south of the Amman — Baghdad highway.Atkinson, p. 177 The patrols working on foot and in landrovers would at times carry out their own attacks, with MILAN missiles on Scud launchers and also set up ambushes for Iraqi convoys, The half of B squadron in al-Jauf, Saudi Arabia, were given the task of establishing covert observation posts along the MSR in three-eight-man patrols inserted by helicopter.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 23, On 22 January three eight-man patrols from B Squadron were inserted behind the lines by a Chinook helicopter. Their mission was to locate Scud launchers and monitor the main supply route. One of the patrols, Bravo Two Zero, had decided to patrol on foot. The patrol was found by an Iraqi unit and, unable to call for help because they had been issued the wrong radio frequencies, had to try to evade capture by themselves. The team under command of Andy McNab suffered three dead and four captured; only one man, Chris Ryan, managed to escape to Syria. Ryan made SAS history with the \\"longest escape and evasion by an SAS trooper or any other soldier\\", covering more than SAS trooper John 'Jack' William Sillito, had in the Sahara Desert in 1942. The other patrols, Bravo One Zero and Bravo Three Zero, had opted to use landrovers and take in more equipment returned intact to Saudi Arabia.Ryan (1995), p. 16 Meanwhile, A and D squadron mobile patrols were tracking down SCUDs and destroying them if possible, or vector-in strike aircraft. Both squadrons were equipped with six to eight Desert Patrol Vehicles (DPVs) in four mobile patrols/fighting columns. The mobile patrols used the \\"mothership\\" concept to resupply their mounted patrols, along with the DPVs, a number of cut-down Unimog and ACMAT VLRA trucks were infiltrated into the area of operations and served as mobile resupply points, themselves being stocked with fuel, ammunition and water by RAF Chinook drops, this meant that the SAS mobility patrols could effectively stay in the area of operations indefinitely. During one mission an operator reportedly destroyed a SCUD launcher with a vehicle-mounted Milan anti-tank guided missile. An Iraqi Army command-and-control site known as \\"Victor Two\\" was attacked by the SAS: SAS operators crept in to the facility and set a batch of demolition charges which were counting down to detonation when they were compromised, the SAS destroyed Iraqi bunkers with Milans and LAW rockets, operators engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Iraqi soldiers. The operators broke cover and braved enemy fire to reach their vehicles and escape before the demolition exploded. Another mounted patrol from D squadron was bedding down for the night in a desert wadi, later they discovered they were camped next to an Iraqi communications facility, they were quickly compromised by an Iraqi soldier walking to their position. A firefight erupted between the SAS and at least two regular Iraqi Army infantry platoons. The patrol managed to break contact after disabling two Iraqi technicals (pick-up trucks) that attempted to pursue them, during the chaos of the firefight a supply Unimog had been immobilised by enemy fire and left behind with no sign of the seven missing crew members. The seven SAS operators (one of whom was severely wounded) had captured a damaged Iraqi technical and drove toward the Saudi Arabian border, eventually the vehicle ground to a halt and the men were forced to travel on foot, after 5 days they reached the border.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 23, pp. 25–26, p. 29 The desert units were resupplied by a temporary formation known as E squadron, this were made up of Bedford 4-ton trucks and heavily armed SAS Land Rovers. They drove from Saudi Arabia on 10 February, rendezvousing with SAS units some 86 miles inside Iraq on 12 February, returning to Saudi Arabia on 17 February.Cawthorne, Nigel, The Mammoth Book of Inside the Elite Forces, Robinson, 2008 members of 21 and 23 SAS were used as battlefield casualty replacements for deployed 22 SAS units, namely landrover fighting columns from A and D Squadrons who were operating in the Iraqi Desert. Days before the cessation of hostilities, an SAS operator was shot in the chest and killed in an ambush. The Regiment had operated in Iraq for some 43 days, despite the poor state of mapping, reconnaissance imagery, intelligence and weather; additional problems such as the lack of essential kit such as night-vision goggles, TACBE radios and GPS units, they appear to have been instrumental in stopping the SCUDs. There were no further launches after only two days of SAS operations in their assigned \\"box,\\" despite this, significant questions remain over how many SCUDs were actually destroyed either from the air or on the ground, the Iraqis had deployed large numbers of East German-manufactured decoy vehicles and apparently several oil tankers were erroneously targeted from the air. Despite a US Air Force study arguing that no actual SCUDs were destroyed, the SAS maintain that what they destroyed, often at relative close range, were not decoys and oil tankers. Undoubtedly, the Regiment succeeded in forcing SCUDs to move out of the \\"SCUD Box\\" and into north-west Iraq and the increased distances, for an inaccurate and unreliable missile system effectively eliminated the SCUD threat. General Schwarzkopf sent a personal message thanking the Regiment and Delta Force saying \\"You guys kept Israel out of the war.\\"Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 26, 28–29 By the end of the war, four SAS men had been killed and five captured.Atkinson, p. 178 The SAS perfected desert mobility techniques during Operation Granby; it would influence US Army Special Forces during initial operations in Afghanistan and Iraq a decade later.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 29 Yugoslav Wars =Bosnian War= In 1994–95, Lieutenant-general Michael Rose, who had been the CO of 22 SAS and Director Special Forces (DSF) during the 1980s, commanded the United Nations Protection Force mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, needing a realistic appreciation of the situation in a number of UN-mandated \\"safe areas\\" that were surrounded by Bosnian-Serb forces, he requested and received elements from both A and D squadrons. The operators deployed with standard British Army uniforms, UN blue berets and SA80 assault rifles to \\"hide in plain sight\\" under the official cover as UK Liaison Officers. They established the \\"ground truth\\" in the besieged enclaves. As these men were trained as forward air controllers, they were also equipped with laser target designators to guide NATO aircraft should the decision be made to engage Bosnian-Serb forces. During the Siege of Goražde, an SAS operator in UN dress, was shot and killed as a patrol attempted to survey Bosnian-Serb positions. On 16 April 1994, as part of Operation Deny Flight, a Royal Navy Sea Harrier FRS.1 of 801 NAS flying from HMS Ark Royal was shot down by a Serbian SA-7 SAM but its pilot was rescued by a four-man SAS team operating within Goražde. The same team called in a number of airstrikes on armoured columns entering the city, until they were forced to escape through the lines of encircling Serbian paramilitaries to avoid capture and possible execution.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p.29-30 A two-man SAS reconnaissance team was covertly inserted into the UN \\"safe area\\" of Srebrenica where a Dutch UN battalion was supposedly protecting the population and thousands of Bosniak refugees from threatening Bosnian Serb forces. The SAS team attempted to call in airstrikes as Serbian forces attacked but were frustrated by UN bureaucracy and ineptitude, they were finally ordered to withdraw and the city fell to the Bosnian-Serb army led by General Ratko Mladić in July 1995, resulting in the genocidal execution of some 8,000 cilivans. The SAS patrol commander wrote a series of newspaper articles about the tragedy, but was successfully taken to court by the MoD in 2002 to stop the publication.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 30 In the aftermath of the Dayton Agreement in December 1995, the SAS remained active in the region, alongside JSOC units in the hunt for war criminals on behalf of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. One such operation in July 1997 resulted in the capture of one fugitive and the death of another when he opened fired on a plain clothed SAS team. Another wanted war criminal was captured by the Regiment in November 1998 from a remote safehouse in Serbia, he was driven to the Drina river separating Serbia from Bosnia before being transported across in an SAS Zodiac inflatable boat and helicoptered out the country. On 2 December 1998, General Radislav Krstić was travelling in a convoy near the village of Vrsari in the Republika Srpska in northern Bosnia when members of 22 SAS, backed-up by a Navy SEAL unit, blocked off the convoy, disabled Krstić's vehicle with spikes and arrested him.Jennings, Christian, Bosnia's Million Bones: Solving the World's Greatest Forensic Puzzle, Palgrave Macmillan, 2013, Reservists were deployed into the Balkans in the mid-1990s as a composite unit known as \\"V\\" Squadron where they took part in peace support operations, which allowed regular members of the SAS to be used for other tasks. =Kosovo War= The SAS deployed D squadron to Kosovo in 1999 to guide airstrikes by NATO aircraft and reconnoitre potential avenues of approach should a NATO ground force be committed. Members of G squadron were later dispatched into Kosovo from Macedonia to conduct advanced-force operations and assist in securing a number of bridgeheads in preparation for the larger NATO incursion. Following the Kosovo war, KFOR, the NATO-led international peacekeeping force which was responsible for establishing a secure environment in Kosovo. On 16 February 2001, a large explosive device blew up a coach travelling through Podujevo from Serbia carrying 57 Kosovo Serbs, killing 11 with a further 45 wounded and missing. The coach had been part of a convoy of 5 coaches, escorted by the Swedish military armoured vehicles under British command, the attack took place in a British Brigade Area; within hours; within hours Serbs within Kosovo formed crowds and began attacking Albanians. On 19 March 2001, 3,000 British and Norwegian troops arrested 22 Albanians suspected in the involvement of the bus attack, G squadron 22 SAS spearheaded the operation, the SAS were specifically requested because it was believed the suspects were armed, the SAS carried out the operation early in the morning, when most of the suspects were asleep.Lawrence, Richard Russell, The Mammoth Book of Special Ops: The 40 Most Dangerous Special Operations of Modern Times (Mammoth Books), Running Press, 2006, =2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia= In the spring of 2001, fighting between the NLA and Macedonia was intensifying; since at least March 2001, SAS teams observed the Kosovo- Macedonian border. Between July and August the violence escalated, the EU set up a peace deal to grant the 600,000 Albanian minority in Macedonia greater political and constitutional rights; a multinational NATO mission would also deploy to collect the weapons from the 2,500 NLA rebels. In mid August Several four-man SAS patrols accompanied 35 members of Pathfinder Platoon, 16 Air Assault Brigade, into rebel held areas in northern Macedonia, on 21 August, the paratroopers guided in two British army Lynx helicopters into the village of Šipkovica, who were carrying 3 British NATO leaders that met with rebel leaders to the negotiation of the disarmament. Following the negotiations, Ali Ahmeti, the leader of the NLA remarked that \\"perhaps discrimination against Albanians has come to an end;\\" the next day the NATO multinational force deployed to Macedonia under Operation Essential Harvest, between 27 August and 27 September they collected 3,000 weapons-successfully disarmed the rebels. Sierra Leone The SAS and the SBS were deployed Sierra Leone in support of Operation Palliser against the Revolutionary United Front. They had been on stand-by to effect the relief of a British Army Major and his team of UN observers from a besieged camp in the jungle; additionally, they conducted covert reconnaissance, discovering strengths and dispositions of the rebel forces.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 31, =Operation Barras= In 2000, a combined force of D squadron 22 SAS, SBS and men from 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment carried out a hostage rescue operation, code named Operation Barras. The objective was to rescue five members of 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment and a Sierra Leone liaison officer who were being held by a militia group known as the West Side Boys (there was a total of 11 hostages taken but six were released in preceding negotiations). The rescue team transported in three Chinook and one Lynx helicopter mounted a simultaneous two-pronged attack after reaching the militia positions. After a heavy fire fight, the hostages were released and flown back to the capital Freetown. One member of the SAS rescue team was killed during the operation. War on Terror Following the September 11 attacks by al-Qaeda in 2001, the U.S. and its allies began the \\"War on Terror\\"; an international campaign to defeat Islamist terrorism. =War in Afghanistan (2001–present)= Operations against the Taliban and al-Qaeda and other terrorists groups in Afghanistan began in October 2001. In mid-October 2001, A and G squadron of 22 SAS (at the time D squadron was SP duty, while B squadron was overseas on a long-term training exercise), reinforced by members of the 21 and 23 SAS, deployed to northwestern Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan under the command of CENTCOM. They conducted largely uneventful reconnaissance tasks under the codename Operation Determine, none of these tasks resulted in enemy contact; they travelled in Land Rover Desert Patrol Vehicles (known as Pinkies) and modified ATVs. After a fortnight and with missions drying up, both squadrons returned to their barracks in the UK. After political intersession with Prime minister Tony Blair, the SAS were given a direct-action task – the destruction of an al- Qaeda-linked opium plant in southern Afghanistan, their mission was codenamed Operation Trent. Both A and G squadron successfully completed the mission in 4 hours with only 4 soldiers wounded, it marked the regiments first wartime HALO parachute jump and the operation was the largest British SAS operation in history. Following Operation Trent, the SAS were deployed on uneventful reconnaissance tasks in the Dasht-e Margo desert, returning to Hereford in mid-December 2001; however, small numbers of Territorial SAS from both regiments remained in the country to provide close protection for members of MI6. One newspaper fuelled myth was that a British SAS squadron was at the Battle of Tora Bora, in fact, the only UKSF involved in the Battle was the SBS.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , pp. 49, 69–72, 75Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , pp. 32–33, In mid-December, the SAS escorted a reconnaissance and liaison team on a four-day visit to Kabul. The team was led by Brigadier Barney White-Spunner (commander of 16th Air Assault Brigade), who would assess the logistical challenges, and advise the composition of a UN-mandated force to 'assist in the maintenance of security for Kabul and its surrounding area', also in command of the team was Brigadier Peter Wall (from PJHQ) who would negotiate with the Northern Alliance.Farrell, Theo, Unwinnable: Britain’s War in Afghanistan, 2001–2014, Bodley Head, 2017 , P.92-93 On 7 January 2002, an SAS close-protection team escorted Prime minister Tony Blair and his wife whilst they met with Afghan President Karzai at Bagram Airfield.Farrell, Theo, Unwinnable: Britain’s War in Afghanistan, 2001–2014, Bodley Head, 2017 , p. 177 In 2002 the SAS was involved in operations in the Kwaja Amran mountain range in Ghazni Province and the Hada Hills near Spin Boldak, inserting by helicopter at night, storming villages and grabbing suspects for interrogation. During the period of Operation Jacana, a large proportion of the SAS contingent in Afghanistan fell victim to illness that affected hundreds of other British troops at Bagram Airfield, many had to be quarantined. For his conduct whilst leading the SAS in Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002, Lieutenant Colonel Ed Butler was awarded the DSO. Over the next three years, the SAS, operating with an Afghan counternarcotics force (which they trained and mentored) conducted frequent raids into Helmand province, closely coordinated with the ISAF-led PRT (Provisional Reconstruction Effort), which aimed to assist in creating the conditions for the building of a non-narco-based economy, while improving the political link between the province and the new government in Kabul. These efforts were later reinforced in 2004 by the New Zealand SAS, which patrolled northern Helmand in support of the US PRT efforts. During this period, the SAS teams and the US PRT gained a close familiarity with the province and its people, via a combination of 'hearts and minds'-focused patrolling and precise counternarcotics raiding, which focused on the traders/businessmen rather than poor farmers. They supported their missions with a field hospital, complete with specialist staff (as well as the occasional intelligence specialist), who offered medical assistance to Afghans-a programmed known as MEDCAP. This approach was said to have won over many Helmandis. In May 2003, G squadron deployed to Iraq to replace B and D squadron at the same time they deployed around a dozen of its soldiers to Afghanistan, every 22nd SAS squadron had this deployment establishment until 2005.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 , pp. 13–14 Also that year, it was revealed that reserve soldiers from 21 and 23 SAS Regiments were deployed, where they helped to establish a communications network across Afghanistan and also acted as liaison teams between the various political groups, NATO and the Afghan government. SAS reservists supported the British PRT in Mazar-e-Sharif that was established in July 2003 and staffed by 100 members of the Royal Anglian Regiment.Farrell, Theo, Unwinnable: Britain’s War in Afghanistan, 2001–2014, Bodley Head, 2017 , p. 134 After it was decided to deploy British troops to Helmand Province, PJHQ tasked A Squadron 22 SAS to conduct a reconnaissance of the province between April and May 2005. The review was led by Mark Carleton- Smith, who found the province largely at peace due to the brutal rule of Sher Mohammad Akhundzada, and a booming opium-fuelled economy that benefited the pro-government warlords. In June he reported back to the MoD warning them not to remove Akhundzada and against the deployment of a large British force which would likely cause conflict where none existed.Farrell, Theo, Unwinnable: Britain’s War in Afghanistan, 2001–2014, Bodley Head, 2017 , p. 233 In spring 2005, as part of a deployment re-balance, the Director of Special Forces decided to only deploy the 22nd SAS regiment to Iraq until at least the end of operations there, whilst British special forces deployments to Afghanistan would be the responsibility of the SBS; before this, a troop from an SAS squadron deployed to Iraq would be detached and deployed to Afghanistan.Urban, Mark. Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin. 2012. . . pp. 92–93, 115. In June 2008 a Land Rover transporting Corporal Sarah Bryant and SAS reserve soldiers Corporal Sean Reeve and Lance Corporals Richard Larkin and Paul Stout hit a mine in Helmand province, killing all four. In October Major Sebastian Morley, their commander in Afghanistan, resigned over what he described as \\"gross negligence\\" on the part of the Ministry of Defence that contributed to the deaths of four British troops under his command. Morley stated that the MoD's failure to properly equip his troops with adequate equipment forced them to use lightly armoured Snatch Land Rovers to travel around Afghanistan. SAS reservists were withdrawn from frontline duty in 2010. In December 2016, ABC news reported that the DEA's FAST (Foreign-Deployed Advisory Support Teams) teams initially operated in Afghanistan alongside the SAS to destroy small opium processing labs in remote areas of southern Afghanistan. Following the end of Operation Crichton in Iraq in 2009, two SAS squadrons were deployed to Afghanistan, where the Regiment would focus its operations.Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 49, The main objective of the SAS and other British special forces units with Afghan forces embedded was targeting Taliban leaders and drug barons using \\"Carrot and stick\\" tactics. In 2010, the SAS also took part in Operation Moshtarak, four-man SAS teams and U.S. Army Special Forces team ODA 1231 would perform \\"find, fix, strike\\" raids. These resulted in the deaths of 50 Taliban leaders in the area according to NATO, but did not seem to have any real adverse effect on the Taliban's operations. According to the London Sunday Times, as of March 2010 the United Kingdom Special Forces have suffered 12 killed and 70 seriously injured in Afghanistan and seven killed and 30 seriously injured in Iraq. In 2011, a senior British officer in Afghanistan confirmed that the SAS were \\"taking out 130–140 mid-level Taliban commanders every month.\\"Neville, Leigh, The SAS 1983–2014 (Elite), Osprey Publishing, 2016, , p. 50, On 12 July 2011, soldiers from the SAS captured two British-Afghans in a hotel in Herat; they were trying to join either the Taliban or al-Qaeda and are believed to be the first Britons to be captured alive in Afghanistan since 2001. British newspapers that drew on WikiLeaks data revealed the existence of a joint SBS/SAS task force based in Kandahar that was dedicated to conducting operations against targets on the JPEL; British Apache helicopters were frequently assigned to support this task force.Farrell, Theo, Unwinnable: Britain’s War in Afghanistan, 2001–2014, Bodley Head, 2017 , p. 330 On 28 May 2012, two teams: one from the SAS and another from DEVGRU carried out Operation Jubilee: the rescue of a British aid worked and 3 other hostages after they were captured by bandits and held in two separate caves in the Koh- e-Laram forest, Badakhshan Province, the assault force killed 11 gunmen and rescued all 4 hostages.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , pp. 265–266 In December 2014, the NATO officially ended combat operations in Afghanistan, however NATO personnel are remaining in the country to support Afghan forces in the new phase of the War in Afghanistan. The Telegraph reported that around 100 British Special Forces members including members of the SAS would remain in Afghanistan, along with US Special Forces in a counter-terrorist task force continuing to hunt down senior Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders. They are also assigned their to protect British officials and troops remaining in the country. In December 2015, it was reported that 30 members of the SAS alongside 60 US special forces operators joined the Afghan Army in the Battle to retake parts of Sangin from Taliban insurgents. =Kashmir conflict= In 2002, a team comprising Special Air Service and Delta Force personnel was sent into Indian-administered Kashmir to hunt for Osama bin Laden after reports that he was being sheltered by the Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul- Mujahideen. US officials believed that Al-Qaeda was helping organize a campaign of terror in Kashmir to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan.SAS joins Kashmir hunt for bin Laden, The Daily Telegraph, 23 February 2002 =Iraq War= The SAS took part in the 2003 invasion of Iraq under the codename: Operation Row, which was part of CJSOTF-West (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force – West)Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p. 89–90 B and D Squadrons carried out operations in Western IraqBritish Special Forces – Gulf War 2 and Southern Iraq; towards the end of the invasion, they escorted MI6 officers into Baghdad from Baghdad International Airport so they could carry out their missions, both Squadrons were replaced by G Squadron in early May. The US military designated the SAS element in Iraq during the invasion as Task Force 14;Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 , pp. 8–9, 12,13 in the months following the invasion, the SAS moved from Baghdad International Airport to MSS Fernandez in Baghdad, setting up and linking its \\"property\\" next to Delta Force, in summer 2003, following a request for a new mission, the SAS began Operation Paradoxical: The broadly drawn operation was for the SAS to hunt down threats to the coalition, SAS were 'joined at the hip' with Delta Force and JSOC, it also gave them greater latitude to work with US \\"classified\\" forces – prosecuting the best available intelligence. However, in winter 2003, they were placed under the command of the Chief of Joint Operations in Northwood, due to scepticism of Whitehall members about the UK mission in Iraq – making it more difficult for the SAS to work with JSOC.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 , pp. 16, 20–21, 39–40 By 2004, The various 22nd SAS regiment squadrons would be part of Task Fore Black to fight against the Iraqi Insurgency, General Stanley McChrystal, the commander of NATO forces in Iraq, has commented on A Squadron 22 SAS Regiment when part of Task Force Black/Knight (subcomponents of Task Force 145), carried out 175 combat missions during a six-month tour of duty. In January 2004, Major James Stenner and Sergeant Norman Patterson were killed when their vehicle hit a concrete roadblock whilst driving through the Green Zone at night; the SAS's targets during this period (before it was integrated into JSOC in late 2005 to early 2006) were former Ba'athist party regime elements. By early 2005, the SAS supplemented their land rover and Snatch vehicles with M1114 Humvee's for better protection; in southern Iraq, the SAS maintained a detachment in called Operation Hathor: consisting of a handful of soldiers based with British forces in Basra. Their primary role was to protect SIS (MI6) officers and to conduct surveillance and reconnaissance for the British Battle Group. In June 2005, after Delta Force took a number of casualties during Operation Snake Eyes, McChrystal asked the UK's DSF whether UK Special Forces would be able to assist, but he declined, citing ongoing British concerns about JSOCs detention facilities and other operational issues such as rules of engagement. This caused conflict between the DSF and the then-new commander of 22 SAS, Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams, who believed the SAS were wasting their time targeting Ba'athist regime elements and advocated for a closer relationship with JSOC, tensions between them escalated throughout the summer of 2005. Williams met with McChrystal, whom he had a good relationship with, to discuss how he could get the SAS to work more closely with Delta Force and JSOC; McChrystal met with the DSF and explained to him what JSOC was trying to do in Iraq, but the DSF questioned the tactics and in summary, strained relations further. The DSF tried to have Williams transferred, he took the case to General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, citing a long list of grievances, but his request did not command widespread support; at the end of 2005, the DSF was replaced. Many of issues preventing the SAS and TF (Task Force) Black's integration with JSOC had been resolved by the end of 2005 and TF Black began working more closely with JSOC. By late 2005, British commanders decided that the SAS would do six- month tours of duty, instead of the previous 4-month tours, it was officially confirmed in March 2006. Due to the Basra prison incident, in which the name of the UKSF forces in Iraq 'Task force Black' was leaked to the press, the force was renamed 'Task force Knight'; also in 2005, the regiment began using specially trained dogs, specifically during raids on houses in Baghdad.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 , pp.49, 71–72, 86–87, 91–93, 115–116, 200, 262Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.211 In mid-January 2006, Operation Paradoxical was replaced by Operation Traction: the SAS update/integration into JSOC, they deployed TGHG (Task Group Headquarters Group): this included senior officers and other senior members of 22 SAS – to JSOCs base at Balad. This was the first deployment of TGHG to Iraq since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the upgrade now meant that the SAS were \\"joined at the hip\\" with JSOC and it gave the SAS a pivatol role against Sunni militant groups, particularly AQIUrban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 , pp.117–118 In March 2006, members of B squadron SAS were involved in the release of peace activists Norman Kember, James Loney and Harmeet Singh Sooden. The three men had been held hostage in Iraq for 118 days during the Christian Peacemaker hostage crisis. in April 2006 B squadron, launched Operation Larchwood 4 which was an intelligence coup which led to the death of AQI's leader Abu Musab al- Zarqawi. In November 2006, Sergeant Jon Hollingsworth was killed in Basra whilst assaulting a house containing a senior al-Qaeda member; he was decorated for his service in this unit.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 , pp.199, 200–202, On 20 March 2007 G squadron raided a house in Basra and captured Qais Khazali; a senior Shia militant and an Iranian proxy, his brother and Ali Mussa Daqduq, without casualties. The raid turned out to be most significant raid conducted by British forces in Iraq, gaining valuable intelligence on Iranian involvement in the Shia insurgency. During the Spring and summer of 2007, the SAS suffered several men seriously wounded as it extended its operations into Sadr City.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 , pp. 222–227, 232 From 2007 to early 2008, A squadron achieved \\"extraordinary\\" success impact in destroying al-Qaeda's VIBED network in Iraq, ultimately saving lives.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 p. 244 In early 2008, B squadron carried out the regiments first HAHO parachute assault in Iraq.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 pp.138–146, pp. 259–260 In May 2008, the SAS replaced their Humvee's for new Bushmaster armoured vehicles. On 30 May 2009, Operation Crichton; the UKSF deployment to Iraq ended,Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 p.270 over the course of the war, 6 SAS soldiers were killed and a further 30 injured. =Somalia and Yemen= In 2009, members of the SAS and the Special Reconnaissance Regiment were deployed to Djibouti as part of Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa to carry out operations against Islamist terrorists in Yemen and Somalia amid concerns that the countries were becoming alternative bases for the extremists. In Yemen; they operate as part of a counter-terrorism training unit and assisting in missions to kill or capture AQAP leaders, in particular; they were hunting down for the terrorists behind the Cargo planes bomb plot. The SAS was carrying out surveillance missions of British citizens believed to be travelling to Yemen and Somalia for terrorist training and they are also working with US counterparts observing and \\"targeting\\" local terror suspects. Also in Yemen, the SAS was also liaising with local commandos and provided protection to embassy personnel. Members of the British SAS and US Army Special Forces trained members of the Yemeni Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU). Following the collapse of the Hadi regime in 2015, all coalition special operations personnel were officially withdrawn.p.351-352 =International military intervention against ISIL= In August 2014, the SAS were reported to be part of Operation Shader – the British participation in the ongoing military intervention against ISIL. They were reported to be on the ground gathering intelligence and helping with the evacuation of Yazidi refugees from the Sinjar mountains. Also they have reportedly been helping Kurdish forces in northern Iraq as well as carrying out operations in Syria. In particular on 15 May, the SAS confirmed the presence in al-Amr of a senior leader, Abu Sayyaf, who was then killed in an assault by US Special Forces. In October 2016, the Guardian reported that the SAS along with the Australian SASR are active in northern Iraq with US forces, where they have been calling in airstrikes in support of both Kurdish and Iraqi advances against ISIL. In November 2016, the Independent reported that the SAS and other British special forces, as part of a multinational special forces operation, were given a list of 200 British jihadist to kill or capture before they attempt to return to the UK. The 200 jihadist are senior members of ISIL that pose a direct threat to the UK, the list of British men and women has been compiled from intelligence supplied by MI5, MI6 and GCHQ; Sources said SAS soldiers have been told that the mission could be the most important in the regiment's 75-year history. SAS snipers targeted ISIL insurgents, employing sniper rifles such as the IWI DAN .338SAS Snipers to get world best rifle, Daily Star, August 2014 and Barrett M82A1 .50 BMG. =Libya (2014–present)= Since the beginning of 2016, the SAS was deployed to Libya during Libyan Civil War (2014–present), along with other UK Special forces, they have been escorting teams of MI6 agents to meet with Libyan officials and organise the supplying weapons and training to the Libyan army and to militias fighting against ISIL. Libya (2011) In March 2011, a joint SAS-MI6 team (E SquadronNeville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.296) were captured and detained by Libyan rebels, during the 2011 Libyan civil war. The team were stripped of their weapons. They were moved between at least two locations near Benghazi. They were later released.SAS rounded up and booted out as Libyan mission turns to farce https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/07/sas-mi6-released-libya- rebels The BBC reported that a troop of 20 soldiers of D Squadron 22 SAS deployed to Eastern Libya, where they operated in small groups in places like Misrata and Brega they assisted in training, coordinating and commanding opposition groups on and off the front line, and they were very active directing NATO airstrikes.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.297 Notes ;Footnotes ;Citations ;Bibliography          Category:Special Air Service Category:History of the British Army ","title":"History of the Special Air Service"},{"id":"9504298","text":"Manuel Maria Coelho.

Manufactured by Intamin, the ride opened on June 5, 2007 as the fastest roller coaster in Europe at 83.9 mph, which the ride reaches in 3 seconds, although this record has since been surpassed by Red Force at neighboring Ferrari Land. Since opening, the ride has experienced some technical problems, and as a result has had to shut down for varying periods of time during opening hours. Description Furius Baco has the shortest height of any Intamin Accelerator Coaster, at 46 feet tall. Furius Baco is 850 meters long, lasts 55 seconds and cost 15 million euros to build. It features several large turns, with a long inline twist, and a finale turn over the lake. The ride also features a different seating arrangement to other Intamin Accelerator coasters, where the seats are attached to the side of the barrel themed trains. This gives the riders the ultimate floorless feeling, with no track beneath or above them. This arrangement has now been commonly dubbed as 'wing rider' trains. Each of the three trains have 6 cars, with two riders seated on each side of the track, allowing each train to hold 24 passengers. The seating style, being off the track rather than above or below, differs from many roller coasters and thus the outside seats can be somewhat rough. Ride experience Once all the riders have been loaded onto the barrel themed side cars the train will slowly advance out of the station area and into the pre-show area; a laboratory style area with many whirling cogs and running machinery. The sound of a bike bell goes off which cues the entrance of the professors assistant, a monkey which cycles over the left hand side of the lab on a skybike. A video is shown, revealing a machine which is supposed to collect grapes for wine, and the professor is seen climbing down a ladder and removes a large spanner out of his lab coat. At this point the monkey appears to the left, holding a lever whilst the professor adds the finishing touches to his machine. The professor then notices the monkey, and shouts \\"No, No!\\" However, it is too late and the monkey pulls the lever, sending the professor flying into the cog machine; he is thrown around the laboratory, trapped in the cogs of the machine. At this point, the machine explodes, flooding the screen with wine. The cars then move forwards then back again, and on the screen the professor dives through the wine and then the ride launches without warning up a small hill before navigating a series of tight turns through the vineyard and through some tunnels. The ride then dives into an inline twist before dropping and twisting through a turn very close to the lake before rising up and going into the brake run where the monkey is hanging on the ceiling holding some grapes. Then the riders are let off the ride and into the shop where they can purchase an onride photo or a video of their ride.

In this year tens of thousands of Iraq young men, women and children were sentenced to death under the accusation of joining a political party. Those who were lucky - after unimaginable torture and interrogation - would be sentenced to Lifetime imprisonment. *The 1983 attack against Kurdish citizens belonging to the Barzani tribe, 8,000 of whom were rounded up by the regime in northern Iraq and executed in deserts at great distances from their homes. *The 1988 Anfal campaign, during which as many as 182,000 Iraqi Kurds disappeared. Most of the men were separated from their families and were executed in deserts in the west and south-west of Iraq. The remains of some of their wives and children have also been found in mass graves. *Chemical attacks against Kurdish villages from 1986 to 1988, including the Halabja attack, when the Iraqi Air Force dropped sarin, VX and tabun chemical agents on the civilian population, killing 5,000 people immediately and causing long-term medical problems, related deaths, and birth defects among the progeny of thousands more. *The 1991 massacre of Iraqi Shia Muslims after the Shia uprising at the end of the Gulf war, in which tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians in regions such as Basra, Karbala, Najaf, Nasiriya, Amara and Al-Hillah were killed. Thousands of homes were demolished and vast areas of Iraq's marches were dried up causing devastating effect on the lives of people and the environment. *Then, in March 1999, thousands more were believed to have been arrested, imprisoned and in some cases executed after a second uprising broke out after the killing of a prominent Shiite cleric. * In May 2003, Amnesty International reported finding a grave containing 40 bodies at Abul Khasib in southern Iraq, which is almost exclusively Shia, thought to contain bodies from the 1991 Shia uprising. *A massacre of Kurds in 1991, which targeted civilians and soldiers who fought for autonomy in northern Iraq after the Gulf war, also resulted in mass graves.

Created by writer Richard E. Hughes and artist George Mandel, she first appeared in Thrilling Comics #2 (March 1940), published by Nedor Comics. The character was later revived by writer Alan Moore for America's Best Comics. Nedor Comics The Woman in Red is the secret identity of policewoman Peggy Allen. Frustrated by the limitations of her job, Peggy creates a secret identity. As the Woman in Red, she wears a red, floor-length coat, hood, and mask. Among her opponents are the Spirit Killer, and cultists of the African death god Voa. The Woman in Red made her debut in Thrilling Comics #2 (March 1940). Comics historian Trina Robbins has identified the Woman in Red as the first masked female crime fighter, preceding such better known characters as Wonder Woman, Phantom Lady, and Mary Marvel, with Fantomah, who debuted one month earlier, being one of the earliest female superheroines. While the Woman in Red never made a cover appearance, she continued to appear regularly in issues of Thrilling Comics. Her last Golden Age appearance was in issue #46 (February 1945). AC Comics In 1990, the Woman in Red was revived by AC Comics in issue #29 of Femforce. America's Best Comics Alan Moore revived the Woman in Red, along with many other Nedor Comics characters, for his Tom Strong series. In Tom Strong #11 (January 2001), the Woman in Red is revealed to be a member of SMASH, a superhero team that had been placed in suspended animation after an alien invasion from the moon in 1969. She is revived 30 years later thanks to the efforts of Tom Strong. SMASH disbands shortly thereafter. When SMASH reforms three years later, the Woman in Red rejoins the team. Moore also changed the Woman in Red's history for this revival. Sometime after World War II, the Woman in Red came into the possession of a mysterious ruby crystal. This crystal gives her the powers of flight and energy projection. Prolonged contact with the crystal eventually turns her skin a shade of crimson. At first embarrassed by her skin color, she begins wearing a leather costume that covers her from head to toe. She eventually comes to terms with her condition and adopts a costume resembling a one-piece bathing suit. Powers and abilities Originally, the Woman in Red had no superpowers but was a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and markswoman. When revived by ABC, after coming into possession of a ruby crystal, the Woman in Red acquires the ability to fly and project energy. Her body is turned into a shade of crimson after prolonged exposure with the crystal. Film The Woman in Red appears alongside other Golden Age superheroes in the 2010 independent film Avenging Force: The Scarab.

It was released for the Commodore 64 and Apple II in 1987. Gameplay The game focuses on both the material and economic challenges of building a permanent, fully functioning space station in geocentric orbit. The game was set in 1996, and the player is given various selected scenarios to fulfill, from mundane tasks such as setting up a simple space station to developing and supplying a specified amount of high-grade, zero G pharmaceuticals to being the first to contact alien life. The game also is a cutthroat strategy game in multiplayer, as players compete over finite resources and resource management. Reception Computer Gaming World in 1987 gave the game a mixed review. While the single-player portion was praised, the review felt the game had too high a learning curve to be really suitable for multiplayer. The user interface was particularly bothersome, described as \\"a textbook case of how not to design a window/menu/graphics interface.\\" The documentation was similarly described as poorly organized and cryptic. In 1992 and 1994 surveys of science fiction games the magazine gave the title two-plus stars of five, calling it \\"An interesting failure ... the logistics just are not that much fun\\". Compute! reviewed the game more favorably, stating that \\"EOS offers a level of challenge unusual in space-related software. To succeed at this game requires careful thought\\".

It is now part of Alstom, the name Linke-Hofmann-Busch became defunct in 2009 when it became ALSTOM Transport Germany GmbH. During World War I, it became one of many companies in Germany drawn into the aircraft industry even though they had no prior experience in aircraft design. Linke-Hofmann-Busch first entered the aircraft industry by repairing and constructing aircraft designed by other established companies under licence, such as the Roland C.IIa, Albatros B.IIa, C.III and C.X. In 1916 Linke- Hofmann-Busch was awarded a contract to design and build a four-engined heavy bomber under the Riesenflugzeug (\\"giant aircraft\\") designation. Two designs were built in prototype form, the R.I and the R.II; both designs were unconventional. The R.I was unsuccessful, but the Linke-Hofmann R.II flew well. However, the war ended before it could go into production. Post-war attempts to build R.II's as passenger and transport aircraft were prevented by the Allied Control Commission which was concerned about bombers being built illicitly, under the guise of airliners, and the possible resumption of the war. right Indian Railways' LHB coaches are based on a design developed by Linke-Hofmann-Busch.

Its remains have been discovered beneath Cowbridge in the Welsh county of Vale of Glamorgan, previously Glamorganshire.

The park is named after local Alderman Fletcher Moss, who donated the park to the city of Manchester in 1915.\\"History of the Park and Gardens\\", Friends of Fletcher Moss Park and Parsonalge Gardens. It is part botanical garden and part wildlife habitat, but also offers recreational facilities such as recently refurbished tennis courts, rugby and football pitches, and a family- run café, The Alpine Tea Rooms. The park hosts a free, weekly, timed parkrun every Saturday morning at 9 am. History The Croft, where the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was founded in 1889 The main part of the gardens is a walled rock garden that was laid out by the botanist Robert Wood Williamson on a south-facing slope. Williamson sold the gardens and rockery along with his house, called The Croft, to Alderman Fletcher Moss, in 1912. Fletcher Moss, born in July 1843, was a philanthropist who led many public works in Manchester; in 1915 he persuaded the philanthropist Andrew Carnegie to fund the construction of a public library in Didsbury. He lived in the Old Parsonage by St James's Church, Stenner Lane, having taken over residence from the vicar, a Rev. W. J. Kidd, who left the property complaining it was haunted. In 1919 he gave the gardens to the people of Manchester, declaring he had \\"determined to offer all that part of my property extending from the Fletcher Moss Playing Fields to Stenner Lane, to the corporation if I could retain the use of it for my life\\". Robert Williamson's old house, the Croft, was the location of the first meeting of the organisation later to become known as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). In 1889, Emily Williamson née Bateson (Robert's wife) formed a group called the \\"Plumage League\\" to protest against the breeding of birds for plumage to be used in women's hats, a highly fashionable practice at the time. The group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with \\"The Fur, Fin and Feather Folk\\" in Croydon, and formed the RSPB. Layout Giant gunnera leaves by the pond Row running through Fletcher Moss eventually turns into a path by the River Mersey The main rock gardens are laid out on a south-facing slope and are sheltered from the elements, allowing a great number of non-hardy species to thrive in a micro-climate. Small waterfalls run down the rock gardens into a pond which is surrounded by royal ferns, marsh marigolds, skunk cabbage, Gunnera (\\"giant rhubarb\\") and irises. The gardens contain wide range of ornamental trees and shrubs, including Chusan palms, tulip trees, mulberry, dawn redwood, swamp cypress, Chinese dogwood, Adam's laburnum, common walnut, Oxydendrum arboreum, and various dwarf conifers. To the west of the rock gardens, the gardens of the Old Parsonage lie on the other side of Stenner Lane. The entrance to the garden is marked by a striking neo-Norman stone arched gate which is topped with a sculpture of an eagle; this was originally a feature on the Spread Eagle Hotel on Corporation Street, Manchester, of which Fletcher Moss was proprietor. When the hotel was demolished in 1902, Moss took the eagle effigy and mounted it on his gate. The Parsonage gardens contain several large yew and cedar of Lebanon trees; beneath one of the yew trees are the graves of several of Alderman Moss's beloved dogs and – reputedly – also the grave of his favourite horse. The Old Parsonage house was open to the public during the 1970s as an art gallery devoted to Manchester art, and the orchid houses were also a visitor attraction; both were closed during the 1980s but after a spirited local campaign the Parsonage opened up in 2012 as a community centre and gallery where there is now a vibrant programme of classes, events and exhibitions and the building is much loved by the community, and well used. The orchid house originally housed a collection of orchids donated by Major Raffles, a resident of Didsbury, but when the heating system broke down there was no funding to replace it and so these plants were moved to Wythenshawe Park. The building which housed the orchids is now an Alpine House – fittingly since there used to be Alpines in the gardens. The gardens are now maintained and cultivated by the Friends of Fletcher Moss Park and Parsonage Gardens, a group of local volunteers. To the south and west there are water meadows, partially flooded woodland (Stenner Woods) in a former oxbow of the River Mersey and Millgate Fields, a slightly elevated area of fields and woodland in a loop of the river Mersey, surrounding two fields used to graze livestock. This is one of the venues for parkrun UK. Awards Fletcher Moss has held the Green Flag Award, the national standard for parks and green spaces in England, since 2000. Location Fletcher Moss Gardens are located close to the River Mersey and Stenner Woods, at the southern end of Wilmslow Road where the road curves sharply east at the Old Cock Inn, near Parrs Wood. The Gardens can be easily reached by public transport as it lies on the Wilmslow Road bus corridor and is close to East Didsbury railway station.

It means \\"soup to chase a hangover\\" and is also called sulguk (). It usually consists of dried Napa cabbage, vegetables and meat in a hearty beef broth. One type of haejangguk, Seonjiguk, includes sliced congealed ox blood (similar to black pudding) and another type, Sundaeguk includes a kind of blood sausage made with intestine stuffed with pig's blood and other ingredients. History In the Nogeoldae, a manual for learning spoken Chinese published in the late Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392), the term seongjutang () appears. It means \\"soup to get sober\\" and is assumed to be the origin of haejangguk. According to the record, the soup consists of thinly sliced meat, noodles, scallions, and powder of 'cheoncho' () in a broth. The composition is same as the basic recipe of a present-day haejangguk. Although haejangguk is not mentioned in cookbooks written during the Joseon (1392–1910), relevant contents can be seen in genre paintings and documents of the late Joseon. In Shin Yun-bok (b. 1758)'s painting titled Jumakdo ( \\"Painting of the Tavern\\"), a scene regarding haejangguk is well depicted. A group of unemployed children of the rich gather to eat haejangguk while a jumo (a female owner of a jumak) ladles boiling soup out of a cauldron. This dish seemed to be eaten not only by commoners. According to Haedong jukji (海東竹枝), poetry collection written by Choe Yeong-nyeon (崔永年 1856∼1935http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?i=277486),해동죽지 海東竹枝 haejangguk is referred to as hyojonggaeng (), which literally means a \\"dawn bell soup\\". The book states that the area within Namhansanseong is known for making the soup well. The ingredients for the soup are inner parts of Napa cabbage, and kongnamul (soybean sprouts), mushrooms, galbi, sea cucumber, and abalone. They are mixed together with tojang (fermented bean paste) and are simmered thoroughly for a day. The cooked soup is then put into a hangari or earthen crock covered with a pad of cotton and sent to Seoul at night. When the dawn bell rings the time, the soup is delivered to a house of high-ranking officials.재상 宰相 Nate / EncyKorea The hangari is still warm and the soup is very good for relieving hangovers. The record suggests that hyojonggaeng is either the first delivery food to cure a hangover after a banquet held by jaesang was ended or was used as a bribe. Types White haejangguk (a.k.a. Seolleongtang) There are various types of haejangguk according to region based on ingredients and recipe that give each variety its own characteristic taste. Haejangguk of the Seoul region is a kind of tojangguk (soybean paste soup) made with kongnamul, radish, napa cabbage, scallions, coagulated ox blood, and tojang in a broth. The broth is prepared by simmering ox bones in a pot with water for hours. The neighborhood of Cheongjin-dong is famous for the Seoul style haejangguk. In the city of Jeonju, people eat \\"kongnamaul gukbap\\" as a haejangguk. A little lean kongnamul with the length of an index finger are poached in water diluted with a small amount of salt. Along with the kongnamul, steamed rice, sliced ripe kimchi, scallions and garlic, beef broth, and a small amount of shank are put into a ttukbaegi (a small earthen pot) over heat and the kongnamul broth is poured into it. When the ingredients are boiled, a raw egg is cracked over the soup. Once it is served, a mixture of sesame seeds and salt, scallions, minced garlic, chili pepper, and chili pepper powder, and saeujeot (salted fermented shrimp) are put into the haejanguk are added according to the diner's taste. It is said that, when eating haejangguk, if the diner drinks a cup of moju (母酒) made by boiling a fermented mixture of makgeolli (a type of rice wine), sugar, and wheat flour, the combination would be good to alleviate the hangover.모주 母酒 Nate / EncyKorea There are also haejangguk with cold soup. On the shore of the East Sea, especially in Uljin County, \\"ojingeo mulhoe guksu\\" (오징어물회국수) is eaten as a haejangguk.

The pueo is one of the more famous of the various physical forms assumed by aumākua (ancestor spirits) in Hawaiian culture. Pueo inhabit forests and grasslands throughout the islands of Hawaiʻi, although their numbers seem to be declining, particularly in the last two decades, and especially on the island of Oʻahu, upon which they were at one time numerous. Pueo is listed by the state of Hawaiʻi as an endangered species on the island of Oʻahu.  Taxonomy  This taxon was first named by Andrew Bloxam (as the species Strix sandwichensis). He saw it, although did not collect a specimen, while in the Hawaiian Islands in 1825 as the naturalist on board HMS Blonde. It is now considered to be a subspecies of the short-eared owl, Asio flammeus, although Storrs Olson does not consider it to be distinct from Asio flammeus flammeus.  Threats to survival  Pueo nest on the ground, which makes their eggs and young susceptible to predation by the introduced small Asian mongoose and other predators. Pueo are strongly affected by light pollution. They are often killed in vehicular accidents in which they dive toward the headlights of cars, possibly in an attempt to hunt. Many such collisions have been reported on Interstate H-3 and other newly built roadways in areas which once held high populations of pueo. Pueo appear to be somewhat resistant to the avian malaria that has devastated many other endemic bird populations in Hawaii; however, they have recently become victim to a mysterious \\"sick owl syndrome\\", or SOS, in which large numbers of pueo have been found walking dazedly on roads, leading to death by collision. The cause of sick owl syndrome is unknown; it is suspected that pesticide toxicity may be responsible, particularly through secondary rodenticide poisoning. However, it has also been hypothesized that the cause may be an infectious agent, seizure- like confusion due to light pollution, or a variety of other causes.

Most of these games are either independently run or used as a viral marketing campaign by a company or brand.  Before 2001: Influences and precursors  Due to factors like \\"the curtain\\", attempts to begin games with \\"stealth launches\\" that fulfill the TINAG (This Is Not a Game) aesthetic, and the restrictive non-disclosure agreements governing how much information may be revealed by the puppet masters of promotional games, the design process for many ARGs is often shrouded in secrecy, making it difficult to discern the extent to which they have been influenced by other works. In addition, the cross-media nature of the form allows ARGs to incorporate elements of so many other art forms and works that attempting to identify them all would be a nearly impossible task far beyond the scope of this article. =Possible inspirations from fiction and other art forms= G. K. Chesterton's 1905 short story \\"The Tremendous Adventures of Major Brown\\" (part of a collection entitled The Club of Queer Trades) seems to predict the ARG concept, as does John Fowles's 1965 novel The Magus. Ludic texts such as the popular Choose Your Own Adventure children's novels may also have provided some inspiration. The plot of the British television drama serial The One Game, broadcast in 1988, was entirely based on the concept of the ARG (referred to as a \\"reality game\\" in the script). William Gibson's novel Pattern Recognition includes a recognizable example of a modern ARG, although it was published after the development of the genre began in earnest. Reader- influenced online fiction such as AOL's QuantumLink Serial provides a model that incorporates audience influence into the storytelling in a manner similar to that of ARGs, as do promotional online games like Wizards of the Coast's Webrunner games. Live action role-playing games (LARPs) are a major influence on the ARG concept, particularly those such as played by UCLA's Enigma group, the MIT Assassin's Guild, and Dead Earth Productions (a horror LARP company in the San Francisco Bay Area during the late 1980s to the mid-1990s), although most notably White Wolf's \\"Vampire: The Masquerade.\\" LARPs have often extended into the real world, where players can encounter actors and clues that further a real-time gaming plot. Other possible antecedents include performance art and other theatrical forms that attempt to break Brecht's \\"fourth wall\\" and directly engage the audience. =Early examples of major ARGs or proto-ARGs prior to 2001= 'Ong's Hat/Incunabula was most likely started sometime around 1993, and also included most of the aforementioned design principles. Ong's Hat also incorporated elements of legend tripping into its design, as chronicled in a scholarly work titled \\"Legend-Tripping Online: Supernatural Folklore and the Search for Ong's Hat\\".Legend-Tripping Online: Supernatural Folklore and the Search for Ong's Hat Some scholars disagree on the classification of the Ong's Hat story.ARG versus Legend Tripping In 1996, Wizards of the Coast launched a proto-alternate reality game called Webrunner: The Hidden Agenda to promote their game Netrunner. It cast players as hackers through seven puzzle-themed \\"gates\\" to get the secret data (\\"agenda\\"). The popular game was the first online game tied into a product release, making the front page of the New York Times technology section. A sequel, Webrunner II: The Forbidden Code, followed on to promote the release of the Proteus expansion of the game. Dreadnot was a (non-commercial) ARG produced with a grant from the San Francisco Chronicle and published on sfgate.com in 1996. It included most of the aforementioned design principles. The game included working voice mail phone numbers for characters, clues in the source code, character email addresses, off-site websites, real locations in San Francisco, real people (including then-Mayor Willie Brown), and of course a fictional mystery. In 1997, a year prior to the release of the Douglas Adams computer game Starship Titanic, The Digital Village launched a web site purporting to be that of an intergalactic travel agency called Starlight Travel, which in the game is the Starship Titanic's parent company. The site combined copious amounts of Monty Python-esque writing (by Michael Bywater) with ARG-type interactivity. When a site visitor filled out a personal information form, including email address and \\"favorite frog\\" (from a convenient – and long – drop-down list), approximately one week later, a spam email for something other than Starlight Travel would arrive, and would include a reference to the specific frog the visitor had selected. Another example involved a series of three emails; the first called the reader's attention to a password-protected intranet for the Starlight Lines company,http://www.starlightlines.com the second urged the reader to delete unread any future emails, as confidential information was being erroneously emailed, and the third revealed the confidential password for the restricted site: \\"1\\". The marketing for the 1999 movie The Blair Witch Project resembled ARGs in many ways (and some of its makers went on to create the 2005 Audi promotional ARG Art of the Heist), expanding the world of the movie online, adding backstory, and treating the fiction as reality through real-world media such as fliers and a fake documentary on the Sci-Fi Channel. However, perhaps in part due to the subject material and the absence of overt metacommunications that this was fiction, it also resembles an internet hoax or attempt to create an urban legend. Pervasive play games like the Go Game and the Nokia Game also incorporated many elements similar to ARGs (although they tended to lack the narrative element central to ARGs) and prefigured the public play components of large- scale corporate ARGs like I Love Bees, Art of the Heist and Last Call Poker. Electronic Arts' Majestic (video game) was developed at roughly the same time as the Beast, although it launched after the Beast had concluded. Featuring phone calls, emails and other media that involved players in a multiplatform narrative, the game was eventually cancelled due to lack of players. Factors ranging from the fee required to play to Majestic's unfortunate timing and subject matter in relation to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center to the absence of the TINAG principle ( e.g. in-game phone calls were preceded by an announcement that they were part of the game) have been cited to explain its failure.  The Beast and its influence  In 2001, in order to market the movie A.I.: Artificial Intelligence and a planned series of Microsoft computer games based on the film, Microsoft's Creative Director, Jordan Weisman, and another Microsoft game designer, Elan Lee, conceived of an elaborate murder mystery played out across hundreds of websites, email messages, faxes, fake ads, and voicemail messages. They hired Sean Stewart, an award-winning science-fiction/fantasy author, to write the story. The game, dubbed \\"the Citizen Kane of online entertainment\\" by Internet Life, was a runaway success that involved over three million active participants from all over the world during its run and would become the seminal example of the nascent ARG genre. An early asset list for the project contained 666 files, prompting the game's puppetmasters to dub it \\"the Beast\\", a name which was later adopted by players. A large and extremely active fan community called the Cloudmakers formed to analyze and participate in solving the game, and the combined intellect, tenacity and engagement of the group soon forced the puppetmasters to create new subplots, devise new puzzles, and alter elements of the design to keep ahead of the player base. Somewhat unusually for a computer-based game, the production engaged equal numbers of male and female participants, and drew players from a wide spectrum of age groups and backgrounds. =Influences on the development of the Beast= Due to the influence the Beast exerted over the form of later ARGs and the willingness of its creators to talk about its development, its sources of inspiration are both particularly relevant to the evolution of the modern ARG and somewhat more verifiable than other possible antecedents. Elan Lee, one of its creative principals, cites the 1997 movie The Game as an inspiration, as well as the Beatles' \\"Paul is dead\\" hoax. Sean Stewart, another of the three principal designers, notes that designing and running an ARG bears some similarities to running an RPG, and the influence of that particular game form is further suggested by the fact that Jordan Weisman, the game's third main designer, was also the founder of leading RPG company FASA. He also noted that the sort of \\"creative scavenging\\" behavior the Beast depended on has its antecedents outside the arts: the Beast just \\"accidentally reinvented science as pop culture entertainment.\\" =The player community= Although the Beast ran for only three months, it prompted the formation of a highly organized and intensely engaged community that remains active years after the game concluded. Perhaps more significantly, it inspired a number of its participants to create games adapting and expanding the model, extending it from an anomalous one-time occurrence to a new genre of entertainment and allowing the community to grow even after the Beast itself concluded. Members of the Cloudmakers group went on to form ARGN, the primary news source for the genre, and Unfiction, its central community hub, as well as designing the first successful and widely played indie ARGs, such as LockJaw and Metacortechs, and corporate efforts such as Perplex City.  2002–2003: Community and genre growth  The years immediately after the Beast saw independent developers who had played it extend the form from a one-time occurrence to a new genre of gaming, and the formation of an ever-growing community devoted to playing, designing and discussing ARGs. =Grassroots development= Under the influence of the Beast and enthusiastic about the power of collaboration, several Cloudmakers came together with the idea that they could create a similar game. The first effort to make an independent Beast-like game, Ravenwatchers, failed, but another team soon assembled and would meet with success. With very little experience behind them, the group managed, after nine months of development, to create a viable game that was soon seized upon eagerly by the Cloudmakers group and featured in WIRED Magazine. As players of the Beast, members of the Lockjaw development team were extremely aware of the community playing the game and took steps to encourage the tight bonding of the player base through highly collaborative puzzles, weekly Euchre games, and the inclusion of player personas in the game. While the numbers never rivaled those of The Beast, with absolutely no funding or promotion, the game proved both that it was possible for developers to create these games without corporate funding or promotion, and that there was interest in the ARG form beyond a one-time audience for a production on the Beast's scale. Lockjaw marked the start of the ARG as a genre of gaming, rather than simply a one-time occurrence. Shortly before Lockjaw's conclusion, players discovered a game that seemed to revolve around the movie Minority Report. Despite speculation to the contrary, the game (known as Exocog) was not an official promotion for the film, but an experiment in interactive storytelling by Jim Miller. Inspired by the independent Lockjaw effort, Dave Szulborski introduced ChangeAgents, a spinoff of EA's failed Majestic ARG, to the ARGN audience, then followed it with two additional installments. During this time, Szulborski also created a successful grassroots game not based on the Majestic universe, called Chasing the Wish. Just before the release of the third and the final Matrix movie, the team that developed Lockjaw launched Metacortechs, an ARG based on that universe. The fan fiction effort was very successful, reached a larger and more active player base than many professionally produced games, and was at first assumed by many to be an officially sanctioned promotion for the movie. Metacortechs was followed by an ever-increasing number of grassroots ARGs. In the wake of these successful, low-budget independent ARGs, an active \\"grassroots\\" development community began to evolve within the genre. While the quality of the grassroots games continues to vary wildly, amateur storytellers, web designers, and puzzle creators continue to provide independently developed ARGs for the active player community. =Community development= The term Alternate Reality Gaming was first used by Sean Stacey, one of the moderators of the Lockjaw player community, in the Trail for the game. Stacey and Steve Peters, another of the moderators, created the two websites that have become the central hub of the ARG community: ARGN and UnFiction. Due to their efforts, when Lockjaw ended, the players had a new community resource allowing them to assemble to play the games that were soon to follow. Unfiction now boasts over 13,000 members, and ARGN employs a staff of 15 volunteer writers to report on new games and other topics of interest to the community, and produces a weekly netcast.  2004–2006: Massive-scale commercial games and mainstream attention  After the success of the first major entries in the nascent ARG genre, a number of large corporations looked to ARGs to promote both their products, and to add their companies' images by demonstrating their interest in innovative and fan-friendly marketing methods. To create buzz for the launch of the Xbox game Halo 2, Microsoft hired the team that had created the Beast, now operating independently as 42 Entertainment. The result, I Love Bees, departed radically from the website-hunting and puzzle-solving that had been the focus of the Beast. I Love Bees wove together an interactive narrative set in 2004, and a War Of The Worlds-style radio drama set in the future, the latter of which was broken into 30- to 60-second segments and broadcast over ringing payphones worldwide. The game pushed players outdoors to answer phones, create and submit content, and recruit others, and received as much or more mainstream notice than its predecessor, finding its way onto television during a presidential debate, and becoming one of the New York Times' catchphrases of 2004. A slew of imitators, fan tributes and parodies followed. The following spring, Audi launched The Art of the Heist to promote its new A3. Roughly a year after I Love Bees, 42 Entertainment produced Last Call Poker, a promotion for Activision's video game Gun. Designed to help modern audiences connect with the Western genre, Last Call Poker centered around a working poker site, held games of \\"Tombstone Hold 'Em\\" in cemeteries around the United States—as well as in at least one digital venue, World of Warcraft's own virtual reality cemetery—and sent players to their own local cemeteries to clean up neglected grave sites and perform other tasks. At the end of 2005, the International Game Developers Association ARG Special Interest Group was formed \\"to bring together those already designing, building, and running ARGs, in order to share knowledge, experience, and ideas for the future.\\"  2005–2006: The rise of the self-supporting ARG  As the genre has grown, there has been increasing interest in exploring models that provide funding for large-scale ARGs that are neither promotions for other products or limited by the generally small budget of grassroots/indie games. The two major trends that have emerged in this area are support through the sale of products related to the game, and fees for participation in the game. A third possible model is one using in-game advertising for other products, as in The LOST Experience, but at this time no large-scale game has attempted to fund itself solely through in-game advertising. The first major attempt (other than EA's failed Majestic) to create a self-supporting ARG was Perplex City, which launched in 2005 after a year's worth of teasers. The ARG offered a $200,000 prize to the first player to locate the buried Receda Cube and was funded by the sale of puzzle cards. The first season of the game ended in January 2007, when Andy Darley found the Receda Cube at Wakerly Great Wood in Northamptonshire, UK. Mind Candy, the production company, has also produced a board game related to the ARG and plans to continue it with a second season beginning March 1, 2007. Whether the model was a success is unknown at this time, although Mind Candy's acceptance of corporate sponsorship and venture capital suggests that the puzzle cards alone are not enough to fully fund the ARG at this time. In March 2006, Elan Lee and Dawne Weisman founded edoc laundry, a company designed to produce ARGs using clothes as the primary platform. Consumers decipher the codes hidden within the garments and input the results into the game's main website to reveal pieces of a story about the murder of a band manager. Reviving the pay-to-play model, Studio Cypher launched the first chapter of its \\"multiplayer novel\\" in May 2006. Each \\"chapter\\" is a mini-ARG for which participants who pay the $10 registration fee receive earlier access to information and greater opportunities to interact with characters than non-paying participants. VirtuQuest, a well- known corporate team, also attempted a pay-to-play model with Township Heights later in the year, but despite initial enthusiasm on the part of the ARG community, the game was not well-received due to the design team's use of player Hybrid-Names based on their real life names. Also the short run time frame was not appreciated by some seasoned players. In June 2006, Catching the Wish launched from an in-game website about comic books based on its predecessor, 2003's Chasing the Wish. 42 Entertainment released Cathy's Book, by Sean Stewart and Jordan Weisman, in October 2006, shifting the central medium of this ARG from the internet to the printed page. The young-adult novel contains an \\"evidence packet\\" and expands its universe through websites and working phone numbers, but is also a stand-alone novel that essentially functions as an individually playable ARG. Neither the cost of creating the book nor sales figures are available (although it made both American and British bestseller lists) to determine whether the project was successfully self-funded. It is difficult to judge the efficacy of self-funded ARG models at this time, but it seems likely that exploration of ways to fund large-scale ARGs without using them as marketing for other products will continue as the genre grows.  2006 onward: New developments  2006 produced less large- scale corporate ARGs than past years, but the ARG form continued to spread and be adapted for promotional uses, as an increasing number of TV shows and movies extended their universes onto the internet through such means as character blogs and ARG-like puzzle trails, and as an increasing number of independent/grassroots games launched, with varying levels of success. lonelygirl15, a popular series of videos on YouTube, relinquished an unprecedented amount of control to its audience by recognizing a fan-created game as the \\"official\\" ARG. 2007 got off to a strong start immediately, with Microsoft's Vanishing Point to promote the launch of Windows Vista. The game was designed by 42 Entertainment and, due in part to many large-scale real world events, such as a lavish show at the Bellagio Fountain in Las Vegas as well as a prizes of a trip into space and having a winner's name engraved on all AMD Athlon 64 FX chips for a certain period of time, received large media attention. It was followed almost immediately by a promotion, also rumored to be a 42 Entertainment production, for the release of the Nine Inch Nails album Year Zero, in which fans discovered leaked songs on thumb drives in washrooms at concerts. Monster Hunter Club, a promotion for the U.S. release of the movie The Host, launched by sending action figures and other items to prominent members of the ARG community. Perplex City concluded its first season by awarding a $200,000 prize to a player who found the game's missing cube. =Television tie-ins and \\"extended experiences\\"= Even before the development of the ARG genre, television sought to extend the reality of its shows onto the web with websites that treated the world as real, rather than discussing it as fiction. An early example was Fox's Freakylinks, developed by Haxan, creators of the Blair Witch Project, who would later go on to develop the well-known ARGs The Art of the Heist and Who Is Benjamin Stove. Freakylinks employed a website designed to look like it had been created by amateur paranormal enthusiasts to generate internet interest in the show, which gathered a cult following but was canceled after 13 episodes. In September 2002, following a successful initial foray into ARG-like territory with 2001's Alias web game, ABC brought alternate reality gaming more definitively to the television screen with the show Push, Nevada. Produced by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, the show created a fictional city in Nevada, named Push. When advertising the show, they advertised the city instead, with billboards, news reports, company sponsors, and other realistic life-intruding forms. During each episode of the show, highly cryptic clues would be revealed on screen, while other hidden clues could be found on the city's website. Unfortunately, the show was cancelled mid-season, and all of the remaining clues were released to the public. Clever watchers eventually figured out that the show would still be paying out its $1 million prize during Monday Night Football. The last clue was revealed during half-time, prompting those fortunate enough to have solved the puzzle to call a telephone number. The first person to call received $1 million. In October 2004, the ReGenesis Extended Reality game launched in tandem with the Canadian television series ReGenesis. Clues and stories from the series sent players online to stop a bioterrorist attack. In 2006, the TV tie-in ARG began to come into its own when there was a surge of ARGs that extended the worlds of related television shows onto the internet and into the real world. As with Push, Nevada, ABC led the way, launching three TV tie-in ARGs in 2006: Kyle XY, Ocular Effect (for the show Fallen) and The LOST Experience (for the show LOST). ABC joined with Channel 4 in the UK and Australia's Channel 7 in promoting a revamped web site for The Hanso Foundation. The site was focused on a fictitious company prevalent in the storyline of the TV series, and the game was promoted through television advertisements run during LOST episodes. Ocular Effect was launched in collaboration with Xenophile Media and Double Twenty Productions. NBC followed suit in January 2007, beginning an ARG for its hit TV series Heroes launched through an in-game reference to the website for Primatech Paper, a company from the show, which turned out to be real. Text messages and emails led players who applied for \\"employment\\" at the site to secret files on the show's characters.

Born in The Liberties, Dublin, he was best known for his tin whistle playing and his long history with The Chieftains (from 1962 to 1979). With The Chieftains Potts was a founding member of The Chieftains. He was great friends with fellow band member and whistle player Paddy Moloney, and they often went around Dublin playing in sessions and gigging during the 1950s. In November 1962, Potts helped form The Chieftains. He briefly left the group in 1968 for a contract with Gael-Linn Records but returned to play for the band soon after. He was primarily a whistle player, although he also played the bodhrán and bones. He played with the band until 1979, when the pressures of the music scene (and touring) prompted him to leave the band for an easier life. Other bands Before The Chieftains, Potts was an original member of Seán Ó Riada's group \\"Ceoltoirí Chualann\\". After The Chieftains, Potts did a lot of radio work for RTÉ and founded Bakerswell, with whom he undertook several fund-raising tours for NPU in the United States. In 1972, while still with The Chieftains, Potts and Paddy Moloney, along with Peadar Mercier (another Chieftains member) recorded an album called Tin Whistles where both Potts and Moloney played tin whistle tunes accompanied by a bodhrán. Potts also played the bodhrán and bones, and attempted to learn the uilleann pipes but admitted he never felt quite comfortable with the instrument and, after a few years at the pipes, he gave up and went back to the whistle. Later life After Potts retired from the traditional scene, he could still be found playing at traditional festivals around the country and occasionally abroad. He served as Chairman and Honorary President of Na Píobairí Uilleann in Dublin. He died at age 83 on 11 February 2014.Irish Times death notice.Irish Independent obituary; accessed 12 February 2014. Personal life Seán and his wife Bernadette (who wed in 1960) had four children. Potts' family was filled with musicians. From his grandfather, John Potts, an accomplished uillean piper and native of Kiltra, County Wexford, to his uncles Tommy Potts, a fiddler, and Eddie Potts, a piper, fiddler and saxophonist. His aunt Teresa was an accordionist and pianist in the 1950s. Another aunt, originally named Mary, who became Sister Kevin of the Presentation Sisters, taught music at a convent school in Dingle, County Kerry.

It is a spin-off of Episode 2 of Walking with Dinosaurs (\\"Time of the Titans\\") and the special The Ballad of Big Al. The main point of the game is to find all the animals and plants, including several location features, that are distributed in five different zones. The game is available on the BBC website as an alpha, as it was never finished. Gameplay The player begins the game in the Mossy Plain, the first location in the game. The player then must find everything on the checklist in the Electronic Field Guide (also containing controls, instructions and a world map) in order to unlock a hidden level: the Salt Lake, where the player can create their own dinosaur herds to explore their behavior. The game contains six regions, the Mossy Plain (inhabited by three Diplodocus), the Forest (later inhabited by a female Allosaurus, although the cry of an unseen Ornitholestes can be heard), the Crater (not inhabited by any dinosaurs), the Dry Riverbed (inhabited by one and later two Allosaurus; a Diplodocus carcass can also be found here), the Desert (inhabited by three Diplodocus, one of which is usually killed, two Allosaurus, one trapped in quicksand, and another who is apparently Big Al from 'The Ballad of Big Al', and who dies of his injuries later in the game after tripping over a fallen tree-trunk while trying to hunt down a Dryosaurus in the dry season. Later, you will see two pterosaurs, and two Stegosaurus, one of which is dead and trapped in quicksand) and the Salt Lake (the largest region, where the player can create any number of small/large Diplodocus and Allosaurus at their will). The Salt Lake is accessible in two ways, either once the player has found everything in the game, causing a rockfall to occur in the Desert. The player then must climb up the rocks and onto the cliff, where they must tag onto one of the two pterosaurs inhabiting the Desert, which will fly the player to the Salt Lake, or when of the Diplodocus go to that area and the player tags along with it, than rotates the camera towards a little depression in the hill next to it then drops him/herself and walks over the hill until the salt lake. The second way is probably a glitch or a mistake that the developers never noticed or ignored.

They are also found in the province of Sindh in Pakistan, particularly the city of Karachi.People of India: Uttar Pradesh, Volume XLII, edited by A. Hasan & J. C. Das, p. 1301. History and origin The town of Kakori in Lucknow district is home to a number of Alavi, Manihar and Abbasi families, and word Kakorvi Shaikh literally means the Shaikhs of the town of Kakori. The term Shaikh (Arabic: , shaykh; pl. shuyūkh), is a word or honorific term in the Arabic language that literally means \\"elder.\\" It is commonly used to designate an elder of a tribe, a revered wise man, or an Islamic scholar. In India, the Shaikh title is used by the descendants of Arab and other Muslim immigrants who settled in South Asia, and signifies Arab descent. From the beginning of Muslim rule in South Asia in 713 AD, technocrats, bureaucrats, soldiers, traders, scientists, architects, teachers, theologians and Sufis flocked from the rest of the Muslim world, to the Islamic Sultanate in South Asia and settled permanently. The descendants of these Arabs usually use the title of Shaikh. These Shaikh family often claim descent from the early Caliphs of Islam. The of Kakorvi Shaikh are sometimes referred to as Moulvizadigan (Moulvis) and Makhdoomzadigan (Makhdooms), Alavis indicating that they are descendants of Mullah Abu Bakr Jami Alavi, who settled in Kakori in 1461 and/or descendants of Qari Amir Saifuddin Alavi, who settled in Kakori in 1512.They belong by and large to the Alavi and Abbasi families, who settled in the Awadh region from the 12th.Century onwards. According to a classical Urdu work, the Nafhatun Nasim, which is a record of scions of a 16th-century sage Mullah Abdul Karim Alavi and which was later published by Amir Ahmed Alavi in 1934, and is an historic account of the settlement of these Alavi Shaikhs in the town of Kakori. The name Alavi () signifies ancestry from Ali ibn Abi Talib (), the fourth Caliph of Sunni Islam and the first Imam in Shia Islam. Ali was the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad. In addition, the other major group Shaikh settled in Kakori are the Abbasis. The name denotes descent from Abbas ibn Abd-al-Muttalib, the paternal uncle of Muhammad. The Abbasid caliphate was established by the Abbasi clan and ruled the Middle East during 750–1258AD (510 years). The Hashmities are mainly in Karachi. Genealogies The Abbasiyan-i- Kakori, is the family tree of Kakorian Abbasi families by Muhammad Hasan Abbasi which was published in 1945. In its present form, Hashimites of Kakori contains genealogical records of an intricate familial hierarchy that evolved predominantly from three houses, the Moulvis, Makhdooms [cf Alavi] and Qazis [cf Abbasi]. The patriarchs of all three houses were émigrés hailing from the Banu Hashim clan [cf Hashemites] of the Quraysh tribe of Hejaz (in present-day Saudi Arabia) [cf Banu Quraysh], who settled in Kakori since the early advent of Islam in the region, back in the 15th century. Their ensuing generations, being passionate in their resolve to protect their Arab heritage, have fostered matrimonial alliances preferentially with the people of authentic Arab descent to embrace allies into their folds, thereby, cultivating a very tradition- bound society with its home in Kakori until the diaspora following the foundation of Pakistan in 1947. Today, Kakorian Hashimites are spread far and wide across Australia, Canada, Europe, India, Middle East, Pakistan, UK, and USA. The website Hashimites of Kakori, compiled and hosted by Dr. Misbahuddin Zafar Alavi of Canada since 2006, is one of the largest listing of Alavi and Abbasi families comprising over 10,000 interlinked records spanning almost 1600 years showing in some cases 50 generations of Alavi and 60 generations of Abbasi families. Manihar The word Manihar is derived from Man, meaning heart in english, and the agentive sufix har. Their traditional landowners and martial race, and some time selling Glass bangles and makers of Gunpowder they are also known as Atishbaz, Maniharzada and shekh siddiqui, this word being derived from they claims descent from the first Caliph of Islam, Abu Bakr, and as such are sub-group of the shekh Siddiqui community.[citation needed] Their main clans are the Bachchal, Bhadauriya, bhale sultan, Chandel, Milki, mian, Kachchoiyana, Rana, Khalri, Talwar, Turk, Uzbek, Parmaar, Rohilla, Rananjay and Raikwar.

The phrase \\"One Thousand Children\\" only refers to those children who came unaccompanied and left their parents behind back in Europe. In nearly all cases, their parents were not able to escape with their children, because they could not get the necessary visas among other reasons. Later, nearly all these parents were murdered by the Nazis.

Originally only about one thousand such children had been identified as OTC children — hence the name \\"The One Thousand Children\\". By 2017 about 1,400 have been identified. The One Thousand Children, Inc. (OTC, Inc.) was an organization created for further welfare of the OTC children.  Definition and early history  Some 1.5 million children, nearly all of them Jewish, were deliberately murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. (This includes those who died of starvation, or illness due to inhumane conditions in the ghettoes.) A relatively few Jewish children were saved by being hidden by courageous Gentiles in various ways, in or close to their Nazi-occupied hometown (see Hidden Children). Another relatively few Jewish children were saved by moving to non-Nazi-occupied lands. Naturally this required the aid of adults - these were saved by the efforts of programs, groups, individuals, or actual parents. In western Europe these would include the Kindertransport program which included the individual efforts of Sir Nicholas Winton; and the work of the French Jewish organization Œuvre de Secours aux Enfants (OSE).The official web-page for OSE is http://www.ose- france.org Most of the programs that worked specifically to save children had the children remain within Western Europe. Other well organized programs did prepare and send children to Palestine.Youth AliyahYouth villageSh'erit ha- Pletah In contrast, in the One Thousand Children \\"program,\\"Jason, Philip K. and Iris Posner, editors, Don't Wave Goodbye: The Children's Flight from Nazi Persecution to American Freedom, Praeger Greenwood Publishers, Westport, Connecticut, 2004.

The One Thousand Children web-pages www.onethousandchildren.yivo.org approximately 1,400 children, nearly all Jewish, were successfully rescued and brought across the ocean to the United States. In general, they were brought in quiet operations designed to avoid negative attention from isolationist and other antisemitic forces. Originally 1,177 such children had been identified as OTC — hence the name the \\"One Thousand Children\\" (OTC). These OTC children: * either came from Europe directly to the United States during the period 1934 to 1945; * were of age up to sixteen (the cut-off age, before they were considered adults). The youngest was fourteen months old; * arrived unaccompanied, leaving their parents behind; and * were usually placed with foster families, schools and other facilities across the U.S. However some came under individual arrangements with various final arrangements. The OTC history is divided into four periods: * the first: 1934, until Kristallnacht on November 9/10, 1938 – during which there were very few OTC; * second: starting with Kristallnacht November 9/10, 1938, which had strongly alerted the American public to the oppression of the Jews in Nazi Germany, until the outbreak of the European War on September 1, 1939; * third: September 1, 1939 until Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941, during the period while Europe was at war but the United States was officially neutral, until Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941, when America joined the war. This was a period when travel from all of Europe to the neutral United States was still permitted, but only if one could obtain the required travel documents; and * fourth: December 7, 1941 until Victory in Europe May 8, 1945. During this period America and Germany were at war, so that legal travel from the Nazi-occupied lands to America was not available. The first small group of six children arrived at New York City in November 1934. This was followed by subsequent small groups, totaling about 100 children annually, that occurred in the early years of operation, and they were taken to foster homes arranged through appeals to congregations and other organizations' members. Most of the children came through programs run by private refugee agencies such as the German Jewish Children's Aid (GJCA).Much information about the GJCA is available from documents kept at the \\"Center for Jewish History\\" http://access.cjh.org/home.php?type=extid&term;=109118#1 The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) as well as the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, (colloquially known as \\"the Joint\\"), HICEM, and the Society of Friends (the Quakers). Many of these efforts were combined to form the U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children (USCOM) which was registered with the US government and later became part of the National War Fund. Fundraising efforts were assisted by the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress, and the National Council of Jewish Women.http://www.thebreman.org/exhibitions/online/1000kids/organizations For instance, many of the OTC were initially gathered together, supported, taken care of, and educated by the French Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants (OSE), sometimes for many months in the OSE \\"chateaux\\" (these were typically very large houses and grounds). They stayed with OSE until OSE able to pass them on to \\"the Joint\\", or the Quakers, which then took them to the United States. Under the leadership of Andree Salomon, OSE did manage to gather together about 350 such children in three large groups, who travelled to America with the aid of the organizations mentioned.OSE-France official web-site www.ose- france.org http://www.ose-france.orgUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum USHMM caption to photo 38351, which shows Andree Salomon and several of these children http://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/pa1125964 Many of these children came from the Gurs internment camp. Other OTC came under private arrangements and sponsorship, typically made by the parent(s) with a family relative or friend. Such children would live with their sponsor, or sometimes live in a boarding school in close contact with their sponsor. Before 1938, only small groups were brought into the country by such organizations, because of concern for anti-semitism and social hostility to allowing foreigners to enter the U.S. during the Depression. The sponsoring organizations wanted to avoid drawing undue attention to the children. Furthermore, their immigration was limited by the U.S. immigration quota system for their countries of origin. The demand on these organizations increased markedly after Kristallnacht on November 9/10, 1940 convinced more European parents that the destruction of Jews was an element of the Nazi agenda. In the later period of 1941–1942, when news of Nazi atrocities was more widely circulated, larger groups of OTC were organized and arrived in the U.S. A few of the OTC came under the British Children's Overseas Reception Board (CORB) program, as well as the \\"U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children\\" (USCOM). In the OTC programs under the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), German Jewish Children's Aid Society,http://access.cjh.org/home.php?type=extid&term;=109118#1 (GJCA), the Quakers, etc., foster families in the U.S. agreed to care for the children until age twenty-one, see that they were educated, and provided a guarantee that they would not become public charges. Most of these children were assigned a social worker from a local social service agency to oversee the child's resettlement process. Jewish children were generally placed in Jewish homes. These children, and their sponsors, expected that they would be reunited with their own families at the end of the war. Most of the children lost one or both parents, and most of their extended families, by the time World War II had ended.  Where the Children Came From, And Some of Their Journeys  Most of the OTC children came from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. Some came from France, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg. Only very very few came directly from Eastern Europe. However, some families of OTC had previously made it from Eastern to Western Europe; and then the OTC child fled from Western Europe. (For instance, this was the case for Wulf Wolodia Grajonca, who later became the \\"rock-and-roll\\" impresario Bill Graham (promoter)) Before the war, many simply managed to get to Hamburg or another port, and sail from there. though this itself was not easy. After the German blitzkrieg of May 1940 through Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg, and rapidly into France, many OTC children fled from Occupied France or Vichy France by going south and west to the Spanish border. Then they made the difficult climb over the Pyrenees, usually guided by a passeur guide/smuggler. From Spain, they traveled to neutral Portugal and Lisbon. From there, they sailed to America, often on one of the Portuguese liners Serpa Pinto (also known as the RMS Ebro), or Mouzinho, or Nyassa. This escape route was also taken by many families. This escape route, through France and over the Pyrenees to Spain, then Portugal and Lisbon, was also followed by those who fled from Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg. Some other OTC children managed to get to Casablanca in North Africa, and sailed from there. It was often the case that whole families made some or all the journey to the port, before the sad parting when the OTC child continued alone. For instance, some French intact families followed a trajectory that led them to one of the French concentration camps such as Gurs. Then OSE was able to extract the child(ren) from that camp, but with the parents still interned. Then OSE would aid the child(ren) over the next OTC stages to their final transport across the Atlantic. In the later stages of this journey, often HIAS, or the \\"Joint\\" would also assist the OTC children.Œuvre de secours aux enfants Remarkably, a similar small group of about 6-8 unaccompanied Jewish children fled to the United States from Venezuela. Their parents, in the small Jewish community in Maracaibo to Venezuela, were well aware of Hitler's possible global threat, which included German submarines off the Venezuelan coast.  The \\"OTC\\" Children  For many of the OTC children, the period before they reached America was very difficult. Before World War II, most were simply assembled by rescue agencies directly from their home towns in Germany and Austria, and then easily escorted to America. But after the war started, nearly all of them went through extreme hardships and dangers before they boarded ship for the United States. Some did travel to the port with parents, but many traveled alone, at least for part of their flight. Some were smuggled over the Pyrenees (usually with their parents). Some were incarcerated for a time in concentration camps such as Gurs internment camp in southern France, while some spent time in a French \\"château\\" (large mansion) run by the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants or OSE. It was usually only late in a journey that a Rescue Agency would start positively escorting the children. Some of the OTC children came by individual arrangements made by their family, in which the child would be sent into the care of a relative in America. In America, they would either live with that family, or perhaps be placed in a boarding school. Many OTC children made notable contributions to American society. Among them are:Sonnert, Gerhard and Gerald Holton \\"What Happened to the Children Who Fled Nazi Persecution\\": . *One OTC (and Kindertransport) child, Jack Steinberger, became a Nobel Laureate in physics. His experiment, done with two others, greatly clarified the understanding of fundamental elementary particle physics at the time. *Another OTC child, Ambassador Richard Schifter, during World War II and shortly afterwards, was one of the Ritchie Boys. The Ritchie Boys were a unit of the U.S. Army, who were chosen because of their excellent language skills in German, Austrian, French, etc., and were trained in military intelligence at Fort Ritchie. They then operated primarily in interrogation on the battlefield during World War II. There were about 20,000, of whom about 2,000 were German or Austrian refugees to America. Several OTC children became Ritchie Boys, or served in the Armed Forces. After his Ritchie Boy stint, Ambassador Schifter had a very significant diplomatic and legal career, and was the U.S. Ambassador for Human Relations at the United Nations. As a child in Austria, his father told him that no Jew could become an Ambassador (in Austria). Schifter did become an American Ambassador to the United Nations, but his father had been already murdered by the Nazis. *Another child Wulf Wolodia Grajonca renamed himself Bill Graham and became prominent in the 1960s as the concert promoter and music venue operator in the rock music and psychedelic rock scene in San Francisco. Bill Graham was the promoter for the musical groups Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. He operated the Fillmore East, Fillmore West, The Fillmore and Winterland Ballroom rock music venues, and organized the large Summer Jam at Watkins Glen and US Festival events before his death in a helicopter crash in 1991. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. *Henri Parens became a child psychiatrist, and wrote several professional books that presented methods he had developed to help children who had been traumatized, such as OTC children. Naturally he made use of his own OTC experience at ages 11–12, and subsequently. In his book \\"Renewal of Life: Healing from the Holocaust\\",\\"Renewal of Life: Healing from the Holocaust\\" by Henri Parens, Schreiber Publishing (2004), Parens explicitly presents his feelings and emotions during his OTC experiences and his later slow \\"healing.\\" *Herbert Freudenberger, a psychologist and author of the book \\"Burn-out: The High Cost of High Achievement\\" (1980) *Arthur Hans Weiss, one of the Ritchie Boys. As a United States military counter intelligence figure, who found Adolf Hitler's last will and political testament in autumn 1945. He later became a lawyer. *Gunther (Guy) Stern was one of the Ritchie Boys, like Ambassador Schifter (above). He then had a distinguished career as a university professor and Holocaust Museum director. *Harry Eckstein (born Horst Eckstein) became a political science professor at Princeton University and the University of California, Irvine.  Emotional and Practical Effects  At the time, the OTC children went through much emotional stress and trauma and practical difficulties in Europe before their arrival in America, also during their initial period in America, and even in later war-time years. At war's end, most OTC children would learn that their parents had been murdered by the Nazis. At that time, they had to adjust to, and create for themselves, another new set of life experiences. As is now well-understood, such stress and trauma will continue to create conscious and unconscious trauma, and their repercussions, for many years. These OTC trauma, both at the time and afterwards, are closely similar to those met by other Child Holocaust Survivors who survived in Europe.Moskovitz, Sarah \\"LOVE DESPITE HATE – Child Survivors of the Holocaust and their Adult Lives.\\" Schocken Books, New York 1983. .Krell, Robert\\"Child Holocaust Survivors, Memories and Reflections.\\" Trafford Publishing, 2007. . Like other Child Holocaust Survivors, the actual experiences and psychological trauma received by the OTC Child Survivors differed fundamentally, crucially and negatively from that of an adult Holocaust Survivor. An adult generally would have developed a sense of self and ego, which would provide him or her with a way of attempting to deal with the practical and emotional trauma. Usually a child has not yet developed a strong ego nor sense of self. Also, a child depends on his or her parents for support and protection, and especially love. Yet for these Child Holocaust Survivors, they lacked their parents and their parents' love; and they only had weakly developed egos and sense of self, at the very time that the external and psychological trauma were most extreme. The first very significant trauma occurred at the moment of parting from their parent(s), whether when boarding ship or at an earlier time and event. For the younger OTC children, regardless of whatever reassuring words the parent(s) might say, the child would feel abandoned by his parents. Even older children, who could understand the reality \\"intellectually,\\" none-the-less would feel as having been abandoned. For the very young children, even though in later years they would have no actual memory of the parting and of these feelings, and also no memory of (part of) the later years, yet the trauma of parting and of continued separation will still have current and continuing subconscious impact. Most OTC children were placed in \\"foster-families,\\" some of which were loving and some not; or sometimes they were placed in various types of institutions, some caring, and some not. But in most cases these could not replace the love and support from his own family; and the new relationship would take time to develop. In some fortunate instances, the OTC child would grow to totally blend into the foster family, and learn to love them as if they were his own parents and siblings. The older OTC children fully knew the dangers their left-behind parents faced from the Nazi threat. And then, at the end of the war, nearly always the OTC child would find out, sooner or later, that his or her parents had been murdered by the Nazis; and there would also have been the prior stress of waiting and hoping, before that final factual discovery. Not surprisingly, some of the OTC children became very angry with their situation. Some would act out, sometimes so much so that their \\"foster- parents\\" decided they had to return the OTC child to the original Organization, such as HIAS, to be placed elsewhere – but then the cycle might repeat. As an example, one OTC child, Phyllis Helene Mattson, also acted out at the \\"Orphanage\\" Institution, where twice she had to be placed – she ultimately stayed with four \\"foster-families,\\" and was in the \\"Orphanage\\" twice. She ran away from two of her \\"foster-families,\\" and one \\"foster-family\\" sent her back to the \\"Orphanage.\\" As she herself writes, it is somewhat remarkable that she managed to become a responsible mature adult. She recounts all this in her book \\"War Orphan in San Francisco\\"War Orphan in San Francisco, by Phyllis Helene Mattson, Stevens Creek Press, 2005 At a more practical level, nearly every OTC child arrived in America not being able to speak English, and so he or she was held behind in school grade placement (though most rapidly learned English, and then advanced rapidly into his proper school-grade). He or she had to adapt to a new culture and way of behaving.  Holocaust Child Survivors - Hidden Children; OTC similarities; Kindertransport; German Government recognizes Kinder; OTC are \\"American Kindertransport,\\" OTC are Holocaust Child Survivors  = Hidden Children of the Holocaust; OTC had similar trauma; OTC are Holocaust Child Survivors = Hidden Children Much about the Hidden Children was included in an Exhibition held at the United States Holocaust Museum (USHMM) in 2006: \\"Life in Shadows.\\" http://www.ushmm.org/exhibition/hidden-children/indexEven more information can be found at the hyperlinks in the prior reference: http://www.ushmm.org/exhibition/hidden-children/indexA related Exhibition at the Museum of Jewish Heritage, NYCH, also described the Hidden ChildrenThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is a source for information about the Hidden Children - here the ADL describes, with photos, a few Child Survivors, not all being Hidden Children https://www.adl.org/education/educator-resources/lesson- plans/children-of-the-holocaust-a-discussion-guide of the Holocaust are those children who were hidden in some way during the Holocaust from the Nazis in occupied Europe, hidden so as to avoid capture by the Nazis. One sub-group even of Hidden Children are children who, during the Holocaust, were placed into the care of a \\"foster-family,\\" usually Catholic, and raised as-if one of the family. These Hidden Children were saved from murder by the Nazis. None- the-less all of them, including those in \\"foster-families,\\" suffered great trauma at the time, and also later both consciously and subconsciously.Robert Krell, \\"Child Holocaust Survivors, Memories and Reflections.\\" Trafford Publishing, 2007. . OTC children went through very significant trauma, both in terms of the psychological and the practical – caused by the Holocaust. These trauma in large part correspond to many aspects of those trauma developed by the \\"foster-family\\" sub-group of the Hidden Children – Child Survivors who had been raised as-if one of a (generally Catholic) family. The OTC trauma similarly was caused by the Holocaust. For this reason alone, we see that OTC are Child Survivors of the Holocaust. = Kindertransport; OTC are \\"American Kindertransport;\\" German Government creates payment Fund and recognizes \\"British\\" Kindertransport as Holocaust Child Survivors; Similarly OTC are Holocaust Child Survivors = The OTC are the \\"American Kindertransport.\\" The Kindertransport Program is discussed in more detail in a later section. Here, we only need to know that, during the period between Kristallnacht and the start of World War II, the Kindertransport Program brought about 10,000 Jewish children to England from Germany, German-annexed Austria, and German-occupied Czechoslovakia - but the children ( _kinder_ ) had been forced to flee by themselves, and forced to leave their parents behind. (Nearly all the children's parents were later murdered by the Nazis.} In November 2018, the German Government announced a \\"Kindertransport Fund\\" that would pay each surviving Kindertransport \\"child\\" a token symbolic amount of 2,500 Euros (about $2,850 at that time).http://www.claimscon.org/2018/12/kindertransport/ This was intended to be in recognition of the especial trauma these Kindertransport had suffered as _children_ during their flight from Hitler, but that they had had to flee unaccompanied, and forced to leave their parents behind. The German Government created this Fund precisely to recognize that the Kinder were Child Survivors of the Holocaust. The OTC, as _children_ suffered exactly the same trauma as did the kinder. This is the second reason that we see that the OTC are Child Survivors of the Holocaust.  Research and discovery  The fact that some unaccompanied children fled from Europe directly to the U.S.A. was first researched by Judith Baumel-SchwartzBaumel, Judith T. \\"Unfulfilled Promise.\\" Denali Press, Juneau, AK. 1990. in a doctoral thesis and related book. However, only in 2000 did Iris Posner have the realization and then implement it, that these children should be considered a significant distinct group of Holocaust Survivors, which should be discussed in the truly public domain. Specifically, in 2000, Iris Posner had learned of the British Government-assisted Kindertransport effort, and was intrigued by the question of whether there was a similar actual official American Government effort. Posner wrote letters to newspapers asking any such children to contact her. Posner and Leonore Moskowitz also researched ship manifests and other documents. In this way, Posner \\"created\\" the story of this group of unaccompanied children to America (\\"The One Thousand Children,\\" as she later named them). At that time, they managed to identify slightly over 1,000, hence the name. Posner and Moskowitz managed to locate about 500 of these who were still alive, and invited each of them to the 2002 OTC Conference. Soon after, in 2001, Posner and Moskowitz jointly founded the non- profit organization The One Thousand Children, Inc. Posner and Moskowitz, under the aegis of their organization \\"The One Thousand Children, Inc\\" organized a three-day International OTC Conference and Reunion in Chicago in 2002. Approximately 200 attendees had the opportunity to listen and interact with over 50 speakers drawn from OTC children, their children and grandchildren, and \\"foster\\" family members and rescuers from rescue organizations. At the time of the Conference in 2002, they had found the names of about 1,200 OTC'ers.There exists a data-base of 1,177 _potential_ OTC as of 5 April 2001, https://www.ushmm.org/online/hsv/source_view.php?SourceId=20638. It is available _only_ to researchers, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.YIVO also has some data-bases, again available _only_ to researchers. Since that time the known number has increased to about 1400.  American \\"Response\\"  The OTC story is somewhat similar to that of the kindertransport in which unaccompanied children came from mainland Europe to Great Britain. In contrast to the OTC 'program,\\" the British kindertransport program was officially created by the British Government in very speedy response to kristallnacht on Nov 9/10, 1938. Within six days the British Government presented an official bill in Parliament which was rapidly passed, which waived all immigration and visa requirements for unaccompanied children, though it left actual arrangements to private relief organizations and individual sponsors. In contrast, the United States did not change any immigration laws. In 1939, the proposed Wagner–Rogers Bill to admit 20,000 Jewish refugees under the age of 14 to the United States from Nazi Germany, cosponsored by Sen. Robert F. Wagner (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Edith Rogers (R-Mass.), failed to get Congressional approval in 1939. Jewish organizations did not feel able to challenge this decision. The full story of the failure of the Wagner-Rogers bill shows the power of the isolationist (and antisemitic?) forces at that time.https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/children-in- europe-are-europes-problem Even the Ickes plan for settling Jews in Alaska, known as the Slattery Report, did not come to any success. Furthermore, the State Department had a deliberately obstructionist \\"Paper Walls\\" policy in operation to delay or prevent the issuing of any officially permitted visas for all refugees who desired entry to America.\\",Wyman, David S. The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust 1941–1945 (Pantheon, New York) , particularly Chapter 7 pp 124–142\\"FDR and the Jews\\" by Richard Breitman and Allan J. Lichtman tells some of the other lack of support for early actions against Hitler, and for Jewish refugees in general. This Paper Wall contributed to the low number of refugees. From July 1941 all immigration applications went to a special inter-departmental committee, and under the \\"relatives rule\\" special scrutiny was given to any applicant with relatives in German, Italian or Russian territory. Beginning in July 1943, a new State Department visa application form over four feet long was used, with details required of the refugee and of the two sponsors; and six copies had to be submitted. Applications took about nine months, and were not expedited even in cases of imminent danger. Furthermore, from fall 1943, applications from refugees \\"not in acute danger\\" could be refused (e.g. people who had reached Spain, Portugal or North Africa). This created a huge barrier, since many of these children (usually with their parents) had fled there from other parts of Europe, some by being smuggled over the Pyrenees. The American public also resisted the OTC program, because of social hostility to allowing foreigners to enter the U.S. during the Depression, and generally from isolationist and antisemitic forces.).  Some of the Groups of OTC Sailings, and their Rescuers  * The \\"Brith Sholom\\" Group of 50 OTC, who were rescued in 1938 by Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus. Their detailed story is presented in a later section. * In June 1942, about 50 OTC sailed from Casablanca for New York on board the Serpa Pinto. They had been helped originally by OSE in France. Then the American Friends Service Committee helped them to leave France from Marseilles to Casablanca, under the auspices of the U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children (USCOM) (and see that WIKI section). * 3 groups totalling 311 OTC, who sailed from Lisbon, who were helped by OSE and specifically by Andree Salomon.https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/pa1125964  Iris Posner's contributions to the OTC storyThis section briefly summarizes and highlights statements already referenced previously  Iris Posner's contributions started with her \\"discovering\\" and \\"creating\\" the One Thousand Children as a concept. Posner and Moskowitz then went on to search for information about these OTC children – their names and other OTC information – and then searched for the actual OTC \\"children.\\" Posner and Moskowitz then put on the 2002 OTC Conference (see above). Posner created the OTC story. Posner provided the new \\"One Thousand Children\\" group-identity for these children. Posner enabled these children to realize they were \\"Child Survivors of the Holocaust.\\" Posner caused all Holocaust groups and scholars to recognize this \\"new\\" group of Holocaust Child Survivors.\\"  Personal Realization that They were \\"Child Survivors of the Holocaust\\"  It was at this 2002 OTC Conference that many of the OTC Children first realized that they had two new identities – both as OTC, and as \\"Child Survivors of the Holocaust.\\" They realized that they truly were Child Survivors of the Holocaust. For a very emphatic audio- visual statement by an OTC that she indeed was a Child Survivor of the Holocaust, listen to her YouTube testimony https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAm5JHKqL1E  One Thousand Children, Inc (OTC, Inc.)  Iris Posner and Leonore Moskowitz created the non-profit research and education organization One Thousand Children, Inc (OTC, Inc.), whose primary purposes are to maintain a connection between the OTC children, to explore this little-known segment of American history, and to create archival materials and depositories. OTC,Inc's print, photo, and audio-visual archives, and some of its activities have been transferred to the \\"YIVO Institute for Jewish Research\\" though OTC, Inc itself has ceased to exist (see next section).  Video Summation of the OTC Experience, and the \\"Disbanding\\" of OTC, Inc in Oct 2013  OTC, Inc. formally disbanded in Oct 2013, but its work goes on. The \\"closing\\" took place at a two-hour conferencehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XosFr7g580c at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. Testimony by individual OTC'ers make up a significant part of this conference.  British Kindertransport, and Compared with the One Thousand Children Effort  A larger but similar British program, the Kindertransport, is more well-known. That effort brought approximately 10,000 similarly defined mainly Jewish children to the United Kingdom, between November 21, 1938 and September 3, 1939. It had to stop at that date, since that was the beginning of World War II. The Kindertransport program was created by the British Government which within six days of Kristallnacht presented an Act in the British Parliament. This act waived all visa and immigration requirements for an unspecified number of unaccompanied children. Naturally, the children had to be privately financed and guaranteed, and placed by various British Jewish Organizations. (Some of the \\"kinder\\" from Britain subsequently migrated to America, e.g. the Nobel Prize-winning scientists Arno Penzias and Walter Kohn.) In contrast, the United States Government did nothing to aid any of the OTC children, and did not waive any quota or immigration requirements. The 12-year OTC effort required each OTC child to meet the American immigration requirements.Wyman, David S. The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust 1941–1945 (Pantheon, New York) , particularly Chapter 7  OTC Archived Documents and Other Media Are Now Mainly at the \\"YIVO Institute for Jewish Research\\"  The Organization's archives have been donated to and now reside at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research http://www.yivo.org in New York City. These primary archives include video-recordings of the complete 2002 OTC Conference as well as partial written transcripts. Many artifacts, including personal diaries written as children or later as adults, are included; as well as data about each individual (identified) child, other information, and photographs. This archive is open to scholars. The list of the 1177 originally-identified OTC'ers, with names and many other details, is at YIVO.

Story of the Rescue of 50 Brith Sholom OTC Children  Some of the OTC children were rescued by Jewish organizations such as HIAS. But some were rescued by individuals. For example, one American 51 year-old bachelor distant cousin sponsored and took official responsibility for a six-year-old OTC'er, but the OTC'er had to be placed in a small year-round boarding-school\\"Claude Kacser's OTC Story\\" cited below, in the section of \\"Videos\\" below. A remarkable rescue was made by a private wealthy Philadelphia family, Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus. On their own, they rescued 25 boys and 25 girls from Vienna after Kristallnacht, but before the war in Europe started. They had many practical difficulties, including those to obtain the necessary 50 American visas from within the immigration quota system. On arrival, these children were first placed in the summer camp facilities of the fraternal order Brith Sholom, and then were placed into the homes of Philadelphia families.This story is presented in detail inThis story was also made into a documentary film shown on PBS.

Anon., \\"Unusual Optical Development made Possible by Cooperation of Local Industries,\\" RAR, VII (1929), no. 3, 72-73. During World War I, many American defense companies relied heavily on German optics. The need for an American-based institution of optical training became apparent when the flow of German imports, including optics, attenuated. The Institute of Optics has long been deeply involved in American optics study and research. The Optical Society of America was founded in 1916 by 30 optical scientists and instrument makers based in Rochester. The proximity of Rochester to many optical companies has provided an excellent environment for collaboration with industry, as well as funding for research. These companies include Xerox, Eastman Kodak, Corning Glass Works, Bausch and Lomb, and many others. The Institute of Optics occupied the top floor of Bausch and Lomb Hall from 1931 to 1977. Currently, the Institute is primarily housed in the Wilmot Building on the River Campus of the University of Rochester; construction began in 1961 with support from NASA, as well as other buildings and centers, including the Laboratory for Laser Energetics.

He is regarded as one of Cork's greatest ever players. Born in Douglas on the south side of Cork city, Bennett was introduced to hurling in his youth. The lack of an underage structure with the Douglas club prompted his move to Blackrock where he quickly joined the senior team. Bennett went on to enjoy a successful career with the club and won two county senior championship medals. As Gaelic footballer with St. Michael's, he finished his club career with Douglas. Bennett made his debut on the inter-county scene when he was added to the Cork senior panel for the 1960 championship. Over the next few years he found it difficult to establish himself on the team, however, by 1966 he was a regular in the forward line. Bennett won a set of All-Ireland and Munster medals that year. He played his last game for Cork in July 1968. In 1965 Bennett lined out with the Munster inter-provincial team, however, he never won a Railway Cup medal. In retirement from playing Bennett became involved in team management and administrative affairs. He was a selector with the Blackrock senior team before serving as club chairman for six years. As a selector with the Cork senior team Bennett helped guide the team to Munster and National Hurling League successes in 1972. Bennett died on 10 August 2016. Playing career =Club= Although eligible to play with the Douglas club, Bennett transferred to Blackrock who were in the midst of a 25-year era without success. In 1954 he was at right wing-forward as Blackrock qualified for their first county final in six years. The Rockies fielded a young team, however, Glen Rovers had eight inter-county players on their team and held a 2-4 to 0-2 half-time lead. Bennett's side fought back after the interval with goals from Eddie John O'Sullivan, Tom Furlong and Seán Horgan, leaving the result in doubt up to the end. At the full-time whistle Blackrock were defeated by 3-7 to 3-2. Two years later in 1956 Blackrock qualified for a second county final in three years, with Glen Rovers providing the opposition once again. The Glen were now regarded as a team in transition and were defeated by a Mick Cashman-captained Rockies on a scoreline of 2-10 to 2-2. It was Bennett's first championship medal and a first for Blackrock since 1931. After a six-point defeat by Glen Rovers in 1959, Blackrock were back in yet another county final in 1961. North Cork divisional side Avondhu were the opponents on that occasion and a fast-paced and high-scoring game developed over the hour. At the full-time whistle Blackrock were the champions by 4-10 to 3-7, with Bennett collecting a second championship medal. =Inter- county= Bennett first played for Cork as a member of the senior hurling team. He made his senior championship debut on 31 July 1960 when he came on as a substitute in Cork's 4-13 to 4-11 Munster final defeat by Tipperary. After a decade in the wilderness Cork bounced back in 1966. A 4-9 to 2-9 defeat of Waterford in the provincial decider gave him his first Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 4 September 1966 pitted Kilkenny against Cork for the first time in nineteen years. Kilkenny were the favourites, however, a hat-trick of goals from Colm Sheehan gave Cork a merited 3-9 to 1-10 victory over an Eddie Keher-inspired Kilkenny. Not only was it a first championship for Cork in twelve years, but it was Bennett's first All-Ireland medal. Bennett retired from inter-county hurling following Cork's exit from the championship in 1968.

The school is named after Saint Peter Canisius. It is known as one of Berlin's most prestigious schools.Jan-Martin Wiarda: Schulkampf in Berlin. In: Die Zeit, 10. März 2005  Jesuit college  Canisius College Berlin is a Jesuit high school in the tradition of Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits. In this tradition it offers reflection trips – so-called \\"oases\\" – social internships, stays abroad, and youth work in the ISG. Canisius is one of three Jesuit colleges in Germany. Unlike the Kolleg St. Blasien and Aloisiuskolleg, however, it has no boarding school. The school is located in a central but also very calm area next to a large park called \\"Tiergarten\\". This is near the Potsdamer Platz in the so-called \\"diplomatic district\\" near numerous embassies, including those of Italy, Japan, and Saudi Arabia and other political and economic organizations like CDU's headquarters and KPMG. Just south of the campus on Köbi Road are two American nettle trees which because of their beauty are considered a national monument in the city of Berlin. School Canisius College, like the Französisches Gymnasium Berlin French school and the Grey Monastery, receives hundreds of applications each year, as the most popular schools in Berlin. About 90 students are accepted in each class, grades five through thirteen. The majority of students are baptized Roman Catholic, with about 20% Protestant. Tuition is €80 per month (€960 per year), which is subsidized by the school for families that have difficulty paying. Financial support comes from Canisius Kolleg Friends and Supporters and from the Canisius College Foundation. =Courses and extracurriculars= Religion is a compulsory subject up to high school. It can also be chosen for credit in high school. English and Latin are taken from the fifth grade, and after the eighth grade there is a choice of ancient Greek or French, together with natural science. Japanese may be taken from the ninth grade through high school, but not as advanced course. Working groups offer additional foreign languages. Students can participate in sports, artistic and musical clubs such as photography, literary writing, or theater. = School trips and study abroad = Class trips usually take place once in the lower level (grades 5-7), in the middle class (8-10), and in the upper stage (11-13). In the middle class, a student exchange is often held instead of a class trip. In the seventh, eighth, ninth, and twelfth grades students in a class can voluntarily join a teacher who accompanies them for reflection and retreats. During the eleventh grade students have the opportunity to go abroad for one year. As a rule, the students have to repeat that school year in Germany; though the school management can wave this. =Social internship= Since the school year 1987/1988, a four-week service internship has been binding for tenth or eleventh graders. Service takes place mostly in facilities for the disabled, the homeless, children, or people in nursing homes. The purpose is to give students some exposure to \\"the marginalized, disadvantaged, ostracized, those deprived of their rights and dignity or forced for other reasons to live in difficult conditions.\\" History of Canisius College 280px The Jesuits were banned in the German Reich from 1872 to 1917. Then in 1925, at the suggestion of Bishop Josef Deitmer and through the initiative of Bernhard Lichtenberg \\"the establishment of a private Catholic higher educational institution for male youth\\" was established. However, the Ministry of Culture forbade using the name Canisius College, so the college officially received its name from its location in Berlin-Charlottenburg: Gymnasium at the Lietzensee. Beginning of the 1930s, the school had about 500 students, making it the second largest boys' school in Germany. From 1936 the National Socialist government gradually decreed the closure of the school, which was complete by March 1940. During the Second World War, the old school building was completely destroyed. At its refounding on 1 June 1945 the school was officially named Canisius-Kolleg Berlin. Fr. Klein, S.J., appealed to the Allied Control Council on behalf of the five Catholic secondary schools for resumption of their school activities, receiving approval in the spring of 1946. Teaching was conducted in different places in the city. After acquisition of the building in 1947 and its restoral with the help of the pupils, the school was opened that year with 500 pupils in twelve classes. Until 1974, Canisius College was an all-boys high school, but then became coeducational. =The plot= Since the 16th century the Tiergarten was a fenced hunting area, whose southern end reached today's Tiergartenstraße. The area south of the Tiergarten remained undeveloped. At the end of the 18th century wealthy Berlin citizens began to build summer and country houses there. In 1799, the royal councillor Mölter built a country house on plot 31 Tiergartenstraße with Friedrich Gilly as architect; the adjacent plot 30 remained undeveloped. In 1863 the banker David Hansemann had architect Friedrich Hitzig design a villa on plots 30/31. The house was preserved until its demolition in 1936. In the first half of the 20th century, Tiergartenstraße became the diplomatic quarter; especially from 1938 with the construction of the \\"Germanic World Capital\\" foreign representatives were relocated here. After the Second World War Tiergartenstraße was initially in ruins, largely a wasteland – a condition that changed only slowly after the fall of the Berlin Wall. =Krupp headquarters to Jesuits= Alfred Delp guest house The Krupp firm acquired the Tiergartenstraße 30/31 property in 1936. There they built their Berlin headquarters, since the 1933 plans for Berlin forced them to relinquish their previous premises. The headquarters was more than an administrative building; it included housing for the owner's family and guest apartments for senior staff. Paul Mebes and Paul Emmerich were the architects, and completed their work in 1937. The building was slightly damaged in the Second World War, but remained mostly intact along with its furnishings. In 1947 Krupp gave up its headquarters in Berlin and sold the house to the Jesuits. In 1999/2000, the facade and the entrance of the building were restored, with help from Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation. The building was enlarged in 1979/1980 and again in 1999/2000. It is now a historical monument. The guest house on the grounds of the College is named after the Jesuit Alfred Delp (1907-1945), sentenced to death for high treason in 1944.  Alumni  After finishing school, former students sometimes retain connections. All former pupils of the Aloisiuskolleg, Kolleg St. Blasien, and the Canisius-Kolleg Berlin can contact each other and see current addresses in the data base at the Stellaner webpage.Stellaner webpage Accessed 21 November 2016.  Allegations of child sexual abuse  In 2004 and 2005, two former students of the school told the headmaster of the school that they had been sexually abused by two of their former teachers in the 1970s and in the 1980s. In December 2009 and January 2010, two other boys contacted the headmaster and claimed the same about the same teachers. The headmaster decided to write a letter to all former students in which he stated that he was deeply sorry for what happened. An investigative report detailing allegations of substantial abuse was released in 2010, with abuse ranging from beating on the bare buttocks\\"Report Outlines Abuse Claims at German Jesuit Schools\\" article by Judy Dempsay in The New York Times May 27, 2010 to more overt sexual abuse on the part of three Jesuits. More apologies and financial compensations were issued to the sex abuse victims as well.

History  Antioch College was established in 1852 in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Horace Mann, educator, social reformer, abolitionist, and one of the creators of the US public school system was its first president. Mann's goal, which he achieved, was to create a university that would be nonsectarian, coeducational, and that did not utilize a conventional grading system. In 1863, Antioch approved a policy that no applicant was to be rejected on the basis of race. It was also among the first colleges to offer the same curriculum to men and women students. \\"The Antioch Story,\\" AUSB General Catalog 2007-2009.

Born in Newcestown, County Cork, Crowley first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Cork minor team, before later lining out with the under-21 side. He made his senior debut in the 1976–77 National Hurling League. Crowley went on to play a key part for almost a decade, and won three All-Ireland medals, seven Munster medals and two National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. Crowley represented the Munster inter-provincial team at various times throughout his career, winning one Railway Cup medal. At club level he won two junior championship medals with Newcestown. Throughout his career Crowley made 29 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling on following Cork's exit from the 1985 championship. Playing career Tim Crowley was born Newcestown in County Cork in 1952. He showed great skill as a hurler in his youth, and in time he would go on to have a very successful career with his native county. Crowley joined the Cork minor hurling team in the mid 1960s. In 1969 he had his first major success when he won his first All-Ireland medal as a minor. In 1970 he captured his second consecutive All-Ireland medal at minor level. Crowley subsequently joined the Cork under-21 team with whom he won an All- Ireland medal in 1973, along with other future stars Seánie O'Leary and Jimmy Barry-Murphy. Crowley had to wait another few years before he joined the senior team, however, he made his senior debut against Waterford in 1977. He partnered Tom Cashman at midfield and subsequently went on to claim his first Munster and All-Ireland medals at senior level. In 1978 Crowley was moved to the half-forward line on the team. It was another successful year as he claimed his second consecutive Munster and All-Ireland titles. In 1979 he won his third Munster medal, however, Cork’s attempt to capture four All-Ireland titles in-a-row was halted at the All-Ireland semi-final stage when Crowley’s team were defeated by Galway. In 1980 and 1981 Cork failed to win further Munster titles, however, Crowley was a key member of the team that won back- to-back National Hurling League titles in those years. In 1982 Cork had recaptured their form, and Crowley captured a fourth Munster medal, however, Cork were later defeated by Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final. In 1983 Crowley won his fifth Munster title, however, Cork were once again defeated by Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final. 1984 was a very special year in the history of the Gaelic Athletic Association. It was the centenary year of the association, and every team was hopeful of championship success. Crowley won his sixth Munster title with Cork, a win which qualified the team for a very special All-Ireland final appearance at Semple Stadium. In the first ever championship meeting of Cork and Offaly Crowley played at centre-forward. With a seven-point win over the midlanders Crowley claimed his third All-Ireland medal. By 1985 Crowley was in the twilight of his inter-county career. He won a seventh Munster title, however, his side were beaten by Galway in the All- Ireland semi-final.

Early life Nat Nakasa was born in outside Durban on 12 May 1937 to mother Alvina who was a teacher while his father Chamberlain was a typesetter and writer. He would be one of five children. He attended the mission school at the Zulu Lutheran High School in Eshowe completing his junior certificate. Journalism After leaving school, aged seventeen he returned to Durban and after many jobs, two friends helped him find a job a year later as a junior reporter at the Ilanga Lase Natal, a Zulu language weekly. After his reporting attracted the attention of Sylvester Stein of the Drum magazine, he joined the magazine in 1957. He and the other journalists writings at the Drum were influenced by the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950 and had to show the effects of Apartheid indirectly on black lives without condemning it directly for fear of being banned from practising journalism. With the Sharpville Massacre of 1960, the world took an interest in South Africa and so in 1961, he was asked to write an article entitled The Human Meaning of Apartheid for The New York Times.Drum struggled to keep its black writers due to the severe restriction they found themselves in and many went into exile in Europe or America. In 1963, he announced the formation of a quarterly literary magazine called The Classic, a magazine in English for African intellectual writers and poets from any race around Africa. The first year's printing would be funded by Professor John Thompson of the Farfield Foundation, that unknown to Nakasa was funded by the CIA in order to cultivate a pro-American intellectual elite around the world. It first published in June 1963 and would feature writers such as Can Themba, Ezekiel Mphahlele, and Casey Motsisi. Doris Lessing and Leopold Senghor would feature in other issues and would later be edited by writer Barney Simon. In 1963, the Publications and Entertainment Act was passed which allowed the South African government broad powers to ban or censor content it deemed unfavourable to the interest of the country, further hindering Nakasa's work as he attempted to stay within the law. In 1964, Nakasa applied for a Nieman Fellowship, a journalism program at Harvard University out of fear for his future employment prospects in South Africa and was accepted for 1965 intake. At the same time, Allister Sparks, editorial page editor of the white anti- apartheid newspaper the Rand Daily Mail invited Nakasa to write a black perspective column for the paper.On accepting a Nieman Fellowship, Nakasa applied for a passport, but like many other black intellectuals, was refused and would have to accept an exit permit instead which meant relinquishing his citizenship and not being allowed to return to South Africa. Unbeknown to Nakasa, the South African police had been monitoring him since 1959 and were about to issue him with a five-year banning order under the Suppression of Communism Act when he left for the United States in October 1964. Nakasa soon found that racism existed in America as well, albeit more subtly. Nakasa didn't like New York City and soon moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts where he spent his time at Harvard steeped in the somber business of education. While attending the Nieman Fellowship, he participated in protest meetings against Apartheid at Cambridge, Massachusetts and in Washington DC and unsuccessfully attempted again to write an article for The New York Times. He completed his Nieman Fellowship at the end of June 1965, by which time he was short of money and his attempted to extend his visa beyond August seemed unsuccessful. Now living in Harlem, he wrote articles for several newspapers after leaving Harvard, appeared in the television film The Fruit of Fear and was planning to write a biography of Miriam Makeba. But two days before his death he told a friend, I can't laugh anymore and when I can't laugh I can't write. Nakasa seemed homesick, unable to return to South Africa, unsettled and drinking, he became depressed and confessed to friend Nadine Gordimer that he was worried he had inherited his mother's mental illness. On 14 July 1965, he committed suicide when he jumped from his friend's seventh story apartment. Death As it was not possible to bring his body home, he was buried at the Ferncliff cemetery in upstate New York. A headstone placed by the Nieman Foundation 30 years later simply reads: Reburial A project was begun in May 2014 to return his body to South Africa. His remains were returned to South Africa on 19 August 2014. \\"This will hopefully bring closure to a horrific chapter that has remained a blight in our history for almost 50 years. His homecoming is the restoration of his citizenship and dignity as a human being\\", said Nathi Mthethwa, South Africa's minister of arts and culture.“ He was re-buried on 13 September 2014 near his childhood home in Chesterville, a township outside Durban. The ceremony was preceded by a procession of his coffin through Chesterville before his remains were interred at Chesterville's Heroes Acre.

MilSim, in general, is any activity that strives to provide an experience of military involvement without planning to actually engage in real armed conflicts. There are several different forms of MilSim: simple cosplaying that only focuses on stylistic imitation of military personnel and equipments; historical reenactment of famous battles; physical shooting sport (e.g. airsoft, paintball or laser tag) based on military scenarios and team tactics, with an emphasis on realism; and military-themed esports (e.g. video games). Weapons used in physically-involved MilSim activities are commonly either non- functional props, replicas firing blanks, or toy guns that are safe to shoot at other humans. Airsoft guns are used more often in MilSim due to their cosmetic realism, satisfactory external ballistics, compatibility with genuine firearm accessories, and inexpensive ammunition. MilSim events can span between scripted historical/imaginary military battles, law enforcement-style CQC engagements, or freestyle squad/platoon-level urban/jungle warfare-themed light infantry skirmishes. Large events usually have rigid requirements for entry, and can span between hours and several days without leaving the playfield. The experience often includes camping, food preparation and transportation logistics. MilSim differs from the sports of airsoft or paintball - though both rely on tactics and marksmanship, MilSim has a focus on realism and authenticity to real-world military doctrines. There are often fireteams with designated roles, such as simulated combat medics and support gunners. Loosely originating in Japan in the 1980s, MilSim events are now worldwide, bolstered by an active and expanding Internet scene. American presenter MSATO claims that MilSim is \\"fastest-growing extreme sport worldwide.\\" The largest events can attract hundreds or thousands of attendees, though players must source their own equipment, such as specific uniforms, radios, and weapons. The attendees are diverse, consisting of hobbyists, military veterans, or those as young as 13. Events range in intensity & requirements. In the United Kingdom, airsoft event organizers run in conjunction with Live Action Role-Players (see LARP) at British Army training facilities, such as Copehill Down and Catterick Garrison. Other combat stages are salvaged from abandoned buildings and private woodland. Many of the larger playfields are leased to ROTC groups or civilian first-responders for simulation training. Reenactments G36E. Similar to historical reenactments, MilSim reenactments have a focus on historical accuracy to a specific event. All weaponry, uniforms, and equipment are required or suggested to be period-accurate. Food, terminology, and living arrangements can be inspired by the period. Events can be generally 'themed', such as World War II, Desert Storm, or the Yugoslav Wars. Sides are usually not glorified, and attendees are encouraged to see battles through the eyes of a soldier. Unlike historical reenactments, which use choreographed actors, the general public is participating under a set of rules. The outcome of battles can change, as players act with autonomy. When attendees must source their own equipment, costs can sometimes be thousands of dollars. Occasionally, loaner equipment is provided to beginners. The world's largest D-Day reenactment, Oklahoma D-Day, features parades, flag raisings, salutes, and reunions, culminating in a \\"5,000-player rally for the climactic surge at Colleville\\". War historians are occasionally consulted to help stage the field. Regularly, military veterans from several nations will attend or organize events, giving further accuracy to first-aid training, current terminology, clothing, and tactics. Some event organizers, especially those located in the former Soviet Bloc, have access to genuine military tanks, APCs, trucks, and rarely helicopters, which are employed on the field. Simulations MilSim simulations are fictionalized scenarios with a realistic objective. Simulations can include hostage rescue, bomb defusal, or fictionalized skirmishes, and include law enforcement or militia-themed scenarios. These promote a \\"tactical playstyle\\" above casual airsoft. Players are often given an extensive briefing, containing storylines, mission tactics, and rules of engagement. Most simulations strive for immersion and tension in players. MilSim simulations are usually smaller and more frequent than reenactments. Uses A French MilSim group. Robert Silverman of Vocativ, embedded in a two-day MilSim (inspired by 2003's Tears of the Sun), writes that \\"the appeal is in ... the realism of an unreal world, plus a deep desire for the camaraderie and teamwork you'd find in a real military unit.\\" He speculates that the \\"pure adrenaline free from inflicting actual harm ... strikes at something embedded deeply within the core of sports.\\" Places Journal, referring to the presence of veteran and civilian players, describes MilSim as a \\"ladder leading up to war and a ladder for coming back down\\". Notably, veterans (rather than, or in addition to, mental health care) \\"use war games as self-administered PTSD treatment\\". Recently, advances in airsoft replica authenticity have led numerous law enforcement and military units to train with airsoft guns in CQB/CQC environments. MilSim events have encouraged the US Army to promote enlistment. Video games Mil-sim is also a genre of video games, sometimes overlapping with the tactical shooter genre, wherein there are more \\"realistic\\" mechanics and consequences compared to other first- person shooters or action games. Games such as ArmA are a realistic simulation of equipment and tactics, rather than pure entertainment, and are sometimes used to train soldiers. Other games, such as the Red Orchestra series or the Battlefield series, feature some realistic aspects in their gameplay. Mil-sims can be differentiated from other shooter games in that, usually: *Firearms are modeled after real life. Bullets are grouped by magazines (rather than an invisible ammo pool), gunshot wounds are mostly fatal, and bullets are physically simulated, requiring the player to account for wind and gravity. *The games' systems account for various needs. Vehicles may have limited cargo space, and characters can become severely fatigued. Hunger and thirst may also deplete. *Community-run MilSim events, within these video games, often have players undergo \\"training\\". A player might be trained in military tactics that will give them an advantage in the game.

His first appearance was in Exciting Comics #15 (December 1941), published by Nedor Comics. The character was later revived by writer Alan Moore for America's Best Comics. Nedor Comics The Liberator is the secret identity of Dr. Nelson Drew, a chemistry teacher at fictional Claflin University. He discovers an ancient Egyptian formula called Lamesis that gives him superhuman strength and speed. Drew uses his powers as the Liberator to fight Nazi saboteurs during World War II. The formula sometimes wears off, turning the Liberator back into Dr. Drew at inopportune moments. The Liberator debuted in Exciting Comics #15, and appeared regularly in that title and America's Best Comics (not to be confused with the later DC Comics imprint). His last Golden Age appearance was in Exciting Comics #35 (October 1944). America's Best Comics Alan Moore revived the Liberator, along with many other Nedor Comics characters, for his Tom Strong series. In Tom Strong #12 (June 2001), the Liberator was revealed to have been one of the members of SMASH that had been placed in suspended animation after an alien invasion from the moon in 1969. Awakened 30 years later, the Liberator joined his former comrades in the fight against the alien. SMASH disbanded shortly thereafter, but reformed three years later. The Liberator is a member of the reformed group. Dynamite Entertainment Currently, The Liberator is one of dozens of Golden Age superhero characters appearing in Dynamite Entertainment's Project Superpowers line of comics. The basic premise is that The Fighting Yank spent years imprisoning all of his fellow heroes in the mystical Urn of Pandora, mistakenly thinking that it would bring about the end of all evil; The Liberator was one of those heroes. Decades later, the Urn was broken and the heroes freed. As seen in the Black Terror miniseries, The Liberator is now one of several patriotic-themed heroes who protect the U.S. president and America's interests, even if this pits them against their fellow heroes.

The Family The old Florentine aristocratic family produced several generations of noteworthy citizens who enhanced and enabled many different aspects of both the Florentine political life and economic market during the 17th, 18th and 19th century. Although the origins of the Fenzi family can be traced back to the Italian Renaissance, it was not until the mid 17th century that the fortune of the family was to become as substantial as the name Fenzi during the 18th and 19th century. The main founder of the Fenzi dynasty was Francesco Fenzi, who became financial adviser and creditor to the Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo of Tuscany at the end of the 17th century; from that point onwards the family fortunes were to rise in connection with the financing of both private and public initiatives. The Fenzi family was to benefit from all the notable privileges of the nobility such as tax exemptions granted by the favors of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. One of the most successful Fenzis was Cavalier Emanuele Fenzi 1784 - 1875, elder son of Cavalier Jacopo Orazio Fenzi, a Magistrate in the Florentine courts. By 1805 Emanuele had already established himself as a successful entrepreneur working for Bosi, Mazzarelli & C. By 1810 his reputation and talent as an entrepreneur were so well recognized in the trade that he decided to set up his own firm la Bandi, Orsi, Fenzi & C. making and selling tobacco. In this same year he acquired a Palazzo in the centre of Florence, where he set up his headquarters. By 1820 the tobacco industry had grown to such an extent due to Emanuele's entrepreneurial initiatives and the extension of trade in Italy and Europe that by 1821 Emanuele had accumulated enough wealth to establish the Fenzi Bank. By 1829 the Bank was established in what today known as the Fenzi Palace via San Gallo, one of the best addresses in Florence. In 1860 Emanuele Fenzi became Senator. He later built the Palazzo Fenzi on Piazza della Signoria (designed by Giuseppi Martelli), and now the Assicurazioni Generali. Here Emanuele Fenzi raised his grandson, the noted horticulturist Emanuele Orazio Fenzi. One of the main factors linked to the success of the Fenzi family was the ability with which they managed to expand their ties to not only Italian investors but also the different financial marketplaces in Europe as well as maintaining links with other European aristocracy. They were central players in the financing of the Suez Canal in association with 'Hans Oppenheim and Co' - founders of the 'Society General de l'Empire Ottoman. In 1867 Eugenia daughter of Sebastian Fenzi and his wife Emily VerityVerity Family Records, Glamorgan Archives D/DXcb and DXBT married Gustavus Oppenheim, and for her the Villa Oppenheim (now Hotel Villa Cora) was built. Eugenia was the last person to cross on land before the two channels of the Sueze Canal were connected. During the period when Florence was the capital of Italy the Villa Oppenheim was the political and social salon of Italy. Following the breakdown in her marriage Eugenia Fenzi lent the villa to the Empress Eugenie who later purchased it. Ouida's novel 'In a Winter City' is based on Eugenia prior to her second marriage to Count Prina Ricotti. The Fenzis' historic Seat was the Villa de Granatier, but their principal residence was their estate at Sant'Andrea in Percussina, San Casciano (altered by Giuseppe Martelli) and they later acquired the Villa di Rusciano designed by Brunallechi for the Dukes of Urbino. The Bank FlorenceCoat of Arms Established in 1821 by Emanuele Fenzi, the bank, also known as the \\"Cassa di Sconto\\", is most famous for being the first public Bank in Italy. Based in the heart of Florence in the Fenzi-Murucelli Palace on Via San Gallo. They later built the Palazzo Fenzi Piazza della Signoria designed by Giuseppi Matelli, now Assicurazioni General. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Fenzi family started to create alliances with potential business partners both local and foreign. By the 1820s the Fenzi Bank was backing the Hall family who had acquired the monopoly of the Tuscan straw hat market in England. Whilst maintaining an activity of financing public initiatives, in 1849 they became the main stockholders in the company that built the railway Leopolda. In the next thirty to forty years, the Fenzi Bank spread its network throughout Europe; by 1860, their agents were present in all the most important markets of central and northern Italy and in several cities in England, France, and Germany. They were parties to the financing of the Suez Canal. Through their network of financial activities and their willingness to invest in common financial operations with both Tuscan and international banks, the Fenzi Bank blazed the trail for the creation of large credit institutions and for a unified financial market in Tuscany in the period before the 1860 annexation to the Kingdom of Italy. The Railway Tuscany It was in 1826 that marquis Leopoldo Carl Ginori first introduced the government to the iron track. The creation and innovation of the northern railways soon became a project that was dear to all members of the Italian government. When in the early 1830s the Italian government was to sort out a financial partner for the project the Fenzi Bank entered the competition. The final decision was reached in 1835. There was to be the creation of a Railway between Florence and the coastal port of Livorno via Pisa and was to be named Leopolda after the then Grand duke. In 1837 count Luigi Serristori and the engineer Piero Dini Castelli proposed a study for the Railway. However the Fenzi project had been accepted as more serious and bitterly planned. An agreement was set up between the government the Fenzi bank, a local contractor company and British engineer Peter Senn & C. of Livorno disciple of George Stephenson and his son Robert Stephenson. The opening date for the Railway line works was set for the 14 April 1838. The line was eventually inaugurated in 1844. After nearly 20 years of planning and creation upset by the unstable political situation of the Risorgimento, the first section of the Leopolda Railway was at last finished.

The bank was established on 1 June 1974 but traces its origins to the currency board established in 1919. The bank carries out the independent monetary policy and supervision of the financial sector of The Bahamas.  History  =Currency Board= In 1919, the British Government established the Board of Commissioners of Currency to issue local Bahamian currency pegged to the pound sterling. The Board helped promote the Bahamas' emergence as an international currency trading and banking center during the 1960s and 70s. By December 1967, there were 208 banks and trust companies in the Bahamas, up from only 37 in 1963. By 1974, there were 323. However, the legislative framework was inadequate to provide for the proper regulation and supervision of banking activities. =Monetary Authority= In 1968, the Bahamas Monetary Authority (BMA) was created in the board's place. The government also subsequently ended the Bahamian dollar's pegging to the pound and pegged it instead to the US dollar. The Authority had an expanded role in the financial system of the Bahamas. First, the BMA operated under a centralized system, under which it would buy and sell foreign exchange. This allowed banks to place their foreign reserves under the control of the BMA, effectively eliminating their foreign exchange risk. Second, the BMA was authorized to purchase Bahamian government debt marking the beginning of a discretionary monetary policy. Finally, the BMA was authorized to serve as a lender of last resort to the commercial banks in the event of a financial emergency. The BMA was, however, short-lived and was replaced in 1974 by the Central Bank of The Bahamas. =Central Bank= The Central Bank was established on 1 June 1974 by The Central Bank of The Bahamas Act. now superseded by the Central Bank of The Bahamas Act, 2000. The new bank's mandate included: * the power to promote and maintain monetary stability and credit and balance of payments conditions conducive to the orderly development of the Bahamian economy; * to promote and maintain adequate banking services and high standards of conduct and bank management; * to advise the Minister of Finance, on request, on any financial or monetary matter. In addition, the Central Bank is the sole issuer of notes and coins, it acts as a banker and adviser to the Government, and manages the Government's debt. It is also a banker and lender of last resort to the commercial banks. The Bahamas is a member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), allowing it to apply exchange control to capital account transactions, foreign equity investments, direct foreign investment, and other inward and outward flows of money.  Responsibilities  The responsibilities of the Central Bank are to foster an environment of monetary stability conducive to economic development and to ensure a stable and sound financial system. It achieves this goal by: * performing the traditional roles of issuing legal tender; * maintaining external value of the Bahamian dollar; * promoting monetary stability and a sound financial structure; * acting as a banker and advisor to the government; * compiling financial statistics.  Leadership  = Governors = The current Governor of the Central Bank is John A Rolle, who has held the position since January 2016. Previous Governors include: * Mrs. Wendy M.

Wall (March 4, 1919, Portland, Oregon – February 2, 2007) was a merchant seaman and an American labor leader. He was president of the National Maritime Union (or NMU, now part of the Seafarers International Union of North America) from 1973 to 1990. His father and mother ran a small dry cleaning company.Nelson, \\"Shannon J. Wall, 87; Won Veterans Status for WWII Merchant Seamen,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 13, 2007. He joined the United States Merchant Marine and became a merchant seaman. He joined the NMU shortly thereafter. When the Merchant Marine was incorporated into the U.S. armed forces during World War II, he became a boatswain and served in the Pacific on both freight and troop carriers. In 1951, he was appointed a staff representative (or \\"port patrolman\\") for a union local in San Francisco, California, roaming the port and talking to workers to ensure the union's contract was being honored. He became a staff representative in San Pedro, California, in 1954. As he rose within the union's ranks, he moved to New Jersey to represent the union in East Coast shipping matters. Wall was elected the national union's vice president in 1958, and served three two-year terms. In 1964, he was elected the national union's secretary-treasurer.\\"Former Maritime Union President Dies at 87,\\" Associated Press, February 13, 2007. Presidency of NMU Wall was elected interim president of the NMU on March 5, 1973. He was only the second president in the union's history. Incumbent president Joseph Curran had been accused of financial improprieties. Wall was formally elected president on June 12, 1973. During Wall's presidency, the NMU shed nearly half its membership. The increasing use of flags of convenience cut deeply into the number of American merchant seamen. The use of much larger ships (reducing the number of transports needed to move the same amount of goods) and technological innovation (reducing the number of seamen needed to man a ship) also led to significant reductions in eligible members. Wall was a strong proponent of mergers between various maritime unions, and the organizing of an international union to cover all maritime workers. Throughout the 1970s, Wall was a strong voice in the debate over national energy policy. He pushed for at least 20 percent of imported oil to be carried on ships flying the American flag, lobbied against the sale of Alaskan oil to Japan, and demanded that liquefied natural gas be carried on ships and not pipelines from Alaska to continental U.S. ports. In 1975, a dissident NMU member was awarded $333,500 damages in suit filed against Curran, Wall and another NMU officer. The suit alleged that Wall and the others had maliciously prosecuted the member after he had criticized the NMU leadership. In 1978, Wall won a new contract with Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico shippers which hiked wages 32 percent over a three-year period. Although Wall had been an early endorser of Jimmy Carter as president, his union broke with the AFL-CIO to endorse Ronald Reagan.Prochnau, \\"Reagan Endorsement Flouts Union Chief,\\" Washington Post, October 11, 1980. Wall was re-elected for a fourth term as president in 1983 after a bitterly contested campaign. Wall received 9,958 votes and his opponent, Kirby-Smith McDowell, had 4,140 votes. Although no investigation by the United States Department of Labor was undertaken, Senator William V. Roth Jr. (R-Delaware) argued that significant violations of federal labor law had taken place in the election.\\"Maritime Chief Is Re-Elected,\\" New York Times, October 19, 1983; Noble, \\"Report to Senators Faults U.S. Inquiry on Maritime Union Vote,\\" New York Times, November 4, 1986. =Mergers= In 1988, Wall helped craft a merger between the NMU and the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association. After the merger, Wall became chair of the unlicensed seamen's division of District 1, and an MEBA executive vice president. At the time of the merger, NMU had 30,000 members—which included about 14,000 members working in commissaries, dining facilities and other units in U.S. naval military bases overseas. The merger did not last. MEBA members charged that the merger referendum was rigged by MEBA president by C.E. \\"Gene\\" DeFries. The accusations were so serious that the United States Department of Justice began an investigation. Union members were even more outraged when they learned DeFries and five other union officers paid themselves more than $2 million in severance payments.\\"Maritime Union Officials Convicted on Racketeering Charges,\\" press release, U.S. Dept. of Justice.

NMU disaffiliated from the Marine Engineers in 1993. Louis Parise was elected the newly independent union's president. In 1999, NMU became an autonomous affiliate of the Seafarers International Union of North America, and 2001 fully merged with that union.\\"SIU-A&G; and NMU Set Merger Vote,\\" West Coast Sailors, April 20, 2001. =Legal and legislative achievement= Roughly 250,000 merchant seamen served (many under combat conditions) during World War II. The Merchant Marine service suffered the highest casualty rate of any service during the war. However, they were not recognized as military veterans and were not able to obtain veteran's benefits or health care.Pro, \\"Unsung Heroes of World War II...,\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 30, 2004.Butler, Sailing on Friday: The Perilous Voyage of America's Merchant Marine, 1997; Herbert, The Forgotten Heroes: The Heroic Story of the United States Merchant Marine, 2004. In 1987, Wall and others sued the federal government to win designation as veterans for merchant seamen who served from December 7, 1941, to December 15, 1945. A federal district court, ruling in Schumacher v. Aldridge, 665 F. Supp. 41 (1987), agreed. Even after his retirement, Wall continued to press for legislative recognition of the contributions of merchant seamen during World War II. On October 14, 1998, President Bill Clinton signed the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-258), which extended to December 31, 1946, the cut-off under which merchant marines would still be considered veterans of World War II (making the date the same as for other branches of the military). Wall also won a legislative battle to have the United States collect federal taxes on foreign-flagged cruise ship companies. The law was changed by Congress in 1986 to give the Internal Revenue Service the authority to collect the taxes. Retirement and death Wall retired from the merged MEBA-NMU union in 1990. In February 1991, Wall became president of a new group, the International Organization of Professional Seamen. Wall formed the group to organize workers aboard U.S.-owned vessels flying under a foreign flag of convenience. However, the Seafarers International Union and International Longshoremen's Association both vehemently opposed the group, as its jurisdiction would conflict with their own.Vail, \\"Union Plan for Crews on U.S.-Owned, Foreign-Flag Ships Runs Aground,\\" Journal of Commerce, February 20, 1991. The collapse of the unionization effort led Wall to retire from union life. Wall died of natural causes at his home in Sequim, Washington, on February 2, 2007. Wall and his wife, Lucy, had two sons and a daughter. Other roles During his long career, Wall served on several boards and commissions. For many years, he was the chair of the AFL-CIO's Maritime Committee, which acts as a lobbying organization for most AFL-CIO-affiliated maritime unions. In 1982, Republican Party chairman Richard Richards appointed Wall to a labor advisory committee aimed at building Republican Party ties to union members. In 1986, President Reagan appointed Wall was appointed to the President's Commission on Merchant Marine and Defense. As part of the commission, he helped write four reports which heavily criticized the reduction in the size of the U.S. merchant navy and advocated for wide-ranging changes in U.S. maritime and defense law.

Early life and family  Abdoh was born in Tehran in 1963, the first child of Ali Abdoh, a prominent athlete, businessman and founder of the Persepolis Football Club, and Homa Mohajerin. His paternal grandfather was Mohammad Abdoh Boroujerdi, a chief justice and expert in Islamic law in the Reza Shah era. Abdoh had two brothers, Sardar \\"Sid\\" Abdoh and Salar Abdoh, and one sister, Negar. He had one half-sister from his father's previous marriage to an American woman. On his mother's side, he was first cousins once removed with Dara Khosrowshahi. In 1977 Reza was sent to England where he attended day school in London while living with his grandmother. In 1978, he was sent to Wellington, an exclusive boarding school in Somerset, England. In the wake of the Iranian Revolution, Ali Abdoh traveled to California with his four children and settled in West Covina, California. Reza's father, who had plans to open a hotel in Iran on the eve of the revolution, faced financial ruin. In the Fall, Reza began classes at University of Southern California where he completed one semester. In January 1980, Ali Abdoh died of a heart attack on a squash court at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. It is said that he died not long after discovering that Reza was gay. Career In 1983 Abdoh began directing plays, often adapting classics like King Lear, King Oedipus, and Medea in Los Angeles theaters. In 1990, Abdoh directed Father Was a Peculiar Man, a multimedia performance produced by En Garde Arts featuring more than 50 performers that occurred across four blocks of New York City's Meatpacking District. That year he also wrote and directed The Hip-Hop Waltz of Eurydice, staged at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. Abdoh called it a \\"gut reaction to systemic repression and erosion of freedom\\" in an interview with Thomas Leabhart published in Mime Journal. His work often confronted such issues as race, class and, the AIDS crisis. Abdoh worked on several productions with the New York City and Los Angeles theater ensemble Dar a Luz, which he formed in 1991. Productions with the company included The Law of Remains (1992), Tight Right White (1993) and Quotations From a Ruined City (1994), co-written with his brother, Salar Abdoh. His later work was called \\"nightmarish\\" and used multimedia elements with downtown theater conventions to \\"bombard\\" audiences. New York Times critic Stephen Holden called Abdoh \\"a theatrical visionary\\" in his obituary. Abdoh was known for his use of video in his sets, and he also created several videos between 1986 and 1991. In 1992 Abdoh wrote and directed the feature-length film The Blind Owl.  Death  Abdoh died due to causes related to AIDS on May 11, 1995.  Legacy  He is the subject of the book Reza Abdoh, edited by Daniel Mufson; his papers and videotapes of some performances are kept at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Reza Abdoh: Theatre Visionary, a documentary film about Abdoh and his work, was completed by director Adam Soch in 2016. In 2018, MoMA PS1 hosted a retrospective exhibition titled Reza Abdoh curated by Negar Azimi, Tiffany Malakooti, and Babak Radboy of Bidoun with Klaus Biesenbach.Cermatori, Joseph. \\"Reza Abdoh Today: Posthumous Reflections Fifty-Five Years after His Birth.\\" PAJ: A Journal of Performance and Art, vol. 40 no. 3, 2018, pp. 1-15.

The film was selected as the Icelandic entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 61st Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences In the Shadow of the Raven is the second film of the Raven Trilogy (also known as the Viking Trilogy) that consists of three 'Viking' films: * 1) When the Raven Flies (1984) - (original Icelandic title: Hrafninn flýgur) - usually known as simply The Raven or Revenge of the Barbarians. * 2) In The Shadow of the Raven (1987) - (original Icelandic title: Í skugga hrafnsins). * 3) Embla (2007) - (original Icelandic title: Hvíti víkingurinn) - the directors cut of The White Viking. Plot summary The film is a loose re-telling of the legend of Tristan and Isolde. In the year 1077, Trausti returns to Iceland after having studied theology in Norway. Meanwhile, Grim, the foreman on Trausti's farm, discovers a stranded whale. However, the retainers of the cruel neighbouring chief Eirikur discovers the whale as well. As Grim brings Trausti's mother Edda, the chief of the area, they discover Eirikur attempting to steal the whale. A fight erupts between the different clans and Edda is killed in the struggle. Grim kills Eirikur in revenge, and a blood-feud between Trausti's clan and Eirikur's clan is imminent.

Critical response In 1991, the Washington Post published a positive review of the film, critic Jeanne Cooper noting Hrafn Gunnlaugsson reaches gripping heights. The reviewer noted that the character of the bishop came off as similar to Jabba the Hutt and that Trausti's survival ability came off a Rasputin-like, but noted that this did not distract from the film.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/shadowoftheravennrcooper_a09ed2.htm New York Times wrote in their own review the same year that \\"In the world of Hrafn Gunnlaugsson's medieval adventure film, The Shadow of the Raven, emotions are as jagged and windblown as the spectacular Icelandic coastline where the movie was shot\\". Critic Stephen Holden praised the performances of Tinna Gunnlaugsdóttir and Kristbjörg Kjeld, but panned Reine Brynolfsson as unconvincing. Holden described Sune Mang's performance as \\"glowering exuberance\\", but was critical to some of dialog delivery of the cast members, calling it \\"grunting\\".https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CE2DF1E39F930A25754C0A967958260 Connections to The Raven Flies Though not a conventional sequel at first sight, the film does feature several nods to the original film. The farm Króss is shot at the very same location as Thord's farm in the original film. When Trauti opens up his father's tomb, it's the very same clifftomb featured in The Raven Flies and the father's old helmet and cape and idols of Odin and Thor are the same as in the original film. Also, Gest's throwing knives are also found in the tomb. This heavily suggest that Trausti is the descendant of Thord and Einar.

In Argentina it's also known as Lo que buscas es amor. The executive producer was Marcelo Schapces, and it was produced by Sandra Gugliotta and Fernando Merinero.Un día de suerte IMDb. It stars Valentina Bassi as Elsa. The theme of this docudrama is the economic turmoil and unemployment among the young population during the Argentinian economic crisis (1999-2002). The film won two awards at the Berlin International Film Festival, winning also the Caligari Film Award and the Don Quixote Award. Plot In 2000, Elsa (Valentina Bassi), a 25-year-old woman who barely makes a living as a promotional girl on the streets in Buenos Aires, commits minor crimes, like stealing from her boss' wallet, in order to survive. As a promotional girl, she does what can be considered humiliating work: handing out flyers for \\"anti-stress\\" tablets for motorists and pedestrians, dressing up in odd outfits for fast-food restaurants, and the like. During the film, protests take place in the streets of Buenos Aires but Elsa ignores them. Included are documentary-like scenes of the 2001 riots that seem shot by a hand-held camera. She dreams of fleeing her impoverished country and traveling to Italy where a former \\"boyfriend\\", whom she had a one-night stand with several months before, left for better opportunities. This is ironic because her anarchist grandfather (Darío Víttori) left Italy and came to Argentina to escape poverty (he still has anti-establishment views) years ago. Her boyfriend Walter (Fernán Mirás) protests the trip, yet, her grandfather urges her to follow her heart. Her dream is mostly a fantasy she has in order to ameliorate the stress of surviving during Argentina's economic troubles.

The poverty rate of Argentina grew from an already high 35.9% in May 2001 to a peak of 57.5% in October 2002. In addition, the May 2000 unemployment rate was 15.4%; it climbed to 18.3% in December 2001. Un día de suerte was shot in Buenos Aires during the riots of 2000 when political unrest was at its highest. Blackouts were also a common occurrence and street crimes occurred often.Norton-Smith, Clare. BBC, film review, November 12, 2005. Distribution The film was first featured at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 22, 2002. It opened in Argentina on April 25, 2002. It was screened at various film festivals, including: the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema; the Sydney Film Festival, Australia; the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, Czech Republic; the Toronto International Film Festival, Canada; the AFI Film Festival, United States; the Angers Film Festival, France; and others. Critical reception Clare Norton-Smith, writing for the BBC, liked how the characters were developed by Sandra Gugliotta, and wrote, \\"Although Elsa endures grim circumstances and resorts to desperate measures, the spirit of conviction and a belief in oneself, make this ultimately a warm, life- affirming film. As Gugliotta says, her film 'speaks of dreams, of the possibility and the struggle to fulfill a dream. And it also speaks of good people, of social barriers, and of roots.'\\"Norton-Smith, Clare. Ibid. Some critics felt the film's theme, that is, economic deprivation, did not go far enough. David Walsh, writing for the World Socialist web site wrote, \\"Again, without being given some sense of the historical circumstances which account for the present state of mind, one cannot go very far. The film lacks the 'pathos of distance.' A Lucky Day raises interesting questions, but does not go terribly deeply into them. The scenes of the working class kids strike one as a bit false and stereotyped, a middle class notion of what such young people are like.\\"Walsh, David.

The screenplay by E.Y. Harburg and Fred Saidy is based on their 1947 stage musical of the same name. An international co-production of Ireland and the United States, the film follows an Irishman and his daughter who steal a leprechaun's magic pot of gold and emigrate to the U.S., where they become involved in a dispute between rural landowners and a greedy, racist U.S. senator. The film was nominated for several Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and a Writers Guild of America Award. Plot A lovable rogue named Finian McLonergan absconds from his native Ireland with a pot of gold secreted in a carpetbag, plus his daughter Sharon in tow. His destination is Rainbow Valley in the (fictional) state of Missitucky, where he plans to bury his treasure in the mistaken belief that, given its proximity to Fort Knox, it will multiply. Hot on his heels is the leprechaun Og, desperate to recover his stolen crock before he turns human. Among those involved in the ensuing shenanigans are Woody Mahoney, a ne'er-do- well dreamer who woos Sharon; his mute sister Susan, who expresses herself in dance; Woody's good friend and business partner Howard, an African-American botanist determined to grow mentholated tobacco; and bombastic Senator Billboard Rawkins, who wears his bigotry as if it were a badge of honor. Complications arise when Rawkins, believing there is gold in Rainbow Valley, attempts to seize the land from the people who live there and makes some racial slurs while doing so. Sharon furiously wishes he would turn black himself--and, because she is in close proximity to the magical pot of gold, which is capable of granting three wishes, Rawkins does exactly that. Rawkins' dog, who has been trained to attack black people, chases him off into the woods. Later, the sheriff returns with the district attorney, who threatens to charge Sharon with witchcraft unless Rawkins is produced. Rawkins runs into Og in the woods and tells him that a witch changed him from a white man to black. Seeing that the change of skin color did nothing to alter his hateful racism, Og casts a spell to make Rawkins more open-minded. The townspeople gather in the barn for the wedding of Sharon and Woody, but the sheriff, his deputies, and the district attorney interrupt the ceremony and arrest Sharon for witchcraft. Finian convinces them that Sharon can change Rawkins back to white overnight, and they lock Sharon and Woody in the barn until daybreak. To save his daughter, Finian tries to find the pot of gold, unaware that Susan has discovered it and hidden it under a bridge. Og meets with Susan on the bridge under which the gold is hidden and wishes she could talk. When she begins to speak, Og realizes they are standing above the gold. As the district attorney sets the barn on fire with Sharon and Woody locked inside, Og considers using the pot's final wish to retain his leprechaun status and return to the fairy world. After a passionate kiss, he decides he would rather remain human with Susan and wishes for Rawkins to be white once more. Sharon and Woody are released from the burning barn, and thanks to the now-empty crock helping to put out the fire, Howard's mentholated tobacco experiments become successful, ensuring financial success for all the poor people of Rainbow Valley, both white and black. Sharon and Woody are wed, and bid a fond farewell to Finian, who leaves Rainbow Valley in search of his own rainbow. Cast Production =Development= Since the musical was such a success on stage, there had always been interest in filming it. MGM was interested in filming it in 1948 as a vehicle for Mickey Rooney. However, Harburg set the price for the rights at $1 million and wanted creative control. For a time, a German company wanted to make it. In 1954, the Distributors Corporation of America wanted to make it as an animated film. A soundtrack of the score was recorded by several stars, but the film was not completed. In 1958, the authors of the musical teamed with Sidney Buchman to produce the film independently but the film did not proceed. In 1960, the rights were held by Marvin Rothenberg who wanted Michael Gordon to direct and Debbie Reynolds to star. It was announced the film would be budgeted at $2 million and be released by United Artists. However the film did not eventuate. Harburg stated in 1960 that he was told part of the reason it was so difficult to get a film version made was Hollywood was scared of fantasy musicals. Another reason was the McCarthyism of the period. In 1965, Harold Hecht bought the film rights and hired Harburg and Saidy to write a script and some new songs. Hecht said he intended to film in nine months. \\"This time we really mean business\\", said Harburg. \\"We've gotten a substantial deal and participation in money and production. Up until now Finian has been making so much money on the road that we didn't want to kill the goose laying all those golden eggs. But you become more idealistic as you grow older and you tend to stop thinking about yourself.\\" =Warner Bros.= In September 1966 Warner Bros. announced it had the rights and would make a film produced by Joseph Landon and starring Fred Astaire, with the aim to get Tommy Steele as the leprechaun. The budget was expected to be $4 million. Francis Ford Coppola was signed as director in February 1967. Petula Clark then came on board as the female lead and Steele confirmed as the leprechaun, although Robert Morse had expressed interest. Warner Bros. had optioned the film rights to the stage musical, and the rights were on the verge of expiring. With Camelot having proven to be more costly than anticipated, and its commercial success still undetermined because it had not been released, Jack L. Warner was having second thoughts about another musical project, but when he saw Petula Clark perform on her opening night at the Coconut Grove in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, he knew he had found the ideal Sharon.Finian's Rainbow Original Soundtrack CD liner notes He decided to forge ahead and hoped for the best despite his misgivings about having nearly-novice \\"hippie\\" director Francis Ford Coppola at its helm. Although Clark had made many films in the 1940s and 1950s in her native Great Britain, this was her first starring role in 10 years, and her first film appearance since rising to international fame with \\"Downtown\\" four years earlier. It was known that Dick Van Dyke was considered to play the role of Finian, back in 1965; however, financial problems caused the filming to be postponed, and Van Dyke dropped out of consideration. (Source: \\"The Films of Fred Astaire\\") Fred Astaire, whose last movie musical had been Silk Stockings 11 years earlier, and who had concentrated on his TV specials in the interim, was persuaded at the age of 69 to return to the screen to portray the title character. Given his status as a screen legend and to accommodate his talents, the role was given a musical presence it had not had on stage, and he was given top billing rather than the original third billing. While a construction crew transformed more than nine acres of back lot into Rainbow Valley, complete with a narrow gauge railway, schoolhouse, general store, post office, houses, and barns, Coppola spent five weeks rehearsing the cast, and before principal photography began, a complete performance of the film was presented to an audience on a studio sound stage. In the liner notes she wrote for the 2004 Rhino Records limited, numbered edition CD release of the soundtrack, Clark recalls that old-Hollywood Astaire was befuddled by Coppola's contemporary methods of film-making and balked at dancing in \\"a real field with cow dung and rabbit holes.\\" Although he acquiesced to filming a sequence in the Napa Valley near Coppola's home, the bulk of the movie was shot on studio sound stages and the back lot, leaving the finished film with jarring contrasts between reality and make-believe. Clark was nervous about her first Hollywood movie and particularly concerned about dancing with old pro Astaire. He later confessed he was just as worried about singing with her. The film was partially choreographed by Astaire's long-time friend and collaborator Hermes Pan, who was fired by Coppola during filming.DVDJournal.com Finian's Rainbow proved to be Astaire's last major movie musical, although he went on to dance with Gene Kelly during the linking sections of That's Entertainment, Part 2. Clark recalls that Coppola's approach was at odds with the subject matter. \\"Francis...wanted to make it more real. The problem with Finian's Rainbow is that it's sort of like a fairy tale...so trying to make sense of it was a very delicate thing.\\" Coppola opted to fall somewhere in the middle, with mixed results. Updating the story line was limited to changing Woody from a labor organizer to the manager of a sharecroppers' cooperative, making college- student Howard a research botanist, and a few minor changes to the lyrics in the Burton Lane–E.Y. Harburg score, such as changing a reference to Carmen Miranda to Zsa Zsa Gabor. Other than that, the plot remains entrenched in an era that predates the Civil Rights Movement. Because preview audiences found the film overly long, the musical number \\"Necessity\\" was deleted before its release, although the song remains on the soundtrack album. It can be heard as background music when Senator Rawkins first shows up in Rainbow Valley in his attempt to buy Finian out. In August 2012, Clark told the BBC Radio 4 show The Reunion that she and her fellow cast members smoked marijuana during the filming of the movie. \\"There was a lot of Flower Power going on\\", she said.

Critical reception Released in major cities as a roadshow presentation complete with intermission, at a time when the popularity of movie musicals was on the wane, the film was dismissed as inconsequential by many critics, who found Astaire's obviously frail and aged appearance shocking and Steele's manic performance annoying. In the New York Times, Renata Adler described it as a \\"cheesy, joyless thing\\" and added \\"there is something awfully depressing about seeing Finian's Rainbow...with Fred Astaire looking ancient, far beyond his years, collapsed and red-eyed...it is not just that the musical is dated...it is that it has been done listlessly and even tastelessly.\\"York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, on the other hand, thought it was \\"the best of the recent roadshow musicals...Since The Sound of Music, musicals have been...long, expensive, weighed down with unnecessary production values and filled with pretension...Finian's Rainbow is an exception...it knows exactly where it's going, and is getting there as quickly and with as much fun as possible...it is the best-directed musical since West Side Story. It is also enchanting, and that's a word I don't get to use much...it is so good, I suspect, because Astaire was willing to play it as the screenplay demands...he...created this warm old man...and played him wrinkles and all. Astaire is pushing 70, after all, and no effort was made to make him look younger with common tricks of lighting, makeup and photography. That would have been unnecessary: He has a natural youthfulness. I particularly want to make this point because of the cruel remarks on Astaire's appearance in the New York Times review by Renata Adler. She is mistaken.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review Time Out London calls it an \\"underrated musical...the best of the latter-day musicals in the tradition of Minnelli and MGM.\\" Highly praised by all was Petula Clark, whom Ebert described as \\"a surprise. I knew she could sing, but I didn't expect much more. She is a fresh addition to the movies: a handsome profile, a bright personality, and a singing voice as unique in its own way as Streisand's.\\" John Mahoney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Clark \\"invites no comparisons, bringing to her interpretation of Sharon her own distinctive freshness and form of delivery.\\" In the New York Daily News, Wanda Hale cited her \\"winsome charm which comes through despite a somewhat reactive role.\\" Joseph Morgenstern of Newsweek wrote that she \\"looks lovely\\" and \\"sings beautifully, with an occasional startling reference to the phrasing and timbre of Ella Logan's original performance.\\" Variety observed \\"Miss Clark gives a good performance and she sings the beautiful songs like a nightingale.\\" Clearly, in the United States at least, Clark was known only as a singer, although she had appeared as an actress in British films since she was a child. In its first two months, the film earned $5.1 million in rentals in North America,\\"Big Rental Films of 1969\\", Variety, 7 January 1970 p 15 ending its worldwide run with $11.6 million. The Coen brothers have expressed that the film is among their favorite films: \\"I remember when we worked with Nicolas Cage on Raising Arizona, we talked about his uncle, Francis Ford Coppola, and told him that Finian's Rainbow, which hardly anyone has ever seen, was one of our favorite films. He told his uncle, who I think has considered us deranged ever since.\\" Awards and honors The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy but lost to Oliver!

It is bounded on the northwest by the East Pacific Rise, on the southwest by the Rivera Transform Fault, on the southeast by a deformation zone, and on the northeast by the Middle America Trench and another deformation zone. The Rivera Plate is believed to have separated from the Cocos Plate located to its southeast about 5–10 million years ago. Seismicity and tomography images show that the Rivera plate dips at 40° beneath the forearc region and then dips ~70° beneath the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The subduction of the Rivera Plate under the North American Plate, in the Mid-American Trench, has been the cause of the strongest earthquakes in the history of Mexico, including the largest earthquake in Mexico during the 20th century which occurred on June 3, 1932 in the state of Jalisco. The quake had a magnitude of 8.2 with a magnitude 7.8 aftershock, both of which caused widespread casualties and damage. On October 9, 1995, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred beneath the Jalisco region and caused significant loss of life and property.

He is the co-founder and co-owner of Self Core Records and the founder of the turntablist collective 1200 Hobos. He has also appeared on numerous underground hip hop records as DJ or producer, as well as releasing a number of solo records. Early life Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Forste was introduced to DJing around 1985, when he saw Grandmaster Flash performing on the syndicated light news/entertainment show PM Magazine, but \\"didn't really understand what he did.\\" After watching an MTV broadcast of Grand Mixer DXT performing with Herbie Hancock on the latter's 1983 single \\"Rockit,\\" he learned the hand motions and began to learn scratching himself. He estimates that he spent six months \\"getting the hang of\\" scratching, subsequently spending two years \\"cutting and scratching to whatever was on TV\\" to practice. Career Mr. Dibbs formed his own turntablist crew 1200 Hobos in the early 1990s. The crew's rotating line-up has included Doseone, Jel, Buck 65, Sixtoo, Adverse, DJ Signify, DJ Mayonnaise, DJ Skip among others, and at its largest numbered 23 members. They have released two mixtapes. In addition to 1200 Hobos, Mr. Dibbs has also been touring DJ for Atmosphere and El-P. With Doseone and Jel, he is also a member of Presage, who released one album Outer Perimeter in 1998. In 1996, Mr. Dibbs teamed up with graffiti magazine Scribble to put on the first Scribble Jam event as a promotion for the magazine's launch. The event has since become America's largest hip hop festival with separate competitions for rapping, DJing, graffiti, b-boying and beatboxing. Its past participants and guests have included Juice, Eminem, Adeem, P.E.A.C.E., Eyedea, Sage Francis, Mac Lethal, Rhymefest, Nocando, Skratch Bastid and DJ Abilities. Mr. Dibbs' Turntable Hardcore series of albums was notable for its genre-straddling approach, blending a wide variety of styles along with more usual hip hop turntablism.

Like sedums, Rhodiola species are often called stonecrops. Some authors merge Rhodiola into Sedum. Rhodiola species grow in high-altitude and other cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Den virtuella floran gives the number of species as 36, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website gives it as 90, and the Flora of China gives it as about 90, with 55 in China and 16 endemic there. Flora of North America lists only three species in the United States and Canada.  Description  Among the distinguishing characters of the genus are two series of stamens totaling twice the number of petals; free or nearly free petals (not joined in a tube); a stout rhizome from whose axils the flowering stems rise; and a basal rosette of leaves. This genus contains the only species of Crassulaceae that have unisexual flowers. = Phytochemistry = Rhodionin is a herbacetin rhamnoside found in Rhodiola species. *Rhodiolin [86831-53-0] *Rhodiolgin [94696-39-6]  Taxonomy  Although Linnaeus distinguished Rhodiola from Sedum on the basis of being dioecious, it was later submerged in the latter genus until the twentieth century, when it was restored, on the basis of well developed rhizomes and annual flowering stems, arising from axils of the scaly radical leaves. This separation was subsequently confirmed by molecular phylogenetic studies. Rhodiola is placed within family Crassulaceae, in subfamily Sempervivoideae, tribe Umbiliceae. There it is a sister group to Pseudosedum, though some authors have suggested that the latter genus be submersed within Rhodiola. = Subdivision = Traditionally Rhodiola was divided into subgenera, sections and series, based on plant characteristics. Four subgenera were recognised; Rhodiola, Primuloides, Crassipedes and Clementsia. However molecular studies have failed to demonstrate monophyly of these subtaxa. Species include: *Rhodiola integrifolia *Rhodiola rhodantha *Rhodiola rosea = Etymology = The name combines the Greek rhodon, meaning rose and referring to the rose-like smell of the roots, with the Latin diminutive suffix -iola.  Ecology  Dioecy, having separate male and female flowers, has evolved at least three times in the genus, and reversals to a hermaphrodite condition have also occurred, which is a rare occurrence in flowering plants. It has been suggested that dioecy in the genus may correlate with abiotic pollination in the cold environment.  Uses  The Holarctic species Rhodiola rosea is used in herbal medicine. A number of species are grown as ornamentals, but growing them is difficult outside their native subarctic and alpine climates.

Dedicated in 1960, the cemetery contains 7,992 American war dead and covers . One of three American war cemeteries in Belgium, along with the Ardennes American Cemetery and Flanders Field, it is administered by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC). History The majority of the fallen buried at Henri-Chapelle were killed during the Allied push in Germany during late 1944 and early 1945. The fallen from two key military engagements fill the cemetery; the First United States Army's drive through northern France, Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg into Germany in September 1944; and the Battle of the Bulge (including the Battle of Hurtgen Forest and later taking of Aachen). Following the war, the American Graves Registration Service began to repatriate the bodies of fallen personnel back to the United States. Disinterments began on 27 July 1947, and the first shipment of bodies left the Belgian port of Antwerp in October 1947. The moment was marked by a large commemoration attended by over 30,000 Belgian citizens. Layout The cemetery placed graves in arcs across gently slopes lawns, and a central road passes through the cemetery. There is a chapel and visitor's center containing carved granite maps showing the advance of U.S. forces across Belgium and into Germany. A colonnade features the names of 450 missing U.S. service personnel (rosettes next to a name highlight that that person has since been located or identified).

He also played college football for Utah State where he set multiple passing records as a senior in 1963. Drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the first round of the 1964 NFL Draft, Munson was the Rams' starting quarterback in 1964 and 1965 and a backup to Roman Gabriel in 1966 and 1967. In 1968, Munson was traded to the Detroit Lions where he remained for eight seasons (1968–1975), competing all the while for the starting quarterback position with Greg Landry. Munson concluded his career as a backup quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks (1976), San Diego Chargers (1977), and Buffalo Bills (1978–1979). In 16 NFL seasons, Munson appeared in 107 games, 66 of them as a starting quarterback. His teams compiled a 27–34–5 record in the 66 games he started. Munson completed 1,070 of 1,982 passes for 12,896 yards, 84 touchdowns, and 80 interceptions. He also accumulated 548 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns on 130 carries. Early years Munson was born in Sacramento, California, in 1941. He moved to Lodi, California, as a boy and attended Lodi High School. Munson attended Utah State University where he played college football for the Utah State Aggies football team. As senior in 1963, he led the Aggies to an 8-2 record and broke multiple school passing records, completing 120 of 201 passes (.592 completion percentage) for 1,699 yards, 12 touchdowns, and three interceptions. He was also named Utah State's athlete of the year for the 1963–64 academic year. Professional football =Los Angeles Rams= Munson was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the first round, seventh overall pick, of the 1964 NFL Draft. As a rookie in 1964, he started eight games for the Rams, leading them to a 2–4–2 record in those games. On December 14, 1964, he connected with Bucky Pope for a 95-yard touchdown against the Green Bay Packers, ranking as the longest pass play in the NFL during the 1964 season. The following year, he started the first 10 games for the Rams, compiling a 1–9 record, but missed the final four games due to a knee injury. Munson eventually lost the starting quarterback job to Roman Gabriel and saw only limited action as a backup for the Rams in 1966 and 1967. =Detroit Lions= In May 1968, Munson was traded by the Rams to the Detroit Lions along with a third round draft pick in exchange for Pat Studstill, Tom Watkins, Milt Plum, and Detroit's first round draft pick in the 1969 NFL Draft. For the next eight years, Munson competed for the Lions' starting quarterback job with Greg Landry, who the Lions had selected with their first round pick in the 1968 NFL Draft. In his first season in Detroit, Munson started 10 games for the Lions, leading them to a 4–6–2 record and completing 181 of 329 passes for a career-high 2,311 yards, 15 touchdowns and eight interceptions. His 2.4% interception percentage was the best in the NFL in 1968. In 1969, Munson shared the starting quarterback position with Landry, each of them starting seven games. Munson and Landry again shared the quarterback position for the 1970 Lions, with Munson starting eight games and Landry seven. By 1971, Landry had won the starting job, and Munson served solely in a backup role during the 1971 and 1972 seasons. In 1972, Landry and Munson returned to shared responsibilities with each starting seven games as the Lions' quarterback. Then, in 1974, Landry was injured in the final pre- season game, and Munson started 11 of 14 games for the Lions, completing 166 of 292 passes for 1,874 yards, eight touchdowns and seven interceptions. In 1975, Munson started only three games for the Lions, compiling a 1–2 record in those games. =1976 to 1979 seasons= In early September 1976, the Lions traded Munson to the Seattle Seahawks in exchange for a future draft choice. Munson spent the 1976 season as a backup for the Seahawks. He concluded his career serving as a backup for the San Diego Chargers (signed as a free agent) in 1977 and for the Buffalo Bills (traded by the Chargers) in 1978 and 1979. =Career statistics= Munson played for five NFL teams over 16 years from 1964 to 1979. He appeared in 107 games, 66 of them as a starting quarterback. His teams compiled a 27-34-5 record in the 66 games he started. Munson completed 1,070 of 1,982 passes for 12,896 yards, 84 touchdowns, and 80 interceptions. He also accumulated 548 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns on 130 carries. Later years After retiring from football, Munson lived in the Detroit area for several years, working for an automobile tooling business. He later retired and moved back to his home town of Lodi, California. Munson died in July 2000 at age 58. His body was found in the swimming pool of his home in Lodi.

Nationalist strategy During the Shangdang Campaign, communist units of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan (晋冀鲁豫) Military Region succeeded in taking control over a 200 km section of the railway from Beijing to Hankou, and the adjacent regions along this section. Their nationalist enemy were determined to dislodge the communist force from their newly gained territory and planned an offensive that would significantly boost the nationalist bargaining chips in the peace negotiation with the communist opponent. The nationalist side deployed around 145,000 troops in two echelons, and the first echelon mainly consisted of three armies from the 11th War Zone to strike northward from Xinxiang (新乡) in two fronts: the nationalist left front consisted of the Newly Organized 8th Army and the 30th Army, while the nationalist right front consisted of the 40th Army and the 9th Combat Engineering Regiment. The second echelon also consisted of two fronts: In the south, the nationalist 32nd Army of the 11th War Zone would follow the 40th Army to Anyang (安阳), and then would continue and linkup with the 3rd Army and the 16th Army of the nationalist 1st War Zone at Shijiazhuang. Once the three armies had joined their forces, they would continue push northward and linkup with the 92nd Army and 94th Army, which would strike southward from Beijing, where these two nationalist armies were previously airlifted to the ancient city. When the link up is completed, the previously communist occupied territory would be firmly back into the nationalist hands. The nationalist success of the offensive would also secure the passage to northeast China and guarantee the control of northern China. The commander of the nationalist 40th Army, Ma Fawu (马法五), was also the commander-in-chief of the 11th War Zone, while the commander of the nationalist Newly Organized 8th Army, Gao Shuxun (高树勋), was also the deputy commander-in-chief of the 11th War Zone, and they were in charge of the entire operation. Communist strategy The communists plan was to concentrate a total of 60,000 regular army troops from the 1st Column, the 2nd Column, the 3rd Column, and units of Taihang (太行) Military Region, Hebei-Shandong-Henan (Ji-Lu-Yu, 冀鲁豫) Military Region, and Southern Hebei (Ji-Nan, 冀南) Military Region to annihilate the enemy at the Fuyang (滏阳) region north the Zhang River (漳河), and south of Handan, with the help of another 100,000 communist militia. The strategy was to proceed in several phases: At the beginning, communist units of the Taihang (太行) Military Region, units of Hebei-Shandong-Henan (Ji- Lu-Yu, 冀鲁豫) Military Region and local militia would destroy railways from the north of Yellow River to Anyang, and harass the enemy to provide time for other communists to group. After the enemy has crossed the Zhang River (漳河), a detachment of the communist force would immediately control the river crossing point, and thus cutoff the link between the enemy units at Anyang and that had crossed the Zhang River (漳河). The enemy units that had crossed the Zhang River (漳河) would then be lured into the regions south of Handan and north of Zhang River (漳河) to be ambushed in the pre-selected spot. The enemy would be annihilated in a pincer movement that consisted of two fronts: the eastern front would consist of the communist 1st Column and units of Hebei-Shandong- Henan (Ji-Lu-Yu, 冀鲁豫) Military Region, while the western front would consist of the communist 2nd Column, 3rd Column, units from Taihang (太行) Military Region and Southern Hebei (Ji-Nan, 冀南) Military Region. Prelude The nationalists begun their push on October 14, 1945. However, majority of the officers and soldiers of the Newly Organized 8th Army, the most capable fighting unit of the nationalist force and thus tasked to bear the brunt of the fighting, were extremely resentful to Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime. The reason was that the troops originally belonged to Guominjun clique of warlords, but later defected to Chiang Kai-shek. Unlike many warlords who collaborated with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War and then rejoined the nationalist regime after World War II, these troops remained firmly on the Chinese side throughout the conflict. Furthermore, unlike other warlords who stayed on the Chinese side during the conflict but were not under the direct control of Chiang Kai-shek and remained independent instead, such as the case of Yan Xishan, Ma clique, New Guangxi Clique, and Sichuan clique, these troops were directly under control of Chiang Kai-shek and his regime, just like Chiang's own troops. However, these troops of former Guominjun felt that their loyalty was not rewarded accordingly and they were discriminated against by Chiang Kai-shek and troops of his own clique. Such sentiment was certainly true because Chiang Kai-shek had planned to solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long together with the eradication of the communism, which proved to be a fatal mistake. These former warlords's troops believed that Chiang Kai-shek and his regime felt that they were expandable and used them just as tools of the civil war because instead of sending his crack troops such as the Newly Organized 1st Army, Chiang Kai- shek only send the second-rate troops to fight alongside with them, and moreover, it were them who bore the brunt of the fights instead Chiang's own troops. Such resentment against Chiang Kai-shek and his regime was exploited to the maximum by their communist enemy in the latter stage of the Handan Campaign, resulting in their defection to the communist side, which proved to be a significant factor that contributed to the nationalist failure. To complete their plan, many communist agents had already infiltrated the Newly Organized 8th Army prior to the campaign. Order of battle Nationalist order of battle 1st Echelon: 7 Divisions with 45,000 troops *Newly Organized 8th Army deployed at Xinxiang *The 30th Army deployed at Xinxiang *The 40th Army deployed at Xinxiang 2nd Echelon: 100,000 troops *The 3rd Army deployed at Shijiazhuang *The 16th Army deployed at Shijiazhuang *The 32nd Army deployed at Anyang *The 92nd Army deployed at Beijing *The 94th Army deployed at Beijing Communist order of battle 60,000 regulars: *The 1st Column *The 2nd Column *The 3rd Column *Units of Taihang (太行) Military Region *Units of Hebei- Shandong-Henan (Ji-Lu-Yu, 冀鲁豫) Military Region *Units of Southern Hebei (Ji- Nan, 冀南) Military Region Another 100,000 militia First stage By October 20, 1945, the nationalist advance guards had occupied the positions at shore of Zhang River (漳河), covering the troops building the bridges at the crossing point. On October 22, 1945, the nationalist force had crossed the Zhang River (漳河), where they were met head on with the communist 1st Column deployed south of Handan, and the first shot of the campaign had been fired. By October 24, 1945, all three nationalist armies had cross the Zhang River (漳河), and under the heavy artillery bombardment, the 106th Division of the nationalist 40th Army assaulted the position of the 1st Brigade of the communist 1st Column, succeeding in breaking through after a day of fierce fighting, penetrating the communist defense at region between Cuiqu (崔曲), Jiati (夹堤), and by the evening, had successfully pushed to Village of Gao (Gozhuang, 高庄), Nanpozi (南泊子) line. Unbeknown to the nationalist force, the communist force was luring them into their trap, and northern group and the southern group had already begun to encircle the enemy from three directions: south of Handan, west of Magnetic County (Cixian, 磁县) and east of Horse Head Town (Matouzhen, 马头镇). When the nationalist force had reached the Magnetic County (Cixian, 磁县) and the Horse Head Town (Matouzhen, 马头镇), the communist encirclement was complete, while at the same time, the river crossing of Zhang River (漳河) had also fallen into the communist hands. Realizing that they were surrounded, the besieged nationalist force retreated toward North and South Zuoliang (左良) and Cuiqu (崔曲), and directly appealed to Chiang Kai-shek for help via radio. Chiang Kai- shek, in turned, ordered the entire second echelon to be mobilized to help the besieged first echelon by sending everyone available. However, the nationalist commanders of the second echelon were reluctant and more importantly, impossible to devote their force 100%, and instead, only send small detachments. On October 26, 1945, a portion of the nationalist 16th Army were sent from Shijiazhuang, but they were stopped by the communist units of the Taihang (太行) Military Region and other local militia units at Gaoyi (高邑). Meanwhile, the nationalist 32nd Army at Anyang sent out a detachment to reinforce their besieged comrade-in-arms, but this reinforcement from the south was also stopped by the communist force at Zhang River (漳河). Second stage At the dusk of October 28, 1945, the full-scale attack on the besieged nationalist force begun. The communist northern group targeted the nationalist 40th Army while avoiding direct confrontation with the nationalist Newly Organized 8th Army. By October 30, 1945, the 106th Division of the nationalist 40th Army was nearly wiped out, and the nationalist 30th Army was also badly mauled. Meanwhile, the communist chief of staff Li Da (李达) personally went to the headquarters of the nationalist Newly Organized 8th Army and successfully convinced its commander, the deputy commander-in-chief of the 11th War Zone, Gao Shuxun (高树勋) to defect to the communist side. The defection of the most capable fighting unit of the nationalist force struck a devastating blow on the nationalist morale and worsened the situation for the remaining besieged nationalist units. Sensing the opportunity, the communist commander Liu Bocheng ordered the communist 1st Column and 3rd Column to open up the southern front and set a new trap along the road to lure out the besieged nationalist units from their strongholds. On October 31, 1945, the nationalist force escaped thru the opening in the south exactly as their communist enemy had expected, and was besieged at regions along the Flagpole Zhang (Qigan Zhang, 旗杆漳), Xin Village (Xin Zhuang, 辛庄), and Horse Camp (Ma Ying, 马营) line when the communist units of the Taihang (太行) Military Region and units of Hebei-Shandong-Henan (Ji-Lu-Yu, 冀鲁豫) Military Region stopped them at the northern shore of Zhang River (漳河). On November 1, 1945, a detachment of the communist 1st Column had taken the headquarters of the nationalist 40th Army at Flagpole Zhang (Qigan Zhang, 旗杆漳), capturing the nationalist commander-in- chief Ma Fawu (马法五) alive and the nationalist resistance ceased completely by the next day, while the nationalist reinforcement on the road immediately withdraw back to their fortified positions behind the city walls upon hearing the new. The campaign ended on the November 2, 1945. Outcome The communist victory of Handan Campaign was another heavy blow to the nationalist after Shangdang Campaign, and strengthened the communist position in the peace negotiation. Furthermore, the communist victory had significantly slowed the nationalist deployment along the railway from Beijing to Hankou and thus provided cover for other communist forces to proceed to northeast China. The most obvious nationalist debacle was Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long together with the eradication of the communism by reducing the warlords' power via reducing their military strength, which proved to be a fatal mistake, resulting in nationalist units defecting to the communist side. However, even Chiang's communist adversary had admitted that Chiang could not and should not be excessively blamed for this because nobody else could do any better, including the communists themselves, had their positions being switched with that of Chiang and his nationalist regime, because Chiang Kai-shek was faced with a huge dilemma: for these troops, the only way to survive was to serve in the armed forces, and if these warlords' troops were not expanded in battles but discharged in peacetime demilitarization, they would be forced to join the communist camp for survival anyway when they were out of jobs, as later proved in places such as northeast China. When these experienced combat veterans with experience with modern weaponry joined the communist force that was mostly illiterate peasantry army, the combat capability of the communist force would be and had been significantly boosted, and obviously anyone would rather want them perished in fights against the enemy instead of helping the enemy when these troops were to be demilitarized, and Chiang Kai-shek was no exception. Even if Chiang Kai-shek had not made the fatal mistake of attempting to solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long together with the eradication of the communism, the nationalist offensive was destined to fail from the very beginning because Chiang and his nationalist regime had made an even greater fatal mistake: launching an offensive too early with insufficient strength. As Chiang had soon painfully realized, the nationalist regime simply did not have enough resource to deploy its troops in very short time span in the vast regions of China. When the surrounding countryside was dominated by the opposing communist force, launching an offensive of the scale of Handan Campaign with what was currently available for the nationalist side was simply unrealistically overambitious. Even Chiang Kai-shek's communist adversary did not blame on the nationalist second echelon for not succeeding in rescue their besieged comrade-in-arms, because they were too far away, and in fact, the reinforcement sent by the nationalist 92nd Army and the 94th Army from Beijing did not even meet any enemy before they were turned back due to the end of the campaign, achieving nothing except wasting valuable supply. These nationalist commanders were loyal officers of troops of Chiang Kai-shek's own clique and thus even their communist enemy did not accuse them of being warlords' troops who were reluctant to carry out Chiang's order. In fact, these commanders of the nationalist second echelon made a correct decision in only sending out detachments for reinforcement instead of everyone as they were ordered because they were already dangerously overstretched in regions surrounded by the enemy from countryside, and if everyone was sent out as ordered, then not only the urban centers would risk being taken over by the enemy due to the undermanned defense, those on the road would also risk being annihilated, not mentioning the fact that the great distance would mean the reinforcement would never be able to reach its destination in time. Therefore, the correct decision made by the commanders of the nationalist second echelon had succeeded in preserve the nationalist force of the second echelon, which was almost unscratched. The successful preservation of the force, in turn, would help the nationalist regime later to buy time for troop deployment and strengthening the nationalist positions.

It is based on two waiting lists, the first one is called foreground because this is the one in which all processes initially enter, and the second one is called background because all processes, after using all of their execution time in foreground, are moved to background. When a process becomes ready it begins its execution in foreground immediately, forcing the processor to give up execution of the current process in the background and execute the newly created process for a predefined period. This period is usually 2 or more quanta. If the process is not finished after its execution in the foreground it is moved to background waiting list where it will be executed only when the foreground list is empty. After being moved to the background, the process is then run longer than before, usually 4 quanta. The time of execution is increased because the process obviously needs more than 2 quanta to finish (this is the reason it was moved to background). This gives the process the opportunity to finish within this newly designated time. If the process does not finish after this, it is then preempted and moved to the end of the background list. The advantage of the foreground-background algorithm is that it gives the process the opportunity to execute immediately after its creation, but scheduling in the background list is pure round-robin scheduling.

Broadly speaking, the standard family belongs to the set of Software Asset Management (or SAM) standards and is integrated with other Management System Standards. ISO/IEC 19770 day-to-day management comes under ISO/IEC JTC1/SC7/WG21, or Working Group 21 (WG21) chaired by Ron Brill as convener and Trent Allgood as secretary. It is WG21 that is responsible for developing, improving and ensuring market needs are met when developing these standards. What is the purpose of ISO 19770? The ISO 19770 standard is a concept of ITAM standardization within an organization incorporating ISO/IEC standards. The objective of the standard is to give organizations of all sizes information and assistance to assist at the risk and cost minimization of ITAM assets. Through implementation, these same organizations will acquire a competitive advantage through: * Management of the risk of interrupted IT service delivery, breach of legal agreements and audit; * Reducing overall software costs through the implementation of various processes; and * Better information availability leading to improved decision- making based on accurate data. The major parts of this ITAM standard are detailed below. # ISO/IEC 19770-1 is a process framework to enable an organization to prove that it is performing ITAM to a standard sufficient to satisfy corporate governance requirements and ensure effective support for IT service management overall. # ISO/IEC 19770-2 provides an ITAM data standard for software identification tags (\\"SWID\\"). # ISO/IEC 19770-3 provides an ITAM data standard for software entitlements, including usage rights, limitations and metrics (\\"ENT\\"). # ISO/IEC 19770-4 provides an ITAM data standard for Resource Utilization Measurement (\\"RUM\\") # ISO/IEC 19770-5 provides the overview and vocabulary. 19770 Family Block Diagram ISO/IEC 19770-1: Processes ISO/IEC 19770-1 is a framework of ITAM processes to enable an organization to prove that it is performing software asset management to a standard sufficient to satisfy corporate governance requirements and ensure effective support for IT service management overall. ISO/IEC 19770-1:2017 specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and improvement of a management system for IT asset management (ITAM), referred to as an “IT asset management system” (ITAMS). While ISO 55001:2014 specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and improvement of a management system for asset management, referred to as an “asset management system”, it is primarily focused on physical assets with little provision for the management of software assets. There are a number of characteristics of IT assets which create additional or more detailed requirements. As a result of these characteristics of IT assets, the 19770-1 management system for IT assets has explicit additional requirements dealing with: * controls over software modification, duplication and distribution, with particular emphasis on access and integrity controls; * audit trails of authorizations and of changes made to IT assets; * controls over licensing, underlicensing, overlicensing, and compliance with licensing terms and conditions; * controls over situations involving mixed ownership and responsibilities, such as in cloud computing and with ‘Bring-Your-Own-Device’ (BYOD) practices; and * reconciliation of IT asset management data with data in other information systems when justified by business value, in particular with financial information systems recording assets and expenses. = Updates to 19770-1= The first generation was published in 2006. The second generation was published in 2012. It retained the original content (with only minor changes) but splits the standard up into four tiers which can be attained sequentially. These tiers are: * Tier 1: Trustworthy Data * Tier 2: Practical Management * Tier 3: Operational Integration * Tier 4: Full ISO/IEC ITAM Conformance ISO 19770-1 Edition 3 (current version) The most recent version, known as ISO 19770-1:2017 and published in December 2017, specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and improvement of a management system for IT asset management (ITAM), referred to as an IT asset management system. ISO 19770-1:2017 was a major update and was rewrote the standard to conform to the ISO Management System Standards (MSS) format. The tiered structure from 197701:2012 was moved to an appendix within the updated standard. Intended Users This document can be used by any organization and can be applied to all types of IT assets. The organization determines to which of its IT assets this document applies. This document is primarily intended for use by: * those involved in the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and improvement of an IT asset management system; * those involved in delivering IT asset management activities, including service providers; * internal and external parties to assess the organization’s ability to meet legal, regulatory and contractual requirements and the organization’s own requirements. = Preview of 19770-1= An overview of the standard is available from ISO and is available in English ISO/IEC 19770-2: software identification tag ISO/IEC 19770-2 provides an ITAM data standard for software identification (SWID) tags. Software ID tags provide authoritative identifying information for installed software or other licensable item (such as fonts or copyrighted papers). = Overview of SWID tags in use = There are three primary methods that may be used to ensure SWID tags are available on devices with installed software: * SWID tags created by a software creator or publisher which are installed with the software are the most authoritative for identification purposes. * Organizations can create their own SWID tags for any software title that does not include a tag, allowing the organization to more accurately track software installations in their network environment * Third party discovery tools may optionally add tags to a device as software titles are discovered Providing accurate software identification data improves organizational security, and lowers the cost and increases the capability of many IT processes such as patch management, desktop management, help desk management, software policy compliance, etc. Discovery tools, or processes that utilize SWID tag data to determine the normalized names and values that are associated with a software application and ensure that all tools and processes used by an organization refer to software products with the same exact names and values. = Standards development information = This standard was first published in November 2009.ISO/IEC 19770-2:2009(en) A revision of this standard was published in October 2015. Steve Klos is the editor of 19770-2 and works for 1E, Inc as a SAM Subject Matter Expert. = Non-profit organizational support = In 2009, a non-profit organization called TagVault.org was formed under IEEE-ISTO to press for using SWID tags. TagVault.org acts as a registration and certification authority for ISO/IEC 19770-2 software identification tags (SWID tags) and will provide tools and services allowing all SAM ecosystem members to take advantage of SWID tags faster, with a lower cost and with more industry compatibility than would otherwise be possible. SWID tags can be created by anyone, so individuals and organizations are not required to be part of TagVault.org to create or distribute tags. = Commercial organizational support= Numerous Windows installation packaging tools utilize SWID tags including: * Caphyon's Advanced Installer * Flexera Software's InstallShield * Flexera Software's InstallAnywhere * Open Source - Windows Installer XML Toolset (WiX) Many software discovery tools already utilize SWID tags, including Altiris, Aspera SmartCollect, DeskCenter Management Suite, Belarc's BelManage, Sassafras Software's K2-KeyServer, Snow Inventory, CA Technologies discovery tools, Eracent's EnterpriseAM, Flexera Software's FlexNet Manager Platform, HP's Universal Discovery, IBM Endpoint Manager, Microsoft's System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager, and Loginventory. Adobe has released multiple versions of their Creative Suites and Creative Cloud products with SWID tags. Symantec has also released multiple products that include SWID tags and is committed to helping move the software community to a more consistent and normalized approach to software identification and eventually to a more automated approach to compliance.see Microsoft Corporation has been adding SWID tags to all new releases of software products since Windows 8 was released. IBM started shipping tags with some software products in early 2014, but as of November, all releases of IBM software include SWID tags. This equates to approximately 300 product releases a month that include SWID tags. = Governmental support = The US federal government has identified 19770-2 SWID tags as an important aspect of the efforts necessary to manage compliance, logistics and security software processes. The 19770-2 standard is included on the US Department of Defense Information Standards Registry (DISR) as an emerging standard as of September 2012. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) in 2015 discussed the need for SWIDs in the marketplace.A copy of that presentation is available here = Standards development organization support = The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) is developing a standard TNC SWID Messages and Attributes for IF-M SpecificationTNC SWID Messages and Attributes for IF-M Specification that utilizes tag data for security purposes. The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) has documented the Software Asset Management Continuous Monitoring building block that specifies how SWID tags are used for the near real-time identification of software. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is in the process of creating documentation that specifies how SWID tags will be used by governmental organizations including the Department of Homeland Security. David Waltermire presented information describing the NIST Security Automation Program and how SWID tags can support that effort. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published \\"Guidelines for the Creation of Interoperable Software Identification (SWID) Tags\\", NISTIR 8060, April 2016. = Preview of ISO 19770-2:2015 = An overview of the standard is available from ISO and is available in English ISO/IEC 19770-3: software entitlement schema (ENT) This part of ISO/IEC 19770 provides a technical definition of an XML schema that can encapsulate the details of software entitlements, including usage rights, limitations and metrics. The primary intentions of 19770-3 are: # To provide a basis for common terminology to be used when describing entitlement rights, limitations and metrics # To provide a schema which allows effective description of rights, limitations and metrics attaching to a software license. The specific information provided by an entitlement schema (ENT) may be used to help ensure compliance with license rights and limits, to optimize license usage and to control costs. Though ENT creators are encouraged to provide the data that allow for the automatic processing, it is not mandated that data be automatically measurable. The data structure is intended to be capable of containing any kind of terms and conditions included in a software license agreement. This part of ISO/IEC 19770 supports ITAM processes as defined in ISO/IEC 19770-1 It is also designed to work together with software identification tags as defined in ISO/IEC 19770-2. Standardization in the field of software entitlements provides uniform, measurable data for both the license compliance, and license optimization, processes of SAM practice. This part of ISO/IEC 19770 does not provide requirements or recommendations for processes related to software asset management or ENTs. The software asset management processes are in the scope of ISO/IEC 19770-1. =Standards development information= The ISO/IEC 19770-3 Other Working Group (\\"OWG\\")Web site from the working group developing the 19770-3 standard was convened by teleconference call on 9 September 2008. John Tomeny of Sassafras Software Inc served as the convener and lead author of the ISO/IEC 19770-3 \\"Other Working Group\\" (later renamed the ISO/IEC 19770-3 Development Group). Mr Tomeny was appointed by Working Group 21 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7/WG 21) together with Krzysztof Bączkiewicz of Eracent who served as Project Editor concurrent with Mr. Tomeny's leadership. In addition to WG21 members, other participants in the 19770-3 Development Group served as \\"individuals considered to have relevant expertise by the Convener\\".W21N0805 (revision 2): Terms of Reference for ISO/IEC 19770-3 Software Entitlement Tag Other Working Group Jason Keogh of 1E and part of the delegation from Ireland is the current editor of 19770-3. ISO/IEC 19770-3 was published on April 15, 2016. =Principles= This part of ISO/IEC 19770 has been developed with the following practical principles in mind: Maximum possible usability with legacy entitlement information The ENT, or software entitlement schema, is intended to provide the maximum possible usability with existing entitlement information, including all historical licensing transactions. While the specifications provide many opportunities for improvement in entitlement processes and practices, they must be able to handle existing licensing transactions without imposing requirements which would prevent such transactions being codified into Ent records. Maximum possible alignment with the software identification tag specification (ISO/IEC 19770-2) This part of ISO/IEC 19770 (entitlement schema) is intended to align closely with part 2 of the standard (software identification tags). This should facilitate both understanding and their joint use. Furthermore, any of the elements, attributes, or other specifications of part 2 which the ENT creator may wish to utilize may be used in this part as well. =Stakeholder benefits= It is intended that this standardized schema will be of benefit to all stakeholders involved in the creation, licensing, distribution, release, installation, and ongoing management of software and software entitlements. *Benefits to software licensors who provide ENTs include, but are not limited to: ** Immediate software customer recognition of details of the usage rights derived from their software entitlement. ** Ability to specify details to customers that allow software assets to be measured and reported for license compliance purposes. ** Increased awareness of software license compliance issues on the part of end-customers. ** Improved software customer relationships through quicker and more effective license compliance audits. *Benefits to SAM tool providers, deployment tool providers, re-sellers, value-added re-sellers, packagers and release managers include, but are not limited to: ** Receipt of consistent and uniform data from software licensors and ENT creators. ** More consistent and structured entitlement information, supporting the use of automated techniques to determine the need for remediation of software licensing. ** Improved reporting from additional categorization made possible by the use of ENTs. ** Improved SAM tool entitlement reconciliation capabilities resulting from standardization in location and format of software entitlement data. ** Ability to deliver value-added functionality for compliance management through the consumption of entitlement data. *The benefits for software customers, SAM practitioners, IT support professionals and end users of a given software configuration item include, but are not limited to: ** Receipt of consistent and uniform data from software licensors, resellers and SAM tools providers. ** More consistent and structured entitlement information supporting the use of automated techniques to determine the need for remediation of software licensing. ** Improved reporting from additional categorization made possible by the use of ENTs. ** Improved SAM and software license compliance capabilities stemming from standardized, software licensor-supplied, ISO/IEC 19770-2 software identification tags to reconcile with these ENTs. ** Improved ability to avoid software license under-procurement or over-procurement with subsequent cost optimization. ** Standardized usage across multiple platforms, rendering heterogeneous computing environments more manageable. The ITAM Review developed a podcast with the 19770-3 project editor how end-user organizations can leverage this standard to their benefit. The link to the podcast is here. =ISO 19770-3= ISO 19770-3 relates to Entitlement tags - encapsulations of licensing terms, rights and limitations in a machine-readable, standardized format. The transport method (XML, JSON, etc.) is not defined, rather the meaning and name of specific data stores is outlined to facilitate a common schema between vendors and customers and tools providers. The first commercial SAM tool to encapsulate ISO 19770-3 was AppClarity by 1E. Since then K2 by Sassafras Software has also encompassed 19770-3. As of the time of writing (February 2018) although other tools vendors have indicated interest in the standard but have not implemented same. It is of note that Jason Keogh, Editor of the released 19770-3 works for 1E and John Tomeny (initial Editor of 19770-3) worked for Sassafras Software. 19770-3 was released in 2016 and can be downloaded from the main ISO web store.  ISO/IEC 19770-4: Resource Utilization Measurement  This document provides an International Standard for Resource Utilization Measurement (RUM). A RUM is a standardized structure containing usage information about the resources that are related to the use of an IT asset. A RUM will often be provided in an XML data file, but the same information may be accessible through other means depending on the platform and the IT asset/product. This document contains information structures that are designed to align with the identification information defined in ISO/IEC 19770-2, and with the entitlement information defined in ISO/IEC 19770-3. When used together, these three types of information have the capability to significantly enhance and automate the processes of IT asset management. This document supports the IT asset management processes defined in ISO/IEC 19770-1. This document also supports the other parts of the ISO/IEC 19770 series of standards that define information structures. The RUM is specifically designed to be general-purpose and usable in a wide variety of situations. Like other information structures defined in the ISO/IEC 19770 series of standards, the consumer of a RUM may be an organization and/or a tool or other consumers. In contrast to the other information structures in the ISO/IEC 19770 series, the entity creating a RUM data on a periodic basis will likely be an IT asset or an automation tool monitoring an IT asset. The definition of a RUM will benefit all stakeholders involved in the creation, licensing, distribution, releasing, installation, and on-going management of IT assets. Key benefits associated with a RUM for three specific groups of stakeholders include: IT asset users — RUM data will typically be generated and processed by IT assets and automation tools, within the consumers enterprise boundary, for purpose of IT asset compliance and optimization; — RUM data is human readable and can provide improved visibility into resource utilization within IT assets independent of vendor or third-party supplied tools; — the ability to combine identification, entitlement, and resource utilization information together to perform quantitative and authoritative IT asset management, for example, to meet compliance requirements; — a much- improved ability to perform IT asset management in support of green data center strategies such as optimization of the use of power and air conditioning; IT asset manufacturers — the ability to consistently and authoritatively generate resource utilization information for consumption by a central facility that is maintained by the creator, or one or more third-party tools, or by the IT asset users; — the ability to support multiple instances and types of third-party tools with a single set of functionality within the IT asset; — the ability to offer a service to track real-time IT asset usage in the field and, when combined with identification and entitlement information, the ability to give advance warning as resource limits are approached; — the ability to offer an alternative approach to asset utilization measurement to traditional techniques that employ key-based, or platform-restricted licenses; Tool vendors — the ability to support multiple IT assets, and types of IT asset, without having to create and maintain unique instrumentation that is associated with each asset; — the ability to more easily aggregate usage information across multiple instances of an asset; — a much-improved ability to track resource utilization and IT assets in near real-time. = Preview ISO/IEC 19770-4: Resource Utilization Measurement = An overview of the standard is available from ISO and is available in English here.  ISO/IEC 19770-5: overview and vocabulary  ISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 provides an overview of ITAM, which is the subject of the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards, and defines related terms. ISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 is applicable to all types of organization (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies, non-profit organizations). ISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 contains: # an overview of the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards; # an introduction to SAM; # a brief description of the foundation principles and approaches on which SAM is based; and # consistent terms and definitions for use throughout the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards. = Free copy of ISO/IEC 19770-5 = A free copy of the overview and vocabulary is available here.

These snakes are also known as the Malagasy Blind Snake. Physical characteristics The family Xenotyphlopidae is composed of small blind snakes. These members lack cranial infrared receptors in pits or durface indentations. It is thought that these snakes used to have eyes but lost use of them over time. Members of the genus Xenotyphlops are distinguishable externally from the Typhlopidae by possessing a greatly enlarged and nearly circular rostral shield and a single enlarged anal shield. This shield is nearly vertical in a lateral aspect; as a result, the two species have a \\"bulldozer\\" appearance. Xenotyphlops get no larger than an earthworm and have translucent pink scales. Xenotyphlops species are internally unique in that they lack a tracheal lung and possess an unexpanded tracheal membrane.. Retrieved 27 May 2019. Like many other snake families they are assumed to be oviparous. Both species are completely terrestrial. Geographic range Snakes of the genus Xenotyphlops are endemic to the island of Madagascar. Xenotyphlops burrow in the softer sandy soil of Madagascar's coastline forest and shrubland. For over 100 years the genus was known only from the type locality, which was \\"Madagascar\\", and only from the type specimens.McDiarmid RW, Campbell JA, Touré TA (1999). Snake Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference, Volume 1. Washington, District of Columbia: Herpetologists’ League. 511 pp. These snakes presumably live in colonies of subterranean social insects.  Conservation Status  According to the IUCN Red List, X. grandidieri are considered to be critically endangered and X. mocquardi are data deficient. The two biggest threats to these species are Energy production (via Mining/quarrying) and biological resource use (via logging & unintentional effects). Species *Xenotyphlops grandidieri *Xenotyphlops mocquardi Nota bene: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than Xenotyphlops. Etymology The specific name, grandidieri, is in honor of French naturalist Alfred Grandidier.Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Xenotyphlops grandidieri, pp. 105-106; X. mocquardi, p. 181). The specific name, mocquardi, is in honor of French herpetologist François Mocquard. Taxonomy In 2013, after examining several newly collected specimens, Wegener, Tommy Peto et al. concluded that X. mocquardi falls within the range of variation of X. grandidieri, and they proposed that X. mocquardi be considered a synonym of X. grandidieri. This change would make Xenotyphlops a monotypic genus in a monotypic family.Wegener JE, Swoboda S, Hawlitschek O, Franzen M, Wallach V, Vences M, Nagy ZT, Hedges SB, Köhler J, Glaw F (2013). \\"Morphological variation and taxonomic reassessment of the endemic Malagasy blind snake family Xenotyphlopidae (Serpentes, Scolecophidia)\\".

Biography Born and raised in Syracuse, New York, Finley became a nightclub manager in his hometown at age 18 before moving to Los Angeles, California in the 1930s and opening a chain of jewelry stores. In the 1940s, he became a business partner with musicians Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey in ownership of the Casino Gardens Ballroom in San Diego, where he also owned radio station KSDJ. He created his own TV production company, Finley Productions, Inc., the first such operation on the West Coast. In 1945, Larry unsuccessfully filed a lawsuit against MCA Inc. for $3,000,000, claiming there was a conspiracy to restrain trade, and operating a monopoly. Finley produced and hosted radio and TV shows in Los Angeles, including The Larry Finley Show, broadcast nightly from his restaurant on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood; as well as Strictly Informal, Dinner At Eight, and Music is My Beat, the first TV shows to be kinescoped and aired by the Armed Forces Television Network to troops in Korea. It was towards the early 1950s that Finley launched PBS as an attempt at a fifth nationwide radio network. The network existed from November 26, 1950 until January 31, 1951. In the mid-1960s, Finley founded & became President and CEO of the International Tape Cartridge Corporation (I.T.C.C.). He acquired the audio tape rights from 57 record labels and became the largest provider of music entertainment on pre-recorded tape. Then in late 1968 he formed NAL (North American Leisure Corp.) which also produced Music Tape Cartridges and Cassette Tapes and wanted to expand into other phases of the entertainment industry. In 1970, he founded the International Tape Association, which is now known as the International Recording Media Association (IRMA), at a time when audio tape products were still finding their market and he also helped standardize the various types of audiotapes. Finley died April 2000, in Long Island, New York at age 86. Honors and awards Among the honors he received during his lifetime were: The Los Angeles City of Hope's Annual Torch Bearer Award in 1955, Time-Life Magazine's Man of the Decade Award in 1980, induction into the Video Hall of Fame in 1984, and in 1998 he received the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Vision Fund of America.

The Santa Fe Weekly Gazette reported that the action \\"was one of the severest battles that ever took place between American troops and Red Indians.\\" It was one of the first significant battles between American and Apache forces and was also part of the Ute Wars, in which Ute warriors attempted to resist Westward expansion in the Four Corners region. Background Companies F and I, regiment of the First Dragoons camped at Cantonment Burgwin, an army post 10 miles southeast of Taos. While on patrol, 60 dragoons engaged in an unauthorized attack on the Jicarilla Apache encampment near Pilar, then known as Cieneguilla, after First Lieutenant John Wynn Davidson exceeded the orders of his superior officer, Major Blake. Battle A combined force of about 250 Apaches and Utes laid an ambush for the U.S. dragoons. In his report two days after the battle, Davidson stated that \\"[He] came upon the Apaches near Cieneguilla who at once sounded the war whoop.\\" According to Private James A. Bennett (aka James Bronson), a sergeant who survived the ambush, the battle lasted about four hours. It started around 8 a.m. and ended when the dragoon regiments retreated at 12 p.m. to Ranchos de Taos. The Apache warriors used flintlock rifles and arrows. Of the 60 dragoons present, the U.S. suffered twenty-two killed and a further thirty-six wounded, along with a loss of twenty-two horses and much of the troops' supplies.A losing battle - The Albuquerque Tribune Another version of the fight Gorenfeld, Will, The Battle of Cieneguilla, Wild West magazine, Feb., 2008 presents the view that Davidson and his troops were not ambushed, but rather were taunted by the Apaches into attacking a superior force, one that also employed superior tactics. This modern version also has the duration of the fight being closer to two hours than the four that Davidson and Bennett claimed. Aftermath Lieutenant Colonel Philip St. George Cooke of the Second Regiment of Dragoons at once organized an expedition to pursue the Jicarilla. With the help of Pueblo Indian and Mexican scouts under Captain James H. Quinn, with Kit Carson as the principal guide. After a winter pursuit through the mountains, Cooke caught and defeated them April 8, at their camp in the canyon of Ojo Caliente. Dispersing in small bands, the Jicarilla evaded further pursuit, but many died from the harsh cold weather.

Gen. John Garland praised Davidson when stated that \\"The troops displayed a gallantry seldom equalled in this, or any other country and the Officer in Command, Lieut. Davidson, has given evidence of soldiership in the highest degree creditable to him. To have sustained a deadly control of three hours when he was so greatly outnumbered, and to have retired with the fragment of a company, crippled up, is amazing and calls for the admiration of every true soldier.\\"Garland to Thomas, April 1, 1854, Sen.

After many witnessing declarations, the court declared that Davidson could not have avoided the confrontation and \\"that in the battle he exhibited skill in his mode of attacking a greatly superior force of hostile Indians; and prudence, and coolness, and courage, throughout a protracted engagement; and finally, when he was obliged to retire from the field, owing to the great odds opposing him, the losses he had sustained, and the scarcity of ammunition; his exertions to bring off the wounded men merit high praise.\\"Orders No. 3, HQ DNM, Mar. 26, 1856, ibid., 348-349.

He was one of the three most important Baroque architects active in the Piedmont region of Northern Italy; the other two were Filippo Juvarra and Guarino Guarini. The youngest of the three, Vittone was the only one who was born in the Piedmont. He achieved a synthesis of the spatial inventiveness of Juvarra and the engineering ingenuity of Guarini, particularly in the design of his churches, the buildings for which he is best known.  Life and works Vittone was born in Turin into a mercantile family. He may have been introduced to architecture by his uncle, the architect Gian Giacomo Plantery and might have worked under Juvarra before departing for Rome.‘Vittone, Bernardo Antonio’, Oxford Art Online, accessed Feb. 14, 2010 In Rome, Vittone won a first prize in the Accademia di San Luca in 1732. His architectural studies in Rome included works by Carlo Fontana and he was elected to the Academy in 1733 just prior to his return to Turin. From 1735, he was engaged in preparing Guarini's Architettura Civile for publication in 1737. Following the death of Juvarra in 1736, several architectural commissions came his way. However, when the royal House of Savoy resumed its patronage of architecture in the early 1740s, they appointed Benedetto Innocente Alfieri as their architect, not Vittone. Instead, Vittone built up a clientele of patrons for who he designed buildings in the area around Turin. Vittone's most inventive and memorable works are the parish churches, remote from the main cities. They include the Sanctuary della Visitazione at Vallinotto (1738–1739), near Carignano, erected for agricultural workers of the town. The exterior has a tiered dome, but the hexagonal interior has the geometric elaborations with alternating convex and concave chapels that recall the architecture of Juvarra and Borromini. In the dome, the elaborately decorated ribs, reminiscent of Guarini's work, intersect to form a complex design illuminated by natural light playfully concealed by hidden windows. Another masterpiece is the church of Santa Chiara at Bra (1741-2); with a central double shell dome with ornamented openings in the lower shell which offer views through to the painted second shell. He also designed the Ospizio or Albergo di Carita (1744-9) at Carignano (for the indigent homeless) with its central chapel; the parish churches of Grignasco and Borgo d'Ale; the choir of S. Maria di Piazza and church of Santa Chiara in Turin; the church of Santa Maria Maddalena in Alba, the parish church of Santissimo Salvatore at Borgomasino, and the church of the Confraternity of Santa Croce (1755) at Villanova Mondovì. In 1766, he completed the church of San Bernardino at Riva di Chieri, with the help of his apprentices Andrea Rana and Pietro Bonvicini. Some of his late churches show an architectural restraint not apparent in his earlier works. Vittone wrote two architectural treatises. The first was the lengthy Istruzioni elementari Full book title: Istruzioni elementari per indirizzo de ‘giovani allo studio dell’ Architettura Civile published in 1760 that was largely concerned with the column orders, and the second was the Istruzioni diverse Full book title: Istruzione diverse concernanti l'officio dell'Architetto Civile of 1766 that included his own works. Both were dominated by traditional Renaissance musical theory of proportion, which is perhaps rather surprising given that Vittone had edited Guarini's treatise and absorbed the lessons on projective geometry so well in his own architectural designs. The co-existence of the innovative and the traditional in Vittone ‘s writings has been commented on by the art historian Wittkower. He pointed out that Vittone attempted to mathematically prove the correct classic proportions of buildings, and that he used the recent discoveries of light by Newton to address questions of architecture; and he ends with a dedication to God and the Virgin Mary. He describes Vittone as: > an architect of rare ability, full of original ideas and of a creative > capacity equalled only by few of the masters...What little we know of him > suggests that his was an obsessed genius. This is also the impression one > carries away from reading his two treatises, the Istruzioni elementari of > 1760 and the Istruzioni diverse of 1766. The earlier treatise is one of the > longest ever written, and the later consists to a large extent of appendices > to the first....the extraordinary thing about his treatises is that > basically he has not moved far from Alberti's position ... (while) Alberti > wanted to elevate and inform the mind, Vittone wants to delight. He also > incorporates recent research -but for what purpose? ...Proportion is the one > and all of these treatises, and Vittone's terms of reference are precisely > those of Renaissance theory. When Vittone died in 1770, and although his former pupils, Rana and Bonavici, continued Vittone's Late Baroque style of architecture, European architecture was moving steadily towards Neo-classicism.Wittkower, Rudolf.

They had three sons and two daughters. Career By 1855 Drake had saved enough to purchase a quarter interest in leading Chicago hotel, Tremont House. He was the sole owner within 15 years. However, the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 burned down the Tremont. At the height of the fire, he made a payment on the Michigan Avenue Hotel at Michigan Avenue and Congress Street. The fire had been directly across the street from the hotel, but it managed to be the only hotel on the South side to escape the great fire. In 1873, he took over the Grand Pacific Hotel.

Classification Two varieties of Magnolia kobus are recognized by some sources, such as Hortus Third, with var. borealis being a tree to 25 m (75 ft) high, with leaves to 15 cm (6 in) long, and var. kobus, a tree to 10 m (30 ft) high, with leaves to 10 cm (4 in) long. Magnolia kobus is classified within Magnolia subgenus Yulania. The kobus magnolia is closely related to the star magnolia (Magnolia stellata), and some authorities consider the star magnolia to be a variety of M. kobus, M. kobus var. stellata. Description Magnolia kobus blooms in the early spring, bearing pleasantly fragrant white flowers with hints of pale pink about 10 cm (4 in) in diameter. The flowers are produced before the leaves, as with most members of Magnolia subgenus Yulania. Young trees do not flower. The summer foliage of the kobus magnolia is dark green. Leaves have an obovate shape with a pointed tip, a smooth, or glabrous, leaf underside, and smooth, even edges. Leaves are 8–15 cm (3–6 in) long, in an alternating arrangement. In autumn, the leaves take on a yellow color and drop from the tree. Magnolia kobus in flower, with a singular blossom in the foreground eclipsing an array of blossoms in the midground, over the backdrop of a waterway. Photographed in the Kantō region of Japan The fruit of the kobus magnolia grows in groups of small red seeds. The groupings are one to three inches in size, and the seeds attract birds. Older bark, such as that of the trunk, is grey-brown, while new stems are green with small brown spots. There is a strong odor to broken branches or twigs. A seed estimated to be 2,000 years old was found in a pit in the ancient bronze-age village of Asada. The archaeologists planted the seed thinking that surely it wouldn't grow but they were wrong. Unlike the other Magnolia trees it had 7 or 8 petals on its blossoms rather than six.

Her work often featured Minnesota women who must identify the moral crisis that is facing their community or themselves and enact change through empathy, or opening one's eyes to the realities of the situation. Early years =Childhood= Carolyn McLean Bly was the youngest child and only daughter of Charles Russell and Mildred Washburn McLean of Duluth, Minnesota. She was raised in Duluth and Tryon, North Carolina, where she was sent to live with one of her father's sisters because her mother suffered from tuberculosis and was often away from the family being treated in sanitariums. Bly's mother died in 1942, at a time when two of her older brothers were fighting in World War II. As a young teen, Bly worried for the safety of her family and often had nightmares about the Gestapo. Bly never lost her preoccupation with the damage that evil people could do. =Education= After graduating from the Abbot Academy boarding school Bly received her B.A. in English and history from Wellesley College in 1951 and spent several years working in New York and Boston before undertaking graduate-level work at the University of Minnesota in 1954 and 1955. =Family= While at Wellesley, Bly met Robert Elwood Bly on a blind date. She was Episcopalian; he was Lutheran. They married in 1955 and moved to Robert Bly's family farm near the small town of Madison, Minnesota. At the time, the farm had no running water. The family lived a relatively simple life, and as she once told a disbelieving census taker, instead of owning a television they entertained themselves with their five thousand plus books. Their house was usually filled with visiting poets, including Donald Hall, James Wright, and Bill Holm, all of whom were asked to do their share of chores before Bly would feed them. The couple had four children, Micah, Bridget, Noah, and Mary, who is now an English professor at Fordham University and a best-selling romance novelist under the pseudonym Eloisa James. Carol and Robert Bly divorced in 1979. Career While her children were small, Bly worked on the farm when necessary and found time to manage the literary journals published by her husband and William Duffy, Fifties and Sixties, as well as managing their business, the Sixties and the Seventies Press. At the beginning of the next decade, Bly was asked to write a monthly column, \\"A Letter from the Country\\" for the Minnesota Public Radio Magazine. Writing these short essays about rural life taught her how to think and to express herself well in a relatively small number of pages. The essays were later compiled into the book Letters From the Country, published in 1981. Three of her stories were also combined into the movie Rachel River, which starred Craig T. Nelson. =Works= Bly's short stories are known for their realistic characters and situations, which are fully developed within the small number of pages the story allows. Although many of her stories are set in Minnesota, the people and the situations transcend local boundaries, emphasizing pride in one's work, resourcefulness, the ability to laugh at one's self, and the ability \\"to hold values beyond one's own immediate welfare.\\" Perhaps inspired by Robert Bly's co-founding of American Writers Against the Vietnam War in 1966, Bly used her literature to reflect modern-day concerns. Her work is in many ways an ethical treatise, often featuring a \\"bully\\", embodied by either a person or a corporation, who takes pleasure in forcing his will on another person or group of people. Some of her stories also explore evil, which, to her, is seen in people or organizations which find enjoyment in enslaving, humiliating, or crushing their opponents. The stories emphasize redemption through empathy, which, to Bly, is the step of deliberately looking at how one's actions impact others. Bly always called herself a C.S. Lewis person; she dutifully read Bonhoeffer, but found him dull. A typical Bly protagonist is a conventional woman who has been content to live in \\"ignorant complacency,\\" but, through her own strength and intelligence must first identify the moral crisis facing either her or her community and then work to accomplish change. In her best works, the moral center is hard to find, as each character has some claim to the reader's sympathies. =Teaching= To reach a broader audience, Bly wrote several books to assist others in learning to write well. Rather than concentrate on the technical basics of writing a story, these books provide tips for writing a story that is \\"morally, politically, and emotionally deep.\\" Her books are somewhat controversial, as they encourage students to use \\"the sort of 'empathetic questioning' therapists and social workers use\\" in order to find their strongest feelings and amplify their ideas. These principles were demonstrated during the four creative writing workshops that Bly taught each spring in Saint Paul, Minnesota as well as in the talks and readings she gave. The workshops were of limited size, usually including only eight students, with Bly lecturing as well as providing individual advice and criticism of the student's works. =Recognition= Bly was awarded the 2001 Minnesota Humanities Award for Literature. She had previously been named the University of Minnesota Edelstein-Keller Distinguished Minnesota Author (1998–1999) and the Minnesota Women's Press Favorite Woman Author (2000). A past member of the Board of Directors for both The Loft Literary Center (1991–1994) and Episcopal Community Services (1978–1979), Bly was also a member of the Minnesota Book and Literary Arts Building Authors' Advisory Group in 1999. She has designed workshops for Women Against Military Madness, National Association of Social Workers, and the Midwest Institute of School Social Workers, and was a consultant to the Land Stewardship Project from 1983-1992. Later years Following her divorce from Robert Bly, Bly moved to Sturgeon Lake; in 1986, she bought a house in St. Paul MN. In 2003, Bly donated to the University of Minnesota her correspondence, notes from writing workshops and classes she taught, and drafts of her works. The eighty-nine boxes included papers written when she was just a child as well as her later years' work. Also in 2003 Bly and a friend, Cynthia Loveland, opened Bly and Loveland Press, a small publishing company which has so far published four books that they have written together. Their press also sold custom crossword puzzles, which Bly designed. She continued to work until the very end of her life, completing a novel, \\"Shelter Half,\\" which was published posthumously in June, 2008 by Holy Cow! Press.

Biography Dame Edith was born in Saint Petersburg, the eldest daughter of Archibald Balfour, a London businessman and merchant in the Russian Empire, and Sophia \\"Sophy\\" Weguelin, daughter of MP Thomas Matthias Weguelin. Edith was educated privately and moved in the aristocratic circle of friends known as \\"the Souls\\", which included A. J. Balfour, George Curzon, Margot Tennant (later Asquith), and Alfred Lyttelton, whom she married. Together they had two surviving children, including Oliver Lyttelton (later 1st Viscount Chandos). Activism During their visit to South Africa in 1900, Lyttelton developed a high regard for Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner, and helped establish the Victoria League in 1901 with Violet Markham and Violet Cecil to promote the imperial vision advocated by Milner. The League brought together high-ranking women from different sides of the political divide on the common ground of the empire. She served as its Honorary Secretary and also supported the Women's Tariff Reform Association. Lyttelton served on the Executive of the National Union of Women Workers (founded in 1895) and as Chairwoman of the Personal Service Association (founded in 1908, to alleviate distress caused by unemployment in London). At the outbreak of World War I she was a founder of the War Refugees Committee. She was later made Deputy Director of the Women's Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture in 1917, served on the Central Committee of Women's Employment from 1916–1925, and as Vice-Chairman of the Waste Reclamation Trade Board from 1924–1931. She was also the British substitute delegate in Geneva to the League of Nations in 1923, 1926–1928, and 1931. Spiritualism After the death of her husband in 1913, she became interested in spiritualism and was a member, and President from 1933 to 1934, of the council of the Society for Psychical Research. Spiritualism heavily influenced her works, The Faculty of Communion (1925), Our Superconscious Mind (1931), and Some Cases of Prediction (1937), as well her biography of Florence Upton (1926). Writings Dame Edith wrote a novel, The Sinclair Family (1926), an account of her travels in the Far East and India, Travelling Days (1933), and published a biography of her former husband in March 1917. Among her seven plays, two were inspired by her campaign against sweated labour, Warp and Woof and The Thumbscrew. She also translated Edmond Rostand's Les deux pierrots. She was encouraged by her close friendship with George Bernard Shaw and Mrs. Patrick Campbell. After 1918 she also lobbied for the foundation of a national theatre in London and was a member of the Executive Committee of the Shakespeare Memorial National Theatre. Honours In August 1917, Lyttelton was among the first group of people honoured following the creation of the Order of the British Empire by King George V, when she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order (DBE) for her work with refugees. She and was named Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 1929 New Year Honours, for public services. Personal life Balfour married into the Lyttelton family as the second wife of the Hon. Alfred Lyttelton, the eighth son of the fourth Lord Lyttelton. They married at Bordighera on the Italian Riviera on 18 April 1892, six years after the death of his first wife, Octavia Laura Tennant (daughter of Sir Charles Tennant), who had died after only a year of marriage. They had three children: *Oliver Lyttelton, 1st Viscount Chandos (15 March 1893 – 21 January 1972) *Mary Frances Lyttelton (1 July 1895 – 24 October 1982), married in 1928 Sir George Craik, 2nd Baronet *Anthony George Lyttelton (3 June 1900 – 17 December 1901) Her husband died in 1913.

The site includes Caerleon Amphitheatre and is protected by Cadw. Headquarters of the Legion \\"II Augusta\\", which took part in the invasion under Emperor Claudius in 43, Isca is uniquely important for the study of the conquest, pacification and colonisation of Britannia by the Roman army. It was one of only three permanent legionary fortresses in later Roman Britain and, unlike the other sites at Chester and York, its archaeological remains lie relatively undisturbed beneath fields and the town of Caerleon and provide a unique opportunity to study the Roman legions in Britain. Excavations continue to unearth new discoveries; in the late 20th century a complex of very large monumental buildings outside the fortress between the River Usk and the amphitheatre was uncovered. This new area of the canabae was previously unknown.\\"The Caerleon canabae: excavations in the civil settlement 1984-90\\" (2000), Edith Evans, Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies Name The Brythonic name Isca means \\"water\\" and refers to the River Usk. The suffix Augusta appears in the Ravenna Cosmography and was an honorific title taken from the legion stationed there. The place is commonly referred to as Isca Silurum to differentiate it from Isca Dumnoniorum and because it lay in the territory of the Silures tribe. However, there is no evidence that this form was used in Roman times. The later name, Caerleon, is derived from the Welsh for \\"fortress of the legion\\". Foundation and history Roman fortress walls, Isca Augusta A partially intact Roman tower at Caerleon, drawn in 1783 Isca was founded in 74 or 75 during the final campaigns by Governor Sextus Julius Frontinus against the fierce native tribes of western Britain, notably the Silures in South Wales who had resisted the Romans’ advance for over a generation. Isca became the headquarters of the Legion II Augusta based in the large fortress of typical legionary \\"playing- card\\" shape and built initially with an earth bank and timber palisade. It remained their headquarters until at least 300 AD. The interior was fitted out with the usual array of military buildings: a headquarters building, legate's residence, tribunes' houses, hospital, large bath house, workshops, barrack blocks, granaries and, unusually, a large amphitheatre.. At this time there were four legions in Britain out of a total of about 30 legions in the Empire, making Britain one of the most heavily militarised provinces due to its frontier status and hostile neighbours.Roman Legionary Fortresses 27BC-AD378: Duncan Campbell, Osprey Publishing Each legion consisted of over 5,000 heavily armed and highly disciplined professional soldiers who enlisted in the army for at least 20 years. As the backbone of the army, legionaries were the conquerors and builders of the Roman Empire who brought with them foreign ideas, practices and traditions that would change the society and culture of Britain forever. Legionary fortresses in 80AD An inscription of Trajan gives a date of AD99/100 for the replacement of the fortress walls, when the original earth and timber ramparts of the fortress were strengthened by the addition of a stone revetment at the front. This \\"composite\\" rampart consisted of a stone wall 5 to 5½ feet thick, backed by a clay bank and fronted by a single ditch By 120 AD, detachments or vexillations of the legion were needed elsewhere in the province and Isca became more of a military base than a garrison. However, it is thought that each cohort still maintained a presence at the fortress. When Septimius Severus seized power in the 190s, he had Isca refurbished and the legion were in residence rebuilding themselves after heavy losses on the Continent. Further restoration took place under Caracalla, when the south-west gate was rebuilt, the amphitheatre remodelled and barrack blocks re-roofed and otherwise repaired. The legion may have been called away to fight for one of the many emperors claiming power in the late 3rd century. Although most of the fort lay empty, a 'caretaker' squad are thought to have maintained the facilities and there was reoccupation and rebuilding work as late as the 270s. The main military structures are thought to have finally been demolished by the usurpers, Carausius or Allectus, when the legion was needed to repel a potential invasion from the Continent. The stone from Isca may have been used for building defences on the south coast. There may still have been an occasional military presence as late as the early 4th century, but the fortress was probably later taken over by the people of the surrounding vicus. The basilica of the baths was used as a cattle pen. Recent finds suggest Roman occupation of some kind as late as 380. Christian martyrs According to the Gildas (followed by Bede), Roman Caerleon was the site of two early Christian martyrdoms in Britain, at the same time as that of Saint Alban the first British martyr, who was killed in the Roman city of Verulamium (beside modern- day St Albans). He writes: This city of the legions is identified with Caerleon, rather than Chester, because there were two medieval chapels there dedicated to each of these martyrs. They were probably executed in 304, during the religious persecutions of Diocletian's reign. However, these chapels may have been founded as a result of Bede's writings and cannot be dated archaeologically any earlier than the church of St John's in Chester which is also situated next to an amphitheatre. Amphitheatre Because of its rounded form, the unexcavated amphitheatre was known to locals as 'King Arthur's Round Table', but there is no known connection. An initial investigation in 1909 showed the potential for a full-scale excavation of the structure, which began in 1926 and was supervised by Victor Erle Nash-Williams. This revealed, among other things, that the amphitheatre had been built around 80. This (Period I) building was destroyed by fire in the early-second century, and the second (Period II) building erected c.AD138 was destroyed around sixty years later c.196/7. It was rebuilt for the third and last time during the campaigns of Severus and Caracalla in Britain c.197–211. The Period III building finally fell into disuse around the middle of the fourth century at the same time that the Caerleon fortress was evacuated. The latest coin from this site is that of Valens (AD364–378). The arena is oval in shape, with eight entrances, and the stadium is thought to have had a capacity of around six thousand spectators, and apart from the usual gladiatorial entertainments, it was probably used for parades, displays and exercises by the garrison of the fortress.

It introduced financial compensation for slaves, and therefore penalties for owners, for instances of cruelty or serious neglect. The Act prohibited marriages between slaves according to Christian religious ceremony. The Act was effectively repealed by the Slave Trade Act 1807, which made it illegal to trade in slaves in any British territory. The Act applied in all of the British Leeward Island colonies in the Caribbean until its implied repeal by the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. The Act is most often noted for its provisions for financial penalties for inflicting cruel and unusual punishments on slaves. It also made provisions for basic entitlements of slaves to clothes, food and rudimentary education. However, the Act was somewhat eclectic in effect; it also prohibited marriages between slaves being sanctified by religious ceremony. Ultimately, the act would lead to abolitionism. The Act is sometimes portrayed as an example of extending basic human rights to slaves. Whilst that may be correct, it is also probable that the Act had considerably less altruistic purposes. Agitation amongst slaves was increasing in the region at the time, and slave rebellions were becoming increasingly frequent. Trying to moderate the conduct of the worst slave owners was partly a measure to control these outbreaks of violence. It suggested that the Act served an economic function; anticipating the abolition of the slave trade (which in fact subsequently happened pursuant to the Slave Trade Act 1807). It has been argued that the Act sought to preserve the well-being and encourage the breeding of existing slave populations to preserve the labour basis upon which the Caribbean's plantation economies were based. It does not appear that the provisions which prohibited cruel and unusual punishments were widely enforced. However, in at least one notable instance, the trial of Arthur Hodge for the murder of one of his slaves, the Act was cited obliquely. Hodge's counsel, at the bail hearing, had argued that \\"A Negro being property, it was no greater offense for his master to kill him than it would be to kill his dog,\\" a submission that was ridiculed by the prosecution, but, being unable to cite authority to refute it, made reference to the Act and averred that it was completely inconsistent with being entitled to kill slaves. Use of the term \\"cruel and unusual punishments\\", derived from the English Bill of Rights might have also been influenced by its inclusion in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution some ten years previously, whose text was well known to English- speaking jurists.

His stories were published in popular magazines such as Collier's, Esquire, Columbia, and Commonweal. The most popular of his novels were Dearly Beloved (1942), Dayspring (1945), and Moon Gaffney (1947). He was asked to turn John Steinbeck's script for Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat (1944) into a short story. This version was published in Collier's in 1943, with Steinbeck and Hitchcock both receiving writing credits. He is remembered primarily as the author of Dayspring and a friend of Ernest Hemingway. Early life Sylvester was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1908. His grandfather was Jeremiah Curtin, a folklorist who influenced W. B. Yeats's interest in Irish mythology. His father, Harry Sylvester, Sr., was heavily involved in politics during the 1920s and 30s, serving as a Republican in New York in a number of capacities. After graduating from Manual Training High School in Brooklyn, Sylvester went to Notre Dame in 1926. There, he played football for Knute Rockne. During his time as a undergraduate, he served a regular sports editor and contributor to the school's weekly newspaper, Scholastic. During college, he also worked as a lifeguard in New York which would prove influential for some of his early short stories. He graduated in 1930 with a degree in journalism. Soon after graduating from college, Sylvester found work as a correspondent for the New York Evening Post and a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune. Sylvester wrote mostly about sports, especially football and baseball. During this time he traveled to Florida to follow the Brooklyn Dodgers. In 1936, he wed Rita Ryall Davis of Manhattan. They had four children together, John, Anne, Joan, and Clare. Literary career 316x316pxIn 1933, Sylvester gave up a full-time job as a journalist in order to concentrate on his fiction writing. His first novel, Big Football Man, was released that same year. The novel, a bildungsroman, revolves around the young football star Sebastian as he navigates the complexities of college life. Sylvester drew upon his own experiences playing for Notre Dame for the story. Dearly Beloved, his second novel and the first of his religious trilogy, was published in 1942. This novel deals with issues of racism and economic inequality, looking particularly at the Catholic Church's role in navigating such societal issues. Set in Southern Maryland, Dearly Beloved is \\"about a small group of Jesuit priests doing what we might call missionary work among the hard-drinking, amoral, fiercely color-conscious poor whites, and the Negroes.\\" Sylvester conducted extensive research into the area, the Jesuits, and the concept of co-ops for this novel. He followed this up with a third novel in 1945, Dayspring, which follows the investigations of an atheist anthropologist named Spencer Bain. The story chronicles Bain's research into the Hermanos de Luz (or the Penitente Brotherhood) and his subsequent conversion to Catholicism through the process. Sylvester deals realistically with themes such as adultery and abortion in Dayspring, which earned the novel mixed reviews upon its publication. The story was inspired by his trips to New Mexico. Dayspring was Sylvester's first novel to attract international attention; the literary publishing house, Rich & Cowan, released an edition of the book in 1949. His fourth novel, Moon Gaffney, was published in 1947. Moon Gaffney's story centers on a young man torn between his political ambitions and his religious ideals. Sylvester dedicated Moon Gaffney to a group of \\"good Catholic radicals,\\" including John C. Cort and Dorothy Day. Like his novel, Dearly Beloved, Sylvester was accused of pushing anti-clerical views after publication. During his lifetime, Moon Gaffney was the most popular of his novels, to the point that the novel was translated into Polish by Maria Kłos- Gwizdalska and printed in 1955, with French and Italian translators also approaching Sylvester for permission to bring his work to Europe. Sylvester declined all translation requests, except for that of Klos-Gwizalska. The book was reprinted in 1976 by Arno Press, which briefly revived interest in Sylvester's work. While traveling and researching for his novels, Sylvester wrote short stories to support his wife and children. This sometimes meant laying aside his larger works, something that continually bothered Sylvester. He would later detail this problem in a speech, \\"Problems of the Catholic Writer,\\" which was later printed as an essay for the Atlantic Monthly (January 1948). In 1948, Sylvester arranged a collection of his short stories and published them under the title All Your Idols. According to the author's note, the book contains stories originally printed in various magazines including Collier’s, Esquire, Story magazine, Scribner’s magazine, Columbia magazine, Good Housekeeping, The Western Review (formerly the Rocky Mountain Review), and Commonweal. The collection received generally favorable reviews. Sylvester's final published novel, A Golden Girl, is set in Peru and is his least overtly religious work. Based upon his own travels to Latin America, the story follows a young American expatriate in Lima during the bullfight season, and the fallout he experiences after becoming romantically involved with a troubled young woman from New York. It was his most critically derided work. He was also a prolific writer of book reviews, publishing over 100 reviews for outlets such as Commonweal and the New York Times between 1931 and 1974. Later life The publication of this final novel coincided with the beginning stages of his divorce from Rita in 1951, as well as his official repudiation of the Catholic Church. Rita died in 1978. He formally renounced his membership in the Catholic church in 1954 and joined the Society of Friends. He remarried that same year and his second wife, Janet Hart Sylvester, joined the Quakers with Sylvester. He didn't publish a novel after 1950. But Sylvester did not completely give up writing; he took up work for the US Information Service for twenty years, retiring in 1971. During that time, he wrote scripts for the Voice of America radio broadcasts and regularly contributed to local newspapers. He spent the last 40 years of his life in the Washington, DC area. His wife, Janet, died on September 20, 1987. In letters to Cort, Sylvester expressed deep grief over the loss of Janet and the difficulty he had after her passing. Sylvester spent the last five years of his life at the Friends Nursing Home in Sandy Spring, Maryland. He died after a long battle with Parkinson's disease on September 26, 1993.  Legacy  Sylvester, though no longer a household name, knew many of the prominent writers of the 20th century. He was a friend and correspondent of Ernest Hemingway in the 1930s; several letters to him from Hemingway appear in the latter's Selected Letters. He also regularly exchanged letters with J. F. Powers and Richard T. Sullivan. By mid-century, he was considered to be a very promising writer in Catholic circles, but he was mostly known for his critical views of the Catholic hierarchy, earning him the ire of many. By the time of his death in 1993, he was largely forgotten. The University of New Mexico, University Libraries, Center for Southwest Research has a collection of bibliographic material and book reviews by and about Sylvester (and Willa Cather). However, his complete papers are housed in Georgetown University Library's Special Collections, and include correspondence, manuscripts and three unpublished novels, Watch in the Night, The Young Men, and The Youth (and Education) of Don Lorenzo. 217x217px  Novels  *Big Football Man (1933) *Dearly Beloved (1942) *Dayspring: A Novel (1945) ** U.K. printing by Rich & Cowan, London (1949) **Reprinted by Ignatius Press (2009) *Moon Gaffney (1947) **Reprinted by Arno Press (1976) **Wcześniej czy później, Polish translation (1955) *A Golden Girl (1950) 194x194px 193x193px The first edition of Moon Gaffney published in 1947 by Henry Holt and Co., with dust jacket illustration. 197x197px 196x196px  Short Stories  Sylvester estimated that he wrote \\"about 150 short stories\\" between 1930 and 1955.

The civil parish (CP) includes the hamlets of Upperton, River, and River Common. The land area of the CP is ; approximately 500 people lived in 227 households at the 2001 census. Upperton and Tillington are designated Conservation Areas. There are many old dwellings, including medieval timber framed houses, with one third of the buildings in the parish being grade II listed.Chichester District Council, Tillington Parish Plan 2006.

All Hallows Church with its unusual Scots crown tower is a landmark when approaching from Petworth, and is floodlit at night.A church near you It was painted by J. M. W. Turner and John Constable. The church, first recorded in 1100 was mostly rebuilt and enlarged between 1807 and 1837, but retains romanesque sculpture and a plain eight-sided twelfth century stone font.Corpus of romanesque sculpture Opposite the church is the historic Horseguards Inn, thought to get its name from the cavalry who stayed there overnight while escorting gold bullion from London to the navy at Portsmouth. History The first reference to Tillington is in a title deed of 960 , as Tullington, the farm or village founded by Tulla. Upperton (Upper Village) is first mentioned in 1191. Grittenham (Great Farm Enclosure), once a much larger settlement than today, is first mentioned in the Domesday Book, 1086, as Greteham, with 34 households, and resources including a mill. River (On the Slope) has also been called Treve through most of its history. Tillington itself was listed in the Domesday Book as in the ancient hundred of Easebourne as having 45 households: 21 villagers, 16 smallholders and 8 slaves; with woodland for pigs, ploughing land, meadows and a mill, it had a value to the lord of the manor of just over£8. During the 16th century a great deal of common grazing land east of Upperton was illegally enclosed to make a deer park for Petworth House causing impoverishment of the farmers of Upperton. This resulted in a long running legal case against the Earl of Northumberland, owner of Petworth, described by Peter Jerrome in his book Cloakbag and Common Purse. The \\"common purse\\" was a fighting fund raised by the tenants to fund legal action in the Chancery court; the \\"clokebagge well fraught with money\\" was a large bribe to the tenants' leader to drop the case, after previously having had him press ganged into the army and sent to fight \\"beyond seas\\" which probably meant in Ireland, which he survived. In 1861, the area of the Anglican parish was with a population of 908. Geology A sandstone ridge with an elevation of approximately runs east to west across the centre of the parish, from Upperton to River. The north facing scarp slope falls steeply to the low weald where the soils are a mix of Weald Clay with alluvial soils. Economy The northern part of the parish is well wooded, the farmland being a mix of pasture and arable. Ironstone deposits on the lower slopes of the escarpment have been quarried in the pre-industrial era leaving parts of River Common pitted and scarred, now overgrown by naturally regenerated broadleaved woodland. To the south of the sandstone ridge the land slopes gently down to the River Rother having very fertile free draining soils on greensand which are divided into large fields and mostly used for intensive vegetable production. Some of the upper slopes have recently been planted with grape vines. Wildlife Early Purple Orchid Acid sandy soils and neutral clay and loams provide a range of habitats, and there is some brookland adjoining the River Rother. There is no chalk. There is ancient grassland on River Common where glow-worms can be seen. Much of Petworth deer park with closely grazed ancient turf and numerous ant hills is within the parish boundary. The northern part of the parish has a diversity of small fields,hedges and woodlands supporting a wide range of species. Foxes, badgers, fallow deer and roe deer are plentiful. Muntjac deer are sometimes seen. Four species of reptile are present. Adders are found on the common and grass snakes throughout. Common lizards have been seen at River Common and Parkhurst Farm. Slow-worms are found in most places. Buzzards returned to the area several years ago and breed regularly. A full habitat survey of the parish is being undertaken. Sport and leisure Tillington cricket ground on the southern edge of Upperton has fine views of the South Downs. There is a modern sports pavilion, adjoining hard tennis courts and a children's play area. Just north of the church and pub, Tillington Village Hall is a well equipped venue for meetings, indoor activities and parties. Governance Tillington is governed by Tillington Parish Council. Council meetings are held every two months in Tillington Village Hall, normally on the last Monday evening of the month. The responsibilities include footpaths, the cricket ground and pavilion, tennis courts, children's play equipment and the assessment of planning applications. It has overall responsibility for the village hall, which is run by a management committee. The parish council has nine seats, with a four-year term, all uncontested in the May 2007 election. Three replacement councillors were co-opted. The next higher level of government is the district council. The parish of Tillington lies within the Petworth ward of Chichester District Council which returns two members to the district council. In parallel with the district is West Sussex County Council, with responsibility for Education, Libraries, Social Services, Civil Registration, Trading Standards and Transport. Elections for the County Council are held every four years. The UK Parliament constituency for Tillington is Arundel and South Downs. The Conservative Nick Herbert is the serving MP. At European level, Tillington is represented by the South-East region, which holds ten seats in the European Parliament. The June 2004 election returned four Conservatives, two Liberal Democrats, two UK Independence, one Labour and one Green. Gallery Some images of cavalry in the village.

VI, c.16) is a 1937 act of the Canadian parliament that ratified the Canadian cabinet's consent to His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, an act of the United Kingdom parliament that allowed the abdication of Edward VIII. This ratification was of symbolic value only, because under the Statute of Westminster 1931, the UK act was already part of Canadian law by virtue of the Canadian cabinet's prior request and consent. Background Edward VIII abdicated in order to marry Wallis Simpson after facing opposition from the governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions, including Canada's. Edward signed instruments of abdication on December 10, mailing one instrument, with advance notice by cable, to each Dominion; Canada's went to the Governor General, John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir. However, Edward was still king until Royal Assent was granted to His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, which was passed through the British Houses of Parliament on December 11, with no amendments. Under the terms of the Statute of Westminster 1931, the British parliament could pass legislation for a Dominion only at the request and with the approval of that Dominion's government. The Canadian government duly requested and gave its consent, via an Order in Council of the Privy Council of Canada. Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand did likewise. Edward as King-in- Council then issued an Order in his British Privy Council to authorize the inclusion of the Dominions in the Abdication Act.King Edward renounces the throne, The Guardian, December 1936 The South African parliament later passed His Majesty King Edward the Eighth's Abdication Act, 1937, backdating George VI's accession in South Africa to December 10, 1936. The Irish Free State did not incorporate the UK act but recognized the abdication in the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936. Canadian law The Canadian act ratified the changes to the rules of succession in Canada and assured consistency with the changes in the rules then in place in the United Kingdom and the other Dominions. The Canadian act was not legally required at the time, as the Canadian government's request and consent to His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 had already made it part of Canada's law and the Governor General had already proclaimed the Duke of York as King George VI. (Indeed, Royal Assent to the Canadian bill was granted in the name of George VI.) However, constitutional experts noted that \\"Whether necessary or not, it was clearly designed to demonstrate Canada's equality with Britain in the British Commonwealth and to display the Canadian aspect of the monarchy.\\" Under present Canadian law, the Canadian government cannot request and consent to any British act becoming part of Canadian law, under both the UK parliament's Canada Act, 1982 (which renounced the right in UK law) and Canadian parliament's Constitution Act, 1982 (which repealed the 1931 provision in Canada).

It is one of the longest Egyptian tales that has survived completed. The tale is about a peasant, Khun-Anup, who stumbles upon the property of the high steward, the noble Rensi son of Meru, guarded by its harsh overseer, Nemtynakht. It is set in the Ninth or Tenth Dynasty around Herakleopolis. This tale is described as an elaborate reflection on the connection – or disconnection – of ethical order and refined speech, as transliterated into refined writing. Story summary The story begins with a poor peasant, Khun- Anup, traveling to market with his donkeys heavily laden with goods to exchange for supplies for his family. While Khun-Anup was en route, Nemtynakht, a vassal of the high steward Rensi, notices the peasant approaching his lands and devises a scheme to steal Khun-Anup's donkeys and supplies. Nemtynakht tricks the peasant by placing a cloth on the narrow public path, where one side was bordered by the river and the other side were the private fields of Nemtynakht. His placing of the cloth on the path forces the peasant to either trample the cloth, step into the water, or take his donkeys over Nemtynakht's fields in order to continue his journey. As Khun- Anup is appealing to Nemtynakht's sense of reason in blocking his path with the cloth, one of Khun-Anup's donkeys eats a bite of barley, and Nemtynakht uses this as a justification to take Khun-Anup's donkeys and goods. When Khun- Anup complains this punishment is unfair, Nemtynakht beats him. Khun-Anup cries out for justice, and Nemtynakht threatens the peasant with death if he dares to complain. Khun-Anup does not accept this injustice and continues to appeal to Nemtynakht for ten days. Failing to receive justice from Nemtynakht, Khun-Anup seeks out the high steward, the noble Rensi son of Meru, and presents his case. Rensi brings the peasant's case to the magistrates, who dismiss the case as merely being a matter of a peasant at odds with a landowner, but Rensi does not relay this information to the peasant. Rensi brings the story of the wronged peasant before the pharaoh, Nebkaure (who is believed to be Nebkaure KhetyAlan Gardiner, Egypt of the Pharaohs. An introduction, Oxford University Press, 1961, p. 112.William C. Hayes, in The Cambridge Ancient History, vol 1, part 2, 1971 (2008), Cambridge University Press, , p. 465.), telling him how elegantly the peasant speaks. Intrigued by the report of a peasant who speaks so elegantly, the pharaoh instructs Rensi to not respond to the peasant's pleas, so that the peasant would continue to make his elegant speeches and they could be written down for the pharaoh. The pharaoh orders Rensi to feed the peasant and his family while the peasant continues to plead his case, further instructing Rensi not to let the peasant know he was providing the food. For nine days Khun-Anup complimented the high steward Rensi and begged for justice. After nine days of speeches, Khun-Anup threatened suicide. After sensing that he was being ignored, Khun-Anup insulted Rensi and was punished with a beating. After one last speech, the discouraged peasant left, but Rensi sent for him and ordered him to return. But rather than being punished for his insolence, the peasant was given justice. Rensi, after reading Khun-Anup's last speech, was impressed and ordered the donkeys and the goods to be returned to Khun-Anup and the peasant to be compensated with all the property of Nemtynakht, making Nemtynakht as poor as Khun-Anup had been.  Characters  = Khun-anup = The poor peasant, Khun-Anup, lives with his wife, Marye, and their children in an oasis around the Nile Delta in Egypt. He goes on a journey taking with him his donkeys and a variety of goods to market so he can bring food and supplies back to his family. Along his journey, Nemtynakht, a vassal to the high steward Rensi, notices Khun-Anup's supply-laden donkeys and devises a plan to cheat Khun-Anup of his possessions. Khun-Anup does not accept this injustice and appeals to the vassal for ten days before he seeks out the high steward, the noble Rensi son of Meru. Khun-Anup's eloquent plea for justice surprises Rensi and he informs the pharaoh about the peasant's surprising gift with words. Intrigued by Rensi's report of a peasant so eloquent, the pharaoh orders Rensi to deny justice to the peasant so that he will continue to plea for justice and his eloquent words can be written down. Khun-Anup presents his case for justice nine times before his eloquence and persistence is rewarded and he is given all of Nemtynakht's property. = Rensi son of Meru = The noble Rensi son of Meru is the high steward of Pharaoh Nebkaure. The peasant Khun-Anup appeals to Rensi when he does not receive justice from Nemtynakht. Rensi is so surprised at the eloquence of the peasant's speech that he takes Khun-Anup's case before the Pharaoh. The Pharaoh orders Rensi to deny the peasant's pleas for justice in order that his eloquent words can be written down. Rensi hears Khun-Anup's petitions for justice nine times before the Pharaoh allows Rensi to provide justice for the eloquent peasant. = Nemtynakht = A greedy vassal to the high steward Rensi, Nemtynakht notices the peasant Khun-Anup's supply-laden donkeys and devises a trap that will provide him with a reason for taking Khun-Anup's donkeys and goods. Nemtynakht confiscates Khun-Anup's goods and donkeys and then beats Khun-Anup when he argues Nemtynakht is behaving unjustly. Khun-Anup cries out for justice but Nemtynakht tells him no one will take the word of a peasant over his own. In the end, Nemtynakht is proven wrong because Khun-Anup ultimately receives justice when Nemtynakht is ordered to return all of the peasant's property and to also give the peasant all of Nemtynakht's property. = Nebkaure = He is his Majesty of the Dual King Nebkaure, the justified. “The justified” is a standard epithet of the deceased. Nebkaure is a king of the tenth dynasty of Heracleopolis, ca. 2050 BCE. He is a pharaoh (king) of Egypt during the First Intermediate Period. When told of the eloquent language spoken by the peasant, Khun-Anup, Nebkaure is intrigued. He orders his head steward Rensi the son of Meru, to refuse to respond to Khun-Anup's petitions so that the peasant will continue to eloquently make his case for justice and his words can be written down and brought to Nebkaure. He further instructs Rensi to feed Khun-Anup and to send food to his family during the time he is being forced to plead his case but Khun-Anup is not to know Rensi is providing for the peasant and his family. At his ninth petition, Khun-Anup threatens suicide, therefore, Rensi brings him before Nebkaure and has all nine of Khun-Anup's petitions read aloud to Nebkaure. His Majesty Nebkaure the justified allows Rensi to determine Khun-Anup's justice.  Themes  = Ma'at = Ma'at is the ancient Egyptian law based on the idea of harmony and balance and allows for the social hierarchy to be prevalent in citizen's everyday lives. This theme is present throughout the poem, especially in Khun-Anup's speeches about what justice means to his situation. Ma'at is also exemplified in the courts of the story because justice and social hierarchy is fully dependent on the judge and how he interprets ma'at in relation to the trials.  Textual history  = Origin = While we do have a somewhat cohesive narrative for The Eloquent Peasant, to our current knowledge, a narrative for the entirety of the poem does not exist. The tale is a compilation of four incomplete manuscripts that have some conflict in overlapping sections. The names of people and places seem to differ amongst the four different pieces. Despite this, there is an understanding that they are all versions of the same story. Like most stories, it is implied that different people told the story in different ways - leading to some discrepancies in written versions. = Author = Information concerning the author (or authors) of the text is minimal. It is assumed that the author(s) were more than likely male(s), but even that information may not be correct. The themes and intellectual points in the story make it evident that the author - if it was one person - was a part of the educated class. He or she was literate enough to put the story in hieroglyphics. The story was likely not originally told in the form of poetry, but was later translated. = Time period = The poem was written around the same time as \\"The Tale of Sinuhe\\", during Egypt's Classical Age. This time period was said to have produced some of the greatest works of literature and art. The wealthy and well educated Egyptians focused greatly on these aspects, as well as entertainment. The Eloquent Peasant would have been considered a generous amount of both. The poem was also one of the first recorded texts that focused on the lives of people other than the kings or the gods. The story reflected ideals of Egypt at the time among the common people. It was extremely popular. = The Middle Kingdom = While the story of The Eloquent Peasant was set in the ninth and tenth dynasties, it is generally accepted that the poem itself was written during the Middle Kingdom. While many scholars are divided on which dynasties are encompassed in the Middle Kingdom, the most commonly accepted dynasties are from the end of the eleventh dynasty through the middle of the thirteenth dynasty (2040-1782 BCE). There are claims that The Eloquent Peasant was one of the few texts that highlighted some of the concepts of Egyptian law during the Middle Kingdom dynasties.  Influence on arts and literature  The Eloquent Peasant shows the modern reader a glimpse of how justice in crime might have been attained in ancient Egyptian culture. While it is natural to assume that guilt may be determined by the hierarchy of the time, The Eloquent Peasant shows us that you could speak your mind and possibly change the verdict cast upon you. The theme of justice featured so prominently in The Eloquent Peasant might have been a precursor to themes of justice in later works.

St. Maxent was born in Longwy, Meurthe-et-Moselle, in Lorraine, France. In 1747 he moved to New Orleans, the French colonial capital of Lower Louisiana. He enlisted in the French Army and in 1749 married the wealthy Elizabeth La Roche (1761-1825), with whom he had six children, including Maximilien François de St. Maxent, who became a colonial governor of West Florida, Elizabeth de Saint Maxent, wife of governor Luis de Unzaga, and Felicite de Saint Maxent, wife of governor Bernardo de Galvez.Family tree of Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent and Elizabeth LaRoche, retrieved on 6 June 2017. He used the dowry to open a business on Conti Street to supply fur traders. In 1753 he was promoted to colonel and commandant of the Louisiana Regiment, by Governor Louis de Billouart Kerlerec. He was to distinguish himself in battles defending Louisiana against incursions by the British and Chickasaws in the French and Indian War. Founding of St. Louis In 1755 Kerlerec gave St. Maxent exclusive rights to deal with Native Americans west of the Mississippi River. St. Maxent's most ambitious effort was the formation of Maxent, Laclède & Company in which he gave 25 percent ownership to Pierre Laclède. In 1763 LaClede selected a site on a bluff above the west side of the Mississippi River, just south of the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, for a settlement that was to be called Saint Louis. According to legend, work on clearing the site began on Saint Valentine's Day of 1764. St. Louis was founded before news arrived that in the Treaty of Paris (1763), which ended the French and Indian War, Spain would take over France's possessions on the west of the Mississippi River and that the British were to take over French lands on the east side of the river (officially administering what was to be Native American territories). After the news arrived, French colonists on the east side of the river moved to the west side, at St. Louis. Rebellion of 1768 St. Maxent, whose fortune was tied to France, was to have his loyalties severely tested in the transition from French to Spanish control. St. Maxent was one of the first Frenchmen to pledge his allegiance to the new Spanish governor, Antonio de Ulloa, and Ulloa was named godfather of one of St. Maxent's daughters. St. Maxent entered into contracts to supply Spanish frigates. When the Creole and German settlers around New Orleans resisted Spanish rule in the Rebellion of 1768, they imprisoned St. Maxent at his plantation from October 25 to 29, 1768, releasing him after Ulloa was forced out of the city to return to Spain. In January 1769, St. Maxent thwarted the plotters' efforts to enlist Native Americans in the planned resistance to any Spanish attempt to reclaim New Orleans. In May 1769, the partnership with Laclede was dissolved, with Laclede buying the St. Louis facilities for 80,000 livres and the first payment due in June 1771. In August 1769, Alejandro O'Reilly restored Spanish authority in New Orleans, putting down the rebellion and executing five ringleaders while imprisoning five others. O'Relly abolished the Superior Council, which had governed Louisiana during the French period, replacing it with the Spanish cabildo and replacing the French laws with the Spanish code. O'Reilly gave St. Maxent a new patent for the fur business, for the firm St. Maxent and Ranson. This firm, which rivaled Laclède's, was to contribute to Laclède's declining fortunes in St. Louis. St. Maxent's first daughter, Marie-Elizabeth de St. Maxent, married the next Spanish governor Luis de Unzaga, in 1775. His second daughter Marie-Félicité de St. Maxent d'Estrehan, a wealthy widow, married Unzaga's successor, Bernardo de Gálvez. Galvez was to succeed his father later as Viceroy of New Spain. During this period it is believed that St. Maxent was the richest man in the entire territory. He built a series of lavish homes. In the Great New Orleans Fire of 1788 which destroyed most of the city's buildings, St. Maxent was officially commended by the Spanish for opening his home to many refugees and for selling supplies to the Spanish at the same price as before the fire. American Revolution During the American Revolutionary War Spain sided with the French and United States against the British and St. Maxent was placed in charge of the militia (but not Spanish regulars), which saw action in the Gulf Coast campaign, including the Capture of Fort Bute, the Battle of Baton Rouge (1779) (which resulted in the capture of both Fort New Richmond and Fort Panmure (future Natchez, Mississippi), the Battle of Fort Charlotte (1780), and ultimately the Siege of Pensacola (1781). For his actions, he was named Commandant of the Militia of Louisiana, Lt. Governor of the Provinces of Louisiana and West Florida, Captain-General of the new Bureau of Indian Affairs of Louisiana and West Florida. In 1782, he traveled to Spain to get concessions from King Carlos III, including permission to import slaves without paying duty. As part of the negotiation, he agreed not to export specie (gold bars). While returning to Louisiana in 1782, his two ships and crew were captured by the British and sent to Kingston, Jamaica, where St. Maxent was held under house arrest and his men put in prison. They obtained lenient treatment through bribes. The revolutionary war ended with the Treaty of Paris (1783), and St. Maxent's fortunes quickly soured. One of the British benefactors was arrested in Havana, St. Maxent was implicated in smuggling specie (gold), and the Spanish revoked his titles and embargoed his property. Adding to his woes, his New Orleans warehouse was destroyed in the Great New Orleans Fire (1788), and in 1789 he was again arrested by Governor Esteban Rodríguez Miró. St. Maxent eventually cleared himself of the charges, but the process tied him up for the rest of his life. The next Spanish governor, Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet, called him back to military duty to help build Fort San Felipe. Carondelet recommended that he be promoted to Brigadier General, but he died in 1794. References  Bibliography  *Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent: The Spanish-Frenchman of New Orleans by James J.

He came from a middle-class family and had diabetes. A high school science fair project on the gravitational fields of non-spherical bodies won him a college scholarship to Caltech and a job at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he wrote the software used to navigate Voyagers 1 and 2. A member of the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society, an Official Editor of the comic book APA CAPA-alpha, and an early member of gaming fandom, he came into contact with a number of science fiction writers, notably Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, who, in their books, credit Dan Alderson with ideas that inspired some of their science fiction, notably the Alderson drive and the Alderson disk. As \\"Dan Forrester\\" he is a prominent character in Lucifer's Hammer. Alderson did not write science fiction himself, but for his own amusement created the imaginary planet of Wibblefubwilda, a planet where everyone gets his heart's desire. He died at an early age from complications of diabetes. He is remembered as a patron saint of the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society, which honored his memory with a parking space reserved in his name in front of their clubhouse until they moved to a new location without dedicated parking.

It was formerly known by its German language name Kalthof as first a suburb of and then a quarter of Königsberg, Germany. History Barracks of the Pionier-Bataillon Fürst Radziwill (Ostpreußisches) Nr. 1 Kalthof was founded by the Teutonic Knights as an outwork (Vorwerk) estate on the eastern approach to medieval Königsberg. Its farmland extended as far west as Rossgarten's marketplace, the Roßgärter Markt; the farmland was gradually developed by Rossgarten and Neue Sorge over centuries. A copper mill was located nearby in 1416.Gause I, p. 53 The estate was worked by farmers from nearby villages.Gause I, p. 57 In the late 17th century Kalthof, Lawsken, and Spittelhof were possessed by Johann von Hille, commandant of Fort Friedrichsburg.Gause I, p. 485 The 1,100 morgen Devau Revuefeld just east of Kalthof was the oldest large training ground of the Prussian Army, with exercises held annually since 1717.Gause II, p. 43 King Frederick the Great did not want any ceremonies during his first visit to Königsberg after his accession. Instead, a large revue of East Prussia's troops was held on 20 April 1740 instead.Gause II, p. 133 In 1893 Kalthof contained barracks for two pioneer battalions of the Prussian I Corps,Gause II, p. 629 the Pionier- Bataillon Fürst Radziwill (Ostpreußisches) Nr. 1, formerly of Danzig, and the Samländisches Pionier-Bataillon Nr. 18, which recruited from Samland. In 1905 the estate's final owner, Berthold Kleist (1848-1932), sold Kalthof to Königsberg, allowing it to be incorporated into the city. At that time it had a population of 2,020.Gause II, p. 648 Kalthof was connected to central Königsberg by the street Labiauer Straße (formerly Königsallee), which met Königstraße at King's Gate. Between Kalthof and the Königsberg fortifications were several cemeteries laid out during the 19th century. To the northwest was the Pferderennbahn, or horse racing track, in Carolinenhof. The Devau airfield was northeast of Kalthof. Farther east was Lauth, while Liep was to the southeast. Within Kalthof was the Kalthöfer Park or Kleist-Park, named after Berthold Kleist. The park contained a stone inscribed with \\"Non omnis moriar\\" by Horace. The quarter also contained the Ostdeutsche Brotfabrik, a bread factory, and the Terletzki/Goebels organ company. The parish church was Kalthof Church. Königsberg was transferred to Soviet control in 1945 after World War II. Königsberg was subsequently renamed to Kaliningrad and Kalthof to Rizhskoye.

The CI became deeply involved with black activists such as Steve Biko, and was banned by the state in 1977. History The Christian Institute of Southern Africa was founded in 1963 by 280 Christians (Hexham 1980) that included Albert Geyser, Ben Marais, D. C. S. Oosthuizen, and John de Gruchy. Factors that contributed to the founding was the need to continue dialogue after the disastrous conclusion of the 1960 Cottesloe Consultation, the last time that all South African churches met until 1990. Reformed members of the CI could also critique official Dutch Reformed policies, which included support for apartheid. The 1963 South Transvaal Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church had forbidden unofficial comments that were not submitted through official channels (Maritz 2003:56). The first national director of the Christian Institute (CI) was Dr C F Beyers Naudé. John de Gruchy, a Congregationalist minister and later an academic at the University of Cape Town, was a founder member. CI's constitution was drawn up by two Johannesburg advocates, Colin Kinghorn and Johann Kriegler (later a founding justice of the Constitutional Court of South Africa). Pro Veritate, a newsletter produced by Naudé, was adopted as the mouthpiece of the CI. Brian Brown was CI's Administrative Director, Cedric Mayson edited Pro Veritate, while Theo Kotze (1920-July 4, 2003 ) directed the work of the CI in Cape Town. (De Gruchy 2005:104,109) . Peter Randall led the 'Study Project on Christianity in an Apartheid Society' that was jointly sponsored by the CI and the South African Council of Churches.

It was also the sixteenth episode of the show's third season. It was written by Brian A. Alexander and directed by Larry Shaw. It originally aired March 4, 2007. Plot This is a male-focused episode which is narrated by Rex Van de Kamp. Edie Britt gets a visit from her ex-husband, Charles McLain (though he is not shown), and their 9-year-old son, Travers. Charles wants Edie to take care of Travers while Charles is in Africa for a month with Doctors Without Borders. Edie does not want to sit her son, but Travers wants to stay with her so she promises to take care of him. Edie's neighbor Carlos Solis brings a woman named Kelly to Mike Delfino’s and his house. As they are about to have sex, Carlos notices Travers playing outside by himself, in the dark. Carlos brings Travers inside, which causes Kelly to leave. The end of the episode implies that Carlos is reminded of his desire for a child by this incident. Victor Lang, a rich man in his midforties, tells his chauffeur to rear-end Gabrielle Marquez’s Aston Martin DB9 Convertible on purpose so he and Gabrielle can meet. The next day, Gabrielle goes to Victor’s office and finds him being interviewed and photographed. He is running for mayor of Fairview. She agrees to go out with him, and though they have a pleasant date, she does not think he is the right man for her. Still, he is seen confidently telling a waiter he was going to marry \\"that girl\\". Familyman Tom Scavo makes a nice romantic gesture for his wife Lynette involving a horse and carriage ride for their anniversary. Naturally, things go awry, but by the end of the episode, they have reaffirmed their love for one another. Danielle Van de Kamp discovers she is pregnant and it is believed by her family that Edie Britt's nephew Austin McCann is the father. Danielle's stepfather Orson Hodge wants Austin to leave town, and he decides that Danielle will go somewhere else to give birth to the baby and then give it up for adoption; the cover story being that she is taking a semester abroad. Austin writes his ex- girlfriend Julie Mayer a heartfelt letter and she agrees to take him back, not knowing about Danielle's pregnancy. Austin tells Julie he has to leave for a while for \\"a family thing\\". Mike Delfino returns the engagement ring he had planned on giving to his ex-girlfriend Susan Mayer and the jeweler notes the inscription on the inside dedicated to Susan. At that moment Susan walks in with her engagement ring from her new boyfriend and fiancé Ian Hainsworth; she wants to have the ring resized as Ian bought the wrong size. The jeweler takes the ring that Mike was returning and uses it to size Susan's finger—and it fits. A poker game with all the husbands and bachelors from Wisteria Lane leads to a face-off between Ian and Mike. After selling back the ring he is able to repay Ian for the lawyer he hired for him. However, with Mike quickly losing out on money, Ian offers a new stake saying that if Mike wins the hand he can tell Susan whatever he likes, but if Ian wins Mike cannot utter a word. Mike has 3 kings and 2 queens, and so believes he will win. He loses the hand and cannot tell Susan that he was planning to propose the night he was hit by the car. Ratings This episode had 18.3 million viewers on its original airing. Cast Although credited, Preston Scavo (Brent Kinsman), Porter Scavo (Shane Kinsman), and Parker Scavo (Zane Huett) do not appear in this episode. Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross) appears only briefly in this episode, although Cross’ stand-in Carolyn Howard was used for the cold open scene. This is the first episode of the show that Marcia Cross did not appear in. Series continuity This is also the first episode not narrated by Mary Alice Young, though her voice does appear in the “Previously on Desperate Housewives” narrative. This was narrated by Rex Van de Kamp instead. This is also Josh Henderson's last episode. Title reference The episode title, My Husband, the Pig is a song taken (cut from the original production) from the Stephen Sondheim musical, A Little Night Music. The title is something of a misnomer in more ways than one, as only two of the men seen in the episode (Tom and Orson) are currently married and, except for Austin, all appear genuinely considerate in this episode.

Heuser (born August 29, 1942) is an American Professor of Biophysics in the department of Cell Biology and Physiology at the Washington University School of Medicine as well as a Professor at the Institute for Integrated Cell-Matieral Sciences (iCeMS) at Kyoto University. Heuser created quick- freeze deep-etch electron microscopy (a variant of cell unroofing), a pioneering technique that lets biologists take detailed pictures of fleeting events inside living cells. For decades, Heuser has used this technique to capture details of the molecular mechanisms that underlie many basic biological activities, including nerve cell signal transmission, muscle contraction, and most recently, the fusion of viruses with cells during the spread of infection. He compares quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy to using a stroboscopic flash to freeze the action in a photograph. To make it possible to image the frozen sample with an electron microscope, Heuser adds an ultra-thin film of metallic platinum that molds snugly against the sample's frozen surface contours. He and others in his lab have worked to make the equipment and procedures necessary for this process available to researchers around the world. Currently Heuser has patents pending on Washington University's behalf for even more advanced versions of his quick-freezing machines.

They exist in several different isoforms that can be homo- or heterodimeric. (free full text) The number of characterized ligands in the TGFβ superfamily far exceeds the number of known receptors, suggesting the promiscuity that exists between the ligand and receptor interactions. TGFβ is a growth factor and cytokine involved in paracrine signalling and can be found in many different tissue types, including brain, heart, kidney, liver, bone, and testes. Over- expression of TGFβ can induce renal fibrosis, causing kidney disease, as well as diabetes, and ultimately end-stage renal disease. Recent developments have found that, using certain types of protein antagonists against TGFβ receptors, can halt and in some cases reverse the effects of renal fibrosis. Three TGFβ superfamily receptors specific for TGFβ, the TGFβ receptors, can be distinguished by their structural and functional properties. TGFβR1 (ALK5) and TGFβR2 have similar ligand-binding affinities and can be distinguished from each other only by peptide mapping. Both TGFβR1 and TGFβR2 have a high affinity for TGFβ1 and low affinity for TGFβ2. TGFβR3 (β-glycan) has a high affinity for both homodimeric TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 and in addition the heterodimer TGF-β1.2.

It can be used to create groups of processes whose members send messages to each other. JGroups enables developers to create reliable multipoint (multicast) applications where reliability is a deployment issue. JGroups also relieves the application developer from implementing this logic themselves. This saves significant development time and allows for the application to be deployed in different environments without having to change code. Features * Group creation and deletion. Group members can be spread across LANs or WANs * Joining and leaving of groups * Membership detection and notification about joined/left/crashed members * Detection and removal of crashed members * Sending and receiving of member-to-group messages (point-to-multipoint) * Sending and receiving of member-to-member messages (point-to-point)  Code sample  This code below shows how a simple chat application could be written using JGroups: public class Chat extends ReceiverAdapter { JChannel channel; public void viewAccepted(View new_view) { System.out.println(\\"** view: \\" + new_view); } public void receive(Message msg) { System.out.printf(\\"from %s: %s \\", msg.getSource(), msg.getObject()); } private void start(String props, String name) throws Exception { channel = new JChannel(props).setName(name) .setReceiver(this).connect(\\"ChatCluster\\"); eventLoop(); channel.close(); } private void eventLoop() { BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); while (true) { try { System.out.print(\\"> \\"); System.out.flush(); String line = in.readLine().toLowerCase(); Message msg = new Message(null, line); channel.send(msg); } catch(Exception e) } } public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { String props = \\"udp.xml\\"; String name = null; for (int i=0; i < args.length; i++) { if (args[i].equals(\\"-props\\")) { props = args[++i]; continue; } if (args[i].equals(\\"-name\\")) { name = args[++i]; continue; } System.out.println(\\"Chat [-props XML config] [-name name]\\"); return; } new Chat().start(props, name); } } In start(), a JChannel is created from an XML configuration (e.g. udp.xml). The channel is the endpoint for joining a cluster. Next, the Receiver is set, which means that 2 callbacks are going to be invoked: * viewAccepted(View v) whenever a new member joins, or an existing member leaves the cluster * receive(Message msg) when a message from some other cluster member is received Then, the channel joins cluster \\"ChatCluster\\". From now, messages can be sent and received, plus a new view (including this member) will be installed in all cluster members (including the newly joined member). Anything typed in the main loop results in the creation of a Message that's sent to all cluster members, including the sender. Instances of the chat application can be run in the same process, on the same box, on different hosts in the local network, on hosts in different networks, or in the cloud. The code remains the same; the only thing that needs to be changed is the configuration. For example, in a local network, IP multicasting might be used. When IP multicasting is disabled, TCP can be used as transport. When run in the cloud, TCP plus a cloud discovery protocol would be used and so on... Flexible protocol stack The most powerful feature of JGroups is its flexible protocol stack, which allows developers to adapt it to exactly match their application requirements and network characteristics. The benefit of this is that you only pay for what you use. By mixing and matching protocols, various differing application requirements can be satisfied. JGroups comes with a number of protocols (but anyone can write their own), for example * Transport protocols: UDP (IP Multicast), TCP * Fragmentation of large messages * Discovery protocols to discover the initial membership for a joining node * Reliable unicast and multicast message transmission. Lost messages are retransmitted * Failure detection: crashed members are excluded from the membership * Ordering protocols: Fifo, Total Order (sequencer or token based) * Membership and notification of joined or crashed members * Network partition (split brain) detection and merging * Flow control * Encryption and authentication (including SASL support) * Compression Building blocks Building blocks are classes layered over JGroups channels, which provide higher-level abstractions such as * RPCs to individual or all cluster nodes * Distributed caches * Distributed locks * Distributed atomic counters * Distributed task execution  External links  * The JGroups website * A simple request distribution example in JGroups * A slideshow presenting JGroups Category:Computer networking Category:Java (programming language) software ","title":"JGroups"},{"id":"9506546","text":"Northeastern University is a university in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

As a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, TGF-α is a mitogenic polypeptide. The protein becomes activated when binding to receptors capable of protein kinase activity for cellular signaling. TGF-α is a transforming growth factor that is a ligand for the epidermal growth factor receptor, which activates a signaling pathway for cell proliferation, differentiation and development. This protein may act as either a transmembrane-bound ligand or a soluble ligand. This gene has been associated with many types of cancers, and it may also be involved in some cases of cleft lip/palate. Synthesis TGF-α is synthesized internally as part of a 160 (human) or 159 (rat) amino acid transmembrane precursor.Ferrer, I.; Alcantara, S.; Ballabriga, J.; Olive, M.; Blanco, R.; Rivera, R.; Carmona, M.; Berruezo, M.; Pitarch, S.; Planas, A. Transforming growth factor- α (TGF-α) and epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R) immunoreactivity in normal and pathologic brain. Prog. Neurobiol. 1996, 49, 99. The precursor is composed of an extracellular domain containing a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, 50 amino acids of TGF-α, and a 35-residue-long cytoplasmic domain. In its smallest form, TGF-α has six cysteines linked together via three disulfide bridges. Collectively, all members of the EGF/TGF-α family share this structure. The protein, however, is not directly related to TGF-β. Limited success has resulted from attempts to synthesize of a reductant molecule to TGF-α that displays a similar biological profile. =Synthesis in the stomach= In the stomach, TGF-α is manufactured within the normal gastric mucosa.Coffey, R.; Gangarosa, L.; Damstrup, L.; Dempsey, P. Basic actions of transforming growth factor- α and related peptides. Eur. J. Gastroen. Hepat. 1995, 7, 923. TGF-α has been shown to inhibit gastric acid secretion.  Function  TGF-α can be produced in macrophages, brain cells, and keratinocytes. TGF-α induces epithelial development. Considering that TGF-α is a member of the EGF family, the biological actions of TGF-α and EGF are similar. For instance, TGF-α and EGF bind to the same receptor. When TGF-α binds to EGFR it can initiate multiple cell proliferation events. Cell proliferation events that involve TGF-α bound to EGFR include wound healing and embryogenesis. TGF-α is also involved in tumerogenesis and believed to promote angiogenesis. TGF-α has also been shown to stimulate neural cell proliferation in the adult injured brain. Receptor A 170-kDa glycosylated protein known as the EGF receptor binds to TGF-α allowing the polypeptide to function in various signaling pathways. The EGF receptor is characterized by having an extracellular domain that has numerous amino acid motifs. EGFR is essential for a single transmembrane domain, an intracellular domain (containing tyrosine kinase activity), and ligand recognition. As a membrane anchored-growth factor, TGF-α can be cleaved from an integral membrane glycoprotein via a protease. Soluble forms of TGF-α resulting from the cleavage have the capacity to activate EGFR. EGFR can be activated from a membrane-anchored growth factor as well. When TGF-α binds to EGFR it dimerizes triggering phosphorylation of a protein-tyrosine kinase. The activity of protein-tyrosine kinase causes an autophosphorylation to occur among several tyrosine residues within EGFR, influencing activation and signaling of other proteins that interact in many signal transduction pathways. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway upon binding to TGF-α.  Animal studies  In an animal model of Parkinson's disease where dopaminergic neurons have been damaged by 6-hydroxydopamine, infusion of TGF-α into the brain caused an increase in the number of neuronal precursor cells. However TGF-α treatment did not result in neurogenesis dopaminergic neurons.  Human studies =Neuroendocrine system= The EGF/TGF-α family has been shown to regulate luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) through a glial-neuronal interactive process. Produced in hypothalamic astrocytes, TGF-α indirectly stimulates LHRH release through various intermediates. As a result, TGF-α is a physiological component essential to the initiation process of female puberty. =Suprachiasmatic nucleus= TGF-α has also been observed to be highly expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (5). This finding suggests a role for EGFR signaling in the regulation of CLOCK and circadian rhythms within the SCN.Hao, H.; Schwaber, J. Epidermal growth factor receptor induced Erk phosphorylation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Brain Res. 2006, 1088, 45. Similar studies have shown that when injected into the third ventricle TGF-α can suppress circadian locomotor behavior along with drinking or eating activities. =Tumors= This protein shows potential use as a prognostic biomarker in various tumors, like gastric carcinoma. or melanoma has been suggested. Elevated TGF-α is associated with Menetrier's disease, a precancerous condition of the stomach.  Interactions  TGF alpha has been shown to interact with GORASP1 and GORASP2.

It merged with Taylor Walker and Ind Coope in 1961 to form Allied Breweries. The brewery remained in operation until 1981, after which production transferred to Allied's Burton upon Trent brewery; some former employees later set up the Aston Manor Brewery. History The brewery was founded by Joseph Ansell, a hop merchant and maltster, in 1858 at Aston Cross on the site of several artesian wells (the later HP Sauce factory was adjacent). William Ansell joined his father in partnership in 1867. From 1877 the company was known as Joseph Ansell and Sons, and became a limited liability company, Joseph Ansell & Sons Ltd, in 1889. In June 1901 it became a registered company called Ansells Brewery Ltd. The company was valued at over £750,000 and included 388 licensed houses. Ansells grew by acquiring several other smaller local brewers including Rushtons with 100 licensed houses in 1923, Lucas of Leamington with 124 licensed houses (1928) and Holt's Brewery with 250 licensed houses (1934). Holt's logo, a Red Squirrel seen in side profile, was subsequently adopted by Ansells to identify its own beers. An unopened bottle of Ansells Silver Jubilee Strong Ale, from 1977, commemorating the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II In 1961, Ansells merged with Taylor Walker & Co and Ind, Coope & Co to form Allied Breweries. At the time, Ansells had an estate of 1,088 primarily managed houses in Birmingham and the West Midlands. Throughout the 1960s and 70s, the brewery was prone to strike action by its workers. By the late 1970s the Aston Brewery was struggling to remain profitable. In 1981, as a cost-saving measure, management attempted to introduce a four-day working week. This resulted in strike action. Allied Breweries subsequently closed the brewery, and 700 jobs were lost, with 300 workers redeployed elsewhere in the company. The brewery was demolished site is now occupied by a car showroom. Production was subsequently moved to Allied's Burton upon Trent brewery, and some former staff set up the Aston Manor Brewery. Ansells Mild and Best Bitter are currently produced for Allied's successor Carlsberg by JW Lees. Cask conditioned Ansell's Mild was discontinued in 2012.

He served in the upper house of Congress as senator representing the State of Morelos (2006-2012). Personal life and education Graco Ramírez holds a bachelor's degree in law from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). He is the son of a member of the Mexican armed forces.http://morelos.gob.mx/?q=Biografia_Gobernador He also is part of the group known as Toby's Club which is a group of prominent people that control most of the important projects in the state, the groups has: notaries, artists, judges, businessmen. Political career On several occasions, Ramirez stated that he was a leader of the student movement that culminated in the Tlatelolco massacre of October 2, 1968; at least one leader has challenged this assertion. Graco Ramírez began his political career as an Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) member; he served as president of the PRI in Tabasco. He then became a founder and member of the Socialist Worker's Party, the Mexican Socialist Party and the Party of the Democratic Revolution. As the leader of the Morelos state legislature in 1995, Graco Ramirez led the first of several marches against then-governor Jorge Carrillo Olea because of alleged ties to drug trafficking and kidnapping. Carrillo was forced to resign in 1998. Graco Ramírez has served more than one term in the lower house of Congress. In 2006 he was elected senator, hence he served in the upper house of Congress during the LX and LXI Legislatures (2006-2012). As senator, he promoted laws to allow independent candidates and citizen initiatives and consultations. Graco Ramirez was elected Governor of Morelos in 2012. As governor, Ramirez was known as a progressive who supported women's rights and scholarships for needy students. In an effort to combat high crime rates in the state, Graco initiated a police reform program called Mando Unico wherein all the state and local police forces were united under a single command. Despite a promising start, both poverty and crime increased in the state; the \\"Mando Unico\\" in particular was accused of numerous human rights violations, and it was seen as a political organism. In 2016 an audit of the state university, UAEM revealed a shortfall of millions of pesos. Governor Ramirez and Alejandro Vera, the rector of the university, mutually accused one another of deviating funds for other purposes. Faced with the loss of their pensions, faculty and staff went on strike; a student march was supported by the Catholic bishop, Ramon Castro Castro. Then, following the earthquake of September 19, 2017, Graco and his wife were accused of seizing much-needed humanitarian aid destined for earthquake victims. By February, 2018, the man once considered a leading candidate for President of Mexico was the least popular governor in the country. In a controversial move, Graco chose his stepson, Rodrigo Gayosso as PRD candidate for governor in 2018. Swept up in Andrés Manuel López Obrador's wave, Cuernavaca mayor Cuauhtémoc Blanco of the Juntos Haremos Historia (Together we will make history) coalition won the election. Criminal accusations On February 13, 2019, Cuauhtemoc Blanco formally accused Graco Ramirez; his wife, Elena Cepeda; his stepson, Rodrigo Gayosso; and a notary public, Javier Barona; for the crimes of organized crime, operations with resources of illicit origin, and tax fraud. On September 27, 2019, the government of the state of Morelos formally solicited a political trial against Ramirez due to his refusal to provide the Attorney General and the Electoral Commission sufficient funds with which to operate. Although the Electoral Commission requested MXN $35 million for the 2018 election, Ramirez provided on MXN $18 million. El Universal reports that Ramirez is being investigated for deviating funds of MXN $100 million related to concerts by Sting, Emmanuel, and Mijares. There are receipts that show Sting was paid USD $2,000,000 for a concert, but he had been paid on USD $900,000 for a similar concert in Viña del Mar, Chile. Blanco alleged in September 2020 that he had proof that Graco and Alberto Capella Ibarra had an agreement with organized crime while Ramírez Garrido Abreu was governor.

In the book Sr. Schuth examines regional and diocesan differences by surveying over nine hundred priests and interviewing nearly a hundred more. They offer information about spiritual and community leadership, staffing, and parish organization in the present situation. Using these suggestions, the book tries to discern what contributes to the building of vital and dynamic parishes, and what causes indifference and dissolution. The book highlights what is successful in maintaining the strength of these small parishes and what practices lead to their diminishment. The book is written not only as an aid to those who find themselves pastoring several congregations, but also seminary educators, diocesan leaders, and congregations. = Articles = Besides these books, Schuth has written numerous book reviews: *\\"Three Phases of Their Life and Ministry\\" on Experiences of Priests Ordained for Five to Nine Years by Dean Hoge (April 2006) *an introduction to \\"Catholic Priesthood: Formation and Human Development\\" by Gerald Coleman, S.S., Liguori Publications (2006) *An Affinity of Little Hours by Nancy Klein Maguire, “And then there was One.” America 194/12 (April 3, 2006): 30-32. *Orders and Ministry: Leadership in the World Church by Kenan Osborne (Orbis Books, Summer 2006) in America 195/2 (July 17–24, 2006): 21-22. *The Collar: A Year of Striving and Faith Inside a Catholic Seminary by Jonathan Englert (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2006) forthcoming in Journal of the American Catholic Historical Society Articles: *“The Researcher’s Role in the Church,” Origins 35/20 (October 27, 2005): 325-329 *“Character and Assessment of Learning for Religious Vocation: Interview Study of Roman Catholic Students and Faculty,” Theological Education 40/2 (Summer 2005) 1-45 *“A View of the State of the Priesthood in the United States,” Louvain Studies 30/1 (May 2005) 8-24.

Ramesses apparently made no distinctions between the offspring of his first two principal wives, Nefertari and Isetnofret.Joyce Tyldesley: Ramesses, Egypt's Greatest Pharaoh Both queens' firstborn sons and first few daughters had statues at the entrance of the Greater Abu Simbel temple, although only Nefertari's children were depicted in the smaller temple, dedicated to her.Dodson & Hilton, p.167 Other than Nefertari and Isetnofret, Ramesses had six more great royal wives during his reign – his own daughters Bintanath, Meritamen, Nebettawy and Henutmire (who, according to another theory was his sister), and two daughters of Hattusili III, King of Hatti. Except the first Hittite princess Maathorneferure and possibly Bintanath, none are known to have borne children to the pharaoh. The first eight sons of Ramses: Amunherkhepeshef, Ramesses, Pareherwenemef, Khaemwaset, Montuherkhepeshef, Nebenkharu, Meryamun and Sethemwia. Temple Wadi es-Sebua A procession of the first nine daughters of Ramses: Bintanath, Baketmut, Nefertari, Meritamen, Nebettawy, Isetnofret, Henuttawy, Werenro and Nedjemmut. Most of his children are known to us from processions like this. The first few children of Ramesses usually appear in the same order on depictions. Lists of princes and princesses were found in the Ramesseum, Luxor, Wadi es-Sebua and Abydos. Some names are known to us from ostraka, tombs and other sources. The sons of Ramses appear on depictions of battles and triumphs–such as the Battle of Kadesh and the siege of the Syrian city of Dapur–already early in his reign (Years 5 and 10, respectively), thus it is likely that several of them were born before he ascended to the throne. Many of his sons were buried in the tomb KV5. Ramesses' efforts to have his children depicted on several of his monuments are in contradiction with the earlier tradition of keeping royal children, especially boys in the background unless they held important official titles. This was probably caused by the fact that his family was not of royal origin and he wanted to stress their royal status.Dodson–Hilton, pp.164–165. Sons # Amunherkhepeshef (“Amun Is with His Strong Arm”), firstborn son of Nefertari; crown prince until his death in Year 26.Dodson & Hilton, p.170 He is likely to be the same person as Seth-her-khepeshef or Sethirkopshef. # Ramesses (“Born of Rê”), eldest son of Isetnofret, crown prince between Years 25 and 50.Dodson & Hilton, p.173 # Pareherwenemef (“Re Is with His Right Arm”), Nefertari's second son. Appears on depictions of the triumph after the Battle of Kadesh and in the smaller Abu-Simbel temple. He was never crown prince; it is likely he predeceased his elder brothers. # Khaemweset (“He who appears/appeared in Thebes”), Isetnofret's second son, \\"the first Egyptologist\\", crown prince until about the 55th year.Dodson & Hilton, p.171 # Mentu-her-khepeshef or Montuhirkhopshef or Mentuherwenemef (“Menthu Is with His Strong/Right Arm”) was mentioned on a stela from Bubastis.

He changed his name from Amunemwia to Sethemwia around the same time when his eldest brother changed it. # Sethi was also present at Kadesh and Dapur. He was buried in KV5 – where two of his canopic jars were found – around Year 53. On his funerary equipment his name is spelled Sutiy. He might have been identical with another Sethi, mentioned on an ostrakon which is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.Dodson & Hilton, p.174 # Setepenre (“Chosen of Re”) was present at Dapur too. # Meryre (“Beloved of Re”) was the son of Nefertari.

A Book of the Dead, which was probably his, is now in Florence. # Unknown # Mentuenheqau (\\"Mentu is with the rulers\\") The following sons of Ramses are known from various sources other than lists: * Astarteherwenemef (“Astarte Is with His Right Arm”) is shown on a stone block originally from the Ramesseum, reused in Medinet Habu. His name shows Asian influence like that of Bintanath and Mahiranath. * Geregtawy (“Peace of the Two Lands”) is known from a stone block, from the Ramesseum, reused in Medinet Habu. * Merymontu (“Beloved of Menthu”) was depicted in Wadi es-Sebua and Abydos. * Neben[…] is mentioned on an ostrakon in Cairo. * [Ramesses-…]pare is the 20th on the Abydos procession of princes, which shows a slightl different order of them. * Ramesses-Maatptah (“Justice of Ptah”) is only known from a letter, in which the palace servant Meryotef rebukes him. * Ramesses-Meretmire (\\"Loving like Re\\") is the 48th on the Wadi es-Sebua procession. * Ramesses-Meryamun-Nebweben is known from his coffin's inscriptions. * Ramesses-Meryastarte (“Beloved of Astarte”) is the 26th in the Abydos procession. * Ramesses-Merymaat (“Beloved of Maat”) is the 25th in the Abydos procession. * Ramesses-Meryseth (“Beloved of Seth”) is known from a stone block from the Ramesseum, reused in Medinet Habu. He is the 23rd in the Abydos procession and is named on a stela, a door lintel and on a doorjamb. * Ramesses-Paitnetjer (\\"The priest\\") is known from a Cairo ostrakon. * Ramesses-Siatum (“Son of Atum”) is the 19th in the Abydos procession. * Ramesses-Sikhepri (\\"Son of Khepri\\") is the 24th in the Abydos procession. * (Ramesses)-Userkhepesh (“Strong of Arm”) is the 22nd in the Abydos procession. * Ramesses-Userpehti (\\"Strong of strength\\") is probably a son of Ramesses II. He is mentioned on a Memphis statue and on a plaque. * Seshnesuen[…] and Sethemhir[…] are mentioned on a Cairo ostrakon. * [Seth]emnakht (\\"Seth as the champion\\") and Shepsemiunu (\\"The noble one in Heliopolis\\") are known from stone blocks from the Ramesseum, reused in Medinet Habu. [Seth]emnakht is also mentioned on a doorway. * Wermaa[…] is mentioned on a Cairo ostrakon. Daughters It is harder to determine the birth order of the daughters than that of the sons. The first ten of them usually appear in the same order. Many of the princesses are known to us only from Abydos and from ostrakons. The six eldest princesses have statues at the entrance of the Greater Abu Simbel temple. # Bintanath (“Daughter of Anath”), daughter of Isetnofret, later Great Royal Wife. # Baketmut (“Handmaid of Mut”) # Nefertari, possibly the wife of Amun-her-khepeshef.Dodson & Hilton, p.168 # Meritamen (“Beloved of Amun”) is Nefertari's daughter, later Great Royal Wife. She is probably the best known of Ramesses' daughters. # Nebettawy (“Lady of the Two Lands”) later became Great Royal Wife.Dodson & Hilton, pp.167 & 172 # Isetnofret (“The beautiful Isis”) is also known from a letter in which two singers inquire after her health. It is possible she was identical with Merenptah's wife Isetnofret, but it is also possible that Merenptah's wife was Khaemwaset's daughter, also called Isetnofret. # Henuttawy (“Mistress of the Two Lands”) was Nefertari's daughter. # Werenro # Nedjemmut (“Mut is Sweet”) # Pypuy is likely to be identical with a lady who was the daughter of Iwy and was reburied with a group of 18th dynasty princesses in Sheikh Abd el-Qurna.

He remained with that church until 1967 when he left for America. Upon arriving in America, Clavier joined the Anglican Orthodox Church, staying with it until he returned to England and the Catholic Episcopal Church there. In 1969 Clavier returned to the United States once again, seemingly to stay. He became a priest under James Hardin George of the American Episcopal Church.

Signing in the 2000 summer transfer window, Jesuli would serve his most successful stint at RC Celta de Vigo, scoring seven league goals in his third year as the Galician team qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time ever.

In 1936 Florence was elected as the Nationalist member for Subiaco in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, and in 1949 became the first Australian woman to attain full cabinet rank when she was made Minister for Health (having been previously an \\"Honorary\\" Minister for Supply and Shipping since 1947). Two years later she also became a member of the Select Committee on the Educational System in 1938. Florence was a political women and did much work with what she believed in. In 1939 she organized a campaign to go against free birth-control clinics. On 3 September 1941, she went against her own party, at the time, though unsuccessfully moved for the abolition of the death penalty. On 1 April 1947 she was met with an honorary minister in the McLarty-Watts Liberal-Country Party government and on 5 January 1948 Florence became the honorary minister for supply and shipping. She retained these portfolios until the government was defeated in February 1953. Influenced by her experiences with undernourished children in London, she sponsored the Free Milk and Nutritional Council, and, as minister, introduced a free-milk scheme for Western Australian schoolchildren. Cardell- Oliver brought the State to the forefront of anti-tuberculosis campaigns by legislating for compulsory chest X-ray examinations. She later retired from her place as a Liberal Party She was, also a delegate to the British Commonwealth League, London. She was a women's activist in Western Australia between 1936 and 1956 and a party organizer from 1936 to 1956.

A tarp tent is a tarpaulin, a plastic or nylon sheet, used in place of a tent. It is usually rigged with poles, tent pegs, and guy lines. Ultralight backpackers use tarp tents because they are lightweight compared to other backpacking shelters. In its simplest form it is floorless with open ends, as a fly or with the sides attached to the ground. It can also be set up as a loue with two adjacent sides by the ground and the opposite corner as highest point, giving more protection from wind and reflecting heat from an optional fire in front of the open side. A tarp tent is commonly lighter and cheaper than a tent and easier to set up. However, because it is more open, it does not provide as much protection from rain, snow, wind, or cold as a tent does. It provides no protection from insects. More sophisticated tarp tents are now manufactured or homemade with such things as bug screening and storm flaps on the ends and even floors and vents. According to Harvey Manning in his book Backpacking One Step at a Time (The REI Press Seattle), \\"The term 'tarp-tent' as used here denotes a broad category which at one boundary is nothing more than a shaped tarp and at the other end verges on a 'true' tent. The common characteristic is a single wall, in most cases, waterproof.\\" In Mountaineering the Freedom of the Hills (4th ed. The Mountaineers, Seattle, WA) it says, \\"A tarp tent is both light in weight and low in cost, and offers adequate shelter from all but extreme weather in lowland forests and among subalpine trees.\\" Tarp tents are frequently made of silnylon material because it is lightweight, strong, and waterproof.

Initially an office for lifetime, assigned by the Sovereign, the High Sheriff became annually appointed from the Provisions of Oxford in 1258. Besides his judicial importance, he had ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. History The first (High) Shrievalties were established before the Norman Conquest in 1066 and date back to Saxon times. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. Despite however that the office retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in a county. County Tipperary was a liberty administered by the Earls of Ormond, who thereby appointed the Sheriff, until it was extinguished as part of the second Duke's attainder for supporting the Jacobite rising of 1715. It then became a normal county under the direct control of the King. In Tipperary and in four of the counties of the province of Connaught the office ceased to exist with the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922.

In solution, this dimer quickly reverts to the blue monomer. Reactions It can be used as a spin trap. This molecule traps unstable free radicals to form stable paramagnetic nitroxide radicals that can be detected and analyzed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. It is particularly useful for trapping carbon-centered tyrosyl radicals. It has also been used in organic chemistry as electrophile to transform sulfones into aldehydes.

There were no upward-compatible machines or computer architectures with multiple, differing implementations. Programs written for one machine would run on no other kind, even other kinds from the same company. This was not a major drawback then because no large body of software had been developed to run on computers, so starting programming from scratch was not seen as a large barrier. The design freedom of the time was very important because designers were very constrained by the cost of electronics, and only starting to explore how a computer could best be organized. Some of the basic features introduced during this period included index registers (on the Ferranti Mark 1), a return address saving instruction (UNIVAC I), immediate operands (IBM 704), and detecting invalid operations (IBM 650). By the end of the 1950s, commercial builders had developed factory-constructed, truck-deliverable computers. The most widely installed computer was the IBM 650, which used drum memory onto which programs were loaded using either paper punched tape or punched cards. Some very high-end machines also included core memory which provided higher speeds. Hard disks were also starting to grow popular. A computer is an automatic abacus. The type of number system affects the way it works. In the early 1950s, most computers were built for specific numerical processing tasks, and many machines used decimal numbers as their basic number system; that is, the mathematical functions of the machines worked in base-10 instead of base-2 as is common today. These were not merely binary coded decimal (BCD). Most machines had ten vacuum tubes per digit in each processor register. Some early Soviet computer designers implemented systems based on ternary logic; that is, a bit could have three states: +1, 0, or -1, corresponding to positive, zero, or negative voltage. An early project for the U.S. Air Force, BINAC attempted to make a lightweight, simple computer by using binary arithmetic. It deeply impressed the industry. As late as 1970, major computer languages were unable to standardize their numeric behavior because decimal computers had groups of users too large to alienate. Even when designers used a binary system, they still had many odd ideas. Some used sign- magnitude arithmetic (-1 = 10001), or ones' complement (-1 = 11110), rather than modern two's complement arithmetic (-1 = 11111). Most computers used six- bit character sets because they adequately encoded Hollerith punched cards. It was a major revelation to designers of this period to realize that the data word should be a multiple of the character size. They began to design computers with 12-, 24- and 36-bit data words (e.g., see the TX-2). In this era, Grosch's law dominated computer design: computer cost increased as the square of its speed.  1960s: Computer revolution and CISC  One major problem with early computers was that a program for one would work on no others. Computer companies found that their customers had little reason to remain loyal to a given brand, as the next computer they bought would be incompatible anyway. At that point, the only concerns were usually price and performance. In 1962, IBM tried a new approach to designing computers. The plan was to make a family of computers that could all run the same software, but with different performances, and at different prices. As users' needs grew, they could move up to larger computers, and still keep all of their investment in programs, data and storage media. To do this, they designed one reference computer named System/360 (S/360). This was a virtual computer, a reference instruction set, and abilities that all machines in the family would support. To provide different classes of machines, each computer in the family would use more or less hardware emulation, and more or less microprogram emulation, to create a machine able to run the full S/360 instruction set. For instance, a low-end machine could include a very simple processor for low cost. However this would require the use of a larger microcode emulator to provide the rest of the instruction set, which would slow it down. A high-end machine would use a much more complex processor that could directly process more of the S/360 design, thus running a much simpler and faster emulator. IBM chose consciously to make the reference instruction set quite complex, and very capable. Even though the computer was complex, its control store holding the microprogram would stay relatively small, and could be made with very fast memory. Another important effect was that one instruction could describe quite a complex sequence of operations. Thus the computers would generally have to fetch fewer instructions from the main memory, which could be made slower, smaller and less costly for a given mix of speed and price. As the S/360 was to be a successor to both scientific machines like the 7090 and data processing machines like the 1401, it needed a design that could reasonably support all forms of processing. Hence the instruction set was designed to manipulate simple binary numbers, and text, scientific floating-point (similar to the numbers used in a calculator), and the binary coded decimal arithmetic needed by accounting systems. Almost all following computers included these innovations in some form. This basic set of features is now called complex instruction set computing (CISC, pronounced \\"sisk\\"), a term not invented until many years later, when reduced instruction set computing (RISC) began to get market share. In many CISCs, an instruction could access either registers or memory, usually in several different ways. This made the CISCs easier to program, because a programmer could remember only thirty to a hundred instructions, and a set of three to ten addressing modes rather than thousands of distinct instructions. This was called an orthogonal instruction set. The PDP-11 and Motorola 68000 architecture are examples of nearly orthogonal instruction sets. There was also the BUNCH (Burroughs, UNIVAC, NCR, Control Data Corporation, and Honeywell) that competed against IBM at this time; however, IBM dominated the era with S/360. The Burroughs Corporation (which later merged with Sperry/Univac to form Unisys) offered an alternative to S/360 with their Burroughs large systems B5000 series. In 1961, the B5000 had virtual memory, symmetric multiprocessing, a multiprogramming operating system (Master Control Program (MCP)), written in ALGOL 60, and the industry's first recursive-descent compilers as early as 1963.  Late 1960s–early 1970s: LSI and microprocessors  The MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor), also known as the MOS transistor, was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, and demonstrated in 1960. This led to the development of the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC), proposed by Kahng in 1961, and fabricated by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA in 1962.https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/metal- oxide-semiconductor-mos-transistor-demonstrated/ With its high scalability, and much lower power consumption and higher density than bipolar junction transistors, the MOSFET made it possible to build high-density integrated circuits. Advances in MOS integrated circuit technology led to the development of large-scale integration (LSI) chips in the late 1960s and eventually the invention of the microprocessor in the early 1970s. In the 1960s, the development of electronic calculators, electronic clocks, the Apollo guidance computer, and Minuteman missile, helped make MOS integrated circuits economical and practical. In the late 1960s, the first calculator and clock chips began to show that very small computers might be possible with large- scale integration (LSI). This culminated in the invention of the microprocessor, a single-chip CPU. The Intel 4004, released in 1971, was the first commercial microprocessor. The origins of the 4004 date back to the \\"Busicom Project\\",Federico Faggin, The Making of the First Microprocessor, IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine, Winter 2009, IEEE Xplore which began at Japanese calculator company Busicom in April 1968, when engineer Masatoshi Shima was tasked with designing a special-purpose LSI chipset, along with his supervisor Tadashi Tanba, for use in the Busicom 141-PF desktop calculator with integrated printer.Masatoshi Shima, IEEE His initial design consisted of seven LSI chips, including a three-chip CPU. His design included arithmetic units (adders), multiplier units, registers, read-only memory, and a macro- instruction set to control a decimal computer system. Busicom then wanted a general-purpose LSI chipset, for not only desktop calculators, but also other equipment such as a teller machine, cash register and billing machine. Shima thus began work on a general-purpose LSI chipset in late 1968. Sharp engineer Tadashi Sasaki, who also became involved with its development, conceived of a single-chip microprocessor in 1968, when he discussed the concept at a brainstorming meeting that was held in Japan. Sasaki attributes the basic invention to break the calculator chipset into four parts with ROM (4001), RAM (4002), shift registers (4003) and CPU (4004) to an unnamed woman, a software engineering researcher from Nara Women's College, who was present at the meeting. Sasaki then had his first meeting with Robert Noyce from Intel in 1968, and presented the woman's four-division chipset concept to Intel and Busicom. Busicom approached the American company Intel for manufacturing help in 1969. Intel, which primarily manufactured memory at the time, had facilities to manufacture the high density silicon gate MOS chip Busicom required. Shima went to Intel in June 1969 to present his design proposal. Due to Intel lacking logic engineers to understand the logic schematics or circuit engineers to convert them, Intel asked Shima to simplify the logic. Intel wanted a single-chip CPU design, influenced by Sharp's Tadashi Sasaki who presented the concept to Busicom and Intel in 1968. The single-chip microprocessor design was then formulated by Intel's Marcian \\"Ted\\" Hoff in 1969, simplifying Shima's initial design down to four chips, including a single-chip CPU. Due to Hoff's formulation lacking key details, Shima came up with his own ideas to find solutions for its implementation. Shima was responsible for adding a 10-bit static shift register to make it useful as a printer's buffer and keyboard interface, many improvements in the instruction set, making the RAM organization suitable for a calculator, the memory address information transfer, the key program in an area of performance and program capacity, the functional specification, decimal computer idea, software, desktop calculator logic, real-time I/O control, and data exchange instruction between the accumulator and general purpose register. Hoff and Shima eventually realized the 4-bit microprocessor concept together, with the help of Intel's Stanley Mazor to interpret the ideas of Shima and Hoff. The specifications of the four chips were developed over a period of a few months in 1969, between an Intel team led by Hoff and a Busicom team led by Shima. In late 1969, Shima returned to Japan. After that, Intel had done no further work on the project until early 1970. Shima returned to Intel in early 1970, and found that no further work had been done on the 4004 since he left, and that Hoff had moved on to other projects. Only a week before Shima had returned to Intel, Federico Faggin had joined Intel and become the project leader. After Shima explained the project to Faggin, they worked together to design the 4004. Thus, the chief designers of the chip were Faggin who created the design methodology and the silicon-based chip design, Hoff who formulated the architecture before moving on to other projects, and Shima who produced the initial Busicom design and then assisted in the development of the final Intel design. The 4004 was first introduced in Japan, as the microprocessor for the Busicom 141-PF calculator, in March 1971. In North America, the first public mention of the 4004 was an advertisement in the November 15, 1971 edition of Electronic News. NEC released the μPD707 and μPD708, a two-chip 4-bit CPU, in 1971. They were followed by NEC's first single-chip microprocessor, the μPD700, in April 1972. It was a prototype for the μCOM-4 (μPD751), released in April 1973, combining the μPD707 and μPD708 into a single microprocessor. In 1973, Toshiba released the TLCS-12, the first 12-bit microprocessor.  1970s: Microprocessor revolution  Intel 4004 microprocessor. The first commercial microprocessor, the binary coded decimal (BCD) based Intel 4004, was released by Busicom and Intel in 1971. In March 1972, Intel introduced a microprocessor with an 8-bit architecture, the 8008, an integrated pMOS logic re- implementation of the transistor–transistor logic (TTL) based Datapoint 2200 CPU. 4004 designers Federico Faggin and Masatoshi Shima went on to design its successor, the Intel 8080, a slightly more mini computer-like microprocessor, largely based on customer feedback on the limited 8008. Much like the 8008, it was used for applications such as terminals, printers, cash registers and industrial robots. However, the more able 8080 also became the original target CPU for an early de facto standard personal computer operating system called CP/M and was used for such demanding control tasks as cruise missiles, and many other uses. Released in 1974, the 8080 became one of the first really widespread microprocessors. By the mid-1970s, the use of integrated circuits in computers was common. The decade was marked by market upheavals caused by the shrinking price of transistors. It became possible to put an entire CPU on one printed circuit board. The result was that minicomputers, usually with 16-bit words, and 4K to 64K of memory, became common. CISCs were believed to be the most powerful types of computers, because their microcode was small and could be stored in very high-speed memory. The CISC architecture also addressed the semantic gap as it was then perceived. This was a defined distance between the machine language, and the higher level programming languages used to program a machine. It was felt that compilers could do a better job with a richer instruction set. Custom CISCs were commonly constructed using bit slice computer logic such as the AMD 2900 chips, with custom microcode. A bit slice component is a piece of an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), register file or microsequencer. Most bit-slice integrated circuits were 4-bits wide. By the early 1970s, the PDP-11 was developed, arguably the most advanced small computer of its day. Almost immediately, wider-word CISCs were introduced, the 32-bit VAX and 36-bit PDP-10. IBM continued to make large, fast computers. However, the definition of large and fast now meant more than a megabyte of RAM, clock speeds near one megahertz, and tens of megabytes of disk drives. IBM's System 370 was a version of the 360 tweaked to run virtual computing environments. The virtual computer was developed to reduce the chances of an unrecoverable software failure. The Burroughs large systems (B5000, B6000, B7000) series reached its largest market share. It was a stack computer whose OS was programmed in a dialect of Algol. All these different developments competed for market share. The first single-chip 16-bit microprocessor was introduced in 1975. Panafacom, a conglomerate formed by Japanese companies Fujitsu, Fuji Electric, and Matsushita, introduced the MN1610, a commercial 16-bit microprocessor.PANAFACOM Lkit-16, Information Processing Society of Japan According to Fujitsu, it was \\"the world's first 16-bit microcomputer on a single chip\\". The Intel 8080 was the basis for the 16-bit Intel 8086, which is a direct ancestor to today's ubiquitous x86 family (including Pentium and Core i7). Every instruction of the 8080 has a direct equivalent in the large x86 instruction set, although the opcode values are different in the latter.  Early 1980s–1990s: Lessons of RISC  In the early 1980s, researchers at UC Berkeley and IBM both discovered that most computer language compilers and interpreters used only a small subset of the instructions of complex instruction set computing (CISC). Much of the power of the CPU was being ignored in real-world use. They realized that by making the computer simpler and less orthogonal, they could make it faster and less costly at the same time. At the same time, CPU calculation became faster in relation to the time for needed memory accesses. Designers also experimented with using large sets of internal registers. The goal was to cache intermediate results in the registers under the control of the compiler. This also reduced the number of addressing modes and orthogonality. The computer designs based on this theory were called reduced instruction set computing (RISC). RISCs usually had larger numbers of registers, accessed by simpler instructions, with a few instructions specifically to load and store data to memory. The result was a very simple core CPU running at very high speed, supporting the sorts of operations the compilers were using anyway. A common variant on the RISC design employs the Harvard architecture, versus Von Neumann architecture or stored program architecture common to most other designs. In a Harvard Architecture machine, the program and data occupy separate memory devices and can be accessed simultaneously. In Von Neumann machines, the data and programs are mixed in one memory device, requiring sequential accessing which produces the so-called Von Neumann bottleneck. One downside to the RISC design was that the programs that run on them tend to be larger. This is because compilers must generate longer sequences of the simpler instructions to perform the same results. Since these instructions must be loaded from memory anyway, the larger code offsets some of the RISC design's fast memory handling. In the early 1990s, engineers at Japan's Hitachi found ways to compress the reduced instruction sets so they fit in even smaller memory systems than CISCs. Such compression schemes were used for the instruction set of their SuperH series of microprocessors, introduced in 1992. The SuperH instruction set was later adapted for ARM architecture's Thumb instruction set. In applications that do not need to run older binary software, compressed RISCs are growing to dominate sales. Another approach to RISCs was the minimal instruction set computer (MISC), niladic, or zero- operand instruction set. This approach realized that most space in an instruction was used to identify the operands of the instruction. These machines placed the operands on a push-down (last-in, first out) stack. The instruction set was supplemented with a few instructions to fetch and store memory. Most used simple caching to provide extremely fast RISC machines, with very compact code. Another benefit was that the interrupt latencies were very small, smaller than most CISC machines (a rare trait in RISC machines). The Burroughs large systems architecture used this approach. The B5000 was designed in 1961, long before the term RISC was invented. The architecture puts six 8-bit instructions in a 48-bit word, and was a precursor to very long instruction word (VLIW) design (see below: 1990 to today). The Burroughs architecture was one of the inspirations for Charles H. Moore's programming language Forth, which in turn inspired his later MISC chip designs. For example, his f20 cores had 31 5-bit instructions, which fit four to a 20-bit word. RISC chips now dominate the market for 32-bit embedded systems. Smaller RISC chips are even growing common in the cost-sensitive 8-bit embedded-system market. The main market for RISC CPUs has been systems that need low power or small size. Even some CISC processors (based on architectures that were created before RISC grew dominant), such as newer x86 processors, translate instructions internally into a RISC-like instruction set. These numbers may surprise many, because the market is perceived as desktop computers. x86 designs dominate desktop and notebook computer sales, but such computers are only a tiny fraction of the computers now sold. Most people in industrialised countries own more computers in embedded systems in their car and house, than on their desks.  Mid-to-late 1980s: Exploiting instruction level parallelism  In the mid-to-late 1980s, designers began using a technique termed instruction pipelining, in which the processor works on multiple instructions in different stages of completion. For example, the processor can retrieve the operands for the next instruction while calculating the result of the current one. Modern CPUs may use over a dozen such stages. (Pipelining was originally developed in the late 1950s by International Business Machines (IBM) on their 7030 (Stretch) mainframe computer.) Minimal instruction set computers (MISC) can execute instructions in one cycle with no need for pipelining. A similar idea, introduced only a few years later, was to execute multiple instructions in parallel on separate arithmetic logic units (ALUs). Instead of operating on only one instruction at a time, the CPU will look for several similar instructions that do not depend on each other, and execute them in parallel. This approach is called superscalar processor design. Such methods are limited by the degree of instruction level parallelism (ILP), the number of non- dependent instructions in the program code. Some programs can run very well on superscalar processors due to their inherent high ILP, notably graphics. However, more general problems have far less ILP, thus lowering the possible speedups from these methods. Branching is one major culprit. For example, a program may add two numbers and branch to a different code segment if the number is bigger than a third number. In this case, even if the branch operation is sent to the second ALU for processing, it still must wait for the results from the addition. It thus runs no faster than if there was only one ALU. The most common solution for this type of problem is to use a type of branch prediction. To further the efficiency of multiple functional units which are available in superscalar designs, operand register dependencies were found to be another limiting factor. To minimize these dependencies, out-of- order execution of instructions was introduced. In such a scheme, the instruction results which complete out-of-order must be re-ordered in program order by the processor for the program to be restartable after an exception. Out-of-order execution was the main advance of the computer industry during the 1990s. A similar concept is speculative execution, where instructions from one direction of a branch (the predicted direction) are executed before the branch direction is known. When the branch direction is known, the predicted direction and the actual direction are compared. If the predicted direction was correct, the speculatively executed instructions and their results are kept; if it was incorrect, these instructions and their results are erased. Speculative execution, coupled with an accurate branch predictor, gives a large performance gain. These advances, which were originally developed from research for RISC-style designs, allow modern CISC processors to execute twelve or more instructions per clock cycle, when traditional CISC designs could take twelve or more cycles to execute one instruction. The resulting instruction scheduling logic of these processors is large, complex and difficult to verify. Further, higher complexity needs more transistors, raising power consumption and heat. In these, RISC is superior because the instructions are simpler, have less interdependence, and make superscalar implementations easier. However, as Intel has demonstrated, the concepts can be applied to a complex instruction set computing (CISC) design, given enough time and money.  1990 to today: Looking forward  =VLIW and EPIC= The instruction scheduling logic that makes a superscalar processor is boolean logic. In the early 1990s, a significant innovation was to realize that the coordination of a multi-ALU computer could be moved into the compiler, the software that translates a programmer's instructions into machine-level instructions. This type of computer is called a very long instruction word (VLIW) computer. Scheduling instructions statically in the compiler (versus scheduling dynamically in the processor) can reduce CPU complexity. This can improve performance, and reduce heat and cost. Unfortunately, the compiler lacks accurate knowledge of runtime scheduling issues. Merely changing the CPU core frequency multiplier will have an effect on scheduling. Operation of the program, as determined by input data, will have major effects on scheduling. To overcome these severe problems, a VLIW system may be enhanced by adding the normal dynamic scheduling, losing some of the VLIW advantages. Static scheduling in the compiler also assumes that dynamically generated code will be uncommon. Before the creation of Java and the Java virtual machine, this was true. It was reasonable to assume that slow compiles would only affect software developers. Now, with just-in-time compilation (JIT) virtual machines being used for many languages, slow code generation affects users also. There were several unsuccessful attempts to commercialize VLIW. The basic problem is that a VLIW computer does not scale to different price and performance points, as a dynamically scheduled computer can. Another issue is that compiler design for VLIW computers is very difficult, and compilers, as of 2005, often emit suboptimal code for these platforms. Also, VLIW computers optimise for throughput, not low latency, so they were unattractive to engineers designing controllers and other computers embedded in machinery. The embedded systems markets had often pioneered other computer improvements by providing a large market unconcerned about compatibility with older software. In January 2000, Transmeta Corporation took the novel step of placing a compiler in the central processing unit, and making the compiler translate from a reference byte code (in their case, x86 instructions) to an internal VLIW instruction set. This method combines the hardware simplicity, low power and speed of VLIW RISC with the compact main memory system and software reverse-compatibility provided by popular CISC. Intel's Itanium chip is based on what they call an explicitly parallel instruction computing (EPIC) design. This design supposedly provides the VLIW advantage of increased instruction throughput. However, it avoids some of the issues of scaling and complexity, by explicitly providing in each bundle of instructions information concerning their dependencies. This information is calculated by the compiler, as it would be in a VLIW design. The early versions are also backward-compatible with newer x86 software by means of an on-chip emulator mode. Integer performance was disappointing and despite improvements, sales in volume markets continue to be low. =Multi- threading= Current designs work best when the computer is running only one program. However, nearly all modern operating systems allow running multiple programs together. For the CPU to change over and do work on another program needs costly context switching. In contrast, multi-threaded CPUs can handle instructions from multiple programs at once. To do this, such CPUs include several sets of registers. When a context switch occurs, the contents of the working registers are simply copied into one of a set of registers for this purpose. Such designs often include thousands of registers instead of hundreds as in a typical design. On the downside, registers tend to be somewhat costly in chip space needed to implement them. This chip space might be used otherwise for some other purpose. Intel calls this technology \\"hyperthreading\\" and offers two threads per core in its current Core i3, Core i7 and Core i9 Desktop lineup (as well as in its Core i3, Core i5 and Core i7 Mobile lineup), as well as offering up to four threads per core in high-end Xeon Phi processors. =Multi-core= Multi-core CPUs are typically multiple CPU cores on the same die, connected to each other via a shared L2 or L3 cache, an on- die bus, or an on-die crossbar switch. All the CPU cores on the die share interconnect components with which to interface to other processors and the rest of the system. These components may include a front-side bus interface, a memory controller to interface with dynamic random access memory (DRAM), a cache coherent link to other processors, and a non-coherent link to the southbridge and I/O devices. The terms multi-core and microprocessor unit (MPU) have come into general use for one die having multiple CPU cores. Intelligent RAM One way to work around the Von Neumann bottleneck is to mix a processor and DRAM all on one chip. * The Berkeley IRAM Project * eDRAM * Computational RAM * Memristor =Reconfigurable logic= Another track of development is to combine reconfigurable logic with a general-purpose CPU. In this scheme, a special computer language compiles fast-running subroutines into a bit-mask to configure the logic. Slower, or less-critical parts of the program can be run by sharing their time on the CPU. This process allows creating devices such as software radios, by using digital signal processing to perform functions usually performed by analog electronics. =Open source processors= As the lines between hardware and software increasingly blur due to progress in design methodology and availability of chips such as field- programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and cheaper production processes, even open source hardware has begun to appear. Loosely knit communities like OpenCores and RISC-V have recently announced fully open CPU architectures such as the OpenRISC which can be readily implemented on FPGAs or in custom produced chips, by anyone, with no license fees, and even established processor makers like Sun Microsystems have released processor designs (e.g., OpenSPARC) under open-source licenses. = Asynchronous CPUs = Yet another option is a clockless or asynchronous CPU. Unlike conventional processors, clockless processors have no central clock to coordinate the progress of data through the pipeline. Instead, stages of the CPU are coordinated using logic devices called pipe line controls or FIFO sequencers. Basically, the pipeline controller clocks the next stage of logic when the existing stage is complete. Thus, a central clock is unneeded. Relative to clocked logic, it may be easier to implement high performance devices in asynchronous logic: * In a clocked CPU, no component can run faster than the clock rate. In a clockless CPU, components can run at different speeds. * In a clocked CPU, the clock can go no faster than the worst-case performance of the slowest stage. In a clockless CPU, when a stage finishes faster than normal, the next stage can immediately take the results rather than waiting for the next clock tick. A stage might finish faster than normal because of the type of data inputs (e.g., multiplication can be very fast if it occurs by 0 or 1), or because it is running at a higher voltage or lower temperature than normal. Asynchronous logic proponents believe these abilities would have these benefits: * lower power dissipation for a given performance * highest possible execution speeds The biggest disadvantage of the clockless CPU is that most CPU design tools assume a clocked CPU (a synchronous circuit), so making a clockless CPU (designing an asynchronous circuit) involves modifying the design tools to handle clockless logic and doing extra testing to ensure the design avoids metastability problems. Even so, several asynchronous CPUs have been built, including * the ORDVAC and the identical ILLIAC I (1951) * the ILLIAC II (1962), then the fastest computer on Earth * The Caltech Asynchronous Microprocessor, the world-first asynchronous microprocessor (1988) * the ARM- implementing AMULET (1993 and 2000) * the asynchronous implementation of MIPS Technologies R3000, named MiniMIPS (1998)MiniMIPS * the SEAforth multi-core processor from Charles H. Moore SEAforth Overview \\"... asynchronous circuit design throughout the chip. There is no central clock with billions of dumb nodes dissipating useless power. ... the processor cores are internally asynchronous themselves.\\" = Optical communication = One promising option is to eliminate the front-side bus. Modern vertical laser diodes enable this change. In theory, an optical computer's components could directly connect through a holographic or phased open-air switching system. This would provide a large increase in effective speed and design flexibility, and a large reduction in cost. Since a computer's connectors are also its most likely failure points, a busless system may be more reliable. Further, as of 2010, modern processors use 64- or 128-bit logic. Optical wavelength superposition could allow data lanes and logic many orders of magnitude higher than electronics, with no added space or copper wires. = Optical processors = Another long-term option is to use light instead of electricity for digital logic. In theory, this could run about 30% faster and use less power, and allow a direct interface with quantum computing devices. The main problems with this approach are that, for the foreseeable future, electronic computing elements are faster, smaller, cheaper, and more reliable. Such elements are already smaller than some wavelengths of light. Thus, even waveguide-based optical logic may be uneconomic relative to electronic logic. As of 2016, most development effort is for electronic circuitry. =Ionic processors= Early experimental work has been done on using ion-based chemical reactions instead of electronic or photonic actions to implement elements of a logic processor. = Belt machine architecture = Relative to conventional register machine or stack machine architecture, yet similar to Intel's Itanium architecture,http://williams.comp.ncat.edu/comp375/RISCprocessors.pdf a temporal register addressing scheme has been proposed by Ivan Godard and company that is intended to greatly reduce the complexity of CPU hardware (specifically the number of internal registers and the resulting huge multiplexer trees). While somewhat harder to read and debug than general- purpose register names, it aids understanding to view the belt as a moving conveyor belt where the oldest values drop off the belt and vanish. It is implemented in the Mill architecture.  Timeline of events  * 1964. IBM release the 32-bit IBM System/360 with memory protection. * 1968.

Born Claiborne Foster Richardson in Shreveport, Louisiana in 1929, he studied at Louisiana State University. His songwriting career began in the early 1950s with material he contributed to revues staged in New York City by Ben Bagley and Julius Monk. In 1964, he composed The Brightest Show on Earth for the World's Fair held in what is now Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Richardson's first and most notable Broadway theatre score was for the 1971 adaptation of Truman Capote's The Grass Harp. Although the production closed a week after opening night, it has developed a cult following among musical theatre aficionados. Other Broadway credits include incidental music for the 1978 revival of The Royal Family with Rosemary Harris and Eva Le Gallienne, the 1980 revival of The Philadelphia Story with Blythe Danner, and the original play The Curse of an Aching Heart with Faye Dunaway in 1982. Several of Richardson's other scores, including Lola (with a book and lyrics by Kenward Elmslie, his collaborator on The Grass Harp), Bodoni County and Congo Square (with books and lyrics by Frank Gagliano), and The Night of the Hunter and Grossinger's (with books and lyrics by Stephen Cole) have been recorded and received off-Broadway and regional theatre productions. Richardson also composed jingles for television and radio commercials as well as scores for industrial shows and sponsored films. Three months before his death in New York City, his final composition, a suite based on The Grass Harp, was performed by Skitch Henderson and the New York Pops Orchestra at Carnegie Hall.

Helen of Troy was \\"the face that launched a thousand ships\\" such as the \\"Nicean barks\\" of the poem. Poe also refers to Helen as Psyche, a beautiful princess who became the lover of Cupid. Psyche represented the soul to ancient Greeks, and Poe is comparing Helen to the very soul of \\"regions which are Holy Land\\" meaning the soul of Greece from which so much of our ideals of beauty, democracy and learning sprang forth. In ancient Greek, the name Helen literally means \\"sunlight; bright as the dawn\\". Her \\"agate lamp\\" may refer to the moment when Psyche discovered the true identity of Cupid by shining a lamp on him at night; it also refers to the enlightened knowledge of the ancient world, which still influences Western culture today.

It is the third building to house the NC State University Libraries, following Brooks Hall and Holladay Hall. The current building, situated on the Hillsborough Street edge of North Campus,Campus Map (North Campus) is the result of four stages of construction, and houses the majority of the volumes in NC State's collection. As of 2013, the NC State University Libraries are the 50th largest library system in the United States, the 37th largest academic library system in the U.S. and the 26th largest public university library system, respectively.ALA: The Nation's Largest Libraries As of 2018, the system's total holdings amount to over 5.3 million volumes, 127,000 electronic journal subscriptions, approximately 1,000 print subscriptions, 635 bibliographic databases, and access to over 1.2 million electronic books.

Location  The library is situated on Hillsborough Street, on the north edge of campus. The main entrance is on the campus side, integrated into University Plaza (the Brickyard). Prior to 1990, the library was also accessible from the Hillsborough Street side through the Erdahl-Cloyd Wing entrance; however, this entrance was closed that year due to financial and security considerations, as well as numerous complaints about heavy pedestrian traffic through this entrance, which opened into a study and reading area. Name D. H. Hill Jr. Library is named after Daniel Harvey Hill Jr., once part-time NC State librarian, and president of NC State in 1908. He was the son of the scholar and notable Confederate Army General Daniel Harvey Hill. The library's name did not include Jr. until May 2019, when it was changed to more accurately reflect that the library is named after D. H. Hill Jr. rather than his father. History of the N.C. State Libraries =D. H. Hill Jr. Library (Main Library)= Early years (1889–1926) In December 1889, the University Board of Trustees authorized $650 for periodicals and books, which were placed in a single room in Holladay Hall. The collection was overseen by the university's first professor of English and future third chancellor, Daniel Harvey Hill Jr. Comprising 1,500 volumes by 1890, it reflected Hill's scholarly and literary interests instead of a purely scientific and engineering focus; indeed, the library was considered to be part of the Department of English. Through the 1890s, the collection primarily consisted of required reading materials for English courses taught by Hill and American and European history courses taught by Professor Alexander Holladay.High, Walter. \\"The D. H. Hill Library, B.C. (Before Computers)\\" D. H. Hill Library Focus. No. 25 (April–May 1977): 6–7. PrintLittleton, I.T. \\"The D. H. Hill Library: An Informal History 1887–1987\\". Friends of the Library. 1993. 4–5. Print The concept of a centralized library system was not considered; by 1893, the departments of agriculture, horticulture, mechanics, physics and mechanical and civil engineering had each developed their own reference collections separately from the primary library. The library moved to three rooms on the third floor of Main Building in the fall of 1897. In 1899, the University of Texas librarian, Benjamin Wyche, came as a consultant and introduced the Dewey Decimal System of classification, a card catalog and library cards; also that year, Edward Bentley Owen, a recent graduate of the college, was hired as librarian. In 1899, the collection totaled some 3,000 volumes, increasing to 3,500 volumes and 125 periodicals by the following year.D. H. Hill Library Focus. No. 7 (September 23, 1966): 6. Print In its first years, the library received little support. The annual library expenditure was $100 in 1892, raised to $400 in 1895. The maintenance budget remained below $1000 until 1925 and records of books borrowed and returned were recorded by hand in a large ledger. Not until 1902 would the first permanent University librarian, Marshall DeLancey Heywood, be hired; however, he resigned the following year after a cut in salary and was succeeded by Caroline Sherman, the first female librarian. A very particular librarian who served until 1906, she would go so far as to fumigate books returned from patrons who had contracted infectious diseases.High, Walter, \\"The D. H. Hill Library, B. C. (Before Computers)\\" D. H. Hill Library Focus. No. 25 (April–May 1977): 6–7. Print In the fall of 1903, the library relocated to the ground floor of the old Pullen Hall (built 1902, destroyed by arson February 1965), where it would remain for the next 22 years. Sherman reported directly to Professor Hill, who remained the permanent chairman of the university library committee and who continued to oversee the selection of books for the library. However, Hill also began subscribing to state newspapers, one for every county, and made them freely available to students for casual reading. He also had books arranged on open shelves to reduce the need for using the card catalog.Littleton, I.T. \\"The D. H. Hill Library: An Informal History 1887–1987\\". Friends of the Library. 1993. 8–9. Print Sherman was succeeded by Elsie Stockard, who served as librarian until June 1910. In 1908, Hill became the third president of State College, and relinquished his position as chair of the library committee. The new committee heads, English professors Thomas P. Harrison and George Sumney, initiated the process of asking department heads to recommend new books for the library. Under the supervision of Charlotte M. Williamson, librarian from 1910 to 1923, library holdings grew to 7,500 print volumes and 150 magazines and journals by 1911.Historical State: History of the N.C. State Libraries However, library growth remained slow; the annual library budget continued to be about $500 during Hill's tenure as college president. By 1916, when Hill retired, the collection only numbered some 8,000 volumes, excluding materials in departmental libraries.Littleton, I.T. \\"The D. H. Hill Library: An Informal History 1887–1987\\". Friends of the Library. 1993. 9. Print In October 1922, with the situation in a dismal state, a resolution was adopted by university alumni resolving that, \\"the Board of Trustees be asked to include in their recommendations to the Legislature of 1923 a request for an appropriation of $250,000 to build and equip a library capable of serving the needs of a greater and better North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Engineering.\\" By 1923, the library's numerous deficiencies were all too clear; one dean later recalled the library \\"consisted of a half-dozen half-filled stacks. Nearly everything was hopelessly out of date.\\"Littleton, I.T. \\"The D. H. Hill Library: An Informal History 1887–1987\\". Friends of the Library. 1993. 10.

Print That fall, all materials in departmental libraries were brought under a central cataloging system as a part of the main library. On December 28, plans were made to construct a new library building (now Brooks Hall), for $227,500. While the library acquired its 10,000th volume in 1924, a fire destroyed the library catalogue the same year. As a result, the library classification system changed to the Library of Congress Classification, which remains in use through the present day. Inter- library loans were introduced in 1925. The new D. H. Hill Library opened with a limited schedule on October 15, 1925, opened with full service hours on January 1, 1926, and was dedicated on June 7, 1926. Built at a final cost of $266,500, including $25,000 for equipment, it was designed by New York architect Hobart Upjohn in a post-colonial style reminiscent of Monticello. The main reading room occupied the whole of the rear of the entrance hall; it and a separate periodicals room provided space for 250 readers, or about 20 percent of the college's total student population. The second floor was occupied by graduate student and faculty seminar and research rooms, while bookstacks with a maximum capacity for 150,000 volumes were housed in the basement.Littleton, I.T. \\"The D. H. Hill Library: An Informal History 1887–1987\\". Friends of the Library. 1993. 13. Print By this time, the main library collection totaled 15,000 volumes, which subsequently rose to about 18,000 following the integration of the various departmental libraries with the main collection. However, only 7,301 of the volumes in the collection were allowed to circulate, with the remaining 11,569 reserved for library use. Gradual growth (1926–1959) Despite the opening of the new library, the N.C. State College library system remained inadequate. In early 1926, an American Library Association report ranked the State library last among 50 land-grant institutions in terms of volumes held. Of the three major colleges and universities in the area, State's collection of about 15,000 volumes ranked well below that of the University of North Carolina's 150,000 volumes and Duke's 85,000 volumes. The average circulation of less than four books per student remained well below the average of 13 books per student reported by comparative institutions, while the library budget was only 10 percent of the lowest recommended percentage of an institution's annual library allocation. On March 8, the college Library Committee requested \\"each school faculty and the general College faculty [to] consider these matters seriously, with a view of bringing this College up to a standard of at least a general average.\\" In 1926, the library staff consisted of James Gulledge as head librarian, with Charlotte Williams as reference librarian, assistant librarian Agnes Cooper (loans, circulation and periodicals), assistant librarian Jeannette Burroughs (cataloguing), and seven part-time student library assistants. Gulledge left in the spring of 1926 to take up a position at Louisiana State University, and the position of librarian was eliminated. Instead, to save money, the college placed the library under the aegis of the Library Committee, with the intention of using the savings to purchase books. Frank Capps, the committee's executive secretary, was designated library supervisor, though he lacked the required qualifications. While the annual library expenditure had increased to about $3,000 by the early 1930s, library services remained poor.Littleton, I.T. \\"The D. H. Hill Library: An Informal History 1887–1987\\". Friends of the Library. 1993. 16. Print In 1931, the collection totaled 30,000 volumes. In 1933, the University collaborated with UNC and Duke University to form the North Carolina Union Catalog, the first shared catalog among the three universities. Capps resigned in July, and was briefly succeeded by the History chair Hugh Talmadge Lefler (1901–1981) as acting Library Director before being replaced with William Porter Kellam (1905–1993) on July 1 the following year. The first professional Director in several years, and the first modern one, Kellam found the library in a chaotic state upon taking up his appointment; government publications and periodicals lay uncatalogued in the basement, faculty members were allowed to keep books indefinitely and academic departments had continued to purchase books and periodicals, but had generally neither cataloged them properly nor made them available to others. The student assistants who operated the library during nights and weekends were poorly trained, poorly supervised and often disorganized.Littleton, I.T. \\"The D. H. Hill Library: An Informal History 1887–1987\\". Friends of the Library. 1993. 14–15. Print To rectify the situation, Kellam centralized the acquisition of periodicals, increased the number of professional librarians on staff, nearly doubled the number of volumes in the collection and organized the library into five departments: circulation, reference (documents), order (books and periodicals), cataloging and periodicals (check-in, binding, exchanges). Each department was headed by a professional librarian. As a result, hours of service increased during evenings and weekends, faculty members were allowed to only keep borrowed materials for a year before having to renew them and a training program was instituted for student assistants.Littleton, I.T. \\"The D. H. Hill Library: An Informal History 1887–1987\\". Friends of the Library. 1993. 17. Print A browsing room opened in 1936 and the collection grew to 50,000 volumes in 1937.The D. H.

Print The University Archives were begun in the University's 50th anniversary year in 1939, and expenditures increased to $10,000 the same year; the number of current periodicals received by the library nearly doubled from 400 to 700. However, by the time Kellam left on August 31, 1939, the D. H. Hill Library building was found to be cramped and functionally obsolete. The library was no longer in the center of the campus, as the campus had expanded west over the previous decade. As Kellam concluded, \\"...the present library building was planned from an artistic point of view and not for efficiency and without benefit of a librarian's advice. The same mistake should not be repeated.\\"Littleton, I.T. \\"The D. H. Hill Library: An Informal History 1887–1987\\". Friends of the Library. 1993. 20.

Appointed as the circulation librarian in 1936, he had helped to transform that area of library operations; during his 25 years as Director, he would oversee the transformation of D. H. Hill into a major university library.Littleton, I.T., \\"Harlan Craig Brown (1906–1982),\\" The D. H. Hill Library Focus. Vol. 3, No. 3 & 4 (Fall/Winter 1982–1983): 8.

Print During his absence, reference librarian Reba Davis Clevenger served as acting Director, with a staff of six professional librarians and four others. In 1945, Clevenger and the Library Committee presented a report which highlighted three urgent needs: a new, centralized library building, a greatly increased book and periodicals budget and more and better-paid staff. Brown resumed the library directorship on September 1, 1946. The Friends of the Library organization was formed on September 21, 1946, and library holdings reached 75,000 volumes by 1947 and 100,000 volumes in February 1949. During the immediate postwar years, the library struggled; the now-obsolete building only provided seating for four percent of the total student and faculty population. Library expenditures, while by now $75,000, remained inadequate to support a well-functioning library. Finally, the 1948–1949 N.C. General Assembly approved $1.25 million to construct and outfit a new library building. Planning began in 1949, and the contract was awarded to Northup and O'Brien Architects of Winston-Salem on August 6, 1951.Littleton, I.T. \\"The D. H. Hill Library: An Informal History 1887–1987\\".

It provided 900 seats for patrons, space for 400,000 volumes and the possibility of adding another two stories should the need arise.

A 150-seat theatre on the second floor was renovated in 1974, and the Reserve Reading Room occupied the renovated building in May 1975.Littleton, I.T. \\"The D. H. Hill Library: An Informal History 1887–1987\\". Friends of the Library. 1993. 67. Print Computerised cataloguing of materials began in 1975, and the card catalogue began to be retroactively converted in 1976. Also in 1976, collections totaled over 700,000 volumes,D. H. Hill Library Focus. No. 22 (Fall 1975): 2. Print and a Rare Book and Special Collections Room was established adjacent to the University Archives and was administered by the Reference Department. In 1977, the library directors of N.C. State, UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke University began planning a cooperative program for the three major Triangle universities. In 1978, the 800,000th volume was added to the collection.The D. H. Hill Library Focus. No. 31 (May–June 1978): 1. Print By the end of the 1970s, the new bookstack addition was becoming crowded, barely a decade after it had been constructed. In January 1976, the university began planning another library addition.Littleton, I.T. \\"The D. H. Hill Library: An Informal History 1887–1987\\". Friends of the Library. 1993. 88. Print In December 1981, the library submitted two alternate plans for the expansion, one for a building with space for 3,000 seats and 2 million volumes at a cost of $25 million, and a revised alternate plan for an addition of about half the size presented in the first plan. Both were rejected by the 1981–1982 state legislature. Other suggestions from campus planners and independent experts included building the new addition to the west of the previous one, or adding two floors to the East Wing and storing lesser-used books in a remote storage building.Littleton, I.T. \\"The D. H. Hill Library: An Informal History 1887–1987\\". Friends of the Library. 1993. 88–92. Print From January to April 1982, an ad hoc planning committee reviewed the planning documents; the committee submitted a tentative report in mid-April in which it recommended an addition with a minimum capacity of 750,000 volumes and 1,000 to 3,000 seats. On April 1, the firm of Six Associates, Inc. of Asheville was selected as the project architect. Detailed planning began in late May, at which time all previous concepts for the addition were dismissed. On May 29, the architects proposed a plan for an innovative expansion from both the south and east sides of the building; the proposal would incorporate room for over 2 million volumes and nearly 3,000 seats. However, the proposal was ultimately considered too costly and ambitious. A modified plan, in which only the south addition would be built, was approved in 1984 and thoroughly worked out by August 1985; under the plan, the 80,000 square-foot addition would contain bookstacks for an additional 550,000 volumes, a main ground-floor entrance from the Brickyard, a reading room to the right of the entrance, a wide staircase sweeping up to the first floor of the original tower and the circulation desk and a balcony overlooking the reading room. Library holdings reached 1 million volumes in 1981. On May 4, 1983, N.C. State became a member of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL). Site preparation for the new library addition, which involved demolishing the large exterior concrete staircase leading to the library tower, began in August 1985 and ended in February 1986. Navarro Construction of Pittsburgh, PA, was selected as the general contractor in the summer of 1986, and they began construction that October. However, they abandoned the project due to financial troubles, necessitating the employment of new contractors, which delayed completion of the addition by two years. In 1986, the library system's online catalog, the Bibliographic Information System (BIS), became active. In addition to providing information on library holdings, BIS gave users access to information on holdings at the other TRLN libraries. The card catalogue fell out of use in 1987, and \\"The NCSU Libraries\\" became the official name of the library system. In August, Susan Nutter (1944–2019) became the first female director of the NCSU Libraries, succeeding I.T. Littleton; she became president of the ARL six years later. In 1989, the 100th anniversary year of the founding of NCSU Libraries, the system assumed administrative control over the University Archives. On October 1, 1990, the current library was completed with the addition of the 11-story (numbered B,G, 1–9) Bookstack South Tower, adding space for another 500,000 volumes. The Information Technologies Teaching Center (ITTC) was established that same year, initially funded by a gift from the senior class of 1990. In December 1991, the Library began a trial of an electronic document delivery service for university researchers. A new and more accessible information system which could be accessed through the Internet was introduced in 1993; along with the online catalogue, it included access to external databases and journal indexes. In 1994, the year the Libraries' holdings reached 2 million volumes, NCSU Libraries was selected by the ARL as one of six \\"Research Libraries of the Future.\\" Daily van delivery between the branch libraries and D. H. Hill began the same year. In 1995, the Special Collections Research Center was established, and self-service circulation began at D. H. Hill. In 1996, the Library began the current 24-hour, five-days-a week service, formed the Digital Library Initiatives Department and with aid from a tuition increase, NCSU Libraries initiated the TRIPSaver service for patrons to expedite retrieval of items from other TRLN libraries. In 1997, the NCSU Libraries become a charter member of the JSTOR electronic archive of journal articles. In 2000, the NCSU Libraries won the first \\"Excellence in Academic Libraries Award,\\" sponsored by the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL), in the university library category. The 21st century (2001–present) In 2001, library holdings reached three million volumes. The \\"Hill of Beans\\" cafe' opened the following year. After years of seating and storage shortages, a Satellite Shelving Facility was opened in 2003 to store low-use materials.\\"Running Out of Space: NCSU Libraries opens On-Campus Shelving Facility,\\" Focus Online. Vol. 24:1 (2003) In 2005, the Librarian, Susan Nutter, was named \\"Librarian of the Year\\" by the Library Journal. In 2006, the Libraries introduced a revolutionary new online catalogue based on the Endeca platform, which provided users with advanced search and navigation capabilities. The library's East Wing underwent a large- scale renovation targeted at creating a study/work/recreation/socializing area with technology integration. The newly renovated wing was reopened on March 12, 2007 after a large ribbon-cutting ceremony. The outdoor terrace featured at D. H. Hill Jr. Library The 4 millionth volume was added to the library collection in 2009. On April 20, 2009, University Dining, partnered with the department of food science and D. H. Hill Library, opened the Creamery ice cream shop in the West Wing. During the summer of 2011, further renovations to the West Wing transformed an area formerly housing print periodicals into over 13,600 feet of study space, also allowing trials with the new furnishings and technology to be installed in the Hunt Library. A lounge area by the Creamery became the Technology Sandbox, with whiteboards, gaming stations, writable glass walls and interactive tables. A large portion of an area where print periodicals were previously located became a glass-enclosed silent reading room with 70 seats for individual study, marble-topped tables and power outlets; the area overlooks an outdoor terrace. The terrace had been built in 1954 when the West Wing was the Erdahl-Cloyd Student Union. Frequently used for dances; it fell into disuse after the student union moved to the Talley Student Center in 1972, remaining vacant for decades. In the summer of 2011, the terrace was repaired and modernized; the original exterior glass wall separating the new reading room from the terrace was replaced with energy- efficient glass, allowing views of the Brickyard from the reading room. Umbrella-topped tables and colourful lounge chairs providing seating for 70 were installed, along with power outlets and a new railing.NCSU Libraries News, 16 August 2011 In 2014, the number of volumes in the Libraries' collections passed 5 million. Though the construction of Hunt Library nearly tripled the Libraries' seating capacity from 5 to 13 percent, concerns remained that seating capacity remained below the ideal of 20 percent of users. Director of Libraries and Vice Provost Susan Nutter retired on September 30, 2017, after 30 years as libraries director. From May 2019 until August 2020, the D.H. Hill Jr. Library has undergone large-scale renovations which involve redesigning the main entrance to allow stairs to reach the third floor and allow views of the fourth floor, along with the construction of an Academic Success Center on the third floor. The former Hillsborough Street entrance, closed since 1990, has been redesigned and has been permanently reopened as of May 2019. =Design Library= In 1941, the Architecture Library (renamed the Harry B. Lyons Design Library in 1968) opened in Daniels Hall. It relocated to Brooks Hall in 1954 after D. H. Hill Library moved to its current location, and has remained there since, becoming a branch library in 1971. =Burlington Textiles Library (1944–2013)= On April 27, 1944, Malcolm Campbell, the Dean of the School of Textiles, presented a request for a Textile School Library to the North Carolina State College Library Committee. The Textiles Library opened on October 23, 1944, temporarily as part of the main library. The first librarian, Rachel Penn Lane, organized the textiles collection of 1000 volumes and periodicals in preparation for the transfer to Nelson Hall, which was made on June 6, 1945. The library would remain there for the next 45 years. By May 1954, the collection had increased to 4,500 volumes, 120 periodicals, and 37 international journals. It was renamed the Burlington Textiles Library that year, when Burlington Industries funded its expansion. In 1964, a further donation by Burlington funded an expansion which doubled the library's floor space and increased seating capacity to 70.D. H. Hill Library Focus. No. 2 (February 2, 1965): 11. Print Along with the Design and the Natural Resources collections, it was reclassified as a branch library in 1971. A further expansion in 1982 increased the library's dimensions to 6000 square feet, providing room for more study space, computers and shelving. Collections increased to 20,000 volumes by 1983 and to over 25,000 volumes by 1991.Garwig, Paul. \\"Burlington Textiles Library,\\" The NCSU Libraries Focus. Vol. 14. No. 7 (1994): 3–5. Print In 1991, the College of Textiles and its library moved to a new building on Centennial Campus. The new 12,855 square-foot facility offered seating for 154 students; by then, library resources also included collections of fabrics and hosiery. As of 2010, the library held over 40,000 volumes and more than 90 periodicals. In July 2007, the North Carolina General Assembly allocated planning funds for the new James B. Hunt Jr. Library to be built on Centennial Campus. The official groundbreaking took place on October 26, 2009, and the collections of the Burlington Textiles Library and certain main library materials were moved into the new library in mid-December 2012. On January 2, 2013, Hunt Library opened and the Burlington Textiles Library ceased to exist.Hunt Library Librarians of the Textiles and the Burlington Textiles Library were: Rachel Penn Lane (1945–1946), Jane Byrd (1946–1947), Katherine McDiarmid (1947–1957), Martha Lynch (1957–1959; acting), Adrianna Orr (1959–1965), Geraldine Stallings (1965–1967), Davora Nielsen (1967–1969), James Baker (1969–1976), Georgia Rodeffer (1976–1984), Catherine Pollari (1985, acting), Barbara Best Nichols (1985–1990), Cynthia Ruffin (1990, interim), Paul Garwig (1990–1998), Suzanne Weiner (1998–2001) and Honora Eskridge (2001–2013).Garwig, Paul. \\"50th Anniversary of the Textiles Library,\\" The NCSU Libraries Focus.

In 1989, the library was renamed the Natural Resources Library and moved to its present location in Jordan Hall. The School of Forest Resources became the College of Natural Resources in 2000. =William Rand Kenan Jr. Library of Veterinary Medicine= The library opened in the fall of 1981 as the Veterinary Medicine Library. It was officially rededicated on November 16, 2006 as the William Rand Kenan, Jr. Library of Veterinary Medicine after William Rand Kenan Jr. (1872–1965), a prominent dairy farmer, philanthropist and breeder of Jersey cattle.Vet.

Overview of D. H. Hill Jr. Library  D. H. Hill was built in four major stages, from 1953 to 1990: # \\"East Wing\\" completed in 1953 and renovated in 2007. # \\"Erdahl-Cloyd Student Union\\", completed 1954, became Erdahl-Cloyd (West) Wing in 1972 and The Atrium. # \\"Bookstack North\\", completed in 1972, a 10-story shelving area. # \\"Bookstack South\\", completed in 1990, an 11-story shelving area fronting the Brickyard.  Tenants  = NC State University Libraries = The NC State University Libraries primarily occupies the D. H. Hill Jr. Library building; however, the building also houses other tenants, including The Creamery and Hill of Beans – both operated by University Dining. D. H. Hill Jr. Library also houses the Libraries' Special Collections Research Center. The NC State University Libraries is composed of five libraries: D. H. Hill Jr. Library, the Harrye B. Lyons Design Library, the Natural Resources Library, the William Rand Kenan, Jr. Library of Veterinary Medicine, and the newly constructed James B. Hunt, Jr. Library on Centennial Campus. = The Atrium = The Atrium is a group of quick-service restaurants, accepting on- campus meal plans, \\"dining dollars\\", Visa, MasterCard and cash. It is open Monday through Thursday from 7:30 am to 10:00 pm, and Friday from 7:30 am to 3:00 pm, but is not open on weekends. The general public is welcome to the Atrium, which is located on the bottom level of the Erdahl-Cloyd Wing. Not accessible through the Erdahl-Cloyd Wing, only through the \\"Brickyard\\". The restaurants at the Atrium include: * Chick-Fil-A – This CFA serves a limited menu, but won an award for most sales on any college campus in 2005. Chick- Fil-A opened in the Atrium on August 24, 1994. * Delirious – salads and wraps. * Brickyard Pizza and Pasta – Italian dishes. * Zen Blossom – Asian dishes. * Wolfpack-to-Go – pre-made sandwiches, pitas, and snack items. There is limited seating inside and outside the Atrium itself. This seating tends to be very full at peak lunch hours. The library proper and the Atrium are not internally connected. The Atrium underwent a comprehensive renovation, which was completed in August 2011. = Hill of Beans = The Hill of Beans coffee shop is inside the library itself, near the main entrance to the D. H. Hill library. Opened in 2002, it serves specialty coffee beverages, as well as snack and pastry items. = Creamery = The Creamery is an ice cream shop located on the first floor of the west wing of the library. There is also a service window for take-out orders on the Hillsborough Street side of the building. The shop serves hand-scooped ice cream, milkshakes and sundaes featuring Howling Cow dairy products, which are made from milk produced at NC State's research farms and processed on the NC State campus creamery. The Creamery opened on April 20, 2009. Howling Cow ice cream is now available in local Harris Teeter grocery stores as well as on campus.  Inside D. H. Hill  = Hours = Prior to 1925, the library was open from 8 a.m. to 12:45 p.m., 1:15 to 6 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to a 10 p.m. closing time Mondays through Fridays. On weekends, it was open from 8 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. and from 1:15 p.m. until closing at 6 p.m; it was open on Sundays from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. The first D. H. Hill Library began operations on a limited basis from November 1925, with hours from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., 1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Mondays through Fridays. Effective from January 1926, full-service library hours were from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Mondays through Fridays. On March 12 1955, when the new D. H. Hill Library was dedicated, its hours were extended through 11 p.m. On December 8, 1967, closing hours were extended to midnight. In 1996, a system of 24-hour service (Sunday night through Thursday night) was instituted. Under this system, D. H. Hill was open 24 hours a day from Monday through Thursday. On Fridays and Saturdays, the Library closed at 10 p.m. On Saturdays and Sundays, the Library opened at 9 a.m. 24-hour service resumed Sunday night. Owing to budget reductions in 2014, a modified system was developed, effective from the fall of 2014. Under this system, the Library was open from 9 a.m. to midnight on Sundays and from 7 a.m. to midnight on Mondays. On Tuesdays, the Library opened at 7 a.m. with 24-hour service through Friday night, when it closed at 10 p.m. On Saturdays, the Library opened at 9 a.m. and closed at 10 p.m. D.H. Hill Library returned to regular 24-hour service in the fall of 2015. During the summers, the Library is open from 7am to 11 pm Sundays through Thursdays, and from 7am to 6pm on Fridays and weekends. = Study areas = D. H. Hill provides computers and study space for approximately 5% of the 34,000 member student body. Guidelines for the University of North Carolina system call for seating of up to 20% of the student body. As a result, the James B. Hunt, Jr. library was constructed on Centennial Campus. Despite this perceived service gap, D. H. Hill strives to accommodate the needs of students with loaner laptops, group study and individual study areas on several floors. = Collections = D. H. Hill Jr. Library houses the majority of the volumes in NCSU's collection, and is a designated federal and state document repository. Engineering and textiles collections are housed in Hunt Library on Centennial Campus. Three branch libraries house architecture/design, earth science and animal/veterinary science materials, respectively. Materials relating to education, mathematics and African studies are primarily held in three small departmental media centers, which are affiliated with the Libraries. A Satellite Shelving Facility mostly houses older journals and periodical publications for the NCSU Libraries Special Collections Research Center. D. H. Hill and the NC State University Library system's strengths are in keeping with the strengths of the University itself, namely engineering, science, agriculture, veterinary medicine, and mathematics. However, the Libraries also have strengths in architecture, design, humanities, and social sciences.  Statistics  The NC State University Libraries is a member of several professional organizations, including the Association of Research Libraries, the Center for Research Libraries, and the Digital Library Federation. It was the first academic library organization to receive the Association of College and Research Libraries' Excellence in Academic Libraries Award, and was the recipient in 2003 of the American Library Association's Library of the Future award. Currently the NC State University Libraries employs 288 people, of which 124 are librarians or other professionals. D. H. Hill alone circulates one million volumes per year.

H. Hill Library"},{"id":"9506973","text":"Grapus was a collective of graphic artists, working together between 1970 and 1991, which sought to combine excellence of design with a social conscience. The work of Grapus design collective belonged to the public square, it represented a dialog between governments and citizens; culture and politics, and in the final analysis the message and the form. Its visual communication in the public square was bold and honest it was aware of its presence and its impact; and at same time it was informed by the socio-cultural parameters of time in all its dimensions past, present and expected future which provided a contest for experimentation and innovation. Throughout their history, Grapus remained Communists and idealists and continued to be operated collectively: all work left the studio signed ‘Grapus’ even when their studio numbers had grown to around 20, operating in three separate collectives. History History and Members Grapus is a collective of French designers and they were founded after the student movements of Paris in May 1968. Grapus sought to 'change life' by the twine dynamics of graphic arts and political action. The collective scorned the commercial advertising, and adhering to its founders idealistic principles, tried to bring culture to politics, and politics to culture. The meaning behind Grapus's name was described by Bernard that it was functional-sounding, had vulgar overtones, and also had a \\"whiff of history to it,\\" referring to French revolutionary Gracchus Babuef. Another interpretation for the creation of the name Grapus, is it was a play on the words crapules staliniennes (Stalinist scum), was both a gesture of political allegiance and a sardonic provocation to potential critics. The group was founded in France in 1970 by Pierre Bernard, who had studied with the Polish poster designer Henryk Tomaszewski; François Miehe; and Gérard Paris-Clavel, who had met during the student movement of May 1968 and were influenced by the subversive ideas and practices of the Situationist International. Alex Jordan and Jean- Paul Bachollet joined the group in 1975. After Miehe’s departure in 1978, the core of the group found its equilibrium. The group's members were all members of the Communist party, and the group maintained an explicit political, social and cultural engagement. They at first rejected assignments with commercial and government clients, instead working with experimental theatre groups, progressive town councils, the Communist Party itself, the Communist trade union CGT, educational causes, and social institutions. Even in later years, when the staff had grown to 20, operating in three distinct groups, they signed all of their work simply \\"Grapus.\\"Liz McQuiston, Graphic Agitation: Social and Political Graphics since the Sixties, Phaidon, p. 56 Grapus wore its Marxist heritage proudly, remaining devoted to the plebeian immediacy of posters, leaflets and bumper stickers. Among its recurring elements of style are the use of handwritten text, the use of an extensive symbolic vocabulary (e.g. hand, foot, moon, sun), and the convergence of diverse techniques (e.g. drawing, painting, photography, text), a technique known as \\"detournement, the rerouting of a message through acts of visual vandalism.\\" Beginning in 1978, Grapus gained exposure in important exhibitions in Paris (Musée de l'Affiche); Amsterdam (Stedelijk Museum); Aspen, Colorado; and Montréal (Musée d'art contemporain). In 1990, after receiving the French Grand prix national des arts graphiques, the collective faced a difficult ideological test when they had the opportunity to design the visual identity of the Louvre Museum. Bernard was in favor of taking the assignment, believing that design for cultural institutions could be a tool for social change. His partners wanted to design exclusively for social causes, found the Louvre to be elitist, and believed that taking the job would compromise their convictions. As a result, the collective decided to part ways in January 1991. Bernard, however, remains committed to a conception of design as a powerful tool for social commitment: \\"The dissemination of public graphic design to the most socially and/or culturally deprived, is one of the means to achieve the desired aims of community and social justice.\\"  Goals  \\"We are going to make images for you which will have real meaning. We are going to make true political images.\\" Graphic activists, came from their understanding of meaning and how to manipulate it. \\"We discovered semiology and it was very important to us,\\" says Bernard. \\"It allowed us to deconstruct images, so we could say to political commissioning bodies. This was something that was absolutely essential to Grapus. The idea was to form a production group, an artistic collective, to create high-quality images for the political struggle of the French Communist Party. It was both a political and a graphic commitment.  Method & Style  Grapus had a highly distinctive style. They provided inspiration to graphic design students all over the world through their idealistic principles. They often used bright colors, sensual forms, handwritten text, high-spirited visual pranks, and also very extensive symbolic vocabulary. The technique they used was known as detournement, which is the rerouting of a message through acts of visual vandalism. They were considered in France as the M/M's punk/grunge aesthetic. This aesthetic challenged the older graphic design establishment. (Darby) In the early 2000, when bands like Air and Daft Punk emerged, \\"the French music scene was completely dead.\\" As a result, marketing music in France was enjoying a huge injection of finance. Since then, the so- called \\"French Touch\\" has helped young French graphic designers to emerge. Through their work as graphic designers and creative directors in the fields of art, fashion and music, Amzalag and Augustyniak have established M/M as a powerful force in contemporary French culture.  Work  Their work focused heavily on posters One important thing about these posters was that the subjects were new, at least for the French. They were theatrical posters, cinema posters dealing with poetry, sports. These subjects were not being addressed in France because, for the most part, poster-makers were working in advertising, more often than not for products. Grapus's clients also speak to the groups controversial work. Clients didn’t tend to stay with Grapus very long. That’s one of the reasons why Grapus had financial problems, Grapus attitude towards day-to-day life excited clients, but at the same time it makes clients take risks. Clients don’t like to take one risk after another. \\"Even in the successful campaigns, our clients often had a feeling that they had been abused by us. They felt that we rather forced their hands, that we’d expressed ourselves in their place. At some point they agree to the means of expression we use – they claim it as their own since we do the work in their name. Nevertheless they felt a bit frustrated. Perhaps that’s because we didn’t behave like suppliers, slavishly following their instructions. Rather, we were like equal partners, working towards a common goal, which they had decided to share with us by offering us the job. They may have felt slightly dispossessed. We are very aware of it with the passage of time, when we’ve spoken to them again later, or when other people have spoken to them.\\" – Pierre Bernard The posters were a vital part of the struggle shared by students and workers, expressing its key ideas in the most direct public language available, inscribing the streets of Paris with these urgent messages, and attaining a level of visibility and impact on the consciousness of spectators, in some locations, normally achieved only by commercial advertising Legacy Grapus's split up was linked to a desire to continue the form of action which Grapus represented. In order to continue the Grapus mode of production, to begin a new form of adventure with new people. Their mode of production is one of conflict. \\"We are in conflict with the clients, but there is also conflict between us. Everyone can talk about and work on everyone else’s project.\\" That principle of creative conflict has been very difficult to maintain in the 1980s. When the old-timers start arguing between themselves, the younger people just leave. It’s like a conflict between the bosses rather than a conflict between creative peers. For the younger members of Grapus to play their part completely, we need complete equality. Thus forming three new Grapus groups. The group's original members have maintained their principles in their work. Pierre Bernard, along with Dirk Behage and Fokke Draaijer, founded the Atelier de Création Graphique (ACG). They took the Louvre job and, among other works, designed the identity for the national parks of France, and signage for the Centre Pompidou. The ACG works in the areas of publishing, publicity and signage, as well as creating visual identity. Pierre Bernard has been a member of the Alliance Graphique Internationale since 1987, received the Erasmus Prize in 2006, and teaches graphic design in Paris at the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs (ENSAD). Gérard Paris-Clavel joined with Vincent Perrottet to begin the studio les Graphistes Associés. Shortly thereafter, he left and formed the group Ne Pas Plier (\\"do not bend\\"), which broke with the traditional conception of a graphic studio by refusing \\"corporate\\" work, allying itself instead with sociologists, social workers, laborers, and other workers for public education. Alex Jordan founded the studio Nous Travaillons Ensemble (NTE: \\"we work together\\") with Ronit Meirovitz and Anette Lenz, with whom he had worked within Grapus. They intended to pursue a seamless continuation of the Grapus approach, without being constricted by a paralyzing ideology. Since its creation in 1986, NTE has worked in partnership with the photographers’ association le bar Floréal, and has also collaborated on numerous works with the multidisciplinary organization la Forge.

He played collegiate lacrosse at Hofstra University. Iannucci plays professional lacrosse for the Colorado Mammoth of the National Lacrosse League. He was a member of the now defunct St. Regis Indians of the Ontario Lacrosse Association's Senior-A Major Series Lacrosse. He plays in the summer months for the WLA Langley Thunder. He currently resides in Langley BC with his wife and 4 children. Ryker Iannucci born January 31st 2015, Nixon Iannucci born March 18th 2016, Hawksen Iannucci born December 19th 2017, and Presley Iannucci born April 17th 2019. Professional career =NLL career= Iannucci was a First Round Draft pick (8th Overall) by the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League in the 2007 NLL Entry Draft. He was awarded Rookie of the Week Honors in Week 5 and Week 15 of the 2007 season, and was also named to the 2007 All-Rookie team. As a rookie, he led the Wings in goals scored. Iannucci's second season in the league was record-setting. On April 12, 2008, Iannucci scored three goals and broke Gary Gait's National Lacrosse League record of 61 goals in a season. During 2008, Iannucci was awarded Player of the Month honours in both January and February, the first time since 1996 that a player has been Player of the Month in back- to-back months. He was also named player of the month for April, giving him three of the four player of the month awards in the 2008 season. He led the league in goals, points, and shots on goal, was named Offensive and Overall Player of the Week in week 16, was named to both the starting All-Star team and the First All-Pro team. His stellar season was capped off when he was named 2008 NLL Most Valuable Player, the first Wings player to do so since Gary Gait in 1997. In June 2008, Iannucci suffered two meniscal tears in his knee, and underwent successful knee surgery in July. He did not play again until Philadelphia's third game of the 2009 season, but left that game after only playing a few minutes. Iannucci sat out the 2010 NLL season to undergo further surgery, a right leg ligament reconstruction. After scoring 100 (71g 29a) points with the Wings in 2011, Philadelphia traded Iannucci to the Edmonton Rush with teammates Alex Turner and Brodie McDonald, along with Philadelphia's first round draft picks in 2012, 2013 and 2014. In exchange, the Wings acquired Edmonton transition player Brodie Merrill, Rush forwards Dean Hill, Mike McLellan, and Edmonton's 41st selection in the 2011 entry draft, and the 4th round selection in 2013. Iannucci never signed a contract with the Rush, and on February 13, 2012, he was traded to the Washington Stealth for Paul Rabil. After two seasons in Washington, Iannucci was released by the Stealth prior to the 2014 season but only two weeks into the season, he was signed by the Colorado Mammoth. =MLL= The Chicago Machine selected Iannucci first Overall in the 2007 Major League Lacrosse Supplemental Draft, though he played sparingly with the team in 2007. He signed with the Toronto Nationals expansion team in 2009, but played just two games with the team before being released. WLA/OLA career In 2007, Iannucci won the Denny Huddleston Memorial Trophy in the Western Lacrosse Association as the league's top scorer with the New Westminster Salmonbellies. In 1999, he won the Joe Nieuwendyk Award as the top rookie in the OLA Junior A Lacrosse League. In 2008, he played for St. Regis Indians of the Ontario Lacrosse Association's Senior-A Major Series Lacrosse until he injured his knee. The knee was successfully repaired by surgery and Iannucci is expected to rehabilitate for approximately 6 months, in time for the next NLL season. While playing for the Langley Thunder on August 27, 2011, the team won the Western Lacrosse Association Championship for the first time in franchise history. Iannucci is expected to play in the national Mann Cup that will be held in September 2011 at the Langley Events Centre. College career Iannucci attended Hofstra University. In 2006, he tied with teammate Chris Unterstein for leading scorer the nation with 80 points (62G, 18A) in 19 games. While at Hofstra, Iannucci had back surgery to repair a disc herniation. Iannucci played only three years at Hofstra, after his NCAA eligibility waiver for a fourth year was denied due to his prior playing career in the Canadian summer box lacrosse leagues.

To observe flash suppression, a small image is first presented to one eye for about a second while a blank field is presented to the other eye. Then a different, small image is abruptly shown, flashed, to the other, second eye at the location corresponding to the image to the first eye. The image to the first eye disappears, even though it is still presented, and only the new image is perceived. The new image to the second eye suppresses perception of the image to the first. For example, if a vehicle is shown to the left eye for 1 second, and then a face is abruptly flashed to the right eye, the observer consciously sees first a vehicle and then a face. Note that the face is seen while the picture of the car is still present. If the order of presentation is reversed, the order of percept is reversed. The phenomenon of flash suppression seemed to have been known since the 19th century. The phenomena was described by McDougall in 1901 (p598) and utilized for an EEG experiment by Lansing in 1964. In 1984, Jeremy Wolfe characterized flash suppression in a systematic psychophysics study. Flash suppression is an example of illusions that render a highly visible image invisible and that are used to study the mechanisms of conscious and non-conscious visual processing (Koch, 2004). Related perceptual illusions include backward masking, binocular rivalry, motion induced blindness and motion-induced interocular suppression. The brain basis of flash suppression has been studied using microelectrode recordings in the visual brain of the macaque monkey (Logothetis, 1998) and in the human medial temporal lobe (Kreiman, Koch & Fried, 2002). Relationship with binocular rivalry  Flash suppression occurs due to the conflict between the inputs to the two eyes. When this conflict is sustained without any abrupt events, binocular rivalry occurs. In both flash suppression and binocular rivalry, perceptual conflict between the two eyes is required for the perceptual effect. If two similar images are used, fusion of the two images is experienced, rather than flash suppression or binocular rivalry. Despite some similarities in perceptual consequences, the neuronal mechanisms responsible for the two illusions can be different. For example, the strength (depth) of flash suppression seems much stronger than that of binocular rivalry. Comparative studies of the two methods are needed. Flash suppression has certain methodological advantages over binocular rivalry as a tool for probing conscious vision. Whereas the percept during binocular rivalry alternates stochastically, the percept during flash suppression is precisely controlled in time. Although flash suppression allows one to present an image to someone without his or her seeing it consciously, it requires a to-be-erased image to be presented for a fraction of second before introduction of a new image. This requirement limits the usage of flash suppression for the study of nonconscious visual processing. Continuous flash suppression A powerful variant of flash suppression is continuous flash suppression, originally reported by Nao Tsuchiya and Christof Koch (2004)Tsuchiya, N., & Koch, C. (2005). Continuous flash suppression reduces negative afterimages. Nature neuroscience, 8(8), 1096-1101. and Fang and He (2005)Fang F, He S. Cortical responses to invisible objects in the human dorsal and ventral pathways. Nat Neurosci. 2005;8:1380–1385). Here a small, fixed image in the first eye—say a gray-scale fearful face—is completely suppressed by a stream of constantly changing images flashed into the second eye (say a series of colorful Mondrian-scenes replaced every 0.1 sec by a new Mondrian pattern). This suppression can last for minutes, a remarkable testament to the fact that humans often do not see what is directly in front of their eyes. Continuous flash suppression is a useful method for psychologists and neuroscientists interested in studying the mechanisms of conscious and nonconscious visual processing. Whereas other visual illusions that render otherwise salient images invisible have their own shortcomings and advantages (Kim & Blake 2005), continuous flash suppression has a number of advantages for wiping images from conscious vision. It can erase an image presented at the fovea (which usually is much more resistant to perceptual suppression, unlike, for example, crowding), in every trial (unlike binocular rivalry), for a longer duration (>1 sec, unlike backward masking), with an excellent control of timing (unlike binocular rivalry). It has been widely exploited to tackle the scope and limits of unconscious processing (Sklar et al., 2012). Generalized flash suppression The differences between flash suppression and binocular rivalry have been further emphasized by the finding that stimulus conflict between the two eyes is not a requirement to achieve visual suppression. The novel paradigm of generalized flash suppression (GFS) reported by Wilke, Logothetis and Leopold (2003) demonstrates that any visual stimulus can be rendered invisible when presented outside the fovea for a certain amount of time, followed by the addition of a distracting second stimulus in its vicinity. This effect is strongest when the two stimuli are presented to (different regions in) opposite eyes, which suggests that it is somewhat related to binocular rivalry. At the same time, GFS shares similarities to Troxler's fading and motion induced blindness. A recent study on the neuronal basis of GFS demonstrated that neuronal activity in early visual cortex was untouched by the perceptual effect, whereas neurons in higher areas altered their activity pattern during the illusion (Wilke et al. 2006). Authors report that the disappearance of the stimulus triggered changes in the local field potentials of all these areas, suggesting that the perception during flash suppression is reflected in large parts of the brain.

It was released in 1973 (see 1973 in country music) on the Epic Records label. Background After recording three duet albums together, country music's first couple finally scored a number one smash with \\"We're Gonna Hold On\\", a song Jones wrote with Earl Montgomery. The song's theme was the perseverance of love in the face of hardship, something that Jones and Wynette knew about all too well. As Bob Allen recounts in his book George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend, \\"Outside of a close circle of friends and business associates, few people realized the abject emotional squalor into which their marriage had sunk. The world at large was still deeply infatuated with their fame, their mansions and their expensive clothes and cars, and to fans, their marriage was still a precious thing indeed.\\" Joan Dew, the co-author of Wynette’s autobiography Stand By Your Man, speculated to Nick Tosches in 1994 that Tammy was not only distraught by George’s drinking but jaded by the marriage as well: \\"I think she really got bored with him very quick down there. George is a little fuddy-duddy...He sits around and watches TV all day and goes fishing. George is only exciting onstage.\\" In the BBC documentary Tammy Wynette: 'Til I Can Make It On My Own, Wynette's future husband George Richey recalled, \\"The writers who wrote for her, and there were about four of us who wrote regularly, would sort of write what was happening that day, and if she and Jones were having a tough time that's what we wrote about.\\" As their marriage became more turbulent, their audience's fascination only increased. The album cover - two separate, non- smiling photos of George and Tammy partially overlapping each other - contrasts significantly with the sleeves of their previous duet albums. The title song \\"We're Gonna Hold On\\" hit number 1 on Oct 27 1973 (for 2 weeks) and \\"(We're Not) The Jet Set\\" was a minor hit, reaching number 15. Reception AllMusic: \\"...by this point, the two had become a part of the touring machine and the album seems to be built around a stage show. The songs, outside of the title track (a number one hit), aren't particularly memorable.\\"  Track listing  # \\"We're Gonna Hold On\\" (George Jones, Earl Montgomery) 2:57 # \\"When True Love Steps In\\" (Carmol Taylor, Shirley Tackett) 2:09 # \\"Never Ending Song of Love\\" (Delaney Bramlett) 2:22 # \\"Wouldn't I\\" (Bobby Braddock, Curly Putman) 2:08 # \\"Roll in My Sweet Baby's Arms\\" (Lester Flatt) 2:48 # \\"(We're Not) The Jet Set\\" (Bobby Braddock) 2:25 # \\"Crawdad Song\\" (Billy Sherrill) 2:33 # \\"If Loving You Starts Hurting Me\\" (George Richey, Earl Montgomery, Carl Montgomery) 2:55 # \\"That Man of Mine\\" (Joyce McCord) 2:09 # \\"Woman Loves Me Right\\" (Earl Montgomery) 2:51 # \\"As Long as We Can\\" (Agnes Wilson, Roni Rivers) 2:32 References External links * George Jones' Official Website * Tammy Wynette's Official Site * Record Label Category:1973 albums Category:George Jones albums Category:Tammy Wynette albums Category:Albums produced by Billy Sherrill Category:Epic Records albums Category:Vocal duet albums ","title":"We're Gonna Hold On"},{"id":"9507041","text":"Finlyandsky (masculine), Finlyandskaya (feminine), or Finlyandskoye (neuter) may refer to: *Finlyandsky Municipal Okrug, a municipal okrug of Kalininsky District of the federal city of St. Petersburg, Russia *Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal), a rail terminal in St. Petersburg, Russia ","title":"Finlyandsky"},{"id":"9507045","text":"Mt. Kisco Elementary School Bedford Central School District is a school district located approximately 50 minutes north of New York City in northern Westchester County, New York, United States. The Bedford Central School District is composed of seven schools - Fox Lane High School, Fox Lane Middle School, Bedford Village Elementary School, Bedford Hills Elementary School, West Patent Elementary School, Pound Ridge Elementary School, and Mt. Kisco Elementary School - serving students from Bedford Hills, Mt. Kisco, Bedford Village, Pound Ridge, and Bedford Corners. Each elementary school serves one town/village/hamlet, except for West Patent, which serves Bedford Hills and Bedford Corners. The middle school, the high school, and the Bedford Central School District administrative buildings are all on the Fox Lane High School campus, near Interstate 684. The campus includes three soccer fields, a multipurpose astroturf field, a track that encircles the multipurpose field, and several baseball diamonds. The superintendent of the district is Dr. Christopher Manno, from New Jersey. Restoration and renovation Several old school buildings within the district were in a state of disrepair, including West Patent Elementary School and Fox Lane Middle School. Both were in need of new roofs, electrical work and more. On October 22, 2013, voters in the Town of Bedford who were members of the Bedford Central School District approved a $31,828,238 Capital Improvement Project proposed by the Bedford Central School District. The approval was by a wide margin. A total of 1,825 votes were cast, with 1,197 votes in favor and 628 votes against. The Capital Improvement Project will be funded with a combination of short-term notes and long-term bonds, and with an intent to minimize the increase in tax levy to homeowners and the length of time during which the dollar amount of that increase will apply. The project was slated to begin as soon as possible, and was expected to be completed in 2016. Large portions of the plan call for renovations at West Patent Elementary School and the Fox Lane Campus. These were to include renovations for the purpose of complying with the Americans With Disabilities Act, roof replacements and other structural renovations identified as necessary in the course of a years-long study. Allocations will also be made towards roofing replacements at Bedford Hills Elementary School, Bedford Village Elementary School and Pound Ridge Elementary School. 2020 coronavirus closures On March 11, 2020, BCSD officials announced the entire school district would be closed for the following two days as a precautionary measure due to a staff member from Fox Lane Middle School being placed under self-quarantine while awaiting testing for the coronavirus. It was later announced on March 13 that the school district would remain closed through April 3.

It is the only high school in the Clay Local School District. Clay is a rural high school serving about 300 students in grades 7-12 in Southern Ohio. The first class graduated in 1940. Clay High School is now part of one building serving students in PK-12. The old high school building was one of three buildings used in the district from 1956 to 2010. Rubyville Elementary School (4-6), which was on Maple Benner Road at the intersection of State Route 139, and Rosemount Primary School (K-3), which was on Rose Valley Road just off Rosemount Road in Rosemount, Ohio, were the other two buildings. General information The enrollment for Clay Junior-Senior High School, grades 7-12, is 300 with 190 students in grades nine through twelve. The school's mascot is the black panther while the school colors are royal blue and gold. Ninety-six (96.22) percent of the students that attend the school are white. The other four percent are Hispanic (1.15), African American (.82), multiracial (.82), Asian (.66), or American Indian (.33). The district covers . There are twenty-two full-time faculty members serving the 300 students. The athletes complete in the small division in every Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) sport. The school competes with ten (10) sports teams at the high school level and three at the junior high level. The school belongs to the OHSAA and to the Southern Ohio Conference - Division I (SOC I). The district received communication from the Ohio School Facilities Commission on May 3, 2007, that the district had been approved for the state funds. After new Ohio legislation allowing the district to proceed, a bond issue was placed on the March 2008 ballot to build a new preK-12 facility. The ballot issue passed and the district began building a new facility. The actual groundbreaking was in the Spring of 2009. Rubyville Elementary (served as Clay High School from 1940 to 1956) The Clay Township High School was built as part of the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. At the time Harold L. Ickes was the administrator of the Public Works program. Brief history The Clay Local School District was created in 1940 to serve the residents of Clay Township and the individual communities of Eden Park, Rosemount, Rubyville, and Twin Valley. For those students who desired to go on to high school before the opening of the high school in 1940, the board of education provided their tuition to Glenwood High School or to Portsmouth High School. When the school was built in 1940 \\"there were buses to transport students to and from school, but there was no cafeteria, therefore, students brought their lunches.\\" The first graduating class in 1940 was nicknamed the \\"Dirty Dozen\\" because there were twelve students who walked across the stage for the first time as Clay graduates. The district began with four buildings - one high school and three elementary schools. There were two buildings in Rubyville - the Rubyville Elementary building, which served as the high school from 1940–1956, and an elementary building (originally Sumers, later renamed Long Run School), which is now a local church. The district also had an elementary building in Eden Park, which still stands but is no longer used by the district, and one in Rosemount (Scioto Trail School), which was located on the current site of JW Village Market. In 1956, the Rubyville building (built in 1939) became the elementary building. With a bond issue to raise $325,000 (along with matching funds from the state and federal government for a total cost of nearly $600,000) a new high school building, which opened its doors on February 1, 1956, was built on Clay High Street. Mr. Carl Bandy was the Executive Head of the Clay (Rural) Local School District when the high school was built in 1955 . At that time, the enrollment of the district was 719. One year later, it was 915. During the period of peak employment at the Atomic Plant in Piketon (now U.S.E.C.), the enrollment was 1100. A new elementary building was then built in Rosemount (Rosemount Primary, built in 1964). The district no longer uses these three buildings. At the time the Rosemount building was constructed in 1964, a band room and a junior high wing were added to the high school. In 1998 an additional \\"wing\\" was built on to the high school structure. Additional upgrades and renovations have occurred to all three buildings over the years including improvements to the high school gym, new science laboratories, renovations to all the restroom facilities, new roofs, and air conditioning for all three buildings. The enrollment for the district is currently 717. Campus Clay Junior-Senior High School (aerial view, fall of 2003) Clay Junior-Senior High School (aerial view, fall of 2003) Clay Junior-Senior High School is located in the rolling hills of Southern Ohio (Appalachian Ohio) just north of the Ohio River near Portsmouth. The building and grounds are located on Clay High Street just off U.S. Route 23 and Lochner Road in Rosemount, which is nestled in a rural, community area of apartments, small businesses, homes, and farmland. The campus consists of several acres in which PK-12 building and several athletic fields (baseball and soccer) are located. The old Clay Jr.-Sr. High School building was shaped somewhat as an \\"E\\" (facing east) from an aerial view. In the middle of the vertical arm was the main entrance, which faced west toward U.S. Route 23. The industrial arts and drafting rooms were located in the top wing while the lower arm (or \\"old junior high\\" wing) housed additional academic classrooms. The middle wing consisted of the cafeteria, band room, gymnasium, health facility, and the \\"new junior high\\" wing. There were twenty-seven academic classrooms in the Clay High School building including three computer labs, an industrial arts shop and drafting room, a chemistry/physics lab, a biology lab, and a home economics lab. The district's superintendent and treasurer also have offices in the building. The CHS softball field is located on the grounds of the former Rubyville Elementary building. The school has new tennis courts (as of 2019) located on Rose Valley Road behind where the old Rosemount Elementary stood. Academics Academically, Clay has a reputation as one of the better schools in Southern Ohio. The latest Ohio Department of Education report card indicated CHS met the graduation, AYP (average yearly progress), and attendance percentages/rates. The school year is divided into two semesters for grading and course scheduling purposes, with a three-day finals schedule at the end of the year (see Academic term). The majority of the courses offered are year-long courses, but students have the opportunity to take a few courses on a semester basis. The school currently meets on a 47-minute, eight- period schedule in which students attend each class daily. While student enrollment (198) and class sizes are small (17:1), Clay offers many opportunities for its students including both curricular and extracurricular activities. These academic opportunities include, but are not limited to, AP courses, Art I-IV, band, Chemistry I & II, chorus, computer applications, pre- engineering courses, economics, industrial arts, physics, senior composition, Spanish I-IV, and web page design. Recent graduates of CHS have attended/graduated from such universities/colleges as Berea College, Eastern Kentucky University, Marshall University, Miami University, Morehead State University, Northern Kentucky University, Ohio University, Ohio Northern University, Purdue University, Shawnee State University, The Ohio State University, Transylvania University, University of Cincinnati, University of Kentucky, Valparaiso University, St. Bonaventure University, the University of Dayton, Cornell University, West Point, Wittenberg University, and Wright State University. Clay's graduating classes, which average about 35 students, have received in excess of $300,000 each year in scholarship money. The 2007 Clay graduating class, for example, was offered close to $450,000 in scholarships. Likewise, the CHS staff members have also attended/graduated from many of these same institutions. The CHS staff members have an average of 16 years of experience. Extracurricular activities * Athletic: Baseball, boys' and girls' basketball, boys' and girls' cross country, boys' golf, boys' soccer, fast-pitch softball, boys' tennis, boys' and girls' track and field, and girls' volleyball. * Other activities: Academic competition team (quiz bowl), band, Bible Club, cheerleading, Encore (show choir), CHS National Honor Society, the Clay Pep Club, student council, the venturing club, and the PNN news team. * Community & school-related service activities: American Red Cross blood drives, CF (cystic fibrosis) walks, health fairs, political campaigns, Sierra's Haven, and other acts of volunteerism. =Athletics= Clay Junior- Senior High School is a \\"small division\\" school in every Ohio High School Athletic Association sports' division. The school participates in twelve OHSAA sanctioned sports - baseball, boys' and girls' basketball, boys' and girls' cross country, boys' golf, boys' soccer, girls' fast pitch softball, boys' tennis, boys' and girls' track and field, and girls' volleyball. The district also fields boys' and girls' basketball, boys' and girls' cross country, boys' and girls' track and field, and girls' volleyball teams in our junior high. The district also has baseball, golf, and softball as sports at the junior high level even though these teams are not recognized as official school teams. There are ten school districts and eleven high schools in Scioto County along with one parochial school as well as several private and community schools. The school's athletic affiliation is with the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) and the Southern Ohio Conference (SOC), which has seventeen member schools and is divided into two divisions (SOC I & SOC II) based on the schools' enrollment. The SOC includes teams from four different Ohio counties - Jackson County (Oak Hill High School), Lawrence County (Saint Joseph Central High School and Symmes Valley High School), Pike County (Waverly High School, Eastern High School, and Western High School), and Scioto County (Clay High School, Green High School, Glenwood High School, Sciotoville Community School, Valley High School, Northwest High School, Minford High School, Portsmouth West High School, Notre Dame High School, South Webster High School, and Wheelersburg High School). See also Ohio High School Athletic Conferences and the Southern Ohio Conference Softball In athletics, the Clay softball team has won three OHSAA State Championships—1980, 1981, & 1983. The team was 79-1 in those three years under the direction of Carol Vice, a member of the Clay Coaches' Hall of Fame. In 1979 and 1988, the softball team was runner-up. The softball team has won 23 league titles, 29 sectional titles, 20 district titles, and ten regional titles along with three state championship banners. The softball team is the only team from Scioto County ever to win a state championship. In fact, the team was in the Final Four in nine out of the 11 years from 1978 to 1988. Carol and Clay Vice have their names/stars on the Portsmouth Wall of Fame in honor of their success and contributions to the Portsmouth area. The team's last appearance in the state tournament was in 2007. Boys' basketball The boys' basketball team made it to the OHSAA Final Four in 1969 under the direction of Arch Justus, who is also a member of the Clay Coaches' Hall of Fame and the Ohio Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame. The team has also won 14 league titles (most recently in 2004-5), 23 sectional titles, three district titles, and one regional title. Girls' basketball The girls' basketball team went to the OHSAA Final Four in 1980.

Terawhiti Station has seen a diverse range of land uses over the past 160 years. Originally a cattle station, Terawhiti grew into one of New Zealand's largest sheep stations before returning to cattle in 1993. The station originally consisted of the upraised marine terrace at Tongue Point on Wellington's south coast and was purchased by two Wellington businessmen Samuel Revans and William Mein Smith following the sale of Crown 'waste lands'. Captain William Barnard Rhodes later bought Revans’s land at Tongue Point stocking it with shorthorn cattle. His young manager, James McMenamen (known as Terawhiti Jack), later bought the Tongue Point farm and neighbouring blocks, forming Terawhiti Station and (later) Te Kamaru Station (at Te Ika a maru Bay). Today the station is approximately in size, running from Te Ika a Maru Bay in the north, down to Karori Stream in the south and Cape Terawhiti in the West. The area boasts a rich and varied history. Gold mining was prominent on the station during the 19th century. The first alluviel 'rush' began in the 1850s, while the more concerted effort to extract gold from Cape Terawhiti followed in the 1880s. The latter of which failed to provide an economic return. Problems arose when miners encountered the fragmented geological landforms that make up much of the Wellington region. While payable quartz veins, containing gold, would be located, these seams come to an abrupt end, making mining a fragmented, and expensive exercise. This eventually caused the demise of gold mining on Cape Terawhiti. The company to expend the most amount of time and money into the Terawhiti goldfield was the Albion Gold Mining Company. The Albion Battery, built in 1883, is one of the last remaining remnants of the short-lived gold rush. The farm still remains in the family of James McMenamen's descendants. Wind farming is seen as a new chapter of land-use in the ongoing story of survival in this harsh landscape. Meridian Energy completed the 62 turbine Project West Wind in 2009 in Mākara over the combined project area of Terawhiti Station and Makara Farm. The energy produced by Project West Wind has a capacity of 143 MW – enough power for all the houses in Wellington City, Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt and Porirua.

In 1864 the band was created from an orchestra known in Italian as La Filarmonica del Zurrico. In 1944 the bandmaster was Espedito Deguara, a well known musician in Malta. The band has played concerts abroad in the following places: * Noto, Sicily, Italy (1954) * Acireale, Sicily (1955) * Catania, Sicily (1959) * Bari, Apulia, Italy (1997) * Lucca, Tuscany, Italy (2004) * Budapest, Hungary (2009) * Black Forest, Germany (2014) In 1986 the band came under the direction of Francis Falzon, who was the bandmaster until his death on 26 October 2009. In the same year the St. Catherine Fireworks Factory was established. In the first week of September, 2005, the band celebrated the 1,700th anniversary of the martyrdom of St Catherine, the patron saint of Zurrieq. For this occasion a new store and pedestal were inaugurated. The Feast of St Catherine is celebrated every year in the first week of September and lasts the whole week. Itis considered one of the best festivals in the Maltese Islands, especially when it comes to outdoor celebrations such as the traditional marches and the decorations which dominate Zurrieq throughout the whole week. The band \\"Socjeta Muzikali Santa Katarina\\" is as well very popular both in Malta and overseas especially in Italy. It was invited 5 times in different regions of Italy and clearly leaving an impact. In fact this band club is at present the 3rd largest (feast) band in Malta with more than 80 residential musicians. The pace at which this band is growing is impressive. In 2006 the band had 33 students learning to become band musician known as \\"allevi\\".

He excelled in art as a youth, and after graduating from school he was accepted into the Imperial School of Art in Vilna.  Immigration to the United States  Stillman immigrated to the United States after less than two years at the Imperial School, landing in Sioux City, Iowa at the age of 16. He worked in a local jewelry store to pay the bills, but spent every moment he could painting. After a short stint at the Art Institute of Chicago, Ary once again was on the move, relocating to New York City in 1919 at the age of 28. In New York, he studied at the National Academy of Design (the predecessor of what is now the National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts).  The Paris years  Never one to let grass beneath his feet, Ary once again moved in 1921, this time to Paris, where he lived and worked for 12 years. He experienced commercial and artistic success in Paris, including a one-man show at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune and regular exhibits at the Salon d'Automne, Salon des Echanges (1932), Salone National des Beaux-Arts and the Salon de Tulleries. Although his work had been largely objective until the early 1930s, a careful study of his early art reveals the roots of his later abstract work and shows his interest in the artistic arrangement of shapes to convey a subjective meaning.  The Holocaust triggers a move towards abstract art  Ary Stillman returned to New York in 1933 as a successful and well-known artist. Among other galleries, from 1935-1937 Ary exhibited at the Guild Art Gallery owned and directed by Margaret Lefranc. His work during this time became more subjective (although still representational). At this time Ary became more concerned with his interpretation of the deeper inner content of his subject, and less interested with its objective outer form. When the horrors of the Holocaust were revealed, Ary abruptly shifted his focus to abstract works, and by 1948, his work was completely non-objective. During the early 1950s Ary had a one-person show every year at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery in New York City.  Later life  In the mid-1950s after becoming almost blind in one eye and losing his treasured Manhattan studio to city developers, Ary became depressed. He couldn’t seem to find the right environment to help him out of his depression, trying Paris, Majorca and New York before moving to Mexico in early 1957. He lived and worked in Mexico for five years, returning to the United States and settling in Houston (where his sister lived), where he lived out the rest of his days. Ary Stillman died in 1967. Upon his death, the Stillman-Lack foundation was found, in accordance with his instructions, to preserve his work and make it available.  Ary Stillman at Columbia University  In 2010 Columbia University received from the Stillman-Lack Foundation a collection of art works by Stillman, making Columbia the largest international repository of his works. Of the ninety painting and drawings donated to the University, twenty-five have been allocated as gifts to graduating doctoral candidates in the Department of Art History and Archaeology who are recipients of a Stillman fellowship. The remaining sixty- five paintings, drawings, watercolors, and prints are part of the University art collection, housed in and stewarded by Art Properties, Avery Library.

Biography St. Peter Claver School for Boys Johnston was born July 13, 1929 on the Parry Island Indian Reserve to Rufus and Mary (née Lafrenière) Johnston. He was a member of the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation, formerly Cape Croker (Neyaashiinigmiing), in the Bruce Peninsula. Johnston was educated in reserve schools in Cape Croker and later sent, along with his sister Marilyn, to residential school in Spanish, Ontario. He wrote about his experience as a student at St. Peter Claver School for Boys in his 1988 book Indian School Days. After graduating high school as class valedictorian, he earned his B.A. with Honours from Loyola College (1954) and a high school teaching certificate from the Ontario College of Education (1962). In 1959, Johnston married Lucie Desroches, with whom he had three children – Miriam, Tibby and Geoffery. Johnston died in 2015 at Wiarton, Ontario. Before his death he donated his papers, including photographs, correspondence and manuscripts to the McMaster University Library for use by researchers in the William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections. =Teaching= Johnston taught high school at Earl Haig Secondary School in North York, Ontario, from 1962 to 1969, before taking a position in the Ethnology Department of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. Part of his focus during his 25 years with the museum was the regeneration of the language, values and beliefs of Anishinaabe heritage. He developed an extensive series of Ojibwa language courses on tape and in print, believing that traditional language education was essential to understanding Indigenous culture. In the 1990 essay \\"One Generation From Extinction\\" he examined the essential role Indigenous language and literature play in restoring lost \\"Indianness\\". Of the impacts of lost language he explains: =Writing= Johnston wrote extensively in both English and Ojibwa.

His first book Ojibway Heritage was published in 1976 thanks to the support of Jack McClelland and Anna Porter of McClelland & Stewart. In 1978 Porter proved equally instrumental, fighting for the publication of Johnston's second book, Moose Meat and Wild Rice, after a McClelland & Stewart editor suggested the publisher pass on the title, in part, because stories of its kind were \\"currently passé.\\" The book, which was nominated for a Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour, comprised 22 fictional short-stories and offered satirical comment about the relationship between Indigenous peoples, government officials and the nature of acculturation. Awards Johnston was honoured with numerous awards for his work in preserving Ojibwa language and culture in addition to Honorary Doctorates from the University of Toronto, Laurentian University and Brandon University. *Order of Ontario (1989) *125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal (1992) *National Aboriginal Achievement Award for Heritage and Spirituality (2004) *Debwewin Citation for excellence in storytelling (2012) *Ontario Arts Council Aboriginal Arts Award (2013) *National Aboriginal Achievement Award for Heritage and Spirituality (2014) Bibliography * North American Indians: outline.

John Mauceri led the orchestra from its founding in 1990 until he stepped down after the 2006 Hollywood Bowl season. During this time, his titles included Conductor, Principal Conductor, and finally, Director. He now holds the title of Founding Director. In March 2008, Thomas Wilkins was named Principal Guest Conductor of the orchestra for a two- year contract beginning in Summer of 2008. The contract was extended multiple times until 2014 when Wilkins was promoted to \\"Principal Conductor.\\"  Musicians and cross-over with other orchestras  The Hollywood Bowl Orchestra has 80-100 players drawn from the large pool of world-class freelance musicians in the Southern California area, many of whom perform regularly with movie studios, regional orchestras, and other entertainment-related organizations. There is no cross-over between the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra musicians and the regular roster of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. This is in notable contrast to the Boston Pops Orchestra which draws its players directly from the Boston Symphony (i.e. the Boston Symphony without its principal players), or the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra which is simply the Cincinnati Symphony playing under a different name.  History  Since 1922 orchestras performed regularly at the Bowl, primarily drawn from the Los Angeles area. In 1927 a \\"Hollywood Bowl Orchestra\\" was established under conductor Eugene Goossens. The orchestra made a series of recordings for Victor in 1928 issued as \\"Symphonies under the Stars\\" notable for being recorded in the open air. Guest conductors of these events included Alfred Hertz, Ossip Gabrilowitsch, Bruno Walter, Pierre Monteux, Pietro Crimini, Modest Altschuler, Adolf Tandler, and Vladimir Shavitch (in addition to Goossens). = Stokowski's orchestra = The first incarnation of a permanent orchestra was in 1945 as the \\"Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra\\" under the direction of Leopold Stokowski. They had a number of recordings under Stokowski plus others under different conductors, including: * Music of George Gershwin with Felix Slatkin conducting and Leonard Pennario piano soloist * Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 with Vladimir Horowitz as soloist and William Steinberg conducting However, after only two seasons, the orchestra was disbanded, and all the summer orchestral concerts at the Hollywood Bowl were subsequently performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. However, another incarnation of the Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra continued into the 1950s and '60s, led by such conductors as Slatkin, Miklós Rózsa, Carmen Dragon, and Alfred Newman, and made numerous recordings for Capitol Records. = Re-establishment in 1990 = On October 17, 1990, the management of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association (LAPA) led by Ernest Fleischmann (LAPA Executive VP and Managing Director at the time) and John Mauceri, newly appointed Principal Conductor, held a press conference announcing the formation of a second orchestra under its auspices, this time titled \\"Hollywood Bowl Orchestra.\\" There were four primary reasons for its existence: * Relieve the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra some of its responsibilities of playing weekend concerts at the Hollywood Bowl during the summer. * Reinvent the \\"pops\\" format. During the announcement, both Fleischmann and Mauceri took great pains to avoid the term \\"pops\\" in relation to the orchestra and/or its repertoire. Mauceri said, \\"This is something unique in our century, that there seems to be a division between music that is 'popular' and music that is 'serious.' This ensemble will cut across these artificial barriers to become an orchestra for all tastes.\\" The HBO would be dedicated to the preservation of American musical heritage from movies to musicals to the concert hall. * Record this reinvented pops repertoire. At the press conference, the orchestra announced that it had signed a 15-CD recording contract with Philips Classics; in fact, Fleischmann noted that the impetus for forming the orchestra began when Philips lost its recording contract with the Boston Pops to Sony Classical. * Tour internationally, with the first tour set for Japan in December 1991. = Mauceri Years = The first public performances by the orchestra were for Independence Day concerts on July 2–4, 1991 at the Hollywood Bowl with Mauceri conducting and Bruce Hubbard (baritone) as soloist. The program included works by Aaron Copland, Leonard Bernstein, John Williams, George Gershwin, and Jerome Kern among others. John Henken's concert review in the Los Angeles Times praised Mauceri for choosing \\"an Americana program that was nicely paced, reasonably varied and made musical as well as patriotic points. More important still, he got his orchestra to project it all with exuberance and flair.\\" During Mauceri's tenure, he and the orchestra largely fulfilled the goals announced when the orchestra was founded. * They performed a wide variety of repertoire, from Broadway musicals to traditional \\"classical\\" works including concert performances of full operas. Mauceri frequently conducted classic and contemporary motion picture scores, and performed and recorded compositions for the concert hall by musicians traditionally known only as \\"film composers\\" such as Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Miklos Rozsa, Dimitri Tiomkin, and Alfred Newman. He even re-introduced forgotten music, including the \\"Fanfare for the Hollywood Bowl\\" by Arnold Schoenberg. He became known for speaking to the audience from the stage about the evening's performance in an easy-going, educational, and entertaining way. And he began every concert by saying, \\"I'm John Mauceri. And this is the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra.\\" * They made 13 recordings for Philips. Among their recordings of their stated repertoire, most noteworthy is \\"The King and I,\\" with Julie Andrews and Ben Kingsley in the lead roles, Lea Salonga, Peabo Bryson, and Marilyn Horne in supporting roles, and film stars Roger Moore and Martin Sheen in special cameo appearances. This was the first recording in 35 years to use the original orchestrations of the Academy Award-winning movie version. The recording was No. 1 on the Billboard classical crossover chart in only its second week of release, and also received Billboard's 1993 Crossover CD of the Year award. * They had a number of tours: New Year's Eve concerts December 1991, 1993, 1995, and 1997 in Japan, and November 1996 concerts in Brazil. From among the Orchestra's more than 300 concerts, Kathleen Battle, Plácido Domingo, Jane Eaglen, Marilyn Horne, Alexander Frey, Jennifer Larmore, Sylvia McNair, Andrea Bocelli, Gil Shaham, Stephen Hough, Luciano Pavarotti and the San Francisco Ballet represent the illustrious talent from the worlds of opera, ballet and classical music that has graced the stage with the Orchestra. Trisha Yearwood, Garth Brooks (in his only performance with an orchestra) and the late John Denver brought to their performances the irrepressible optimism of Country- Western. Jason Alexander, Carol Burnett, Kristin Chenoweth, Kirk Douglas, Patti LuPone, Reba McEntire, Lynn Redgrave, Peabo Bryson, Harry Connick Jr., Alan Cumming, Davis Gaines, Savion Glover, Joel Grey, Garrison Keillor, Leonard Nimoy, Brian Stokes Mitchell and Patrick Stewart have brought their inimitable gifts to the Bowl stage. Hosting Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Chicago, Cheap Trick, The Chieftains, Sergio Mendes, The Moody Blues, Pink Martini, Tito Puente and the Latin Jazz Ensemble, Royal Crown Revue, and Rufus Wainwright, the Orchestra has proven itself in the world of pop and rock. Rosemary Clooney, Natalie Cole, Ann Miller, Della Reese, Sir George Martin, and Peter, Paul & Mary are among artists with whom the Orchestra has been privileged to work. And, in the 1999 season, John Mauceri stepped aside to allow the mayor of Los Angeles, the Honorable Richard J. Riordan, to make his conducting debut at the Bowl with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra.

It continues the story of RAF Hornet Squadron, now posted to North Africa in 1942, during a lull in the fighting. Some of the characters from the previous novel, such as Squadron Leader \\"Fanny\\" Barton and erudite but iconoclastic intelligence officer \\"Skull\\" Skelton, reprise their roles. As the squadron engages in increasingly suicidal ground attacks in an effort to lure the Luftwaffe into a fight, Captain Jack Lampard leads an SAS patrol behind enemy lines and Paul Schramm, a German intelligence officer, tries to concoct his own scheme to beat the SAS at their own game.  Hornet Squadron  The fictional RAF Hornet Squadron features in several novels by Derek Robinson, most notably Piece of Cake, which detailed their service during the first year of the Second World War. In that novel the squadron was equipped with the Hawker Hurricane, but by the time of A Good Clean Fight they have been replaced with the Curtiss P-40 Tomahawks and Kittyhawks. Many of the surviving characters from the previous novel return, including: \\"Fanny\\" Barton, the squadron's young New Zealander commanding officer; \\"Pip\\" Patterson, a Scottish pilot who has been promoted to Flight Lieutenant; \\"Skull\\" Skelton, a former Cambridge University don who serves as the squadron's intelligence officer and voices many unpopular theories about the war; and Flight Lieutenant \\"Uncle\\" Kellaway, the squadron's adjutant and a veteran of the First World War. Unusual for a Derek Robinson novel, A Good Clean Fight also features other branches of the armed forces, such as a patrol of the Special Air Service (SAS), as well as several characters from the Luftwaffe and Afrikakorps. Plot summary A Good Clean Fight is set in North Africa in the spring of 1942. The British 8th Army is fighting against Axis forces advancing across Libya towards Egypt. Captain Lampard of the British SAS has led a motorised patrol across the inland ‘sand seas’ to penetrate deep behind German lines. Lampard is a brave officer but he has a serious flaw, a tendency to be overly reckless and to bite off more than he can chew. Infiltrating a German Luftwaffe base at Barce, Lampard's patrol destroy dozens of aircraft without a single casualty. They also capture a Luftwaffe intelligence officer, Major Paul Schramm. Whilst the patrol are hiding from a German plane, Schramm escapes on foot. Lampard sends Corporal Harris out after him but by sheer fluke, Schramm manages to kill his pursuer. The Major makes it back to Barce and he takes off as a passenger in a Fieseler Fi 156 Storch to search for the SAS patrol. They find Lampard's force but the SAS soldiers damage the plane with gunfire, forcing it to crash-land, leaving Schramm injured. Lampard, disregarding warnings from his men, brings his patrol close to a known enemy base. They are fired upon by Italian troops, killing one of Lampard's men. The patrol enjoys a break in Cairo. Lampard indulges in a favourite pastime of seducing the wives of officers who have recently been killed. Whilst bedding one widow, an Australian officer who is another of her lovers enters the apartment and in the ensuing confrontation, Lampard kills him. Anxious to avoid the repercussions for this act and for the errors he made on the previous patrol, Lampard eagerly volunteers to lead his men out on another sortie into the desert. Meanwhile, RAF Hornet Squadron arrives in Egypt under the command of New Zealander 'Fanny' Barton, a veteran of the Battles of France and Britain. Since 1940, Barton has become ruthlessly ambitious. Amongst his pilots are 'Pip' Patterson, another veteran, but who, unlike Barton, is war-weary. Adjutant Kellaway and Intelligence Officer 'Skull' Skelton are also present. Barton, eager to make a name for himself, proposes to take Hornet Squadron, equipped with US-built Curtiss Tomahawks, out to a forward airstrip LG-181 and commence a campaign of low-level strafing attacks on enemy targets designed to provoke and draw the Luftwaffe into battle. The plan is approved. In Cairo, two war correspondents, Lester and Malpacket, ill- equipped to cope with the desert, are desperate for a news story that will give them a big scoop and entertain the readers back home. In Libya, Schramm is treated for his injuries by an Italian doctor Maria Grandinetti, an attractive woman who is a fugitive from Mussolini's regime. Schramm's humour and courage are shown to be a thin disguise for his fear and uncertainty and, despite his awkwardness, he is attracted to the cheerfully cynical doctor. Major Jakowski of the Afrika Korps is determined to tackle the SAS raiders head on by taking a large motorised column out into the desert. Days of fruitless searching prompts him to divide his force into two and the section that he leads, whilst driving at night, speeds over the rim of a crescent- shaped dune and most of it is wiped out in the fiery pile-up. The other section, under Captain Lessing, heads for home. Hornet Squadron begin to carry out low-level strafing attacks on a variety of enemy targets in Libya. Despite some initial success, heavy anti-aircraft fire and wear-and-tear soon take their toll of the squadron’s aircraft and Skelton tries to warn Barton that if he maintains the current pace of operations, Hornet squadron will soon be in no shape to take on the Luftwaffe if and when it rises to the bait. In desperation, Barton orders repeat-attacks on the same targets with the result that the enemy prepare heavier AA defences, culminating in the loss of five pilots in a single day. Adjutant Kellaway suffers a nervous breakdown. The remains of Hornet squadron are ordered to a new airstrip—LG 250—and converted to carry bombs. Lampard’s SAS patrol drives across the inland sand sea in a wide circle behind Axis lines, heading for Benghazi, with Lester and Malplacket. Meanwhile, Major Schramm comes up with a plan to match the boldness of the SAS by taking a single, long-range Heinkel He 111 bomber southwards to bomb the isolated but vital British supply bases along the Takoradi Trail. The trail is a long supply route stretching from the coast of Nigeria across central Africa to Cairo. Hornet Squadron, now re-equipped with newer Curtiss Kittyhawks, begin to attack German airfields and, as Barton had hoped from the start, the enemy Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters finally rise to do battle. However, Barton has a mere four pilots left with which to achieve his aims. And within days, two of the pilots are dead and a third, Pip Patterson, is wounded. Captain Lessing’s force encounters Lampard’s patrol and is virtually wiped out in a nighttime ambush. Leaving a detachment at a base camp, Lampard takes the rest of his men deeper into enemy territory with plans to attack the Luftwaffe base at Beda Fomm but just as they arrive, Barton and his last remaining pilot, American Hick Hooper, make a dive-bombing attack which puts the defences on full alert. Angered, the SAS patrol heads for an alternative target, the airfield at Barce where Major Schramm is based. Despite the Germans now being aware of their presence, Lampard recklessly presses on to reach the airfield and they wipe out two squadrons of Bf 109s. But it is now nearly dawn and the Germans are in hot pursuit. Confrontations with Italian CR-42 fighters and a convoy of German infantry sees the patrol lose nine men and all their vehicles, leaving only Lampard and two others alive. They manage to reach their base camp and rejoin the detachment that had been left there. Flown by an Italian pilot named Di Marco, Schramm’s Heinkel flies the long route to the British transit base at Fort Lamy in Chad. Due to its isolation, the base is undefended and caught by surprise, allowing the lone Heinkel to destroy months' worth of precious fuel and supplies along with nearly two dozen Hawker Hurricane fighters. Both Lampard and Barton receive instructions to seek and destroy the Heinkel. Lampard takes his remaining men and vehicles deeper into the desert to locate it. The Heinkel runs out of fuel short of the nearest Axis base at Defa and lands in the desert to await rescue. Lampard finds them first, resulting in a surprise meeting between him and Schramm. The SAS take the Heinkel crew as prisoners and head for home. But the P-40s flown by Barton and Hooper arrive. Mistaking the vehicles to be German, the two pilots strafe them, killing everyone. The two journalists Lester and Malpacket drive a Fiat truck into enemy-held Benghazi, bluffing their way past sentries to wander throughout the place without being challenged. En route home, the truck breaks down and the novel ends with the two men walking east through the desert with the little water they have left. At Paul Schramm's funeral, Maria Grandinetti reflects on their relationship: \\"I helped him to stop feeling sorry for himself and to stop being angry with everyone else. And I showed him a lot of dying men, so he could see that war is not adventure and that pain is not payment, because it buys nothing. He didn't believe me.\\" Critical reception Mike Petty, writing in the UK Independent in 1993, praised the novel, saying that Robinson \\"picks his way surefootedly through the quagmire of moral complications without ever resorting either to handwringing or to gung-ho posturing, and, most importantly, without devaluing bravery.\\" Category:1993 British novels Category:Novels set during World War II Category:Royal Air Force mass media Category:Fiction set in 1942 Category:Aviation novels Category:Novels set in Egypt Category:Novels set in Libya ","title":"A Good Clean Fight"},{"id":"9507339","text":"Blessed Catherine of Racconigi, T.O.S.D., (1486 - 1574, Racconigi) was an Italian member of the Third Order of St. Dominic, who is recognized for being a mystic and a stigmatic. Biography Most of the information regarding Catherine Mattei is derived from a vita written by her friend, John Francis Pico, Prince of Mirandola.O'Connor, R.F., \\"Blessed Catherine of Racconigi\\", The American Catholic Quarterly Review, (James Andrew Corcoran, Patrick John Ryan, Edmond Francis Prendergast eds.), Volume 41, p.211, Hardy and Mahony, Philadelphia, 1916 Catherine Mattei () was born in the Piedmont region of Northwest Italy in 1487 into an impoverished household in the Province of Cuneo. Intermittent conflicts in the area brought widespread poverty. Her parents were Giorgio and Bilia de Ferrari Mattei. Her father was an unemployed tool-maker, while her mother was a weaver who was able to support the family. Her father was often despondent and quarrelsome, thus the family environment was usually one of conflict. She is said to have had, at about the age of nine, a vision of Jesus, who appeared to her as a boy of about ten. She would also begin to have visions of other saints such as the Dominicans Catherine of Siena and Peter Martyr. The Virgin told her that Jesus wanted to have her as his Bride, as a token of which she was given a wedding ring, which she had all her life—but which only she could see. She began to have frequent ecstasies and visions of Jesus, who always appeared to her as the same age she was at the time of the vision. Many miracles would result from her visions: a broken dish was made whole again, and money and food would be provided when the family's poverty was extreme. In times of trial she received great consolation from the aspiration, \\"Jesus, is my only hope!\\" Blessed Catherine eventually joined the Dominican Order herself, but, like St. Catherine, she was opposed in this wish by her family. As a result, instead of entering a monastery of the cloistered nuns of the Order, she became a tertiary of the Order, continuing to live with her family. As the visions increased she received the stigmata, although, the wounds were not visible until after her death. Her mystical experiences roused a storm of gossip among her neighbors, who were terrified at the lights and sounds that came from her home; even the Dominican friars began to ostracize her. Eventually she was forced out of the town and settled in the city of Racconigi. During her lifetime, Catherine was sought for counsel and prayer. She would keep in her prayers in a special way the salvation of soldiers who were dying in battle. Veneration Many miracles took place before and after her death and her detractors came to acknowledge the holiness of her life. She was beatified in 1810 by Pope Pius VII.

The dish forms a directional antenna which is pointed at the wireless access point antenna, allowing reception of the wireless signal at greater distances than standard omnidirectional Wi-Fi antennas. Description WokFi antennas are fabricated out of commonly available concave metal kitchen dishes or dish covers (which need not be perfectly parabolic); Asian woks are favored because they have shapes closest to parabolic. A commercial Wi-Fi antenna, usually a USB Wi-Fi dongle, is suspended in front of the dish, attached by cable to the computer. The WokFi antenna is considered simpler and cheaper than other home-built antenna projects (such as the popular cantenna), but is a very effective method to boost the Wi-Fi connection quality, audit access point coverage, and even quickly establish WLAN viability – perhaps if a more professional setup is eventually intended. Advantages A significant advantage is that with a USB modem the RF signal is converted to a conventional digital signal at the antenna. Therefore, by using standard USB extension cables, the antenna can be located at a distance from the computer of five meters or more, with no concerns over microwave signal losses that would occur in an RF coaxial cable feedline of that length used to attach a conventional antenna to the RF input of a computer modem. Chaining active USB repeaters, it is possible to locate the antenna at much greater distances from the computer, which is especially useful when line-of-sight (LOS) obstacles (such as vegetation and walls) require the antenna to be located on a roof, for example. If using mesh reflectors, usually with a grid under 5 mm, the antenna will be lighter and present a smaller wind-load than larger dishes. Performance WokFi gains are typically 10+ dB, with range boosts, thus can be 16-32 times over the antenna of a bare USB adapter. Ranges (LoS) are typically 3–5 km (2 to 3 miles), although an aligned pair of similar point-to-point transceiver setups may approach 10 km (6 miles) over a clear path. In addition, certain improved WokFi antennas, and antennas made using 60 to 90 cm (2-3 ft) diameter round or oval satellite TV dishes, allow even far greater range, up to 20 km (12 miles). Interference from nearby 2.4 GHz signals (perhaps from cordless phones, AV links, leaky microwave ovens, other APs or Bluetooth) can be nulled out—a useful feature in this increasingly crowded part of the RF spectrum. The performance of abundant, low-powered Wi-Fi \\"dongles\\", typically selling for approximately US$15–20, but of only 30–40 mW transmitter power and modest receiver sensitivity, can easily be boosted with little more than cheap cookware or pot lids. The \\"sweet spot\\" on such ad hoc reflectors can readily be found by taping a small (~2.5 cm, or 1 in) mirror on the surface of the dish, to see where the sun's rays focus.

Located near the town centre on Castle Street, it is the only Catholic cathedral in the county; an older cathedral, now owned by the Church of Ireland and officially called The Cathedral Church of St. Eunan, is located in the town of Raphoe, about ten miles away. Letterkenny Cathedral was designed by William Hague from Cavan Town. It is built in the Victorian neo-Gothic style. The ceilings are the work of Amici of Rome, while the majestic stained glass windows that illuminate the Sanctuary and the Lady Chapel are by the Mayer firm of Munich. Another dominant building in the town is the historic St Eunan's College which was built as a seminary in 1906, using the money left over after the building of the Cathedral and the Parochial House. The college is a three-storey picturesque castle with four round towers at each corner of the building. The school is named after the Abbot of Iona St. Eunan, a native of Donegal and patron saint of the Diocese of Raphoe. It is an all-male education facility which today houses over 850 students. Conwal Parish Church The Donegal County Museum is housed in what remains of the old workhouse and is located on the High Road. It was built in 1843. Each year the museum attracts thousands of tourists, who seek to find out about the history of County Donegal, to the town. Trinity Presbyterian Church is located on Upper Main Street on the site of the earliest regular 'Meeting House' for Presbyterians, dated with a stone declaring the origin of the congregation in 1640. Presbyterianism in Letterkenny dates back more than 350 years when the Rev. William Semple officiated from 1648 to 1674. The 'Meeting House' then was also on the Main Street and was originally probably a large thatched building. The church adopted the name 'Trinity' in 1916. Conwal Parish Church is located opposite St Eunan's Cathedral. The Church dates back to the 17th Century. Parts of this Protestant church date from the mid- to late eighteenth-century. It was expanded and extensively altered in the 1860s. The building is believed to have been constructed when a church located at Conwal fell into ruins. The remains of Redmond O'Hanlon are also located on the church grounds. Rockhill House Rockhill House is located some two miles west of Letterkenny. It is a large classical house dating from the middle of the 18th century with additions in the early 19th century and with further additions from 1853. Its most recent use was by the Irish Defence Forces, who ceased using it as an army barracks in January 2009. Rockhill House is due to be transferred from its present owners, the Department of Defence, to Donegal Co. Council. A locally based group, the Rockhill House Heritage Association, has been campaigning to have it preserved and developed in a proper manner.http://www.donegalpeople.com Modern structures Letterkenny Library and Arts Centre An Grianán Theatre opened in October 1999. The Theatre is the largest theatre in Letterkenny and indeed in the whole of County Donegal.Largest theatre in County Donegal It is located on Port and has a seating capacity of 383. It also boasts the largest stage in Ireland. The Central Library and Arts Centre is located on the corner of St. Oliver Plunkett Street and Lower Main Street. The Centre opened in 1995 as part of the new Central Library building in Letterkenny, and is an integral part of Donegal County Council's arts provision. It was the first arts centre operated by a local council in the Republic of Ireland. In more recent years, Letterkenny has seen more unusual architectural development. The Letterkenny Town Council Offices, known locally as 'The Grasshouse' or 'The Grasshoose' or 'The Grass-Roof', were designed by Donegal-based Antoin MacGabhann Architects and opened in 2003. Standing at the edge of Letterkenny, it is considered by many tourists and locals to be one of the most unusual buildings to be erected in the county for many years. One of its most notable features is its distinctive sloping grass roof situated above a broad band of aluka matt cladding although it is also noticeable for its runway-like ramp to the first- floor concourse. It is said to be a building of international interest.Archiseek – In the ascendant Letterkenny Regional Cultural Centre is a cultural centre located behind An Grianán Theatre in the town and is one of the leading cultural centres in the west of Ulster. The centre was launched on 7 July 2007 and opened on 9 July 2007. The flagship facility was designed by Letterkenny-based MacGabhann Architects and is situated on the site of the old council offices. The offices were destroyed in an arson attack but the building has now been transformed into a modern two-storey glass building. Letterkenny Regional Sports and Leisure Complex is a sports complex located near the town centre. The complex is located near O'Donnell Park and the total cost of the building of the complex was €22.7 million. Construction of the building began in 2002. An open day for the complex was held on 18 and 19 May 2007 and the complex opened to the public on Monday 9 July 2007. =Legal buildings= Allied Irish Bank The Courthouse (1829) dominates the Upper Main Street. However, it is not actually on the Main Street itself, being located just off it. The Allied Irish Bank (1835) building (formerly the Royal Bank of Ireland) on Upper Main Street is another notable structure in the town. Like many provincial Irish towns, Letterkenny has a number of fine buildings housing banks. The Bank of Ireland (1874), designed by Timothy Hevey, is one such structure in the town. Located at the edge of the Market Square on the Main Street, it was originally constructed for the (now defunct) Hibernian Bank. =Hospitals= St Conal's Hospital was built in the early 1860s. It is located across the way from Letterkenny University Hospital and overlooks the Town Park. Today it also houses the HSE's dental clinics, physiotherapy units and mental health facilities. Georgian architecture A Georgian terrace at Mount Southwell Terrace. Much Georgian architecture was evident in the town from about the 1800s onwards. Although some has since been demolished, much is still to be found. A terrace of three-storey Georgian townhouses may be found at Mount Southwell Terrace, near St Eunan's Cathedral, towards the centre of the town. More Georgian architecture may be found south of the town centre. Bridges The town is located on the River Swilly and provides the last bridge crossing points before the river flows into Lough Swilly, a 50 km glacial fjord. As such, Letterkenny's bridges are of vital importance to the area. The Port Bridge is the last crossing of the Swilly before the Lough and carries the N14 National Primary Road over the River Swilly, linking the Port Road to the Derry Road. The N14 is the main route of access to Letterkenny from the rest of Ireland and is therefore a vital transport artery for the town and northwest Donegal (via the N56 National Primary Road). The bridge comprises three large-diameter culverts of corrugated steel construction. The Oldtown Bridge was the first bridge built across the Swilly. It is located about 2 km upstream from the Port Bridge and is the oldest extant bridge in Letterkenny. The Oldtown Bridge carries the L1114 over the River Swilly, which was the original road access route from Letterkenny to the south and east. The bridge connects the Oldtown area to the town centre and provides an alternative route to Newmills and Rockhill House. The Oldtown Bridge is of stone arched construction. Devlin Way was the first pedestrian-only bridge built over the River Swilly. The bridge was installed just upstream of the Oldtown Bridge and connects the suburban Oldtown area with the town centre. It was designed by local TS McLaughlin Structural Engineers and the ironwork was constructed by Bonnar Engineering. The bridge cost €100,000 to construct. A maroon-coloured cambered steel structure which measures 28 metres long and 2.2 metres wide, the new bridge proves a major impact on the safety of pedestrians, especially OAPs and school-going children. It is lit by lamp cast from iron and it also contains a commemorative stone seat with a plaque. The bridge is neighbour to the much older and well known Oldtown Bridge. The bridge was officially opened by local councillor Ciaran Brogan. It is named in honour of the Devlin family who live beside the bridge. The Railway Bridge is visible from Devlin Way. The bridge was constructed for the Burtonport Extension of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway network. Railway operations ceased on the line in 1940. The span is provided by two above-deck steel trusses.

It stars Cole Pensinger and Anna Kavan. The film and director have also been mentioned by the media as an important part of the \\"mumblecore\\" movement in independent cinema. Plot Apathetic 17-year-old Gus spends most of his time hanging around doing nothing with his buddy Bill. Gus likes to tell half-true stories about all the girls he has slept with and all the drugs he has done. Jessica is seventeen too. She seems not to have much in common with anyone anymore – not even her best friend Christie. Every year Brian throws a 4th of July party. The party is never great, but there is free beer, so people always go. Gus and Jessica meet each other there. They watch fireworks outside and light sparklers. Gus says that he is not the sort of guy she thinks he is. He tells her a secret he has never told anyone before.  Production  The film took nearly two years to complete. Katz explained the reason for such as being due to the film's editor, Zach Clark, living in Virginia while he lived in Brooklyn. Clark would send edited footage on a DVD to Katz, who would then respond by sending notes to Clark.  Release  The film debuted at the 2006 South by Southwest Film Festival and subsequently played at almost a dozen other festivals around the country and a two-week exclusive run at the Pioneer Theatre in New York City.  Reception  The New York Times stated that \\"Dance Party USA is a remarkably delicate construction, directed with extraordinary empathy by Aaron Katz.\\" In addition, The New York Sun placed it at number nine on their Top 10 Films of 2006 list and critic Amy Taubin lauded it in Art Forum, saying it was \\"in her pantheon of coming of age films.\\" References External links * Category:2006 films Category:2000s coming- of-age films Category:2000s teen drama films Category:American films Category:American coming-of-age films Category:American independent films Category:American teen drama films Category:Camcorder films Category:Films scored by Keegan DeWitt Category:Films shot in Oregon Category:Independence Day (United States) films Category:Mumblecore films Category:2006 drama films ","title":"Dance Party USA (film)"},{"id":"9507450","text":"2007 World Junior Championships may refer to: * Figure skating: 2007 World Junior Figure Skating Championships * Ice hockey: 2007 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships * Motorcycle speedway: ** 2007 Individual Speedway Junior World Championship ** 2007 Team Speedway Junior World Championship See also * 2007 World Cup (disambiguation) * 2007 Continental Championships (disambiguation) * 2007 World Championships (disambiguation) ","title":"2007 World Junior Championships"},{"id":"9507460","text":"\\"In the Jailhouse Now\\" is an American novelty blues song originally found in vaudeville performances from the early 20th century,The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, p. 131 usually credited to Jimmie Rodgers. The song's first two verses trace the exploits of Ramblin’ Bob, who cheats at cards and gets caught, while the final verse tells about taking a girl named Susie out on the town and winding up in jail together.The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, p. 119  Jimmie Rodgers recording  Rodgers version of \\"In the Jailhouse Now\\" was recorded February 15, 1928, in Camden, New Jersey, and features Rodgers on vocals and guitar, with Ellsworth T. Cozzens playing banjo.Jimmie Rodgers: The Life and Times of America's Blue Yodeler, pp. 137-138 Rodgers included his famous yodel throughout the song. He recorded a sequel titled \\"In the Jailhouse Now—No. 2\\" in Hollywood, California, in 1930, which follows the misadventures of a man named Campbell.Jimmie Rodgers: The Life and Times of America's Blue Yodeler, p. 258  Recording and copyright history  The song has been covered many times, most frequently with Jimmie Rodgers’ version. Artists who have sung it include Tommy Duncan, Webb Pierce, Pink Anderson, Johnny Cash, Jim Jackson, Leon Russell, Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions (featuring Jerry Garcia), Merle Haggard, Doc Watson, Prism, Suzy Bogguss (with Chet Atkins ) Pokey LaFarge, and Tim Blake Nelson with The Soggy Bottom Boys in the film and soundtrack for O Brother, Where Art Thou?. It was also one of the first songs learned by a teenage Joan Baez. The song shows up under different titles including \\"He's in the Jailhouse Now,\\" and some versions use the line \\"She's in the graveyard now\\" in the chorus.The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, p. 141,163 Prior to 1930, several different versions of it were recorded and copyrighted. The earliest is Davis and Stafford's 1915 version, which has verses about a man named Campbell cheating at a card game and a corrupt election.The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, p. 132 In 1924, Whistler's Jug Band from Louisville, Kentucky, recorded it under the title \\"Jail House Blues,\\" which was the same title as a famous blues tune by Bessie Smith but was, in fact, the same song as \\"In the Jailhouse Now\\".The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, p. 135 In 1927, Earl McDonald's Original Louisville Jug Band made another recording of the song.The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, p. 139 Two African- American bluesmen also recorded the song prior to Rodgers: Blind Blake (in 1927), and Jim Jackson (in January 1928). Jackson also copyrighted the song before Rodgers.The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, p. 156 Finally, in 1930, the Memphis Sheiks (a pseudonym for the Memphis Jug Band) recorded it in a version that scholars have often claimed, albeit mistakenly, was a cover of Jimmie Rodgers.The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, p. 149-150 The version of the melody and lyrics that they used, is clearly derived from the Louisville Jug Band performances, not Rodgers. On some of the Memphis Sheiks' records, an African- American vaudeville performer named Bert Murphy is given credit for writing the song.The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, p. 291-292 Shortly after Rodgers recorded the song, three additional versions appeared that were decidedly not covers of Rodgers. Boyd Senter and his Senterpedes did a jazz version in 1929 for Victor Records (issued on #22010, and later reissued on Bluebird Records #5545);Abrams, Steven and Settlemier, Tyrone Online Discographical Project: Victor 22000 - 22500 Retrieved September 14, 2011 Gene Kardos and His Orchestra also did a jazz version in 1932 for Victor; and Billy Mitchell did a stride piano and shouter version of it in 1936 for the Bluebird label.The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, pp. 165-168 After Rodgers, the best-known version of the song was by Webb Pierce, who had a No. 1 country hit with the song in 1955.The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, p. 171 Pierce's version spent No. 1 on the Billboard country chart for 21 weeks, becoming the third song in the chart's history to spend as long on the chart; previously, Eddy Arnold (\\"I'll Hold You in My Heart (Till I Can Hold You in My Arms),\\" 1947) and Hank Snow (\\"I'm Movin' On,\\" 1950) achieved the feat. For 58 years, those three songs held the longevity record for most weeks at No. 1 with 21 weeks, with only a handful of songs coming within a month of matching the record into the early 1960s. Finally, on August 10, 2013, \\"Cruise\\" by Florida Georgia Line surpassed Pierce's \\"In the Jailhouse Now\\" for most weeks at No. 1 when it spent its 22nd week at No. 1. When Johnny Cash recorded the song in 1962, he used a more humorous set of lyrics, based on the 1915 version; after Campbell is locked up, his wife Sadie carries on an affair with the sheriff. Cash learned this version from the African-American jug band musicians in Memphis.The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, pp. 177-180 In spite of this, most writers claim that Cash was covering Jimmie Rodgers' song, which further obscures that the song originated with African-American performers and was kept alive in a vaudeville and jug band tradition for many decades.The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, p. 182 The song regained popularity years later when Sonny James recorded a live version during a 1976 concert at Tennessee State Prison. James' version included backing by the Tennessee State Prison Band, and peaked at No. 15 on the Hot Country Singles chart in 1977. The Jimmie Rodgers version was sung by Gene Autry in his 1941 movie \\"Back in the Saddle.\\" In O Brother, Where Art Thou?, \\"Delmar\\" (Tim Blake Nelson) sings a rendition, with \\"Pete\\" (John Turturro) yodeling between the verses, prior to the Soggy Bottom Boys' main number, \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\". The other \\"Soggy Bottom Boys\\" songs are lip-synched, but Tim Blake Nelson sings his own vocals on this song, while Turturro's yodeling is actually performed by Pat Enright of the Nashville Bluegrass Band. Excerpts available at Google Books. In 1979, the song was done in a blackface performance in the musical One Mo' Time by Vernel Bagneris.The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, p. 187 The musical was revived on Broadway in 2002. The version of the song used in the show was the same as that recorded by the Louisville Jug Bands in the 1920s.The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers, p. 188 Brad Paisley used the chorus for the end of \\"Mr. Policeman,\\" a song on his 2007 album 5th Gear. New lyrics were written to provide an ending to the song's story.

The company was founded by Kelley Dunn-Feliz and Richard Feliz that same year. In its early years, the Festival often faced financial instability, scaled back on its productions and went through several management changes. In 2003, the festival moved to a permanent indoor space within the St Mary's Community Center in the Hampden neighborhood of North Baltimore. The Baltimore Shakespeare Festival closed its doors for good in 2011.

Initially an office for lifetime, assigned by the Sovereign, the High Sheriff became annually appointed from the Provisions of Oxford in 1258. Besides his judicial importance, he had ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. The first (High) Shrivalties were established before the Norman Conquest in 1066 and date back to Saxon times. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the office retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in a county. In Galway the office of High Sheriff was established when Connacht was shired around 1569 and ceased to exist with the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922.

It is part of a large rail precinct, including Munich Laim marshalling yard. It has three platform tracks and is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 3 station. Operations =S-Bahn= S-Bahn lines S 1 to Freising or the Airport and S 2 to Dachau or Petershausen separate from lines S 3, S 4, S 6 and S 8 to Pasing at this station. Platform 1 is used by S-Bahn trains heading out of the city. A few metres from the platform, the track carrying lines S 3, S 4, S 6 and S 8 branches to the right away from the track carrying lines S 1 and S 2 and then crosses over it on a flyover. The nearest stations in this direction are Pasing, Obermenzing and Moosach. It is possible to transfer to regional and long-distance services in Pasing. Platform track 2 is used by S-Bahn trains heading into city on lines S1 and S2. Platform track 3 is used by S-Bahn services heading into city from Pasing. The next stop into the city is Hirschgarten. The S-Bahn running between Pasing and Deisenhofen does not stop at Laim station, but runs south of it on the track to/from Solln. Wotanstraße passes under the station through the Laim underpass, which has a maximum headroom of 3.20 m. Bus routes 51, 151 and 168 pass through the underpass. In the medium to long term, it is proposed that a tram line will be built here. South of the Laim underpass there is a bus stop served by routes 51, 131, 151 and 168. At night this is served by night bus N48. The reconstruction of the whole area has been planned for some time. As part of this, Laim station is to be expanded to four tracks so that there will be a separate track for S-Bahn lines to the north (S1, S2), allowing them to be kept separate from the lines to Pasing (S3, S4, S6, S8) in both directions. It is proposed to build a side tunnel for the bus route and to convert the central tunnel for tram line . As part of the plan for a second S-Bahn trunk line some tracks will be rebuilt at the station. S-Bahn services =Freight= Previously München-Laim marshalling yard (Rangierbahnhof) was along with Munich East marshalling yard one of Munich's two marshalling yards. With the commissioning of the new Munich North marshalling yards, the station's marshalling yard lost its purpose, as wagons were now handling at the new facility. As Deutsche Bahn required additional storage space for Intercity-Express trains, parts of the old rail yard were rebuilt and modernised. The trains enter these storage sidings via a connecting track from the Munich Hauptbahnhof depot. Through freight trains from Pasing, Ingolstadt and Landshut also pass Laim station before they run via Munich South towards Rosenheim and Austria. Interlockings Rail operations in the Laim station precinct are handled from different signal boxes: *The S-Bahn tracks to Donnersbergerbrücke are handled by the electronic interlocking at DB Netz‘s operations centre in Munich. *The modernised tracks of the ICE depot are controlled by the dispatcher in the depot. *The tracks of the former marshalling yard have been controlled since December 2008 by the electronic interlocking at the yard, which is also connected to the Munich operation centre. The track plan interlocking of 1951 and two mechanical interlocking of 1900 (signal box 3) and 1894 (signal box 1) were taken out of service at the same time. Since the commissioning of the Moosburg/Isar electronic interlocking and the related closure of signal boxes in the Langenbach (Oberbayern) station, signal box 2 in Laim yard has been Bavaria's oldest signal box that can be used to control signalling directly.

He played college football at Stanford University from 1940 to 1942, returned as head football coach from 1951 to 1957, and served as the school's athletic director from 1963 to 1971. During his coaching tenure at Stanford, Taylor compiled a 40–29–2 record and led the Indians to the 1952 Rose Bowl his first season. That same season, at the age of 31, Taylor was named AFCA Coach of the Year, the youngest recipient of the award ever. As a sophomore, Taylor was one of the \\"Wow Boys\\" on the undefeated 1940 Stanford Indians football team and played in Stanford's 1941 Rose Bowl victory over Nebraska. As a senior in 1942, he was an All-American guard. Taylor was selected in the fourth round of the 1943 NFL Draft by the Cleveland Rams. By coaching his team to the 1952 Rose Bowl, Taylor became the second person to have participated in the Rose Bowl Game both as a player and a head coach. The first was Wallace Wade who played for Brown in the 1916 bowl game and coached Alabama in 1926,1927 and 1931. Wade also coached Duke University in the Rose Bowl (1939 and 1941). Only six other men have accomplished this feat since Taylor. After leaving coaching in 1957, Taylor returned to Stanford in 1963 as athletic director, where he served until 1971, when Stanford played in the 1971 Rose Bowl, giving him the distinction of being only one of two men who has participated in a Rose Bowl Game as a player, coach, and athletic director. The other man is Jess Hill of USC, who played in the 1930 Rose Bowl, coached in the 1953 and 1955 Rose Bowls, and was athletic director for the 1963, 1967, 1968, 1969, and 1970 Rose Bowls. For many years Taylor and his wife also directed a camp for young people in the coastal range of Northern California near Santa Cruz, called Mountain Camp, where hundreds of young people enjoyed two-week sessions with unlimited recreation and character-building activities.

It belongs to the comarca of A Ulloa. According to the INE, the population was 3,268 inhabitants. History The history of Palas de Rei appears closely linked to military culture, which retains many of the archaeological remains (dolmens and forts) from a remote settlement. According to tradition, the city owes its name \\"Pallatium regis\\" to the palace of the Visigothic king Witiza, who reigned between 702 and 710. In Palas, Witiza would have killed the Duke of Galicia, Favila, father of Don Pelayo. The Romanesque style came through The Way of Santiago, leaving its mark on religious architecture. The church of Vilar de Donas stands out as one of the main references of Galician Romanesque, declared in 1931 historical-artistic monument. Its murals are some of the most outstanding and best preserved in Galicia. The \\"Lucus Augusti\\" route passed through this area, and already in the sixth century was it confirmed as a part of the county of \\"Ulliensis\\", being the Middle Ages a period of prosperity for the town, thanks to the Camino de Santiago. The \\"Codex Calixtino\\" quoted Palas as an obligatory stop for the pilgrims to face the last stretches of the Jacobean route. The town hall of Palas de Rey has an extensive artistic heritage that reflects the noble past of these lands, as it preserves remains of forts, towers, castles, as well as several mansions and emblazoned houses. Among the most important buildings we can mention: the old house-tower of Filgueira; the tower-house of Fontecuberta; the Pazo de Laia that conserves the coat of arms of the counts of Traba, of whose lineage would come the founder of Pambre; the house of Ulloa, where the Saavedra, Montenegros, Gayosos, the Deza, identified with their arms and family shields; the Pazo Mariñao; the old fortress of the Castro de Seixas in the parish of Merlán, from where this well-known Galician lineage comes; the Pazo de Pacheco, and finally the Castle of Pambre, a fortress constructed by Don Gonzalo Ozores de Ulloa in 1375, which resisted the revolt of 1467, becoming one of the best examples of Galic military architecture.

Durini was born in Milan. After studying in Rome and receiving the grade of a doctor, he worked in the papal nunciature in Paris. He was part of the Roman Curia and nuncio in Poland. From 1774 to 1776 Durini lived in Avignon. On 20 May 1776 Pope Pius VI made him Cardinal. As Cardinal Durini was an important patron of the arts, his villa Balbianello on lake Como became a frequent venue for the most exclusive intellectual and social gatherings of the time. On one famous occasion, the Cardinal served the first coffee in Italy, which was called \\"thé nero francese\\" (French black tea). He died in his villa on Lake Como (the Villa Balbianello) in 1796. The villa passed to his nephew, Luigi Porro Lambertenghi.\\"Villa Balbianello, Tremezzina\\" lakecomotravel.com retrieved May 20, 2016 note: article misidentifies Luigi as Angelo's grandson  Villa Balbianello  The villa was built in 1787 on the site of a Franciscan monastery for the Cardinal Angelo Maria Durini. The two towers which can be seen in the picture are the campanili of the convent church. A number of feature films have used the villa for location shooting, including A Month by the Lake (1995), Casino Royale (2006). The villa was also used for the lake retreat scenes in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones (2002) however CGI was used in place of the building's true exterior.

The movie was made to cash in on Selleck's popularity as the character Thomas Magnum in the television show Magnum, P.I., but it failed to return its budget at the box-office on release. The Magnum, P.I. connection is perhaps most clearly seen by the movie poster tagline: The Magnum Man Hits the Big Screen with a Vengeance. Plot Nick Lassiter (Tom Selleck) is a gentleman jewel thief in 1939 London, England. He is arrested by the police after breaking into a London mansion and, after being a member of a phony lineup in which he is positively identified by a law enforcement plant, British law enforcement and the FBI blackmail Lassiter to break into the German Embassy and steal $10 million in Nazi diamonds from a German spy (Lauren Hutton), but first he must locate their hiding place. The gems are en route to South America and will be sold to help finance Hitler's military buildup.

He optioned the script himself, showed it to Golden Harvest while making High Road to China and they bought the option. Selleck signed to make Lassiter before High Road to China came out \\"because I thought it was a good idea to have another film lined up in case High Road didn't work.\\" The film would be directed by Roger Young, who directed the pilot for Magnum, and the filmmakers agreed to work around Selleck's limited schedule - he could only film between April and June. \\"If I'd planned things out maybe I wouldn't have picked two period films in a row,\\" he said. \\"But this was by far the best thing that came along . I hope I fit into it. I like the clothes and the hook.\\" Selleck admitted shortly before filming that he was having second thoughts about making the movie. Advance word on High Road was strong and he was offered a number of other movies. However he stuck to his original promise. Selleck said \\"in a business where you often hear actors described as children its nice to be treated as a partner and as an equal. I was able to have a lot of input into the script, although it didn't need that much.\\" \\"Nick Lassiter is a little rougher around the edges than Magnum,\\" said Selleck. \\"He's a very self assured character. He should be able to walk into a movie with a certain amount of arrogance and gall.\\" Reception Lassiter grossed over $17.5 million at the box office against a $20 million budget, making this a commercial failure. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Lassiter currently holds a 71% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 7 reviews.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lassiter References External links Review New York Times Review *Review Variety Magazine *Review by Roger Ebert Category:English-language films Category:1984 films Category:1980s crime thriller films Category:1980s heist films Category:1980s spy films Category:American films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American heist films Category:American spy films Category:Films set in 1939 Category:Films set in London Category:Films directed by Roger Young Category:Warner Bros. films Category:1984 directorial debut films ","title":"Lassiter (film)"},{"id":"9507784","title":"1987 IBF World Championships"},{"id":"9507800","text":"Unio is a genus of medium-sized freshwater mussels, aquatic bivalve mollusks in the family Unionidae, the river mussels.
