He is considered one of the most ruthless and effective British intelligence officers combating the IRA. Between 1920 and 1922 he served as an intelligence officer in Dublin as part of the British counter-insurgency against republican forces during the Irish War of Independence. He retired from the army to become a successful writer. His nickname, \\"Hoppy\\", stemmed from the loss of a leg in combat during the final months of World War One. Fitted with a prosthesis, he trained himself to disguise the fact, by walking at a very quick pace, almost completely disguising the notion that he had a wooden leg. Early life Jocelyn Lee Hardy was born 10 June 1894 in Kensington, London to Howard and Katherine Hardy. His father was a wool merchant from County Down. Jocelyn Hardy later joined the Connaught Rangers, gaining his commission and joining the 2nd battalion at Aldershot in January 1914. First World War =Capture= Hardy first saw action on 24 August 1914 when his unit served as a rearguard to cover the retirement of the 5th Infantry Brigade in action at Le Grand Fayt, France. By 26 August, Hardy and a group of 19 men led by a Captain Roche found themselves cut off and took shelter in a house being used as a makeshift hospital in the village of Maroilles. During the night, a large force of Germans entered the town, and the next day Hardy's group were discovered and taken prisoner, among 286 men listed as missing in the action. =Prisoner of war= On 21 September 1914, Hardy was promoted to lieutenant whilst a prisoner of war. He made twelve escape attempts from POW camps succeeding in actually escaping on five separate occasions. In early 1915, he attempted to escape from Halle Camp, near Leipzig, by breaking through a brick wall into an adjacent ammunition factory. After five months' work, the project proved impracticable. In the summer of 1915, he was transferred to Augustabad Camp, near Neu Brandenburg, and 10 days later managed to slip away from a bathing party outside the camp, together with a Russian officer. In what was a difficult journey, they covered the to the Baltic coast. They swam a river, were nearly recaptured once, but eventually reached Stralsund. Once there, they nearly managed to get the crew of a Swedish schooner to give them passage, but were arrested at the last moment. Hardy was returned to Halle, and joined an unsuccessful attempt with a group of Russian officers to break down a wall. He then made a solo escape attempt by picking locks and breaking through a skylight before sliding down a rope onto the street. From here he slipped into the rain and darkness. He spoke enough German to make his way by train to Bremen. Here, broken down by cold and hunger, he was recaptured by the Germans. He was then transferred to Magdeburg, where he escaped with a Belgian officer using \\"subterfuge, audacity and good fortune\\". They reached Berlin by train and went on to Stralsund. From there, they crossed to the island of Rugen, but were arrested before they could find a fishing boat to take them to Sweden. His next prisoner of war camp was Fort Zorndorf, from where escape was virtually impossible. Nevertheless, he made several attempts, and one nearly succeeded when, with two others, he almost got out disguised as a German soldier. And on another occasion he managed to break away from his guards while being marched to the kommandatura, and got as far as the train before being recaptured. On 1 January 1917, Hardy was promoted to the rank of captain. He spent another nine months in this camp, before he was transferred to Schweidnitz in Silesia. Within a short period of his arrival, he broke out with Captain Willie Loder-Symonds, Wiltshire Regiment. Carrying forged police passes, they climbed a wire fence, scaled a glass topped wall, and caught a train. They were able to travel across Germany via Dresden, Leipzig, Cologne and Aachen. Then by tram to Richterich, and reached the safety of the Netherlands within 2 days of getting out of Schweidnitz. A fellow prisoner wrote of this escape: > Hardy, had, together with another officer, just escaped over the frontier. > They were in a camp in Silicia, [sic] and had travelled over five hundred > miles through Germany. After escaping, in some civilian clothes, which they > had managed to get into the camp, they walked to a nearby railway station, > and Hardy, having learned to speak German fluently since his captivity, > bought a ticket at the railway station for Berlin. The first part of their > journey was uneventful, but after leaving Berlin, they were asked for their > passports, and Hardy, who had helped us to make the passports at Fort > Zorndorff, and had made for himself and his comrade passports, had an > anxious moment while the official was examining it. But after turning the > passport over several times, the official was satisfied, and gave it back, > and they were safe again for the time being. A little later, however, > Hardy's comrade was taken very ill, no doubt from the effects of his long > imprisonment, and for some time it looked as if the people in the carriage > would notice something wrong, as unfortunately he could not speak any > German. At several other places along the line they had to leave the > carriage, and in some cases had to change trains to get away from one or > other who had become too inquisitive. In the end they arrived at Aachen, > when again their passport was examined, and as before, the officials were > evidently satisfied that it was bona fide, and let them pass. After leaving > the station at Aachen, they boldly walked through the town, and hiding > themselves in a forest near the frontier, they managed to crawl into Holland > during the night. Nobody was more pleased than myself to hear of Hardy's > escape, as he had made many attempts, and certainly deserved to succeed. On 5 March 1918, Hardy boarded at boat at Rotterdam after 3 1/2 years as a prisoner of war. The boat sailed a week later and Hardy returned to England where he was received by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 18 March. Captain Loder-Symonds of the Wiltshire Regiment was killed in a flying accident a short time later as he joined the RFC on his return to England. =Later war service= In April 1918, Hardy transferred to the 2nd Battalion Inniskilling Fusiliers. On 1 August 1918, he was awarded the Military Cross on the Ypres front for leading a fighting patrol which engaged a group of enemy soldiers, killing one and causing the rest to flee. Hardy then used rapid fire to silence one of two German machine guns firing on the patrol before he was wounded by a grenade. Hardy ordered the rest of the patrol to retreat back to their lines whilst he remained to drag his badly wounded sergeant back to safety. The wording for his decoration declared, \\"Throughout the operation he set a splendid example to his men, and also obtained valuable information as to the enemy's dispositions\\". On 2 October 1918, Hardy led a counter-attack near Dadizeele, during which he was shot in the stomach and received such severe wounds to his leg that it had to be amputated. He was evacuated back to England and was still in hospital when the war ended a short time later. He was fitted with an artificial limb and his resulting rapid manner of walking to disguise this earned him the nickname \\"Hoppy\\".Michael Collins Intelligence War by Michael T Foy, page 114 Marriage On 1 November 1919, Hardy married Kathleen Isabel Hutton-Potts in London. On 30 January 1920, Hardy was awarded a bar to his Military Cross, and the Distinguished Service Order \\"in recognition of gallant conduct and determination displayed in escaping or attempting to escape from captivity\\". Irish War of Independence From April 1920, Hardy ceased to be employed by the Military Intelligence Directorate due to \\"ill health caused by wounds\\". He was posted to F Company of the Auxiliary Division, Royal Irish Constabulary (ADRIC), seconded as an intelligence officer based at Dublin Castle, retaining his Connaught Rangers uniform. He later stated that he worked for Scotland Yard, which was the recruiting centre for ADRIC and to whom the information he gathered was relayed for analysis. Despite his wounds, Hardy was to lead raids on various IRA locations, including Vaughn's Hotel in what is now known as Parnell Square. His main role, however, was interrogating prisoners in Dublin Castle who had been captured with weapons or seditious documents of any importance. Hardy had experienced several such interrogations himself as an escaped prisoner of war and he was often aided by his colleague, Captain William Lorraine King, MC. On 10 June 1920, Hardy was awarded a mention in dispatches. Hardy became a hated figure for the IRA, who accused him of brutality in interrogating prisoners, such as tricking suspects into providing information by using a revolver loaded with blanks to stage fake executions or threatening to burn them with a hot poker. The IRA dubbed the cells \\"The Knocking Shop\\".Michael Collins' Intelligence War by Michael Foy In August 2014, TV personality Brendan O'Carroll featured on BBC TV's Who Do You Think You Are investigating the murder of his grandfather, Peter O'Carroll, during the Irish War of Independence. On 16 October 1920, O'Carroll was shot dead at his home in Manor Street, Dublin. The programme uncovered a written testimonial by IRA mole David Neligan in the 1950s stating that IRA spymaster Michael Collins had suspected Hardy was responsible for an almost identical shooting of another Republican, Limerick County Councillor John Lynch in the Exchange Hotel, Dublin. Smith, Patrick. Another 'Mushy' moment?, The Daily Telegraph, 29 August 2014.BBC Television; Who Do You Think You Are?, 28 August 2014 However Neligan had informed Collins that Lynch had actually been killed by Captain G.T. Baggallay after Lynch drew a revolver on him during a raid. Baggallay, who like Hardy had lost a leg in combat, would later be murdered on 'Bloody Sunday'.Michael Collins Intelligence War by Michael Foy p131 The Spy in the Castle by David Neligan London, MacGibbon&Kee; 1968 p105-6 While the BBC programme claimed that Peter O'Carroll was not active in the rebellion, a statement made by Liam O'Carroll (one of Peter's sons and an uncle of Brendan O'Carroll) states that Peter O'Carroll was indeed a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and was involved in arming the rebels.Statement of Liam O'Carroll as provided to the Irish State 1949, bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie. Retrieved 28 August 2016. David Neligan's testimonial is dated 4 May 1950, 30 years after Peter O'Carroll's death. It states that his knowledge that Hardy figured in O'Carroll's murder was based on a description given to members of the Irish Volunteers by O'Carroll family members. However, a newspaper account in the Irish Independent dated 18 October 1920http://theauxiliaries.com/INCIDENTS/o-carroll-murder/press-3.jpg reported that the deceased's daughter Martha said that her mother, on hearing knocking at the door, opened an upstairs window and saw the forms of two or three men at the door. Martha stated that the night was \\"densely\\" dark. It appears from this account that no one else claimed to have seen the murderers and it is unlikely that Mrs O'Carroll could have given a description of any of the men, given that it was very dark at the time and she would have had to have leant out the window to see those at the door. There is no indication that she saw any of the men moving such as would indicate that she might have noticed Hardy's gait. This newspaper account also states that the investigating police took possession of a piece of paper stating \\"A Traitor to Ireland: Shot by I.R.A.\\" which had been pinned to the deceased's back. The only suggested similarity between this murder and Mr Lynch's death is that there was apparently little or no sound from the gun. There is therefore no conclusive evidence that Hardy was involved in the murder of Peter O'Carroll. On one occasion, Hardy was shadowed on a visit to England, but evaded his would-be assassin at Euston station by quickly transferring from his train to a waiting taxi before he could be ambushed. On another occasion, a group of assassins was waiting for him on the dockside on his return to Ireland, but aborted their attempt when an armoured car arrived to pick him up. Hardy was on a list of intelligence agents to be assassinated in the morning hours of 21 November 1920. The IRA's attempt to destroy British intelligence in Ireland resulting in 13 deaths. This would come to be known as \\"Bloody Sunday\\". Hardy escaped death because he was not at his residence when the would-be assassins arrived. The previous evening, Hardy had taken part in a series of raids that led to the capture of prominent republicans Dick McKee and Peadar Clancy, who had done much of the planning around \\"Bloody Sunday\\". Hardy later prevented Clancy from escaping by slipping into a group of prisoners being transferred out of Dublin Castle and both prisoners were later killed in disputed circumstances by the auxiliaries guarding them. Between 13 and 15 February 1921, Captain William L King would be tried by court-martial and cleared of the allegation of the extrajudicial killing of two other IRA members in what would become known as the \\"Drumcondra Affair\\". Dublin Castle's Under Secretary Sir Alfred Cope later speculated that Hardy may have influenced other witnesses in the inquiry. Author In November 1922, Hardy was placed on the army half-pay list. In April 1925, he retired from the army on account of ill-health caused by his wounds. He worked for Lloyds Bank in Pall Mall, London and later went into full-time book writing and farming at Washpit Farm near King's Lynn, Norfolk. His publications were often based on his own true-life adventures and included: * I Escape!, 1927; the true story of Hardy's numerous escapes from German prisoner of war camps during the First World War, with a foreword by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. * Everything is Thunder; the story of an escaped POW aided by a German woman to return to allied lines. * The Key, a play written with Robert Gore-Browne set against the background of Hardy's own experiences with the Auxiliary Division of the RIC during the counter-insurgency in Ireland. * Never in Vain, 1936 * Recoil, 1936; the story of an officer in the Abwehr trying to quell a communist uprising in Africa * The Stroke of Eight, 1938 * Pawn in the Game, 1939 Films Two of his works were made into films. One of these was The Key, dealing with a love triangle between military officers during the Irish conflict. As a play, it opened at the St Martin's Theatre, London on 6 September 1933, and a film version was made in 1934. It would be re-released in the U.S. in 1960 as High Peril. Everything is Thunder (1936) was about an amorous POW officer's romance with a German woman, and her helping him return to allied lines. It received favourable reviews and well- received in Germany at a time when overtures to the Nazis were acceptable in the UK. The film was withdrawn from circulation at the onset of the Second World War. Fascism In the 1930s, Hardy became a supporter of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists (BUF), as did Sir Ormonde Winter, the head of British Intelligence in Dublin Castle, possibly as an agent provocateur. In March 1934, he addressed the King's Lynn BUF, recounting his wartime experiences. In 1937 he embarked on a world trip on the liner SS Rawalpindi with his wife Kathleen Hardy, ostensibly as a holiday but including visits to the strategic Japanese ports of Kobe and Yokohama on the eve of the Second World War. World War 2 During World War 2 Hardy joined the Home Guard and became involved in Auxiliary Units, stay behind groups which would wage guerrilla warfare against the Germans in the event of an invasion of Britain, acting as military liaison for the Narford Auxiliary Unit Patrol.https://www.coleshillhouse.com/narford-auxiliary-unit-patrol.phpThe War Behind The Wire by John Lewis Stempel pages 245–89 As the threat of invasion faded Hardy took command of an anti-aircraft battery, one of 127,000 Home Guardsmen who would combat the Baby Blitz of 1943 and the V1 strikes which followed in the summer of 1944. Later life In addition to his literary accomplishments, Hardy established a reputation as a polo player and a Rolls- Royce enthusiast. He frequently attended Connaught Ranger reunion dinners. He lived in Kensington, London in the 1950s. The Times Obituaries 5 June 1958 Death Hardy died of natural causes on 30 May 1958 in Hammersmith, London. He was buried on 5 June at Wells Church, Norfolk leaving an estate of £57,000, on which £19,000 death duty taxes were paid. In his obituary Hardy is referred to as 'not only a gallant soldier: he was a rare bird, a writer of good and simple prose. A pity he did not write more. But, above all, Hardy was a man'. In the foreword for Hardy's autobiography I Escape!, Conan Doyle pays tribute to Hardy, stating that a \\"more gallant gentleman never lived.\\" References Sources *The Squad, Dwyer, T.

Obbink (born 13 January 1957 in Lincoln, Nebraska) is an American papyrologist and classicist. He is the Lecturer in Papyrology and Greek Literature in the Faculty of Classics at Oxford University, and was the head of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri Project until August 2016. Obbink is also a fellow and tutor in Greek at Christ Church Oxford, from which role he was suspended in October 2019. Early Life and Education Dirk Obbink's ancestors were originally from the Netherlands, later emigrating to the United States. Obbink's father Jack was director of the Federal Housing Administration office in Omaha; his mother worked for the state government. He attended high school in Lincoln, Nebraska, and took a BA in English at the University of Nebraska- Lincoln in 1979, before earning an MA in Classical Studies and Papyrology there in 1984. In 1987, he received his PhD in Classics at Stanford University with his 1986 dissertation entitled Philodemus, De Pietate I. Career After an assistant professorship at Columbia University in New York in 1995, Obbink was appointed to the post of Lecturer in Papyrology and Greek Literature in the Faculty of Classics at Christ Church, Oxford University Classicists at British Universities and was appointed the head of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri Project. The Oxyrhynchus Papyri are a large collection of ancient manuscript fragments discovered by archaeologists at an ancient rubbish dump near Oxyrhynchus in Egypt. They include thousands of Greek and Latin documents, letters and literary works. Oxford University Oxyrhynchus Papyri Project In addition, from 2003 to 2007, Obbink was a faculty member at the University of Michigan, as a professor of classical studies and the Ludwig Koenen Collegiate Professor of Papyrology. From 1998 to circa 2015, Obbink was the Director of the Imaging Papyri Project at Oxford. This project is working to capture digitised images of Greek and Latin papyri held by the Ashmolean Museum (the Oxyrhynchus Papyri), and the Bodleian Library and the Biblioteca Nazionale in Naples (the carbonized scrolls from the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum), for the creation of an Oxford bank of digitised images of papyri. The newly digitised versions of the literary texts will be published. Research Projects at Oxford University - Imaging Papyri Project An international team of papyrologists combine traditional philological methods with more recent digital imaging techniques. They have made accessible heavily damaged texts from the ancient world, many of which had been regarded as being irretrievably lost. In this way the damaged texts of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri and the Villa of the Papyri can now be read for the first time. Obbink has made significant contributions in the fields of ancient literature, society and philosophy. He is familiar with the poetry of Sappho or Simonides discovered in the Egyptian Oxyrhynchus papyri, as he is with the technical-philosophical writings of the Epicurean Philodemus, the text of which he helped recover from the carbonized papyrus rolls discovered in The Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum. In 2001, Obbink was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship for his work on the papyri from Oxyrhynchus and Herculaneum. In May 2007, the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven awarded him an honorary doctorate. Honorary Doctorates awarded by Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (2007) In March 2010, Obbink appeared in Channel 4's series Alexandria: The Greatest City, presented by Bettany Hughes. In the programme he talked about the ancient Library of Alexandria. He also featured briefly in the 2015 BBC documentary Love and Life on Lesbos with Margaret Mountford, in which he showed Mountford a papyrus brought to him by an anonymous private collector in 2012 and that is now believed to be a manuscript copy, executed in about A.D. 200, of a poem written by Sappho in c. 600 B.C. Alleged sale of stolen papyri P.Oxy. 5345 with parts of Mark I 7–9, 16–18 In May 2018, Obbink and Daniela Colomo published the papyrus fragment P.Oxy. 5345 in volume LXXXIII of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri series of the Egypt Exploration Society (EES). This fragment contained portions of six verses from the first chapter of the Gospel of Mark, and was designated \\\\mathfrak{P}137 in the standard classification of New Testament papyri. Obbink and Colomo dated it to the later second or earlier third century, but rumours of its content, provenance and date had been widely discussed since 2012, fuelled by an ill-advised claim by Daniel B. Wallace in 2012 that a fragmentary papyrus of Mark had been authoritatively dated to the late first century by one of the world's leading paleographers, and might consequently be the earliest surviving Christian text. Following publication in 2018, the Egypt Exploration Society, the owners of the papyrus fragment, released a statement clarifying both the provenance of the fragment and Obbink's role in the circumstances of misleading information subsequently emerging on social media. The EES stated that the text in the fragment had only been recognised as being from the Gospel of Mark in 2011. In an earlier cataloguing in the 1980s by Revel Coles, the fragment had been described as 'I/II', which appeared to be the origin of the much discussed assertions of a very early date. In 2011/2012 the papyrus was in the keeping of Obbink, who had shown it to Scott Carroll, then representing the Green Collection, in connection with a proposal that it might be included in the exhibition of biblical papyri Verbum Domini at the Vatican during Lent and Easter 2012. It was not until the spring of 2016 that the EES realised that the rumoured \\"First Century Mark\\" papyrus that had become the subject of so much speculation was one and the same as their own fragment P.Oxy. 5345, whereupon Obbink and Colomo were requested to prepare it for publication. In June 2019, the Egypt Exploration Society released a further statement following the publication by Professor Michael Holmes of the Museum of the Bible of a contract between Obbink and Hobby Lobby dated 17 January 2013 for the sale of a number of fragmentary texts, one of which Holmes identified as P.Oxy. LXXXIII 5345. The Egypt Exploration Society reaffirmed its previous statement that this fragment had never been offered for sale by the EES, while offering the clarification that, in that statement, they had \\"simply reported Professor Obbink's responses to our questions at that time, in which he insisted that he had not sold or offered for sale the Mark fragment to the Green Collection, and that he had not required Professor Wallace to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement in relation to such a sale\\". In the July/August 2019 issue of Christianity Today, Jerry Pattengale wrote an article in which he published for the first time his own perspectives on the 'First Century Mark' saga. Pattengale stated that he had been present with Scott Carroll in Obbink's rooms in Christ Church, Oxford in late 2011, when the \\\\mathfrak{P}137 fragment was offered for sale to the Museum of the Bible, which Pattengale then represented. Also offered for sale were fragments of the Gospels of Matthew, Luke and John, all of which Obbink had then proposed as likely to be of a second century date, while the Mark fragment was presented as more likely first century. According to Pattengale, he had undertaken due diligence in showing images of the four fragments to selected New Testament textual scholars, including Daniel B. Wallace – subject to their signing non- disclosure agreements in accordance with Obbink's stipulations; and the purchase was eventually finalised, with the fragments agreed to remain in Obbink's possession for research prior to publication. It was not until a gala dinner in November 2017, celebrating the opening of the Museum of the Bible, that Pattengale realised that the First Century Mark fragment had been the property of the Egypt Exploration Society all along, and consequently had never legitimately been offered for sale. In October 2019, the Egypt Exploration Society announced that twelve papyrus fragments and one parchment fragment were being returned to them by the Museum of the Bible, which acknowledged that the fragments belonged to the EES. The Museum of the Bible stated that eleven of these pieces had come into their possession after having been sold to Hobby Lobby by Obbink in two batches in 2010. The other two pieces are reported to have been bought from a dealer based in Israel. The EES said that the corresponding catalogue card and photograph for most of these thirteen items were also missing from the EES collection, and that they were only able to identify the missing items because backup copies of the catalogue cards and photographs had been made. The EES is continuing to check its collection for any more items that may have been taken without permission. These thirteen items are: * P.Oxy. inv. 39 5B.119/C(4–7)b: Genesis 5 * P.Oxy. inv. 20 3B.30/F(5–7)b: Genesis 17 * P.Oxy. inv. 102/171(e): Exodus 20–21 * P.Oxy. inv. 105/149(a): Exodus 30.18–19 * P.Oxy. inv. 93/Dec. 23/M.1: Deuteronomy * P.Oxy. inv. 8 1B.188/D(1–3)a: Psalms 9.23–26 * P.Oxy. inv. 16 2B.48/C(a): Sayings of Jesus * related to P.Oxy. inv. 101/72(a): Romans 3 * P.Oxy. inv. 29 4B.46/G(4–6)a: Romans 9–10 * P.Oxy. inv. 106/116(d) + 106/116(c): 1 Corinthians 7–10 * P.Oxy. inv. 105/188(c): Quotation of Hebrews * P.Oxy. inv. 3 1B.78/B(1–3)a: Scriptural homily * P.Oxy. inv. 8 1B.192/G(2)b: Acts of Paul (parchment) Since June 2019, Obbink has had his access to the EES collection removed, and he is under investigation by Oxford University for removing texts belonging to the EES from university premises. In a statement to the Waco Tribune-Herald, Obbink denied all accusations of wrongdoing and claimed that documents linking him to the sale of the papyrus fragments were forgeries deliberately intended to damage his reputation and career. In October 2019, Obbink was suspended from his role at Christ Church, Oxford. In November 2019, the chairman of the Egypt Exploration Society stated that 120 pieces had been discovered to be missing from the EES collection of Oxyrhynchus papyri, including the thirteen items from the Museum of the Bible and another six items now in the collection of Andrew Stimer in California. Both the Museum of the Bible and Stimer have agreed to return the pieces to the EES. The alleged thefts of these items were reported to the Thames Valley Police on 12 November 2019. Obbink's arrest by officers from Thames Valley police was reported on 16 April 2020 in student newspaper The Oxford Blue. Select publications * Alan K. Bowman (Author, Editor), R.A.

Background and succession The succession to the rule of Aidhne after the death of Muirgheas Ua hEidhin in 1180 is unclear. The death of Muirgheas's son, Conor, is reported in 1201 but he is not referred to as king. In 1211 \\"Cugaela Ó hEidhin died\\", again, without context. \\"Donough Ó hEidhin was deprived of sight by the son of Cathal Crovderg, without the consent of the O'Conor\\" in 1212 but again there is no reference to this person ruling the territory. The years 1222–1224 mention dynastic strife with \\" Gilla Mo Choinni Ó Cahill, Lord of Kinelea East and West, was slain by Shaughnessy, the son of Gilla na Naemh Crom Ó Seachnasaigh, after having been betrayed by his own people.\\" In 1223 \\"Seachnasaigh Ó Seachnasaigh, the son of Gilla na Naemh Ó Seachnasaigh, was slain by the Clann-Cuilen, a deed by which the Bachal mor of St. Colman, of Kilmacduagh was profaned.\\" Gilla na Naemh, recorded as Lord of the Western half of Kinelea of Echtge died in 1224. The War of 1225 Ó hEidhin is first mentioned as king of Aidhne during the war of 1225. Aed Meith Ua Neill invaded Connacht to aid Donn Óge Mag Oireachtaigh who had been deprived of his lands by King Aedh Ua Conchobair. The war resulted in Ua Conchobair been usurped by Aedh mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair, who Ó hEidhin supported. While these events were taking place: > the inhabitants of the southern side of Connaught ... were not in a state of > tranquility at this period, for the English of Leinster and Munster, with > Murtough O'Brien, the English of Desmond, and the sheriff of Cork, had made > an irruption upon them, and slew all the people that they caught, and burned > their dwellings and villages. Hugh, the son of Cathal Crovderg, was > displeased at their coming on this expedition; for it was not he that sent > for them, but were themselves excited by envy and rapacity, as soon as they > had heard what good things the Lord Justice and his English followers had > obtained in Connaught at that time. Woeful was the misfortune, which God > permitted to fall upon the best province in Ireland at that time! for the > young warriors did not spare each other, but preyed and plundered each other > to the utmost of their power. Women and children, the feeble, and the lowly > poor, perished by cold and famine in this war! Donough Cairbreach Ó Briain sent some of his people, together with the spoils of battle, ahead of him back to Thomond. However, Aedh mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair and Owen Ó hEidhin were alerted to this, and \\"went before them with a few select men, defeated the Momonians, deprived them of their spoils, and detained some of their nobles as hostages.\\" Aedh Ua Conchobair was restored but soon after his English supporters left the kingdom, Áedh Mór Ó Flaithbheartaigh with \\"all the other nobles, revolted against him, and joined the sons of Roderic.\\" King Aed obtained aid from the English of Leinster \\"under the conduct of William Grace and the sons of Griffin.\\" Aedh sent his brother Felim Ua Conchobair with a mixed force of Irish and English \\"into Hy- Fiachrach Aidhne, to plunder Owen O'Heyne. These encamped for one night at Ardrahen, with a view to plunder the country early in the morning following.\\" Ó Flaithbheartaigh and the Ó Conchobair's were en route to join Aedh mac Ruaidri when they received intelligence that > \\"the English had gone to plunder their sworn partisan, Owen O'Heyne, and > were stationed at Ardrahan, did not abandon their friend, but, with one mind > and accord, followed the English until they came very close to them. They > then held a council, and came to the resolution of sending Tuathal, the son > of Murtough O'Conor, and Taichleach O'Dowda, with numerous forces, into the > town, while O'Flaherty and the other son of Murtough were to remain with > their forces outside Tuathal and Taichleach, with a strong body of their > soldiers, marched spiritedly and boldly into the town, and made a powerful > attack upon the English there, who were routed east and west. They pursued > those who fled eastwards. Tuathal wounded the constable of the English with > his first shot; and Taichleach, by another shot, gave him so deep a wound, > that he was left lifeless. As to the English who were routed westwards from > the town, they were met by O'Flaherty and the other son of Murtough; but it > happened, through their evil destiny, that the English routed them > immediately. On this occasion Mahon, the son of Hugh, who was son of Conor > Moinmoy; Gilchreest Mac Dermot; Niall, the son of Farrell O'Teige (Fearghal > Ó Taidg an Teaghlaigh), and others, were slain; but the man who slew Niall > O'Teige, i.e. the brother of Colen O'Dempsey, was slain himself also.\\" 1232 A Gilla Ceallaigh Ó hEidhin was killed in battle in the Tuathas fighting alongside Connor mac Aedh mac Ruaidhri, but his relationship to Owen is unclear. It was in 1232 that \\"The kingdom of Connaught was again given to Hugh, the son of Roderic\\", Owen's lord, and that de Burgh began building the castle of Galway. 1235 A major expedition was led into Connacht by Richard Mór de Burgh. At Ardcarne, \\"the English held a private consultation, at the request of Owen O'Heyne, who wished to be revenged on the Momonians, and on Donough Cairbreach O'Brien.\\" They determined to travel through Uí Maine and Máenmaige to enter Thomond in secrecy, where they \\"committed great depredations.\\" The English forces were shadowed by King Felim Ua Conchobair, who, with the men of Munster, > came to a pitched battle with the English, and fought manfully. But the > English cavalry and infantry, who were clad in armour, finally overcame > them. Many were slain on both sides, but the Momonians suffered most loss, > through the imprudence of Donough Cairbreach. The Connacians then returned > home, and on the next day O'Brien made peace with the English, and gave them > hostages. Returning to Connacht, Owen and the English, now joined by Áedh Mór Ó Flaithbheartaigh, found the kingdom desolate as Fedlim had ordered all its peoples to take themselves and their livestock out of their route. The English invaded Achill, while Ó Flaithbheartaigh and Ó hEidhin \\"also came round with a great army, having vessels with them, which they carried by land as far as Linan Cinn-mara. These vessels, with their forces, being met by the Lord Justice at Druimni, were brought to the Callow of Inis-Aenaigh.\\" The joint armies plundered Achill and its surrounding islands, killing all they found upon it. The land around Clew Bay, belonging to the Ó Máille clan, was extensively plundered \\"both by sea and land\\". The expedition then raided Domnall Mór Ó Domhnaill in Tír Chonaill and proceeded to raid on their way to Loch Cé. Here the English returned to Mide and the Irish to south and west Connacht. 1236 > The Lord Justice of Ireland, Mac Maurice, summoned the English of Ireland to > meet him at Ath-feorainne, at which meeting Felim, the son of Cathal > Crovderg O'Conor, was present. They all yearned to act treacherously towards > Felim, although he was the gossip of the Lord Justice; and this was the > reason that the meeting had been called. Felim having received intelligence > and forewarning of their design, departed from the assembly; and, attended > by a few horsemen, proceeded to Roscommon. He was pursued thither and as far > as the bridge of Sligo; he fled to O'Donnell for protection. As they did not > overtake him they committed great acts of plunder upon Teige O'Conor, and > carried away many respectable women into captivity and bondage; they then > proceeded to Druim Gregruighe in Moylurg, where the Lord Justice awaited > their return.

First instituted in 1951, the medal is presented for twenty aggregate years of service in the police services of the United Kingdom. Criteria The Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal was instituted under Royal Warrant by King George VI in June 1951 and is awarded as a mark of the Sovereign's appreciation of long and meritorious service rendered by members of the Police Forces of the United Kingdom. For an officer to become eligible for this award the Chief Constable must make a recommendation to the Home Secretary, and in doing so, is required to certify the following: #That an officer has been a serving member of a Police Force. #That the officer has served efficiently for the qualifying period. #That the officer's character has been very good. =Commonwealth= In 1956 eligibility was extended to police officers serving in Australia, Papua New Guinea and Nauru. In 1976 Australia replaced the award with the National Medal and, in 2010, with the National Police Service Medal.National Police Service Medal, It's an Honour – Australian Government Website =Length of service= The initial award criteria was 22 years' service as a full-time regular police officer within any Constabulary. Later, Long Service and Good Conduct Medals were introduced for the Fire Brigade and Ambulance Service, both awarded for 20 years’ service. A national campaign to award the police medal after 20 years, and so bring it in line with the other emergency services, was started by Warwickshire Police Officer Kenneth Fowler, supported by Chief Officers, the Police Federations and Members of Parliament. On 19 January 2010, Queen Elizabeth II amended the medal's royal warrant to make the qualifying period of service 20 years. Appearance The medal is circular, in diameter and initially issued in cupro-nickel, with modern strikings being rhodium plated. It has the following design: * The obverse bears the effigy of the reigning monarch * The reverse has the figure of Justice with scales in her left hand and a wreath in her right surrounded by the inscription 'FOR EXEMPLARY POLICE SERVICE'. * The suspender is straight and found in both swivelling and non- swivelling formats. * It is named on the rim in impressed capital letters. In general, the recipient’s rank is only shown for sergeants and above. * It hangs from a dark blue ribbon, wide, with two thin white stripes towards each edge. * No bars are authorised for this medal. = Obverse variations = The medal has been awarded with one of three obverse designs: File:NGSM 1915 GVI obv 1949-52.jpgGeorge VI (1951–53) File:Naval General Service Medal 1915 (Obverse) First Elizabeth version.jpgElizabeth II 'BR OMN' (1953 to mid-1950s) File:NGSM 1915 EBII obv.jpgElizabeth II 'DEI GRATIA' (From mid-1950s) See also *Queen's Police Medal *Special Constabulary Long Service Medal References Category:Law enforcement in the United Kingdom Category:Civil awards and decorations of the United Kingdom Category:Law enforcement awards and honors Category:Awards established in 1951 ","title":"Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal"},{"id":"26696688","text":"Gymnasium Karlovac (), sometimes historically referred to as Higher Real Gymnasium, is a secondary school (gymnasium) located in the city of Karlovac in Croatia.

One charter school founded with its board chair as Randi Weingarten, who also then headed the United Federation of Teachers, a teachers' union, proposed collaboration between teachers and management and a normal-length school day. New York City public schools then-chancellor Joel Klein was \\"thrilled\\"Brill, Steven, Class Warfare, op. cit., p. 133. for the school's founding, according to journalist Steven Brill, partly because once that school needed space in a public non charter school the union could not object to the principle of collocation and he could arrange for other charters to share space with non charters.Brill, Steven, Class Warfare, op. cit., pp. 133–134. Its first charter was approved in 2005. The renewal in 2010 was proposed to be limited to 3 years instead of the normal 5, because the school had \\"an ambiguous or mixed record of educational achievement\\", with only 34 percent of students being proficient in math when tested and 28 percent of students doing so in English.  Influence on non charters  Studies of the impact of charters on public schools have produced mixed results. A 2017 study from Temple University showed the positive effects NYC charter schools have made on neighboring district schools. The analysis, based on data from the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE), found that \\"charter schools have small positive spillovers on public school students, increasing math and ELA performance.\\" The study also found that charter schools have no significant negative effect on their neighboring district school. But most studies find that charter schools have not achieved their original mission of creating innovative educational practices that can be brought back to public schools. Further, charter schools have placed significant strain on public school resources: \\"Despite expenditure cutting measures, districts simultaneously facing rapid student population decline and/or operating in states with particularly inequitable, under-resourced school finance systems have faced substantial annual deficits.\\"  Charter Schools Record of Educational Results  By certain measures, charter schools in New York City outperform their district school counterparts on an annual basis. These measures emphasize the numbers of students proficient at a given grade level. However, they don't account for the fact that students in charter schools are self-selecting. And although charters purportedly admit students by lottery, multiple reports indicate that charter schools employ methods that exclude students who have a lower likelihood of grade-level proficiency. As a result, the profiles of students entering charter schools vary significantly from those entering charter schools. Such selective admission practices make it difficult to compare proficiency levels across public and charter schools. In the 2017 annual New York State assessments: 53% of New York City charter school students were proficient in English Language Arts (ELA), compared with 38% of NYC district students. In math, 48% of charter students were proficient; 41% of district students were proficient. Among African-Americans: 52% of charter students could do math at grade level, only 20% of district students were proficient. For ELA: 49% of African-American charter students were proficient; 29% of district students were proficient. Among Hispanic students: 48% of charter students were proficient in math; 25% of Hispanic district school students were proficient in math. And in ELA: 45% of Hispanic charter school students could read at grade level; while 30% of Hispanic district students were proficient. Analysis from The Future of Children, a journal published by Princeton University and the Brookings Institution, found that \\"On average, charter schools perform at about the same level as traditional public schools.\\" However, the report also found that charter schools employing a \\"no excuses\\" approach are more effective at closing the achievement gap than those that don't. An analysis by The Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) at Stanford University showed \\"the benefits for charter students are as if the students received 34 days of additional learning in reading and 63 additional days in math in the course of a school year.\\" Other studies have found that, when controlling for incoming populations, charter schools lag behind public schools in student performance. \\"A well-publicized study of charter schools by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) in 15 states and the District of Columbia studied 70% of the students enrolled in charter schools in the U.S. They found 17 percent of charters posted academic gains that were significantly better than traditional public schools, 37 percent of charter schools were significantly worse, and 46 percent were statistically indistinguishable. Another recent study by Zimmer et al. found that charters in five jurisdictions were performing the same as traditional public schools, while charter schools in two other jurisdictions were performing worse.\\" = Emulation and choice through competition = Former New York City School Chancellor Joel I. Klein argued that charters don't substitute for public non charters but do demonstrate improvements that non charters might emulate and, by letting parents choose schools, break the non charter monopoly. = Draining of resources from public schools = Arguments include that innovations in the charter schools should be provided in the non charter public schools, smaller class sizes require more financing and public non charters need that finance, and benefits should be provided to the many students in non charter public schools rather than to just the few attending charters, especially since students who are rejected by charters must be accepted by the public schools, so more support should go to public non charter schools.Charter Schools and the Opposition, by Maryam Abdul-Aleem, in N.Y. Amsterdam News (possibly vol. 100 & no. 41), October 8–14, 2009, p. 32, [§] Education Today. However, charter schools receive less per-pupil funding from the State government than do public non charter schools,Brill, Steven, Class Warfare, op. cit., pp. 145 & 167. one legislative leader saying that charter schools have been claiming that being nonunion allows cost- saving.Brill, Steven, Class Warfare, op. cit., p. 167. = Management being for profit = In New York State, all charter schools are non-profit educational institutions with distinct Boards of Trustees (501c3). Board members must remain independent of any for-profit entity connected with the school, according to both state and federal law. However, in some cases, those boards may contract with a management company. This became controversial when those management companies were for-profit. As for 2010, NYS law no longer allows for-profit management companies to contract with charter schools, leaving only 6 schools contracted with for-profit management under the previous law. Whether charter schools should be either run by for-profit businesses or supported with for-profit management support organizations has been challenged.Senate Panel Hears Debate Over Charters, by Marcy L. Velte, in The (Albany, N.Y.) Legislative Gazette, April 26, 2010, as accessed May 21, 2010. One side argues that money is going to pay profit (rather than to educate children) and therefore that for-profit managements should be banned. The other side argues that a for-profit management firm is assisting a school in producing academic results,How For-Profits Help Charters, by Kay Madati & Omar Wasow, in N.Y. Post (opinion op-ed column), May 20, 2010, as accessed May 22, 2010. the school can focus on academics and accountability, the firm can raise major funds, just 2% of the nearly 300 charter schools in New York State are run for profit,. = Competition for space in public noncharter schools = There has been criticism that charter schools are often given space in public noncharter schools,Eva Moskowitz Has Special Access to Schools Chancellor Klein – and Support Others Can Only Dream of, by Juan Gonzalez, in N.Y.

A counterargument is that, at least in New York City, the schools losing space are generally not educating well and the space is going to charter schools that generally do better at educating students. A counterargument to that is that the two sets of schools are not educating the same students, leaving students in the noncharter schools with fewer resources for their needs. A counterargument to that is that noncharter students generally may apply to other schools to get access to better education.N.Y. state statutes online (click \\"EDN\\", then \\"Article 65\\", then \\"Part 1\\", then § \\"3204\\"), as accessed April 7, 2010 (see subdivision 1, 1st sentence) (this source is provided by the state but may not be usable in court as prima facie evidence of the laws).

Amsterdam News (possibly vol. 97 & no. 14), March 30–April 5, 2006, p. 3. Another counterargument (to the argument that collocation constrains noncharters' space) is that the cost of renovating existing school space is far lower than the cost of renting, buying, or building fresh real estate.Brill, Steven, Class Warfare, op. cit., p. 145 (\\"the cost of that was nothing compared to ....\\").

As a consequence, charter schools may not find space in those schools to move into at this time. The court was the New York State Supreme Court, specifically the court for New York County, i.e., Manhattan; the decision was by Justice Joan B. Lobis. The order not to close the schools was granted by the court because the City had not complied with the recently-amended state law on Mayoral control of the public schools, requiring \\"meaningful community involvement\\" in the decision to close a school. \\"The judge wrote that the [educational] impact statement for [\\"Paul\\"] Robeson [\\"High School in Brooklyn\\"], for example, did not say where young mothers . . . could find similar programs [in the city] [\\"like one devised for mothers and pregnant teenagers . . . that offers day care and teaches parenting skills\\"].\\"Judge Blocks Closing of 19 New York City Schools, by Sharon Otterman (with Nate Schweber), in N.Y. Times, op. cit., with bracketed quotation \\"educational\\" and bracketed \\"in the city\\" both from Mulgrew v. Board of Education, decision & opinion, in N.Y. Law Journal, op. cit. A 20th school, a vocational high school, was slated for closing but the City had opted not to close it because of community feedback favoring preserving its automotive program; the court cited that as an example of what might result from proper procedure for community involvement. While the impact statements were provided online, respondents didn't deny that they were not distributed to parents and others as \\"hard copies . . . . Although some parents [and others] . . . may have computer and internet access, certainly not all do.\\" Impact statements were often boilerplate in disclosing information about numbers of seats but not about specialized programs, some participants in the process were scripted when they should instead have been \\"part of the process of structuring those meetings\\", and question-and-answer sessions were not allowed at all the meetings where they should have been. The ruling did not mean, in general, that failing schools couldn't be closed or that these 19 schools were not failing, but that the process applied for deciding on these closures at this time had not been complied with, and that compliance must be \\"strict\\".

Life and career Originally from Barcelona, Salvador worked at the Schneider Art Glass factory in France. In 1915 he moved to Scotland with his family where he was recruited to teach light bulb glassblowing at Leith Flint Glassworks in Edinburgh. In 1922 he moved to the Moncrieff glassworks in Perth, initially to make laboratory glassware with his eldest son Paul (1904–1991). Producing ‘friggers’ (hobby pieces) in their spare time, they were encouraged to produce art pieces and by 1924 had produced a range of decorative glasswares under the name of Monart (from MONcrieff and YsART). By the 1930s, their pattern book contained a range of glasswares including vases, bowls, lampshades, candlesticks, scent bottles, ashtrays and paperweights and retailed at leading stores such as Liberty & Co. and Tiffany & Co.. Production of art glass at Moncrieff’s ceased during World War II. After the war, Moncrieff’s were reluctant to continue producing art glass, so in 1947, Salvador, with his younger sons Vincent and Augustine, set up Vasart Glass. Paul Ysart continued to work at Moncrieff’s, producing a limited range of Monart glass and paperweights till 1961, when art glass production finally ceased. By the 1950s, Vasart was proving to be popular, but in 1955 Salvador died, followed a year later by Augustine. This left Vincent running the business on his own. Production declined through the late 1950s and in 1964, Vasart was taken over by Teachers Whisky (for whom they were making squashed whisky bottle ashtrays) and was rebranded as Strathearn Glass. Monart and Vasart Monart and Vasart glass objects, such as paperweights, vases and dishes, are characterised by vibrant marbled colours combined with subtle hues and inclusions of mica flecks and bubbles. Their decorative and distinctive style has made such objects popular with collectors, many examples of which can be seen at the Perth Museum .

Siva and Sona Heiden. It stars Jai, Shazahn Padamsee, and Vijay Vasanth in the lead roles. The film features music composed by Satish Chakravarthy, cinematography by Chidamparam and editing done by duo Praveen K. L. and N. B. Srikanth. Kanimozhi was launched in March 2010 and shot in 46 days, being completed in August 2010. Following the release of Enthiran and post-production works, the film was delayed by three months and released on 26 November 2010. It was panned by critics and became a failure at the box office. However, in 2012 the film was dubbed in Telugu as Love Journey. Plot The film is based on the philosophy that dreams will be fulfilled, presenting Rajesh (Jai) as having a fetish for writing a diary, while changing things that go wrong in his life to have a happy ending. He comes across a pretty girl named Anu (Shazahn Padamsee), who he is intimidated by and cannot build up the courage to tell her his feelings. Meanwhile, Gowshik (Vijay Vasanth) also takes a liking to Anu and uses a different method to convey his feelings. Whom Anu falls for forms the crux of the story. Cast * Jai as Rajesh * Shazahn Padamsee as Anu * Vijay Vasanth as Gowshik * Michael Thangadurai as Michael * Lakshmi Ramakrishnan * Ranga as Hari * Ashwin Raja as Deepak * Ajay as Dilip * Swati Reddy in a guest appearance Production =Development= After the success of T. Siva's production, Saroja, the director, Venkat Prabhu, recommended his assistant Sripathy Rangasamy to Siva for a potential collaboration. Venkat Prabhu also recommended Sona Heiden as a joint producer. Sripathy had written the story of Kanimozhi in college and built the screenplay around a story based on philosophy. Siva suggested the title, Kanimozhi, in hope to build anticipation and believed that titling the film after a prominent female politician in M. K. Kanimozhi would help publicity. After approaching her, she stated she had no objection with the title and praised the storyline. Subsequently, posters emerged around Chennai without any credits attached, only featuring the bold lettering of the film's name to create hype. After working in two films where Sripathy had been an assistant director, Jai was signed to play the leading role of Rajesh. The director suggested that he had wanted an actor who \\"looked 21\\" and Jai was \\"the best bet\\". Swati Reddy, who featured opposite Jai in the 2008 blockbuster, Subramaniyapuram, was initially considered for the leading female role but was then dropped. Swati later appeared in a guest appearance during the climax. Shazahn Padamsee, who had appeared opposite Ranbir Kapoor in Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year, subsequently signed on and made her début in Tamil films. Shazahn was approached after Sripathy was sent images of her portfolio by a model-coordinator from Mumbai. She agreed to do the film after consent from her father, noted theatre personality, Alyque Padamsee. Vijay Vasanth was signed on to play a significant role, while Ranga and Michael Thangadurai were selected to play Jai's friends. Sakthi Saravanan's associate P. Chidamparam was selected to make his début as cinematographer with Kanimozhi. Satish Chakravarthy was signed for the project ten minutes into a meeting with the makers of the film. Notably, T. Siva's maiden production featured music composed by Satish Chakravarthy's father. Venkat Prabhu's editing team of Praveen K. L. and N. B. Srikanth was retained for the project. =Filming= The film was launched in a ceremony in Chennai on 25 March 2010 organised by the producers. The event was attended by prominent directors including Bala, K. S. Ravikumar and Venkat Prabhu, and several cast members from Jai's previous film, Chennai 600028. Satish Chakravarthy performed songs from the film at the event, while noted actor Nassar compered. Following the launch, the film started the first schedule in April and completed the shoot within 46 days, shorter than the average Tamil film takes. Furthermore, unlike other most other Indian films, Kanimozhi was shot with live sound, while a special silent camera was also used. The sound was mixed at Yashraj Studios in Mumbai and audiographed by Anandar Chandrahasan. The cast had spoken their lines on the set, with only Shazahn Padamsee's voice being dubbed. The song \\"Muzhumadhi\\" was dubbed as the \\"underwater song\\" and was completed entirely through the use of graphics, while final mixing for many scenes were record at the Sterling Sound studio, USA. In April 2010, Jai celebrated his 25th birthday while at the filming location in Chennai, with the team throwing a party for him. In June, the work progressed with Shazahn and Jai filming scenes at the AVM Studios in Vadapalani, Chennai. The song recorded at the studio ended the filming portions of the project, which was wrapped up on 18 June 2010. Despite being a love story, the lead pair had only shot together for two weeks, although they have since stated that they bonded during the filming, helping the on-screen chemistry of the characters. Post production works began in July 2010, preparing for a release in August. However, the film was delayed and works finished in September 2010. A final press meet, two weeks before release, was held on 13 November 2010 with most of the cast in attendance. The producers released the video songs five days before the film released to gain publicity, with Kalaignar TV winning the screening rights; they also acquired the Behindwoods.com homepage for adverts during the time of release. Release =Reception= The producers held a premiere for Kanimozhi on 25 November 2010 at Sathyam Cinemas, Chennai for special invitees including Silambarasan, Prasanna and most of Jai's co-stars from his previous films. Shazahn Padamsee, whose Telugu film Orange released on the same day, was unable to make the premiere after suffering from malaria. The film was released throughout Tamil Nadu the following day, having a bigger release in multiplexes across Chennai than Myshkin's Nandhalala, which was released on the same day. Kanimozhi took an average opening at the Chennai box office, beginning in third position and completing 116 shows over the weekend, grossing 14 lakh rupees. =Reviews= Upon release, the film received mixed reviews from critics, mostly criticising the screen writing from the director. The review from Sify.com labelled the film as \\"OK\\" and that for \\"the intentions alone, the makers of Kanimozhi deserve a thumbs-up\\". Jai's role was appreciated and described as \\"endearingly likeable\\", while Shazahn Padamsee \\"looked pretty and was photographed well\\" but \\"could have invested more energy and expression to her character\\". The review goes on to claim that Swati's scene in the climax \\"scores\\", and that music by Sathish Chakravarthy \\"are just about ok but come as speed breakers\\". The critic cites that \\"most scenes lack the energy that was required to elevate this film into a different level\\" and the final result is a \\"promising but sadly tiresome film\\" but that it will make you \\"leave the theatre with a smile on your face\\". The review site Top10cinema, branded the film as \\"average\\" claiming it \\"could have been much better\\". Sripathy is praised, citing that \\"the debutant filmmaker’s portrayal of characters is appealing\\" but that \\"the film fails to offer grippingness at several points\\". The performances from the actors received a mixed response with Jai dubbed as \\"too raw and naturalistic\\" and Shazahn Padamsee being likened to a \\"Barbie Doll without reaction\\". However, Vijay Vasanth's acting was described as \\"appeasing\\" and Swati's cameo in the climax was praised in the review. It received a similar review from Rediff.com, praising the film's intentions but criticizing the final product. The Hindu newspaper gave it a more critical review, with a verdict that the film is \\"a real test of your patience\\" but revealed it was a \\"genuine attempt at creating realistic cinema that also entertains\\", praising the story and the screenplay. The review, however, concludes the script was limited, and the actors' performances were therefore limited. The review from Behindwoods.com was much less favourable, giving the film 1 star out of 5, citing that is \\"disappointing\\" and that it fails to live up to expectations. It cites that for Jai \\"it is just another film in his career\\" as per for Vijay Vasanth, while Shazahn Padamsee's performance is particularly criticised with a claim that she \\"does not seem to know the spelling of emotion in any scene\\". In regard to technical aspects, it claims that the music by Satish Chakravarthy is \\"good\\" but the cinematography \\"appears bleached throughout\\". The direction also gains criticism for a \\"screenplay fails to engage the viewer and is ineffective\\", describing the film \\"as a soul-less affair\\". =Controversy= In January 2012, it was announced that the film was being dubbed in Telugu by producer Jakkula Nageshwara Rao as Preminchava Nannu. However, this led to Sona Heiden alleging that producer T. Siva had committed acts of fraud and forgery by trying to dub and sell the rights of Kanimozhi to others and thus requested the Tamil Nadu Film Producers' Council to take action. She claimed that she entered into an agreement with T. Siva, proprietor of Amma Creations, on 28 January 2010, for purchasing the entire rights to Kanimozhi and thus secured 50% for any subsequent dubbed versions. Heiden said that Siva had entered into an agreement with third parties for dubbing the film in Telugu, alleging that he forged her signature and sold the rights. Production work continued and the Telugu version's producer held the logo launch of the film during a Celebrity Cricket League match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium with actresses Bhavana, Charmy Kaur, Sonia Agarwal, Madhu Shalini and Archana being the chief guests. It was retitled as Love Journey to capitalize on the success of Jai's previous Telugu dubbed film Journey. The audio was released after a function held at another CCL match in Visakhapatnam with CCL director Srinivasa Murthy and Srikanth being prominent guests. The Telugu version geared up for release in March 2012, but the Madras High Court issued a stay order against the release of the film's Telugu version as per Heiden's complaint.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack to Kanimozhi was composed by Satish Chakravarthy, for whom it became his first theatrical release, as his previous album Leelai was delayed. The soundtrack album features four songs and an additional musical version of another song. The lyrics are penned by Na. Muthukumar and Pa. Vijay while the audio rights were bought by Think Music. The songs were appreciated from critics with a review citing \\"the music is tidy and uncluttered\\" and Sathish Chakravarthy's \\"creativity comes to the fore in a couple of songs\\", concluding that the \\"album certainly does not disappoint\\". The audio was released in a large function on 22 July 2010 at Kalaignar Arangam, with the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, M. Karunanidhi and noted actor Vijay being the chief guests and receiving the first copy of the soundtrack. An animated trailer, the first of its kind in Indian cinema, featuring lead actors Jai and Shazahn Padamsee was screened with three songs from the film. Closer to the release in mid October, a theatrical trailer was released. The Telugu version of the audio was released at a Celebrity Cricket League match in Visakhapatnam. All the songs from the original version were retained with different singers for the Telugu version, while lyrics were written by Vennelakanti and Bhuvanachandra.

Radio and accessibility By 1940, 80% of American households would own a radio; making American music far more accessible to civilians and soldiers alike. Although the radio could be used to boost American morale, the American Government censored radio channels in fear that enemy agents may be sending coded messages through song requests on the stations. Popular songs Unlike many World War I songs, many World War II songs focused more on romance and strength instead of propaganda, morale, and patriotism. Songs that were overly patriotic or militaristic were often rejected by the public. During World War II, American music helped to inspire servicemen, people working in the war industries, homemakers and schoolchildren alike. Popular singers of the era included Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, the Andrews Sisters and Bing Crosby. Notable wartime radio songs were Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy, Shoo Shoo Baby, I'm Making Believe, I'll Be Seeing You, and I'll Be Home for Christmas. Songs that ridiculed the Axis Powers were also popular. These songs include We'll Knock the Japs Right into the Laps of the Nazis, Yankee Doodle Ain't Doodlin' Now, You're a Sap, Mr. Jap, and Oliver Wallace's song Der Fuehrer's Face, popularly recorded by Spike Jones, itself inspiring a 1943 Walt Disney cartoon starring the fictional character Donald Duck. A notable trend with songs that targeted the Axis powers was that for the songs directed towards Europe, the songs focused on Hitler and the Nazis as opposed to the civilians. On the other hand, songs that were directed towards the Pacific showed blatant racism, hate, anger, and revenge following the Pearl Harbor attack. Swing music Swing music was a notable example of wartime radio music. Even Nazi Germany fielded some swing music bands despite Hitler's objections to \\"decadent Western music.The Dance Band Era. Albert McCarthy. Chilton Book Company. 1971. page 140. \\" After the end of World War II, this music escalated until the paranoia of the Cold War made this kind of music irrelevant after the Soviet menace (under Joseph Stalin) replaced the Nazi menace (under Adolf Hitler). Lawrence Welk would later play this kind of music on The Lawrence Welk Show. Jazz music would also become part of the \\"cultural war\\" that raged alongside the actual fighting of World War II. Having its roots in African-American music, the Nazi regime had declared it to be \\"inhuman music\\" and banned it in all of occupied Europe. The local musicians of Paris, France chose to play jazz music in French rather than in English as a loophole in the Nazi jazz music ban. Rebellious German kids would meet in secret locations and listen to Allied music stations to hear jazz music behind the Gestapo's metaphorical back. This generation of German kids saw jazz music as a \\"religion worth fighting for.\\" References Further reading * Bell, David H. ; Carnelia, Craig ; Terkel, Studs.

The reserve is dedicated to teaching youth about nature through hands on experiences and preservation. It is the largest undisturbed wooded area in Black Hawk County, Iowa and is home to three distinct habitats including wetland, forest, and prairie. History Hartman Reserve was named Camp Hartman when it was owned and operated by the YMCA and was only in size. Hartman Reserve was named after John C. Hartman who was the editor for the Waterloo Daily Courier. Hartman was a nature enthusiast and amateur archaeologist. When the YMCA could not raise the money to buy the property, Hartman donated a sizable amount towards the purchase, enough to have the property bear his name. The reserve was purchased in 1938 as a camping site for local boys and as a site for use by members of the local YMCA. The camp had a pool, a lodge, cabins and other facilities for overnight and day campers. For various reasons the YMCA decided to sell the camp in 1976. The Black Hawk County Conservation Board purchased 69 acres of the reserve from the YMCA. Eleven acres of Hartman Reserve's lowlands was briefly considered for the US 218 highway, but public opinion helped to push the route north of George Wyth Memorial State Park. The cities of Cedar Falls and Waterloo could not afford to purchase the reserve from the YMCA, so city officials and others encouraged the Black Hawk County Conservation Board to purchase the land in 1976.History Additions were later made to the reserve in the lowlands area north of the former railway, now a bike path. This area included two lakes created through sand mining operations and land up to the Cedar River. Coy, M, Frana, M, & Grier, J. (2010). History and current status. Unpublished manuscript, Department of Natural Science, University of Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls, Iowa. Hartman Reserve Nature Center is part of Black Hawk County Conservation. In 2005, Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack signed the Articles of Dedication and designated part of the reserve as the Hartman Bluff State Preserve. Fauna =Plants= The Hartman Reserve forest is a mature forest that has many different species of trees that are over 100 years old. There are over 138 different species of plants. Some of the trees would include White Oak, Red Oak, Bur Oak, Hackberry, Walnut, and Sugar Maple. The hackberry, walnut, and sugar maple thrive in the reserve due to the flood plain. Every spring the Cedar River floods into the reserve creating super saturated soils and marsh-like conditions. To control the growth of trees and other vegetation, Hartman Reserve practices controlled burning. They started burning selected parts of the forest in 1999. buck in the Center's prairie regionalt=A buck in the middle of a prairie. The current forest is a combination of two earlier forests; xeric and mesic. This is because the Hartman forest is located on part of a bluff and part of a flood plain. The reserve is also home to a natural prairie. The natural prairie only covers . However, prairie plants have been planted around the Interpretive Center and along the Prairie Trail. Yellow Lady Slipper and Indian Pipe are some of the uncommon flowers that can be found in the prairies and throughout the rest of the reserve. =Animals= alt=An osprey flying to the habitat created by Hartman. Hartman Reserve has an abundance of animals that can be found throughout the reserve. The most common include white-tailed deer, river otters, turkeys, pileated woodpeckers, red shouldered hawks, foxes, vultures, geese, wood ducks, mallards, ospreys and bald eagles.Hartman Reserve Nature Center - Black Hawk, IA These animals are native to the reserve except for the otter and osprey, which were first seen on the reserve in 1998 after habitats were created to attract them.Coy, M, Frana, M, & Grier, J. (2010). Resource management plan for hartman reserve nature center. Unpublished manuscript, Department of Natural Science, University of Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls, Iowa. Hunting is illegal on all reserve property without special permission. Starting in 1994, Hartman decided to allow bow hunting during a special season to help keep the deer population under control of the Iowa DNR. The hunters are carefully watched to make sure all of their licenses and tags are legal and that their game was legally harvested. These areas are part of the Deer Management Zone and harvested animals may be checked in at the nature center during regular business hours. =Organizations= Hartman is recognized by multiple organizations for its abundance of wildlife. Two organizations that recognize the reserve as a great place for birdwatching and animal watching are Iowa Watchable Wildlife Site and Important Bird Area. Hartman Reserve also partners with the national education program Silos and Smokestacks National Heritage Area. When Hartman was bought in 1976, of land was set aside to form the Hartman Bluff State Reserve, which is now certified by Iowa DNR Preserves Board as a natural forest and prairie. Maple syrup Hartman has been collecting sap from maple trees since 1985. The sap is collected starting at the end of February and throughout March. The sap is then boiled down to produce maple syrup in the Sugar Shack, which is located on the reserve. The syrup is then stored and used during Hartman's annual Maple Syrup Festival. The Maple Syrup Festival is a pancake breakfast that raises money for Hartman Reserve.Anderson, C. (2010). Must Attend: 25th annual maple syrup festival. The Oak, 30(1), 5.

It was initially developed as part of a new advanced chipset, codenamed \\"Rainbow\\" that included a graphics processor and sprite generator. Rainbow was considered for use in the 16/32-bit workstation known as Sierra, but the Sierra project was bogged down in internal committee meetings. However the Rainbow chipset development continued up until Atari's CED and HCD divisions were sold to Tramel Technologies, Ltd. For a time, AMY was slated to be included in the Atari 520ST, then an updated version of the Atari 8-bit family, the 65XEM, but development was discontinued. The technology was later sold, but when the new owners started to introduce it as a professional synthesizer, Atari sued, and work on the project ended. Description The AMY was based around a bank of 64 oscillators, which emit sine waves of a specified frequency. The sine waves were created by looking up the amplitude at a given time from a 16-bit table stored in ROM, rather than calculating the amplitude using math hardware. The signals could then be mixed together to perform additive synthesis. The AMY also included a number of ramp generators that could be used to smoothly modify the amplitude or frequency of a given oscillator over a given time. During the design phase, it was believed these would be difficult to implement in hardware, so only eight frequency ramps are included.\\"AMY\\"Specs 1983, pg. 4 Sounds were created by selecting one of the oscillators to be the master channel, and then attaching other oscillators and ramps to it, slaved to some multiple of the fundamental frequency. Sound programs then sent the AMY a series of instructions setting the master frequency, and instructions on how quickly to ramp to new values. The output of the multiple oscillators was then summed and sent to the output. The AMY allowed the oscillators to be combined in any fashion, two at a time, to produce up to eight output channels. The output was then converted to analog in a separate (user-provided) digital-to-analog converter. While the additive synth system works well for sounds with a narrow spectrum, it is not useful for wider spectrum sounds like white noise. To fill the need to generate the sounds of explosions, jet engines and similar sounds, AMY also included random noise generators that could be mixed into the master oscillator to randomly shift the output. The AMY was particularly useful for digital sound playback given the limited memory and bandwidth resources available at the time. An input sample could be run through a Fast Fourier transform to extract the spectral pattern, and then that pattern could be input to the AMY to set up the oscillators. The result is a highly accurate rendition of the original signal, but reduced to a handful of parameters that could easily be stored. That pattern could then be shifted up or down simply by changing the frequency of the master oscillator, with the slaved oscillators following those changes naturally. In one experiment, telephone- quality voice audio was produced using this method, requiring only 2400 baud of bandwidth. History =Development at Atari= Amy was developed as an experiment within the Sunnyvale Research Lab (SRL) of Atari, starting in 1983. Amy's system design was based on Hal Alles' experimental work at Bell Labs during the 1970s, which produced a similar system that required several racks of equipment to implement the so-called Alles Machine. Several of Alles' solutions to particularly thorny implementation issues were used in Amy. The Amy team was led by Gary Sikorski, and the primary architects were Scott Foster and Steve Saunders. The single-chip implementation was handled by Sam Nicolino, while Jack Palevich and Tom Zimmerman wrote support software. Amy was announced in an Atari-internal mailing list in March 1984, with a short description and a June estimated time frame for shipping the first version, the AMY-1, with volume quantities available that December. The first versions would run up to 5 MHz, but a second run improved this to 10 MHz. Spec sheets used 4 and 8 MHz and basic clock speeds, respectively.Specs 1983, pg. 8 The initial target for Amy was a 16/32-bit computer also being designed by SRL, known as the Atari Sierra. Sierra used Amy for sound and a pair of chips code- named \\"Gold\\" and \\"Silver\\" for graphics, and was considering either the intel 286 or Motorola 68000 as its CPU. Sierra was one of several similar projects being carried out in different Atari divisions, although they used different sound hardware. By the time the AMY-1 was ready for production, Atari was in disarray. In July, Jack Tramiel bought Atari from Warner Communications and quickly dismantled the majority of Atari's engineering departments. The Sierra project quickly broke up. =520ST= Early news articles and development notes for the 520ST mention the AMY as its sound unit. However, by the time it was released, the AMY had been replaced by the off-the-shelf Yamaha YM2149. =65XEM= During this process, the Amy team persuaded them to adapt it for use in the 8-bit machines. The result was the 65XEM, which combined the existing 65XE with the AMY. First shown publicly at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 1985, the XEM carried a premium $30 to $50 above the basic 65XE, which was also being launched at the same show. Tim Onosko and John Anderson, \\"Atari strikes back\\", Creative Computing, Volume 11 Number 3 (March 1985), pg. 59 However, as the company's focus quickly shifted from the 8-bit line to the new Atari ST's being launched at the same time, the XEM was shunted aside and never released commercially. A few prototypes were built, some of which later found their way into the hands of private museums.\\"Atari 65XEM\\", Atari Museum =Sight & Sound= Tramiel later decided to sell off the technology, and reached an agreement with the Milwaukee-based company, Sight & Sound. They developed a new version with 32 oscillators, along with a rack- mount MIDI synthesizer based on it. However, as they were preparing to ship the product, Atari threatened to sue them, and the system never shipped.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Whalley, the archdeaconry of Blackburn and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Construction of the church began in 1837, the architect being Edmund Sharpe of Lancaster. It was one of Sharpe's first commissions and one of his early churches in Romanesque style. The church was founded by Dixon Robinson, steward of the Honour of Clitheroe who, together with his older brother William, partly paid for it. The foundation stone was laid on 22 June 1837. Under the stone a bottle was placed containing coins, medals, and a copy of the Blackburn Standard. An article in the Blackburn Standard suggested that Christ Church was the first to be commenced during the reign of Queen Victoria. The estimated cost of the church was £950 (equivalent to £ in ), towards which the Incorporated Church Building Society contributed a grant of £250. It provided seating for 364 people. The church was consecrated on 18 September 1838 by the Bishop of Chester. On 3 May 1854 the spire was struck by lightning, damaging both the spire and the tower. In 1881 it was decided to enlarge the church, and the architect Frederick Josias Robinson, son of Dixon Robinson, who was practising in Derby, was commissioned to design and supervise this. The nave was widened by the addition of north and south aisles, and the chancel by the addition of a north transept, acting as an organ chamber, and a south transept, used as a choir vestry. This was carried out in 1882–83. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner remarks on the uniform architectural style used by the two architects, writing \\"all is so entirely of a piece\\". Architecture The original parts of Christ Church are constructed in limestone with sandstone dressings and it has a slate roof; the spire is in sandstone. The expansion of 1882–83 is in Runcorn red sandstone, with dressings in Bath stone. The tower has three stages; the lowest stage has two blank arches on each side and two round-headed windows on the west front. There are similar windows on each side of both upper stages, and in the top stage are clock faces. The plan of the church consists of a west tower with a spire, a nave with north and south aisles and a south porch, and a chancel with a semicircular apse. Internally, at the west end is a gallery. The two- manual organ was made by Brindley & Foster of Sheffield in 1890. External features The churchyard contains the war graves of three soldiers of World War I, and a soldier and airman of World War II.

Its name derives from the Anglo Saxon hlaew meaning a mound or cairn, possibly a burial mound or barrow. The mound, situated a quarter mile from the river, was separated from the town by flat swampy land and was seen as a good site for a fortification. William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey probably started to build the castle, an earthwork motte and bailey structure. A ditch, six feet deep and forty feet wide was dug and the spoil used to construct a mound or motte about forty feet high with a flat top about fifty feet in diameter. The castle had two baileys further fortified by timber palisades and these were occupied by stables, workshops and sleeping quarters for the soldiers. Wakefield Castle and neighbouring Sandal Castle were granted to Thomas, Earl of Lancaster in 1318 and in 1324 King Edward II committed them to the care of Richard Moseley. At what time the castle was destroyed is not known but a great gale in 1330 which caused much damage in Wakefield may have been the cause. Excavations in 1953 indicated that the castle was probably an adulterine castle, built without permission, and abandoned unfinished. In July 1558 a beacon was lit on Lowe Hill to warn the population that the Spanish Armada had been sighted off The Lizard in Cornwall. Little remains of the castle, a Scheduled Ancient Monument, which is situated in Thornes Park, other than the motte which is covered in trees.

In 2020, it merged with Gladstone Gallery.Jason Farago (July 20, 2020), Gavin Brown Closes His Gallery and Joins Forces With Barbara Gladstone New York Times. Gallery history =Broome Street= The gallery was established by Gavin Brown in 1994 on Broome Street, in the west SoHo neighborhood of New York City. In 1993, prior to opening the Broome Street location, Brown installed an exhibition of Elizabeth Peyton drawings in a room at the Hotel Chelsea – considered one of the first shows to fall under the umbrella of “Gavin Brown’s enterprise.” The inaugural show at the Broome Street location was an exhibition by the British artist Steven Pippin. Pippin transformed the gallery space into a camera obscura, and in doing so quickly established the unconventional meter that has since become a defining characteristic of the gallery's approach. Other early shows at GBE include a show of paintings by Peter Doig, Catherine Opie photographs, and a two-person show of works by Andy Warhol and Rirkrit Tiravanija. =Relocation to Meatpacking District= In 1997, Gavin Brown's enterprise moved to the Meatpacking District of Manhattan. A few years later in 1999, Brown also opened a bar, Passerby, on West 15th Street next door to the gallery. Notably, the bar featured a fully operated disco floor, Untitled (Dance Floor), created by one of Gavin Brown's represented artists, Piotr Uklański that was first created in 1996 at Gavin Brown's Broome Street Gallery. Exhibitions at the second gallery space included early works by the British painter Chris Ofili, installations by Martin Creed, the first show of work by Oliver Payne and Nick Relph, and in 2000, the first of artist Rob Pruitt’s famed “flea markets.” =Relocation to West Village= In 2003, Brown moved the gallery to Greenwich Street in the West Village. The gallery continued to present atypical shows like “Drunk vs. Stoned” (an irreverent two-part exhibition that explored different states of intoxication and induced convivial openings). In 2007, the Swiss artist Urs Fischer produced his show You by digging a massive crater in the gallery's floor.https://nymag.com/arts/art/reviews/41266/ In that same year, Rob Pruitt staged a second “flea market” at the Frieze Art Fair in London in the GBE booth. In 2008, at Tony Shafrazi Gallery, Gavin Brown and Urs Fischer co- curated Who’s Afraid of Jasper Johns – a large group-show installed over a wall reproduction of Shafrazi's Four Friends exhibition.https://nymag.com/arts/art/reviews/47806/ In November 2008, Jonathan Horowitz installed his exhibition Obama ‘08 that focused closely on the pivotal United States presidential election. In 2008, the Passerby location was closed. Gavin Brown's enterprise relocated to 620 Greenwich Street in New York City. From May 2010, the gallery also occupied the space that its neighbor, famed Manhattan meat purveyors, LaFreida Meats, once occupied. The inaugural exhibition at the expanded site was an exhibition of new work by Horowitz entitled, Go Vegan! =Relocation to Harlem= In summer 2015, Gavin Brown's enterprise closed its Greenwich Street location and moved to a former brewery at 439 West 127th Street in Harlem, with three floors of exhibition space.Hilarie M.

Life Son of an established Hamburg merchant family, Rudolph Crasemann first completed his apprenticeship as a merchant in his hometown of Hamburg. After his education, he remained with the same company he did his apprenticeship in a junior position. After the company was liquidated, he founded Crasemann & Stavenhagen in 1861 with Ernst Friedrich Stavenhagen. In time, the company developed very successful overseas business activities. After Stavenhagen's death in 1875, a younger brother of Rudolph Crasemann joined the company as partner. In 1877 Crasemann became a member of the Commerzdeputation, the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, which he headed from January 1891 to January 1895 and again from January 1915 to January 1917 as president, like his father Claes Christian Crasemann in 1860. Rudolph Crasemann was known for his charitable activities as he contributed to a number of charitable organisations in Hamburg. In 1880 and from 1883 until 1907 he was a member of the Hamburg Parliament (Hamburgische Bürgerschaft). From 1909 to 1912 he served as the Vice President of the Hansabund, an economic órganisation of German merchants and industrialists based in Berlin, and as the head of its Hamburg subsidiary. He was an opponent of the transformation of the Colonial Institute to become the University of Hamburg. In addition to his many commitments, he was member of the administrative board of the German Naval Overseas Federation (Hauptverband der deutschen Flottenvereine im Ausland) which actively promoted an extended German naval presence backed financially through contributions from the overseas subsidiaries. Rudolph Crasemann was married to Juliane Helene Köpcke and together they had six children, amongst them Wilhelm Alfred Hans Crasemann and Helene Crasemann. One of Rudolph and Juliane's granddaughters Dorothea von Salviati, daughter of Helene Crasemann and Alexander Hermann Heinrich August von Salviati went on to marry Prince Wilhelm of Prussia.

News Bank, 10 Jan. 1926. Web. 19 Sept. 2014. during the 1980s. The tarhu has a long slender neck made of Blackwood, a small round body also made of Blackwood, and four strings about the length of 80 cmhttp://www.spikefiddle.com/instrumentsframe.htm It is a flexible instrument that can be played in both plucked and bowed styles derived from both eastern and western cultures. Long Neck Tarhu by Mazdak Ferydooni History and Development The first tarhu prototype was created in 1995, though it was preceded by a number of experimentations with the traditional instruments erhu (China) and yaylı tambur (Turkey) (appropriately, the name \\"tarhu\\" is a portmanteau of the two). Biffin also quotes a wide range of other ancient and modern stringed instruments from both eastern and western traditions, such as the Turkish tambur, the north Indian veena, the Persian kamancha, the middle- eastern duduk, and the double bass, as sources of inspiration, and names a great many musicians and luthiers who played a role in the instrument's development. For example, one of the key elements - the lightweight speaker- like cone - was the result of work some 20 years earlier with colleague Greg Smallman. In 1984, Biffin created a modified yaylı tambur featuring a redesigned body which allowed for the bowing of more than one string simultaneously and the addition of a sound post within the body. It had three playing strings and three sympathetic strings in a channel down the middle of the neck.http://www.spikefiddle.com/historyframe.htm It was not until 1992 that Biffin experimented with a modified erhu. His creation entailed a configuration in which the strings were pressed against a fingerboard (rather than 'fretting' the string mid-air as with the traditional erhu), so as to make it more playable for violinists. Biffin reports that this line of research was fruitful in understanding erhu acoustics.http://www.spikefiddle.com/historyframe.htm From here, Biffin produced in 1993 the \\"bowtar\\" and in 1994 the \\"cone-erhu\\", both based on erhu principles; the former using a gourd resonator and the latter being more of a sculptural study. These also helped Biffin to understand the limitations of certain elements of the erhu in relation to the dynamic range he was trying to achieve. Following the creation of the first tarhu prototype in 1995, where \\"the desire to integrate the Tanbur and Erhu threads of research gave birth to the use of a larger cone and a new bridge design\\",http://www.spikefiddle.com/historyframe.htm some of the key elements of the new instrument were now in place; notably the unique bridge setup: \\"While the Tarhu bridge/cone configuration does not include a sound-post as such, the bridge design performs the same function as a sound-post by transferring vibrations from one plane to another\\",http://www.spikefiddle.com/historyframe.htm but also the configuration of four playing strings and 8 sympathetic strings and indeed the lightweight cone. The tarhui and tenor tarhu, produced in 1998, marked the emergence of the aesthetic ideas now used in the tarhu, with a spherical body constructed of wooden ribs. Biffin then made a series of long-neck tarhus from 1999 to 2003, based on the format of the yaylı tambur. Many of the tarhus built thereafter were made for specific artists, and are designs that are still kept today: 2003: kamancha tarhu with sympathetic strings (Kayhan Kalhor) 2004: kamancha tarhu (Habil Aliyev) 2006: nak tarhu (Ross Daly) 2007: cellhu (Rali Margalit) 2008: shah kaman (Kayhan Kalhor) 2009: kamancha tarhu with alternative sound hole design (Imamyar Hasanov) Over the course of the instrument's young history, Biffin has constructed 19 different models.Biffin , Peter . \\"The Tarhu.\\" Peter Biffin. Web. 19 Sept. 2014. . Today, the bespoke tarhu instruments are championed most notably by the aforementioned musicians, though their popularity is growing and new exponents are constantly emerging. In more recent years, Iranian luthier Mazdak Fereydoonihttp://www.labyrinthmusic.gr/en/instrument-making has also begun work on the tarhu at the Labyrinth Musical Workshop on Crete, and has been producing a number of different models under the supervision of Ross Daly. In 2014, musicians Michalis Cholevas and Ross Daly collaborated with Fereydooni to make a new version of the long-neck Tarhu, shorter than the original one made by Peter Biffin by 1/5. The shorter neck enables faster phrasing and easier balancing.http://michalischolevas.com/index.php/instruments/tarhu Characteristics With Islamic architecture and the shell of a sea urchin as the primary inspiration for the frame of the tarhu, it incorporates carving within the main wooden body of the instrument to resemble those featureshttp://www.spikefiddle.com/instrumentsframe.htm The design creates extremely sensitive instruments with an unprecedented range of sound for long- necked stringed instruments. The efficiency of the cone system gives these instruments a very large dynamic range, and one can create a diversity of different sound. The long-neck is suitable for styles from East and West, using either bow, several different forms of plectra or fingerstyle. The use of 4 strings facilitates playing across the strings (similar to the string- crossing techniques in the violin family), and extends the range of easily available notes to nearly 4½ octaves.

Crimes against humanity International War Crimes Tribunal I found he was guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the following crimes against humanity: *kidnapping of alien children; *forced abortions on Eastern workers; *taking away infants of Eastern workers; *illegal and unjust punishment of foreign nationals for sexual intercourse with Germans; *hampering the reproduction of enemy nationals; *forced evacuation and resettlement of populations; *forced Germanization of enemy nationals; and *utilization of enemy nationals as slave labour.United Nations War Crimes Commission, \\"Law reports of Trials of War Criminals,\\" pp. 33-34, 36 (1997). On a separate charge of carrying out a program of euthanasia, the tribunal found it was carried out by Hildebrandt only against citizens of Germany, and for that reason did not constitute a crime against humanity. Because of his membership in the SS, he was also found guilty of membership in a criminal organization. The Tribunal sentenced him to 25 years in prison, but he was then turned over to Polish authorities for further criminal proceedings.Giles MacDonogh, \\"After the Reich: The Brutal History of the Allied Occupation,\\" p. 464 (2009). As a result of the Polish proceedings, he was hanged in Warsaw in 1952.

Cadmium-Free Quantum Dots There is a move towards legislation that restricts or prohibits the use of heavy metals in products such electrical and electronic equipment. In Europe, the restricted metals include cadmium, mercury, lead and hexavalent chromium.Directive 2002/95/EC Cadmium is restricted 10-fold more than the other heavy metals, to 0.01% or 100 ppm by weight of homogeneous material. There are similar regulations in place, or soon to be implemented, worldwide including in Norway, Switzerland, China, Japan, South Korea and California. Cadmium and other restricted heavy metals used in conventional quantum dots are of a major concern in commercial applications. For QDs to be commercially viable in many applications they must not contain cadmium or other restricted elements. Nanoco has developed a range of CFQD® quantum dots, free of any regulated heavy metals.http://www.nanocotechnologies.com/what-we-do/products/cadmium-free- quantum-dots These materials show bright emission in the visible and near- infra-red region of the spectrum. Nanoco has developed a patented \\"molecular seeding\\" method of QD synthesis.I. Mushtaq, S. Daniels and N. Pickett, Preparation of Nanoparticle Material. US Patent 7,588,828, 15 September 2009 Unlike \\"high temperature dual injection\\" methods of QD synthesis, the molecular seeding method circumvents the need for a high temperature injection step by utilising molecules of a molecular cluster compound to act as nucleation sites for nanoparticle growth. To maintain particle growth, further precursor additions are made at moderate temperatures until the desired QD size is reached. The process can easily be scaled to large volumes, and is used to produce Nanoco's CFQD® heavy metal-free quantum dots. Lighting The white light LED market is hugely important, with the promise of increased lamp lifetimes and efficiencies paving the way for a revolution in the lighting industry.A quantum leap for lighting, \\"The Economist\\", print edition 4 Mar 2010. Colour rendering and efficiency are the two most important criteria for traditional light sources for general lighting. The ability of a light source to illuminate an object's true colour is denoted by its colour rendering index. For example, sodium lamp street lighting has poor colour rendering capability as it's difficult to distinguish a red car from a yellow car. Current white light LED technology utilises a cerium doped YAG:Ce (yttrium aluminium garnet) down-conversion phosphor pumped by a blue (450 nm) LED chip. The combination of blue light from the LED and a broad yellow emission from the YAG phosphor results in white light. Unfortunately, this white light often appears somewhat blue and is often described as \\"cold\\" or \\"cool\\" white. Quantum dots can be used as LED down-conversion phosphors because they exhibit a broad excitation spectrum and high quantum efficiencies. Furthermore, the wavelength of the emission can be tuned completely across the visible region simply by varying the size of the dot or the type of semiconductor material. As such, they have the potential to be used to generate virtually any colour and, more importantly, warm whites strongly desired by the lighting industry. Additionally, by using a combination of one to three different types of dots with emission wavelengths corresponding to green, yellow, and red it is possible to achieve white lights of different colour rendering indexes. Because of these attractive features, QD-LEDsNigel L. Pickett, Ombretta Masala, James Harris: \\"Material Matters\\" 3.1, page 24. 2007. are beginning to receive attention from both industrial and academic researchers. In addition to white lighting for general illumination, there are other opportunities for QD-LEDs. For example, green LEDs are not particularly efficient, thus green- emitting QDs on top of an efficient blue LED chip may be a solution. Similarly, amber LEDs suffer from temperature dependencies and thus a QD solution may be applicable. Furthermore, because of the widely tunable QD emission, it's possible to have near UV-pumped QD-LEDs with combinations of QDs which emit virtually any color on the chromaticity diagram. This could have important applications in signage by, for example, replacing neon bulbs. Displays In recent years, liquid crystal display (LCD) technology has dominated the electronic display device market, with applications ranging from smartphones, to tablets, to televisions. Continual improvements in display quality and performance are sought. The backlighting technology in conventional LCD screens currently uses white LEDs. One of the shortcomings of this technology is that the white LEDs provide insufficient emission in the green and red areas of the visible spectrum, limiting the range of colours that can be displayed. One solution is to integrate QDs into LCD backlight units to improve the colour quality.http://www.nanocotechnologies.com/what-we- do/applications/displays Green and red QDs can be used in combination with blue LED backlights; the blue light excites the QDs, which convert some of the light into highly pure green and red light to expand the range of colours that the LCD screen can display. Biological Imaging Over the years, techniques have been developed for medical imaging using fluorescent dyes, as a powerful tool for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. However, the fluorescent dyes currently used offer poor photostability, with narrow absorption spectra (requiring excitation at a precise wavelength) and/or weak fluorescence due to low extinction coefficients. The development of fluorescence imaging agents using QDs may pave the way for new medical imaging techniques.http://www.nanocotechnologies.com/what-we- do/applications/biological-imaging QDs offer a number of advantageous properties for fluorescence imaging, including high photostability, broad absorption spectra, narrow, symmetric and tunable emission spectra, slow excited state decay rates and high extinction coefficient resulting in strong fluorescence.S.B. Rizvi, M. Keshtgar and A.M. Seifalian. Quantum Dots: Basics to Biological Applications. In Handbook of Nanophysics: Nanomedicing and Nanorobotics; K. D. Sattler; Ed.; CRC Press; Boca Raton, Florida, 2010; p. 1.2 CIGS/CIS Nanoparticles Fabrication of current thin film solar cell technology involves costly evaporation techniques, which is hindering their mass market adoption. CIGS and CIS (copper indium gallium diselenide, copper indium diselenide) nanocrystals or quantum dots allow the use of conventional, low cost printing techniques to fabricate thin film solar cells.Duncan Graham- Rowe: From dots to devices, \\"Nature Photonics\\" 3, 307–309 (1 June 2009). Using a colloidal method to make CIGS and CIS nanoparticles for photovoltaic applications provide materials that possess the desired elemental ratios or stoichiometry, which can be adjusted to meet specific needs. The nanoparticles are passivated with organic capping agents, providing solubility and thus solution processability. In this way, the material can be printed onto a substrate using a wide range of printing techniques, even in roll-to-roll processes. Once printed, the CIGS/CIS materials are heated to remove the organic capping agent, which destroys the quantum confinement associated with the nanoparticles and provides for a p-type semiconductor film possessing the desired crystalline structure.

He was director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute from 1957 to 1961, president of West Georgia College (now the University of West Georgia) from 1961 to 1971, and acting president of the Georgia Institute of Technology from 1971 to 1972.Stevenson, p.4 A graduate of the University of Georgia, Duke University, and Yale University, Boyd began in academia as an instructor of physics at the University of Georgia, then head of the Mathematics and Science Department at West Georgia College. Subsequently, he became a professor at Georgia Tech and a prominent researcher at the Engineering Experiment Station, now known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute. At the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd helped spur the organization's mainstay: federally funded electronics research and development. Along with fellow Georgia Tech researchers Gerald Rosselot and Glen P. Robinson, Boyd was influential in the founding of Scientific Atlanta, where he was a board member for 25 years. As director of the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd focused on the recruitment of talented engineers and an increase in physical space available to the organization, including the establishment of nuclear research at Georgia Tech with a radioisotopes laboratory and the construction of the Frank H. Neely Research Reactor. While he was the third president of West Georgia College, Boyd increased the numbers of faculty members, degrees awarded, programs offered, and enrolled undergraduate and graduate students. Boyd racially integrated the campus in 1963, and oversaw immense construction projects that dramatically expanded the campus to support the increased (and future) enrollment. Hired away to serve as the University System of Georgia's Vice Chancellor for Academic Development in 1970, he was almost immediately reassigned to be Georgia Tech's interim president. During his tenure at Georgia Tech from 1971 to 1972, Boyd resolved difficult issues in the attempted takeover of the Engineering Experiment Station by previous Georgia Tech president Arthur G. Hansen and the poor performance of (and corresponding alumni calls to remove) head football coach Bud Carson. Early career =Education= Boyd was born to Emory Fortson and Rosa Lee (née Wright) Boyd on July 18, 1906 in Tignall, Georgia, a small town near the eastern border of the state of Georgia.Stevenson, p.5 He had two brothers, John and Ellis, and a sister, Sophia. In 1927, he received a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from the University of Georgia, where he was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. In 1928, he received a Master of Arts in mathematics from Duke University. From 1928 to 1930, Boyd was an instructor of physics at the University of Georgia. He entered graduate school at Yale University in 1930, and was a graduate assistant there from 1930–1931 and a Loomis Fellow from 1931–1933. He received his PhD in physics from Yale in 1933, with a thesis entitled Scattering of X-Rays by Cold-Worked and by Annealed Beryllium. In his thesis, Boyd described the effects of reflecting radiation through samples of powdered, cold-worked and annealed beryllium with differing particle sizes. The experiment showed that beryllium crystals are \\"rather imperfect\\", that annealing caused \\"no appreciable change\\" in beryllium's lattice structure, and that the mass absorption coefficient of beryllium found in the experiment was reasonably close to the theoretical value calculated using Compton's empirical formula. Boyd was appointed as head of the Mathematics and Science Department at West Georgia College in 1933. In 1935, he joined the faculty at the Georgia Institute of Technology as an assistant professor of physics. Boyd married Elizabeth Reynolds Cobb, daughter of Betty Reynolds Cobb and Hiram Felix Cobb, on June 2, 1934. James and Elizabeth went on to have two children: a daughter, Betty Cobb Boyd (born August 26, 1939) and a son, James Fortson Boyd (born October 9, 1942).Stevenson, p.6 With World War II under way, Boyd joined the United States Navy in 1942, serving as a lieutenant and later lieutenant commander in the Bureau of Ordnance, performing research on radar. From 1945 to 1946, he was a commander in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations where he worked on radar and electronics. =Researcher and entrepreneur= Engineering Experiment Station, pictured in 1951alt=A brick building with many windows, with a brick street in front of it. There is a large tree on the right side of the image, in front of the building. There are two cars parked next to the building, one in the center and one on the left edge of the image. The building's entrance has the word \\"Research\\" above it. In 1946, Boyd returned to Georgia Tech's physics department and its Engineering Experiment Station, where he worked as Assistant Project Director under Frank Lawrence (and, after Lawrence's departure, as Project Director) on an Army Air Corps- sponsored project studying microwave propagation. As part of the project, he conducted long-range line-of-sight experiments between Georgia Tech and Mount Oglethorpe in North Georgia. In 1947, Boyd co-authored a study entitled Propagation Studies of Electromagnetic Waves, which resulted in a series of related research contracts, including a large one obtained from the Navy Bureau of Ordnance on radar-directed fire control. McMath, p.260 Boyd was promoted to professor of physics in 1948. Around 1950, under the authority of his rank of commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve, Boyd created a U.S. Navy Research Reserve Unit at Georgia Tech that included officers from both Georgia Tech and the Atlanta metropolitan area. In the 1950s, Boyd was promoted to captain and ran this unit until his departure from Georgia Tech.Stevenson, p.1 In 1950, Boyd was named the first head of the newly created Physics Division of the Engineering Experiment Station (now known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute). Boyd recruited his former student Glen P. Robinson to the station.Stevenson, p.2 In late 1951, Robinson, station director Gerald Rosselot and Boyd helped start Scientific Associates (now Scientific Atlanta, part of Cisco) with $700 in seed money to produce and market antenna products that were developed at the station, as the station's leadership did not think Georgia Tech should be involved in the manufacturing business. Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson believed that EES employees' affiliation with Scientific Atlanta constituted a conflict of interest and asked Boyd, Rosselot, and Robinson to choose between the two organizations. Boyd resigned from his post at Scientific Atlanta and remained with Georgia Tech, but chose to retain his position on Scientific Atlanta's Board of Directors. According to Robinson, \\"Dr. Boyd is really considered the founder of Scientific Atlanta.\\" Administrator =Experiment Station director= Neely Research Reactor, which was built in part due to Boyd's influence.alt=The black and white photograph is of a large room that contains a lot of electronic equipment. The lower half of the image contains a cylindrical white container that is a nuclear reactor. There is a walkway at the top of the reactor, which leads back to a control room where two men are sitting. Boyd was promoted to Assistant Director of Research at the Engineering Experiment Station in 1954. He served as director of the station from July 1, 1957, until 1961. While at Georgia Tech, Boyd wrote an influential article about the role of research centers at institutes of technology, which argued that research should be integrated with education; Boyd applied this by involving undergraduates in his day-to-day research. Boyd was known for his recruitment of faculty capable of both teaching and performing notable research. He was influential enough to be able to override the wishes of Joseph Howey, director of the School of Physics, on occasion: for example, Boyd successfully hired physicist Earl W. McDaniel in 1954 over Howey's determined opposition.Stevenson, p.3 Under Boyd's purview, the Engineering Experiment Station was awarded many electronics-related contracts, to the extent that an Electronics Division was created in 1959; it focused on radar and communications. In 1955, Georgia Tech president Blake R. Van Leer appointed Boyd to Georgia Tech's Nuclear Science Committee. The committee recommended the creation of a Radioisotopes Laboratory Facility and the construction of a large research reactor. The former was built and dedicated on January 7, 1959, and could receive, store, and process radioactive materials. The Frank H. Neely Research Reactor was completed in 1963 and was operational until 1996, when the fuel was removed because of safety concerns related to the nearby 1996 Summer Olympics events.Although the shut-down was initially only intended to be temporary, the reactor was never restarted. In 1961, Boyd was succeeded in the directorship by Robert E. Stiemke, who had previously been the director of Georgia Tech's School of Civil Engineering. =West Georgia College president= Boyd became the third President of West Georgia College in 1961 after William H. Row died of a heart attack. Boyd is most known for his peaceful racial integration of the campus (without waiting for a court order) in 1963 by inviting a young black woman, Lillian Williams, to attend the college; she eventually earned two degrees in education and in 1985 received the college's highest honor, the Founder's Award. In May 1964, Boyd invited Robert F. Kennedy to the dedication of the campus chapel as the Kennedy Chapel, which was named after Robert's brother, U.S. President John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated in November 1963. During his visit, Robert Kennedy promoted the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was then under debate in the United States Senate. Boyd dramatically expanded the college during his tenure, both in terms of headcount and academic diversity. Enrolment grew from 1,089 students upon his arrival in 1961 to 5,503 students on his departure in 1971. In 1959, there were two degrees and five programs available; in 1969–70 there were seven degrees and 45 programs. There were 94 graduate students in 1961; the first master's programs were offered in 1967, and by 1969 the number of graduate students had risen to 741. In 1969 alone, 80 new faculty members were hired, a number larger than the total number of faculty members a decade earlier. Several new buildings were constructed, including nine dormitories and five academic buildings. Policy changes occurred as well: in 1966, the curfew for junior and senior women was abolished, and fraternities and sororities were allowed on campus. In 1970, Boyd was named the University System of Georgia's first vice chancellor for academic development, effective once his successor (Emory graduate Ward B. Pafford) was appointed in 1971. Georgia Tech president alt=A man wearing a suit and glasses standing at a podium outside. In a little under a month after Boyd had assumed the vice chancellorship, then-Georgia Tech president Arthur G. Hansen resigned. Chancellor George L. Simpson appointed Boyd as Acting President of the Georgia Institute of Technology, a post he held from May 1971 to March 1972.McMath, p.400 =Engineering Experiment Station= Simpson's selection of Boyd as interim president was influenced by Boyd's previous experience as an academic administrator, his experience as director of the Engineering Experiment Station, and Boyd's ongoing position on the station's board of directors. The chancellor hoped this combination would help resolve a brewing controversy over whether the Engineering Experiment Station should be integrated into Georgia Tech's academic units to improve both entities' competitiveness for federal money.McMath, p.399 The station had sizable and growing support from the state of Georgia and its Industrial Development Council, which developed products and methods and provided technical assistance for Georgia industry.McMath, p.398 However, due in part to efforts made by Boyd and previous station director Gerald Rosselot, the station increasingly relied on electronics research funding from the federal government. In 1971, funding to both Georgia Tech's academic units and the Experiment Station began to suffer due to a combination of a sharp decline in state funds and cuts to federal science, research, and education funding after the end of the Space Race funding boom. Similar institutions, such as the Battelle Memorial Institute, Stanford Research Institute, and the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute had weathered this storm by becoming exceedingly good at obtaining research contracts. Boyd's predecessor Arthur G. Hansen's \\"bold and controversial\\" solution to both entities' problems was to completely integrate the station into Georgia Tech's academic units. On paper, this would dramatically increase Georgia Tech's stated research funding (as all of it would be performed through the academic units), and it would increase options and financial aid for graduate students. Another, less publicized, reason was that Georgia Tech would gain access to the contract organization's reserve fund, which was said to be over $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ).McMath, p.399 Thomas E. Stelson, Dean of the College of Engineering at Georgia Tech, was named to \\"reorganize\\" the station. Publicly, Stelson's task was simply to recommend a plan for reorganization, but the administration clearly intended for Georgia Tech and the Engineering Experiment Station to be closely integrated. Maurice W. Long, who was director of the station at the time, viewed the move as a violation of the EES's charter as legislatively established by the Georgia General Assembly in 1919, and asserted that Georgia Tech did not have the authority to merge the two institutions. EES employees and business executives involved with the station appealed to the Georgia Board of Regents and to Governor of Georgia (and future United States President) Jimmy Carter (himself a Georgia Tech alumnus); the controversy received coverage in both The Technique and the Atlanta Constitution. This was the climate into which Boyd entered as interim institute president after Hansen had announced, on April 27, 1971, that he would be departing Georgia Tech to become president of Purdue University on July 1 of that year. Boyd stopped the plan for absolute absorption of the station, but did allow plans for closer control and more aggressive contract solicitation to proceed. Among these measures were increased resource-sharing, including increased sharing of physical assets and research staff. The latter was evidenced by the increase in joint faculty appointments between the EES and Georgia Tech. The move paid off, and the fiscal year 1970–1971 saw EES win new contracts and grants, totaling a record $5.2 million (equivalent to $ million in ). =Athletic Association= James E. Boyd speaking to the media Boyd had to deal with intense public pressure to fire the then Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football coach, Bud Carson. Georgia Tech alumni – accustomed to success under football legends John Heisman (whose career wins–losses–draws statistics were ), William A. Alexander () and Bobby Dodd () – made repeated calls for Carson's dismissal. The complaints were based on a long list of infractions, including \\"mistreating and humiliating students\\" and \\"unsportsmanlike conduct\\", but the most important issue was his record. The last straw was his season in 1971, which included both a loss to Georgia Tech's longtime rival, the Georgia Bulldogs, and to the Mississippi State Bulldogs in the 1971 Peach Bowl. As institute president, Boyd chaired the Board of Directors of the Georgia Tech Athletic Association, which had been suffering both in win percentage and in finances.McMath, p.401 Traditional sources of Athletic Association income, primarily ticket sales, had declined as a result of both the Yellow Jackets' poor record and the relatively recent establishment of professional football in Atlanta, namely the Atlanta Falcons. Bobby Dodd, then athletic director, had warned for years that Georgia Tech's rising academic standards and its limited curriculum would affect the athletic program.McMath, p.402 At a meeting on January 8, 1972, the Athletic Association board, led by Boyd, ignored a 42-page list of \\"charges\\" drafted by an alumnus, but nevertheless voted to not renew Carson's contract, making him the first Georgia Tech coach to be fired. The board also voted to not accept Bobby Dodd's resignation, which had been offered at the meeting. Carson went on to have a successful career, particularly with the Pittsburgh Steelers.McMath, p.403 On January 21, 1972, Boyd announced that Bill Fulcher had been selected as the new football head coach.

It lies on the southwestern edge of the city, in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia and has a population of 810 (2001). In the area of the district was located a settlement called Solca (, ), historically an independent village, now abandoned.  History  The village of Karviná was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wrocław called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Carvina XI) mansi.I. Panic, 2010, p. 331 It meant that the village was obliged to pay a tithe from 11 smaller lans. The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what would later be known as Upper Silesia. In the document from 1331 it was mentioned under an alias name as Arnoldesdorf which indicates substantial German settlement alongside indigenous Slavic one. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, which was mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among the 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as Arnoldi villa. After the 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans. It was taken from them (as one from around fifty buildings in the region) by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 26 March 1654. In 1776 deposits of black coal were discovered in the village. Its exploitation began in 1794. Subsequently many miners and workers came and settled there. The village developed quickly since then. It was traditionally inhabited by Silesian Lachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect, additionally industrial growth lured a large influx of migrant workers, mostly from western Galicia. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 5,488 in 1880 to 16,808 in 1910. In three censuses majority were Polish-speakers (at least 72.7% in 1880, at most 87.2% in 1900, 82.5% in 1910), accompanied by Czech-speakers (at mat most 16.5% in 1880, dropping to 3.6% in 1900 and growing to 5.2% in 1910) and German-speaking minority (at least 8.1% in 1900, at most 12.1% in 1910). In terms of religion, in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (87.4%), followed by Protestants (10.7%), Jews (174 or 1%), and others (151 or 0.9%). After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. In 1923 the village gained town rights. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. During the war it was for the first time amalgamated with Freistadt. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia, the amalgamation was revoked only to be again adjoined in 1948. As a district it declined heavily in the following decades.  Landmarks  Baroque Saint Peter of Alcantara Church is located there. It was built in 1736. Due to the extensive coal mining in the area, the ground lowered and the church leans 6.8° southwards.Profile at the hrady.cz website The church is now a protected landmark and a memento of the past, reminding the times when coal mining in Karviná was far more extensive. Despite its leaning, the church is still active, with Mass in Czech and Polish languages held each week. Near the church there is located the old cemetery.

The game is a re-imagining of Lewis Carroll's classic 1865 novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. There were multiple sequel games, as well as multiple manga series, licensed in North America originally by Tokyopop and later by Yen Press and Seven Seas Entertainment. An original video animation adaptation was announced for release in November 2008, but was later delayed. An anime film adaptation produced by Asahi Production was released in Japanese theaters in July 2011. Plot Alice Liddell is an insecure girl who is overshadowed by her sister's beauty and grace. During one of their outings, Alice's sister goes to get a deck of cards for a game while Alice falls asleep. When a white rabbit comes and encourages her to chase him, Alice assumes she is dreaming and tries to go back to napping until the rabbit turns into a man with white rabbit ears and carries her off. Peter White (the White Rabbit) throws Alice into a hole that appears in her yard and jumps in after her. When they land in a strange, open area, Peter starts confessing his undying love for her. He tells her to drink a 'medicine' but when she refuses, he simply pours the liquid into his mouth and then kisses her, forcing her to drink it. It is later revealed that whoever drinks this medicine, participates in a game, so says Peter. Alice learns that she is in Wonderland and the only way she might be able to return to her world is to interact and spend time with the strange people in Wonderland, which slowly refills the vial. However, Wonderland is going through violent times—everyone is reckless and uncaring as to who lives or dies, and with a civil war going on everyone in the strange world finds it hard to trust each other with an instinct to kill. Wonderland is split into various countries, with most of the action taking place in the 'Country of Hearts'. It is divided into three main territories: The Castle of Hearts, ruled by Vivaldi (the Queen of Hearts), with assistance from Peter White who serves as Prime Minister, and Ace (the Knight of Hearts), the most skilled swordsman in the Wonderland, who has a terrible sense of direction; Hatter Mansion, home of Wonderland's Mafia, The Hatters, led by Blood Dupre (The Hatter), with help from his second-in-command Elliot March (the March Hare) and the gatekeepers, Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum); and the Amusement Park, run by the marquis Mary Gowland (the Duke) with help from a punkish cat, Boris Airay (the Cheshire Cat). All three territories are at war with each other, with the only neutral area being the Clock Tower Plaza in the centre of the Country of Hearts. Alice moves into the Tower and ends up living and helping Julius Monrey, whose job it is to repair clocks, which work as the hearts of the inhabitants of Wonderland. As a result, he is considered Wonderland's mortician and he gives life to new residents once the Clocks are repaired. Also appearing in the series is the sickly Nightmare Gottschalk (the Caterpillar), a dream demon who is the embodiment of bad dreams and ruler of the neighbouring 'Country of Clover'. Characters =Alice Liddell= ; : (anime film) :One of the very few characters who are similar in personality, physical appearance, and reactions to the original book, Alice is the main character of the series. She reacts to everything a little bit more realistically than the original Alice, questioning her surroundings, however she is still dreamy and absent minded. Many of the other characters note that Alice unintentionally leads them on. Her views on life in general have made her a valuable part of wonderland life. The inhabitants fall in love with her because she values life, not like the people who live there. She often considers returning home, but is dissuaded by painful headaches induced by Nightmare whenever she tries to recall memories of her sisters Edith and Lorina or whether she considers if she has seen Blood before or not. In the manga, she chooses to reside in the neutral Clock Tower with Julius Monrey. She is based on the character from Lewis Carroll's original book, who was named after Carroll's friend, Alice Liddell. =Country of Hearts= The Country of Hearts is the primary setting of the Alice in the Country of Hearts series and the first Wonderland location that Alice visits. The majority of characters in the series originate from this country. The country has the unusual property of changing the time of day seemingly sporadically. ; : :Leader of the Hatters, Blood is charming, flirtatious, laid-back and loves black tea, but is nothing like the Mad Hatter, the character he represents. He rules the Hatter's Mansion area and is strongly hated by Mary Gowland for making his name known throughout the Land of Hearts. He is also involved in a civil war with the Queen of Hearts. Alice notices right away that he looks exactly like her ex-boyfriend. Nightmare created his face to look identically like her ex-boyfriend, though his reasons for doing so unknown. In the beginning, Blood states he has no intention of loving Alice, and discusses trying to kill her. He even attempts to choke her at one point, and shoots at her during a ball held by Vivaldi. However, like many others, Blood develops a strong interest in her, and antagonizes Julius just so Alice will leave Julius to stay with Blood, though she never actually leaves the Clock Tower. It is even suggested later in the manga that Blood is in fact jealous and directs his negative feelings at Alice. In the games, he is a bit less violent toward Alice than in the manga. They share a kiss in the end of the manga. He and Vivaldi are siblings. Blood's weapon is a rifle ; : :Other than having a pair of brown hare ears, Elliot shares no likeness to the March Hare, upon which he is based. He first seems willing to help Alice, until he points his weapon at her and says he wants to \\"test his new gun\\". In the manga, Elliot later comes across as a kind and sweet person with the willingness to kill people without hesitation. Elliot is dedicated to serving Blood, due to the fact that Blood helped Elliot escape prison for a terrible sin. Elliot had destroyed his friend's clock (the people of Wonderland have clocks instead of hearts, and when repaired the clocks become a new person), as his friend had wished. Because Wonderland needs replacements, the act of destroying a clock is taboo and he was thrown in jail. Elliot constantly states that he isn't a rabbit, instead claiming he is a hare, and claims to not like carrots. Despite this, he is shown to enjoy eating carrot dishes. Elliot also has a gun ; : :Twins based on the characters Tweedledum and Tweedledee that besides being twins and finishing each others' sentences on occasion, they look and act nothing like their counterparts. Dee and Dum are the young gatekeepers to the Hatter Mansion. Due to their young age, they often slack off and love money and killing. They have a violent tendencies and actually tried to kill Alice upon first meeting her, thinking that slitting her throat would be a fun game. They don't think life is important, thinking that Alice, like everyone else, will have a replacement. In the second game Clover no Kuni no Alice, they are revealed to be able to transform into adult forms at will. Both twins wield an axe. ; : :Boris is the counterpart of the Cheshire Cat; like the character he is based on, Boris loves riddles. He has functional cat ears and a tail, several piercings and tattoos, and dresses in short, exposing outfits with a pink boa and a collar with a chain. Boris works in the Amusement Park District for Mary Gowland. Though he is a sly, devious character with a childish persona, he becomes close to Alice. He is friends with Dee and Dum, despite the fact that they work for opposing groups, and even goes to Hatter Mansion to have tea parties and interact with Elliot and Blood. Boris has on numerous occasions, snuck into the Castle of Hearts. When his luck ran out, Alice found him badly wounded and bloody, and after a reprimanding from Alice, Boris promised to change his careless and ruthless ways for Alice's sake. When Ace threatens to kill Alice, Boris only shoots at his feet saying, \\"I can't kill you because it would make Alice sad.\\" He gets mad at Ace when he kills in front of Alice. Like many others in the Land of Hearts, he also falls in love with Alice. Boris uses a gun ; : :Boss of the Amusement Park, Gowland is a possible parody of The Duchess as he is a marquis and semi owner of Cheshire Cat. However he gets angry at Boris when he bleeds on his floor. Other than those times he enjoys the company of him and Alice. He is an older man with mood swings, but is generally a cheery and very social person. He has the power to pull out his violin, which turns into a kind of gun or rifle at his will, in various sizes, though he has no talent playing it. He invites Alice to come to the park any time she likes and visits her at the Clock Tower. Gowland is the archenemy of Blood Dupre, who told everyone Gowland's first name is Mary, making his name 'Mary Gowland', like the term merry-go-round. Dupre seems eager to pick fights with Gowland, making fun of him and his name, throwing Gowland into a violent rage. Mery's Violin turns into a variable sized gun ; : :Vivaldi is based upon The Queen of Hearts. Like the character in Carroll's book, she regularly orders the beheading of servants for the smallest of mishaps. She tends to use the majestic plural and is demanding and dangerous. A beautiful and composed woman who shows little emotion, she does expose her feelings towards Blood when Peter and Ace inform her of his interest and advances to Alice. She loves cute things and has a secret room full of stuffed animals. Only a few select maids know of her collection. Vivaldi is secretly Blood's older sister and as the Queen of Hearts, and she is the only person aside from Alice who is able to keep Peter in line. Vivaldi has no weapon ; : :Other than having a pair of white rabbit ears, wearing a watch, and wearing a suit coat he has little in common with the White Rabbit upon which he is based. He is the first to meet Alice and claims to be desperately in love with her; his sociopathic tendencies mean that he will not hesitate to kill anyone he dislikes, especially if they get between him and Alice. Alice mentions hating him on several instances, but he is persistent in gaining her love. Peter is able to turn into an actual rabbit, which he does so in order to gain Alice's affections since she has a soft spot for his rabbit form, and works for the Queen of Hearts in Heart Castle as a Prime Minister. He is often caught rhyming as he speaks, however in the original version he is heard talking normally without rhyming. It appears he and Nightmare know why Alice was brought to his world and it appears he is somehow connected to her older sister. Peter's weapon of choice is a gun he keeps in a holster on his belt. ; : :Ace is an original character, though he is possibly based on the Knave of Hearts. He is the Knight of Heart Castle and considered the most skilled swordsman in Wonderland, but has a notoriously bad sense of direction and often forgets how to get to places. Though, seemingly harmless at first, he becomes more devious over time and demonstrates a tendency towards violence. His lost adventures are revealed to be assassinations of people that the Joker or the Clockmaker want him to kill; he helps Julius Monrey collect clocks from people who have died while killing those who get in his way. Ace is one of the first characters to admit that he has no romantic interest in Alice, though that changes shortly after he says it. Despite confessing to love Alice, she notes how he used her as a shield when Peter threatened to shoot him. He almost kills Alice because she is changing everyone in Wonderland, but mentions that if he killed her, he couldn't hear her heartbeat anymore, so he changes his mind. He is also revealed to be the warden of the prison in Wonderland. Ace is adept with a sword but will use a gun if he has to ; : :Julius is an original character, though it is suggested that he represents Time (who has an argument with the Mad Hatter), from the original Alice in Wonderland book. He is in charge of the only neutral district, the Clock Tower Plaza; it is also shown that he controls the world's time. As the fixer of clocks, he is regarded as the mortician of Wonderland, since the fixed clocks will become the hearts of reborn Wonderland residents. Julius is initially the closest character to Alice; she trusts him and lives in his Clock Tower with him. While seemingly apathetic and anti-social, several characters mention how much he must like Alice because of his eagerness to help her get home and to give her a room to stay in. Later on, Julius shows jealousy towards the other men in Alice's life and tells her to leave, saying that she can go where ever she chooses as he thinks she feels obligated to stay. When Alice refuses to leave, Julius admits that he doesn't find her annoying. As his attachment to Alice grows, he becomes protective of her when other characters threaten to take her away. Alice mentions that Julius is a workaholic; going extended periods of time without food or sleep, and that there were times she returned to find him collapsed on the floor. It is seen that Julius does not like roller coasters, crowds, and Blood Dupre. Julius like most other characters uses a gun =Country of Clover= The Country of Clover is the primary setting of Alice in the Country of Clover, the sequel to the Alice in the Country of Hearts, and the second Wonderland location introduced. While the game retains most of the characters from Country of Hearts, the game removes Julius Monrey and Mary Gowland in favour of two new characters, Pierce Villiers and Gray Ringmarc. Nightmare and Joker, who also appeared in the Country of Hearts, have larger roles in the Country of Clover. In contrast to how time of day changes in the Country of Hearts, the Country of Clover is known for changing its seasons at will. ; : :Pierce is the counterpart of the Dormouse and is the undertaker for the Hatters. He has functional mouse ears and a tail and suffers from insomnia as a result of constantly drinking coffee out of paranoia at the thought of being eaten by Boris. He used to work for the Hatter family, but ran away prior to the beginning of the series due to being terrorized by Boris and the twins. He adores Nightmare because he helps him sleep and is often worried about his health. Pierce is terrified of Boris who often tries to eat him and constantly makes him feel like his life is in danger. However, he likes Peter and Elliot because he doesn't feel threatened around rabbits. In a side chapter of the manga, he attempts to kiss Alice soon as he recognizes her as an outsider. Alice slaps him in the face in response and asks him \\"if he tries to kiss strangers often\\". ; : :Gray is based on the Lizard in the original Alice in Wonderland. He works for Nightmare, though is often reduced to acting as a nanny of sorts in order to force Nightmare to do his work, and tends to be a workaholic, pushing his subordinates to do the same. In contrast, he is notably a poor cook and artist, despite his best efforts. By nature Gray is a kind man who cares for people and animals, but he is also a former assassin and a deadly combatant. As a result, he is unwillingly Ace's designated sparring partner as he is the only one who can match the Knight of Heart's skill. Gray often compares and sees himself as inferior to Julius, particularly in regards to his relationship to Alice. ; : :Nightmare is based on The Caterpillar in the original Alice in Wonderland, but is usually seen when Alice is sleeping. Later, he comes to the clock tower with a resident of Clover. He is the one who allowed Peter to bring Alice into Wonderland. He calls himself an 'Incubus', claiming he is the embodiment of bad dreams. He interacts mostly with Alice, but also appears before Peter, Julius, and Blood as well. It appears he along with Peter knows why Alice was sent to their world. He also claims to love her. He is sickly in the books and is seen coughing up blood, but hates doctors and injections. He wears an eyepatch for unmentioned reasons and seems to not have any weapon. In the second game Clover no Kuni, he is revealed to be the head of the Clover Tower. =Country of Diamond= The Country of Diamond is the third original setting for the series and is introduced in Alice in the Country of Diamonds as another region of Wonderland. While a number of major characters return from the first two original games, many appear in different forms from their previous appearances. Three new characters are introduced, while Vivaldi, Pierce Villiers, and Mary Gowland do not return. ; : :The Queen of the Country of Diamond, Crysta serves as Vivaldi's counterpart in Alice in the Country of Diamond. Though she appears as immaculate as a white pigeon, her neat and clean appearance conceals a far from peaceful personality. She likes frozen things and has made a collection of them; Alice and Nightmare currently number among the two things she wants to freeze most to add to her collection. As with many people in the Country of Diamond, she can appear in the form of a child at certain times and the form of an adult at other times. ; : :Sidney Black is the Black Rabbit and the Prime Minister of the Castle of Diamond. Unlike Peter White, Sidney despises Alice and happens to be very professional when it comes to doing his job, though he is high-strung and gets irritated very easily. He hates the colour white and wants to paint everything black, but endures the Queen of Diamond's love of white as her faithful subordinate. Much to his displeasure, his hair turns white when he is stressed, which increases his stress. As Peter's counterpart, he has short black hair and appears to be a lop ear rabbit with long sloping Black ears. ; : :Jericho Bermuda is the Gravekeeper and head of the Art Gallery in the Country of Diamonds. Based on the Dodo from the original story, Jericho is the head of another Mafia group that is in conflict with the Hatter family, which leaves him rather busy. Because of his role and reputation, people refer to him as the \\"Man Already Dead.\\" =Others= ; : :An enigmatic character who the player must visit and play a card game with in order to change the season in the Alice in the Country of Joker game. Joker is the Circus Master as well as the Chief Prison Guard of Wonderland's Prison Realm. He is not liked by the other roleholders, but is respected by Alice. Two Jokers exist within the story — one is a polite and modest man while in contrast, his counterpart is foul-mouthed and condescending. He also claims Alice needs him. To distinguish the two, Alice refers to the Joker serving as the Circus Master as \\"White\\", while the Joker acting primarily as the prison director \\"Black;\\" though \\"Black\\" appears to be more threatening than his partner, \\"White\\" is implied to be the more dangerous of the two. In Joker no Kuni, they are seen executing Alice's older sister, who symbolizes all the memories of Alice that took place before Wonderland. ; : :Lorina is Alice's older sister, a graceful young lady whom Alice both admires and feels inferior towards. Alice's inability to leave Wonderland is related to painful memories relating to Lorina and Lorina's relationship with Alice's ex-boyfriend, which continues to trouble Alice each time she tries to remember. Though Alice believes her sister was left behind outside of Wonderland, Lorina's appearance in Wonderland's jail reveals the true reason behind why Alice feels a great deal of pain whenever she attempts to remember Lorina. Lorina is based on Alice's older sister in the original novels, who is based on Alice Liddell's older sister Lorina, who was also a friend of Lewis Carroll. ; :Edith is Alice's younger sister, whose memory also brings pain to Alice whenever she tries to remember her. She is said to be attending a boarding school at the beginning of the story, thus she does not accompany Alice and Lorina during their outing that leads to Alice arriving in Wonderland. Alice's only known memory of Edith involves Edith calling Alice coldhearted for not crying at their mother's funeral. Edith is named after Edith Liddell, the younger sister of Alice Liddell and a friend of Lewis Carroll. ; :Known also as the , the King of the Country of Hearts is another role amongst the Wonderland residents, albeit a minor one. He and Vivaldi are not married because their ranks are merely roles, though Vivaldi expresses jealousy that the King would have a mistress when she was available to him and she had ordered the mistress to be beheaded, only for the King to pardon the woman to live as a nameless villager. The King is depicted as a kind and elderly man resembling the King of Hearts on playing cards who has the people's best interests at heart. Because Vivaldi holds the real power in the castle, he does not have much of a presence, though he is actually a very talented person and much more capable than Peter. In the Country of Clover, he possesses a much younger appearance of a middle-aged man. ;Others :Most of the people of Wonderland are servants and guards. They are men and women who all look the same besides the uniforms they wear that represent their district location. They have no eyes and look and dress the same as the other servants in their district. Citizens of Wonderland think these people are unimportant and identical, but Alice is able to recognize their individual differences. In the manga, the faceless are not given names while in the games, there are instances where the faceless are noted to have their own names. :Besides servants, there are also normal citizens that have no roles in the 'game' of Wonderland. People without roles have no eyes and little to differentiate between them. Vivaldi and Blood (who are, coincidentally, siblings) were once normal children without roles. Among the citizens there are some rebels, who try to destroy their friends' clocks so they cannot be replaced.

The third volume of the manga was ranked 25th on the Tohan charts between June 8—14, 2009. Japanator's God Len comments on the \\"lots of kissing and/or yaoi-centric scenes because this one is made for a more female audience.\\" The first volume of Tokyopop's English translation of Alice in the Country of Hearts was part of The New York Times Manga Best Seller List for seven weeks before dropping off the charts, but re- entered a few weeks later for another two weeks on the chart; the volume peaked at No. 5. The first volume again re-entered the chart at No. 5 during the week of July 18–24, 2010. The second volume was on the charts for four weeks, peaking at No. 6, before falling out of the rankings. The third volume was eighth place in its first week, rose to seventh in its second week, but fell to tenth place in its third week, where it stayed for its fourth week. Ed Sizemore enjoyed the \\"pretty-boy\\" artwork and enjoyed Alice's characterization, but felt that the rest of the cast's \\"psychotic\\" characterisation made it uncomfortable to read. Zack Davisson enjoyed the \\"suggestion that Alice is creating the fantasy world from her subconscious, and that the rules set are her own\\", and enjoyed the manga's treatment of the game's story. Carlo Santos thought that the manga could be read as a satire on reverse harems, but felt the first volume lacked plot. Reading the second volume, he felt the plot was still \\"aimless\\", but enjoyed the exploration of \\"non-canon\\" ideas about Wonderland, such as what happens to a Wonderland character after they die. Yen Press' English release of volume one of Alice in the Country of Hearts: My Fanatic Rabbit stayed on The New York Times Manga Best Seller List for six weeks, debuting at No. 7, and rising to No. 3 before falling to No. 9.

They are America’s largest pedorthic retailer.Suffering Soles; Shoes for All Sizes and Styles, Except Those Made of Clay, By BRUCE WEBER Published: December 15, 1994 York Times As well as its retail stores, Eneslow also manages the Eneslow Pedorthic Institute, a pedorthic education and training center at its Park Avenue headquarters. History Ed and Nellie Stone Low Eneslow, originally known N.S. Low, was founded by Edward and Nellie Stone Low in 1909, selling trusses surgical products and shoes on Avenue A. In 1914, Nat Low joined Edward Low, and the business was incorporated. The shoe department flourished and by 1926 the shoe department became so big they decided to make it its own company - Eneslow. The shoe department introduction had been possible because Sol joined Eneslow. The same year, Eneslow moved to 220 East 23rd Street. By the 1940s, the company had attracted the attention of Paul Schwartz, who was a custom orthotics maker, and who owned the wholesale business Apex Foot Health Industries, which sold foot products, particularly orthotics and arch supports. As a wholesaler, he sold his products to Eneslow. His goal was to have a package of feet, orthotics and shoes as a one stop shop. In 1968, Paul and Charles Schwartz bought the company Eneslow and moved its headquarters to 695 6th Avenue. At that time, Eneslow has two other locations, one in Brooklyn since 1949 and one in the Bronx since 1937. In 1973, Robert S. Schwartz joined Eneslow after a 10-year career in sales and marketing. In 1975, Robert S. Schwartz and his brother Richard B. Schwartz, each owned 50 percent of Eneslow and Apex. By the mid-1980s, when he and his brother, Richard, split the company he became the sole owner of the retail division and turned Eneslow into a regional chain with eight stores. But when New York State slashed Medicaid reimbursements for medical shoes and orthotics, the company lost 50 percent of its business and Schwartz shut all but his flagship store located at 924 Broadway, NYC. In 1983, the two businesses – Eneslow and Apex – were split; Robert S. Schwartz bought out Richard B. Schwartz to get full ownership. In 1985, Eneslow bought Classic Mold Shoe Company, makers of custom molded and custom orthopedic dress shoes and sandals and merged it into the company. In 1995, Eneslow Pedorthic Institute (EPI) was founded by Dr. Justin Wernick, DPM and Robert S. Schwartz, C.Ped. In 2003, the company bought a retail store from Selby Fifth Avenue at Horace Harding Expressway in Little Neck, Queens; changed its name to Eneslow and opens its second store. In 2006, the company moved its long-time Broadway headquarters location to Park Avenue South at 32nd Street. In 2009 Eneslow opened a third store on the Upper East Side of Manhattan on Second Avenue between 78th and 79th streets.\\"Eneslow Celebrates a Century\\" Women's Wear Daily In 2016, Michael and Rachel Schwartz - son and daughter of Robert Schwartz are in the business with him, and as the next generation of Schwartz's are celebrating both 50 years of Schwartz Family Ownership and 110 years of Eneslow.

The ARES team sought to be selected and funded as a NASA Mars Scout Mission for a 2011 or 2013 launch window. However, the MAVEN mission was chosen instead. ARES was chosen as one of four finalists in that program. ARES would have traveled to Mars compactly folded into a protective aeroshell; upon entry in the thin atmosphere, the capsule would have deployed a parachute to decelerate, followed by ARES release at altitude. Among other things, the aircraft would have investigated the atmosphere and weak magnetic field. Design ARES would transit to Mars via a cruise stage and enter the Martian atmosphere in a traditional aeroshell with heat shield. At the right altitude it would unfold itself into its flight configuration. Propulsion would likely have come from a bipropellant rocket engine, which was a focus over other types of propulsion during its development, but propulsion remained undetermined. The two main criteria used to evaluate the propulsion system were flight range and implementation risk. Possible propulsion technologies were electrical motors, internal combustion and rocket systems. The aircraft was intended to fly for about one hour.

Life  Palladius come from a noble family,. This statue-base was found in 1926 on the Aventine Hill in Rome, near Sant'Anselmo monastery east of via Santa Sabina, close to the remains of a Roman house. The base is now at the Musei Capitolini (inv. 7056), in the Giardino Caffarelli of the Palazzo dei Conservatori (Arthur Ernest Gordon, Illustrated introduction to Latin epigraphy, University of California Press, 1983, , p. 181-182). that gave several high officers to the imperial administration. It is known that he had a brother, who set up a statue in his honour near his house on the Aventine Hill; the inscription on the base gives Palladius' career in detail. Early in his career he was quaestor and pretor candidatus, notarius et tribunus at the Imperial court, and comes sacrarum largitionum (probably in 408/409, if he is to be identified with the Palladius that was in Rome at the time of Alaric's first siege). In 416 Palladius was appointed consul, at the same time as the Eastern Emperor Theodosius II held the same position in Constantinople. On January 7, 416, he also assumed office as Praetorian prefect of Italy, Illyricum and Africa, which he held for six years (at least until July 28, 421, but his first possible successor is attested only in 422). On April 30, 418, he received a law from Honorius, directing him to expel the Pelagians from Rome; later he and the other prefects (Monaxius and Agricola) issued a praetorian law against the Pelagians. He is probably to be identified with the tribunus et notarius who was in Rome in 408, during the first siege of Alaric.F. Paschoud, Historie nouvelle, III, Paris, pp. 282-283; Santo Mazzarino, Il Basso Impero, Edizioni Dedalo 1980, p. 386. In this occasion Palladius was to gather from the Roman aristocrats the jewels needed to pay for Alaric's tribute, but he could not obtain enough and was obliged to proceed to despoil the residual decorations of the Pagan temples of the city.Zosimus, Historia nea, V.41. On four occasions he was appointed envoy by the Roman Senate.  Notes   Sources  * Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, \\"Fl. Iunius Quartus Palladius 19\\", p. 822-824.

Shell description  The shell is smooth, shining, not striate spirally, generally somewhat more depressed, deep chestnut or reddish brown. Whorls are a little flattened near the suture. The species may have subtle spiral striation, although there exists considerable variation; axial growth lines are clearly visible. The operculum is horny, diaphanous, concave externally, cartilaginous within, the nucleus projecting internally; with from ten to fourteen very narrow whorls, their rather lamellar outer edges slightly free. Amphicyclotulus amethystinus has spiral threads absent or only weakly present. There are found only two species in the genus Amphicyclotulus in Dominica. The other species is Amphicyclotulus dominicensis and it has spiral cords clearly present and raised. { Apical view of the shell. Width of the shell is 14.1 mm. Apical view of the shell.

Today, it usually refers to the practice in many parts of Germany, such as the Palatinate, for a celebration or festival involving the ceremonial slaughter of a pig reared or bought by a private household or an inn for that purpose. The menu for such a Schlachtfest in the Palatinate includes soup (Metzelsuppe), various sausages (Pfälzer Leberwurst, Blutwurst and Bratwurst), liver dumplings (Leberknödel), boiled belly pork (Wellfleisch) and Sauerkraut. It was common when a pig was slaughtered at home that Metzelsuppe was given as a gift to neighbours, often in milk churns. Frequently the neighbours bought some of the fresh sausages so produced. Wine was drunk with the meal. The slaughter of a pig by an inn was called a Schlachtfest. Within the village everyone knew it was happening because a pig's bladder would be hung up outside. Occasionally this is still the case today. The organisation of a Schlachtfest at home and giving Metzelsuppe and sausages to family members and neighbours is still fairly common today in the German-speaking world e.g. in Swabia or Lower Saxony.

The race is usually held on the second weekend of August. Players paddle their crafts for one or two days (with a night of rest in between) to checkpoints along the river where they encounter characters acting out a storyline that continues from year to year. At these checkpoints participants play a variety of games, collect items, and through their actions alter the course of the storyline.  History  File:Paddlequest2002.jpg = 2002 = The Backwaters Paddle Quest canoe- adventure race event was created by Matthew D. Kirsch in a 2002 . The video featured three commentators who treated the canoe antics as serious and highly competitive. The first Paddle Quest was held in the Town of Hull and the participants consisted of three teams of three. Each team had a unique path along the river and were followed by an accompanying camera crew. The event was intended to last two days, but only took 8 hours. The winning team, Team Arrr! finished in less than six hours. File:Paddlequest2003.jpg = 2003: Legends = In the second year of the quest, the event was more developed and although the storyline was not as structured as it would later become, the race was held in relatively the same form as it is today. Channel 7 News WSAW was at Kirsch Camp covering the start of the event as participants paddled to checkpoints along the river, visiting characters such as: Lord Houlihan, Lord of the Marsh, Queen Nestra,Lord of the Backwaters(later called simply, The Wizard). At the Queen of the Lagoon, teams had to take one of the \\"Queens\\" to the party barge. The Queen had to get in an innertube and be towed up river. Along the way, each Queen had a unique challenge. The first day ended at Max Haviland's Island where the questers camped and started off again Sunday morning. At the end of the day on Sunday, the race finished at Kirsch Camp. \\"Team Phoenix\\" was victorious and were named the \\"Protectors of the Backwaters\\". Team \\"Tiny Boogers\\" took second place, team \\"Arrr!\\" took third and the \\"Little Pink Mafia\\" took fourth place. During the second day, Queen Nestra paddled to a spot different from the spot marked on the maps issued to the teams, which created much confusion. This led to the origins of Queen Nestra's storyline. File:Paddlequest2004.jpg = 2004: Highjinks = In the third year of the quest, the event was moved to Bahamas Lounge on HWY 10 west in Stevens Point. The new location gave teams access to food and beverage service as well as providing more space for boats. 10 teams participated in 2004, marking a sharp rise in attendance and a change in the structure of the race. 2004 Highjinks welcomed the introduction of Alpha Station and Bravo Station: pontoon boats that offered the teams different challenges. Upon completion of one challenge at a station, the team would receive an additional map leading to another challenge. If teams completed all challenges at both stations, they would receive a map to a Bi-Force, a circular two-piece puzzle with the letters 'P' and 'Q' etched on the pieces. Highjinks also marked the first appearance of the Pirates1. 2004 Highjinks featured one of the most difficult challenges to date: The Tow. Teams had to tow people from the Alpha Station, to the Bravo Station. This proved to be incredibly difficult, as the distance was nearly three miles and the passengers were heavy adults. Arrr! was victorious and they were named the Protectors of the Backwaters. Team NOYC placed third, and were the first Paddle Quest team to complete a Bi-Force puzzle. File:Paddlequest2005.jpg = 2005: Fantasy = In the fourth year of the quest, the current storyline of PaddleQuest took shape. The questers started at Bahamas Lounge and tracked down the characters using their maps of the backwaters. Queen Nestra was again lost in the Marsh and Questers had to find her. Bear, once a quester himself, was stuck on a southern island and had gone mad after his defeat in 2004. On this island he lived for a year, fighting off attacks from the Pirates. Team Arrr! managed to bring a Paddle Quest Hero named White Lightning to the island, where he would stay until the following year in 2006. The Wizard, who was living on a northern sand bar, recruited teams to bring him his Star Stones which were 80lb boulders that teams had to transport across the distance of about 6 miles. The Evil Sorceress Sheera showed up in the backwaters and had teams gather magical items from around the backwaters for her: Meat from Bear, runes from the Wizard, blow-up damsels in distress from the Bog Demon and a cocktail from Bahamas bar. The King of the backwaters held court at Kirsch Camp, and played chess against the teams on an oversized chessboard. Across the pond from the King, the Bog Demon, summoned by the Evil Sorceress, lurked in the swamp guarding five blow-up damsels in distress. One team, the Juicy Fruities, got too close and were tipped. Team Speedwagon was able to also bring protection to Bear as well as transport a Star Stone to the Wizard, gaining enough tokens to be named the Protectors of the Backwaters. In second place were the Robot Monkey Ninja Pirates. Twelve teams competed in 2005 Fantasy and a video was produced for each team, highlighting their efforts. Other notable events were: The Jester's dog race, The Barbarian's tennis ball dodge and rock throw, and Evil Amy's swamp jog. The Pirates were also more prominent, with more regalia and managed to steal more items from the teams. One team member from The Burnouts, Kelly Hagen, traveled all the way from California to compete. File:Paddlequest2006.jpg = 2006: Genesis = In the fifth year of the quest, sixteen teams gathered at Bahamas Lounge to compete. Kirsch planned to shoot the 2006 event as a feature-length film and assembled 12 cameras and operators to shoot the event. The evil Sorceress Sheera has gained power from all the magical items collected in 2005, and summoned a pontoon boat called The Suffer Scow. From this vessel she trolled the backwaters searching for Queen Nestra. When teams boarded her ship, she offered them a challenge to whip each other with a horse whip and swim through mud for tokens as well as swear their allegiance to her (which many teams promptly broke). In 2006, the currency used for the event were Fish_Discs2, also referred to as tokens. On day 2 of the event, Sheera the evil Sorceress along with the Bog Demon captured the three prophets and Queen Nestra herself. Teams were challenged with the task of rescuing them. To rescue a prophet, teams had to have already collected a Bear medallion, a power helm, and a magic cape. To rescue Queen Nestra, teams needed to have all of the aforementioned magical items as well as a completed Bi-Force puzzle. Holding the Bi-Force high, Captain Nick Hegarty of team Arrr! rescued the Queen aboard a PaddleQuest hero vessel and delivered her to Bear. Bear and Queen Nestra then formed a secret love affair which would frame the events of the following year in PaddleQuest 2007. The band Elf Lettuce played at the 2006 festivities. File:Paddlequest2007.jpg = 2007: Omens = In the sixth year of the quest, 13 teams gathered at Bahamas Lounge where the King and Bear faced off against one another in a heated debate, with the Questing teams watching. The King called Bear a traitor and Bear accused the King of allying himself with the Sorceress. Teams had to choose sometime during the first day, either to side with Bear or with the King and the Sorceress, who were indeed forming an alliance. The Bog Demon had captured damsels at Lakeside Bar and he was trying to breed with them. At Club 10, just south of Bahamas, the Sorceress made teams perform \\"Sacred Rights\\" in order to gather spiritual energies. The sacred rites consisted of: whippings, head-shavings and signing and dancing around the fire-pit. Just off-shore from Club 10, the Merrill Merchants had a ski boat and were taking one member of a team waterskiing for tokens. Further North, Bear was aboard Alpha Station with Queen Nestra seeking questers to join them. Teams that elected to join Bear were adorned in yellow arm and head bands. The King and Prophet Steve were aboard the Bravo Station nearby, and were trying to gain the allegiance of teams also. Heavy winds during the first day of competition eventually ended the events early as a thunderstorm loomed. To the far west, The Dark Prophet and Bad Kirsch were aboard the suffer scow and challenged teams to roll 10 sider of fate. This dice game sent teams into the mud, made them chug hot root beer, etc. On the second day of 2007 Omens, the teams all gathered in the Kirsch Camp lagoon. Teams that had sided with Bear camped out at the Wizard Pond just across from Kirsch Camp. Teams that sided with the King and the Sorceress, stayed at Kirsch Camp. The King's army was to defend the \\"Heart Stone\\" which was a circular red orb that gave the holder power over the area. Bear's army outnumbered the King's by about 11 to 3, and the first attack was victorious. Because of the vast numbers of Bear's army and disagreements about the validity of the first attack, the \\"War\\" was reset and again resulted with Bear's army winning. As a result, Bear and Nestra took the throne and the King was banished to the backwaters in his kayak. The Killer Guppies, who led Bear's army, were victorious and named the protectors of the backwaters as they collected the most tokens. In a close second were the Red Neck River Rats, led by Captain George Clarke. File:Paddlequest2008.jpg = 2008: Invasion = In the seventh year of the quest, 18 teams gathered at Bahamas Lounge to quest. In 2007, the Bog Demon had kidnapped damsels to breed and the Questers had saved all but one- and the spawning had occurred. His eggs were laid in a northern bog and two Bog Babies had already been spawned. At the start, Pirate Captain Abraham Abraham motored his Pirate barge nearby Bahamas screaming threats to Bear and to the Questers. Bear warned of the eggs hatching and also that teams should try to find the lost King. The Alpha Station was refurbished in 2008, and was transformed into the Alpha Bistro, a , twin-engine behemoth pontoon. Characters aboard were White Lightning, Black Thunder, Prophet Amy and other heroes. at Lakeside Bar, the Bog Demon and the Dark Damsel along with their Bog Babies – put the teams through a variety of challenges. To the north, the King's Wizard (now sided with Bear) and Prophet Steve – had found the eggs and the questers had to collect and destroy the eggs. Nearby on Pirate Island, teams played \\"Red Neck Croquet\\" in which players would swing sledge hammers to bowling balls, pushing them through rebar hoops. To the east of Pirate Island at Grubba Marina, Freedle Frogesh challenged teams to play in his collection of games (badminton, leap frog, burping) and defend his collection of Power Orbs which defended his camp from Pirate intruders. The Pirates, realizing that Bear was distracted by the Bog Demon, were attempting to take Grubba Marina for their own. Captain Abraham Abraham spent the first day trying to get teams to join him in his battle for Grubba Marina. Meanwhile, Freedle Frogesh was raising his own army. At Kirsch Camp, Bear and Nestra along with Lady Cornelia offered a variety of challenges such as a water balloon launch and canoe-disc. North of Kirsch Camp, Kekoa and Lalani, Hawaiian warriors from Halloween Island put questers through several different challenges. The Killer Guppies found The King adrift in the backwaters and delivered him to Bravo Station and the Righteous Monkey. The Monkey then delivered the King to Lakeside Bar, and because the Bog Demon's spawning inevitably failed, the King was able to pacify the Bog Demon and they formed a friendship. Nearby at Club 10, Sheera the Evil Sorceress continued to gain power by shaving the heads of questers. On day 2, she had enough power to not only capture the Alpha-Bistro, but also to corrupt White Lightning, Black Thunder and the Wizard. Together they sailed the backwaters and forced questers to perform different kinds of humiliating tasks. In preparation for the war on day 2 at Grubba Marina, Captain Abraham Abraham did not gather many teammates and Freedle was victorious. Freedle was aided by the Killer Guppies and O' Fools!, and the Pirates were promptly expelled. The Killer Guppies were victorious in 2008 and again named the Protectors of the Backwaters. This was the third victory for Paul Leonard, Captain of the Guppies. File:Paddlequest2009.jpg = 2009: Revelations of the Great Spirit = In the eighth year of the quest, the Evil Forces began to shift into power. Teams again gathered at Bahamas Lounge despite a forecast of thunderstorms throughout the weekend. At the start, Bear gathered the Questers to warn about the Sorceress opening a portal on the Alpha-Bistro. Suddenly, the Alpha-Bistro loomed near with the Sorceress screaming out for Bear to give up. The Wizard, corrupted by the Sorceress, was very vocal, condemning the backwaters and the Kingdom of Bear. White Lightning, also on board, leapt off the ship after the crowd chanted for him to return to the side of good. The King of the backwaters had set up camp at Lakeside Bar where he now worked as a bartender. The Bog Demon and the Dark Damsel lived there as well, challenging teams to a variety of challenges. The Evil Sorceress had taken control of the Alpha- Bistro and was attempting to open a portal to another dimension. This portal would bring an ancient evil into the backwaters. In order to do so, she had to create a circle of evil that would open this gateway. To stop her efforts, questing teams had to gather different animal spirits from around the backwaters that would ultimately summon the Great Spirit, who would help stop the Sorceress in her tracks. The teams had to gather: Eyes of the Hawk, Tail of the Squirrel, Bracelet of the Frog, Band of the Deer, Foil of the Musky, Medallion of the Bear, and Feather of the Turkey. On day 2, Kekoa, Bear and the King were reconciled and joined the Bog Demon on the Bravo Station barge- uniting in revelry. The Sorceress and the Pirates had also formed large armies and in the final battle, the portal was incomplete. To determine the winner in the stalemate, a race back to The Bahamas was initiated, and the teams paddled fiercely back to the bar. Team Bath Time Fun was nearly at the dock to win, but capsized with about 20 feet to go. Second place was a team that was disqualified for false registration and incorrect pairing, meaning they were not co-ed. In third place was JLA, who were sided with the Evil Forces. On top of JLA winning this race, Team Bangarang! was named the protectors in 2009. They had collected all of the animal spirits and they had been turned undead. This allowed the Evil Sorcress to then open her portal unchallenged. The Chicago group Snuckafoo played at Paddle Quest 2009 with songwriter and performer, Jonathan Kirsch. = 2010: New Order = In the ninth year of the quest, queersters gathered at the new location (Lakeside Bar) to set forth on yet another quest. This was the first year that featured pre-registration and 26 teams had done so. Also introduced were the three classes: Class A, class B and class K. The event was being held as a fundraiser for the Boys and Girls Club of Portage County. 90 FM and the OZ were present to broadcast from the Saturday morning freakshow. At the event, the final tally was 26 teams(22 Class A team, three class B and one Class K). Class A featured coed teams of three, Class B teams of two and Class K were solo kayakers. At Lakeside Saturday morning, the King addressed the many queersters asking for their allegiance and to aid in the retrieval of the many Imps that plague the backwaters. Then Nukpana, the evil Imp lord who was summoned through a portal to another dimension, appeared and also asked for the queersters help before he was chased away by Bear who was now aligned with the King. As Bear addressed the crowd, the Bistro loomed close and Sheera and the Wizard called out to the queersters to ignore Bear and the King and to join them instead. There were about 19 treasures, 8 event locations and 30+ character volunteers.

Although seconded to aviation duty during the First World War, he returned to his Dragoon Guards regiment after the war ended. Horn then served in India in the 1920s and 1930s, while his cavalry unit modernised to tanks. Horn would serve in India during the Second World War, and retire from active duty on 3 October 1946, and from the reserves on 15 November 1950. Biography =Early life and background= Horn was the youngest of seven children born to Penelope Elizabeth Belt and William Austin Horn. His two older brothers were born in Australia, but Horn's parents sailed back to England and landed the day before Horn was born.Shores et.al. (1990), p.199. =World War I= After passing out from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, as a \\"Gentlemen Cadet\\", Horn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 3rd (Prince of Wales's) Dragoon Guards regiment on 1 October 1914. He was promoted to lieutenant on 27 September 1915. On 29 February 1916 Horn was seconded to the Machine Gun Corps (Cavalry Branch), and was later transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, being appointed a flying officer on 3 April 1917. His first assignment after training was to No. 60 Squadron RFC, from April to November 1917; where his flight commander was Billy Bishop. Horn scored his first two victories while flying a Nieuport fighterFranks (2000), p.30. for 60 Squadron on the second and sixth of May 1917. The squadron upgraded to the Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a. On this new mount, Horn and William Molesworth set an Albatros D.III afire on 5 August 1917. When Bishop transferred out of the squadron to form and command No. 85 Squadron RFC, Horn took his place as \\"C\\" Flight commander on 29 August 1917 with the acting-rank of captain. Horn went on to run his string to six victories by 5 September 1917. In October 1917 Horn was awarded the Military Cross. He then went to instructor duty at Ayr with the Home Establishment. He thus had over an eight- month lapse before he began scoring again as a flight commander in No. 85 Squadron; Bishop had him transferred in March 1918. Beginning on 30 May 1918 and ongoing until 17 September 1918, he reeled off seven more wins. His final tally was seven enemy planes destroyed, six driven down out of control. Horn was promoted to captain in the 3rd Dragoons on 5 December 1918, and on 4 December 1919 relinquished his temporary commission as a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force to return to his regiment. =Inter-war career= In October 1922, while based at Sialkot Cantonment, India, the 3rd Dragoon Guards were merged with the 6th Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers) to form the 3rd/6th Dragoon Guards, and Horn was appointed a captain in the new regiment, with seniority from 5 December 1918. Horn went onto half-pay between 15 November 1922 and 15 February 1923, and the following day was seconded to the Staff, finally returning to his regiment, now based at Tidworth Camp, Wiltshire, on 9 April 1927. In 1928 the 3rd/6th Dragoons were renamed the 3rd Carabiniers. Horn was promoted to major on 4 October 1931. The 3rd Carabiniers returned to Sialkot in October 1936, where they were converted from cavalry to tanks, joining the Royal Armoured Corps in early 1939. =World War II= The 3rd Carabiniers remained in India during the war, and Horn was promoted to lieutenant-colonel, taking command of the regiment, on 24 October 1941. On completion of his period of service in command on 24 October 1944, Horn remained on full pay as a supernumerary officer. His papers, held in the Imperial War Museum, make references to his involvement in deception planning prior to the Normandy landings and in the liberation of Norway. =Later life= Horn retired from the Army on 3 October 1946, but remained in the Reserve of Officers until 15 November 1950. He died at Aldbourne, England, on 18 October 1969.

The cooking process produces sausage juices which, together with any split sausages, are used as a soup known as Metzelsuppe. As a result, in many places, e.g. in parts of the Palatinate, the entire festival and the meal in particular, is known as metzelsupp. Common accompaniments to a Schlachtplatte are sauerkraut and bread or potatoes or, in South Germany, potato pancakes (Dotsch or Reiberdatschi). Other elements might be fresh Bratwurst and Mettwurst or raw, spiced bratwurst filling. In Rhinehessen it is also common to enrich the dish with a sauce from part of the pig's blood (Schweinepfeffer or Schwarz Brie). The word is derived from schlachten, \\"to slaughter\\", and Platte, \\"dish\\", because, traditionally, it is only eaten on the day of slaughter; before the invention of refrigerators blood and sensitive organs like liver had to be prepared straight away. Meat, which did not have to be consumed immediately was preserved by salting, drying and smoking. The slaughtering day offered a rare opportunity to eat fresh meat which explains why the Schlachtplatte is a rather lavish meal. Originally these slaughtering days took place mainly in the autumn. This meant that not so many animals had to be fed over the winter, the meat could be preserved for longer in the cooler temperatures and the farmers had more time after the last harvest for turning it into ham and sausages which could then be smoked over the winter hearth fire.

EPA's were created by the Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985. It soon became apparent that the law relating to mental incapacity remained inadequate and between 1991 and 1993 the Law Commission published a series of consultation documents. In 1995 it published a report Mental Incapacity, Law Commission report Mental Incapacity which recommended the abolition of EPAs, noting that they could not handle health or welfare issues and assumed that a person either had mental capacity or did not. No provision existed for a partial intervention in a person’s affairs where the person concerned had partial or fluctuating capacity. The Law Commission proposed the introduction of Continuing Powers of Attorney (CPAs). These were subsequently enacted by the Mental Capacity Act 2005 as Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPAs). The Mental Capacity Act 2005 came into force on 1 October 2007 and no new EPAs can now be drawn up; however, one signed before that date remains valid and may still be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian. This is required when the donor begins to lose mental capacityMental Capacity Act 2005, Schedule 4, paragraph 4(1). Unlike an LPA, an EPA can be used without registration for so long as the donor has mental capacity.

The battle resulted in the defeat of Mladen II, who lost his power. Background After the death of Paul I Šubić of Bribir (), Ban of Croatia and Lord of all of Bosnia, on May 1, 1312, his properties and titles were passed to his eldest son Mladen II, who already ruled over Bosnia before as a Ban of Bosnia. The young Croato-Hungarian king Charles I Robert of Anjou dynasty, who did not yet have power over the country, tolerated an unlimited and intangible rule of Mladen II over his territory, because Mladen's father had helped Charles to come to the throne. Eventually, Mladen II came into conflict with the Croatian noblemen in his broader neighbourhood, like the counts of Krk (future Frankopans), Kurjakovićs (counts of Krbava) and Nelipićs, with some Dalmatian coastal towns (Šibenik, Trogir), with Stephen II Kotromanić (), Bosnian nobleman, and again with the old adversary – the Republic of Venice. The turbulent events that followed in the next few years (from 1317 until 1322) were marked by and full of revolts, rebellions, sieges, armed clashes, changes of sides (going over to the opponent's side), maneuvers, and tactical deceptions of both sides. John Babonić (), Ban of Slavonia, was also involved, having received support of the king who was convinced that the time had come to weaken the power of the Šubić family. Troop deployment The troops of Mladen Šubić were composed from his own men, as well as that of his brother Juraj (George), who also took part in the battle. It also included the Vlach troops as well as the lesser nobility of the Poljica region. The opposing army was composed primarily of forces loyal to the king, under Ban of Slavonia John Babonić, along with the coalition of the rebellious nobles, including Mladen's brother Paul II, who betrayed him with the intent of securing the position of ban for himself. These troops were also aided by reinforcements from the Dalmatian cities Trogir and Šibenik. =Battle= There are no detailed facts left about the battle itself, but it is known that Mladen II suffered a defeat. He himself, as well as his brother George II, saved his life and temporarily found shelter in Klis, George's fortress. Blizna Donja – the present day look of the place of battle Aftermath and consequences Not long after the battle, the king Charles I Robert appeared in southern Croatia, leading his army, trying to calm down the situation. At the assembly held in the Knin fortress on October 8, 1322, the winners of the battle of Bliska were given (or confirmed) the properties and privileges by the king, whereas Mladen II Šubić of Bribir lost his freedom and was taken to Hungary. There he spent the next twenty years or so in custody at the Court, until his death between 1341 and 1343. The battle of Bliska meant the end of enormous power and influence of the main branch of the princes of Bribir led by Mladen II. He tried to maintain the hold over the other Croatian clans, but was unsuccessful. He lost a great part of the former estates, land, castles, and towns held by the Šubićs, and their hereditary right to be bans of Croatia as well. King Charles chose, namely, John Babonić to be the Ban, whereas Stephen II Kotromanić became the Ban of Bosnia. Further consequence was the strengthening of other Croatian noblemen, especially the members of Nelipić family and the princes of Krk (Frankopan). However, the brothers of Mladen II (George II, Paul II, Gregory () and Mark ()) as well as their sons (Mladen III, George III (future George I Zrinski), Paul III, Božidar and Pribko), abode and kept their old properties for almost the next thirty years. It was only when the new Croato-Hungarian king Louis the Great started to reign in the forties of fourteenth century, that he, by exchanging the estates, partially succeeded in displacing the members of Šubić family.

Some of the music was devised during a series of improvisational workshops. It was commissioned by Hackney Music Development Trust and premiered in the Hackney Empire theatre in 2004. The opera has been described by the novelist, Margaret Drabble as \\"one of the most exciting community events I’ve ever seen.\\"Margaret Drabble (quoted on the official website of Hackney Music Development Trust) The story concerns the life and prophecies of the 17th Century mystic and resident of Hackney, Hannah Trapnell. The opera is set in Hackney during the oppressive reign of Oliver Cromwell. Hannah leads the people of Hackney on to London Fields where, in a series of increasingly vivid prophecies, she sings of a new proto-Marxist Kingdom of Heaven. Among her followers are an idealistic young couple called Deborah and Abel. Eventually the meeting is brutally suppressed by a group of Puritan soldiers led by Sir Bawnagayne Surly. Abel tries to oppose the soldiers and is killed. The opera ends with his young widow singing a poignant lullaby to the couple's unborn child. For the original production Matthew King composed for a cast of four professional singers (Sally Burgess, Alison Buchanan, Simon Thorpe and Jonathan Gunthorpe) and several choruses of Hackney residents, including a children's choir and a Gospel choir. The orchestra was the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, supported by Young Jazz Hackney; the Cambridge Heath Salvation Army Band; Hackney Centre for Young Musicians, a Turkish Saz band and an African Drumming group called Emashi. The opera makes use of spatial distribution of players and instrumentalists with the brass band playing in the upper circle of the theatre and other groups distributed around the building and off-stage. The opera critic and musicologist, Rodney Milnes, described the event in the following terms: > The scale was daunting. There were five orchestras, with the Academy of St > Martin in the Fields in the pit, plus jazz and brass bands (Henze would like > that) dotted about the auditorium...There were more than 150 singers, of > every known age, race and gender.Milnes, Rodney, Review: On London Fields, > Opera, 2004 (republished on the official website of the Hackney Music > Development Trust) Writing in The Evening Standard, Stephen Pettitt was also largely enthusiastic about the work: > King's music is eminently approachable, veering between jazz and a sort of > energetic minimalism.

Season 1 consisted of 39 episodes, from October 22, 1959, to July 21, 1960.

As a result of the critical success of his 1957 NBC special Silent Show, Ernie came to Hollywood in 1958, where he had a film contract with Columbia Pictures to write and consult on screenplays – but no television series of his own. At that time, sponsors did not buy commercial time on a television shows as a commodity; rather, a sponsor would produce a television program in its entirety and present it to a network for broadcast. While visiting a Hollywood movie set, Kovacs happened to meet a cigar company executive who was impressed that Kovacs continually smoked a cigar. Ernie was impressed that this corporate executive was carrying a book on Bertold Brecht. As a result of this chance meeting, a business deal ensued in which Consolidated Cigar/Dutch Masters became the sole sponsor of Ernie's newest idea for a television series.Take a Good Look webpage of the Unofficial Ernie Kovacs website In the show itself, Ernie performed in many Dutch Masters commercials, usually presented as yet another type of \\"blackout gag\\" shown during the show and themselves unique due to being done completely in pantomime and directed by Kovacs himself. The Congress of TV Editorial Writers was impressed enough with the silent commercials to award Kovacs with their Madison Avenue Award in 1960. Format Kovacs and Edie Adams share a laugh on the show's set. Kovacs hosted the program while Adams was one of the panelists. Take A Good Look was a parody of the Goodson-Todman panel game shows of the era, To Tell the Truth, I've Got a Secret, and What's My Line?. Kovacs, who appeared on What's My Line? ten times as a guest panelist (July–November 1957) and twice as the show's Mystery Guest (September 6, 1956 and September 7, 1957),What's My Line EPISODE #369 webpage at TV.COM websiteErnie Kovacs credits webpage of the IMDB websiteWhat's My Line EPISODE #375 webpage at TV.COM website produced and hosted a format similar to those shows: a panel of celebrities attempted to guess a secret about a seemingly ordinary person brought onstage. In early episodes, the clues were presented by way of props and short video clips that had no cast, but eventually the show switched to using films of short comedy blackout gags starring Kovacs and a regular cast of Peggy Connelly, Jolene Brand, and Bobby Lauher.Take A Good Look webpage on the Ernie Kovacs Blog website The clips pertained only vaguely to the person about whom guesses were being made. For example, for a woman whose secret was that she was a harness track jockey, Kovacs would show a short skit about two competing chariot racers trying to sabotage each other during a race. Another example was for a champion bubble blower, Kovacs showed a skit regarding a model train set for a movie scene; the sole hint was the sound a train makes, \\"choo-choo\\", and the extreme vagueness of this clue suggests that the skits were meant to be recycled. Some of the people who were the focus of the guessing game were ordinary people who had experienced an extraordinary event, recently been in the news, or enjoyed a distinction of some kind. A panelist would be awarded one point if they guessed the person's identity/secret. At the end of the show, prizes would be awarded to the home viewer represented by the panelist with the most points. Panelists Appearing regularly throughout the run were Edie Adams, Cesar Romero, Hans Conried, and Ben Alexander. Carl Reiner only appeared regularly in Season 2. Among the less frequent panelists of Season 1 were Zsa Zsa Gabor, Jane Wyatt, Mort Sahl, Jack Carson, Tony Randall, Janet Leigh, and Jim Backus. No infrequent panelists appeared in Season 2.

He is known for naval exploits against the pirate Edward England and for reforming the administration of Madras Presidency.  Early life  James Macrae was born in 1677, in Ayrshire, Scotland. Little is known about his ancestry; according to the history of the clan Macrae his paternal grandfather was one John Macrae, also known as Ian Mac Ian Oig Dubh, \\"Black John the young son of John\\". Macrae's father died when he was barely five years old and the family moved to the town of Ayr where they lived in a thatched hut. Macrae's mother found a job as a washerwoman. Macrae did not have any formal education of his own but picked up bits and pieces of knowledge on the world about him. He added his own to the family's meagre earnings by delivering messages. Tired of poverty, Macrae soon ran away from home and sailed to India. James Talboys Wheeler, writes that Macrae was \\"tired of this monotonous life\\" and \\"with the energy he showed then he would have assimilated the passionate desire to embark in commercial ventures of the time\\" More prosaically, Dr. Eric J. Graham, Scottish historian specializing in maritime history, concludes that embarking at sea in 1692, \\"Macrae fled a life close to starvation\\".  Early career  Little is known about the first thirty years of his life. Macrae worked as a seaman in service of the British East India Company and rose to become captain. While functioning as the skipper of the Cassandra, Macrae encountered the fabled pirate Edward England near the Comoros on 17 August 1720. While Robert Kirtby and the Dutch vessel assigned to assist Macrae fled the scene, Macrae single-handedly engaged England. During a naval battle which lasted over three hours, Macrae and his men killed about a hundred of England's pirates who numbered about 500. However, seven more hours later, they faced heavy reverses and were forced to abandon ship. This naval battle was later described by Graham as the \\"bloodiest engagement and killing of pirates along the African coast\\". Macrae enlisted the support of the king of the island and engaged the pirates once more. But injured in his head and with a price upon him set by Edward England, Macrae was forced to escape. Ten days later, however, Macrae surrendered to England and after a heated debate on his fate, the pirates finally pardoned him (which incidentally sealed the fate of England) and left the island on 3 September 1720. Macrae, himself, left five days later arriving at Bombay on 26 October 1720.  Governor of Madras  The East India Company, impressed by the Macrae's abilities appointed him Superintendent in 1723, to investigate and end the chronic corruption that affected the English settlements on the west coast of Sumatra. In 1723, Macrae was appointed Deputy Governor of Fort St David. Macrae showed good administrative acumen as Deputy Governor. As deputy governor, Macrae promoted trade and commerce. On the retirement of the then Governor of Madras Nathaniel Elwick on 15 January 1725, Macrae succeeded to his post. Macrae began an ambitious reform program. It increased the profits of the company, cut spending, and improved the exchange rate between gold and silver. In terms of public health, he launched a study of the city and its surroundings in order to reduce the high mortality rate. As a deviation from the company's general policy of discouraging indigenous trade and industries, Macrae promoted free trade and industry during his tenure. He restored decrepit buildings and strengthened fortifications and promoted the first Protestant mission to the city in 1726. Soon after Macrae became governor, there was a general unrest among the Nizam's soldiers in Visakhapatnam due to the indebtedness of the Nizam prompting fears that the soldiers might invade the city of Madras. Macrae sent a small army which restored order in the city. In December 1726, Macrae commissioned a revenue survey of the city. The houses and people within the limits of the city were enumerated and their castes and occupations recorded. On 24 September 1726, King George I issued a charter giving judicial powers to the Madras city administration. As per the charter, the mayor and aldermen of Madras were made a Court of Record and were authorized to handle civil suits. The Governor of Madras and his council constituted the higher court of appeal. Macrae also exposed the corrupt practises of the Bombay governor Walsh who had tampered with official accounts. Due to this expose, Walsh was recalled and replaced as Governor of Bombay by Robert Cowan. Back in England, Walsh launched several charges against Macrae thereby prompting a detailed investigation. The ensuing scandal compelled Macrae to resign in February 1730. He was succeeded as Governor by George Morton Pitt on 14 May 1730.  Later years  Macrae returned to Great Britain in 1730 and settled in the London suburb of Blackheath. At Blackheath, Macrae researched on his clan McGuire and traced their ancestry to Ayr.http://www.clan- macrae.org.uk/scotland/articles.cfm?ID=92 Macrae, himself, moved to Ayr, a couple of years later. In 1733, he was admitted as a citizen of the city of Ayr. He also financed an equestrian statue to William II of Scotland at Glasgow. In 1736, Macrae purchased a property belonging to Hugh Bailie of Monktown, renaming it Orangefield. He, subsequently, surrendered the barony of Houston in Dumfriesshire. Macrae died in July 1744 and was buried in the cemetery of the church of Monktown. The category A listed Macrae Monument to his memory was erected by John Swan in 1750.

Born in 1802, he joined the French Navy at the age of 16. From 1822 to 1825, he participated in an expedition that explored the South Pacific and, by its conclusion, circumnavigated the world. He disappeared in August 1833, while in command of his own expedition to the Arctic. Early life Jules Poret de Blosseville was born on 29 July 1802 in Rouen, Normandy, the son of a vicomte. He had an older brother who later succeeded to the title. He was well educated with interests in astronomy and zoology. He joined the French Navy in 1818 and, as an officer, joined an expedition to the West Indies aboard the Railleur. In August 1822, Blossville was selected as a midshipman on Louis Duperrey's expedition aboard La Coquille to explore the South Pacific. With Lieutenant Jules Dumont d'Urville, well known for his role in the discovery of the Venus de Milo statue, as second in command, it was intended to sail to several islands in the region, conducting hydrographical and ethnological surveys. Blosseville's berth on La Coquille was due to the influence of his father, who was acquainted with the Minister of the Navy, Duc de Clermont-Tonnerre. Exploring the Pacific The expedition departed Toulon on 10 August 1822, making for South America. After stopping at Brazil and the Falkland Islands, the French rounded Cape Horn on 31 December 1822 and travelled along the coast to Peru, conducting hydrographic surveys. They reached Tahiti in May 1823, anchoring at Matavai Bay where Blosseville started his hydrographical surveying work. While at Tahiti, Blosseville became acquainted with Captain John Dibbs of the colonial barque Endeavour. With Dibbs, he sailed to Maupiti Island to map it for the expedition. While there he collected a bird specimen, the Maupiti Monarch, which was soon to become extinct. The expedition moved onto to Tonga, the Solomon Islands, Timor, and Australia, attained in January 1824. While at Sydney in Australia, Blosseville was invited by Sir Thomas Brisbane, the governor of New South Wales to work in his newly built observatory. They sailed onto New Zealand, arriving in the Bay of Islands in April 1824, where Blosseville undertook surveying work and explored the area inland. During his time in New Zealand, he met the māori chief Hongi Hika and investigated the farming techniques of the colonists. Leaving New Zealand on 17 April 1824, visits to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, and the Carolines followed, including the discovery of the previously unmapped islands of Mokil and Losap before the expedition moved onto the Dutch East Indies. They began their way home in September 1824, reaching Marseilles in March 1825, without having suffered any fatalities during the entire expedition. During the voyage, Duperrey named an island in the Schoutens, near New Guinea, for Blosseville although it is no longer known by this name. Soon after the return of the expedition's return, d'Urville had submitted a proposal to journey around the world to the Minister of the Navy. This being accepted, he invited Blosseville to join him but was met with a refusal. Instead, Blosseville worked on a number of publications; he was a contributor to an atlas of landscapes and portraits, and wrote a report on New Zealand which was published in 1826, first as part of a periodical and then as a separate document. Further reports on the feasibility of a French colony in New Zealand followed, the last of which was published in 1829. He had already returned to sea by this time; in 1827, he had sailed to India and Burma aboard Chevrette as part of a scientific expedition and the following year, promoted to lieutenant, undertook a hydrographic expedition aboard the Alacrity, serving in the Mediterranean. He was present at the invasion of Algiers in 1830. Later life The French brig-of-war Lilloise In 1833, Blosseville submitted a request to undertake an expedition exploring the Arctic, which was duly approved. He departed as commander of Lilloise and made his way to Greenland, where he carried out mapping along the east coast. His ship became damaged and he put into Iceland for repairs. Once this work was completed, he departed back to Greenland. His expedition then disappeared, its last known sighting being made on 15 August 1833. In the following years, three expeditions were mounted to find him and the 83 other men of his command but no trace was found. In January 1846, it was reported that the Lilloise had been wrecked on Vanikoro, in the Solomon Islands. This report was later dismissed as having been made in error, given the last sighting of Lilloise and the supposed location of the wreck. Blosseville is commemorated in the name of the Blosseville Coast, a portion of the southeast coastline of Greenland, from between Kangerlussuaq Fjord and Cape Brewster. His brother, a historian, later wrote a biography of him.

However, only 8 examples of the RNA motif are known. The RNAs are potentially in the 5' untranslated regions of genes related to molybdenum cofactor (Moco), specifically a gene that encodes a molybdenum-binding domain and a nitrate reductase, which uses Moco as a cofactor. Thus the RNA might be involved in the regulation of genes based on Moco levels. Reliable predictions of Moco-II RNAs are restricted to deltaproteobacteria, but a Moco-II RNA might be present in a betaproteobacterial species. The Moco RNA motif is another RNA that is associated with Moco, and its complex secondary structure and genetic experiments have led to proposals that it is a riboswitch. However, the simpler structure of the Moco-II RNA motif (see diagram) is less typical of riboswitches. Moco-II RNAs are typically followed by a predicted rho- independent transcription terminator.

He attended Provincial Secondary School, Bida from 1956 to 1961 and continued further studies at the School for Arabic Studies, Kano. He earned a degree in English from Abdullahi Bayero College in 1967 and a masters in 1970. He joined Ahmadu Bello University in 1967 as a lecturer of languages. From 1967 to 1976, Ibrahim moved up within the administrative ranks, he was acting registrar of Bayero University Kano and Executive Secretary of the Center for Cultural Studies between 1973 and 1975. When Niger State was created in 1976, his services was transferred to the new state as an administrator. He was initially acting Permanent Secretary for Special Duties before becoming the Permanent Secretary for Local Government. Governor In 1979, he left civil service to contest for as a candidate for Governor of Niger State under the National Party of Nigeria. Ibrahim won the primary and defeated in challenges in the gubernatorial states elections to become the first elected Governor of Niger State. There were attempts to impeach Ibrahim while he was governor. He was forced out of office after the coup that brought General Muhammadu Buhari to power. A military tribunal set up by the Buhari government convicted him of abuse of power and corruption 1984. In 1986 he was barred for life from holding public office or participating in partisan politics. Emir of Suleja The Suleja Emirate is a Hausa emirate established in the early 19th century, formerly called Abuja, in what is now Niger State. In 1976 a large part of the emirate plus territory from other states became the Federal Capital Territory, centered on the new city of Abuja. The emirate was renamed Suleja, based on the renamed town of Suleja which remained in Niger State. Awwal Ibrahim became the Emir, or Sarki, of Suleja in 1993. His accession resulted in rioting and destruction of property by opponents. He was deposed on 10 May 1994 by General Sani Abacha. After the return to democracy, Awwal Ibrahim was restored to his title of Emir of Suleja on 17 January 2000. His restoration again caused a series of violent clashes, forcing the government to call in anti-riot troopers and impose a 20-hour curfew. Twenty one people were arrested including the chairman of the Suleja Emirate, Alhaji Shuaibu Barda. Speaking at Awwal Ibrahim's palace in June 2008, Niger State governor Muazu Babangida Aliyu noted the environmental and social problems that expansion of the federal capital has caused to the ancient city of Suleja and called for federal funding to accelerate development. In September 2001, Ibrahim was awarded the title of Commander of the Niger. In 2010 he was chairman of the Niger State government's Committee on Reformation of Almajirci.

Biography =Youth and conversion= Sheffey was born near the hamlet of Ivanhoe, Wythe County, Virginia, of a locally prominent family, the youngest of five brothers.Barbery, 29–33. The second oldest, James White Sheffey, became a lawyer, a state legislator, and perhaps the largest landowner in southwest Virginia. Another brother, Hugh Sheffey attended Yale and represented Augusta County in the legislature. A third, Lawrence, became a physician. Robert Sheffey \\"made it a custom to eat his birthday dinner every Fourth of July in the house of his birth.\\" Richmond Times, September 9, 1902, 2. His mother died when he was two, and he was reared by an aunt in Abingdon, Virginia. Sheffey attended Emory and Henry College in 1839–40, but “his early dislike for books and an aversion for profound study” did not augur well for higher education.Barbery, 37. Jess Carr, who wrote a fictionalized biography of Sheffey, said in a published diary about his writing process that although Sheffey was not stupid, \\"he just never got himself in intellectual gear.\\" Jess Carr, Birth of a Book: A Diary of the Day-to-Day Writing of The Saint in the Wilderness (Radford, Virginia: Commonwealth Press, 1974), 36. Sheffey was eighteen when he was converted at a revival in Abingdon.Sheffey said he was “born of the flesh on July 4, 1820, in Ivanhoe, Wythe County, Virginia, and that he was born of the Spirit on January 9, 1839, over Greenway’s store, at Abingdon, Virginia.” Quoted in Barbery, 57. Although his relatives wished him to continue in the Presbyterian church, he became a Methodist and, shortly thereafter, an itinerant preacher.Barbery, 38–39. Sheffey wrote that he left his relatives “and never went back there any more for 14 years, and when I did go back they were dead. I can’t say that they died in consideration of me, but they are gone.” =Marriages and family= In 1843, Sheffey married Elizabeth Zwecker, and they had six children.Barbery, 36; FamilySearch.org. Carr believed Zwecker was a \\"withdrawn, complicated, and perhaps deeply unhappy person\\" but that Sheffey loved her \\"very deeply.\\" Carr, Birth, 41. Sheffey farmed, taught school, served as a clerk, and kept a store.Barbery, 45. Sheffey wrote that he was also capable of cooking, milking, churning, washing, ironing, making clothing, making up beds, and sweeping but that he could not \\"starch as well as the splendid starchers in the North or East.\\" (45–46) After the death of his first wife in 1854, he became completely committed to his ministry, and legends began to grow about his “peculiarities, idiosyncrasies, his pet hobbies, and his odd whimsical notions.”Barbery, 39. A nephew called him \\"one of the most singularly eccentric men I have ever known....He does not belong to the conference but goes about preaching on his own hook and is never satisfied until he gets up a tremendous shout.\\" James I. Robertson, ed., Soldier of Southwestern Virginia: The Civil War Letters of Captain John Preston Sheffey (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2004), 191. For several years he attempted to obtain a license to preach but because of his oddities did not succeed until 1855.Barbery, 83. Yet eventually his circuit of Methodist churches spanned fourteen mountain counties in Virginia and West Virginia and included regular appearances at the popular Wabash Camp Meetings near Staffordsville, Giles County, Virginia.\\"Discover History and Heritage, 1875 to 1900,\\" Roanoke Times, August 2015, 52; Barbery, 63, 88. In January 1864 Sheffey married Elizabeth “Eliza” Stafford, although her parents did not favor the marriage because of Sheffey's constant circuit riding. Nevertheless, the marriage was a success.Shortly after the marriage, his nephew wrote that Sheffey had told him \\"with much gusto of his marriage...and of his perfect happiness.\\" Robertson, 191. Eliza understood her husband and did not complain about his frequent absences.FamilySearch.org; Barbery, 47–48. “Sometimes he would ride up to his house and without dismounting call his wife out and talk with her like two children who are infatuated with each other. His greetings were quite brief, and then he would say to his wife, ‘Eliza, I have to hurry; I must be at my next appointment.’” (51). The couple had one son, Edward Fleming Sheffey (1865–1933), who became a successful Lynchburg businessman. He remembered as a boy telling his father, “Uncle Johnny thinks that you ought to spend more time with your family,” to which Sheffey replied, “Son, Uncle Johnny doesn’t know which way the rats run. The Lord will take care of you.” Eventually even the Staffords were reconciled to the marriage.Barbery, 48. =\\"St. Francis of the wilderness\\"= Called a “St. Francis of the wilderness,” Jess Carr, The Saint of the Wilderness: A Biographical Novel Depicting the Life and Works of Robert Sayers Sheffey (Radford, VA: Commonwealth Press, Inc., 1974), xiii. Sheffey was renowned for his concern about the welfare of animals. He once dismounted to collect tadpoles in his handkerchief so that he could transfer them to a stream from a small pool where they were certain to die. Others he tried to save by bringing water to their mud hole. Sheffey regularly stopped to right beetles and dropped out of funeral processions to lift insects out of the way of wagon wheels. He gave his lunch to hungry dogs and tried (unsuccessfully) to “relieve” flies caught on sticky paper. Once when his brother-in-law cut a wasp in two with a pair of scissors, Sheffey went out to the yard and starting praying. When the brother-in-law asked why, he replied, “I am praying for the Lord to make another wasp to take the place of the one you killed.” Barbery, 67, 74, 68, 132, 72. Sheffey was especially solicitous of his horse. He specifically instructed hosts how to water and feed his horse, and he often dismounted rather than make the horse carry him up a steep grade.Barbery, 134. Sheffey had a sweet tooth and would often fill his mouth with sugar, honey, or maple syrup. He regularly prayed, “Lord, bless the little honeybees for they make sweet honey. Like sweet Jesus.”Barbery, 61, 89, 94, 97, 110. On one occasion “he took two tablespoons of sugar in his hands and filled his mouth with it as he went into the yard. He sat down among the people and his first audible words were ‘sweet Jesus.’ Then he began to talk with them about the deep things of life, and before the throng had dispersed they were seen to be weeping on every side.” (61). Methodist preacher Bob Shuler, who knew Sheffey in his youth, claimed Sheffey had hugged sugar maple trees while praising God for honey. Robert Shuler III, Fighting Bob Shuler of Los Angeles (Indianapolis: Dog Ear Publishing, 2012), 21. He was as solicitous of the welfare of men as of animals. On a number of occasions he gave away woolen socks to those who were in need, sometimes giving away a new knitted pair, sometimes taking the socks off his own feet.Barbery, 65–66, 86, 122. Once on a cold day riding the trail, he met a stranger with no coat and gave away his own.Barbery, 100. He even once gave away his horse to replace an animal that had died pulling a heavily loaded covered wagon.Barbery, 117. After being beaten by some young toughs after a meeting, Sheffey tried hard not to testify against them in court, and when they were convicted, with tears he pleaded with the judge to allow them to go unpunished because he had forgiven them.Barbery, 82–83. Sheffey enjoyed singing and shouting and would often draw pictures of birds and fish or write snatches of hymns on the walls of his hosts’ homes or on rock outcroppings, sometimes in artistic lettering.Barbery, 65, 110, 125; Jess Carr, Birth of a Book: A Diary of the Day-to-Day Writing of The Saint in the Wilderness (Radford, Virginia: Commonwealth Press, 1974), 12. \\"In the various homes he stayed in during his journeys, he would often draw on the bedpost of his bed; or if he saw a knothole in a board in the wall or ceiling, he would add some unique sketches to make more artistic the hole.\\" One story claims that after having written “What shall I do to be saved?” on a large rock, he discovered that a patent medicine salesman had written underneath, “Use Hite’s Pain Cure.” Sheffey then added, “And prepare to meet thy God.”Barbery, 91. Sheffey's peculiar sense of humor is also evident in a story about a child bitten by a rattlesnake. Called in to pray for the child, Sheffey is said to have petitioned, “O Lord, we do thank Thee for rattlesnakes. If it had not been for a rattlesnake they would never have called upon You. Send a rattlesnake to bite Bill, and one to bite John, and send a great big one to bite the old man.”Barbery, 68. Even stranger to mountain folk was Sheffey's insistence on cleanliness. If his towels or bedding were dirty, he would let his host know. He might even ask his hostess for a white counterpane. He would pour a small amount of coffee into his saucer, wash the edges where the fingers of his hostess had touched it, and then throw the liquid out the door or into the fire. He assured his son that “plenty of water inside and out” was the “best thing for anybody.”Barbery, 41, 88, 93; Carr, Birth, 45. =Power in prayer= Many stories about Sheffey related to his power in prayer.In an obituary notice, a Richmond newspaper noted that in his section of the state, large numbers of people believed \\"implicitly that he had the power to bring direct and literal answers to prayers.\\" Richmond Times, September 9, 1902, 2. Terri L. Fisher, Pearisburg and Giles County (Arcadia Publishing, 2008), 49: \\"The power of Sheffey's prayers became legend with stories of healing and other miracles.\\" Some of his prayers concerned critical needs of agricultural communities, such as the need for rain in time of drought or the prevention of rain during harvest.Barbery, 72, 99–100, 108–09. Because Sheffey hated the liquor traffic,Charles Chilton Pearson and James Edwin Hendrichs, Liquor and Anti-Liquor in Virginia, 1619–1919 (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1967), 169. his most remembered prayers were directed against stills and the people who ran them. According to an expert in the folklore of itinerant Methodist preachers, there are \\"at least twenty-five accounts of how Sheffey's prayers led to the immediate destruction of whiskey stills and distilleries,\\" many apparently versions of the same episode.Donald E. Byrne, Jr., No Foot of Land: Folklore of American Methodist Itinerants (Metuchen,NJ: Scarecrow Press & American Theological Library Association, 1975), 17. (The owners were not moonshiners; at the time, private distilling was perfectly legal.) According to one minister, Sheffey prayed for the destruction of three distilleries on a creek near where they had been preaching. The minister claimed the proprietor of one still, in robust health, died suddenly; at a second, Sheffey prayed that a tree would fall on the still house though there were no trees nearby, and a “great storm came and actually landed a tree on the still”; and a third still was destroyed by fire after Sheffey had spent a night in prayer against it.Barbery, 83–84; see also, 85, 91, 94, 107, 114. A county historian repeated one of these stories, noting that Sheffey had \\"asked the Lord to destroy Harmon's [still] by letting a tree fall on it,\\" and a dead tree struck by lightning fell on it, setting it afire. Goodrich Wilson, Smyth County History and Traditions (Kingsport Press, 1932), 359–60. Wilson said that Sheffey had suggested to God that a still on White Oak Branch might be destroyed by a flood; and during a storm, the stream rose to unprecedented heights and wiped it out. Men were said to have left the area rather than become the object of Sheffey's prayers.Barbery, 107, 118–19. Benjamin Floyd Nuckolls, Pioneer Settlers of Grayson County, Virginia (Bristol, TN: King Printing Company, 1914), 71: \\"The wicked trembled when he prayed for justice to be meted out to wrongdoers.\\" See also Roger V. Morrison, \\"Review of Mary Ann Hinsdale, et. al., It Comes from the People (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1995),\\" Appalachian Journal 23 (Winter 1996), 202. Sheffey's contemporaries agreed that although “he was the most powerful man in prayer…he couldn’t preach a lick.” He would take a text and never return to it, and his preaching consisted largely of relating personal experiences.Barbery, 58, 89. Nevertheless, as the Methodist preacher George C. Rankin recalled in his memoirs, although Sheffey “acted more like a crazy man than otherwise,” he “was wonderful in a meeting. He would stir the people, crowd the mourner’s bench with crying penitents and have genuine conversions by the score.”George C. Rankin, The Story of My Life (Nashville: Smith, 1912), 241–42. Rankin said Sheffey was \\"recognized all over Southwest Virginia as the most eccentric preacher of that country. He was a local preacher; crude, illiterate, queer and the oddest specimen known among preachers. But he was saintly in his life, devout in his experience and a man of unbounded faith. He wandered hither and thither over that section attending meetings, holding revivals and living among the people. He was great in prayer, and Cripple Creek campground was not complete without \\"Bob\\" Sheffy. They wanted him there to pray and work in the altar. He was wonderful with penitents. And he was great in following up the sermon with his exhortations and appeals. He would sometimes spend nearly the whole night in the straw with mourners; and now and then if the meeting lagged he would go out on the mountain and spend the entire night in prayer, and the next morning he would come rushing into the service with his face all aglow shouting at the top of his voice. And then the meeting always broke loose with a floodtide. He could say the oddest things, hold the most unique interviews with God, break forth in the most unexpected spasms of praise, use the homeliest illustrations, do the funniest things and go through with the most grotesque performances of any man born of woman. It was just 'Bob' Sheffy, and nobody thought anything of what he did and said, except to let him have his own way and do exactly as he pleased. In anybody else it would not have been tolerated for a moment. In fact, he acted more like a crazy man than otherwise, but he was wonderful in a meeting. He would stir the people, crowd the mourner's bench with crying penitents and have genuine conversions by the score. I doubt if any man in all that conference has as many souls to his credit in the Lamb's Book of Life as old 'Bob' Sheffy.\\" =Final years= Eliza Sheffey died in September 1896.Barbery, 48, 136; Carr, Birth, 103. Sheffey continued his ministry as he was physically able, but he eventually suffered intensely from rheumatism. Invited by his son to join him in Lynchburg, Sheffey preferred to stay away from cities and remain in rural Giles County. He died at the home of a friend, Aurelius Vest, a farmer, coffin builder, and country undertaker, near White Gate on August 30, 1902. He is buried in Wesley Chapel Cemetery (off Sheffey Memorial Road) in Trigg. On his monument are the words, \\"The poor were sorry when he died.\\" The Sheffey legend After Sheffey's death, his son, Edward, expressed an interest in writing (or in having written) a biography of his father. However, Edward died before any work was done.Barbery, 8. In 1935, Willard Sanders Barbery, a Methodist minister in Bluefield, Virginia compiled a book of stories he had collected about Sheffey,Barbery’s book does not seem to have been copyrighted, and it is not cataloged by the Library of Congress. which a scholar of religion has called an unusual work \\"published in orthodoxy's hinterlands which gives full play to the tenets of folk religion,\\" a pseudo-biography based on oral sources that indicate \\"the tenacity of the folk memory as well as its appropriation of what orthodoxy would regard as unedifying if not heretical.\\"Donald E. Byrne, Jr., No Foot of Land: Folklore of American Methodist Itinerants (Metuchen,NJ: Scarecrow Press & American Theological Library Association, 1975), 14–16. In 1974, Jess Carr (1930–1990), published a “biographical novel,\\" a project, he said, that had partially been inspired by seeing what he assumed was a funeral being conducted in the Wesley Chapel Cemetery but which a local storekeeper assured him was regular visitation to Sheffey's grave, “all the time, year-round.”Carr, ix–x. Jess Carr, Birth of a Book: A Diary of the Day-to-Day Writing of The Saint in the Wilderness (Radford, Virginia: Commonwealth Press, 1974). A Virginia state historical marker has been placed near the grave, Virginia Department of Historic Resources website: \\"Mountain Evangelist KG-15 The Reverend Robert Sayers Sheffey (1820–1902), although one of a kind as to style and personality, was a Methodist Circuit Rider in the classic frontier tradition. Celebrated for the intensity of his faith and prayer, as well as for his eccentricities, Sheffey's authority was recognized throughout this region. He is buried nearby, in Wesley Chapel Cemetery, beside his second wife, Elizabeth Stafford Sheffey.\\" and in 1979 a Sheffey Memorial Camp Meeting was organized that met annually in Trigg into the 21st century.Fisher, 49; New River Valley News In 1977, Unusual Films, the cinema division of Bob Jones University, released a feature-length film, Sheffey, with a script based on Carr's novel.Unusual Films souvenir book, 1978, BJU Archives. Katherine Stenholm directed a crew of 76 and a cast of about 800, and the film includes a musical score by Dwight Gustafson. A large camp meeting scene was filmed at the nineteenth-century Epworth Camp Meeting in Greenwood, South Carolina, and other scenes were shot at Cades Cove and the Pioneer Farmstead in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the Zebulon Vance birthplace, the \\"Cradle of Forestry,\\" Pleasant Hill, Kentucky (Shakertown), Walnut Grove Plantation, and on location at other sites in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.

Administratively it belongs to the Sermersooq Municipality. The Blosseville Coast is steep and difficult to access by ship owing to the great number of ice floes, frequent fog, dangerous currents and lack of good anchorages. History This stretch of coast is named after French Lieutenant Jules de Blosseville, commander of \\"La Lilloise\\". In 1833 Lt. Blosseville first sighted the stretch of unexplored coast between the 68th and the 69th parallel north. He decided to survey the coast more thoroughly and sailed first to Iceland to make repairs on his ship. Then he headed back to the area of this coast but was lost without a trace. In the years that followed, three expeditions were organized to find Lt. Blosseville and the 83 other men on the ship but no trace was found.Mills, William (2003).

Much like other forms of capital (social, economic, cultural), academic capital doesn't depend on one sole factor—the measured duration of schooling—but instead is made up of many different factors, including the individual's academic transmission from his/her family, status of the academic institutions attended, and publications produced by the individual. History Academic capital originated in 1979 when Pierre Bourdieu (1930–2002), a prominent French sociologist, used the term in his book Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste (translated to English in 1984).Bourdieu, Pierre. (1979) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste. The book attempts to show how individuals are not defined by social class, but instead by their \\"social space,\\" which is dependent on each type of capital the individual has. He explained: “Academic capital is in fact the guaranteed product of the combined effects of cultural transmission by the family and cultural transmission by the school (the efficiency of which depends on the amount of cultural capital directly inherited from the family)” (23). While Bourdieu discussed social capital, economic capital, and cultural capital at length, he did not explore academic capital in equal detail. His 1986 essay, “The Forms of Capital” does not refer to academic capital as one of the main types of capital that affects the success of individuals; therefore he does not see academic capital as being as important as other kinds.Bourdieu, P. (1986) “The forms of capital.” In J. Richardson (Ed.) Handbook of Theory and Research for the Sociology of Education (New York, Greenwood), 241-258. Since Bourdieu first coined the term, it has been used widely—from France, the United States, Australia and Sweden—to discuss many of the implications involved with schooling and the rise of individuals in academia. Numerous studies have been done involving the idea of academic capital, and scholars have disagreed on what counts as academic capital. Bourdieu’s definition of the term is applicable to any individual: even an individual interviewing for a secretarial position would benefit from having more schooling than another candidate. However, it seems that most references to academic capital refer solely to professional teachers and researchers within higher education. For example, in 2009, Michael Burawoy defined academic capital as being estimated from an individual’s curriculum vitae,Burawoy, Michael. “The Public Sociology Wars.” Ed. Jeffries, Vincent. Handbook of Public Sociology. UK: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc. 2009. 449-470. but admitted that it was subjective because some fields of study seem to value certain academic qualities more than others—research, in psychology or study abroad, for scholars in linguistics. Academic capital is not to be confused with other terms that sound familiar—academic capitalism, intellectual capital. Intellectual capital is a business term for the collective knowledge in an organization, considered a capital cost. Academic capitalism is when universities act like profit-seeking organizations that market the knowledge that they can give to students, or clients. Measurement While there is not one specific way to measure academic capital, researchers throughout the world have enacted studies that quantify an individual's academic capital. Some of the ways researchers have attempted to measure academic capital are through: * Years of schooling * Number of publicationsEddy, Matthew. “Academic Capital, Postgraduate Research and British Universities.” Discourse 6.1: 211-223. * Amount of teaching experience * Strength of an individual's professional network * Number of academic exchanges (like Fulbright fellowships)Prejmerean, Mihaela Cornelia and Simona Vasilache. \\"A Three Way Analysis of the Academic Capital of a Romanian University.\\" Journal of Applied Quantitative Methods: 3:2 (2008): 129-138. http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/3e/63/95.pdf * Research experience Effect On an individual level, academic capital influences and informs several important aspects of life. In the most basic sense, academic capital is strongly tied to earning potential. Individuals with only a high school diploma, on average, make over $20,000 less annually than individuals with an undergraduate degree, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For individuals who do not have a high school degree, opportunities for monetary earning fall below $30,000 less than those with a degree.United States. Dept. of Labor. Annual Income for Individuals at Differing Education Levels. Washington: GPO, 2004. Whereas the biggest stepping stone to attain a higher paying career used to be an undergraduate degree, the common discussion in today’s market is the devalued status of a Bachelor’s degree. A Bachelor’s degree no longer holds the same academic capital it used to, and holding such a degree no longer entitles one to the same job opportunities and income possibilities it used to. Government statistics reveal that over the past 8 years, the average weekly earnings of individuals with bachelor's degrees have actually decreased, in relation to inflation, by nearly 2%.IP, Greg. “The Declining Value of Your College Degree.” The Wall Street Journal. 17 July 2008. Therefore, many individuals are studying beyond four-year institutions in order to increase their capital and ultimately their income. When compared to an individual with a bachelor's degree, an individual with a graduate degree makes, on average, nearly $75,000 more annually. In broader terms, a person’s academic capital affects his or her career opportunities and ultimately his or her career decisions. Again, with the diminished status of an undergraduate degree, individuals need to attend further schooling in order to increase their academic capital and their opportunities in the job market. Academic capital doesn't influence only one's final career choice, but also influences a person’s social standing and clout. Holding a doctoral degree or graduate degree earns a person a certain social esteem that those with only a high school diploma often do not receive. It also affects a person’s social networking, as those with higher education have had access and exposure to others following similar paths. It will affect where a person lives (due both to financial opportunities and social networking) and, ultimately, where his or her children go to school, creating a cyclical, interwoven relationship between schooling and social status. An individual's academic capital does not affect only their own personal life, but also the lives of those around them, like their children or, in the case of teachers, their students. Several studies suggest that a teacher’s qualifications and academic capital have a direct relationship with their students’ success. What makes this issue of great concern is that teachers with high levels of academic capital are not distributed evenly throughout the population. According to the Illinois Education Research Council, as levels of poverty and minority populations increase within a school, the number of teachers with high academic capital strongly decrease. Just the reverse was true in school systems with low levels of poverty and minority students—at such schools, the number of teachers with high academic capital strongly outnumbered the teachers with a low academic capital as much as 40 to 1.DeAngelis, Karen, Jennifer Presley and Brad White. “Teacher Academic Capital in Illinois, 2001-2006: Closing the Gap?” Illinois Education Research Council. San Diego, CA: April 15, 2009.< > Since there is a direct correlation between a teacher’s academic capital and his or her students’ success, it is concerning to consider that students who find themselves in low income, high minority schools will not have the same opportunity to grow and expand their own academic capital as would similar students at an institute with lower poverty and minority rates. The Illinois Education Research Council acknowledges that academic capital is only one of the many things that constitute a teacher's success in the classroom; however, its report refers to a study that used student value-added data to determine a direct link between a student’s progress and his or her teacher’s academic capital. A similar study done in the state of Texas came to comparable conclusions that the skill level of a teacher informs the students’ success.Alexander, Celeste, and Ed Fuller. “Effects of Teacher Qualifications.” American Educational Research Association. Canada, April 2005. <> While much of the discussion focuses on the general lack of qualifications held by some current educators in the system, the overarching theme is that the higher the qualifications and skill set, the better the outcome for the student. As much as a teacher has a role in a child's development and ability to acquire the academic capital that will prepare him or her for further education, the role of the parent cannot be overlooked. The parents, to begin with, set the child up for the type of education he/she will receive early in life. The family’s economic background and locale will determine the type of school the child attends, therefore influencing the teachers the child will have, and ultimately informing the opportunity for academic capital. Aside from that, the culture of the family, what the family values and respects, will inform a child’s decision to attend higher education as opposed to joining the work force or pursuing alternate paths. Even if children do manage to step outside their family name and expectations, their family can still influence their academic capital. A child whose father attended an Ivy league school, for example, may still have more social clout than he would ordinarily have even if he himself did not attend college. Similarly, an individual from a working-class family, a first generation college student, may not attain full academic capital due to his familial association. Relation with cultural capital Bourdieu argues that academic capital is affected by cultural capital, and vice versa. If one has a high degree of schooling, then it is likely that he or she will have more cultural capital—perhaps skills in painting or music—because he or she has been in the education system longer. Similarly, those individuals who do not value education would not likely value the cultural practices that education enforces, like visiting museums or attending drama performances. In a study done by Javier Rojas regarding cultural capital and academic achievement in Mexico, by looking at the academic level and the participation in cultural activities (art gallery, opera, museum, symphony, etc.) of fifteen-year-olds in Mexico, the amount of cultural intake was directly proportional to the level of academic achievement in the students.Rojas, Javier. \\"Cultural Capital and Academic Achievement in Mexico\\" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, Marriott Hotel, Loews Philadelphia Hotel, Philadelphia, PA, Aug 12, 2005 . 2009-05-25 http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p23090_index.html However, it has been argued (Sullivan, A. 2007, Crook, C. 1997) that Bourdieu’s research on the different types of capital does not actually explain a relationship; rather that it simply demonstrates a cycle.Sullivan, Alice. “Cultural Capital, Cultural Knowledge and Ability.” Sociological Research Online 12:6 (2007). . 24 March 2010.Crook, Christopher J. Cultural Practices and Socioeconomic Attainment: the Australian Experience. California: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. Further opinions The definition and effects of academic capital have been widely contested for a variety of reasons. While Bourdieu initially claims that academic capital is simply measured by the duration of schooling, other studies have posited that factors such as family and social capital, as well as culture, affect academic capital. Keith Roe argues that academic capital is more than the duration of schooling. He states that “students from privileged backgrounds may squander their cultural inheritance and some students from less privileged backgrounds are able to overcome their cultural disadvantages as a result of exceptional ability and certain features of their family background.” Roe, Keith. \\"Academic Capital and Music Tastes among Swedish Adolescents.\\" The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Web. 23 March 2010. . This idea contrasts the notion that duration is the only measure of academic capital, since a student may go to four-year university while another goes to two-year junior college, but if the four-year student isn't invested in academics he doesn't utilize the capital. Roe believes that academic capital is the “guaranteed product of the interaction of cultural transmission by the family and by the school.” He explains that factors like economic and cultural capital affect the accumulation and retention of academic capital. Roe finds that social class influences the acquisition of academic capital: “A general opposition is found within each social class between the fractions richest in cultural capital and poorest in economic capital and those richest in economic capital and poorest in cultural capital. Those who have acquired the bulk of their cultural capital in and for school are found to have more 'classical', safer, cultural investments than those who have received a large cultural inheritance.” Therefore, economic capital and cultural capital have the ability to influence the type of academic capital that one accrues both within schools and at home. The fact that people who gain most of their cultural capital in schools are considered to have more legitimate tastes and preferences makes it seem like they have more academic capital in some cases. In her dissertation \\"The Effects of Secondary School Climate on Students' Academic Success,\\" Margaret Johansson explores the idea that “connectedness to the school community of teachers and peers … allows the student to use the social capital of the school to maximize education gains.” Johansson, Margaret. \\"The Effects of Secondary School Climate on Students'academic Success.\\" Diss. Columbia University, 2003. Abstract. (2003). ProQuest. Web. 23 March 2010. . It also addresses the “moderating effect of the parent- adolescent relationship on the link between school climate and academic outcomes,” which relates to the idea that academic capital isn't just measured by the duration of schooling, but also the quality. Johansson addresses the idea that “family social capital and school social capital [are] determinants of secondary school success.” Two students who attend similar four-year colleges should have the same amount of social capital if duration of schooling is the only determinant, but it has been noted that students from certain social and cultural groups gain more academic capital than their peers. Kevin Marjoribanks, a preeminent scholar in the international education community over several decades, argues that “family background, childhood social and academic capital, and adolescents' social capital combine to have medium to large associations with adolescents' aspirations.” Marjoribanks, Kevin. \\"Family Background, Social and Academic Capital, and Adolescents' Aspirations: A Mediational Analysis.\\" Social Psychology of Education 2.2 (1997): 177-97. Springer Link. Springer Netherlands. Web. 23 March 2010. . He also indicates that “within encompassing family backgrounds, differences in educational outcomes should be examined in relation to children's and parents' perceptions of social and cultural capital and to variations in children's academic capital.” His analysis strengthens the argument that the duration of schooling (coupled with its quality) and family and social environments affect aspirations and success. Some have even argued that society's strong emphasis on gaining academic capital may be a cause of the high rates of cheating and plagiarism in schools. Since gaining academic capital may be the one way for those in academia to move up in their field, greater stress is placed on this form of capital, and therefore pressure can arise to do better than a scholar thinks he or she is capable of, leading them to cheat or plagiarize.Gallant, Tricia Bertram. “21st Century Forces Shaping Academic Integrity.” ASHE Higher Education Report: 3:5 (2008): 65-78.

Principle eWLB eWLB is a further development of the classical Wafer Level Ball Grid Array Technology (WLB or WLP: wafer level package). The main driving force behind the eWLB technology was to allow fanout and more space for interconnect routing. All process steps for the generation of the package are performed on the wafer. This allows, in comparison to classical packaging technologies (e. g. ball grid array), the generation of very small and flat packages with excellent electrical and thermal performance at lowest cost. It is common for all WLB technologies, which are built on a silicon wafer, that the interconnects (typically solder balls) fit on the chip (so called fan-in design). Therefore only chips with a restricted number of interconnects can be packaged. Cross Section eWLB The eWLB technology allows the realization of chips with a high number of interconnects. The package is not created on a silicon wafer as for the classical Wafer Level Package, but on an artificial wafer. Therefore a front-end-processed wafer is diced and the singulated chips are placed on a carrier. The distance between the chips can be chosen freely, but it is typically larger than on the silicon wafer. The gaps and the edges around the chips are now filled with a casting compound to form a wafer. After curing an artificial wafer containing a mold frame around the dies for carrying additional interconnect elements is created. After the build of the artificial wafer (the so-called Reconstitution) the electrical connections from the chip pads to the interconnects are made in thin-film technology, as for any other classical Wafer Level Package. With this technology any number of additional interconnects can be realized on the package in an arbitrary distance (fan-out design). Therefore, this Wafer Level Packaging Technology can also be used for space sensitive applications, where the chip area wouldn’t be sufficient to place the required number of interconnects at a suitable distance. The eWLB Technology was developed by Infineon, STMicroelectronics and STATS ChipPAC Ltd.Infineon, ST and STATS Develops eWLB  TopNews United States First components were brought into market mid of 2009 (mobile phone).

Biography Steffanie is the daughter of Hawaiian jazz singer Jimmy Borges and Japanese Shizuko Yagi and she went to live in Honolulu, Hawaii soon after her birth. She began her working career in Japan as a model for advertising and TV campaigns. Borges started her singing career recording two singles in between 1977 and 1978 and an album of pop songs in 1978. In 1982, with the name Stevany she sang the theme for the soundtrack of the anime movie Andromeda Stories. During the 80s, she changed her image and musical style, switching over to hard rock and melodic heavy metal and producing two new solo albums recorded in Japan, which were released by Warner Japan. While the musicians that recorded the studio albums were all Japanese, the band accompanying her in various Japanese TV shows was composed by American performers, including her cousins Tony and David Borges and her future husband Randy Juergenson. In this period, she also worked on songs for the anime series Urusei Yatsura and for the movie Urusei Yatsura: Remember My Love. After a few auditions in 1991, she replaced singer Keiko Terada within the all-female Japanese metal band Show-Ya, using her full name Steffanie Borges. She remained in the band for six years, performing a highly media covered concert in North Korea in June 1991 and recording with Show-Ya the single \\"Flame of the Angels\\" in 1992 and the album Touch the Sun in 1995. She left the band in 1996 and moved to Los Angeles in the United States with her husband Randy Juergenson, who had worked with her during the recording sessions of Touch the Sun.

To date, the Congotronics series has featured music by bands such as Konono N°1, Kasai Allstars, Sobanza Mimanisa, Kisanzi Congo, Masanka Sankayi and Basokin. These bands play what is referred to in the Congo as tradi-moderne music, and comprise musicians who left the bush in order to settle in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic Of The Congo. In order to continue to fulfill their social role (they play at weddings, funerals and social gatherings) and make themselves heard by their fellow citizens despite the high level of urban noise, they had to resort to a makeshift electrification of their instruments, which provoked a radical mutation of their sound. The much-commented similarities between this music and some forms of avant-rock or electronica is purely fortuitous, since these bands draw exclusively on traditional trance music and have been totally unaware of current Western trends so far. Notable Congotronics bands * Konono N°1 is the band which first introduced electrified traditional Congolese music to broader audiences in North America and Europe. The band was founded in the 1960s by Mingiedi Mawangu, a virtuoso of the likembé (a traditional instrument sometimes called \\"sanza\\", kalimba, mbira or \\"thumb piano\\", consisting of metal rods attached to a resonator). The band's line-up includes three electric likembés (bass, medium and treble), equipped with hand-made microphones built from magnets salvaged from old car parts, and plugged into amplifiers. * Kasai Allstars: A province the size of France situated in the center of Congo, Kasai is well known for its diamond fields and vivid musical traditions. This collective of artists incorporates members from four different Kasaian bands, including Basokin and Masanka Sankayi, and personalities as diverse as singer Muambuyi (from West Kasai), and singer/dancer/slit drum player Tandjolo (from the Tetela region, which links Kasai to the Equator province). * Masanka Sankayi: dancers, singers and story- tellers Muyamba Nyunyi and Kabongo from East Kasai have been together since the 1970s. Muyamba the preacher is also an excellent bass likembe player. Unlike Konono's, his instrument is a 20\\" square box featuring half a likembe on each side and on which he sits in a foetus-like position. * Sobanza Mimanisa (orchestra of light) are the resident band in Nganda Boboto, in the Selembao district. They perform with a limited range of instruments: a bell, a whistle, makeshift percussion, a guitar - whose 'power chord' style is very unusual in Kinshasa - and a likembe playing the bass and solo parts at the same time. Sobanza Mimanisa comes from the Bacongo province. * Kisanzi Congo's line-up is similar to Konono's, and they also come from the Bacongo province (specifically the Mbeko region). But whereas Konono's electric likembes use raw power to carry their message, Kisanzi Congo rely more on virtuosity and adopt a freer form. * Basokin (the Basongye from Kinshasa) are from the Songye region, at the Eastern fringe of Kasai. Their frontman Mputu Ebondo 'Mi Amor' is a well-known spokesman for the Songye and Kasaian community. * Bolia We Ndenge come from the Lake Mai Ndombe. They're remarkable by their central use of the accordion, an instrument which had become very popular in Congo until it was supplanted by the guitar in the '50s. Releases * Congotronics 1 by Konono N°1 (2004) * Congotronics 2 - Buzz'n'Rumble In The Urb'n'Jungle, a multi-artist album comprising a CD and a DVD, and featuring original material by Konono N°1, Basokin, Masanka Sankayi, Kasai Allstars, Bolia We Ndenge, Sobanza Mimanisa, Kisanzi Congo and Tulu (2005) * Live At Couleur Café by Konono N°1 (2007; this album was nominated for a Grammy Award) * In The 7th Moon, The Chief Turned Into A Swimming Fish And Ate The Head Of His Enemy By Magic by Kasai Allstars(2008) * Assume Crash Position by Konono N°1 (2010) * The album Très Très Fort by Staff Benda Bilili is considered as closely related but not strictly part of the Congotronics series. * The Congotronics Vinyl Box Set (2010): in April 2010, Crammed Discs have released a limited edition box set, containing vinyl versions of all the albums listed above (except Konono N°1's Live At Couleur Café, but including the Staff Benda Bilili album and Konono N°1's Assume Crash Position), plus assorted bonuses including a 7\\" single featuring a collaboration between Kasai Allstars and US indie-folk-rock band Akron/Family, as well as videos and mp3s. * Congotronics 5 - Beware the Fetish by Kasai Allstars (2014) External links *The Congotronics mini-site on the Crammed Discs website Category:Album series Category:Democratic Republic of the Congo music ","title":"Congotronics series"},{"id":"26699984","text":"Wolfgang Martini (September 20, 1891 – January 6, 1963) was a Career Officer in the German Air Force, and largely responsible for promoting early radar development and utilization in that country. Early career While attending the Gymnasium in his hometown of Lissa in the Province of Posen, Wolfgang Martini had been a radio enthusiast. Upon graduating in 1910, he joined the Army as a Cadet, and his talents were such that he soon became a Lieutenant and then company commander in a telegraph battalion. During World War I, he had a number of leadership positions in radio operations, being promoted to First Lieutenant and then Captain. At the end of the war, he was the responsible for radio affairs in the Grand Headquarters and commander of the Army Signals School at Namur in occupied Belgium. After the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, Martini was one of the few officers allowed to remain in the Army. For the next five years, he served as a signals instructor at several Army schools, and then from 1924 to 1928, he was the Signals Staff Officer with a District Command. In 1928/1929 he participated in the secret Soviet-German fighter pilot school in Lipetsk in Soviet Russia. Between 1928 and 1933, he was promoted to Major and served as a radio specialist with the Reich Defense Ministry. Lieutenant Colonel to General Upon the formation of the Luftwaffe in 1933, Martini transferred to the new arm and soon became the Chief of the Board of Radio Affairs. He conceived and set up the Luftwaffe Luftnachrichten Abteilung 350, the Air Signals Corps in 1936. In 1938, he was promoted to Major General and named Chief of Signal Affairs of the Luftwaffe. Martini was elevated to General der Luftnachrichtentruppe (en: General of air force communications troops) in 1941, and remained in this position until the end of war in May 1945. Involvement with GEMA and wartime activities In the mid-1930s, the company Gesellschaft für Electroakustische und Mechanische Apparate (GEMA) started the development of a Funkmessgerät (radio indicator), as the British and the Americans did at the same time. The pulse-modulated system was based on earlier work of Dr. Rudolf Kühnhold, a scientist with the Kriegsmarine (German navy), and was done in the greatest secrecy, not even informing the other armed forces of its existence.Kroge, Harry von; GEMA: Birthplace of German Radar and Sonar, translated by Louis Brown, Inst. of Physics Publishing, 2000 GEMA’s product, an early-warning system code named Seetakt, was eventually demonstrated to the Luftwaffe General Staff in November 1938. Martini attended the presentation and immediately realised the military importance of the new technology. He ordered the development of a similar system (ultimately called Freya) for the Luftwaffe, and from this time on was the primary promoter of radar technology in the German High Command. In May and August 1939 he initiated two signals intelligence flights of the LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin along the British East coast to verify suspicions of a British radar equivalent to the German one. However, the British operated their Chain Home early warning radar with different frequencies which the German thought to be outdated and thus the first British operational radar was not detected by the German signals intelligence. Beginning in 1941, in addition to other duties he was named the High Command’s responsible for German radar technology. Although not academically trained his grasp of this technology was intuitive and his involvement was perhaps the greatest impetus to the development of wartime radar in Germany. In most of his activities, Martini reported directly to Hermann Göring, Commander of the Luftwaffe, but Göring never fully trusted him and the two often clashed over technical decisions. For example, as British radar became known to the Germans through Martini’s signals intelligence, they violently disagreed as to its importance. Concerning this, Göring had told other commanders that Martini was a fool, “It was the same with all specialists; they exaggerate the importance of whatever they are working on.”Fisher, David E.; A Summer Bright and Terrible, Shoemaker & Hoard, 2005, pp. 164-168 Post-war activities Following the war, Wolfgang Martini, like other officers at his level, was held in custody by the United States and then the United Kingdom until 1947; however, no charges were ever placed against him. For some time. he was engaged as a consultant to the radio equipment firm of C. Lorenz AG in Stuttgart. Beginning with the formation of the West German armed forces Martini served as a civilian advisor with the new Air Force in 1956, and later with NATO.Prichard, David; The Radar War: Germany’s Pioneering Achievement, Patrick Stephens Ltd.., 1989, p. 219 In late 1944, fearful that records of wartime radar development would be destroyed or lost after the eventual surrender of Germany, General Martini and Dr. Leo Brandt of GEMA had key documents buried in a waterproof metal casket. In the early 1950s, Martini recovered the casket from what was then the Soviet occupied German Democratic Republic. Then, for several years, the recovered documents were published in papers and conferences.Bekker, Cajus; Radar: Duell im Dunkel (Radar: Duel in Darkness), in German, Gerhard Stalling Verlag, 1958 In 1951, Martini was one of the founders of the Committee for Radiolocation Association in Düsseldorf (later becoming the German Society for Positioning and Navigation); much of the information from the buried documents was first released publicly at meetings of this Committee. This helped to overcome the lag in West German research on radar and radio navigation after the war. In these years, Martini established relationships with radar pioneers in several other countries.

Administratively, it is part of the city of Atami, Shizuoka Prefecture, from which it can be reached by ferry. The island is approximately 10 kilometers from the ferry landing in downtown Atami. The island is inhabited, with the population mostly residing on the northern side of the island. As of 2018, the island had a population of 193 people in 114 households. Geology Hatsushima is located within the caldera forming Atami Bay, and was created by an uplift of the seafloor due to volcanic activity. This uplifting has occurred many times in the island's geological history, as evidenced by the many terraces formed by various uplifts. The elevation of the island is above sea level, and the island grew in height approximately two meters as a result of the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. History Hatsushima has been inhabited since prehistoric times, and remains from the Jōmon period have been found in the island's interior. It is mentioned in poetry by Minamoto no Sanetomo during the Kamakura period, and per records dated 1351, the island had 18 households. This grew to 41 households by 1830 during the Edo period. In 1913, the future Emperor of Japan Hirohito visited the island to pursue his hobby of marine biology. The writer Akiko Yosano spent several months on the island in 1923, later publishing a diary of her experiences and comments that the culture of the island retained many traditional aspects which had now vanished from the mainland. Tourist development of the island began in 1964 with efforts by the Fuji Kyuko railway to develop hotels, campgrounds and leisure facilities. In the 1980s, during the Japanese asset price bubble an investment group attempted to overcome the island's objections to selling their land by making them shareholders in a venture company which intended to turn most of the island into a self- contained resort; however, the venture went bankrupt in 1999.

History This picture from the Dublin Penny Journal of 1832, shows how the church originally looked with its spire before the alterations in 1860. On the site where the current church stands, a wooden chapel once existed around the 12th century. It was later demolished and a stone church and Franciscan monastery were built after the arrival in Ireland of the Franciscan order in 1233. In 1235 John le Porter provided the land and King Henry III contributed 50 marks towards the construction.

Identification of this state carries a very grave prognosis for survival; cessation of heartbeat often occurs within a few days although it may continue for weeks if intensive support is maintained.A Code of Practice for the Diagnosis and Confirmation of Death. Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, 70 Wimpole Street, London, 2008 In the United Kingdom, the formal diagnosis of brainstem death by the procedure laid down in the official Code of Practice permits the diagnosis and certification of death on the premise that a person is dead when consciousness and the ability to breathe are permanently lost, regardless of continuing life in the body and parts of the brain, and that death of the brainstem alone is sufficient to produce this state.Criteria for the diagnosis of brain stem death. J Roy Coll Physns of London 1995;29:381–2 This concept of brainstem death is also accepted as grounds for pronouncing death for legal purposes in IndiaThe Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994. Act No.42 of 1994. s. 2 and Trinidad & Tobago.Human Tissue Transplant Act 2000. s. 19(1) Elsewhere in the world the concept upon which the certification of death on neurological grounds is based is that of permanent cessation of all function in all parts of the brain—whole brain death—with which the British concept should not be confused. The United States' President's Council on Bioethics made it clear, for example, in its White Paper of December 2008, that the British concept and clinical criteria are not considered sufficient for the diagnosis of death in the United States of America. Evolution of diagnostic criteria The United Kingdom (UK) criteria were first published by the Conference of Medical Royal Colleges (with advice from the Transplant Advisory Panel) in 1976, as prognostic guidelines.Conference of Medical Royal Colleges and their Faculties in the UK. BMJ 1976;2:1187–8 They were drafted in response to a perceived need for guidance in the management of deeply comatose patients with severe brain damage who were being kept alive by mechanical ventilators but showing no signs of recovery. The Conference sought \\"to establish diagnostic criteria of such rigour that on their fulfilment the mechanical ventilator can be switched off, in the secure knowledge that there is no possible chance of recovery\\". The published criteria—negative responses to bedside tests of some reflexes with pathways through the brainstem and a specified challenge to the brainstem respiratory centre, with caveats about exclusion of endocrine influences, metabolic factors and drug effects—were held to be \\"sufficient to distinguish between those patients who retain the functional capacity to have a chance of even partial recovery and those where no such possibility exists\\". Recognition of that state required the withdrawal of fruitless further artificial support so that death might be allowed to occur, thus \\"sparing relatives from the further emotional trauma of sterile hope\\". In 1979, the Conference of Medical Royal Colleges promulgated its conclusion that identification of the state defined by those same criteria—then thought sufficient for a diagnosis of brain death—\\"means that the patient is dead\\".Conference of Medical Royal Colleges and their Faculties in the UK. BMJ 1979;1:332. Death certification on those criteria has continued in the United Kingdom (where there is no statutory legal definition of death) since that time, particularly for organ transplantation purposes, although the conceptual basis for that use has changed. In 1995, after a review by a Working Group of the Royal College of Physicians of London, the Conference of Medical Royal Colleges formally adopted the \\"more correct\\" term for the syndrome, \\"brainstem death\\"—championed by Pallis in a set of 1982 articles in the British Medical JournalPallis, C. From Brain Death to Brain Stem Death, BMJ, 285, November 1982—and advanced a new definition of human death as the basis for equating this syndrome with the death of the person. The suggested new definition of death was the \\"irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness, combined with irreversible loss of the capacity to breathe\\". It was stated that the irreversible cessation of brainstem function will produce this state and \\"therefore brainstem death is equivalent to the death of the individual\\". Diagnosis In the UK, the formal rules for the diagnosis of brainstem death have undergone only minor modifications since they were first published in 1976. The most recent revision of the UK's Department of Health Code of Practice governing use of that procedure for the diagnosis of death reaffirms the preconditions for its consideration. These are: #There should be no doubt that the patient's condition – deeply comatose, unresponsive and requiring artificial ventilation—is due to irreversible brain damage of known cause. #There should be no evidence that this state is due to depressant drugs. #Primary hypothermia as the cause of unconsciousness must have been excluded, and #Potentially reversible circulatory, metabolic and endocrine disturbances likewise. #Potentially reversible causes of apnoea (dependence on the ventilator), such as muscle relaxants and cervical cord injury, must be excluded. With these pre-conditions satisfied, the definitive criteria are: #Fixed pupils which do not respond to sharp changes in the intensity of incident light. #No corneal reflex. #Absent oculovestibular reflexes – no eye movements following the slow injection of at least 50ml of ice-cold water into each ear in turn (the caloric reflex test). #No response to supraorbital pressure. #No cough reflex to bronchial stimulation or gagging response to pharyngeal stimulation. #No observed respiratory effort in response to disconnection of the ventilator for long enough (typically 5 minutes) to ensure elevation of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide to at least 6.0 kPa (6.5 kPa in patients with chronic carbon dioxide retention). Adequate oxygenation is ensured by pre-oxygenation and diffusion oxygenation during the disconnection (so the brainstem respiratory centre is not challenged by the ultimate, anoxic, drive stimulus). This test—the apnoea test—is dangerous – and may prove lethal.Coimbra CG. The apnea test – a bedside lethal 'disaster' to avoid a legal 'disaster' in the operating room. In Finis Vitae – is brain death still life? pp.113–45Saposnik G et al. Problems associated with the apnea test in the diagnosis of brain death. Neurology India 2004;52:342–45Yingying S et al. Diagnosis of brain death : confirmatory tests after clinical test. Chin Med J 2014;127:1272–77 Two doctors, of specified status and experience, are required to act together to diagnose death on these criteria and the tests must be repeated after \\"a short period of time ... to allow return of the patient's arterial blood gases and baseline parameters to the pre-test state\\". These criteria for the diagnosis of death are not applicable to infants below the age of two months. Prognosis and management With due regard for the cause of the coma, and the rapidity of its onset, testing for the purpose of diagnosing death on brainstem death grounds may be delayed beyond the stage where brainstem reflexes may be absent only temporarily – because the cerebral blood flow is inadequate to support synaptic function although there is still sufficient blood flow to keep brain cells aliveCoimbra CG. Implications of ischemic penumbra for the diagnosis of brain death. Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research 1999;32:1479–87 and capable of recovery.

Extended somatic support for pregnant women after brain death. Crit Care Med 2003;31:1241–49 Criticism The diagnostic criteria were originally published for the purpose of identifying a clinical state associated with a fatal prognosis (see above). The change of use, in the UK, to criteria for the diagnosis of death itself was protested from the first.Evans DW, Lum LC. Cardiac transplantation. Lancet 1980;1:933–4Evans DW, Lum LC. Brain death. Lancet 1980;2:1022 The initial basis for the change of use was the claim that satisfaction of the criteria sufficed for the diagnosis of the death of the brain as a whole, despite the persistence of demonstrable activity in parts of the brain.Evans DW. The demise of 'brain death' in Britain. In Beyond brain death—the case against brain based criteria for human death. Eds. Potts M, Byrne PA, Nilges RG. Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2006, pp. 139–158 In 1995, that claim was abandoned and the diagnosis of death (acceptable for legal purposes in the UK in the context of organ procurement for transplantation) by the specified testing of brainstem functions was based on a new definition of death, viz. the permanent loss of the capacity for consciousness and spontaneous breathing. There are doubts that this concept is generally understood and accepted and that the specified testing is stringent enough to determine that state. It is, however, associated with substantial risk of exacerbating the brain damage and even causing the death of the apparently dying patient so tested (see \\"the apnoea test\\" above). This raises ethical problems which seem not to have been addressed. It has been argued that sound scientific support is lacking for the claim that the specified purely bedside tests have the power to diagnose true and total death of the brainstem, the necessary condition for the assumption of permanent loss of the intrinsically untestable consciousness-arousal function of those elements of the reticular formation which lie within the brainstem (there are elements also within the higher brain). Knowledge of this arousal system is based upon the findings from animal experimentsWard AA. The relationship between the bulbar-reticular suppressor region and the EEG. Clin Neurophysiol 1949;1:120Lindsley DB et al. Effect upon the EEG of acute injury to the brain stem activating system. EEG Clin Neurophysiol 1949;1:475–8627 as illuminated by pathological studies in humans.Parvizi J, Damasio AR. Neuroanatomical correlates of brainstem coma. Brain 2003;126:1524–36 The current neurological consensus is that the arousal of consciousness depends upon reticular components which reside in the midbrain, diencephalon and pons.Textbook of clinical neurology, 2nd Edn. Ed. Goetz CG. Elsevier Science, 2003Bleck TP. In Textbook of clinical neurology, 3rd Edn. Ed. Goetz CG. Elsevier Science, 2007 It is said that the midbrain reticular formation may be viewed as a driving centre for the higher structures, loss of which produces a state in which the cortex appears, on the basis of electroencephalographic (EEG) studies, to be awaiting the command or ability to function. The role of diencephalic (higher brain) involvement is stated to be uncertain and we are reminded that the arousal system is best regarded as a physiological rather than a precise anatomical entity. There should, perhaps, also be a caveat about possible arousal mechanisms involving the first and second cranial nerves (serving sight and smell) which are not tested when diagnosing brainstem death but which were described in cats in 1935 and 1938.G, Magoun HW. Brain stem reticular formation and activation of the EEG. Electroencephalog Clin neurophysiol 1949;1:455–73 In humans, light flashes have been observed to disturb the sleep-like EEG activity persisting after the loss of all brainstem reflexes and of spontaneous respiration.Zwarts MJ, Kornips FHM. Clinical brainstem death with preserved electroencephalographic activity and visual evoked response. Arch Neurol 2001;58:1010 There is also concern about the permanence of consciousness loss, based on studies in cats, dogs and monkeys which recovered consciousness days or weeks after being rendered comatose by brainstem ablation and on human studies of brainstem stroke syndrome raising thoughts about the \\"plasticity\\" of the nervous system. Other theories of consciousness place more stress on the thalamocortical system.Tononi G. An information integration theory of consciousness. BMC Neuroscience 2004;5:42 Perhaps the most objective statement to be made is that consciousness is not currently understood. That being so, proper caution must be exercised in accepting a diagnosis of its permanent loss before all cerebral blood flow has permanently ceased. The ability to breathe spontaneously depends upon functioning elements in the medulla – the 'respiratory centre'. In the UK, establishing a neurological diagnosis of death involves challenging this centre with the strong stimulus offered by an unusually high concentration of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood, but it is not challenged by the more powerful drive stimulus provided by anoxia – although the effect of that ultimate stimulus is sometimes seen after final disconnection of the ventilator in the form of agonal gasps. No testing of testable brain stem functions such as oesophageal and cardiovascular regulation is specified in the UK Code of Practice for the diagnosis of death on neurological grounds. There is published evidenceHall GM et al. Hypothalamic-pituitary function in the 'brain dead' patient. Lancet 1980;2:1259Wetzel RC et al. Hemodynamic responses in brain dead organ donor patients. Anesthesia and Analgesia 1985;64:125–8Pennefather SH, Dark JH, Bullock RE. Haemodynamic responses to surgery in brain-dead organ donors. Anaesthesia 1993;48:1034–38 strongly suggestive of the persistence of brainstem blood pressure control in organ donors. A small minority of medical practitioners working in the UK have argued that neither requirement of the UK Health Department's Code of Practice basis for the equation of brainstem death with death is satisfied by its current diagnostic protocol and that in terms of its ability to diagnose de facto brainstem death it falls far short.

They were signed to Victory Records before deciding not to renew their contract with the label, and have released three full-length albums; Guidebook for Sinners Turned Saints in 2008, They Said a Storm Was Coming in 2010 and Rebel-Revive in 2014. History =Formation and first releases (2005–2008)= The band was formed early in 2005 when brothers Matthew and Anthony Scarpelli (guitar and drums, respectively) began writing songs together. In order to audition for the guitar part, Anthony Carioscia flew over 2,000 miles. He was welcomed into the band, and soon after, they picked up locals Mike Spearman on keyboards and Nick Rodriguez on bass. The five came together under the name Jamie's Elsewhere, the name being derived from an 80's Chicago area venue (which has since burned down) where the Scarpelli's father used to perform. They began writing material for their debut album for year and a half while still looking for a vocalist. Some of the band members attended a party where Chris Paterson, who had ironically missed an original audition due to an automobile accident, happened to be performing. They invited him to join the band, and upon accepting, they entered the studio the very next day with producer Phil Devereux of Deathbot Studios. As a result of the recording session, Jamie's Elsewhere was able to self-release an EP. They toured the west coast for a year in support of the album and sold over 5,000 albums personally. This work ethic drew the attention of Victory Records, and Jamie's Elsewhere was quickly signed to the label at the end of 2007. After hiring Casey Bates (Chiodos, Fear Before) to produce the album, they entered the studio to record their debut album, A Guidebook for Sinners Turned Saints. Matt Scarpelli explained that this title was selected because Patterson's lyrics focused on personal hardships. The album was released in May 2008. Jamies Elsewhere supported up and coming band Eyes Set To Kill on select dates of their \\"Tour of Winter\\" along with Blinded Black Jamies Elsewhere participated on the \\"Nothing But A Ghost Tour along with Four Letter Lie, Our Last Night, There For Tomorrow, and Capital Lights. =Rebuilding and They Said a Storm Was Coming (2009–2010)= After the release of A Guidebook, Paterson, Carioscia, Rodriguez, and Anthony Scarpelli left the band, leaving only Spearman (keyboards) and Matt Scarpelli (guitars) left. In July 2008 before his departure, however, Anthony Scarpelli invited friend and former Audrey is a Narcissist, Protagonist; Antagonist, and Razing Alexandria vocalist Aaron Pauley to try out for the vacant vocalist position. He was invited to join the band, and after finding Scott Daby (drums), Chance Mederios (bass) and Mike Wellnitz (guitar), Jamie's Elsewhere was able to replace all of their former members. In 2009, they wrote all the material for their second album over the course of eight months and recorded it in three weeks. On February 16, 2010, their second album They Said a Storm Was Coming was released. The band hit the road for a few dates of the \\"St. Valentine's Day Massatour\\" supporting Motionless In White, My Hero Is Me, The Hottness, and Of Machines.

They set out on their first headlining tour in support of They Said A Storm Was Coming bringing along Memphis May Fire and I Am Abomination. They then headlined the \\"Westbound And Down\\" Tour along with Scarlett O'Hara, A City Serene, and Casino Madrid. Shortly after, the band jumped on the \\"Tour Fast Tour Furious\\" Tour with headliners Before Their Eyes, along with support from No Bragging Rights, Ice Nine Kills, and To Speak Of Wolves. The band then continued their headling tour in support of their album, with the first leg featuring support from Icon For Hire, and These Hearts, and the second leg featuring Secrets and Life On Repeat. =Line-up instability, leaving Victory Records (2011–2012)= In July 2011, Jamie's Elsewhere amicably parted ways with drummer Scott Daby and rhythm guitarist Mike Wellnitz. Although they have not announced an official replacement for either, they have stated via Facebook that they have been writing and recording material for their untitled follow-up to They Said a Storm Was Coming. In an interview, Aaron Pauley stated that they are hoping for an early 2012 release at the very latest. Pauley also hinted at the possible release of an EP before their new album which would contain acoustic versions of songs from They Said a Storm Was Coming. On August 29, 2011, Jamie's Elsewhere revealed they have left their label, Victory Records, via a press release on their Facebook page. On January 3, 2012, Jamie's Elsewhere announced the release of their new EP entitled Reimagined, which will consist of re-recordings of songs from their 2010 album They Said a Storm Was Coming in a more mellow and acoustic form, rather the band's traditional post- hardcore style. The release date was set for February 14, 2012. In 2012, it was stated that Aaron Pauley would be touring with Of Mice & Men on both vocals and bass. Because Jamie's Elsewhere was touring Japan at the same time, rumors began to spread that Pauley's departure was imminent. Pauley himself has since revealed that he is no longer a member of Jamie's Elsewhere. However, he is still on good terms with the band. It is speculated that Pauley will have a permanent position in Of Mice & Men following the Vans Warped Tour. Justin Kyle, who previously took over vocals during their Japan 2012 tour, announced on November 30 that he is Jamie's Elsewhere's official new vocalist. =Rebel-Revive and Kyle's Departure (2012–2015)= In December 2012, Alternative Press premiered the lyric video for a new Jamie's Elsewhere song titled, \\"A Ghost With an Image\\", which was originally planned for the third album. Along with the new song, it was announced officially that Justin Kyle and Don Vedda had been added as touring vocalist and rhythm guitarist, respectively. On October 12, 2013, Alternative Press premiered the new song, \\"Sick Fiction\\", which featured the debut of the band's new vocalist, Justin Kyle. Justin Kyle and Jamie's Elsewhere went on tour in 2014 but were unable to finish the tour due to \\"various differences.\\" Justin Kyle and Jamie's Elsewhere had not commented on their status until September 3, 2015, when Kyle announced on his Instagram that the band was officially broken up. =Reunion, 'They Said A Storm Was Coming' 10th Anniversary Tour and New Music (2020-Present)= In a Twitter video uploaded to the official Jamie's Elsewhere Twitter account on April 26, 2020, frontman Aaron Pauley announced that the band are working on new music and were planning on a 10th anniversary tour for They Said A Storm Was Coming but due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tour has been pushed back to 2021. Alongside this a new line of merchandise was released. Musical style and lyrical themes The band's musical style during A Guidebook crosses styles of hard rock, pop-punk, post-hardcore, and utilizes auto-tune. The lyrical content focuses on themes of \\"regrets, love, hate, happiness and forgiveness,\\" however, the song titles often do not reflect these themes, as they instead are non sequitur. With the release of They Said a Storm Was Coming, however, the band's sound had shifted radically to a more post-hardcore sound with some metalcore influences. The mix of screaming and singing remained the same as before, but the prominence of the keyboards and synthesizers had been increased drastically. The band's mixture of electronica and post-hardcore influences is often referred to as \\"electronicore.\\" Accompanying these stylistic changes were conceptual changes. With the arrival of new vocalist Aaron Pauley, the song titles more directly reflected the lyrical content contained in each song as opposed to A Guidebook. Lyrically, the album also took a darker approach, and was a concept album written entirely by Pauley after expanding on a dream he had, revolving around a 15th-century mapmaker who is shipwrecked at sea and tries to come to terms with his mistake-filled past.Mind Equals Blown, interview 12 July 2011. The band once more went through a stylistic transition with their album Rebel- Revive, adopting a more aggressive tone. The departure of Pauley to Of Mice & Men also led to another lyrical shift. Instead of utilizing conceptual and allegorical lyrics, new vocalist Justin Kyle shifted towards more concrete and personal content in his writing.

Within 8 months, 40% of the students at the University of Arizona were using Notehall. By November 2008, the student government at the University of Arizona was considering a partnership with Notehall. In October 2009, Notehall appeared on the ABC reality show Shark Tank where they were successful in landing a $90,000 offer from Barbara Corcoran. However, weeks after the episode aired, Notehall eventually declined Corcoran's offer, and decided to participate in DreamIt Ventures annual start-up incubator and funding event, later in 2009. Notehall in the news Notehall.com has been in the news on Wall Street Journal, Forbes.com, Business Week, Yahoo, US News, Techcrunch etc. The Co-founders of Notehall were nominated as the 2009 Finalists: America's Best Young Entrepreneurs.

Sean Conway, the Co-Founder and CEO of Notehall, Inc. was featured on the Wall Street Journal for being creative in getting funding during the economic recession. DreamIT ventures introduced Notehall.com to the media through an article in Techcrunch during August 2009. Criticism The practice of buying and selling course notes in sites such as Notehall (and competitors such as Course Hero) has been criticised by university officials and faculty members. In California, Mark Cioc, Interim Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education at the University of California Santa Cruz, sent a letter to all faculty members and undergraduates alerting them that the commercialization of class notes is illegal in California. Cioc went so far as to refer to note selling sites as \\"devious,\\" and the UCSC general counsel has sent \\"cease and desist\\" letters to Notehall, OneClass, and CourseHero. Individual faculty members have also expressed concerns that the selling of notes based on their lectures and courses could violate their intellectual property rights. Illinois Institute of Technology employee and former DePaul University faculty member Gina Mieszczak said, “If I put the time and effort into developing a brief summary of a class I was teaching or a particular lesson, I would be extremely disappointed if it were put on the Internet and people were making a profit off of it, especially without my permission.” University of Manitoba faculty member Brad MacKenzie said, “In my view, these kinds of postings, not only violate intellectual priority laws, but are unethical in the way that they take what is private information and post them in a public domain.\\" Even the Colorado State University guide to Notehall, OneClass, Course Hero, and Koofers explains, \\"Uploading an instructor's work product is a copyright violation issue. Examples are a PowerPoint presentation or study guide prepared by the instructor, even if it has been distributed to the class. Students may not profit from another's work.\\" Finally, Indiana University- Bloomington professor Edward Castronova noted that this sort of commercialization of classroom note taking can easily become a black market (just as gold farming has in online games): \\"How long before we have 'note farmers' - people who go to class just to take notes and sell them?\\" Others feel these criticisms unjustified. They note that sharing notes promotes learning, which is the purpose of classes, and that notes taken in class are the property of those creating them.Inside Higher Education, October 6, 2009 References Category:Companies based in San Francisco Category:Education companies of the United States Category:Online marketplaces of the United States Category:Internet properties established in 2008 Category:Student organizations in the United States Category:University of Arizona ","title":"Notehall"},{"id":"26700123","text":"The Dignity Health Event Center is a multipurpose arena in Bakersfield, California.

Based in London for most of their career, they released four albums that were influenced by the 1970s jazz fusion styles of bands such as Mahavishnu Orchestra, Weather Report, and Return to Forever.  History  The band was formed when the founder members of Osanna, Elio D'Anna (saxophone and flute) and Danilo Rustici (guitar) were joined by Danilos’ 17-year-old brother, Corrado Rustici (guitar and vocals) from Cervello. They were joined by Luciano Milanese (bass) and Dede Lo Previte (drums) from Circus 2000. Their first album, Blink was released in 1976 and has a strong English progressive rock influence. It became the only recording by the band to be released in Italy. Following the departure and return to Italy of three band members, D'Anna and Corrado formed a new line-up with New Trolls Atomic System keyboardist, Renato Rosset. Having started out with a strong progressive influence, the band now started to move towards a jazz- fusion sound. The second album, Vimana, was recorded with a number of distinguished guest musicians, including Mahavishnu Orchestra drummer Narada Michael Walden, Genesis/Brand X drummer Phil Collins and Brand X bass player Percy Jones. The band completed their line-up with two new members; Barry Johnson on bass and vocals and former Atomic Rooster and Ibis drummer, Ric Parnell. They went on to record Wings of Love in 1977. The band moved to the USA for their final album Sun City, which was released in 1978. Following this recording, D'Anna returned to Italy where he became a producer. Rustici also went on to a successful career as a musician and producer, collaborating with many famous artists such as Zucchero and Whitney Houston.Corrado Rustici's official site Johnson went on to join Lenny White's group Twennynine, while Parnell featured in the 1984 film This is Spinal Tap.

Attribution: Bundesarchiv, Bild 183-27714-0001 / CC-BY- SA A cleaving axe or cleaver is a form of axe used within green woodworking to split wood lengthways. Cleaving (riving) is used to turn a log into lumber or billets (short or thick pieces of wood) into firewood. Splitting axe is sometimes described as an old name for a splitting maulhttp://northernwoodlands.org/knots_and_bolts/maul_vs_axe Maul vs. Axe or froe. Overview A cleaving axe resembles a felling axe but is heavier, more wedge shaped, not sharp-edged and the pole is flat for driving wedges.Schlich, William, and William Rogers Fisher. Schlich's manual of forestry: Volume V: Forest Utilization. 2nd ed. London: Bradbury, Agnew, 1908. 198. Print. The edge is of medium length, almost straight with just a slight camber, and symmetrical top and bottom. A section through the edge is that of a simple splitting wedge.Abbott, Green woodwork, p. 42 The edge itself does not need to be sharp: cleaving relies more on wedge action than chopping (cutting) with an edge. The section of the axe should be triangular though, with flat sides, rather than the deeply hollow-sided forged and welded axes, or the modern convex-sided \\"apple pip\\" axe grind. Nor should the edge be ground at a bevel. The work of using the axe, and its ability to split cleanly, depends on having flat sides with the minimum of friction, rather than all the force of the timber being concentrated on one protruding line. The handle is straight and fairly short, around 18 inches, as the cleaving axe is only held, not swung. As the axe head must penetrate fully into the wood, the pollThe poll is the rear face of an axe, sometimes flat but only rarely intended for hammering. is minimal, narrower than the axe cheeks, and is never used for pounding other tools, lest it damage or mushroom the head.  Cleaving  Cleaving is done by driving a wedge between the fibres of a log, so as to split fibres apart along their weakest path. This work may appear strenuous, but is far less effort than rip sawing by hand. It is first done radially, to split the log into wedged segments. Timbers with medullary rays, such as oak, may be hard to split through these radial rays and so careful alignment is made to split between them. Segments are halved symmetrically at each step, as this encourages them to split more evenly than attempting to cleave off thin sheets repeatedly from one end.Abbott, Green woodwork, p. 77 Cleaving usually begins from one end of a log, by driving the cleaving axe or a splitting wedge into the end of the log. It is driven further by use of a mallet or froe club. As always, a hammer should be avoided when striking a hard steel tool, as it damages the tool by mushrooming it and may even cause cracking. A short log may be split entirely from one end, a long log will require an initial split to be extended along the log by the use of axe or wedges, driven in from the sides. Short logs are cleaved vertically, long ones horizontally. The ability to use several tools at once makes the use of an axe and wedges capable of cleaving far heavier logs than a froe. The froe must also be used gradually from one end, the axe (or wedges) may enter the log from the side. The froe does however have a wider blade, and so may give a more precisely flat surface when cleaving wide timber, such as for roofing shingles. It is common to start cleaving a log with an axe, finish the first heavy splits with wedges, then use a froe to make the finished items.  Related tools  * Billhook, used for light cleaving of withies. * Froe, a precise tool for cleaving wide sections. * Side knife, a light froe. * Splitting wedge, used in multiple, for initial heavy splitting. = Splitting axes = Splitting mauls are heavy axes (6 lbs or more) used for rough splitting of firewood. They have small heads in terms of edge length, but are heavy as they are especially wide across the cheeks and have a steep taper for rapid splitting.The Axe Book, p. 10 To provide the power necessary, they have full-length shafts and are used with a full swing at the log. Splitting is usually done to logs that are already sawn to length and so they may be split vertically. To split longer logs, wedges are driven with the heavy poll of this maul, giving its alternative name of \\"hammer-poll axe\\". Splitting axes are inconsistently described. Some are cleaving axes, used for green woodworking. Others are a crude firewood- splitting axe, but without the heavy poll of a maul. Light axes, unless specifically intended for it, should never be used for hammering with their poll.

It was established by Archbishop Geevarghese Mar Ivanios. The Ashram follows the religious order called Order of the Imitation of Christ (O.I.C.), which is derived from the Catholic devotional book The Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis. History of the founder Geevarghese Panickeruveetil (21 September 1882 – 15 July 1953) was born at Mavelikkara to the Mylitta Panicker family as a member of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. Geevarghese was his baptismal name. At the age of 15, he joined M.D Seminary in Kottayam for high school studies. On 20 April 1898, he received minor orders and was sent to Madras Christian College for higher studies, where he obtained his master's degree. On 15 September 1908, Geevarghese was ordained priest by Vattasseril Mar Dionysius. Just after the ordination, Fr. P.T. Geevarghese was appointed Principal of M.D Seminary. He moved to Calcutta in the year 1913, accepting an invitation from Dr. George Howells, the principal of Serampore College to teach there. He made use of this opportunity to educate the Malankara Youth. About 20 young people from Kerala reached Calcutta for higher education.Fr. Thomas Inchakkalody, Archbishop Mar Ivanios Vol. 1, (2006), pp. 146-147  Foundation of the ashram  At Serampore, Fr. P.T. Geevarghese got more time for prayer and contemplation. He came across the writings of St. Basil on monasticism. The Basilian monastic vision had a great influence on him. Besides the visits to the Sabarmati Ashram of Mahatma Gandhi and Santiniketan of Rabindranath Tagore gave him a new vision of Indian Sannyasa (monasticism). These experiences made him reflect upon starting an order of missionaries to carry out the task of evangelization in India.L. Moolaveettil, The Spiritual Life of Mar Ivanios, Kottayam, 1977, p.74 Slowly the residence of P.T. Geevarghese and his followers at Serampore became an Ashram (monastery), and they began to live a sort of religious life according to the monastic rules of St. Basil, adapting them to Indian culture.Fr. Thomas Kuzhinapurath, \\"Mar Ivanios: Bharata Christava Sanyasathinte Pravachakan\\", Deepika, 15 July 1997. As he accepted this as his way of life, he resigned from the Serampore College. On his return from Calcutta, Fr. Geevarghese looked for a location to establish an ashram. One of his friends, Advocate E. J. John, donated of land at Mundanmala, Ranni-Perunadu, Kerala at the meeting place of the rivers Pampa and Kakkatt. The adjacent area of was bought from the Government of Travancore at a rate of 5 rupees per acre using a fund of about 2000 rupees received from his father. The place was thickly filled with thorny bushes and herbs. P.T. Geevarghese and his followers built a small thatched hut made out of the branches of trees and bamboo. On 15 August 1919, he established with this ashram the first indigenous religious congregation in the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, not yet in communion with the Catholic Church. He prayerfully searched for a name for the ashram and opened the Bible and he got the word \\"Bethany\\". He meditated upon it and concluded that it was an apt name for a religious order which upholds both contemplation and action.Fr. Thomas Inchakkalody, Archbishop Mar Ivanios (Vol.1), pp. 152-171 Eventually, the Bethany Ashram became a place of pilgrimage and spiritual experience. Spiritual retreats and discourses were given by Fr. Geevarghese especially in the Passion Week. P.T. Geevarghese envisioned the ashram also being a shelter for the poor and the marginalised. Along with the ashram, he started a house for the orphans. P.T. Geevarghese founded the Bethany Madhom for religious women in 1925, with the help of the Anglican sisters, entitled Oxford Mission Sisterhood of the Epiphany working at Serampore.  Bishop of Bethany  The Malankara Synod decided to ordain Fr. P.T. Geevarghese bishop of Bethany. He was ordained by Catholicos Baselios Geevarghese I on 1 May 1925. He received the name Mar Ivanios. After the consecration there was a meeting to felicitate Mar Ivanios. In this meeting, he expressed his desire that the church might become one flock under one shepherd. Reunion movement On 20 September 1930, Mar Ivanios along with Mar Theophilos, the suffragan bishop of Bethany, Fr. John Kuzhinapurath OIC, Deacon Alexander Attupurath OIC, Chacko Kiliyileth, and most of the members of both the Bethany orders reunited with the Catholic Church establishing the Eastern Catholic sui iuris Syro-Malankara Catholic Church in India.Fr. Thomas Inchyakkalody, Archbishop Mar Ivanios, Vol. 1, Kottayam, 2006, pp. 470-480. The reunion movement gained rapid momentum under the leadership of Mar Ivanios.

He made his Serie A debut with Roma on 24 September 1967, marking the occasion with a goal in a 1–1 away draw against Inter. He finished his first season with the club with ten goals. On 29 September 1968, he scored the opening goal of the 1968–69 campaign, scoring after only 30 seconds in a 2–1 home defeat to Fiorentina. During the course of his second Serie A season with the club, however, his level of performance dropped due to fever, weight loss, a sore throat, and a high heart rate, but the club's manager Helenio Herrera decided to continue to play him. On 25 January 1969, Taccola was hospitalised due to tonsillitis; he was operated on 5 February. On 2 March 1969, he returned to the pitch but injured his ankle in a game against Sampdoria, and two weeks later, after a game against Cagliari, to which he accompanied the team, he suffered a seizure in the locker room. He died in an ambulance on the way to the hospital, at the age of 24, with official cause of death being heart failure due to pneumonia. He is survived by his widow, Marzia. Taccola scored 7 goals in 12 appearances for Roma during his second season with the club.

His seminal work Generation to Generation, written for the leaders of religious congregations, focused on leaders developing three main areas of themselves: * Being self differentiated * Being non-anxious * Being present with those one is leading His contribution to intercultural communication and understanding in family therapy appears in a key essay, \\"The Myth of the Shiksa\\" (original 1982, collected 2008), using the concept of \\"cultural costume and camouflage\\" to describe the ways that people express their ethnic or cultural identity. This was elaborated in greater detail in the model of cultural family therapy in \\"Chapter 3: The Presenting Culture\\" of A Stranger in the Family by family therapist and transcultural psychiatrist Vincenzo Di Nicola. Echoing cultural anthropologist Clifford Geertz's notion that humans exist through the mediating variable of culture, this model of cultural family therapy uses cultural costume and camouflage as a conceptual tool that Di Nicola calls Masks: \\"Each family, Friedman observed, draws its cultural camouflage from the available reportoire of their culture.\\" Self-differentiation Building on his work, Generation to Generation, Friedman's family and friends published A Failure of Nerve--leadership in the age of the quick fix finishing Friedman's work on his understanding of leaders as \\"self-differentiated or well- differentiated.\\" Friedman illustrates good “self-differentiated” leadership to that present in the great Renaissance explorers, where leaders had: * the capacity to separate oneself from surrounding emotional processes * the capacity to obtain clarity about one’s principles and vision * the willingness to be exposed and be vulnerable * the persistence to face inertial resistance * the self-regulation of emotions in the face of reactive sabotage. Two concepts are critical in Friedman’s model: self-knowledge and self-control. Friedman attacks what he calls the failure of nerve in leaders who are “highly anxious risk-avoiders,” more concerned with good feelings than with progress–one whose life revolves around the axis of consensus. By self- differentiation, the leader maintains his/her integrity (a non-anxious self as opposed to an anxious non-self) and thus promotes “the integrity or prevents the dis-integr-ation of the system he or she is leading.\\" In other places, Friedman argues that the well-differentiated leader:  Bibliography  * Generation to Generation: Family Process in Church and Synagogue (New York: Guilford Press, 1985) * Friedman's Fables (New York: Guildford Press, 1990) * A Failure of Nerve: Leadership in the Age of the Quick Fix (New York: Seabury, 1997) - posthumous * The Myth of the Shiksa and Other Essays (New York: Seabury, 2008) * What Are You Going to Do with Your Life?

Early life and career Born on 11 February 1934, Weir attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in the 1950s, and began writing scripts for television in the 1960s and 1970s, including The Plane Makers (1963–64) and The Troubleshooters, (1966–69; known in the USA as Mogul), as well as The Lotus Eaters (1972). Weir also wrote occasional scripts for many other British TV series, such as Danger Man (US: Secret Agent, 1964), A Family at War (1970–72), The Onedin Line (1971–80), Crown Court (1972–84), and Space: 1999 (1975–78). The Water Margin and Monkey Weir's scriptwriting credits include English-language adaptations of The Water Margin (1976–78, based on the Chinese story Water Margin) and Monkey (1978–80, based on Journey to the West). These two series were produced in Japan using local actors and crew and dubbed into English using British voice over artists. The original English scripts were conceived and written by WeirRadio Times, 10–17 November 1979, pp. 15-16 without the aid of translations, using only brief plot synopses. Weir later wrote a novelisation of The Water Margin, based on the BBC TV series.Weir, D. 1978, The Water Margin, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, Weir's was interviewed for the BBC magazine Radio Times from 10 to 17 November 1979, to coincide with the start of the second series of Monkey. During the interview, he expressed an interest in Buddhism and Eastern culture and religion, which would remain with him for the rest of his life. Doctor Who Weir wrote scripts for six episodes of the BBC science-fiction TV series Doctor Who that were considered too expensive for the original series and were never made, although they were originally due to form part of the fifteenth season, starring Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor, in 1978. The episodes, collectively titled The Killers of the Dark, would have introduced a race of cat people found to be living on Gallifrey, the homeworld of the Time Lords.Doctor Who Magazine Winter Special 1992, DWM Special Edition #8, Doctor Who: The Seventies Later life Weir retired and lived a reclusive life in rural Norfolk and then West Yorkshire.

Urstromtäler are an element of the glacial series. The term is German and means \\"ancient stream valley\\". Although often translated as \\"glacial valley\\", it should not be confused with a valley carved out by a glacier. More accurately some sources call them \\"meltwater valleys\\"Böse, Margot (2005). The Last Glaciation and Geomorphology in: Koster, E. (ed.): The Physical Geography of Western Europe, Oxford University Press, p. 61Selected Soil Associations, Berlin Digital Environmental Atlas, accessed on 23 Dec 2011 or \\"ice-marginal valleys\\".Jürgen Ehlers, Philip Leonard Gibbard (ed.) (2004). Quaternary glaciations: extent and chronology, Part 3, Elsevier, London, Oxford, San Diego, Amsterdam. p. 139.  Emergence and structure  Section through an Urstromtal Important for the emergence of the Urstromtäler is the fact that the general lie of the land on the North German Plain and in Poland slopes down from south to north. Thus the ice sheet that advanced from Scandinavia flowed into a rising terrain. The meltwaters could therefore only flow for a short distance southwards over the sandurs (outwash plains) before having to find a way to the North Sea basin that was parallel to the ice margin. At that time, the area that is now the North Sea was dry as a result of the low level of the sea. As elements of the glacial series, Urstromtäler are intermeshed with sandur areas for long stretches along their northern perimeters. It was over these outwash plains that the meltwaters poured into them. Urstromtäler are relatively uniformly composed of sands and gravels; the grain size can vary considerably, however. Fine sand dominates especially in the upper sections of the Urstromtal sediments. The thickness of the Urstromtal sediments also varies a great deal, but is mostly well over ten metres. Urstromtäler have wide and very flat valley bottoms that are between 1.5 and 20 kilometres wide. The valley sides, by contrast are only a few to a few dozen metres high. The bottom and the edges of an Urstromtal may have been significantly altered by more recent processes, especially the thawing of dead ice blocks or the accumulation of sand dunes. In the post-glacial period, many Urstromtäler became bogs due to their low lying situation and the high water table.  Urstromtäler in Central Europe  Weichselian Urstromtäler in Brandenburg In Central Europe there are several Urstromtäler from various periods. * Breslau-Magdeburg-Bremen Urstromtal; (Poland, Germany); formed during the Saale glaciation * Glogau-Baruth Urstromtal; (Poland, Germany); formed during the Weichselian * Warsaw-Berlin Urstromtal; (Poland, Germany); formed during the Weichselian * Thorn-Eberswalde Urstromtal; (Poland, Germany); formed during the Weichselian * The term Elbe Urstromtal refers to the Elbe valley roughly at the height of Genthin to the Elbe estuary at Cuxhaven. The meltwaters of the three above-mentioned Weichselian Urstromtäler flowed successively through this valley towards the North Sea basin. * The term Rhine Urstromtal for the Rhine valley from Düsseldorf to its mouth on the North Sea is disputed. The Rhine was certainly a route for meltwaters during the Saale glaciation. The structure of the valley is however clearly older and was formed by recent tectonics. * In the Alpine glaciation zone of Central Europe the term Urstromtal is not used. In this region, the Danube and, periodically, the Rhine carried the meltwaters away. Some sections of the aforementioned main valleys have been given their own names. The Lusatian Urstromtal and the Aller Urstromtal are parts of the Breslau-Magdeburg-Bremen Urstromtal. The Baruth, Berlin and Eberswalde Urstromtäler are common short names for the associated sections of the Urstromtal in Brandenburg. In addition to the large main valleys there are also numerous smaller meltwater valleys (Urstromtalungen). Their appearance is similar to that of the great Urstromtäler, but they are considerably shorter. They are also not linked to a sandur and a terminal moraine. Urstromtäler of Central Europe (Poland, Germany and Denmark especially) were directly connected to the North Atlantic Ocean, via the Channel River, during Pleistocene maximum glaciations, i.e. at times of confluence of the British and Fennoscandian ice-sheets in the intervening North Sea.  Features  Urstromtäler should not be confused with tunnel valleys. The latter are formed beneath, not in front of, the ice mass. In addition most tunnel valleys run from north to south. The principal direction of Urstromtäler is from east to west. Today Urstromtäler are only partly used by rivers, because the majority have found shorter routes to the sea (like the Oder and Vistula). The straight troughs of the Urstromtäler between the rivers were used for canal routes due to their low gradient, for example for the Elbe–Havel Canal or the Oder–Havel Canal. Because the land in North America and on the Russian Plain tilts towards the south, the formation of Urstromtäler there during the ice age did not take place. The Mississippi River and its tributaries carried the meltwaters of the North American ice sheet away. In Eastern Europe the meltwaters flowed down the river basins of the Dnieper, Don and Volga. Urstromtäler, whether sandy or boggy, posed considerable obstacles to movement in the Middle Ages. As a result, the trade routes converged on points where the valley could be crossed comparatively easily. These hubs thus became favourite sites for the founding of towns or castles. Examples from the German state of Brandenburg include Berlin, Fürstenwalde, Luckenwalde and Baruth/Mark, and from Lower Saxony the town of Vorsfelde and Wolfsburg Castle.

Described as \\"the most photographed woman in Britain\\" and \\"arguably the first British supermodel\\", she epitomised post-war glamour and modelled for both Dior and Balenciaga. Early life Barbara Bach was born in British Malaya where her father was a rubber plantation owner. She was sent back to the UK to prep school at the age of eight, moving on to St Mary's School in Calne, Wiltshire as a boarder. She spent a year studying art, giving this up to become an ambulance driver when war broke out. Her wartime engagement to an RAF pilot (she was 17) ended when he was killed in action. She then married commercial pilot Ian Goalen who was killed in a plane crash in 1947, leaving her with a son and daughter. Modelling career Goalen became a model at the age of 24, with her mother taking care of her two young children. She said: \\"I didn't have to work for money, but I needed to for myself\\". While she also remarked – perhaps not entirely seriously – that it was a choice of that or taking in washing, even in austere post-war Britain good models could earn five guineas an hour – equivalent to the weekly wage for many working women of the time. Perks of the job included being treated as members of society, the loan of designer clothes and entrance to any event. Initially Goalen worked as a couture model and accepted every modelling commission, but later was to make her fee four times that of other models and restrict her appearances in order to be more 'exclusive'. Her elegant wasp- waisted shape was the perfect fit for the post-war 'New Look' fashions and she had what Vogue has described as the \\"mink and diamonds\\" look, thanks in part to her gamine short haircut (later more bouffant), arched and elongated eyebrows and high cheekbones. She said: \\"I was seven and a half stone and my measurements were: charlies 33, waist 18 – yes really – and hips 31\\". Early on in her career, she became a favourite of Vogue photographer Clifford Coffin and was also to work with leading fashion names such as Norman Parkinson and Anthony Denney. Her big break came when she met photographer John French. From 1950, she made frequent appearances in the pages of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. She also became among the first British models to be employed by French couture houses – notably Balenciaga and pioneer of the 'New Look' Dior ' – as well as modelling in New York and Australia. She was among the models chosen for a series of influential photoshoots by Elsbeth Juda for export magazine The Ambassador that were designed to promote British culture and industry abroad. Later life and work Goalen retired from modelling when she married Lloyd's underwriter Nigel Campbell in 1954, and the couple had two daughters. Such was her fame after her six-year modelling career that the wedding, at Caxton Hall, Westminster, was mobbed by onlookers. Subsequently known as Mrs Nigel Campbell, she organised the Berkeley dress show (a debutante event and fixture of the 'season') during the 1960s – despite her doubts about its relevance to the times. She also dispensed fashion advice in the Daily Telegraph newspaper and designed children's clothes, which were modelled by her two younger daughters.

Graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1828, he served in the quartermaster corps for most of his career. At the end of the American Civil War, he was awarded the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general. Early life Born March 21, 1805 in Ashfield, Massachusetts, the second son of Electa (Smith) and Ethan Allen Clary was named after the recently executed Irish patriot Robert Emmet. Their family could trace its line back to John and Sarah Clary who arrived in Watertown in 1640. The younger Clarys were raised in a house at Benton Park, at the corner of State and Federal streets in Springfield, where their father clerked a few blocks away at the armory. Springfield's Walnut Street was named after the trees which lined the Clary property. Appointed to the U. S. Military Academy in 1823, Clary graduated thirteenth in his class of 1828. Commissioned a second lieutenant in the 5th U.S. Infantry Regiment, Clary, like many in his class, was sent to the Jefferson Barracks at St. Louis, Missouri. On March 31, 1829, Clary married his first wife, Esther Philipson, the daughter of a prosperous merchant family; West Point classmate Jefferson Davis served as his best man. Military career Clary served at various stations throughout the country prior to the Civil War. By 1861, he had been promoted to major and was chief quartermaster of the Department of Utah. =Civil War= Shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War, Clary was appointed chief quartermaster for the Department of West Virginia. In July 1862, he served as chief quartermaster of the short-lived Army of Virginia in the summer of 1862 under the command of Major General John Pope. After that command was absorbed by the Army of the Potomac, Clary served as chief quartermaster in several army departments until August 1864, when he was placed in charge of the Memphis army depot, in which capacity he served until the end of the war. On June 30, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Clary for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general, U.S.A., (Regular Army), to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on July 25, 1866.* Eicher, John H. and Eicher, David J.

Early life  Born in Budapest into a bourgeois family, Mérei often spent time in his parents' photography studio at the Garay Bazaar. He did not like school, where he felt excluded and his teachers' brutality caused him much pain. He read a lot, even 4-500-page books in one sitting. His mother's liaisons with several men disturbed him. After graduating from high school, he studied at the Sorbonne from 1928, even though his mother wanted him to study in Berlin. He specialised in political economy, statistics and literature and studied eleven languages. It was child psychology and vocational guidance that really captivated his interest. Henri Wallon received him at the university as his pupil, and directed him in studying child psychology. He joined the French Communist Party in 1930. He gave his first scientific lecture in 1932. The lecture, in which he criticised Jean Piaget, attracted Wallon's disapproval, and it was then that Mérei developed his key idea, the essence of which is the social determination of humans. He obtained two degrees, one from a career advising college, and one from the Sorbonne Faculty of Arts in philosophy, sociology, psychology and pedagogy. He made lifelong friends in Paris, where they and his teachers shaped his ideals and his world view. Career After his return to Hungary in 1934 for a time he became a pupil of Leopold Szondi, as a fresh graduate he could not find employment, so he worked as a psychologist without pay at the Állami Gyermeklélektani Intézet (State Children's Psychological Institute), founded by János Schnell) until 1938. He was the first to research the social experience affecting the individual and the social role of the formation of rules and norms. He published two theses in 1937: Child playing with buttons and The country-building child. Between 1938 and 1940 he worked at the Special Education Teacher Training College, once again without a salary, so he lived on the money he received from teaching languages. He married a teacher of special education (Vera Mérei née Molnár). They learned the organisation of examinations and worked together. He was expelled from the laboratory because of the anti-Jewish laws. From 1940 he worked at the outpatient department of the Patronage AssociationIn Hungarian: Patronázs Egyesület. led by Júlia György. In 1942 he wrote his first book, The Psychology of Choosing a Career, before he was sent away to do labour service. In 1944 he escaped, crossed the front line and joined the Soviet army, where he attained the rank of captain by the time his military service ended. From 1945 until 1948 he was the leader of the Fővárosi Lélektani Intézet (Budapest Institute of Psychology), a teacher at the Pedagógiai Főiskola (Pedagogical College) and at the Eötvös Kollégium, and the leader of the central seminar of NÉKOSZ (People's National Association of Colleges). He was appointed the head of Országos Neveléslélektani Intézet (National Institute of Educational Psychology) in 1949. During these years he wrote several studies and three books: The Child's World View (1945), Collective Experience (1947) and Study of the Child (1948). His collective experience experiments are among the most important psychological experiments. In 1949 he was awarded the Kossuth Prize (silver medal) for his pedagogical work. In 1950 the institute was liquidated, Mérei was discharged from his position, and he became a translator for a living. He was rehabilitated in 1956, becoming a key scientific scholar at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Institute of Psychology, then in 1958 at the Institute of Biochemistry. He was arrested in October 1958 and charged with seditious organisation and was sentenced to 10 years. He spent his imprisonment first in Budapest, then Sátoraljaújhely and finally in Vác. He started his \\"Psychological Diary\\" at the National Prison in Sátoraljaújhely in 1960 (he wrote it on toilet paper for want of any other paper). His health deteriorated while he was in prison and he had a stroke. He received an amnesty in March 1963. From February 1964 he worked at the National Neurological and Mental Hospital where he founded and became the leader of the clinical psychology laboratory. With the aim of having a workshop, he gathered his colleagues and students around him, including Ferenc Szakács, Lívia Nemes and Ágnes Binét. His laboratory became the centre for the training of psychologists in Hungary. Ágnes Binét became the co-author of two of his successful books, Child Psychology and the Ablak-Zsiráf child encyclopedia. His sociometric examinations focused on the inner dynamics of groups and the roles of the individual. In his book Child Study he writes about the world view of children and the logic of the child's mind, based on his own experiments. It contains his theories about the development of the knowledge of mores and ethics, social behaviour, the sociometric analysis of the classes, the world view of the children and the development of values. Between 1965 and 1970 fifty issues of the serial Vademecum, founded by Mérei, were published. Most of these were written by him for his students. They are still used in the education of psychologists. In the 1970s he wrote several significant books: The hidden network of communities (1971), Clinical methods in psychodiagnostics (1974) and Clinical Psychology (1974). From 1976 he led the Hungarian Psychological Society (Magyar Pszichológiai Társaság) and the training of psychodramatists. In 1982 he was named a doctor of psychology by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and was awarded the Pál Ranschburg medallion. An interview film was prepared with him in 1984, when he was recovering after a serious operation. Parts of the interview, in which he was criticising the politics of Hungary, were not shown on TV until 2009. He first wrote about his views on educational policy in 1948 in the study Democracy in School. This was not published until 1985. The ideal school, according to Mérei, is child-centered, and raises the child to be able to think independently. \\"If we want to change people, then it is essential to change pedagogy (...) so I studied the possibilities of change during pedagogy.\\" He considered the training of teachers to be very important and did much to improve it.

Let , and formally define the conjugate one- form to be .  Motivation  There is a clear connection with complex analysis. Let us write a complex number z in terms of its real and imaginary parts, say x and y respectively, i.e. . Since , from the point of view of complex analysis, the quotient tends to a limit as dz tends to 0. In other words, the definition of ω∗ was chosen for its connection with the concept of a derivative (analyticity). Another connection with the complex unit is that (just as ). For a given function f, let us write , i.e. , where ∂ denotes the partial derivative. Then . Now d((df)∗) is not always zero, indeed , where .

The hillfort, which is situated among rocky outcrops, is ideally placed for defence and likely served as a watchtower and possibly as a signal tower. Some have speculated that it was built to alert a small fort situated in the town of Holyhead in the case of raiders coming in from the Irish Sea, while others have suggested that it may have been a lighthouse. The hillfort is now mostly rubble, but its walls can still be made out, including a large stone rampart on the north and east sides which reaches 3 metres at points. The entrance to the fort was through a rocky gully. The footings of a tower were discovered when the site was excavated; its stones are believed to date from the 2nd to the 4th centuries.

He belonged to the Phagmodrupa dynasty which reigned over Tibet or parts of it from 1354 to the early 17th century.

It is now owned and operated by the family-run Denison Society, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 15, 1979. Description The Denison Homestead is located in a rural setting of eastern Mystic, on Pequotsepos Road roughly midway between Mistuxet Avenue and Jerry Browne Road. The house is set facing south on the north side of a bend in the road. It is a 2-1/2 story timber frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and shingled exterior, and is set mainly on a rock ledge, with only a small basement area in one corner. The main facade is five bays wide, with the entrance at the center. The door itself dates to about 1800, but is mounted using original iron strap hinges. The interior follows a central chimney plan, with a narrow entry vestibule that also houses a winding stair. There are parlor spaces on either side of the chimney, with the kitchen behind. The parlors have modestly carved fireplace paneling, and many rooms have original floorboards that are up to wide.

The band has had a large number of musicians, with brothers Edgardo (Davich) and Leonard (Leonidas) Mattioli as only constant members. History The band's history, if you count their releases as milestones, could be divided in four big moments: the absolute underground (with several EPs and other independent recordings, 1997–2002), and starting with their first label album, eras named after their releases: Filosofías de Insomnio (Philosophies of Insomnia, 2002–2004), Tiempos Modernos (Modern Times, 2005–2006), Effecto Dominó (Domino Effect, 2007–2008), and Nómades (2009-current). =Absolute Underground (1997-2002)= ltp* takes its first steps in the final months of 1997, during a time in which the hip hop genre was being highly advertised, particularly by MTV. It is then when they start to play on stage, without much knowledge or a polished sound, but with enthusiasm. Their sound in particular lacked polish because it was strongly conditioned by the technological tools the band members had access to during the time. At first they used a Commodore Amiga 1200, an 8-bit sampler, and a Boss Dr. 5 rhythm box. Their sound was basic, with strong drums, blues and jazz samples, and simple bass lines, almost to the point of saturation (more because they liked it that way, than due to the technical limitations). Their first demo is from 1998–99, produced by Maneco, then member of Uruguayan band Elefante (later Rendher). It was filled with funk references, with samples from musicians like James Brown and other examples of the genre. This first demo allowed them to knock on the door of any radio that would let them in; primarily community radios (a relationship which still lasts to these days) and the show Mundo Cañon, in the popular X FM radio. Originally the band is made up of five members, but the core of the band ends up being the aforementioned Mattioli brothers (Davich and Leonidas) as MCs, and DJ Irish; in what is the most typical hip hop expression in terms of music (perhaps the only one they'd reflect): two MCs and one DJ. Around this time the band plays primarily in stages of their hometown of Montevideo, flirting with the local hardcore punk scene; playing in festivals full of bands of those genres. Their means of transportation was usually public buses, with mixers and turntables under their arms, and vinyls and minidiscs in backpacks. During the years 2000/2001 they take part of a collective called Oeste Pro Funk (Pro Funk West), a gathering of hip hop bands and solo acts, attempting to combine their momentums. OPF releases an album with tracks by all of their members: bands La Teja Pride and Contra Las Cuerdas, plus MCs DRRVI (Nicolás Barragán, today known only by his last name, current member of ltp*) and Canona (former member of Critical Zone). =Philosophies of Insomnia (2002-2004)= 2002 was a year full of deep transformations for latejapride*, starting by their lineup. DJ Irish left the band, with Marcelo “Gezzio” Geninazzio joining as DJ, Ismael Carnales on samplers, and Leonidas and Davich staying as MCs, while the latter took the mantle of \\"beatmaker\\". The band's sound starts to sound more like a re-interpretation of down tempo and its variations (trip hop, jazz, chill out, etc.), something that becomes more obvious in their live presentations, which the band started to fill with long and slow-paced instrumental interludes, interspaced between faster-paced tracks where the MCs were the center of attention. In this context the band comes up with the concept of an EP that would be recorded and later distributed under the name \\"Sueños de Invierno\\" (Winter Dreams). The EP was a step up from previous releases in its physical presentation, which graphic design by photographer Naela Vitureira (cousin of the Mattioli brothers, and from that date, steady associate of the band), showing more professionalism not only sound-wise, but package-wise. During this time the band also starts to experiment with audiovisual projections to complement their live shows, initially over their instrumental tracks. The first show with projections took place in the Florencio Sanchez theater in Montevideo, on September 22, 2001. The first videos shown along with instrumental tracks \\"Tauro\\" and \\"Domenica Intermezzo\\" were selections from the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion, compiled and projected by Martín \\"MaGnUs\\" Pérez, a job that was later taken over by VJ Saurio in a more professional capacity, and then by the collective known as Elementum Crew. Sueños de Invierno received a wider exposure than previous releases by the band, which allowed them, among other things, to create a link with the Uruguayan record label Bizarro Records. After a conversation via e-mail and some informal meetings with Andrés Sanabria, art director of the label, an agreement was reached. latejapride* would produce and record an album on their own, and Bizarro would release and distribute it. The album was named Filosofías de Insomnio (Philosophies of Insomnia), and it was produced by Daniel Anselmi (locally prestigious electronic musician, and member of the band Amnios), releasing it in September 2003. While recording the album, the band had to revise their creative processes, in several aspects. On one hand, the experience of working with Anselmi was fruitful, since it not only provided them with a work method that served to counter the chaotic creative processes of the band, but the producer also made significant artistic contributions. New members joined the band, first Iván Krisman on bass guitar, and after recording and releasing the album, most of the musicians that had played on it were welcomed into the band properly. Lorena Nader joined as a singer, Daniel \\"Vampiro\\" Noble joined on the electric guitar, and Coco Cáner joined playing the electroacoustic guitar. Old partners of the band were also guests on the album, like the band Contra Las Cuerdas and the solo rapper El Barragán (formerly DRRVI, both from Oeste Pro Funk), and the now defunct rock band Kirlian. As a side project, the band composes and plays live music for the play \\"El Hueco\\" (The Hole), written by Gabriel Peveroni and directed by María Dodera. This activity earns them a Florencio award, the maximum award in Uruguayan theater. During this period, in the year 2004, latejapride* is part of the second volume of a tribute to poet Pablo Neruda, \\"Marinero En Tierra\\" (Seaman On Land\\"), along with other Uruguayan artists like Jorge Drexler, Sordromo, and Jorge Nasser; as well as international ones like La Oreja De Van Gogh, Alex Ubago and Ruben Blades. =Modern Times (2005-2006)= Tiempos Modernos (Modern Times) was the second album of the band, released in September 2005. Its sound was clearly different to what latejapride* had been doing so far. The guitars, which before were almost exclusively window dressing, now had a starring role, while downtempo was set aside, and the MCs' strength resurfaced after years of electronic experimentation. It took literally a thousand studio hours to record and mix, with Daniel Anselmi again as producer, this time joined by Davich. Home studios were also set aside, since the more rock sound of the band now required professional recording studios; Oasis being the studio of choice. The band's lineup also changed, with the return of DJ Irish and the exit of Gezzio and Ismael Carnales. Touring the country with this album, ltp* played in places as diverse as discothèques, pubs, festivals, as well as events hosted by social organizations such as NGO and workers unions, due to the band's long standing social conscience (something reflected in their lyrics). Among other side projects, the band remixes the theme from TV show The Twilight Zone as an ending theme for radio show \\"Perdidos En El Eter\\" . =Domino Effect (2007-2008)= Little by little, the band started to go back to the sound system scheme; with entrenched DJs that allow MCs to launch themselves to victory or noble defeat, with a microphone in hand and the beat on their shoulders. Leonidas decided to concentrate on turntables and samplers along with DJ Irish, without abandoning the emceeing completely. El Barragán joins the band, not only as MC but supporting Davich as a beatmaker. Krisman and Nader remain in the band (the latter spending some time in Europe, though), while Cáner and Noble leave. Their third album, Effecto Dominó (Domino Effect) is released in November 2007, and again it shows an evolution of the band's sound, with Daniel Anselmi's production as usual. The absence of non-sampled guitars once again make the scratches and programmed drums the musical stars; perhaps due to the presence of two DJs. Strong drum and bass and downtempo influences return, joined by new influences from styles like reggae and bossa nova. The political, social, and even environmental content of the lyrics is again present, as was to be expected; but this is not a redundant album. On the contrary, the themes, apart from those mentioned, show a sense of belonging to a global (but not globalized) community, reflected in one of the lines from its first track: stories of a thousand cities, and a single neighborhood. As usual, not only for ltp* but for most hip hop acts, and the Uruguayan scene in general, the album includes collaborations by several guests: Lys Gainza, Marcela Schenck, Santullo (formerly L. Mental, member of Peyote Asesino and Bajofondo), Cucaracha Sound System and Luisa Pereira. latejapride*, since the release of their first label album, has played in almost all of Uruguay, also playing in Argentina (Buenos Aires and Santa Fe) and Brazil (Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro). In May 2008, the band received the Graffiti Award for best \\"Pop/Rock/Alternative\\" album (the Graffitis are the main music awards in the country), and the Iris award for \\"Album of the Year\\", given by El País, one of the largest newspapers in the country. =Nomads (2009-current)= In 2009 the band releases their fourth album, Nómades (Nomads). This album follows the creative line started in the previous one, Effecto Dominó. With twelve tracks, the album keeps rap as the central genre, although the beats are still influenced by other rhythms, in keeping with (according to the band) the concept of music to enjoy with the body, of the physical of its art as center of all compositions. So far, they've produced three videoclips for this album, Portarse Mal (March 2010), Abandonado El video (April 2011), and Esquivando Penas (December 2011). In 2011, the Uruguayan Music Cluster publishes its catalog, including the band's albums.http://clustermusicauy.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/catmus_alta.pdf Discography =LP= * Filosofías de Insomnio (Bizarro Records. 2003) * Tiempos Modernos (Bizarro Records. 2005) * Efecto Dominó (Bizarro Records. 2007) * Nómades (Bizarro Records. 2009) =EP= * La Teja Pride EP (Independent. 1998 - 1999) * Sueños de Invierno (Independent. 2002) * Colección de Pequeños Errores y Otras Falacias Rítmicas (Nota Negra. 2009) =Collaborations= * Oeste Pro Funk (Independent. 2001) * Tributo a Neruda: Marinero en Tierra, volumen 2 (Bizarro Records. 2004) References External links * Official website (in Spanish) * Official Facebook (in Spanish) * Official MySpace (in Spanish) * Efecto Dominó review (in English) * Nómades review (in English) Category:Uruguayan musical groups Category:Uruguayan hip hop musicians Category:Hip hop groups Category:Musical groups established in 1997 Category:1997 establishments in Uruguay ","title":"Latejapride*"},{"id":"26700735","text":"Launch Entry Suit modeled by technician. Launch Entry Suit at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The Launch Entry Suit (LES), known as the \\"pumpkin suit\\", is a partial-pressure suit that was worn by all Space Shuttle crews for the ascent and entry portions of flight from STS-26 (1988) to STS-65 (1994). It was completely phased out by STS-88 (late 1998)Video evidence of suit's use being discontinuedPhotographic evidence of suit's use being discontinued and replaced by the ACES suit. The suit was manufactured by the David Clark Company of Worcester, Massachusetts.  History  The LES was first worn by U.S. Air Force pilots in the mid-1990s, replacing a similar suit worn by SR-71 and U-2 pilots, and was identical to the suits worn by X-15 pilots and Gemini astronauts. Unlike the ACES suit, which is a full-pressure suit, the high- altitude suits were partial pressure suits, thus requiring a rubber diaphragm around the wearer's face. With the development of the Space Shuttle, and the inclusion of ejection seats on the Space Shuttle Columbia on the first four flights (STS-1 to STS-4), NASA decided to adopt modified versions of the suit, the modifications being the attachments to the parachute harness, and the adoption of inflatable bladders in the legs to prevent the crew from passing out during reentry. One other modification, a mount for prescription glasses, was incorporated for astronaut John W. Young, who wore modified bifocal reading glasses (resembling aviator sunglasses, but with the top portion, usually for distance seeing, being of regular glass, and the bottom, for reading, of the wearer's prescription) during the flight. The four test flights, between April 1981 and July 1982, went without incident, and the pressure suits performed without any problems. With the termination of the test flight program, all flights from STS-5 to STS-51-L (the Challenger disaster) saw the crew wearing one-piece light blue flight suits, escape harnesses, and helmets similar to the pressure suit helmets, but fitted around the head with a clamshell-like closure. After Challenger, NASA, in need of an escape system, also required the reintroduction of the wearing of pressure suits during the launch and landing portions of the flight. The initial eight suits were navy blue, similar in color to the previous flight suits, the rest of the suits were bright orange to contrast against the dark blue ocean water they'd most likely be used in. The blue suits were never used on an actual mission. For the first \\"Return to Flight\\" STS-26, the five-man astronaut crew wore, for the first time, new Launch & Entry Pressure Suits (LES). Resembling the Gemini spacesuit in appearance, but identical in function to the SR-71 partial-pressure suits, the new LES suits featured a one-piece torso-limb suit with a Nomex outer layer (which NASA was able to use on the Shuttle due to the mixed nitrogen/oxygen sea-level atmosphere), closed with a rear-entry zipper, and featuring a full-pressure helmet with a polycarbonate clear faceplate, mechanical seal, and black sunshade, zippered-on gloves (resembling the gloves used by astronaut Alan Shepard on his Mercury space suit), heavy black \\"paratrooper\\" style safety boots, and a survival backpack, which is donned prior to entering the Orbiter and contains a parachute, life raft, survival gear, and a 30-minute supply of breathing oxygen and a water tank. Because of the helmet design, which rested on the astronaut's shoulders and allowed them to move their head around freely, astronauts were now required to wear a communications cap similar to those worn by Apollo astronauts, and because they were white (later changed to brown), the suit resembled the Vostok pressure suit worn by Yuri Gagarin. The suits were designed to withstand pressures up to 40,000 feet (12 kilometers), and immersion in the ocean for up to 24 hours at 5 °C (40 °F). Because of the limitations of protection the LES could offer, NASA and the David Clark Company introduced the current ACES design in 1995, which thereafter was the only suit used for Shuttle missions. Based on the LES, but being a full-pressure suit, the ACES suit now incorporates gloves on disconnecting lock rings on the wrists, liquid cooling and improved ventilation, and an extra layer of insulation. The ACES suit is analogous to the Sokol suits used for Soyuz missions and its functions are virtually the same, the only differences being the ACES suit having a detachable helmet and survival backpack, while the Russian suit has an integrated helmet and no backpack, due to the limitations in space aboard the Soyuz, and that the spacecraft is an entry capsule, not a winged spacecraft or lifting body.  Specifications  Each suit was sized individually, although most suits could be worn by astronauts of different heights. It included a parachute and flotation device.

They are primarily employed in the screening and reconnaissance role or in a fire support role of expeditionary forces where big main battle tanks cannot be made available or can't operate safely. Early light tanks were generally better armed and armored than armored cars, but used tracks in order to provide better cross-country mobility. The fast light tank was a major feature of the pre-World War II buildup, where it was expected they would be used to exploit breakthroughs in enemy lines created by slower, heavier tanks. Numerous small tank designs and \\"tankettes\\" were developed during this period and known under a variety of names, including the \\"combat car\\". The light tank has been one of the few tank variants to survive the development of the main battle tank, and has seen use in a variety of roles including the support of light airborne or amphibious forces and reconnaissance. Modified IFVs are assuming these roles in many militaries due to their immediate availability, and as a cheaper alternative to developing and fielding a pure light tank. History =20th century= World War I US Army operating Renault FT tanks In World War I, industrial initiative also led to swift advances. The car industry, already used to vehicle mass production and having much more experience in vehicle layout, designed the first practical light tanks in 1916, a class largely neglected by the British. It would be Renault's small tank design the FT, incorporating a proper climbing face for the tracks, that was the first tank to incorporate a top-mounted turret with a full rotation. In fact the FT was in many respects the first truly modern tank having a layout that has been followed by almost all designs ever since: driver at the front; main armament in a fully rotating turret on top; engine at the rear. Previous models had been \\"box tanks\\", with a single crowded space combining the role of engine room, fighting compartment, ammunition stock and driver's cabin. The FT would have the largest production run of any tank of the war - with over 3,700 built (most of those in 1918) it was more numerous than all British and German tanks combined. Interwar British light tank Mk V Type 95 Ha-Go tanks in New Britain following the Japanese surrender The Carden Loyd tankette and its derivatives were adopted by several nations as small tracked vehicles carrying a machine gun for armament. At a time of limited military budgets, tankettes were relatively cheap and functioned as reconnaissance vehicles and mobile machine gun posts. In 1928, the British firm of Vickers-Armstrong started promoting another design by John Carden and Vivien Loyd as the \\"six-ton tank\\". Although rejected by the British Army, it was bought by a large number of nations in small numbers. It formed the basis of the Soviet T-26 (around 10,000 built) and the Polish 7TP tank and influenced the Italian Fiat M11/39. The British Army did not use the design as a light tank themselves but a developed version of the Carden Loyd tankette as the starting point for a series of British light tanks intended for use in imperial policing and expeditionary warfare. As the only tank fit for immediate manufacture, it was a key element in the expansion of the British Army in the period leading up to the outbreak of war.Harris, J. P. (1995). Men, Ideas, and Tanks: British Military Thought and Armoured Forces, 1903–1939. Manchester University Press. . p275 In general, French tanks of the 1930s were well-armored, innovative vehicles that owed little to foreign designs. However, the light tanks lacked firepower and almost all French tanks were handicapped by their one-man turrets, even the larger tanks such as the Char B1, which overworked the commander who, besides directing the vehicle, or even a troop, had to load and aim the turret gun. The lack of radios with the light tanks was not seen as a major drawback, since French doctrine called for slow-paced, deliberate maneuvers in close conformance to plans. The role of small unit leaders was to execute plans, not to take the initiative in combat. In 1939, a belated effort was made to improve flexibility and increase the number of radios. Throughout the interwar period the US produced only a few hundred tanks. From the end of World War I to 1935, only 15 tanks were produced. Most were derivatives or foreign designs or very poor quality private designs. The Christie designs were among the few better examples, but the US Army acquired only three Christies and did not pursue the idea any further. Budget limitations and the low priority given to the army meant that there were few resources for building tanks. The US Army instead developed and tested tank components such as suspensions, tracks, and transmissions. This paid off when production had to be initiated on the outbreak of war. World War II German Panzer I in combat during the German invasion of Norway = Soviet = The Soviet BT tanks were the most advanced in the 1930s, extremely fast and mounting high velocity 45 mm cannons. Their only drawback were their petrol engines which caught fire often and easily during the Nomonhan fighting which lasted from about May through September 1939.Coox p. 437, 998 The Japanese Type 95 Ha-Go light tank was equipped with a diesel engine, and although mounting a 37 mm cannon, it was a low velocity gun with a maximum effective range of about 700 meters. However, this conflict would be instrumental in developing the famous T-34 medium tank. = Germany = Germany's armored Panzer force was not especially impressive at the start of the war. In the invasions of Poland and France, the German forces were mostly made up of the Panzer I and Panzer II light tanks. The Panzer I was little more than a training vehicle armed only with machine guns, the Panzer II with a 20 mm cannon. The Panzer division also included some Czech designed light tanks - the Panzer 35(t) and the Panzer 38(t). = American = American light tank development started with the M2 light tank series. These light tanks were mechanically very reliable, with good mobility. However, they had a high silhouette, and only a few saw combat. The M3 Stuart series was an improvement of the M2 with better armor. The new medium tank just entering production in 1940 was the M2A1. This was a poor design with thin armor and a high silhouette. The M3 Stuart saw use in the North African Campaign but was relegated to reconnaissance as soon as US-built medium tanks became available. Further light tank development in the war led to the improved M5 Stuart and then included the M24 Chaffee. = British = The British withdrew their light tank designs from their armoured divisions early in the war, but used some later designs for minor amphibious operations and airborne operations.Flint, Keith (2006). Airborne Armour: Tetrarch, Locust, Hamilcar and the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment 1938–1950. Helion & Company Ltd. p13 In general they used armoured cars for reconnaissance and the last of the light tank designs, the light tank Mk VIII \\"Harry Hopkins\\", was only produced in small numbers. = Japan = The Japanese made extensive use of light tanks that were much better suited to jungle warfare than larger designs, such as the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank. Cold War South Vietnamese M41 Walker Bulldog tanks during a training operation Light tanks continued to be built, but for very limited roles such as amphibious reconnaissance, support of airborne units, and in rapid- intervention forces that were not expected to face enemy tanks. The Soviet PT-76 is a specialized light tank –amphibious with sufficient firepower to engage other reconnaissance vehicles, but very lightly armored. The US fielded small numbers of the M41 Walker Bulldog with a high velocity 76mm gun, and better armor, but it suffered from range limits, and its weight was too heavy for most air transport of the day. The US M551 Sheridan had similar strengths and weaknesses, but could also be airdropped, either by parachute or LAPES. The French had their AMX-13 light tank, which was designed for its capability to be quickly air-dropped for use with paratroopers and also able to support lightly-armed infantry and perform force-reconnaissance effectively. The British FV101 Scorpion, the fire support variant of the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) series of vehicles that replaced armored cars in British service, has been described as a light tank and was sold to many smaller nations. Another light tank in the Cold War era was the Swedish IKV 91 armored vehicle. It had a low-pressure 90mm gun, strong armor against 20mm grenades, and it was fully amphibious. Post–Cold War FV101 Scorpion Light tanks, such as the PT-76, continue to play a small role in tank warfare, although many are losing favor to cheaper, faster, lighter armored cars. The light tank still fills an important niche in many armies, especially for nations with airborne divisions, Marine Infantry, or those without the resources and funding for main battle tanks. They have important advantages over heavier tanks in Southeast Asia and other nations in the Equatorial region. Their compact dimensions and short to nonexistent barrel overhang lets them maneuver through thick rain forests, and their weight reduces the risk of getting stuck in mud, and simplifies recovery of stuck or damaged tanks. This makes the light tank the preferred choice for infantry support in Equatorial nations. Post–Cold War light tanks include the Stingray light tank, Ajax, and the M8 AGS. Light tanks based on infantry fighting vehicles chassis include the CV90105T, 2S25 Sprut-SD, Tanque Argentino Mediano, ASCOD LT 105, and Harimau. Modern light tank design =Countermeasures= Typically, the armor in contemporary light tanks is modular, sometimes up to three configurations. The flat hull necessary for amphibious light tanks to plane across the surface of the water is not nearly as blast-resistant as the V-shaped hull. It has been suggested that underbelly armor appliqué could be applied after the light tanks come ashore and before they encounter explosive devices.RS22947 The Marines Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV): Background and Issues for Congress =Weapons= M551 Sheridan firing a Shillelagh guided missile A gun capable of defeating modern tanks at reasonable ranges requires a large vehicle to carry it. Gun weight is typically the product of caliber and muzzle velocity. Large caliber guns on light tanks often sacrifice muzzle velocity in interest of saving weight. These guns are effective against close- quarter targets but lack the power and/or accuracy to effectively engage heavier vehicles at a distance. =Mobility= The design of the PT-76 allows for easy transition from land to water with little preparation A C-130 delivering an M551 Sheridan (now retired from service) using a low-altitude parachute-extraction system (LAPES). SK-105 Kürassier 19 ton light tank of the Bolivian Army with 105mm gun in oscillating turret, 2007 Tactical mobility Some light tanks such as the PT-76 are amphibious, typically being propelled in the water by hydrojets or by their tracks. Most amphibious light tanks weigh little and often utilize aluminum armor. Some light tanks require no modifications for river crossings. Crews simply raise the easily accessible cloth sides around the hull, cover the hatches, turn on the bilge pump and shift the transmission to water operations. Often, a fold down trim vane is erected to stop water from flooding into the hatch. Strategic mobility Some light tanks, such as the M551 Sheridan armored reconnaissance vehicle, could be rigged for low-velocity airdrops from cargo aircraft. With this method the tank is pulled out of the aircraft by brake chutes and skids to a stop. The crew does not ride in the tank during extraction, but parachutes from another plane. Upon landing, they go to their tank, release the lines, and drive it away. Role The modern light tank supplements the main battle tank in expeditionary roles and situations where all major threats have been neutralized and excessive weight in armor and armament would only hinder mobility and cost more money to operate. They have also been used for reconnaissance and in some cases, infantry support.

Cantley (born February 20, 1949) is an American cell biologist and biochemist who has made significant advances to the understanding of cancer metabolism. Among his most notable contributions are the discovery and study of the enzyme PI-3-kinase, now known to be important to understanding cancer and diabetes mellitus. He is currently Meyer Director and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. He was formerly a professor in the Departments of Systems Biology and Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and the Director of Cancer Research at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, in Boston, Massachusetts. In 2016, he was elected Chairman of the Board for the Hope Funds for Cancer Research. Biography Cantley grew up in West Virginia, remaining there at Wesleyan College where he graduated summa cum laude in chemistry in 1971. Cantley obtained his PhD at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he worked with Gordon Hammes on enzyme kinetics, using FRET to study enzyme conformational changes. In 1975 he moved to Harvard University for a postdoctoral fellowship under Guido Guidotti, where he discovered that an impurity in commercial preparations of ATP, vanadate, acts as a transition state analog for phosphate hydrolysis. In 1978 Cantley became assistant professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Harvard, being promoted to associate professor in 1981. In 1985, he became a full professor in physiology at Tufts University School of Medicine. In 1985 Cantley and colleagues Malcolm Whitman, David Kaplan, Tom Roberts, and Brian Schaffhausen made the seminal discovery of the existence of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K). In 1992, Cantley moved to Harvard Medical School as a Professor of Cell Biology and the Director of the Division of Signal Transduction at the former Beth Israel Hospital (now Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center). In 2003, Cantley became a founding member of the newly formed Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School. In 2007, Cantley also became the Director of Cancer Research at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He joined the faculty of Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital in 2012.Alberta Cancer Foundation International Advisory Board Dr. Cantley was elected the Chairman of the Board of the Hope Funds for Cancer Research in 2016.http://www.newportthisweek.com/news/2017-02-09/Around_Town/New_Board_Chair_is_Appointed.html Cantley is married to Vicki Sato, herself a prominent figure in the pharmaceutical industry and a Professor at Harvard University in both the Business and Medical Schools. Research = Discovery of PI-3-kinase and PtdIns(3,4)P2Cantley, LC. \\"From Kinase to Cancer.\\" The Scientist, December 2007. = In a series of studies spanning several years, Cantley and colleagues demonstrated that a kinase activity associated with the middle T oncoprotein is a phosphoinositide kinase, that it is a novel type of phosphoinositide kinase that phosphorylates the 3' position on the inositol ring, and that this phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3-kinase) is activated by growth factors to produce novel 3'-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, in particularly PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 that had previously been identified in physiologically stimulated human neutrophils. In subsequent years Cantley and colleagues identified critical aspects of the regulation of PI-3-kinase by growth factor receptors. Specifically, they discovered that the catalytic subunit p110 dimerizes with the regulatory subunit p85, and that the SH2 domain of p85 specifically recognized phosphotyrosines on growth factor receptors or adaptor proteins via the pY-X-X-M motif. The Cantley lab has also made seminal contributions to understanding signaling downstream of PI-3-kinase. They discovered that the Pleckstrin Homology domain of AKT binds to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (and PtdIns(3,4)P2) and that this binding is critical for activation of AKT catalytic activity. They further demonstrated that tuberin/TSC2 is a critical substrate of AKT, and together with the laboratory of John Blenis they discovered that AKT phosphorylation of tuberin/TSC2 is required for activation of mTOR TORC1 kinase activity via regulation of the small GTPase rheb. The Cantley lab also was one of a few labs that nearly simultaneously identified LKB1 as a regulator of AMPK that also serves to regulate TORC1. For the discovery of PI-3-Kinase and its role in cancer metabolism, Cantley was one of eleven recipients of the inaugural Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, \\"the world's richest academic prize for medicine and biology. The prize, which carries a $3 million cash award, recognizes excellence in research aimed at curing intractable diseases and human life.\\" The fundamental and far-reaching nature of the discovery of PI-3-kinase, together with Cantley's role in mapping the upstream regulation of PI-3-kinase and the downstream signaling pathways, have led to speculation that Cantley is a likely candidate for the Nobel prize in Medicine or Physiology. The growing evidence for a primary role for PI-3-kinase in cancer and its critical role in insulin signaling have served to strengthen the significance of this fundamentally important discovery. The first drug targeting the PI-3-kinase pathway as a treatment for cancer - Idelalisib (PI3K Delta inhibitor) - was approved by the FDA as a treatment for leukemia and two types of lymphoma in July 2014. Other drugs are currently in clinical development. =Use of Oriented Peptide Libraries to determine phosphopeptide binding specificity and protein kinase substrate specificity= In 1994, the Cantley lab published a novel strategy to determine the sequence specificity of phosphopeptide binding domains (initially SH2 domains). Subsequently, the oriented peptide library approach was extended to identify the substrate specificity of protein kinases toward synthetic peptides. This approach was then extended to characterize the specificity of Ser/Thr kinases and phospho-Ser/Thr binding domains. This approach was used to characterize the substrate specificity of a large number of protein kinases. The kinase specificity matrices generated from these experiments served as the basis for creating the website Scansite, allowing the de novo identification of candidate phosphorylation sites in an arbitrary protein. In later research, the oriented peptide library approach has also been used to characterize protease cleavage specificity. Modification of the original oriented peptide approach has allowed for large scale, kinome-wide determination of protein kinase specificity. =Discovery of PtdIns(5)P= In 1997, the Cantley lab discovered that the enzymes that had been referred to as type II PIP-kinases, instead of using PtdIns(4)P as a substrate, in fact required PtdIns(5)P as a substrate to produce PtdIns(4,5)P2. Further research demonstrated that PtdIns(5)P is naturally occurring in all eukaryotes. It is remarkable that of the seven naturally occurring phosphoinositides, the existence of four of them (PtdIns(5)P, PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) was discovered by Cantley and colleagues. =Role of metabolism in cancer= The role of PI-3-kinase in anabolic signaling by insulin, IGF-1, and other growth factors makes a straightforward link between metabolism and cancer, especially in light of the discovery that the PIK3CA gene encoding PI-3-kinase is an oncogene. In recent years Cantley and colleagues have made additional links between metabolic regulation and oncogenic transformation with their discovery that the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase is associated with cancer. This discovery provides a molecular basis for understanding the Warburg effect. Cantley is now a major player in the resurgence of the importance of the Warburg effect in the process of oncogenesis. = Role of PI-3-kinase in different cancers = Cantley was part of the Stand Up to Cancer \\"dream team\\" that was brought together to investigate ways to target PI-3-kinase as a way to treat women's cancers, and he now leads a national effort targeting triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer with novel drug combinations. Recent research found that high levels of Vitamin C halted the growth of aggressive forms of colorectal tumors. His lab also elucidated the role of Nrf2 in serine production in non- small cell lung cancer, with potential implications for pancreatic and other cancers as well. Industrial activities Lewis C.

Early life Solomons is the only child of Ernest Aldrich Simpson by his third wife, Mary (née Huntemuller Kirk), formerly wife of French aviator Jacques Raffray. His father, a partner in the shipbroking firm Simpson, Spence & Young,www.ssyonline.com is now most well known for being the second husband of Wallis Simpson (who later married the former King Edward VIII, becoming the Duchess of Windsor). Solomons (Simpson by birth) was baptised at the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London. His mother died in 1941, and his father died in 1958, the same year Ernest H.C. Simpson changed his name to Aharon Solomons, his grandfather's original surname. Solomons spent his early childhood between the United Kingdom and India, then with friends of his father in Pennsylvania, United States. Returning to Britain in 1946, he was educated at Westbourne House School in Sussex, before attending Harrow School and then Le Rosey in Switzerland. Career In 1957, he was commissioned in the British Army joining his father's regiment, the Coldstream Guards, before being seconded to the Intelligence Corps and served in the Middle East. Following his father's death in 1958, he learned of his Jewish heritage and decided to move to Israel, later announcing that he had suddenly felt he belonged somewhere: \\"I had always felt neither English nor American. But I could become Israeli\\". In 1962, he emigrated to Israel joining the Israeli Army and seeing action during the Six-Day War in 1967 then on the Golan Heights front during the Yom Kippur War of 1973. In 1960 Solomons married first Joy Corisande Jackson (25 April 1932 – 22 September 2010); they had two sons, Uri (b. 1964) and Nadav (b. 1965).

Abella published a journal, We Women (Nosotras), and was a contributor to the National Feminist League journal The New Woman.  Life  Involved in the Argentine freethinking movement, in 1903 Abella supported the creation of a feminist center to facilitate discussions, later explaining her “minimum plan of female vindications” at the 1906 Freethinker Congress, arguing for equal opportunities and pay for women. She also campaigned for female divorce rights while facing opposition from the Roman Catholic Church. Even pro-divorce groups left out the female voice and body; in 1905, for instance, Oneto y Viana's proposed bill legalized divorce, but confirmed the reason as female adultery in all cases. Abella also argued that the state had no right to regulate the sex trade, which she announced in a conference in 1906: “Que la prostitución sea tolerada pero no reglamentada. La mujer soltera y mayor de edad es dueña de si misma: su cuerpo es lo que más legítimamente le corresponde: puede hacer de él lo que quiera, como el hombre, sin pagar impuestos ni sufrir vejámenes policiales.\\" [Prostitution should be tolerated but not regulated. A single adult woman is her own master; her body is what most legitimately belongs to her; she can do whatever she wants with it, just like a man, without paying taxes or being bothered by the police]. In 1907, Abella's campaign for women's rights, particularly her argument that marriage is a union of separate bodies, helped pass new divorce laws in Uruguay and set a new legal precedent throughout early 20th-century Latin America. In 1909, Abella founded the National League of Women Freethinkers with Dr. Julieta Lanteri, and in 1910 Abella founded the National Women's League in La Plata, Argentina. This organisation supported women's suffrage, and was aligned with the International Woman Suffrage Alliance.

The RNA is always found in the presumed 5' untranslated regions of genes annotated as msiK, and is therefore hypothesized to be an RNA-based cis-regulatory element that regulates these genes. MsiK, the protein encoded by msiK genes, is the ATPase subunit within certain ABC-type membrane transporter proteins. MsiK is thought to allow the import of multiple kinds of complex sugars. Based on analysis of various experimental reports, it was suggested that msiK RNAs are probably not involved in sensing glucose themselves, but are more likely a part of a feedback inhibition process to regulate levels of the MsiK protein. The msi RNA motif is a hairpin with a conserved 11-nucleotide bulge (see secondary structure), as shown in the diagram. A Shine-Dalgarno sequence (predicted ribosome-binding site) overlaps a part of the msiK RNA. If msiK RNAs are cis-regulatory elements, they likely function by sequestering the ribosome-binding site, thus preventing gene translation.

Toray Chemical Co. of Osaka, Japan, acquired the process and the rights to make Taklon, which was originally designed to mimic the handling characteristics of natural sable. Use in makeup brushes Taklon brushes are more hygienic than real hair brushes. Natural hair has an irregular surface which traps powders, dead skin cells, bacteria and chemicals. Cleaning may not necessarily remove these particles. Because of this, regular cleaning with disinfectants is required to prevent skin irritation. Taklon lacks these surface irregularities, making it easier to clean properly. This decreases irritation.

Its main focus is the former Rossie Velvet Mill, a large brick industrial facility on the east side of Greenmanville Avenue that is now a research center for the nearby Mystic Seaport Museum. The district extends along Greenmanville Avenue between Pleasant Street in the north and the museum complex in the south. Most of the buildings in the district are residential housing built to house workers at the mill, and were built between about 1850 and 1950. The district includes 51 properties in . The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 9, 2007. The area that houses the Rossie Velvet Mill was primarily agricultural until the mid 19th Century, with its farmers providing goods to the shipbuilders and other businesses in Mystic. A small textile mill began operation on the bank of the Mystic River in 1850, on what are now the grounds of the museum, precipitating development as a modestly scaled industrial area. In 1897, the Rossie Velvet Mill was established spurred on by two factors: first, a local business development group recruited velvet makers from Germany to the area, repeating a success in Stonington village, and second, the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which encouraged the owners of a velvet mill in Süchteln (northwestern Germany) to relocate to the United States and open a manufacturing facility to avoid the tariff. This business was a major local success, employing 200 workers (including a significant number of experienced German immigrant weavers) at what was the village's largest employer. The Rossie operation failed during the Great Depression, but the plant was soon operating again under different ownership. Finally, the mill permanently closed in 1958.

The Corsican mafia is an influential organized crime structure, operating in France, Russia, and many African and Latin American countries. The most important groups of the Corsican mafia include the Unione Corse and the Brise de Mer gang. History =The Union Corse and the French Connection era= The pre-war crime kings of Marseille, Paul Carbone and François Spirito, sided with Vichy and the Germans. During World War II, the Corsican gang led by the Guerini brothers (Antoine and Barthélémy, nicknamed \\"Mémé\\") sided with the Gaullist part of the French Resistance. In 1947, Marseille was the main trading port of the French colonial empire and it had a communist mayor, Jean Christofol, who was backed by the trade unions, popular among longshoremen, transportation workers, and dockworkers. In the coming Cold War (1947–53), both the center-left French government and the US tried to fight communist influence in Marseille while occasionally employing illegal means to further their goal: the Guerini gang was employed to disrupt union and electoral gatherings, back strikebreakers and support US-funded non- communist trade unions. From the 1950s to the 1960s, the Guerini brothers were exempt from prosecution in Marseille. The Guerini brothers trafficked opium derivatives illegally imported from French Indochina using the services of the Messageries Maritimes, a French merchant shipping company. From the 1960s to the early 1970s the major Corsican gangs called Union Corse by American authorities organized the French Connection, a heroin trade between France and the United States. =The Corsican mafia today= The end of the French Connection caused the disbandment of Corsican clans involved in the heroin trade. However, the evolution of the Corsican Mafia has continued in several illegal activities (hold-ups, racketeering, casinos, illegal slot machines, various drug dealing and prostitution). From the 1980s to the end of the 2000s, the Corsican mafia was split into two major groups; the Brise de Mer, based in Northern Corsica, and the Colonna clan (also named \\"Jean Jé Colonna's family\\"), based in Southern Corsica. A violent internal conflict troubled the Corsican mafia in 2007, resulting in around 102 murders on the island of Corsica. This conflict caused the fall of these two groups and the rise of new Corsican gangs. Today, the Corsican mafia consists of multiple families, allies, and rivals. Known groups in the Corsican mafia are the Venzolasca gang (nickname in reference to the village of Venzolasca, in northern Corsica, which are from key members of the gang), considered the Brise de Mer successors. The \\"Petit Bar\\" gang (also called the \\"Tiny Bar\\"), the Valinco mobsters, and the Corsican mob of Marseille are also active.

Built about 1771 for a local physician and politician, it is a fine example of late Georgian architecture. It has been moved twice, both times short distances, and now serves as a bed and breakfast inn. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 12, 1979. Description and history The Whitehall Mansion is located in a commercially built-up area in Mystic just north of Interstate 95, on the east side of Whitehall Avenue (Connecticut Route 27) in front of a modern hotel that has been built on the back of its property. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof, large central chimney, and a shingled exterior. Its main facade faces west, and is five bays wide, with the center entrance framed by pilasters and a corniced entablature. Unusual features include the use of brick instead of stone on part of the chimney inside the house, and the use of brick as nogging (fill and insulation) in the walls. The interior follows a typical central chimney plan, with a narrow entrance vestibule that also houses a winding staircase, parlor chambers to either side of the chimney, and the kitchen extending across much of the rear. There are small chambers in the rear corners on either side of the kitchen. The floor plan of the second floor is similar. The house was built in the 1770s by Dudley Woodbridge, a doctor in Mystic who also represented Groton in the state legislature. In 1962, the house was donated to the Stoningham Historical Society, its original location threatened by the construction of nearby Interstate 95. The house was carefully moved to a new site just across the street. In 1993, the Stonington Historical Society sought permission to relocate the house forward on its lot so that it would attract more attention. The Stonington Historical Society had decided that it could not afford to continue operating the house as a museum, but its location on the rear of the lot was seen as an obstacle to its sale. The request was approved on March 2, 1994. The house is now operated as a bed and breakfast inn.

In knot theory, a branch of mathematics, a twist knot is a knot obtained by repeatedly twisting a closed loop and then linking the ends together. (That is, a twist knot is any Whitehead double of an unknot.) The twist knots are an infinite family of knots, and are considered the simplest type of knots after the torus knots. Construction A twist knot is obtained by linking together the two ends of a twisted loop. Any number of half-twists may be introduced into the loop before linking, resulting in an infinite family of possibilities. The following figures show the first few twist knots: Image:One-Twist Trefoil.pngOne half-twist (trefoil knot, 31) Image:Blue Figure-Eight Knot.pngTwo half-twists (figure-eight knot, 41) Image:Blue Three-Twist Knot.pngThree half-twists (52 knot) Image:Blue Stevedore Knot.pngFour half-twists (stevedore knot, 61) Image:Blue 7_2 Knot.pngFive half-twists (72 knot) Image:Blue 8_1 Knot.pngSix half-twists (81 knot) Properties The four half-twist stevedore knot is created by passing the one end of an unknot with four half-twists through the other. All twist knots have unknotting number one, since the knot can be untied by unlinking the two ends. Every twist knot is also a 2-bridge knot. Of the twist knots, only the unknot and the stevedore knot are slice knots. A twist knot with n half-twists has crossing number n+2. All twist knots are invertible, but the only amphichiral twist knots are the unknot and the figure-eight knot. Invariants The invariants of a twist knot depend on the number n of half- twists. The Alexander polynomial of a twist knot is given by the formula :\\\\Delta(t) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{n+1}{2}t - n + \\\\frac{n+1}{2}t^{-1} & \\\\text{if }n\\\\text{ is odd}  -\\\\frac{n}{2}t + (n+1) - \\\\frac{n}{2}t^{-1} & \\\\text{if }n\\\\text{ is even,}  \\\\end{cases} and the Conway polynomial is : abla(z) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{n+1}{2}z^2 + 1 & \\\\text{if }n\\\\text{ is odd}  1 - \\\\frac{n}{2}z^2 & \\\\text{if }n\\\\text{ is even.}  \\\\end{cases} When n is odd, the Jones polynomial is :V(q) = \\\\frac{1 + q^{-2} + q^{-n} - q^{-n-3}}{q+1}, and when n is even, it is :V(q) = \\\\frac{q^3 + q - q^{3-n} + q^{-n}}{q+1}.

The district has an inverted U-shape formed by Thames, Broad, and Monument Streets, and its boundaries are based on an 1868 map to include an area developed mostly during 1820–1860, reflecting a period of growth when Groton was a significant whaling and shipbuilding center. Groton was settled by English colonists in the mid-17th century, but it has few remaining colonial-era structures, since many were destroyed during the Battle of Groton Heights in the American Revolutionary War. A number of post-independence 18th-century houses survive, including the Major Noyes Barber house, built in 1810, which is a Federal style structure. The district contains a cross-section of architectural styles from its periods of growth. The Groton Heights Baptist Church was built in 1878 and is an example of Italianate architecture, and the Thomas Miner House on Monument Street, built about 1894, is an example of Queen Anne architecture.

Between 1976 and enactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), studies at the Hanford site continued to evaluate the geologic and hydrologic suitability of the BWIP repository in the underlying basalt. The BWIP Site Characterization Report was published in November 1982, explaining the details and status of the project. When the Department of Energy (DOE) published an Environmental Assessment in May 1986, it recommended BWIP to the President as a candidate site. The main concern in the post-1982 phase of the project had been the suitability of the project's quality assurance procedures during the early phases of BWIP. President Reagan approved BWIP as a candidate site in May 1986, and DOE stopped most of the site characterization activities at the BWIP until quality assurance procedures could be adopted that would satisfy Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requirements. BWIP's status as a candidate site was short lived. Only 19 months after the President approved the BWIP as a candidate site for the repository, Congress amended the NWPA in Title V of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987. This narrowed the search for a repository site by designating Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate. DOE was directed to terminate all BWIP activities within 90 days after December 22, 1987.

The creation of universal academic standards requires agreement on rubrics, criteria or other systems of coding academic achievement. At colleges and universities, faculty are under increasing pressure from administrators to award students good marks and grades without regard for those students' actual abilities, both to keep those students in school paying tuition and to boost the schools' graduation rates. Students often use course evaluations to criticize any instructor who they feel has been making the course too difficult, even if an objective evaluation would show that the course has been too easy. It is very difficult to find a direct correlation between the quality of the course and the outcome of the course evaluations. Assessment Student evaluations are a controversial method of assessing academic achievement. Recent studies have correlated high student evaluation of instructors with high grades rather than mastery of content. Studies have also noted that students' understanding of assessment criteria can lead to enhanced learning experiences.  Globalization and academic standards  According to a 2009 report by UNESCO, changes in the university structure in the late 20th and early 21st century have led to increasing access to or \\"massification\\" of higher education which has, in turn, resulted in both a diversification of the student population but also a general decrease in academic standards globally.Altbach, Phillip G., Liz Reisberg, and Laura E. Rumbley, \\"Trends in Global Higher Education: Tracking an Academic Revolution. A Report Prepared for the UNESCO 2009 World Conference on Higher Education\\" (France, UNESCO, 2009). http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30910755/Altbach__Reisberg__Rumbley_Tracking_an_Academic_Revolution__UNESCO_2009.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires;=1494895733&Signature;=8P%2F9h78kTqQbTaKmy9VKiHaIwoc%3D&response- content- disposition;=inline%3B%20filename%3DTrends_in_global_higher_education_Tracki.pdf UK In the UK, degree awarding bodies themselves are responsible for standards in higher education, but these are checked during inspection by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) and the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual). On its website QAA defines academic standards as 'The standards set and maintained by institutions for their courses (programmes and modules) and expected for their awards.' The Dearing Report recommended in 1997 that benchmarking be used to measure and improve academic standards. From 1997 to 2011 this was done by code of practice and other guidelines known as the Academic Infrastructure. During 2012-13, this was replaced by the Quality Code for Higher Education, which included points about the availability of information about the learning experience to emphasize the role of the student as a paying customer of the institutions. USA In the USA, regulation is at state level by bodies such as the Standards and Assessment Division of the Arizona Department of Education.  Types of academic standards  The Common Core is a group of academic standards which focus on two main subjects: mathematics and English language arts (ELA). These standards are intended to ensure mastery of information and prepare students for entry into the next grade and beyond. The core originated as a way to standardize the way students were taught from state-to-state, and also the quality of information students received. The Common Core has now been adopted by 42 states in the US. The Common Core standards are: * Research- and evidence-based * Clear, understandable, and consistent * Aligned with college and career expectations * Based on rigorous and application of knowledge through higher order thinking skills * Built upon the strengths and lessons of current state standards * Informed by other top performing countries in order to prepare all students for success in our global economy and society See also * Academic achievement References ","title":"Academic standards"},{"id":"26701495","text":"U.S. Life-Saving Station No. 35 is located in Stone Harbor, Cape May County, New Jersey, United States.

The season was directed by Pamela Fryman and produced by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television. It consists of 22 episodes, each running approximately 22 minutes in length. The season introduces Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) in the year 2030 as he sits his daughter and son down to tell them the story of how he met their mother. The story begins in 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living in Manhattan with his two best friends from college: Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris). Ted begins his search for his perfect mate and meets an ambitious young reporter, Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), whom he quickly falls in love with. Robin, however, doesn't want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. However, Robin begins to develop feelings for Ted while he begins dating a baker, Victoria, but when she moves to Germany for a culinary fellowship, Ted leads Robin to believe that she broke up with him. As a result, Victoria breaks up with Ted and Robin begins to distance herself from him, though they eventually reconcile. As her wedding date approaches, Lily begins to wonder if she's missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall and decides to pursue an art fellowship in San Francisco, breaking her engagement in the process. At the end of the season, Marshall is seen looking desolate and miserable, while Ted and Robin agree to pursue a relationship. The season was met with mixed reviews. On the review aggregation site, Rotten Tomatoes reported that 63% of 16 critics gave the show a positive review. Despite the mixed reviews, the show appeared on several television best lists, including Time Magazine and Chicago Tribune. The first season garnered an average of 9.47 million viewers per all 22 episodes in the U.S. Out of all regular primetime programming that aired during the 2005–2006 American television season, How I Met Your Mother ranked 51st out of 156, according to the Nielsen ratings system. The pilot was watched by 10.94 million viewers, while the finale was watched by 8.64 million viewers. Casting The first season features a cast of five actors who receive star billing. Josh Radnor portrays Ted, a young architect who is searching for his future wife. Jason Segel and Alyson Hannigan portray Marshall Eriksen and Lily Aldrin, respectively, a newly engaged couple. Cobie Smulders plays Robin Scherbatsky, an ambitious reporter whom Ted falls for. Barney Stinson, Ted's self-appointed best friend and a womanizer, is played by Neil Patrick Harris. Season one also introduced several recurring cast members, including Lyndsy Fonseca and David Henrie as Ted's children, and Ashley Williams as Victoria, Ted's love interest for the second half of the season. The season one pilot episode was recognized by the Casting Society of America with a nomination for the Best Comedy Pilot Casting Artios Award. How I Met Your Mother was inspired by creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas's idea to \\"write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York,\\" where they previously worked as writers for Late Show with David Letterman. The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife. Thomas's wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her, but agreed if they could get Hannigan to play her. Radnor and Segel were relative unknowns, but Smulders, another relatively little-known actress, was cast as Robin after Jennifer Love Hewitt turned down the role in favor of Ghost Whisperer. Bays and Thomas commented on her casting by saying, \\"thank God we did for a million reasons... when Ted’s seeing her for the first time, America’s seeing her for the first time — the intriguingness of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive\\". The role of Barney was initially envisioned as a \\"John Belushi-type character\\" before Neil Patrick Harris won the role after being invited to an audition by the show's casting director Megan Branman. Harris's character was widely reported to be the breakout character, with Variety calling him \\"the major breakout\\" and Boston.com noting that his character was the \\"most buzzed about element of the show\\". Robert Bianco from USA Today observed that Harris \\"sparkled\\" in his role, and further praised Hannigan's performance as equally \\"delightful\\" as her role in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. =Main cast= * Josh Radnor as Ted Mosby * Jason Segel as Marshall Eriksen * Cobie Smulders as Robin Scherbatsky * Neil Patrick Harris as Barney Stinson * Alyson Hannigan as Lily Aldrin * Bob Saget (uncredited) as Future Ted Mosby (voice only) =Recurring cast= * Lyndsy Fonseca as Penny (Future daughter) * David Henrie as Luke (Future son) * Ashley Williams as Victoria * Joe Nieves as Carl * Alexis Denisof as Sandy Rivers * Marshall Manesh as Ranjit * Charlene Amoia as Wendy the Waitress =Guest cast= *Virginia Williams as Claudia *Kelly Stables as Masseuse Release =Critical reception= Season one of How I Met Your Mother received mixed reviews from television critics. Metacritic, a review aggregation site that collects critical opinions, gave the first season a score of 69 out of 25 reviews collected, signifying \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Many critics compared the show to the recently concluded sitcom Friends, with some calling it a \\"worthy successor\\" and others a \\"well- executed...rip-off\\". Including it on his annual \\"Best of Television\\" list, James Poniewozik of Time observed that \\"just a few episodes into the show's run, the writers know these characters inside and out\\". However, Poniewozik derided the premise of the show, Future Ted's narration, as a \\"gimmicky distraction\\". Hal Boedeker of The Orlando Sentinel disagreed, saying that \\"the twist should keep viewers coming back\\" and praises the five leads as \\"irresistible\\". The A.V. Club also called the premise \\"a winner\\" and the actors \\"appealing\\", but complained that the show stuck too closely to standard sitcom one-liners, as did Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times, who disparaged the script as little more than a series of \\"cheap jokes\\". Robert Bianco from USA Today was more upbeat, praising the \\"fine cast\\" and \\"humorous script\\", and calling the show the \\"most inventive\\" of new series that year. The New York Times said that the show was \\"pleasant to watch\\" has \\"potential to improve\\", but will not \\"revolutionize\\" sitcoms or start a pop culture phenomenon. Charlie McCollum of The San Jose Mercury News writes that How I Met Your Mother was a prime candidate for replacing Friends in the sitcom category, praising the show as \\"something with real wit and considerable charm\\". He praised the writers for \\"giving a fresh spin to bits and pieces of the sitcom formula\\" and the cast for \\"hitting on all cylinders from the very first scene\\", predicting that the show could be an unexpected creative breakout with audiences. =Awards= The first season was nominated for four awards, winning two. Both wins were from the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards, where the show won the Outstanding Art Direction for a Multi-Camera Series and the Outstanding Cinematography for a Multi-Camera Series categories. In addition, the show was nominated for the People's Choice Awards for Favorite New Television Comedy and was recognized by the Casting Society of America for Best Comedy Pilot Casting. =Distribution= CBS premiered the show in the United States on September 19, 2005. Internationally, the show premiered in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on May 7, 2006, and is aired by Citytv in Canada and Seven Network in Australia. Season one also runs in syndication in the United States. The first season was released on DVD in the U.S. under the name How I Met Your Mother Season One with the tagline \\"A Love Story in Reverse\\" on November 21, 2006 as a three-disc box set. The DVD cropped the original widescreen broadcast to a full frame 4:3 format, and no widescreen format has been released. The set was released in Region 2 on May 7, 2007 and Region 4 on January 10, 2007.

The parish is home to almost 18,000 people. It is notable in part as it is one of the most passed churches in Manchester as it is on the entry to Manchester on the A5013 (Princess Parkway). Thousands of motorists pass its stone tower every day. History The Church was built in 1881 as a gift to the community from Mr. William Roberts of Darleydale and cost £13,000. The architect was Henry Littler. It was, for many years, known as 'Christ Church-in-the-fields' due to its placement in a semi-rural setting; it is now in a suburban area. Between 1979 and 1981 the church was closed due to major extension of Princess Parkway and during this time the church was completely reordered and redecorated. The west entrance was sealed off and a new east entrance was created into what was the organ chamber. The old Jardine organ was disposed of and a redundant organ was purchased and rebuilt in a new case at the west end. In December 2006 Christ Church joined forces with St. Christopher’s Church in Withington and became a single parish. The current Rector is Anne Pilkington who came to the church from William Temple Church in Wythenshawe. Concert venue and organ Looking west from the quire Christ Church is a venue for concerts due to its excellent acoustics (especially for chamber music) and flexible interior. It is the regular 'home' of the Manchester Chamber Choir and The William Byrd Singers of Manchester. The church has a pipe organ of 42 speaking stops based on by JJ Binns of Leeds. It was brought to Christ Church in 1981 and rebuilt and enlarged in a new case at the West end. More recently (2013), the organ has been rebuilt by A. J. Carter of Wakefield. Changes included new digital combination and transmission systems along with repairs to the wind system. There is also a 2-manual Viscount Physis organ in the chancel which is used for choral accompaniment and can also operate the west-end organ via a midi link.

He belonged to the Phagmodrupa Dynasty which held power in Tibet or parts of it from 1354 to the early 17th century. Due to the internal family feuds that preceded his reign most of the powers of his predecessor slipped from his hands.Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan Painted Scrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. I, pp. 44–5. Rising against his grandfather Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen was the son of Drowai Gonpo (1508–1548), a sub-ruler who resided in Gongri Karpo to the south-west of Lhasa. His grandfather was Ngawang Tashi Drakpa (1488–1564), the last effective king of the Phagmodrupa line. The main palace of the dynasty was Nêdong southeast of Lhasa. In 1554 Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen temporarily took over the throne of his old grandfather, when the latter was forced to step down for a while.Per K. Sorensen & Guntram Hazod, Rulers on the Celestial Plain. Wien 2007, p. 516. However, new turmoil broke out in Central Tibet in 1555. A council was headed by the religious hierarchs of Drigung Kagyu and Shamarpa, and it was decided to put the old ex-king back on the throne. Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen had to return to Gongri Karpo.Olaf Czaja, Medieval rule in Tibet, Vol. I. Wien 2013, p. 271. Some years later he rose against the 75-year-old ruler and tried to acquire the throne permanently. He was aided in his ambitions by the ruler of Ganden. He also kept good relations with Sonam Gyatso, later known as the Third Dalai Lama. A number of Buddhist dignitaries tried to intervene in the rebellion, to no avail. In the next year 1564, his grandfather died. New disturbances broke out between the Nêdong and Gongri Karpo branches of the dynasty. Sonam Gyatso was asked to mediate in the conflict. Eventually Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen became the new gongma or king in 1576. However, the executive authority of the Phagmodrupa was now almost depleted.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. I, p. 45. Nevertheless, the Phagmodrupa still filled a role as a focal point around which politics in Ü (East Central Tibet) revolved and different groups balanced each other. Conditions in this part of Tibet tended to be relatively peaceful in the decades of the late sixteenth century, and relations between the main religious sects Karmapa and Gelugpa were amiable for the moment.Olaf Czaja, 2013, p. 291–2. Contacts with Altan Khan The Chinese dynastic annals, the Mingshi, assert that a new Phagmodrupa ruler sought investiture from the Emperor in 1564, but in fact China had very little interest in Tibet at this time. According to the Mingshi a certain Phagmodrupa ruler called Tashi Zangpo ruled after 1579.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. II, p. 693. However, indigenous Tibetan sourced indicate that Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen reigned from 1576 until his death in 1603 or 1604. The Chinese might have been ill-informed about local affairs. On the other hand, there was an intense interest from the Tümed Mongols to make contact with the religious leaders of Central Tibet. In 1577 envoys from the Tümed leader Altan Khan arrived to Sonam Gyatso, with an invitation to visit him in Kokonor. Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen was supportive of the project, and sent representatives to accompany Sonam Gyatso on his journey.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, Tibet. A Political History. Yale 1967, p. 93. The result of the visit was that the Gelugpa sect established lasting relations with the Mongols, and that their leader acquired the title Dalai Lama. Relations with Dalai Lama and demise Although the Phagmodrupa led a Kagyu school of Buddhism, Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen supported Sonam Gyatso and the Gelugpa. The Fifth Dalai Lama (1617–1682) wrote enthusiastically in his chronicles about the gongma: \\"He was particularly a devotee both of the Gelugpa and of the Drukpa and heard [from them] many holy teachings. As his thoughts had been purified, because he was bound to the omniscient Sonam Gyatso by the links which pass between a chaplain and a giver of oblations, similar to those uniting the moon and the sun, the Chinese Emperor's court was constantly sending offerings to Gong[ri] Kar[po].\\"Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. II, p. 641. In 1601 the Phagmodrupa sent a representative with a delegation of Gelugpa dignitaries that journeyed to Mongolia. The delegation received the young Fourth Dalai Lama, Yonten Gyatso, who was a Mongol prince, and brought him to Tibet.David Snellgrove & Hugh Richardson, A Cultural History of Tibet. New York 1968, pp. 184–93. Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen died a few years later, in late 1603 or early 1604. He had two sons called Kagyud Nampar Gyalwa (d. 1623) and Namgyal Drakpa (d. 1590). However, for unknown reasons a scion of the rival Kyormolung line of the dynasty took over the by now insignificant title. This was Mipham Wanggyur Gyalpo, possibly a grandson of his half-brother Namgyal Rabten.Olaf Czaja, 2013, p. 460, 562.

It originally aired on ABC on March 24, 2010. The episode was written by Danny Zuker and directed by Jason Winer. In the episode, Claire and Phil take rival approaches to keeping Haley and Luke focused on projects that are due the next day. Manny's ribbing of Mitchell during a trip with Jay causes tension between the three. Cameron tries to make amends with Gloria for past awkward encounters with a night out in her old neighborhood. The episode received positive reviews and was viewed by 9.05 million viewers with an 18-49 Nielsen Rating of 3.6. Plot In the Dunphy household, Luke (Nolan Gould) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) both have projects due and Claire (Julie Bowen) and Phil (Ty Burrell) are responsible for ensuring their children get their work done on time. Claire gives Phil the task of making sure Luke completes a project covering Van Gogh while she keeps track of Haley as she has to cook cupcakes for a fund-raiser. While Phil demonstrates his ADHD (narrated in voice-over as Alex (Ariel Winter) tries to convince her mother Luke suffers from the condition), Luke surpasses his mother's low expectations and completes the project. Meanwhile, Haley manipulates her mother into making the cupcakes for her - only to have Claire throw away all the cupcakes after she is shocked with Luke's success. Luke recites his planned presentation speech to Alex, who is impressed until Luke begins talking about how Van Gogh was warning us of aliens about to attack and Alex calls for her mom. Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) hangs out with Jay (Ed O'Neill) and Manny (Rico Rodriguez) while Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) hangs out with Gloria (Sofía Vergara). Mitchell and Jay have a tradition of watching meteor showers together and Jay brings along Manny to get him out of the house. Cameron attempts to make up for slight offenses over the past couple of weeks with Gloria by inviting her to a fancy restaurant. Jay and Manny tease Mitchell during the stargazing; Jay is trying to get Manny to overcome a severe disappointment earlier in the week and encourages him to treat Mitchell as a brother would - teasing, joking, camaraderie. Jay asks Mitchell to encourage Manny to not focus on other children calling him \\"weird\\" and the two bond. At the same time, Cameron takes Gloria to one of her favorite little eateries, where he tries to bond by eating very spicy food, to which he has a bad reaction. The two end up finding their similarities lie in fashion, shopping and things of that nature. At the close, the family tries cupcakes that Haley has managed to cook while they celebrated Luke's success.

Life He was chaplain to King Henry II of England and on his \\"urgent\\" recommendation was elected Archbishop of Dublin following the death of St. Laurence O'Toole in 1180.John D'Alton: Memoirs of the Archbishops of Dublin. Hodges and Smith, 1838 He had been a Benedictine monk at the Evesham Abbey. In 1181, he was elected to the archbishopric of Dublin by some of the clergy of Dublin, who had assembled at Evesham for the purpose. He was not then a priest, but was subsequently, in the same year, ordained such, at Velletri, and on Palm Sunday (21 March) was there consecrated archbishop by Pope Lucius III. The following year the pope granted him manors and lands in and around Dublin, which subsequently formed the Manor of St. Sepulchre, which remained under the authority of the Archbishop of Dublin until the 19th century. The pope also, in an effort to protect the Dublin archbishopric from claims from Canterbury, extended certain privileges to Comyn, which intensified the rivalry between the sees of Dublin and Armagh for the Primacy of Ireland. Comyn waited three years before visiting Ireland, until he was sent there by King Henry to prepare the reception of his son, Prince John. The king granted him lands and privileges which made him a Lord of Parliament. After his arrival in Ireland John granted Comyn the Bishopric of Glendalough, with all its appurtenances in lands, manors, churches, tithes, fisheries and liberties, although Comyn never had an opportunity to take this up in his lifetime. Under Pope Urban III carried out a number of reforms of the Irish church to bring it into line with the church in England and in continental Europe. In 1189, Archbishop Comyn assisted at the coronation of King Richard I. The following year he demolished the old parish church of St. Patrick, south of Dublin, and erected a new building, next to his Palace of St. Sepulchre, which he elevated to the status of a collegiate church, and which later became St. Patrick's Cathedral. This enabled him to rule in his own Liberty, without the interference of mayor and citizens. About the same time he enlarged the choir of Christ Church Cathedral.Miles V. Ronan: The Reformation in Dublin. London. Longmans, Green & Co, 1926. p. 241 Prince John granted Comyn further legal rights throughout the country of Ireland, while Comyn also received the church and lands of All Hallows, to the north-east of Dublin. Between Lusk and Swords he founded the convent of Grace Dieu, which later became wealthy through grants from the Anglo-Norman prelates and magnates. However, when Hamo de Valoniis (alias de Valois), was appointed Justiciar of Ireland he seized some of these lands for the treasury (with a good portion for himself), and a dispute arose which caused Comyn to flee for his own safety to Normandy. Comyn appealed to Pope Innocent III, who settled the dispute, but John was angered by the actions of Comyn, and did not reconcile himself with him until 1206. Comyn died six years later and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, where a marble monument was erected to his memory. Two years later William Piro, Bishop of Glendalough, died, whereupon the union of the sees granted by King John took place.

In her later years, the run was shortened to a turnaround in Poughkeepsie. The steamer was built by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation in 1924.

She was over 300 feet in length and was built to handle more than 3,000 passengers. Her replacement was the passenger vessel Dayliner, which took over the run. Alexander Hamilton spent time at the South Street Seaport and Brooklyn Navy Yard before being moved to Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey.

Gaer Penrhôs commands a view into the mountains of the Ystwyth Valley and over Cardigan Bay. The ringwork consists of a small courtyard enclosed by a large rampart and outer ditch, however it lines up with the remains of what appears to have been a much larger enclosure that could have formed the basis of a much older Roman-era hillfort (which is usually referred to as Caer Penrhos in modern sources). According to the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, a ring motte was first erected by Richard de la Mare in around 1110; just six years later it was captured by Gruffydd ap Rhys, and destroyed by Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd in 1136, who built a new castle on basically the same site in 1149. In 1150, a dispute between Cadwaladr's brother Owain Gwynedd and his nephew Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd, Owain's son, erupted and Hywel seized Gaer Penrhôs for himself. Hywel was only able to retain control of the castle for a year, losing it to Rhys ap Gruffydd and his brothers. The castle hadn't seen the last of Hywel, however; he returned some months later, where he slaughtered the castle's garrison and destroyed its timber defenses. In 1158 what appears to be a new structure was captured by Normans, but that was likely burned to the ground again when Rhys returned later to scourge every English-controlled castle in Ceredigion.

The title of the work is derived from the \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech that Martin Luther King, Jr. made in Washington, D.C. during the August 1963 civil rights march, and the libretto is based on statements and writings by King. Furman described I Have a Dream as \\"an oratorio in symphonic form which conveys some of the basic concerns of today's world. These concerns are dramatized within a thirty-five minute musical journey focusing upon human dignity, love, hate, the tragedy of war, peace, beauty, poverty, and the hope for genuine freedom.\\" The composer points out that \\"each group, representing a segment of society, speaks as an individual and in conjunction with other groups.\\" The work is in three parts. The musical style is varied, ranging from jungle rhythms to passages of contemporary serial and rock music. Igbo phrases are chanted in the final section of Part I and combined with English words in the coda of Part III. The climax of Part III is an elaborate interweaving of hymnss, spirituals, and patriotic songs. Despite its variety in mood and orchestration, the composer says that he aimed at an overall effect of childlike simplicity and innocence. History I Have a Dream was commissioned by the Greenwich Choral Society in 1970 to commemorate its 45th anniversary. The premiere of the first version took place in Greenwich, Connecticut, on April 19, 1970, performed by the Greenwich Choral Society and conducted by the composer. The second performance was also in 1970, at Lincoln Center in New York City, by the Symphony of the New World conducted by Benjamin Steinberg. After this, the score was considerably revised. The new version had its world premiere on January 22 and 23, 1971 (the composer's birthday) with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in Cincinnati, Ohio. Neither version was ever published. After the composer's death in 1989, the 1971 score and parts were sent to Morgan State University as stipulated in his will. A small group of Furman's students have been working to locate the score so the piece can be performed once again, but efforts have been unsuccessful. Sections (revised Igbo version) =1. \\"The River of Life\\"= The section opens with an instrumental passage with drums, suggestive of an African procession, and continues with baritone soloist and chorus, ending with the Igbo phrase \\"Makanjo amemeliezindu. Aa-ya.\\" (Evil shall not overcome good. Amen.) and a slow crescendo ending in a loud yell. =2. \\"I've Been to the Mountain Top\\"= A monologue in largo tempo in the setting of a church meeting, perhaps a revival, featuring phrases from several well-known hymns and the hymn \\"I Have a Dream\\". =3. \\"Let Freedom Ring\\"= A multi-part section featuring gospel piano, guitar, and banjo, with the gospel chorus playing tambourines, followed by the \\"Poor People's March\\", introduced by the orchestra and featuring the rock combo. The section uses both textual and musical symbolism: the orchestra plays \\"America the Beautiful\\", the gospel chorus sings the opening lines of \\"America\\", and at one point a solo violin plays a square dance theme. The final sub-section, with the theme \\"Free at Last!\\", integrates gospel, full orchestra, and motifs from the opening Africa- themed section, as well as combining Igbo with English. The celesta accompanies the final words, \\"We are free at last!\\", and the work ends with orchestral bells and gently plucked violins.

Curtis writes that free speech rights were first developed in \\"the forum of public opinion\\", and that, \\"The history of free speech shows the need for broadly protective free speech rules applied generally and equally\\". For his work on Free Speech, \\"The People's Darling Privilege\\", Curtis received the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award and the Mayflower Cup Award. Critics gave the book a positive reception. A review in Columbia Journalism Review called it a \\"rich and original study\\", and The Journal of American History said that it includes \\"fine analytic discussions\\". Perspectives on Political Science called the book \\"an extremely valuable contribution to the literature addressing the history of free speech in America.\\" Timothy C. Shiell of the University of Wisconsin–Stout reviewed it for The Historian and wrote, \\"Michael Kent Curtis offers a major contribution to the scholarship of both that era and of free speech.\\" Author Curtis' previous book, No State Shall Abridge: The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights, was published in 1986. The Journal of Information Ethics said that before the book's publication, Curtis had \\"written quite extensively on the subject\\" of freedom of speech, and cited articles in Constitutional Commentary (1995), and Wake Forest Law Review (1996). With J. Wilson Parker, Davison Douglas, and Paul Finkelman, Curtis served as editor of the 2003 work, Constitutional Law in Context. In 2002, Curtis was a professor of law at Wake Forest University, where he taught American legal and constitutional history, free speech law, and constitutional law. In 2004, Curtis was a professor of Public and Constitutional Law at Wake Forest University. Contents Structured in chronological order, Free Speech, \\"The People's Darling Privilege\\" discusses the development of free speech through controversies which arose during the history of the United States. These include the Quasi-War with France, the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts, conflict regarding speech related to abolitionism and criticism of slavery, and speech related to criticism of the American Civil War. Curtis discusses the efforts of abolitionists Elijah Lovejoy and Hinton Helper. The book discusses in detail attempts by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln to curtail free speech during the American Civil War. He comments on the ways attitudes about free speech affected events in history related to this period of time, \\"The weakness of the popular free-speech tradition (especially in the South) encouraged violence that did not end with the Civil War ... [but was] revived during Reconstruction to silence those who supported civil and political rights for blacks\\". Curtis discusses conflict involving people related to these historical events, including editors, political activists, and politicians. The author discusses advocates of free speech before the recognition of this right in the U.S. court system. Curtis writes that despite the actions of the government, it is the actions of individuals through speech and protest that allow democracy to function appropriately. The author states that, \\"again and again, people in power have treated speech that advocated lawful change through democratic process as an incitement to lawless action\\". Curtis says that free speech rights in the U.S., which at present are believed to be given through 20th century court rulings, were actually developed first in \\"the forum of public opinion\\". He says, \\"The history of free speech shows the need for broadly protective free speech rules applied generally and equally\\". He writes that during the 18th and 19th centuries in the U.S., protests by individuals and the press predated court judgments regarding the development of free speech. The author says, \\"as Madison had expected, constitutional guarantees of liberty do their work at popular levels as well as at the level of institutions such as the Supreme Court of the United States, state supreme courts, Congress, and state legislatures. Popular views limit and channel both legislation and private action, each of which can either constrain or empower speech\\". Curtis says that, \\"The similarity of current suppression theories to those of the past suggests caution. Historic attempts to use these ideas to suppress democratic discussion of positive social change should make us wary of attempts to resurrect them for benevolent purposes\\". Reception =Awards and honors= For his work on the book, Michael Kent Curtis was recognized with the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award, which recognizes contributions to the First Amendment. He also received the Mayflower Cup Award, which honors the best non-fiction work by an individual from North Carolina, from the North Carolina Literary and Historical Association. =Reviews= In a review of the book for the Columbia Journalism Review, James Boylan said Curtis' work is a \\"rich and original study\\". Reviewing the book for The Journal of American History, Michael P. Zuckert called it a \\"very fine book\\" that is \\"gracefully written and engaging to read\\". He said, \\"After Curtis's book, nobody should be able to say that the Bill of Rights was unlikely to be on the minds of the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\" Zuckert wrote, \\"Sprinkled into the stories are fine analytic discussions.\\" Writing in Perspectives on Political Science, Paul Weizer described the book as \\"an extremely valuable contribution to the literature addressing the history of free speech in America.\\" Weizer said, \\"Although there are countless books on the theories behind the speech guarantee embedded in our Constitution, Curtis brings a fresh perspective. Most First Amendment books begin with Supreme Court decisions from the early 1900s; Curtis reminds us that modern ideas about the protection of expression originated much earlier.\\" As to the writing quality of the book, Weizer wrote, \\"The first hundred years of American history are rich with stories such as this. Curtis does an outstanding job of bringing them to life. He is to be commended for keeping editorial comments to a minimum and allowing the participants to make his points for him. The book is painstakingly documented to provide first-person accounts from sources such as newspapers and town meetings.\\" Weizer recommended the book for those researching the subject matter, writing, \\"For specialists on free speech issues, the book provides remarkable detail.\\" In a review for The Historian, Timothy C. Shiell of the University of Wisconsin–Stout wrote, \\"In providing the first detailed history of free speech from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the Fourteenth Amendment of the 1860s, Michael Kent Curtis offers a major contribution to the scholarship of both that era and of free speech.\\" Shiell wrote on the views put forth by the author in the book, \\"Curtis does not limit this erudite work to historical narration. He also addresses political and legal movements and ideas that influenced and were influenced by free-speech controversies such as theories of democracy, justifications for broad protections of free speech, and the doctrines of content neutrality and heckler's veto. His treatment of justifications for suppression is especially valuable.\\" Shiell concluded his review writing, \\"For at least these three reasons—the historical detail, the review of relevant legal and political theory, and the lessons from history—this book is a 'must read' for anyone interested in the period from 1798 to 1870 or in the development of free-speech theory and practice in the United States.\\" Gordon Moran reviewed the book for the Journal of Information Ethics, writing, \\"In this book, Prof. Curtis ... provides a thorough account of the evolution of free speech, in theory and practice, from pre- Revolutionary times through the Civil War and the Fourteenth Amendment (1868). As a history book, it is worthy of being in the library of every high school, college, and university that teaches American history, and would also be very useful and instructive as a textbook for university courses in American studies and advanced courses in American history.\\" In a review for The Journal of Southern History, William Pannill wrote, \\"This is more a work of history than of law. Although the author summarizes the reasoning of legislatures and courts that overrode the First Amendment, he does not analyze the unfolding of constitutional doctrines.\\" Pannill concluded, \\"At 437 pages of text, the book is too long. The writing suffers from repetition. For example, the author reminds us again and again that the southern states feared that debates over slavery would lead to slave revolts-one time was sufficient to make the point. The chapters also jump around in time and subject. Pruning and redrafting would have improved the book for a wider audience. The story certainly deserves one.\\" In his book Freedom of Speech: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution, author Keith Werhan placed Free Speech, \\"The People's Darling Privilege\\" among \\"leading works on free speech\\" during the American Civil War. Werhan noted that the book includes \\"excellent discussions\\" of the Alien and Sedition Acts. In addition to Werhan, Steven J. Heyman's book Free Speech and Human Dignity also recommended Free Speech, \\"The People's Darling Privilege\\" for \\"leading works\\" on freedom of speech. Author Margaret Kohn recommended Free Speech, \\"The People's Darling Privilege\\" as a resource, \\"for extensive examples of the courts' willingness to countenance restrictions on speech\\", in her book Brave New Neighborhoods: The Privatization of Public Space. In Free Expression and Democracy in America: A History, Stephen M. Feldman classed the book among \\"helpful sources on the history of free speech\\". Writing in Lincoln's Censor: Milo Hascall and Freedom of the Press in Civil War Indiana, David W. Bulla wrote, \\"Curtis showed how freedom of the press has both functional and formal protections\\". Judge Andrew P. Napolitano recommended Curtis' book in his books The Constitution in Exile, and Constitutional Chaos, writing, \\"Michael Kent Curtis offers an excellent and detailed account of the troubled affair between Clement Vallandigham and Abraham Lincoln in this work.\\" In Constitutional Democracy: Creating and Maintaining a Just Political Order, Walter F. Murphy wrote that Curtis \\"beautifully detailed\\" an incident when the U.S. Post Office refused to deliver abolitionist writings through their service. In his book Eloquence and Reason: Creating a First Amendment Culture, Robert L. Tsai recommended Curtis' book, \\"for an account of antebellum debates over the scope of the First Amendment\\". In her book Licentious Gotham: Erotic Publishing and Its Prosecution in Nineteenth-Century New York, Donna Dennis recommended Free Speech, \\"The People's Darling Privilege\\", \\"for evidence of commitment to freedom of speech and freedom of press among abolitionists\\".

He estimates that more than 9,000 of his images have been published since the early 1970s, including just about every prominent news, business and entertainment face over that span of history. During the many years he spent under the management of newspaper icon G. Stanleigh Arnold, the Chronicles Sunday and Features Editor, he refined his skills within a team that included Garry Trudeau (Doonesbury), Gary Larson (The Far Side), Abigail Van Buren (Dear Abby), William Hamilton (of The New Yorker), Phil Frank (Farley), and Cathy Guisewite (Cathy). Arnold had also been instrumental in the early stages of Charles Schulz' (Peanuts) career. Waghorn, who resides in West Vancouver, B.C., is currently represented by Universal Press Syndicate of Kansas City, MO, and he continues to create about three new caricatures a week. Universal, a subsidiary of Jim Andrews and John McMeel's Andrews McMeel Universal, founded in 1970, purchased Chronicle Features in 1997.  Biography and background  Kerry was born and raised in North Vancouver, British Columbia, the son of Raymond and Morah Waghorn. His father, also born in British Columbia, was a coppersmith in the vibrant shipbuilding industry of North Vancouver. His mother, born in Louisbourg, N.S. on Canada's east coast, moved at a young age with her family to British Columbia. Kerry has one younger brother, Dean. Kerry graduated from North Vancouver High School in 1965 and soon after attended the recently opened Simon Fraser University in nearby Burnaby, intending to study political science. He immediately became involved with the student newspaper The Peak as an editorial artist and layout editor. When SFU became a Canadian focal point of student and teacher protests, including the occupation of the administration buildings, Kerry's news career became so dominant he lost all interest in academic pursuits. The leap from the student press to underground newspapers and, subsequently, mainstream media became a logical progression. During the student days his preoccupations included playing the drums in a succession of rock bands and also working on fishing boats along the B.C. coast. Yet everything he did came back to art: sketches of fishing boats, captains and crew; and drawings of rock musicians in multiple poses and situations. It was the latter work that attracted the attention of the rock promoters of the late 1960s. Kerry's first commission was a poster advertising an upcoming concert by vocalist Laura Nyro. He was invited into a partnership with poster artist Bob Masse and moved into Masse's studio in Vancouver's Gastown. Posters for concerts of Led Zeppelin, Elton John, the Beach Boys, Boz Scaggs, Chicago, Grand Funk, Canned Heat, Doobie Brothers. Taj Mahal and many others followed. During this era, The Georgia Straight, a trend-setting and controversial flagship of the underground press (still going strong in 2010), began publishing his cartoons. The Straight syndicated his work to a number of alternative newspapers, including the Los Angeles Free Press, the Detroit Free Press and The Berkeley Barb. Mainstream media would soon follow.  Newspapers and syndication  From these first public roots at SFU's Peak, the rock posters and The Straight, he eventually graduated to the city's largest daily, The Vancouver Sun, as a regular contributor. One day he walked uninvited into the offices of The Sun and asked to see the newspaper's nationally recognized editorial cartoonist, Roy Peterson. Peterson was a welcoming host, critically reviewing Kerry's portfolio. His work for The Sun would rapidly elevate his craft into the mainstream, learning as fast as he could from two masters, Peterson, and the equally famous local icon, Len Norris. Peterson was an accomplished news and political cartoonist, but Norris had a different gift. Len Norris was the pulse of a nation, beloved by all. His characters were every man, and every woman, frequently sitting in their kitchen and living room making poignant and sometimes hilarious comments about the world around them. Visiting San Francisco in 1971 with his partner in the production of rock music posters, Kerry decided to pop into The Chronicle unannounced, hoping to show his art portfolio to cartoonist Robert Graysmith, who later achieved fame as the author of the book and subsequent motion picture about the Zodiac murders. The receptionist advised that Mr. Graysmith was not in but, after Kerry explained who he was and what he did, she asked if he would like to meet the Sunday Features Editor? Somewhat overwhelmed by his good fortune, Kerry was escorted in to meet Stan Arnold. This was the chance meeting that would change Kerry's life. Arnold, who died in 1997, would become Kerry's mentor, manager, car pool partner, best friend and fishing buddy. Shortly after that fortuitous first meeting, Kerry began a life of two cities, migrating back and forth between Vancouver and San Francisco, and contributing to both daily newspapers, among other clients. But San Francisco was indisputably big time and Chronicle Features, under Arnold and Stuart Dodds (principal marketing executive when Kerry began and Arnold's successor as editor) had become one of the most formidable syndication services in the newspaper world. Eventually, Kerry Waghorn moved to San Francisco, where he lived for 10 of the happiest years of his life. Gradually, something else began to evolve within his work. Out of his art and cartoon creations, a unique gift began to dominate, and that was his talent for caricature, seeming to be able to drag the depths of a subject's soul and personality, into the visible plane. Chronicle Features launched Faces in the News by Kerry Waghorn in 1977. \\"I felt truly gifted during that era - with Stan Arnold's guidance and Stuart Dodds' incredible salesmanship, my work started appearing all over the world,\\" Kerry remembers. He pays tribute to David Levine of The New York Review of Books as a personal inspiration. Following Levine's death at the end of 2009, Kerry Waghorn issued this statement: \\"In caricature to me he was simply the greatest and still, to this day, it brings me a great deal of pleasure to look at his work.\\" A Universal subsidiary website (www.ucomics.com) characterized Kerry's work as follows: \\"The image is worth a thousand words, and no one can put it like Kerry Waghorn. His caricatures are topical, highly detailed and skilfully drawn. The personality of his subject is always reflected in his illustration. He not only captures features, he captures character. From political figures to sports figures to corporate bigwigs, no face is safe from the scrutiny of Waghorn's pen. He uses his illustrations to satirize his subjects.\\"  Waghorn today  Today, Kerry enjoys the most extensive caricature service in the world. Waghorn's caricatures appear as a daily feature in many countries. His drawings have been published in more than 700 major newspapers and magazines world-wide, representing about 60 nations. Among the journals that have published his creations are the Miami Herald, Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, The New York Times, New York Daily News, Atlanta Journal, Montreal Gazette, Japan Times, Sydney Morning Herald, Hamilton Bermuda Business, Korea Times and New Zealand Herald. Included among the more familiar personalities who have acquired their original caricature by Waghorn are Tom Selleck, Chevy Chase, Michael Ovitz, Bryan Adams, Billy Joel, Bruce Willis, David Bowie, Michael Eisner, Malcolm Forbes, Greg Norman, Chris Evert, Michael Jackson and numerous U.S. and world political leaders. One of his sideline projects during 2005 and 2006 was illustrating a book, a comprehensive expose of Canada's health management, titled Squandering Billions. This required frequent meetings with journalist/author Gary Bannerman and co-author Dr. Don Nixdorf, a noted Canadian health professional. Kerry's parents and a brother, who all are in good health, live in North Vancouver, B.C., where his studio is located. He remained a bachelor until 2009. A few years ago - following an encounter arranged by a mutual friend - Kerry rekindled a relationship with Amber Campbell, an interior designer, who had been his prime romantic interest during school years. Amber and Kerry were married in April 2009 and now reside on the waterfront in West Vancouver, overlooking English Bay. Kerry has little time for hobbies, but enjoys dominoes and fishing for the big Pacific Coast salmon. Among his most memorable adventures since returning from San Francisco have been long boat trips up the coast as far as Alaska with his friend, songwriter and recording star Terry Jacks (\\"Seasons in the Sun\\", The Poppy Family et al.), an environmentalist and passionate outdoorsman.

While most restaurants in the vast majority of the world do not require a reservation, and some do not have a policy or simply any channel for making one, so-called higher-end restaurants mainly in overcrowded cities often require a reservation, and some may have tables booked for weeks in advance. At particularly exclusive venues, it may be impossible to make a reservation on the same day as the planned visit. The modern reservation system evolved from the prior practice of arranging catering at a restaurant. Today, at such venues, observes Joy Smith, author of Kitchen Afloat: Galley Management and Meal Preparation (2002): \\"It's always smart to inquire about a restaurant's reservation policy. Some will only reserve for large parties of six or more\\". In recent times, many restaurants have replaced the traditional pencil and notebook with an online reservation system. Some websites exist which provide this service for multiple venues, such as Tock, Bookatable, Chope, EZTABLE, Dimmi, Killer Rezzy (which also offers “rogue” reservations, which members can sell), OpenTable, Resy, Yelp Reservations (formerly known as SeatMe), Shout (which allows users to either make a reservation or put the one they have up for sale), Zomato, ResDiary, Zurvu and Tablein. Reservations for later dining times may prove problematic, as a restaurant may have a backlog which will require the reservation-holders to wait beyond their stated arrival time. In addition, diners with a late reservation face a higher chance that the restaurant will run out of necessary ingredients for a particularly popular dish. Most restaurants do not charge a customer who fails to honor their reservations, and courts have tended not to impose substantial penalties on restaurants that fail to honor reservations. Nonetheless, it is generally considered polite to call and cancel a reservation once it is known one will not use it.  Benefits  Nowadays it has become common for fine dining restaurants to offer table reservations to their clients. In fact, this service has become an integral part of a restaurant's operation, because of its multiple benefits. Even though there are still types of restaurants that prefer the modality of first-come, first served, the majority of fine dining and casual restaurants organize their operation through table reservations. As it has become part of restaurants’ service to offer reservations, clients are tending more and more towards making use of this offer, and for some people, it has become mandatory to make a table reservation before going out to a restaurant since there are also benefits for the client in this type of service. = Benefits to restaurants = A restaurant will weigh the advantages and the disadvantages of offering the service of table reservations to its customers, and even though there is a cost involved in this service, the benefits it offers will outweigh all the disadvantages one may consider. Offering table reservations may be a good tool to increase demand for certain restaurants. As clients know that there is a limited capacity of seats, they will always prefer to make a table reservation instead of arriving at the restaurant and facing a long waiting line. This tool helps the restaurant to keep a high demand of its customers on busy nights, and even better, to increase traffic on slow nights, when customers make reservations because they don't know how crowded the restaurant will be. Table reservations are also a handy tool in competitive markets since it makes it possible for restaurants to “steal” some market share from its competition. This occurs when clients are not able to get a reservation at their “first choice” restaurant and they decide to go to their “second choice” restaurant, where they are able to get a reservation. This service represents an important benefit for restaurants, because by guaranteeing customers a seat, they will be able to start operating at an earlier time, and serve food until a later time than average, and thus, serve more parties each day, and consequently, have a higher daily income. The modality of table reservations helps restaurants to estimate demand in a more accurate way, and therefore, to improve sourcing and staffing, and to manage costs more efficiently. By managing workflow in a better way, through reservations, the restaurant will be able to deliver a better quality of service. = Benefits to clients = A client will always benefit from being able to make a table reservation at the restaurant to which he wishes to go. Nowadays, the majority of people prefer to go out knowing that they have a reservation, instead of incurring the risk of not getting a table at the desired place. A clear benefit of making a table reservation for a client is the security that they will experience when going out to a restaurant.; i.e., making a reservation will guarantee the client that he will receive his table at the time and place he has planned. It is an advantage for the customer to know in advance that he will not have to go through the trouble of waiting until a table is available, or being put on a waiting list, or in the worst case, needing to find another place to eat, because the one chosen won't be able to serve him. Another important benefit of making a reservation in the desired restaurant is the better quality of service one will receive. As the restaurant knows at what time and with how many people the customer will arrive, a comfortable table with enough seats and space will be reserved, and the restaurant's staff will be prepared to serve the arriving group. = Benefits of an online reservation system = Traditionally, restaurants have managed their reservation systems with a reservation book, which means they received the reservations via telephone calls and wrote them down in a book. Nowadays, as a consequence of the massive use of the Internet and its benefits, experts have seen the opportunity and great added value of creating online reservation systems, and already many restaurants have replaced the traditional format with these new systems. An important advantage of online reservation systems is the flexibility they offer when making a reservation. When reservations are managed in the traditional way, patrons will only be able to call a restaurant to make a reservation during operational hours. On the contrary, when reservations are managed through an online reservation system, customers will be able to make their reservation at any time and from any place they choose. In general, patrons will have a better experience when making an online reservation, because it will be a quick process, the service will be available 24/7, and the system will provide all the necessary information in order to make the desired reservation with tranquility.. Restaurants will experience a great number of benefits when using an online reservation system. Some of these benefits translate into a decline in incoming phone calls, a better control of the capacity of the restaurant and the number of reservations one will be able to accept, and a number of handy statistics and reports that will help to analyze the business in interesting ways. These benefits arise from a wide range of management tools provided by online reservation systems, like operational reports, floor management software, customer reservation histories, and customer databases that include customer data and preferences, and grow with each new table booking. Restaurants will also be able to track cancellations, and manage walk-in and waitlists in a better way, eliminate overbookings, and create target email and postal mailings with the information from the customer database. Some online reservation systems include integrated email marketing tools. Disadvantages Reservations can cause logistical issues for venues. For example, paper-and-pencil reservations can lead to overbooking if performed incorrectly. Although point-of-sale (POS) systems and online systems provide solutions to this issue, overbooking can still occur for reasons such as miscommunication between multiple staff members. Additionally, if a venue is constantly fully booked, it may deter new customers from trying to book a reservation in the future. Guests who create reservations but neither cancel nor show up pose a significant financial risk to restaurants, leading to overstaffing and loss of business from potential paying customers.

The film is one of the few that were produced during the Cultural Revolution.Zhang, Yingjin & Xiao, Zhiwei. \\"Breaking with Old Ideas\\" in Encyclopedia of Chinese Film. Taylor & Francis (1998), p. 101. . As a result of the political upheaval taking place, Breaking with Old Ideas's plot was heavily regulated under highly codified guidelines on story and characterization so that it would have a mass character, as opposed to an individual focused character, namely proletarian politics as opposed to bourgeois politics. The film draws inspiration from issues with schooling in China at the time, such as that there was too much study, and too little social practice.https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected- works/volume-9/mswv9_14.htm#b20 Plot In 1958, the Communist Party of China sends Long Guozheng (Guo Zhenqing), a graduate of the Counter-Japanese Military and Political University, to head the newly established Jiangxi Communist Labour University (today's Jiangxi Agricultural University). The school's more capitalist elements, such as aiming for high bourgeois academic standards, and refusal to admit poorly-educated (according to bourgeois standards) peasants clash with Long's more communistic approach. He advocates only admitting students from the working class, and begins innovative changes—to the dismay of many other staff—such as putting more emphasis on hard labor than classroom learning, switching courses to accommodate experiential learning, removing impractical sections from the curriculum, holding lessons in the field, and excusing students who miss exams to work for the commune. Later, a student Li Jinfeng (Wang Suya), whom Long considers an exemplary follower of the \\"educational revolution\\", faces expulsion and is put on trial. The masses come out in support of her and denounce those taking the capitalist line on education. Those in power taking the capitalist line decide to shut down the college as a result. In the end, the College is saved by the will of the peasants and a pronouncement from Chairman Mao himself.

The company is best known for Line2 apps, which provides Wi-Fi support for mobile phones and multiple devices in lieu of using the service provider.  Line2  Line2 is a Virtual PBX phone service that allows companies to develop and maintain multiple internal phone lines to handle large numbers of external calls. Line2 uses cloud computing to allow one phone call to go to shared receivers, such as cell phones or fax machines, depending on which is more appropriate. Line2 allows for such transfers without any special equipment, performing the same function as many other standard office phone systems. Line2 is priced on a monthly or yearly basis, as well as a limited functionality Free version. Line2 works by providing a single number, used by the employer, which can then be used by the employees, avoiding higher rates by allowing them to use one number as opposed to many of them. This also allows employees to receive calls even when not in the workplace.  Line2 Features  The Line2 (Formerly Toktumi Unlimited) service provides options that allow it to perform some functions similar to phone systems found in large businesses: * Toll Free Number: Line2 offers the ability to choose a toll free number instead of a local number. They were the first company to offer toll free number texting. Customers are able to send and receive texts to and from their toll free number. * Call Handling: Line2 performs this function in many ways, including an \\"auto attendant\\" as well as a standard voicemail program. The auto attendant allows the user to record a custom message before their call is rerouted to the appropriate destination. However, this feature does not allow nested menus. The options presented in the first menu are only programmed to lead to other destinations, not to separate menus with separate options. Additionally, the user can choose for a computerized message to play. The caller identifies his or herself, after which the receiver can take the call or direct it to a voicemail system. Finally, users can choose to record their calls if they desire, after which they can send it to a destination of their choosing. * Address Book: Users have two ways in which to manage contacts within the Line2 Pro service. One can manually input a list of contacts into the Line2 Pro. Additionally, they can submit Outlook databases of their contact lists to the same site. Afterwards, the user divides contacts into personal and business categories. When adding a new contact is necessary, the user either updates the information manually or resubmit an updated contact list to the portal. Line2 Pro also utilizes a type of \\"dial-by-name\\" function wherein users can input a contact's name instead of number. Line2 Pro will then browse the contact list for the number. * Teleconferencing: Line2 Pro also allows users to hold telephone conferences with up to 20 people at once. The interface allows speakers to be put on hold in order to add new participants as needed. Participants are not added simultaneously, and must be added one at a time before they join the conference. Mobile apps Line2 also offers a mobile app for Apple iOS and Android phones called Line2. Line2 is a mobile VoIP app, which means that, although it is on a mobile device, it uses an Internet Protocol address to make calls. This results in cheaper, sometimes stronger service. It provides similar service to applications like Skype, which also allow users to place calls over the Internet for a smaller fee than using a regular phone line. Calls can be made over Wi-Fi, a 3G or 4G phone network, or cellular voice connections. Line2 also gives users two lines; one for business, the other for personal calls. It allows the user to choose between a data network or wi-fi hotspots to transmit calls. A user, for instance, could redirect an incoming call over to their second phone line without interrupting their current call. The app also allows for unlimited texting for all numbers including toll free numbers in Canada and the United States. =Controversy= App store recall The Line2 app was submitted to the Apple App Store on June 5, 2009. It was developed with the goal of providing users with two different phone lines. One would be a personal line, the other used for business. This would allow users to keep any personal numbers private, as well as applying professional business features to the other line. It pended approval until June 23, 2009, when Apple rejected the application. Apple later stated to the company that \\"the application had been rejected because it required people to pay through its website rather than Apple's subscription services that are integrated with the iPhone 3.0 update.\\" Toktumi reported that Salesforce.com allowed sales of apps through the web, but changed the app to work with the App Store. Toktumi resubmitted the app as a demo on July 13, 2009, when Apple told them to wait a few days for testing before it could be released. However, Apple soon pulled all apps related to Google Voice, giving the reason that Voice duplicated features offered by the iPhone. Line2 was included in this recall because its two-line setup was similar to Google Voice. It also included several features shared by the iPhone. On September 2, 2009, Apple approved of the Line2 app, which was quickly added to the App Store almost three months after it was originally submitted. Hacking attempt On March 24, 2010, David Pogue reviewed the Line2 app for the New York Times \\"State of the Art\\" column. Later on in the day, the app was removed from the App Store. After receiving complaints that the article alerted AT&T; to the app, causing them to pull it, CEO Peter Sisson later revealed that Toktumi had suffered a DDoS attack. He pulled the app in order to prevent new customers from having a bad experience as well as taking down the free trial to prevent further problems. A week after the situation, the app was back up for $0.99 on the app store with the free trial reinstated.

He belonged to the Phagmodrupa dynasty which reigned in Tibet or parts of it from 1354 to the early 17th century. He is sometimes represented as the penultimate ruler of the line, although the circumstances about his political position are ill-recorded. Position in the Phagmodrupa dynasty Kagyud Nampar Gyalwa was a son of the preceding ruler of the dynasty, Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen. According to some lists he took over the throne after his father who is known to have died in 1603 or 1604.Sarat Chandra Das, 'Contributions on the religion, history &c;, of Tibet', Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal 1881, p. 242. Building on an indigenous history, Sarat Chandra Das says of him: \\"From the time of Namber-Gyal-van's reign, the chiefs and nobles of U' and Tsaṅ constantly waged war with each other, in consequence of which the power of the king waned, to a great extent. At this time the king of Tsaṅ became very powerful and by taking advantage of the reigning king's weakness gradually became the de facto sovereign of Tibet\\".Sarat Chandra Das, 1881, p. 245. His person is however the most obscure of all in the history of the Phagmodrupa, and there is very little information about his actions in the chronicles. By this time the dynasty had almost ceased to wield any executive power in Tibet. Chinese sources are at variance with the Tibetan ones, since they say that a ruler called Zhashi Cangbu (Tashi Zangpo) flourished after 1579. This ruler is stated to have died around 1600 and been succeeded by his unnamed son.Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan Painted Scrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. II, p. 693. One option is that the son was Kagyud Nampar Gyalwa, but the indigenous Tibetan sources suggest that another scion called Mipham Wanggyur Gyalpo ascended the throne in Nêdong, southeast of Lhasa, in 1604.Olaf Czaja, Medieval rule in Tibet, Vol. I-II. Wien 2013, p. 304. It appears that Kagyud Nampar Gyalwa had to be content with governing as zhabdrung (lama-official) in Gongkar, another stronghold of the Phagmodrupa further to the west.Olaf Czaja, 2013, 314. According to the chronicles of the Fifth Dalai Lama, Kagyud Nampar Gyalwa \\"opened wide the doors of both religious and secular knowledge but paid special attention to the doctrines of Absolute Truth, such as Mahamudra\\".Ngag-dBang Blo-bZang rGya-TSHo, A History of Tibet. Bloomington 1995, p. 159. Yearning for the Dalai Lama During his time the Third Dalai Lama, a friend of the Phagmodrupa, strengthened his ties with the Tümed Mongols. After his death in 1588 a Mongol prince was identified as the new Dalai Lama. The boy, Yonten Gyatso, stayed in Mongolia for several years, although many Tibetans appealed to his family to let him travel to Tibet. Kagyud Nampar Gyalwa wrote a poem in 33 verses where he appealed to the young boy: :\\"Please become a monk and come here, :To this temple where apparitions are displayed, :To Ü Tsang, the purified land that has been cleansed hundreds of times, :By the river current of words of Indian and Tibetan scholars. :Take the place of your previous incarnation :On the fearless Snow Lion Throne, :And ceaselessly turn the wheel of dharma through a hundred eons.\\"Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, One Hundred Thousand Moons. Leiden 2009, p. 307. Actually the fourth Dalai Lama only came to Tibet in 1601. Arriving at Kökö-hota, Yonten Gyatso was met by representatives of the main Gelugpa monasteries and supporting noble families who officially ratified his identity as a true incarnation.Gray Tuttle & Kurtis R. Schaeffer (eds), The Tibetan history reader. New York 2013, p. 285. These included an envoy from Kagyud Nampar Gyalwa's kinsman Mipham Wanggyur Gyalpo who took over the largely illusory throne a few years later, in 1604, and kept it until his death in 1613. It is unclear if Kagyud Nampar Gyalwa ever ruled in Nêdong in his own name. His death is recorded in 1623.Olaf Czaja, 2013, p. 314. At any rate his son Mipham Sonam Wangchuk Drakpa Namgyal Palzang was the last Phagmodrupa ruler before the creation of the dharma state of the Dalai Lamas in 1642.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. I, p. 51, Vol. II, p. 643; Olaf Czaja, 2013, p. 562.

Early life Lauro Aguirre was originally from Batosegachi, Chihuahua. He trained as a civil engineer and spent his early career as a surveyor in Veracruz and Sonora. He married in 1891. Journalism By 1892 he had moved to El Paso, Texas where he published a newspaper entitled El Independiente (The Independent). This drew the attention of United States federal authorities who endeavored to maintain U.S. neutrality in Mexican affairs by monitoring the activities of Mexican rebels who resided north of the international border. In 1895, Aguirre participated in protests against the government of Porfirio Díaz. On 5 February 1896 Aguirre published a call for rebellion against the government of Mexico. The next month the United States government arrested Aguirre and another journalist, Flores Chapa, because the Mexican consul accused them of conspiring to reenter Mexico and engage in revolutionary actions. Aguirre and Chapa were acquitted in U.S. federal court after the U.S. consul's investigation concluded that they had only engaged in legitimate newspaper publishing. In July 1896 a conflict arose along the US-Mexican border known as the Yaqui Uprising, which was associated with a popular leader named Teresa Urrea. Mexican government documents from the period connect Lauro Aguirre to Urrea and other revolutionaries. Aguirre worked with Urrea to organize raids against Mexican customs offices. Revolutionary activities In 1902 Aguirre wrote to President Theodore Roosevelt to request protection as a political refugee, after having heard a rumor that the Díaz government planned to kidnap him. The previous year, the mayor of Ciudad Juárez had complained to United States authorities about subversive activities by Aguirre associated with his newspaper, which had been renamed El Progresista. The U.S. consul charged with investigating Aguirre's complaint found no evidence of a kidnapping plot. Afterward Aguirre launched another newspaper, La Reforma Social, and joined the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM), which was the most extreme of the anti-Díaz organizations. Aguirre became president of the El Paso PLM branch and organized an attempted takeover of Ciudad Juárez. Their plans failed because Díaz government agents infiltrated the PLM. Enrique C. Creel, the governor of Chihuahua, attempted to get Aguirre extradited in 1906 by framing him for murder and having Mexican officials present forged evidence to American officials. Aguirre was arrested and jailed in the United States for forty days before evidence of his innocence prompted his release. Aguirre continued to publish about Mexican politics with another newspaper, El Precursor. He retired in 1913.

The population was 3,129 in the 2010 census, an increase from 2,922 in 2000. History Garner was named after Col. W. W. Garner, a civil engineer on the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad. In 1870, Garner was platted by the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway and was incorporated in 1881 with a population of 321 at that time. In the 1880s, the Duesenberg brothers, who later went on to build the Duesenberg automobile, operated a bicycle sales and repair business in Garner. In the early days of Hancock County the court house was located approximately one mile south of Garner in what was known as Concord. The Concord Court House was platted on April 9, 1859, on a lot known as \\"the Court Square in a village known as Amsterdam but apparently never built. Later, on November 4, 1865, a site for the county seat was proposed. Soon after, John Maben, under the auspices of the Board of Supervisors built two small wooden buildings in an area they called \\"Hancock Center.\\" That building was replaced by a brick building in 1869. That court house continued as the county seat until 1899 when a new court house was built in Garner. In 1898 the town of Britt located a few miles to the west launched a campaign to relocate the County Seat to their town; a plan that was never instituted after some legal intervention by a group of attorneys. Subsequently building of the \\"Klondike\\" railroad that ran through Garner resulted in the building of a new courthouse with the laying of the cornerstone on June 8, 1899, That regal building continues to serve the people of Hancock County to this day.Story of the Hancock County Court House; 1858-1944.

It sits on a bluff above the Saddle River (Passaic River) and is approached from Dunkerhook Road via Barrister Court, a condominium development it is now part of. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 9, 1983. Jacob Vanderbeck Sr., who also built the neighboring Naugle House, built the original section of the house in 1754; it was a small, wooden-framed home on to which a larger wing, to the west, featuring coursed ashlar sandstone walls and one and a half stories under a gambrel roof, was added in the 1780s. Shortly after the National Park Service Heritage Documentation Programs Historic American Buildings Survey took photographs and made architectural drawings of the house in 1938, the house's owners, the Walter Squires, replaced the original east wing of the house with an architecturally compatible addition with sandstone blocks and a gambrel roof that updated the house and significantly increased the home's size. The interior of the house retains many of its original features. The house, undergoing renovation and enlargement in 2019 After the death of its most recent owner, Henrietta Vander Platt, developers showed interest in demolishing the house, removing all of the trees, and placing on the lot an assisted living facility. A group of devoted preservationists and citizens engaged in an effort to save the Vanderbeck House, bolstered by its listing as one of 2013's \\"Ten Most Endangered\\" historic properties by the Trenton-based historic preservation organization Preservation New Jersey.

Usually, when a season ends, I have to deal with a week or two weeks' worth of letdown. Right now, all I'm feeling is relief.\\" On the other hand, Amanda Sloane Murray from IGN gave the season a lukewarm review saying \\"So maybe this season didn't have the funniest jokes or the freshest material to work with. On the whole, it's not one that's going to stand out in our minds as one of the best seasons in the How I Met Your Mother canon; most of us are eager to forget Robin and Barney ever happened, Robin's co-anchor Don was switched up from funny guy to boring straight man and eventually discarded; nobody made significant strides in their career or their love life. Yet at the end of the day, a few loose ends suggest tantalizing possibilities for next season: Ted is now in possession of a house, while Marshall and Lily have decided to get pregnant. Our group is back together, unfettered by relationships inside or outside the inner circle, and we're happy to have it that way.\\" References Category:2009 American television seasons Category:2010 American television seasons 5 ","title":"How I Met Your Mother (season 5)"},{"id":"26702554","text":"Hopper Gristmill Site is located near 156 Ramapo Valley Road in Mahwah, Bergen County, New Jersey, United States.

Steger (July 12, 1902 - July 20, 1968) was an American football player, coach and official. He played for the University of Michigan from 1922 to 1924. Steger later served as an assistant football coach at Northwestern University from 1925 to 1931 and a Big Ten Conference football official from 1931 to 1953. Biography =Oak Park= A native of Oak Park, Illinois, Steger was the halfback for the Oak Park High School football team coached by Glenn Thistlethwaite, who later became the head football coach at Northwestern. During the time that Steger played for Thistlethwaite, the Oak Park football team went through four consecutive seasons without a loss. =Michigan= In 1921, Steger enrolled at the University of Michigan where he played halfback from 1922 to 1924, helping the Wolverines to back-to-back undefeated football seasons in 1922 and 1923. He was considered a \\"triple threat\\" player who had \\"about equal ability in kicking, forward passing and carrying the ball.\\" In Steger's sophomore year of 1922, the Wolverines were 6-0-1 and outscored opponents by a combined tally of 183 to 13. In Steger's first game for Michigan, he ran 60 yards for a touchdown on his first carry. Steger developed appendicitis late in the 1922 season and underwent surgery in Chicago in December 1922. As a junior in 1923, Steger helped lead the Wolverines to an 8-0 record and outscored opponents 150 to 12. Michigan's first conference game in 1923 was against Ohio State in Ann Arbor. Fifty- thousand spectators watched Michigan shut out the Buckeyes 23-0\\\\. Michigan's first touchdown was scored on a 16-yard pass from Irwin Uteritz to Steger in the third quarter. Some suggested during the 1923 season that Steger \\"has even outshone, the great Kipke.\\" An NEA news service profile in late October 1923 praised Steger's diverse talents: > \\"Steger, today, ranks as one of the best gridders Yost has had in seasons. > Captain Harry Kipke not excepted. Fleet of foot, a good forward passer, > splendid punter, and an expert field goal kicker, the former Oak Park lad is > a triple threat artist de luxe. There is no getting away from that. He also > is as good a bet as the Wolverines boast on the receiving end of a pass, > having the uncanny ability to grab 'em out of the air on almost impossible > chances.\\" At the end of the 1923 football season, Steger was elected as captain of the 1924 Michigan Wolverines football team. Through the first half of October 1924, the Wolverines remained undefeated, and Steger had never played a game for a losing football team. In four years at Oak Park and two full seasons at Michigan (1922 and 1923), Steger's teams had not lost a single game. In the buildup to the 1924 game between Michigan and Red Grange's Illinois team, the press played up Steger's winning streak. The following excerpt typifies the coverage: > \\"In Captain Herbert Steger Michigan has something more than a dog-gone good > halfback. It has a symbol of good fortune and victory. Steger is Michigan's > rabbit's foot. In all the time he has been playing football he has yet to > taste the unpalatable dregs of defeat. ... Steger was one of the best backs > in the conferehce last year. But you can tell the wide world that Michigan > is pinning part of its hopes for the Big Ten championship this season on the > luck of its captain. He hasn't failed yet. When he meets Illinois and > matches the old rabbit's foot against Red Grange's threats he will be > subjecting his charmed football life to its severest strain.\\" His streak came to an end in the Illinois game on October 19, 1924. The game was the dedication game for the new Memorial Stadium in Urbana, Illinois. Grange took Steger's opening kickoff and ran it back 95 yards for a touchdown. Grange scored five touchdowns in the game and ran for 402 yards. After the game, Illini fans and player praised Steger for his sportsmanship and bravery in the game. Illini players reported that Steger had \\"arched his body over Grange while tackling him to prevent an injury to the man who blasted the hopes of Michigan.\\" Steger was the Wolverines' second leading scorer in 1924 with five touchdowns for 30 points. At the end of the 1924 season, Steger was selected as a third-team All-American by All-Sports Magazine, based on the combined vote of 312 prominent football coaches, officials and sport writers from all sections of the country, \\"representing the opinions of the best informed critics in all parts of the country.\\" =Northwestern= In 1925, Steger accepted a position as an assistant coach at Northwestern where his former high school coach George Thistlewaite was the head football coach. After Northwestern tied Michigan for the 1926 Big Ten Conference football championship, the Athletic Board at Northwestern gave Steger a gold football as \\"a tribute to his coaching prowess.\\" He served as a backfield coach for the Wildcats through the 1931 football season. =Later years= From 1931 to 1968, Steger worked as an insurance broker with offices at 175 West Jackson Boulevard in Chicago. He also worked as a Big Ten Conference football official from 1931 to 1953. Steger died in July 1968 at his home on Chicago Avenue in Oak Park, Illinois. He was 66 years old at the time of his death and was survived by his wife, Bernice Steger, and a daughter, Judith Arado.

Sources  Brief accounts of Mari's patriarchate are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth- century), Amr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century).

Longicrusavis was a ground dwelling carvinore, a wader, and part of biological family Hongshanornithidae, considered to have been a dominant species in the Jehol Biota, the prehistoric Chinese ecosystem which supported them. The name Hongshanornithidae represents one of Chinas oldest recorded cultures in the region, the Hongshan culture. Description Longicrusavis is a ground dwelling carnivore known from the holotype specimen PKUP V1069, found from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation in Liaoning Province, China., which consists of shale slab and counter slab. The skeleton is nearly complete and belongs to an adult individual, with carbonized feathers preserved in full plumage with visible colouration around the head and forelimbs. Like the closely related genus Hongshanornis, Longicrusavis has hindlimbs that are very long relative to the forelimbs. Longicrusavis has a rostrum that is more robust than that of Hongshanornis. The skull, though broken in the individual specimen, would be roughly triangular in shape with large eye socket orbits. In lateral view, the dorsal margin of the skull is slightly concave, but not as much as the dorsal margin of the skull of Hongshanornis, where there is an abrupt constriction at the rostrum. Although no teeth are preserved, they were likely present in the upper jaw owing to the presence of alveoli, or tooth sockets, in the premaxilla and maxilla. Otherwise, Longicrusavis is one of the closest examples to a toothless bird with an evolving beak. Hongshanornis also appears to have alveoli, despite being described as toothless when it was first named. No alveoli are found in the mandible, indicating that it was likely edentulous. Longicrusavis exhibits an obvious long, thin, pointed beak. Comparison of the tail feathers to another similar discovery, both possessing a long fan shaped tail improving flight, suggests these to be the oldest form of bird with this type of tail. Implications Longicrusavis is important because detailed evidence of transitioning dinosaurs to birds are rare. Specimen PKUP V1069 also gives us, in conjunction with another palaeontological discovery five years before, evidence a range of small specialised birds from the early Cretaceous, 120-130 million years ago. The holotype evidencing the discovery is held at the Beijing Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) as part of a collection. Jehol Biota The Longicrusavis fossil was part the Jehol Biota from which is unearthed a whole range of palaeontological finds including dinosaurs, mammals, birds, fishes and invertebrates. \\"The Jehol Biota never fails to stop giving, and the research to be done on these fossils is virtually endless!\\" said O'Connor who has determined at least three evolutionary stages to divide history based on the Dabeigou (130ma), Yixian (125ma), and Jiufotang (120ma) Formation periods issuing the Longicrusavis are the earlier Yixian and Jiufotang.

He belonged to the Phagmodrupa Dynasty which reigned in Tibet, or parts of it, from 1354 to the early 17th century, and was the last prince of the dynasty.Sarat Chandra Das, 'Contributions on the religion history &c;, of Tibet', Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal 1881, p. 242. Support for the Dalai Lama Mipham Sonam Wangchuk Drakpa Namgyal Palzang was the eldest son of the prince Kagyud Nampar Gyalwa (died 1623) and the grandson of king Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen (died 1603/04). The circumstances around his accession are extremely obscure. The materials worked out by Giuseppe Tucci suggests that he succeeded to the throne by c. 1600.Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan Painted Scrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. II, Genealogical table VI. In the early years of the 17th century he is intermittently mentioned in the sources with the ruling title (desi). However, according to the investigation Olaf Czaja, Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen was actually succeeded by a scion of a rival branch, Mipham Wanggyur Gyalpo, in 1604. Only some time after the death of the latter in 1613, Mipham Sonam Wangchuk Drakpa Namgyal Palzang would have been consecrated as ruler.Olaf Czaja, Medieval rule in Tibet, II Vols. Wien 2013, Vol I, pp. 304, 312-20. Whether his father Kagyud Nampar Gyalwa ever ruled in his own name is not clear.The king-list in Sarat Chandra Das, 1881, p. 242, has the succession Nan-Wan Grags-po [Ngawang Drakpa] - Namber-Gyalpo [Nampar Gyalwa] - bSod-nams Wan-phyug [Sonam Wangchuk], and does not mention Mipham Wanggyur Gyalpo.. Whatever the case, by this time the dynasty had since long been eclipsed by other political and religious centers. However, in the early years of the 17th century the authority of the Phagmodrupa revived somewhat in the Ü region (East Central Tibet). This was due to their good connections with the Gelugpa.David Snellgrove & Hugh Richardson, A cultural history of Tibet. Bloomington 1968, p. 193. The main political division at this time was between the Gelugpa sect, aided by their Mongol allies, and the Karmapa and their patrons of the Tsangpa dynasty. The Phagmodrupa kings were traditionally friendly disposed towards the Gelugpa leaders, the Dalai Lamas. Defeated by the Tsangpa The position of the Phagmodrupa was nevertheless fragile. In 1613 their troops carried out a raid in the Lhasa valley. This provoked a swift retaliation by the Tsangpa.Olaf Czaja, 2013, Vol. I, pp. 311-2. From his base in the Tsang region (West Central Tibet), the Tsangpa ruler made repeated incursions into Ü.David Snellgrove & Hugh Richardson, 1968, p. 193. In 1616 he subjugated the Kyishod area close to Lhasa and forced the Phagmodrupa palace in Nêdong to submit. With this stroke, most of Ü and Tsang was in the hands of the Tsangpa lord Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, who was now arguably the King of Tibet.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. I, pp. 55–6. Possibly, the 1616 intervention is a duplicate of the similar Tsangpa invasion in 1618. His triumph was confirmed by a new successful Tsangpa invasion in 1618. Lhasa was taken, and the Gelugpa lost their most important monasteries in Ü and Tsang.Laurent Deshayes, Histoire du Tibet. Paris 1997, p. 142. Karma Phuntsok Namgyal now moved to eliminate the last possible obstacle to hegemony in Ü, namely the Phagmodrupa of Nêdong. In 1620 he led an expedition that surrounded Nêdong and occupied the entire Yarlung Valley. All resistance was crushed and the Tsangpa took over the fortress at Nêdong.Olaf Czaja, 2013, Vol. I, p. 315. Whether Mipham Sonam Wangchuk Drakpa Namgyal Palzang was the ruler at this time is not clear. At any rate he survived under obscure circumstances in the following decades, being forced by the circumstances to side with the Tsangpa. During the Gelugpa-Karmapa struggle in 1635 he was expelled from Lhasa.Günther Schulemann, Geschichte der Dalai-Lamas. Leipzig 1958, p. 230. In the chronicles of the Fifth Dalai Lama (1643), he is still spoken of with a degree of regard.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. II, p. 641. Under the Dalai Lama regime With the final triumph of Dalai Lama over the Tsangpa in 1642, the Phagmodrupa regime was at any rate a thing of the past. The ruler was allowed to keep his estates and met a number of times with the Dalai Lama. However, he suffered mental problems and was not respected by the other regional lords.Olaf Czaja, 2013, Vol. I, p. 335. The first ruler of the Qing dynasty, the Shunzhi Emperor, notified the Fifth Dalai Lama in 1657 that the Phagmodrupa lord had recently sent envoys to the Chinese court: \\"I have been told that the Chanhuawang [Phagmodrupa lord] was originally King of Tibet and then was overthrown by Tsangpa Khan. Tsangpa Khan was overthrown later by Gushri Khan of Oirat. The latter put the Chanhuawang under the Fifth Dalai Lama who again put the prince under the depa [regent] ... Now he [the envoy] has come to ask that the seals and certificate be exchanged without reporting the truth.\\" The Shunzhi Emperor questioned the diplomatic initiative of the Phagmodrupa and asked Dalai Lama to clarify matters. This implies that the imperial court now considered the Phagmodrupa dynasty a concluded chapter.Ya Hanzhang, Biographies of the Tibetan Spiritual leaders Panchen Lamas. Beijing 1994, p. 386. When Mipham Sonam Wangchuk Drakpa Namgyal Palzang died in 1671, no successor to his estate was appointed, and in 1675 Nêdong was given to an outsider. The last known members of the Phagmodrupa line were his son Lozang Khyentse Wangchuk (b. 1625) and grandson Yizhin.Olaf Czaja, 2013, Vol. I, pp. 327-42.

History Mauricio Gonzales, son of Rafael Gonzales grantee of Rancho San Miguelito de Trinidad, was granted the six square league Rancho Cholame from the secularized holdings of Mission San Miguel Arcángel in 1844, but it was soon abandoned due to Indian raids. Charles White (1823–1853), a native of Ireland who came overland from Missouri in 1846 with his wife, Ellen E.

Karl was also the northernmost forming Atlantic hurricane on record in November. The fifteenth and final tropical cyclone, twelfth named storm, and ninth hurricane of the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season, Karl developed at the center of another, larger extratropical cyclone over the North Atlantic. After being classified a subtropical cyclone on November 25, it became more independent of its parent storm and grew into a full-fledged Category 1 hurricane. It peaked in intensity on November 26, and ultimately dissipated on November 29, as it merged with another system. Karl holds the record for the northernmost formation of a November tropical or subtropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean. It also attained hurricane strength at an unusual latitude, and contributed to one of the most active Novembers on record in terms of tropical cyclones. However, it stayed over open waters and did not have any effects on land. It was the 11th named storm of the season. Meteorological history Hurricane Karl originated in a low pressure area that formed along a frontal boundary near the southeastern United States. It approached the Canadian Maritimes the next day and strengthened to below 1000 millibars. On November 24, the broad cyclone was located south of Newfoundland, and early the next day a mass of convection developed near the core. It evolved into a separate vortex, and due to the lack of inhibiting wind shear, a small cyclone developed. It became a subtropical storm at 00:00 UTC before executing a tight counterclockwise loop as it rotated within the larger cyclone. About 18 hours later, the storm strengthened and gained enough tropical characteristics to be designated a hurricane, accompanied by the formation of a pronounced eye feature. At the time, it was situated around 610 miles (1,110 km) west-southwest of the Azores. Although the development of a tropical cyclone within a non-tropical storm is rare, it is not unprecedented. An unnamed hurricane in November 1991, and Subtropical Storm Alpha in September 2020 also formed in this manner. After being classified as a hurricane, Karl gradually strengthened, and its circulation became more distinguished from the surrounding cloudiness. A trough that emerged from North America steered the hurricane eastward, and on November 26, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a central barometric pressure reading of 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg). Karl maintained this strength for approximately 18 hours until beginning to weaken slightly as it accelerated towards the northeast. On November 27, the storm's eye became more ragged as the cyclone passed within 230 miles (370 km) of the Azores and started to show signs of deterioration. The trough over the North Atlantic developed into the dominant low pressure area, and Karl turned northward around its periphery. Karl became extratropical on November 28 and later merged with another approaching system within a day, and was declared dissipated by November 29. Records Satellite view of the hurricane near its peak Hurricane Karl was unusual in several aspects. It developed late in the hurricane season, which runs from June 1 through November 30, over waters colder than the standard limit for tropical cyclone formation. It marked the farthest-north development of a November tropical or subtropical cyclone on record. While the 1991 unnamed hurricane was farther north, it became a subtropical storm late on October 31, and had moved south by November 1. Karl was reported at the time to be the farthest-east hurricane during the last 10 days of the month of November. Additionally, it maintained hurricane intensity until reaching 45.0°N, at which point it became extratropical; only Hurricane Lois in 1966 lasted as a hurricane farther north in the month of November. When Karl became a hurricane on November 25, the 1980 season became notable for having two November hurricanes; the other was Jeanne. This tied 1932 and 1969 for the record of the most November hurricanes, which was later accomplished during the 1994 season. Later, 2001 broke this record with three hurricanes.

Thompson served as the Merrie Monarch's executive director since 1968 with Naope. She remained the festival's head until her death in 2010. Thompson initially had to push hard for funds and media coverage during the festival's early years. Throughout her tenure as director of the festival, Thompson was careful to keep its main focus on hula. She kept admission prices low and resisted efforts to move Merrie Monarch from Hilo's Edith Kanaka'ole Tennis Stadium, where it has traditionally been held, to a larger facility.

Biography Eichner was born to Johann Andreas Eichner (1694–1768), a court musician to the court of Waldeck. His father provided him with his primary musical education. He became widely known as a virtuoso bassoonist throughout Europe as a result. In 1762 he entered into the service of Duke Christian IV of Zweibrücken as a violinist. In 1768, he became the concertmaster of the Zweibrücken court orchestra, where he remained until 1772. He was highly respected by his contemporaries and achieved international recognition as an accomplished composer, bassoonist, and concertmaster during his lifetime. Eichner, however, died young and was quickly forgotten. To musicologists, he is known as a representative of the Mannheim School. His 31 symphonies and 20 concertos comprise the main body of his works, but he also composed chamber music including Six Flute Quartets op. 4. In 1772 his compositions were published almost simultaneously in Paris, London, and Amsterdam. Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart praised Eichner's works in 1784 for their gracious charm and \\"melting sweetness\\". His Harp Concerto in D Major op. 9 (movements: Allegro, Andante, and Tempo di Minoetto) is performed to this day. His daughter was composer Adelheid Maria Eichner.

It provides services in the field of human rights advocacy. Regional offices National Commission forJustice and Peace has seven regional offices in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Multan, Hyderabad, Quetta, Karachi and a head office in Lahore, which provide legal aid and human rights education. Under the legal aid program, the commission provides legal counselling and financial assistance. NCJP has dealt with about 800 cases during their first 22 years. The first advocacy campaign was launched by NCJP against bonded labour in brick kiln factories in 1987. With other organizations joining in, this campaign achieved some success. A law on abolition of bonded labour was passed in 1992. The Commission now concentrates on bonded labour in the agricultural sector. NCJP reacts to discriminatory laws and state policies. In 1988, the Commission filed an appeal in the Supreme Court of Pakistan against the system of Separate Electorates in the country. In 1992 when the government tried to include religion on the National Identity Card, the civil society in Pakistan waged a countrywide campaign under the leadership of NCJP’s Chairperson Bishop John Joseph. The campaign was successful and the government was forced to withdraw the decision.

Blasphemy laws Since 1990, the Commission has defended cases of blasphemy against Muslims, Christians and Hindus, and has campaigned for abolition of the blasphemy laws. Father Emmanuel Y. Mani, National Director since 1995, spoke at a press conference sponsored by AsiaNews titled “Save Christians and Pakistan from the blasphemy laws”. He informed international public opinion about the institutional injustices against religious minorities, in particular against the Christian community in Pakistan. The international community is putting pressure on the Pakistani government to stop discrimination and violence against religious minorities. Blasphemy laws include Article 295, Sections B and C, and Article 298, Sections A, B and C, of the Pakistan Penal Code. These laws were incorporated into the criminal justice system between 1980 and 1986 by then President of Pakistan Zia-ul-Haq, supposedly to ensure respect for the Prophet Mohammed, his Companions and the Quran. These laws are unique in the contemporary world because they allow dubious charges to be brought against people who have been subjected to extra judicial killings, arson and destruction of their property. Fundamentalism In 2009 Peter Jacob, national secretary of NCJP, spoke out against the agreement between the local government and the Taliban, which allowed the introduction of sharia (Islamic) law, in exchange for a ceasefire in the district of Malakand, which includes the Swat valley, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (old name Northwest Frontier Province). The agreement was signed in 2009 by the government of the NWFP and the Taliban Education Several civil society organisations have taken notice of religious hate speeches and school textbook content and urged the government to take the issue seriously. According to a recent report by NCJP, the commission monitored four major national Urdu dailies from August to October 2005 and found extremely provocative news reports, statements and editorials against religious minorities including Christians, Hindus, Ahmadis and Jews. School textbooks should be monitored for hate-content and revised to promote inter-faith harmony. NCJP has demanded that the government make provision for non-Muslim students to receive religious lessons in their own faith in lieu of courses on Islamic belief and practice. Archbishop Lawrence Saldanha of Lahore, the commission's chairman, and Peter Jacob, its executive secretary, expressed their concern in a press release.

He ranks as one of the earliest, if not the earliest, named poets to have composed and performed in Welsh. The better known poets Aneirin and Taliesin, who may have been slightly younger contemporaries, also belong to this early generation, the first of those known to modern scholars as the Cynfeirdd (\\"first poets\\"). Whereas medieval Welsh manuscripts preserve verse composed by or otherwise ascribed to the latter two figures, no such work survives for Talhaearn and in fact, his former fame seems to have largely vanished by the later Middle Ages. Historia Brittonum An interpolated passage in the Historia Brittonum (9th century) describes him as a famous poet, along with Aneirin, Taliesin and two lesser known figures, Blwchfardd and Cian: :Tunc Talhaern Tat Aguen in poemate claruit, et Neirin, et Taliessin, et Bluchbard, et Cian qui vocatur Gue[ni]th Guaut, simul uno tempore in poemate Brittanico claruerunt. :\\"Then Talhaearn Tad Awen (MS. Talhaern Tataguen) was renowned in poetry, and Neirin and Taliessin and Bluchbard and Cian, who is called Gueinth Guaut, together at the same time were renowned in British poetry.\\" The epithet Tataguen or the later form Tad Awen means \\"father of the Muse\\" or \\"father of (poetic) inspiration\\",Lewis, \\"The historical Background of Early Welsh Verse\\", p. 31. and his first name, which has in common with Taliesin the first element tal (\\"brow, forehead\\"), translates as \\"Iron-brow\\".Koch, \\"Five Poets, Memorandum of the\\" The context of the passage seems to link these five poets to the middle of the 6th century, when an otherwise unknown chieftain called Eudeyrn (MS. [O]utigirn) fought against the English, notably Ida, king of Bernicia, and when Maelgwn ruled the kingdom of Gwynedd. Talhaearn's honorific nickname and the place accorded to him in the enumeration of British poets may indicate that he was regarded as the \\"father\\" of early Welsh poetry, possibly preceding the others by a short period. Allusions in Middle Welsh poetry The figure of Talhaearn makes brief side-appearances in several later, Middle Welsh texts. In the Welsh Triads, nos. 33 and 34, his patron appears to be same chieftain who killed Aneirin. The first of these, Triad 33, holds one Heidyn son of Enygan or Heiden son of Efengad, possibly a ruler of the \\"Old North\\",Bromwich, Trioedd Ynys Prydein, p. 74. responsible for a fatal hatchet- blow on Aneirin's head.Trioedd Ynys Prydein, ed. and tr. Bromwich, Triad 33 and 33W.In Triad 33W, Aneirin is called a daughter of Teyrnbeirdd (merch teyrnbeirdd), but to judge by the shorter version of the triad in Peniarth 51, this is evidently a corruption of mechdeyrn beirdd \\"overlord of bards\\". Bromwich, Trioedd Ynys Prydein, p. 72; Ford, \\"Death of Aneirin\\", p. 45. In the version of this triad found in the White Book of Rhydderch, Heiden is identified as \\"the man who used to give a hundred kine every Saturday in a bath-tub to Talhaearn\\".'y gvr a rodei gan muv pob Sadarn yg kervyn eneint yn Talhaearn'. Trioedd Ynys Prydein, ed. and tr. Bromwich, Triad 33W. The precise nature of these rewards remains unclear; can muv may, for instance, be a scribal error for can mu, a unit of value described elsewhere.Bromwich, Trioedd Ynys Prydein, p. 73 In any event, the probability is that Heiden was Talhaearn's patronFord, \\"Death of Aneirin\\", p. 45. and it is possible therefore that the passage alludes a lost story about rivalry between the two great poets.Bromwich, Trioedd Ynys Prydein, p. 509. Listing the \\"Three Unfortunate Hatchet-Blows\\" of Britain, Triad 34 also alludes to the anecdote (though using the variant name Eidyn), but only one late manuscript version of the triad mentions Talhaearn.Trioedd Ynys Prydein, ed. Bromwich, Triad 34 (C 18). Further mention of Talhaearn is made in a difficult Middle Welsh poem entitled Angar Kyfyndawt, which is singly preserved in the Book of Taliesin. Taliesin is staged here as the first- and third-person speaker of the poem, who presents himself as a skilled and inspired poet. In passing, he is made to refer, once to Cian and twice to Talhaearn.Angar Kyfyndawt, ed. J. Gwenogvryn Evans, 19.4 (Cian), 20.4 (ieith Talhayarn), 21.16-7 (Talhayarn yssyd mwyhaf ysywedyd). Talhaearn is praised as the \\"greatest of the wise men\\" (mwyhaf y sywedyd), a reputation which is hinted at some lines earlier.

It is the last of a series of waterfalls along the hanging valley formed where Fall Creek intersects the glacial trough of Cayuga Lake. The falls are in an amphitheater formed by freezing and thawing of the weak shale which makes up most of the gorge walls. The splash pool, and the creek just below the falls, are a popular spot for fly fishing. The area around the base of the falls was owned by Cornell University for many years, before being sold to the City of Ithaca in 2000 as a part of environmental cleanup. The area has been a popular, if dilapidated, park for many years; currently it is undergoing a major redesign and rebuild. In June 2016, the Ithaca Common Council voted to demolish a house directly north of the falls and add the parcel to the park. The city had acquired the house after the owner failed to pay property taxes. The falls is present as the stylized \\"I\\" in the \\"Ithaca is Gorges\\" logo. History In the early 1800s, local entrepreneurs realized the economic potential of the water power provided by Fall Creek. In 1830, a young Ezra Cornell blasted a tunnel through the gorge wall just above Ithaca Falls, and built a small diversion dam to divert water to run a complex of mills next to the falls. \\"The powerful flow of water over the Ithaca Falls made possible the close location of mills one above another on the southern bank of Fall Creek. ... grist, plaster, oil, and woolen mills, and iron foundries were all established there. The mills processed local and imported raw materials, producing enough not only for local needs but for shipment outside the region.\\" The industry around the falls resulted in rapid development in the area; for a time, \\"Fall Creek Village\\" was considered a separate town from the rest of Ithaca. The diversion dam remained until succumbing to natural forces in 2013; around the base of the falls, many ruins from the former mills still exist. From 1880 until its closure in 1987, the Ithaca Gun Company's factory was just south of the falls. In the late 1990s, environmental testing revealed that much of the soil nearby was contaminated by lead from shotgun tests. A major lead clean-up effort sponsored by the United States Superfund and the EPA took place from 2002 to 2004,\\"EPA Finishes $4.8 Million Cleanup at Ithaca Gun\\", United States Environmental Protection Agency, October 29, 2004.

Mari also said that Ishoʿyahb's short reign of four years and six months was marked by 'disputes and disorders painful to relate and unhelpful to explain', implying that the patriarch’s instructions were defied by many of his metropolitans and bishops. Disorder even marked his death. Baghdad at this period was the frequent target of bandit raids and in 1025 its western suburb of Karkh was burned down in a particularly bold raid. Ishoʿyahb IV died in May 1025, and his funeral ceremony had to be held at night for fear that its traditional extravagance might attract unwelcome attention.Mari, 117–18 (Arabic), 103–4 (Latin); Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 201 See also * List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East Notes References * Abbeloos, J.

It is a member of the Synanceiidae (devilfishes, goblinfishes, and stonefishes) family of the Scorpaeniformes order of ray- finned fishes. These benthic fishes are found on sandy or silty substrates of lagoon and seaward reefs, in coastal regions of tropical oceans.Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2010.FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. Fish Identification at FishBase, version (01/2010).Inimicus filamentosus. Accessed 23 March 2010. Like all the other known species of Inimicus, I. filamentosus is a demersal ambush predator. They are nocturnal, and often dig themselves partially into the sandy seabed during the day. Distribution Western Indian Ocean: Red Sea and East Africa to Maldives. Description Adults are typically 13-25 centimeters in length, and can weigh up to 480 grams. The body color can be a dull yellow, gray, brown, or rust in color with light blotches, and very similar to that of the surrounding sandy or coral seabed in which they are found. This coloration acts as a camouflage which renders them extremely difficult to detect in their natural habitat. The skin is without scales except along the lateral line, and is covered with venomous spines and wartlike glands which give it a knobby appearance. The head is flattened, depressed and concave. The eyes, mouth and nostrils project upwards and outwards from the dorsal aspect of the head. Sexual dimorphism is not believed to occur in this species. Fin morphology: * dorsal fin: composed of 15 to 17 spines and 7 to 9 soft rays. * caudal fin: composed of 2-4 spines and 4-14 soft rays, with dark bands at basal and subterminal positions. * pelvic fin: composed of one spine and 3-5 soft rays. * pectoral fin: composed of 10-12 rays. The two most caudal rays of each pectoral fin are detached from the rest of the fin, and angled in a ventral direction. The fish employ these two rays to prop up the forward part of their body, as well as to \\"walk\\" along the bottom of the substrate.World Database of Marine Species: Spiny devil fish . Accessed 03-22-2010.WetWebMedia.com: The Ghoulfish/Scorpion/Stonefishes of the Subfamily Choridactylinae (Inimicinae), by Bob Fenner. Accessed 03-27-2010. The ventral surface of the pectoral fins bears broad black bands containing smaller, lighter spots at the basal and distal ends. In I. filamentosus, these bands are attenuated, while the bands of I. sinensis have yellow spots on them. This is a key feature for distinguishing the two species, which are otherwise nearly identical. Behavior I. filamentosus is a piscivorous ambush predator. It is nocturnal and typically lies partially buried on the sea floor or on a coral head during the day, covering itself with sand and other debris to further camouflage itself. It has no known natural predators. When disturbed by a scuba diver or a potential predator, it fans out its brilliantly colored pectoral and caudal fins as a warning. Once dug in, it is very reluctant to leave its hiding place. When it does move, it displays an unusual mechanism of subcarangiform locomotion — it crawls slowly along the seabed, employing the four lower rays (two on each side) of its pectoral fins as legs.

Though he wrote a few works in larger forms, he is today chiefly remembered for his romances, particularly \\"Oh, Could I But Express in Song\\". Little is recorded of Malashkin's career; born in Moscow, he received his musical training abroad, and in 1870 began teaching voice at the Kiev Theological Seminary. He appears to have been primarily a composer of Russian Orthodox liturgical music, of pieces for piano, and of songs.The Last Weeks of the Concert Season\\" from the Russian Register (1873) Among his larger-format works were several symphonies, including at least two on folk themes and one titled the \\"Triumphant\\"; the latter, along with one of the folk symphonies and a collection of songs, was performed at an all-Malashkin concert at the Hall of the Assembly of the Nobility in Saint Petersburg in 1873. The same program was repeated in Moscow during the same concert season. In both cases, the composer conducted, with tenor Fyodor Nikolsky and mezzo- soprano Aleksandra Krutikova as soloists. Neither of the concerts was successful, with Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (in his capacity as a music critic) writing: > So far Mr Malashkin's attempts at composing are no more than a harmless > passion, but if nothing is done to hinder the development of this passion, > then God alone knows what lamentable consequences lie in store for this > misguided lover of musical composition. The point is that, in spite of Mr > Malashkin's quite amazing lack of talent, he is evidently working hard on > perfecting his imaginary abilities as a composer, for in his dreary and > aimless musical outpourings one can nevertheless see a certain schooling and > theoretical knowledge. Malashkin wrote one opera, on the subject of Ilya Muromets; this was premiered in Kiev in 1879, but was also not held to be a success. He also collected and arranged folk songs, and published a collection of songs from Ukraine in the 1890s. Malashkin is remembered today for a single romance, \\"Oh, Could I But Express in Song\\" - sometimes translated as \\"O, Could I in Song Tell My Sorrow\\" - which was at one time greatly popular; it has been recorded by singers as diverse as Alexander Kipnis, Feodor Chaliapin, and John McCormack. It is at least as famous as the subject of an oft-retold apocryphal tale. The most popular version of the story claims that a customer has telephoned a music store with a request for the sheet music of the song in question. The clerk, having written it down, proceeds to perform a fruitless inventory search for Kodály's \\"Buttocks-Pressing Song\\". Other versions of the story ascribe the misunderstanding to a radio announcer. Another popular romance, oft erroneously labelled as a folk song, was also composed by Malashkin, in 1881: \\"Я встретил Вас\\", \\"I met you\\", with words by Fyodor Tyutchev.История одной любви Among others, Boris Shtokolov and Dmitri Hvorostovsky have both recorded this song. Malashkin died in Moscow in 1902.

Eulerian lattices generalize face lattices of convex polytopes and much recent research has been devoted to extending known results from polyhedral combinatorics, such as various restrictions on f-vectors of convex simplicial polytopes, to this more general setting.  Examples  * The face lattice of a convex polytope, consisting of its faces, together with the smallest element, the empty face, and the largest element, the polytope itself, is an Eulerian lattice. The odd–even condition follows from Euler's formula. * Any simplicial generalized homology sphere is an Eulerian lattice. * Let L be a regular cell complex such that L is a manifold with the same Euler characteristic as the sphere of the same dimension (this condition is vacuous if the dimension is odd). Then the poset of cells of L, ordered by the inclusion of their closures, is Eulerian. * Let W be a Coxeter group with Bruhat order. Then (W,≤) is an Eulerian poset.  Properties  * The defining condition of an Eulerian poset P can be equivalently stated in terms of its Möbius function: :: \\\\mu_P(x,y)=(-1)^{y-x} \\\\text{ for all } x\\\\leq y. * The dual of an Eulerian poset, obtained by reversing the partial order, is Eulerian. * Richard Stanley defined the toric h-vector of a ranked poset, which generalizes the h-vector of a simplicial polytope.Enumerative combinatorics, 3.14, p. 138; formerly called the generalized h-vector.

He was appointed on March 16, 2010 by Governor Mark Parkinson to replace Ron Thornburgh who resigned on February 15, 2010. On Nov. 2nd, 2010, he was defeated for election to a full term by a wide margin. Biggs Served as Kansas Securities Commissioner from 2003 until his appointment as Secretary of State. Prior to that, he served as Geary County Prosecutor from 1989 to 2003 and as a public defender from 1983 to 1988. In 2002, he was the Democratic nominee for Attorney General. Though he lost to Republican Phill Kline by only .5%, he declined to request a recount. Early life Biggs was born on October 14, 1958 in Kansas City, Missouri as the youngest of five children. His family settled in Manhattan, Kansas when Chris was a child. His father, John, ran a local hardware store and served as a state restaurant inspector. His mother, Bernice, was a staff secretary at Kansas State University. He graduated from Manhattan High School in 1976. Education Biggs graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Kansas State University in 1980 with a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work. He attended the University of Kansas School of Law, graduating in 1983. Legal career Upon graduation from law school, Biggs started working as a public defender for the 8th Judicial District in Kansas, based in Junction City. His first case was an argument in front of the Kansas Supreme Court. In 1988, Biggs was elected to serve as the prosecutor for Geary County, and was subsequently re-elected three times. In the 14 years he served as prosecutor, he tried over 20,000 cases; the most notable of these was the trial of Sabine Davidson. Davidson was charged with unintentional second-degree murder in the death of an 11-year-old boy who had been mauled by her three Rottweilers. Biggs’ prosecution of Davidson resulted in a conviction of second-degree murder and a sentence of 12 years in prison—the first conviction of its kind in the nation. The trial earned Biggs the 1998 Kansas Outstanding Prosecutor Award. 2002 election for Attorney General In 2002, incumbent Attorney General of Kansas Carla Stovall chose not to seek re-election. Phill Kline, a former state legislator, emerged from a bruising Republican primary, defeating David Adkins; Biggs ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. Biggs was endorsed by the Mainstream Coalition, the Fraternal Order of Police, the Kansas City Star, the Wichita Eagle, former Attorney General Vern Miller, and the Topeka Capital-Journal. Though Kline led in the polls throughout the race, the final tally was too close to call on election night; in the end, Kline won by 0.5% of the total vote (4,287 vote margin out of 821,107 cast). Kansas Securities Commissioner In May 2003, Governor of Kansas Kathleen Sebelius named Biggs to be the Kansas Securities Commissioner, saying that Biggs \\"was a good fit.\\" As Securities Commissioner, Biggs personally prosecuted Thomas Etheredge, founder of the failed Wild West World theme park north of Wichita, for securities fraud; Etheredge was convicted on seven of nine counts and sentenced to five years in prison. Secretary of State In January 2010, Biggs announced his candidacy for Secretary of State. On February 15, 2010, then-Secretary of State Ron Thornburgh announced his resignation in order to run for governor. After interviewing 15 candidates, Governor Mark Parkinson chose Biggs to fill the vacancy. Biggs was only the second (after Larry Ryan) Democratic Secretary of State in Kansas since statehood, and was the first in nearly 60 years. 2010 Election Biggs faced a primary challenge for the Democratic nomination for Secretary of State by Kansas State Sen. Chris Steineger, whom he defeated with a 60%-40% victory in the August 3rd election. On the Republican side, a three-way battle for the nomination was won by Kris Kobach, a University of Missouri-Kansas City law professor and former Kansas State Republican Party chairman; he defeated Shawnee County Elections Commissioner Elizabeth Ensley and JR Claeys, capturing 51% of the vote. On November 2, 2010, Kobach defeated Biggs by a margin of 59%-37%. Personal life Biggs is an accomplished bluegrass musician. He has won several awards for his guitar-playing skills, including three straight third-place finishes at the National Flatpicking Championships held each year at the Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, KS. He was the Kansas Guitar Picking Champion in 1982, 1990, and 1994, as well as the Kansas Banjo Picking Champion in 1994. He has been involved in several civic organizations: Big Brothers and Big Sisters, Rotary International, the Kansas County and District Attorneys Association, the Kansas Bar Association, and the Kansas Bluegrass Association. Biggs lives in the Flint Hills with his son.

In addition to hourly Regional-Express trains and numerous freight trains, it is served by Intercity-Express trains during the day at half-hourly intervals with some gaps.  Route description ICE on the Seven Arch Bridge (Siebenbogenbrücke) in Fürth On its total length of just over 100 kilometres, the railway line has a total of 18 stations. The two endpoints of the line, Nuremberg Hbf and Würzburg Hbf, are served by fast long-distance services. The line runs through more than 80 curves in a landscape of low ranges. History The 86 km stretch from Fürth to Rottendorf near Würzburg was built in as a shortcut between the Ludwig South-North Railway in Nuremberg and Ludwig's Western Railway line in Wurzburg. This shortened the 155 km-long indirect route via Bamberg and Schweinfurt. The state railway initially had little interest in the connection, so initially private Committees considered plans for such a route. At first, in 1857, a proposal via Siegelsdorf, Windsheim, Marktbreit and Ochsenfurt had been favoured, which led to an alternative route being put forward from the Neustadt and Kitzingen area, which ultimately prevailed. Initially, short sections were built as sections of other rail lines: * 1 July 1854: Rottendorf–Würzburg, 8.0 km long, as part of the Ludwig Western Railway * 1 October 1862: Nürnberg–Fürth, 7.7 km long, with the partial relocation of the Ludwig South-North Railway on this section * 1 July 1864: the entrance to the new Würzburg station with the closing of the old Ludwig station. One of Germany's oldest locomotive shed (the section on the right, built with the line to Würzburg in 1862/65) is located on the line in Fürth and closed. Construction began in 1861 and was completed in 1864. Only the viaduct in Emskirchen was not finished due to the difficult ground conditions. The Nuremberg–Würzburg railway was finally completed with opening of the 86.6 kilometre-long Fürth–Rottendorf section on 19 June 1865. At the same time the eight km-long section between Rottendorf and Würzburg was duplicated. In the summer of 1985 a third track was added to this section. On 1 July 1886, a heavy head-on collision of two trains took place between Würzburg and Rottendorf, causing the death of 16 people. On 8 December 1889, the Bavarian State Parliament approved the doubling of the single-track line between Fürth and Rottendorf, which was completed by 1891. On 10 June 1928 at 02:30, the locomotive of the night train D 47, a class S3/6, derailed while crossing the Zenngrund bridge shortly before the entry to Siegelsdorf station. The locomotive crashed down the embankment and the carriages followed it. This killed 24 people. The Aurach viaduct in Emskirchen was renovated 1939, with the previous “fish-bellied” bridge (having lens-shaped iron trusses, similar to the Royal Albert Bridge) replaced by a steel box construction. In the Nazi period, the first preliminary work began to connect the line from Mainbernheim via a wye with the Würzburg–Treuchtlingen railway (near Marktbreit). Because of the Second World War, this project, which had already been considered in 1868 by the Royal Bavarian War Ministry, remained unfinished. Despite being bombed in February 1945, the bridge over the Main in Kitzingen was passable, but Wehrmacht soldiers blew it up along with the neighbouring bridge on the Kitzingen–Schweinfurt railway. Some wagons of a coal train that had broken loose fell into the Main. The northern abutment of the Aurach Bridge in Emskirchen was also blown up. The line was probably back in traffic from 15 October 1945. The electrification of the line began on 8 August 1952 with the installation of the first catenary mast in Neustadt (Aisch) station and it was formally opened on 2 October 1954 with a special train. A pilot installation of train radio, which had been approved in 1959, was introduced in 1962; this culminated in the nationwide introduction of the ZBF 70 system in 1974. In the 1960s, a number of level crossings were abolished or replaced by bridges and underpasses. Between 1965 and 1968, the previous push-button interlockings were replaced by automatic block signaling. As a result the hand-operated block and junction signal boxes at Kohlenhof, Rothenburger Straße and Neusünderbühl on the Nuremberg–Fürth section were replaced. Subsequently the branches were remotely controlled from Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof. The investment of DM 900,000 produced a return of 40 percent with the saving three old signal boxes and 15 signalmen. The stations of Sickershausen, Mainbernheim, Markt Einersheim and Hellmitzheim were closed for passenger operations in 1982 and Langenfeld station was closed in 1992. As one of the oldest railway lines in Germany, the line was declared overloaded in 2008. A new station was opened between Emskirchen and Neustadt (Aisch) as Neustadt (Aisch) Mitte (\\"central\\") station on 10 December 2012. It complements Neustadt (Aisch) station, which is poorly on the town's western outskirts. =Development= The line is double track throughout. The section between Nürnberg and Fürth was electrified on 15 May 1939 and Fürth to Wurzburg was electrified on 3 October 1954. The 19th century line had a minimum railway curve radius of 2,000 Bavarian feet (about 600 m) causing numerous speed limits of 100 km/h. Thus, today (as of 2015) the stations of Neustadt (Aisch) Rottendorf (Einfahrkurve) and Kitzingen can only be passed at 100 km/h. The first Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan, 1973) identified the line from Würzburg to Nuremberg and continuing to Augsburg as one of eight railway development projects. The same route was included in its update, \\"the coordinated investment program for federal transport\\" in 1977 as one of six development projects. The upgrade package consisted of 115 individual measures. The aim of the project was, above all, in the capacity expansion. Further development was foreseen as part of the ABS/NBS Würzburg–Nürnberg–München, which was included as one of 13 new projects that were identified as urgent needs in the 1985 Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan. The Nuremberg–Würzburg line was designated as project ABS 8/2. Planning for line improvements was underway by 1990. Different parts of the line were upgraded from 1992. The line was upgraded for operations with active tilting technology in 2007. The ICE T, which has operated on the line since December 2007, was thus able to operate on sections faster than trains without tilting technology, before problems with their axles put an end to high-speed operations in 2008. 1976–1987 upgrade 115 individual measures were planned in the first stage of the upgrade, as part of the ABS 8 project. In addition to the upgrade of the Würzburg–Rottendorf section to three-tracks, eleven new platform accesses that avoided crossing railway tracks, continuous bi-directional signalling, shorter signalling blocks and adjustments and upgrades to the traction power supply were provided. Step-free platform access was created at the stations of Dettelbach, Kitzingen, Iphofen, Markt Bibart and Emskirchen. The third track between Würzburg and Rottendorf went into operation in July 1985. It is considered a continuation of the new line between Hannover and Würzburg. The section between Würzburg and Rottendorf was congested in the early 1980s. Although the line between Würzburg and Rottendorf had a nominal capacity of 240 trains per day (both ways), 290 passenger and freight trains operated on it on weekdays. During peak hours many freight trains had to be diverted or kept in sidings. In order for the line to deal with the expected increase in traffic as a result of the planned Hanover–Würzburg high-speed line, plans were developed in 1976 for a third track on the 8 km-long section. On 13 July 1979, the Federal Minister of Transport granted a permit to upgrade the track in accordance with the Federal Railway Act. The planning approval process that had been initiated at the beginning of 1979 was completed on 15 May 1980 with approval for the plan. After a lawsuit was settled out of court, the plan approval became legally binding on 11 May 1981. Construction began in 1980. The planned investment in 1984 was around DM 145 million (about €74 million, as of 1984). (14-sided Leporello list) The third track is operated as a single track line. The idea of building it in a balanced middle position between the two existing tracks had been rejected. Around DM 184 million was invested in the entire package of measures. The project was completed at the end of the 1980s with the exception of some finishing details. The cost of the third track was estimated at DM 71 million in 1989; DM 66 million of this was funded by the federal government.  1987–1999 upgrade  A number of measures were envisaged within the scope of the further upgrades envisaged in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan of 1985: in addition to the provision of alignment improvements and the shortening of blocks, short overtaking loops, level crossings and slow points (especially in Würzburg Hauptbahnhof) were to be eliminated. New and extended substations were planned as well as reinforced power supply. The Linienzugbeeinflussung cab signalling and train protection system would be installed and a freight detour route (Würzburg–Ansbach–Nuremberg) would be developed. The cost of the project was estimated to be DM 272 million at 1985 prices. The ABS 8/2 upgrade project was divided into three sections: *On the 40.9 km-long section between Nuremberg and Neustadt (Aisch), worthwhile investments would raise the permissible speed by up to 30 km/h to 160 km/h. Exit speeds in Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof would be raised from 30-40 to 80 km/h by the installation of more gradual turnouts. *The core of the project was the upgrading of the 28.8 km-long section between Neustadt (Aisch) and Iphofen. With 14 line improvements, a continuous top speed of 200 km/h would be achieved. Movements of 20 to 65 m were required at six curves and movements of at most 4 m were required at the remaining curves. In Neustadt (Aisch) station, the passing track would be extended to an effective length of 750 m. Four level crossings would be eliminated. *On the 32.5 km-long and especially curvy section between Iphofen and Würzburg greater speed increases were not possible. On five sections, speed increases of 10 km/h to 140 km/h were intended. In Kitzingen station, the effective length of the passing track would be extended to around 750 m. *In Würzburg Hauptbahnhof , exit speeds for long-distance trains to Nuremberg would be increased from 40 to 60 km/h and parallel entry options from Nuremberg and Bamberg would be created. The preliminary plans for the project was submitted to the Bundesbahn headquarters on 31 May 1987 and planning approval was granted on 18 November 1988. Completion was scheduled for 1996. Work on the line began with a formal groundbreaking ceremony on 3 April 1992 and was scheduled to be completed by 1997. Upgrade works in Würzburg Hauptbahnhof had begun as early as 1989. As a result of line improvements, the speed in the section between Neustadt (Aisch) and Iphofen was raised by 40 to 60 km/h to 200 km/h by May 1999; this also required the installation of the Linienzugbeeinflussung system. At the same time measures were taken to increase the entry and exit speeds at Würzburg Hauptbahnhof. The improvements allowed a travel time reduction for long- distance traffic of about seven minutes. Away from the high-speed section, smaller increases in speed were realised, for example, by raising the cant up to 160 mm, minor changes to transition curves and shifts of tracks of up to 60 cm. In the area of Elgersdorf (line-kilometres 19.6 to 20.5) the line was moved by up to 25 m. The maximum speed on the section was raised to 140 km/h. As part of the upgrade, Markt Bibart station was equipped with two external platforms and a crossover and a turnback track were built for commuter trains. With the widening of a curve (km 47, previous radius: 1095 m), the maximum speed was raised from 140 to 200 km/h. The existing central passing loop was removed during reconstruction in 1992/1993. An overtaking facility to be provided as a replacement (with two overtaking tracks) near Oberlaimbach has not been realised (as of 2015). A passing loop with an effective length of 750 m was built between the main tracks at Markt Einersheim. Plans to install the Linienzugbeeinflussung system on the high-speed section to increase capacity have not been implemented. An extension of the high-speed section would have made the Linienzugbeeinflussung system here unusable. The investment in the high-speed section was about DM 160 million (about €80 million, 1999 prices), with a travel time reduction of about three minutes. About DM 75 million (about €38 million) was invested in the other measures, with a travel time reduction of about one and a half minutes. Due to a lack of funding, plans for further upgrading of the line estimated to cost €140 million were abandoned at the end of 2004.  New Aurach viaduct The Aurach viaduct in Emskirchen was rebuilt from May 2014 to November 2016. This 527.5 m-long and 40 m-high bridge made of reinforced concrete replaced the old bridge and lies about 90 m north of it. The route was changed over a length of 1.75 km. The solution had been identified in an EU-wide planning competition. An improvement in the alignment allowed speeds over the new bridge to be raised from 110 to 140 km/h for conventional trains and from 140 to 160 km/h for tilting trains. Planned new alignment The list of \\"urgent needs\\" identified in the Federal Transport Plan of 1992 included a new line between Iphofen and Rottendorf as part of proposed upgrades on the Hanau–Nantenbach/Würzburg–Iphofen route, which were estimated to cost DM 1.495 billion. The 24 kilometre-long new line would run off the existing line west of Rottendorf station and initially pass under a ridge through the 3.5 km-long Galgenberg Tunnel, pass over an overtaking loop at Biebelried and cross the Main on a nearly 800 m-long bridge south of Kitzingen. Near Markt Einersheim the new line would connect with the section towards Neustadt (Aisch) / Nuremberg, which is designed for 200 km/h operations. The route, which was originally designed for 300 km/h and later for 250 km/h operations, would shorten the travel times between Iphofen and Würzburg by a third, from around 20 minutes to 13 minutes, as several tight bends, especially between Kitzingen and Würzburg and near Iphofen, do not currently allow high speeds. The estimated cost was DM 840 million. The existing line between Rottendorf and Iphofen would have only been used for Regional-Express service after the planned commissioning of the new line in 2003. The new line would have been used by 109 long-distance passenger and freight trains each day and each way. The affected communities opposed the building of the planned new line during consultations around 2001. The main argument put forward was that it crossed the drinking water protection area of the Franconia water supply. Also, the estimated cost of DM 850 million and the ecological sensitivity of the areas crossed by the proposed line were emphasised. Due to a decline in traffic, preliminary work the project around 2000 was not pursued. =Extra tracks between Nuremberg and Fürth= A groundbreaking ceremony was held on 10 August 2006 for the building of two extra tracks between Nuremberg and Fürth to provide four tracks. This is a €162 million project related to the Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed line project and the extension of the Nuremberg S-Bahn to Forchheim. While the bulk of passenger traffic will continue to be carried on two tracks, a new track is necessary for freight traffic in order to create capacity for the S-Bahn. A third track has been available between Nuremberg and Fürth for the S-Bahn since 18 December 2010. All four tracks have been in use since 21 November 2011  S-Bahn  In the course of the second stage of the Nuremberg S-Bahn (planning status: 1981), it was planned to establish S-Bahn operations on the section between Fürth and Siegelsdorf, which would be upgraded. (12-sided Leporello list) In addition, planning investigations were carried out in 1987. (29 page brochure with situation of September 1987) These plans have not been implemented so far (as of 2013). An upgrade to three tracks between Siegelsdorf and Fürth is planned in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan for 2030.. Electronic interlockings were opened in Siegeldorf and Emskirchen 2014, so that only the Neustadt–Altmanshausen section is not controlled by such interlockings. Services Deutsche Bahn modus EMU, running as RegionalExpress Franken- Express between Nuremberg and Würzburg, near Markt Bibart. =Long-distance= In long-distance traffic, the Intercity-Express line 25 (Munich–Hamburg) operates every two hours and line 41 (Munich–Ruhr district) every hour. In addition, services from Frankfurt to Vienna were greatly expanded in December 2007, with ICE-T services running every two hours from Frankfurt (some continuing from Dortmund) to Vienna and vice versa. The InterCity train pair, Rottaler Land, running from Hamburg to Passau and Mühldorf, unlike the other long-distance trains, also stopped in Neustadt (Aisch) on Saturdays until December 2014. Different ICE classes are used for the three ICE services; Intercity services are mostly operated as push–pull trains hauled by Class 101 and Class 120 locomotives. =Regional and local transport= The former Franken-Express Regional-Express service ran hourly between Nuremberg and Würzburg. Until December 2006, the trains operated to/from Frankfurt (Main). The direct connections introduced for the summer timetable 2001 were split into two lines with the same interchange connections in Würzburg. DB-Regio has operated Alstom Coradia Continental (class 440) sets under the brand name Mainfrankenbahn, which has existed since the timetable change 2010, as Regionalexpress services (between Nuremberg and Würzburg) and as Regionalbahn services (between Nuremberg and Neustadt (Aisch)). These sets are based in Würzburg. Services are denser in the vicinity of Nuremberg. LINT sets run between Nuremberg and Siegelsdorf, continuing over the Zenn Valley Railway to Markt Erlbach. A total of eight pairs of Regionalbahn services operate from Monday to Friday during peak hours between Kitzingen and Würzburg. These are operated with class 425 sets. Because both Regional-Express and Regionalbahn services stop at all stations in this corridor, there are services at 30-minute intervals at times. With the Bayerische Eisenbahngesellschaft mbH (Bavarian Railway Company, BEG) putting operations on this line to tender, there has been some increase of services in the off-peak (especially in the evening and at the weekend). The number of passengers on regional services on the line increased by 220 percent between 2003 and 2012 according to the Bayerische Eisenbahngesellschaft.  Tenders for public transport services  The Bayerische Eisenbahngesellschaft, which is responsible for procuring regional passenger services has awarded contracts for all Regional-Express and Regionalbahn services on the Nuremberg–Würzburg railway following the calling of tenders. First, the operation of the so-called Nürnberger Dieselnetzes (Nuremberg diesel network)—which also includes the Regionalbahn service from Nuremberg to Neustadt (Aisch)—was advertised on 2 March 2005 and awarded to DB Regio AG on 21 October 2005. With a view to increasing the attractiveness of the service, LINT 41 diesel railcars were procured from Alstom Transport Deutschland, and regional trains were to be extended via Neustadt (Aisch) to Steinach (bei Rothenburg) and Rothenburg ob der Tauber. In addition, it was planned to uncouple portions of the trains in Siegelsdorf station and to let a portion run on the Zenn Valley Railway to Markt Erlbach. However, the portion working concept was rejected and instead additional Alstom Coradia Continental services were commissioned. The integration of the services was not possible because not enough diesel vehicles were available. The contract began in December 2008 and has a term of ten years. The Nuremberg–Würzburg Regional- Express service was tendered by the Bayerischen Eisenbahngesellschaft as part of the E-Netzes Würzburg (Würzburg electric network) on 7 June 2006. A DB Regio subsidiary won the tender and started operations in December 2009 with new electric railcars. The new contract includes an increase of 132,000 train- kilometres per year, so that a continuous hourly service would be offered until 11 pm. Under the E-Netz Würzburg contract, the new services on the Nuremberg–Würzburg line started in December 2009 and services on the remaining routes started in December 2010 and will all end in December 2021.  Fare zones When the Verkehrsverbund Großraum Nürnberg (Greater Nuremberg Transport Association, VGN) was established on 27 September 1987, the line between Nuremberg and Neustadt an der Aisch was in its tariff area, it was extended to Markt Bibart on 31 May 1992, to Iphofen on 10 December 2006, to Kitzingen on 9 December 2007 and lastly to Dettelbach Bahnhof on 1 September 2016. Between Iphofen and Dettelbach the line lay in the tariff area of Kitzinger Nahverkehrs-Gemeinschaft (Kitzing local transport association, KiNG), until the district of Kitzingen joined the Verkehrsunternehmens-Verbund Mainfranken (Main-Franconia transport association, VVM) on 1 February 2009 after years of coordination problems. Until the beginning of the year, VVM fares was valid from Rottendorf station. The Dettelbach Bahnhof–Markt Bibart section is now located in the areas of both the VGN and the VVM.

Walworth was one of the founders of the Daughters of the American Revolution and was the organization's first secretary general.WALWORTH, Ellen Hardin (Oct. 20, 1832-June 23, 1915) (1971) Notable American Women: 1607–1950, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, USA. Accessed from Credo Reference on 26 March 2010. She was the first editor of the DAR's official magazine, American Monthly Magazine. In 1893, during a speech at the World's Columbian Exposition (Chicago World Fair), Walworth was one of the first people to propose the establishment of the United States National Archives. Walworth was one of the first women in New York State to hold a position on a local board of education, a role that was frequently used to bolster the call for women's suffrage. During the Spanish–American War, Walworth and other influential women established the Women's National War Relief Association to offer aid to the war effort. Walworth, the impetus behind the organization, was the Director-general of new association. In her personal life, Walworth was a victim of domestic violence with tragic consequences when her son, Frank, killed his father after years of intervening to protect his mother. Walworth studied law to gain the knowledge to overturn the conviction of her son for killing her abusive former husband. Family life Portail of the death of Walworth's father, John J. Hardin, at the Battle of Buena Vista. Ellen Hardin was born on October 20, 1832, in Jacksonville, Illinois, into the well known Hardin family of Kentucky. She was the oldest of four siblings born to John J. and Sarah Ellen (Smith) Hardin. John's parents were Martin D. Hardin, a prominent statesman from Kentucky who served in the United States Senate, and Elizabeth Logan. John Hardin was a lawyer and a member of United States Congress as a member of the Whig Party. Great-granddaughter of John Hardin and Jane Davies. Also descendant from Gen. Benjamin Logan. Ellen was educated at Jacksonville Academy. Additionally, Ellen was heavily influenced by the wide supply of English literature and history reading materials which were offered in the family library. In 1846, John Hardin joined the United States Army to fight against Mexico and was killed in the Battle of Buena Vista. The family remained in Jacksonville until 1851 when Sarah Hardin married the Honorable Reuben Hyde Walworth, the last chancellor of New York State, and moved the family to Saratoga Springs, New York, to live on the family estate, Pine Grove. Many members of the Walworth family were converted to the Roman Catholic faith by a family member, Rev. Clarence A. Walworth, who was a missionary priest. After moving to Pine Grove, Ellen changed her religious affiliation from Presbyterian to Roman Catholic. =Marriage and domestic life= Reubena Hyde \\"Ruby\\" Walworth In 1852, Ellen married Mansfield Tracy Walworth, her stepfather's youngest son, and resided with him at Pine Grove. Mansfield Walworth was a lawyer by training who was a prolific writer and gained minor fame as novelist. Ellen and Mansfield had six children in rapid succession: Francis Hardin, John J., Mary Elizabeth, Ellen Hardin, Clara Teresa, and Mansfield Tracy. Two children were born later, Reubena Hyde and Sarah Margaret. Her daughter Reubena died of typhoid fever while nursing soldiers at Fort Monroe and Montauk Point. Her tombstone reads: \\"She served her flag -- not as a man, but better still: as only woman can.\\" Fortress Monroe Montauk, Spanish–American War, 1898. It was erected by the Daughters of the American Revolution, of which both mother and daughter were member. Walworth's husband was an \\"unstable person\\" with a \\"violent temper\\" who physically assaulted her. In 1861, she separated from her husband and moved with her children to live on a farm near Louisville, Kentucky. After several failed attempts to reconcile, she went to Washington in 1868, and secured a government clerkship. Walworth tried reconciling one last time after she lost her job, but she left him permanently in January 1871 after he physically assaulted her while she was pregnant with Sarah Margaret. She returned to Saratoga, and obtained a \\"limited divorce\\". =Frank Walworth's murder of Mansfield Walworth= After the divorce, Mansfield Walworth continued to threaten his former wife. After failed attempts by family members to intervene on her behalf, on June 3, 1873, her oldest son, Frank, shot his father to death in a New York City hotel room. After a widely publicized trial that included Ellen Walworth testifying on behalf of her son, Frank was sentenced to life imprisonment on July 5, 1873. Following the conviction, Walworth \\"devoted herself to securing his release which she achieved in 1877 on the ground of insanity.\\" In August 1877, New York Governor Robinson pardoned Frank Walworth on the grounds that the prisoner was not legally responsible for the crime due to insanity. Walworth studied law to gain the knowledge needed in order to overturn the conviction of her son. Career In order to bring in a stable income for the family, Walworth opened the family homestead, first as a boarding school for young women, and then later as a summer hotel. According to the New York Times (April 30, 1896) Walworth earned her law degree in 1896 at New York University Walworth did not practice law. For a short time, she was employed as a clerk for the United States government in Washington, D.C. Writer Walworth wrote constantly on historic subjects. She was an authority on the battlefields of Saratoga and also published an account of the Burgoyne campaign. Walworth was interested in science, in particular geology, and was among \\"the few women of her time to present a paper to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\\" Her paper, \\"Field Work By Amateurs\\" was presented at the August 1880 Conference in Boston and published in Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In the paper, Walworth passionately advocated for more popular science work done by and with amateurs, especially more participation by women. Community service During the final decades of the 19th century and early into the 20th century, membership in community organizations was an important part of professional and social life in the United States. Being a woman, Walworth by normal conventions, was excluded from membership in many prominent organizations. To overcome this issue, women either pressed to join these organizations, or established alternative organizations. Walworth did both, with the Daughters of the American Revolution being a notable example of women creating a new organization after being excluded from membership in prominent patriotic lineage organizations. Walworth joined and founded community organizations that reflected her interests in history. She identified as a suffragist but was not heavily involved with the women's suffrage movement. Instead, she joined numerous clubs that were previously exclusive to men, often being the first and sole female member. =Historic preservation= Walworth had a strong interest in the restoration and preservation of historical sites. She was on the forefront of the movement to raise public funds to purchase and restore historical properties. In 1876, Walworth advocated for funds to renovate George Washington’s home, Mount Vernon, near Alexandria, Virginia. Walworth was active in the Saratoga Monument Association and for 18 years she was the only female trustee in the organization. She was chair of the committee on tablets, and undertook the task of researching the battles and soliciting funds to place a marker at each site. On July 12, 1893 at the World's Columbian Exposition she presented her paper, The Value of National Archives to a Nation’s Life and Progress to the American Historical Association arguing for the creation of a national archives in the United States. =Daughters of the American Revolution= After being excluded from the Sons of the American Revolution, a men's patriotic lineage organization, a group of women in the nation's capital, including Walworth, formed their own organization, the Daughters of the American Revolution, in October 1890. Walworth was the first editor of the official publication of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the American Monthly Magazine, serving as editor from the spring of 1892 until July 1894. =Women's National War Relief Association= The Women's National War Relief Association was a relief organization founded during the Spanish–American War to give comfort to the officers, soldiers and sailors in the United States Military. During the Spanish–American War, Walworth and other influential women established the Women's National War Relief Association to collect monetary donations and to offer aid to soldiers. Walworth, the impetus behind the organization, was the Director-general of new association. Death and legacy The Founders of the Daughters of the American Revolution honors Walworth and the other co-founders of the DAR. Walworth died in Georgetown University Hospital in Washington on June 23, 1915, and was buried at Greenridge Cemetery, Saratoga, New York. On April 17, 1929, under the leadership of President General Grace L. H. Brosseau, the Daughters of the American Revolution dedicated a memorial to its four founders, including Walworth. The memorial was sculpted by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and is located at Constitution Hall in Washington D.C. http://www.dcmemorials.com/index_indiv0000930.htm A marble bust of Walworth was sculpted by Adelaide Johnson and was put in Memorial Continental Hall, Washington, D.C to honor her. Walworth is included in biographic books and papers about women who were trailblazers. In 2002, Allison P. Bennett wrote a biography about Walworth called Saratoga Sojourn: a biography of Ellen Hardin Walworth. The book primarily covers the time period and events from when Walworth relocated to Saratoga with her mother, her domestic life with Mansfield, her son's murder of his father, and her mission to overturn his murder conviction. Along the way Bennett tells about the life of a woman who was ahead of her times with her interests and accomplishments as a businesswoman, writer, historian, women's rights activist, and community organizer. The Walworth Memorial Museum is housed in the Saratoga Springs History Museum. The seven room museum includes material about the lives of Ellen Hardin Walworth and her family.

It includes the genera Hongshanornis (the type genus) and Tianyuornis from the Yixian Formation of Inner Mongolia, Longicrusavis from the Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province, Parahongshanornis from the Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning Province, and Archaeornithura, the oldest known member, from the Huajiying Formation of Hebei Province.  Description  Hongshanornithids were small, approximately the size of modern phoebes. Their legs are proportionally long in comparison to the wings, suggesting that they were aquatic wading birds. They most likely lacked beaks and had teeth in their jaws.  Classification  Hongshanornithidae was defined as a node-based clade including the last common ancestor of Hongshanornis longicresta and Longicrusavis houi plus all its descendants. Beginning in 2012, several studies began to find that the hongshanornithids were more closely related to songlingornithids (yanornithiformes) than to other early birds, making them part of the same clade.

The entrance of the Main Building of the Ministry of Defence (MoD), flanked by its monumental Earth and Water statues, opens onto the Avenue. A statue of a Gurkha soldier, unveiled in 1997, stands as a memorial in front of the Ministry of Defence. History The Avenue falls entirely within the area once occupied by the Palace of Whitehall, which was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1698, save for the now historic listed building, Banqueting House. It was originally a narrow street called Whitehall Yard on which stood a number of houses, most notably Carrington House, the residence of Lord Carrington. The building was demolished in 1896 to make room for the widening of the street preparatory to the construction of the War Office building. The Avenue was planned as part of a subsequent project to build a large Government building, begun in 1909 but not completed until 1951. On completion, the Avenue formed the northern boundary of this new building, which since 1964 has been used as the Main Building of the Ministry of Defence (MoD).Ministry of Defence, Main building. Road layout Horse Guards Avenue, running from west to east, connects the major north-south thoroughfares of Whitehall and Embankment. Beginning at a T junction with Whitehall at a point opposite the Horse Guards building, the Avenue continues eastward to another T junction on Embankment. Approximately long, it provides for a single lane of widely separated traffic in each direction, with a slight curve bowing its course to the north midway along. Other than Whitehall and the Embankment, the only other public road connecting with the Avenue is Whitehall Court, a one way road joining the Avenue from the north as another T-Junction, midway along its length. A small private access road, Whitehall Gardens, is located at its western end, running south. Horse Guards Road is not connected to Horse Guards Avenue, being approximately away beyond the Horse Guards building and parade ground. Adjoining buildings The Avenue is overlooked by four buildings - the MoD Main Building and Banqueting House on the south side separated by Whitehall Gardens, and the Old War Office Building and Whitehall Court on the north side, separated by Whitehall Court road. The north frontage of the MoD building and its entrance dominates the south side of the Avenue, with the smaller Banqueting House situated to the west in the corner with Whitehall. To the north, the Old War Office building lies on the west side of Whitehall Court road fronting onto Whitehall, while the Whitehall Court building lies on the opposite side. Towards Embankment, the frontages of both the Whitehall Court building and MoD building end at the same place, with the Avenue continuing on to the junction with Embankment through the public gardens which line the west side of Embankment. Other landmarks Charles Wheeler's architectural sculptures of Earth and Water A statue of Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire by Herbert Hampton stands in the middle of the Avenue at the Whitehall end, facing Horse Guards. Opposite the MoD building entrance stands the Gurkha Monument, on the corner of the Avenue and Whitehall Court road, with the soldier statue facing west looking towards Whitehall. Sculpted by Philip Jackson, it was unveiled in 1997 by Queen Elizabeth II. The entrance to the MoD building itself is flanked by two monumental statues, Earth and Water, by Charles Wheeler. IRA mortar attack Horse Guards Avenue was the launch site of the IRA's 1991 Downing Street mortar attack. A transit van was parked on the Avenue near the corner with Whitehall, and the mortar launch occurred minutes later. The incident led to a ban on street parking in the area.

Designed to bring together the leading 48 players in English women's cricket, it originally composed solely of a 50-over tournament, but in 2004 a Twenty20 competition was added. The tournament, which was created to bridge the gap in quality between the Women's County Championship and international cricket, first featured non-English players in 2008, when Australians Alex Blackwell and Leah Poulton were invited to take part. The competition was not held in 2009 or 2010 due to a busy international schedule caused primarily by the ICC World Twenty20. The two competitions consist of four teams, originally named the Braves, the Knight Riders, the Super Strikers and the V Team, but renamed to the Sapphires, Diamonds, Rubies and Emeralds in 2006. The Sapphires (previously the V Team) have been the most successful team, winning both the 50-over and the Twenty20 competitions on three occasions. Charlotte Edwards dominated the first four years of the competition, finishing as the leading run-scorer each time. Tournaments =2002= Charlotte Edwards was the leading run-scorer in three of the first four years of the competition. In the inaugural tournament, a team-building exercise was initially held at Trent Bridge, at which four teams were selected from the 48 players invited. These teams; the Braves, the Knight Riders, the Super Strikers and the V Team, then faced each other in six contests held across five weekends. The Braves won four of their matches to win the competition, captained by Clare Connor, who also captained the England women's cricket team. The batting was led by England team-mates Charlotte Edwards and Claire Taylor, of the Knight Riders and the Super Strikers respectively, who both scored in excess of three hundred runs. Connor had the best bowling average in the competition, taking her seven wickets at 9.28, but Gill Richards of the V Team claimed the most wickets, taking eleven in total. =2003= For the 2003 competition, the teams kept the same core of players as they had held the previous season. The first round of matches were rained off, allowing each team to only contest five games. The Knight Riders, captained by Edwards, won four of these five matches to win the tournament. Edwards herself was the again the competition's leading run-scorer, aggregating 199 runs, though Lydia Greenway's average of 54.00 was the highest of the tournament. Marsha Davies, also of the Knight Riders, boasted the best bowling average, with eight wickets at 10.62, but Lucy Pearson took the most, claiming ten wickets. =2004= In 2004, the competition was refreshed: whites were replaced with coloured clothing, and a Twenty20 competition was introduced over one weekend in May. The V Team, captained by Laura Newton, won both tournaments. They won three matches, lost two and tied one in the main competition to narrowly finish top of the table, and enjoyed victories over the Knight Riders in the semi-finals and the Braves in the final to win the Twenty20. For the third consecutive season, Edwards scored the most runs in the competition, scoring 386 runs. Clare Taylor was the most prolific wicket- taker, claiming 14 wickets at 13.50. =2005= While the main tournament retained the same format for 2005, the Twenty20 competition altered slightly, adopting a short round-robin style league. The V Team retained their Twenty20 crown, winning all three of their matches. In the fifty over competition, the games were held over three weekends, and the Knight Riders emerged victorious; their captain, Edwards, once more finishing with the most runs in the tournament with 428. Newton took 13 wickets to lead the bowlers. =2006= The teams were rebranded and renamed for the 2005 competition; the original teams were replaced by the Sapphires, Diamonds, Rubies and Emeralds. Writing for Cricinfo, Jenny Thompson was scornful of the change, describing the names as \\"namby-pamby\\". In addition to the name changes, the team kits were \\"more stylish and flattering\\" according to chief executive Gill McConway. The teams were also selected based loosely on geography, giving each team more of an identity. The Sapphires (previously the V Team) won the competition, emerging victorious in four of their six matches. Claire Taylor finished as the competition's leading run-scorer with 426 runs, the first time Edwards had not taken the accolade, though she did finish second. Newton took the most wickets for the second consecutive year, claiming nine at an average of 23.55. The Twenty20 competition reverted to its original format of two semi-finals and a final, and was won by the Diamonds (formerly the Knight Riders) who beat the Rubies and the Sapphires on their way to victory. =2007= The Twenty20 competition was abandoned without a match played or a ball bowled in 2007 due to adverse weather conditions during the Whitsun weekend on which it was scheduled. In the main competition, the Rubies became the first team to win all their matches during the tournament to finish as winners. Both the leading batsman and bowler were drawn from the Rubies' side; Lydia Greenway's 233 runs led the competition, while the 19 wickets taken by Holly Colvin, at an average of 4.05, was 10 more than any other bowler managed. =2008= Leah Poulton (pictured) and Alex Blackwell were the first non-English players to compete in the Super Fours, in 2008. In 2008, Australians Leah Poulton and Alex Blackwell were invited to compete in the competition, the first time any non-English players had taken part in the tournament. The move was made both to improve the quality of the competition, and to strengthen ties with Cricket Australia, in order that more English players might be able to compete there during the English winter. Poulton finished the competition as the leading run-scorer, appearing for the Sapphires, who won the 50-over competition, winning three of their four completed matches. The Twenty20 competition was won by the Rubies, for whom Blackwell played. =2011= Due to busy international schedules, the competition was shelved in both 2009 and 2010. It returned in 2011, when it was won by the Rubies. The Twenty20 competition, which once again followed the semi-final and final format was won by the Sapphires, who beat the Rubies in the final. =Summary table= { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" + List of Super Fours winners !scope=\\"col\\"  Year !scope=\\"col\\"  Winner (50 overs) !scope=\\"col\\"  Winners (Twenty20) - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"2002  Braves  style=\\"background:#fcc;\\" Not competed - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"2003  Knight Riders  style=\\"background:#fcc;\\" Not competed - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"2004  V Team  V Team - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"2005  Knight Riders  V Team - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"2006  Sapphires  Diamonds - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"2007  Rubies  style=\\"background:#fcc;\\" Abandoned - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"2008  Sapphires  Rubies - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"2009  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:#fcc; text-align:center;\\" Not competed - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"2010  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:#fcc; text- align:center;\\" Not competed - !scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\"2011  Rubies  Sapphires } See also * Women's County Championship References Category:Women's cricket competitions in England Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2002 Category:2002 establishments in England ","title":"Super Fours"},{"id":"26703577","text":"The 2012 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament was played initially at campus sites for the opening round on March 6, 2012 and subsequently at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey from March 9 through March 11, 2012. It was the sixth consecutive year that the tournament was hosted in Boardwalk Hall, matching the longest streak at one site since the tournament was held at the Spectrum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from 1997–2002. However, it was the tournament's final year in the run at Boardwalk Hall, as the event moved to Brooklyn's new Barclays Center in 2013.

The first building at that location was probably built in the early 13th century by the Rudolf II von Rapperswil. The building in its present form dates aournd 1470. In 1614/15 the southern tower was added. Conversions respectively renewals were carried out in 1866 and 1895. In 1902 a further floor was added and the comprehensive wall decorations with figural and heraldic motifs (as shown on Alwina Gossauer's photograph of 1865 and that of 1901) on the west side were widely removed. Renewed conversions resulted in 1946/47, 1998/99 and 2007 to the present, rather plain appearance by largely removing of the elaborate decorations at the basements, except the south-facing sundial and the coat of arms under the ceiling.

As a result of the merger of the two political communities in 2007, the entire historical material until 1900 or 1950 will be stored at one site. As per August 2015, the city archives of Rapperswil (German: Stadtarchiv der Ortsgemeinde Rapperswil-Jona since 2007) therefore includes the historical documents of Rapperswil and Jona and its successors, mainly of the former Herrschaft Rapperswil, a bailywick, and of the House of Rapperswil. The city archives of the political community and the so-called Ortsgemeinde (citizenry) consist of several thousand documents, among them council and court records, some predominantly chronicles handwritten by clergymen, parish books and so on. Attached are the photo archives and the puncture and plan collection comprising some audio and film documents from the recent past, as well as private estates and a library, also location-based publications, including newspaper articles about Rapperswil since around 1950. The contents of the archives are accessible by telephone reservation.  History  Supraporta, once on the main gate of the Rapperswil Castle A first council and mayor (Schultheiss) in the medieval town of Rapperswil may be suspected for the period after its founding around 1220 AD. The earliest document sealed at the Rapperswil Castle, related to the donation of the church of Bollingen to the Rüti Abbey, mentions among others a civitas as witnesses of Count Rudolf von Rapperswil in 1229. Between 1267 and 1282, when the fiefs were given back by the German king to Elisabeth von Rapperswil, the citizens, clergy and nobility executed the representatives of Elisabeth's brother Count Rudolf III who died in 1267. The seal of the town of Rapperswil respectively citizenry first appeared in 1277. In 1337 Johann I von Laufenburg-Rapperswil died, that's probably why in 1341 the court council (German: Kleiner Rat) consisting of 12 members and the mayor (German: Schultheiss) was first mentioned in Rapperswil; since 1415 the council also appointed the Vogt of the Wurmsbach Abbey, a foundation of Countess Elisabeth's father and mother. Johann II von Laufenburg-Rapperswil had to sell Rapperswil and all rights to Hasburg in the late 1350s; Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, who rebuilt Rapperswil after the war with the city of Zürich and also re-established the prehistorical and Roman era lake crossing at the Seedamm isthmus, granted the citizenry the related customs legislation in 1360. King Wenceslas securitized liberation from foreign courts in 1379, and in 1406 the citizenry was allowed to elect their mayor. For the first time in 1442, the bicameral city government, being composed of the 12-seat Kleiner Rat and the 24-seat Grosser Rat, exercised the blood jurisdiction under the chairmanship of the mayor. Since 1481 the grand council was elected by the members of Kleiner Rat. Council genders include among others the Landenberg, Russinger (Russikon), Göldlin, Breny, Rothenfluh and Kunz families. Eis-zwei-Geissebei celebrated on Shrove Tuesday at Hauptplatz plaza For centuries the building served as the seat of the government respectively Rat (council) and later as the seat of the mayor (Bürgermeister) of Rapperswil ending on 31 December 2006, when the former independent cities of Jona and Rapperswil merged to form the municipality of Rapperswil-Jona. Since 1 January 2007, the Stadthaus Rapperswil-Jona that is situated in Jona, is the town hall of the municipality. Besides the restaurant, the city archives and the art exhibition, the Rathaus building is the center of an ancient Carnival festival: on Shrove Tuesday the traditional Herrenessen, the dinner of the council members and cabaret program with distinguished guests, is celcebrated on occasion of Eis-zwei-Geissebei when hundreds of children gather at the main square (Hauptplatz). Following the so- called Austeilete by the council members to the children, in the evening all regional Guggenmusik (carnival marching bands) gather at Hauptplatz and on Lindenhof at Schloss Rapperswil to celebrate a roaring concert.  Cultural heritage  Rathaus Rapperswil is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class A object of national importance, and its archives as Class B object of regional importance.

The series featured mixes of human and funny animal material. The series was edited by Steven Douglas with George L. Carlson as principal artist. Additional stories were drawn by David Tendlar. George Carlson George L. Carlson was in his mid-fifties and a veteran children’s book illustrator and puzzle maker when he took on Jingle Jangle Comics. His experience included painting the first edition dust jacket for Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind and ghosting the newspaper strip Reg’lar Fellas for artist Gene Byrnes. He had previously published Jingle Jangle Tales as a children’s book and an unsuccessful Sunday newspaper page. Each issue of the comic book contained at least one of his two features (and many contained both): \\"Jingle Jangle Tales\\" and \\"The Pie-Face Prince of Pretzelburg\\". Carlson completed every aspect of his features himself – pencils, inks, etc. – earning $25 per page for the twelve pages he produced for each issue. His stories included \\"The Youthful Yodeler and the Zig-Zag Zither\\", \\"The Fashionable Fireman and the Soft-Boiled Collar Button\\" and \\"The Extra Salty Sailor and the Flat-Footed Dragon.\\"  Analysis  Carlson’s sophisticated Jingle Jangle fairy tales mixed burlesque, fantasy, and wordplay with his own brand of nonsense in multi-layered features of visual and verbal harmony. Characters in his work included the Youthful Yodeler, the Half-Champion Archer, the Very Horseless Jockey, King Hokum of Pretzleburg and his son the pie-face Prince Dimwitri, the Princess Panetella Murphy (Dimwitri‘s love), the Raging Raja (Dimwitri’s favorite enemy), and the Wicked Green Witch. Dimwitri’s adventures were many and varied: in one tale, he went aloft in an 18-carat balloon in search of a missing bass drum and in another he searched for the Doopsniggle Prize with his corned-beef flavored cabbage plant.

What is OPC Xi? OPC Xi can securely transport data among automation applications on separate computers. It can only run in .NET environments and thus not in all plant network environments. To transport data, Classic OPC relies on DCOM, however OPC Xi works with Windows Communication Foundation. This means that Managed code applications don’t need a .NET wrapper for DCOM interoperation, but a wrapper from COM to .NET on the server, adding complexity to the server environment. OPC Xi and Networks The use of WCF allows OPC Xi to be functional with small and large networks. OPC Xi can be configured for communication across firewalls and Network Address Translation (NAT). Security and OPC Xi In addition to the security implied in WCF (authentication, authorization and encryption), OPC Xi has additional security measures that restrict write, read, and subscribe access to servers.

Early life La Santa de Cabora was born in 1873. Her father was the owner of a \\"rancho\\" and her mother a 14-year-old ranch hand. Throughout her early life her father, for the most part, ignored her and she was raised by her bitter aunt and quiet mother. Folk icon In the fall of 1889 Urrea had a serious illness and began to experience religious visions. When she recovered she believed she had been given healing powers by the Virgin Mary, and she soon gained a following when 1200 people camped nearby to seek healing and observe miracles. Indigenous people began to call her \\"The Saint of Cabora\\". She drew criticism from church officials for giving informal sermons in which she drew attention to clerical abuses. It was reported in the church that she was \\"always friendly with the sick, especially with the poor, without ever getting angry, demonstrating an exemplary humility. A heroic, she is without rest from dawn until sometimes late at night, and caters patiently and personally with the angry, touching with her hands the most nasty sores, making her bed alongside some patients who suffered from infectious diseases such as phthisis, lazarinos [leprosy], and others.\\"Hermosillo, Sonora.

Zazueta, a Herculano López, obispo de Sonora. El Quiriego, Sonora, agosto de 1890. [Hermosillo, Sonora. Archive of the Cathedral Church of Hermosillo, 21st Ecclesiastic Government, Sonora Bishopric, 1890. Letter from the priest Adolfo M. Zazueta, to Herculano López, Bishop of Sonora. Quiriego, Sonora, August 1890.] The Mexican press began to cover her activities in December 1889, notably the newspaper El Monitor Republicano of Mexico City. Urrea predicted an impending flood that would destroy all places except a few she designated. One of the designated places was Jambiobampo, Sonora which was the center of preaching by Damian Quijano, a Mayo inspired by Urrea's teaching whose father had been a general under Cajemé warring against the Mexicans.Edward H. Spicer, Cycles of Conquest (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1962) p. 75 Urrea was venerated as a folk saint among the Yaqui and Mayo peoples, who are indigenous to Sonoran Desert near the United States border. A drought in the states of Chihuahua and Sonora, along with economic and political instability, led the village of Tomochic, Chihuahua to seek her guidance. A violent confrontation occurred there between villagers and government authorities on December 7, 1891. A second village revolt on December 26 routed forty soldiers, and Urrea left the area to avoid being blamed for the incidents. Nonetheless, the government held her responsible and exiled Urrea and her father in May 1892. They settled in Nogales, Arizona. The Tomochitecos, however, continued their armed resistance against the government in her name. In response, government troops razed Tomochic in October 1892, and 300 villagers had died in the struggle by the end of that year. Some modern sources credit Urrea for the religious fervor with which the outnumbered Tomochitecos resisted government forces. Expulsion from Mexico Although the resistance fighters invoked Urrea's popular nickname, \\"Santa de Cabora\\", and sought her help, there is no direct evidence that she took part in their activities. Her popularity among insurgents appears to have been due to amateur sermons she had made about equality, justice, and brotherly love. Some sources assert that \\"she also made speeches inciting the people to fight for their land\\". Her extradition was undertaken as a military action by the Eleventh Regiment and the Twelfth Battalion of the Mexican army under General Abraham Bandala. The Urrea family departed without incident, but General Bandala reported to the Secretary of War that there was a risk of uprisings among the Mayo people due to Urrea's influence. Indigenous Mayos invoked her name when they attacked the city of Navojoa in Sonora in retaliation for the seizure of their lands. Urrea's arrival in Nogales received a hero's welcome. A crowd greeted her at the train station and local police escorted her to a hotel. Urrea and her father applied for United States citizenship soon afterward, although no record exists that either of them were granted it. Urrea spent the next three years living in a small community near Nogales where she resumed her folk healing. Border uprisings By November 1895 she had relocated to Solomonville, Arizona, where Lauro Aguirre and Flores Chapa had recently launched a newspaper El Independiente that was critical of the Porfirio Díaz regime. Aguirre and Chapa opposed the Díaz government practices of dispossessing indigenous people and silencing criticism. In February 1896 Aguirre and Chapa published a circular called Plan Restaurador de Constitucion y Reformista, which referenced the Tomochic rebellion and accused the Mexican government of having violated the 1857 constitution in a variety of ways. The Plan Restaurador called for the violent overthrow of the Díaz government. Twenty-three people signed the Plan Restaurador, some of whom were close to Teresa Urrea, and she was presumed to have been involved behind the scenes. Afterward the United States government tried and acquitted Aguirre and Chapa; Teresa Urrea's alleged involvement drew attention during the trial. After the trial Teresa Urrea relocated to El Paso, Texas, where Aguirre resumed publishing newspapers. The press in El Paso described her as \\"an apolitical spiritual healer\\" until popular revolts against the Díaz government erupted along the border in August 1896. On August 12, seventy indigenous Yaquis, Pimas, and other Mexicans raided the customs house of Nogales, Arizona in the name of \\"La Santa de Cabora\\". Three people died during the uprising, which was covered in both the Mexican and American press with implications that the rebellion was inspired by issues of Aguirre's newspaper El Independiente and photographs of Teresa Urrea. Reportedly, insurgents carried her photograph over their hearts in the belief it would protect them during the uprising. Sources contradict each other regarding the extent of Teresa Urrea's role in the Nogales revolt and in other uprisings that followed. Aguirre's newspaper represented her as an advocate of violent revolution, and published complaints against the Mexican government and clergy with her signature. Yet the El Paso Herald published a statement in which she distanced herself from the uprisings and resented the appropriation of her name for revolutionary purposes. It is uncertain whether the El Paso Herald statement expresses a genuine complaint or an attempt to distance herself from the consequences of actual political activities. The New York Times had attributed 1000 deaths in the border uprisings to her influence. Law enforcement and consular records from the period associate her with revolutionary activities, and the El Paso newspapers reported in January 1897 that the government of Mexico attempted to kill her. Shortly afterward she moved to Arizona. Later years Teresa Urrea married in 1900, but the bridegroom acted strangely on the wedding day and may have been involved with the Mexican government in another assassination plot against her. She married a Yaqui miner named Lupe Rodríguez who \\"brandished a rifle and tried to force Urrea onto a southbound train headed for Mexico\\". Local press portrayed Rodriguez as mentally unbalanced; the couple separated less than a day after the wedding ceremony. Shortly afterward Teresa Urrea went to California to treat a boy who had meningitis, and she entered a contract either with a San Francisco publisher or with a pharmaceutical firm to undertake a public tour as a healer. The tour had no lack of audience but encountered internal difficulties related to the language barrier and contractual obligations. Urrea gave a substantial part of her earnings to the poor and before the tour ended Urrea and her translator had become lovers. She bore a daughter in 1902. They settled in Los Angeles, where she openly supported Mexican workers who unionized and went on strike seeking equal pay. In 1904 she relocated to Ventura County, California, had a second child, and purchased a house. She died of tuberculosis in 1906. Urrea was buried in Clifton, Arizona. Further reading Urrea's life story is told in Teresita by William Curry Holden (1978) and is also the subject of three heavily researched historical novels: La insólita historia de la Santa de Cabora (1990) written by Brianda Domecq with an English translation by Kay S. García titled, The Astonishing Story of the Saint of Cabora (1998), The Hummingbird's Daughter (2005), and Queen of America (2011), the latter two written by Teresa Urrea's great-nephew, Luis Alberto Urrea.

Purpose It grew out of a desire for one common Creed, which was modified into the idea of a selected harmony. In this shape it was proposed by the Protestants of Zurich and Geneva. Jean-François Salvart, minister of the Church of Castres, is now recognized as the chief editor of the work with some assistance from Theodore Beza, Lambert Daneau, Antoine de la Roche Chandieu, and Simon Goulart. It was intended as a defense of Protestant, and particularly Reformed, doctrine against the attacks of Roman Catholics and Lutherans. It does not give the confessions in full, but extracts from them on the chief articles of faith, which are classified under nineteen sections. It anticipates Georg Benedikt Winer's method, but for harmonistic purposes. Content Besides the principal Reformed Confessions (i.e., the Tetrapolitan, Basel, Helvetic, French, Scots and Belgic Confessions), three Lutheran Confessions are also used, viz., the Augsburg Confession, the Saxon Confession (Confessio Saxonica), and the Württemberg Confession, as well as the Confession of the Unity of the Brethren (1573) and Anglican Confession (1562). The work appeared almost simultaneously with the Lutheran Formula of Concord, and may be called a Reformed Formula of Concord, though differing from the former in being a mere compilation from previous symbols.

It includes five species found from Bolivia to Uruguay and eastern Brazil, one of which is now extinct. Although the first species were discovered in 1931, the genus was not recognized as distinct from Gracilinanus until 2005. It includes small opossums with generally grayish, sometimes reddish, fur that are mainly distinguished from other opossums by characters of the skull. Taxonomy Species of Cryptonanus were first described in 1931 by George Henry Hamilton Tate,Voss et al., 2005, p. 5 who described Marmosa microtarsus guahybae (now Cryptonanus guahybae) as a subspecies of Marmosa microtarsus (now Gracilinanus microtarsus), Marmosa agilis chacoensis (now Cryptonanus chacoensis) as a subspecies of Marmosa agilis (now Gracilinanus agilis),Tate, 1931, p. 10 and Marmosa unduaviensis (now Cryptonanus unduaviensis) as a separate species.Tate, 1931, p. 11 In 1943, another species was described, Marmosa agricolai (now Cryptonanus agricolai).Gardner, 2009, p. 41 Species of Cryptonanus were then included in a broadly defined genus Marmosa until the genus Gracilinanus was described in 1989. The fifth currently recognized Cryptonanus species, C. ignitus, was described as a species of Gracilinanus in 2002. At that time, the species of Cryptonanus were variously regarded as separate species or as synonyms or subspecies of other species of Gracilinanus.Gardner, 2009, p. 40 Robert Voss and others noticed that some of the animals then classified in Gracilinanus had an additional foramen ovale, an opening in the skull that is formed by an extension of the bone of the alisphenoid tympanic wing towards the middle and front. They looked for other characters that correlated with the presence of the foramen and found them easy to find, defining a group of species distinct from Gracilinanus.Voss et al., 2005, p. 2 A phylogenetic analysis corroborated the distinctness of Cryptonanus and Gracilinanus.Voss et al., 2005, fig. 4 Voss and colleagues first noted the discovery in a footnote in their 2004 paper on ChacodelphysVoss et al., 2004, p. 6, footnote 4 and subsequently described the group of species with the additional foramen as a new genus, Cryptonanus. The generic name, Cryptonanus is derived from the Ancient Greek words κρυπτος kryptos (hidden) and νανος nanos (dwarf) and was chosen because Cryptonanus species are small and their true identity was long hidden by taxonomic synonymy.Voss et al., 2005, p. 11 Cryptonanus is currently classified in the tribe Thylamyini of subfamily Didelphinae within the opossums.Voss and Jansa, 2009 Voss and colleagues recognized each of the five names they referred to Cryptonanus—agricolai, chacoensis, guahybae, ignitus, and unduaviensis—as separate species, although they could find few distinguishing characters between them. Further research in this matter is needed.Voss and Jansa, 2009, p. 128 Species Cladogram of living Cryptonanus species. The five species currently recognized are: *Cryptonanus agricolai (states of Ceará, Goiás, and Minas Gerais in eastern Brazil) *Cryptonanus chacoensis (southeastern Bolivia, Paraguay, northeastern Argentina, and Uruguay)Gardner, 2009, pp. 41–42 *Cryptonanus guahybae (coastal Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil)Gardner, 2009, p. 42 *Cryptonanus ignitus (single locality in Jujuy, northwestern Argentina; extinct)Diaz and Barquez, 2008 *Cryptonanus unduaviensis (northern and eastern Bolivia)Gardner, 2009, p. 43 Description Cryptonanus species are small opossums even within their family and weigh about . The fur is unpatterned and usually reddish or grayish brown above and is grayish or unpigmented below. Guard hairs are poorly developed. A dark ring surrounds the eyes. On the forefeet, the third and fourth digits are longer than the second and fifth. Females lack a pouch and have 9 to 15 mammae. The tail looks naked to the unaided eye, but each scale in fact harbors three short hairs. Species of Cryptonanus and Gracilinanus are hardly distinguishable on external characters, though Cryptonanus species may have shorter tails, larger ears, broader eye-rings, and longer whiskers. More secure characters separate the skulls of the two genera.Voss et al., 2005, p. 6 In addition to the presence of the additional foramen ovale, which exhibits some variation within species,Voss et al., 2005, pp. 6–7 Cryptonanus usually lacks maxillary fenestrae, perforations of the palate near the first and second molars, has the second upper premolar shorter than the third,Voss et al., 2005, p. 7 lacks a rostral process, which extends the premaxillary bone further to the front,Voss et al., 2005, pp. 9–10 and usually has additional cusps on the upper canine tooth.Voss et al., 2005, pp. 10–11 The species of Cryptonanus differ in coloration, size, and some characters of the teeth.Gardner, 2009, pp. 40–41 The karyotype of C. agricolai includes 14 chromosomes with 24 major arms (2n = 14, FN = 24).Voss et al., 2005, p. 14 References Literature cited *Diaz M. and Barquez, R. 2008. .

It was built in 1891 by an unknown architect. House details Poulsen bought the property in July 1890 for $3,000, and the house was completed in August 1891. Poulsen sold the house immediately to S. B. Willey, probably either due to financial issues caused by the lead-up to the Panic of 1893 or because his wife, Dora, did not like it. He sold it on a mortgage to Willey and sold it outright to Arthur Zwicker for $7,500 on July 14, 1894. Alternately, the home was sold to William J. Clemens, an Oregon senator, in 1902. The house was built in 1891. The turret reaches approximately 50 feet. It includes a bedroom on the first floor for a servant. It contains two lead glass Oriel windows, a Palladian window, curved glass in the turret, and beveled lead glass windows. The home also contains a veranda, added around 1915. It is considered a \\"Pacific Northwest interpretation of the Queen Anne Style\\", since it does not contain stone or brick. The interior features a large carved oak fireplace and mantel, carved stairway balustrades, and oak flooring with a mahogany border. Containing nine bedrooms and 12-foot ceilings, the maid's bedroom is on the first floor, with four bedrooms on each of the second and third floors. The third floor may have originally been a large ballroom. The home was bought by \\"The Doughnut King\\", A. A. Hoover, in 1919, and became known as the \\"King's Castle\\" or \\"The King's Palace\\". The property was then sold to Henrietta B. Huthman in 1923, whose family owned it until 1946. The Huthman family added the two-car garage and large retaining wall in 1926. The two-car garage was connected to the house via tunnel. The home was converted to a boarding house sometime between 1946 and 1976. James F. Nevin purchased the house in approximately 1976 and began restoring it. The house was surveyed by the Portland Historical Landmarks Commission on October 3, 1973, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 14, 1977. In 2017, the Poulsen House was purchased as a home for Prospect, a Portland communications, design, government relations, & digital media agency. Prospect sold the house in 2019 Johan Poulsen Turret details of house Poulsen was born in 1849 as Johannes Poulsen in north Slesvig, Germany. The area of his birth is now Denmark. He came to Iowa in 1870, married his wife Dora in 1873, and came to Portland in 1875. Before 1890 he also owned part of the North Pacific Lumber Company and Willamette Steam Sawmill Company. He sold his ownership of these companies to start the Inman-Poulsen Lumber Company (which would eventually be absorbed into Georgia-Pacific) with Robert D. Inman. Their company had a sawmill on the east side of the Willamette River at Clinton Street. The sawmill dock could accommodate two oceangoing ships at a time. Inman had an almost identical house at 6th and Woodward Street, which was demolished in 1958 to make room for a parking lot. By 1903, the Inman- Poulsen company was the largest lumber company in Oregon with 350 employees, later peaking at 700 employees.

Арм. энциклопедии, 1991, c. 84 He was known for his battles alongside General Andranik Ozanian. Early Age Smbat was born in the city of Muş in 1875. When he was a child, his parents sent him to Saint Karapet Monastery to receive a formal education. During this time, Smbat became acquainted with the \\"Armenian Question\\". He became inspired by the stories he heard of Armenian guerrillas (feedayis) taking arms to defend their homeland. In the mid-1880s, Smbat and his friend Levon escaped from school to join the feedayis. He joined the Vardanantz group when aged 15.Armenia, the survival of a nation, by Christopher J. Walker, Croom Helm, 1980, p. 417 One of his first tasks was to move their bags and rifles because they did not initially trust him with a gun. Early Revolutionary Activities Makhluto was present throughout most of the major battles that took place in the Van-Taron region in the 1890s. He fought along with other feedayis such as Kevork Chavoush, Andranik Pasha, Keri, and Murad of Sebastia. During the Hamidian massacres of the Armenians in 1894-1896, Makhluto joined Andranik Pasha in mounting armed attacks against the Ottoman army and Ottoman Kurdish raiders to defend Armenian citizens under persecution. Makhluto also took up arms during the Sasun Uprising. After the Sassoun resistance, Andranik, Kevork Chavush, Sebastatsi Murad, and Makhluto, with another 200 fighters, went to Van. The Feedayis took positions on Akhtamar Island. The Turks discovered their whereabouts and sent several ships with heavy weaponry to capture and kill them. They successfully defeated the Turkish attacks. In the aftermath, the feedayis decided to split. One group went to Sassoun with Kevork Chavush, and the other group to the Caucuses via the Persian border with Andranik Pasha. In 1907, Makhluto was present during the Battle of Sulukh in which Kevork Chavoush was killed. In 1908, he was involved in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution with Yeprem Khan. In 1914, during the outskirts of World War I, Makhluto became General Andranik's fedayee commander in the Caucasus Campaign. The Armenian Genocide During the Armenian Genocide, Makhluto was one of General Andranik's deputy commanders.Dro (Drastamat Kanayan): Armenia's First Defense Minister of the Modern Era, by Antranig Chalabian, 2010, p. 146 From 1915-1916, Makhluto and Andranik were involved in the offensive battles in capturing Van. By 1916, Makhluto and Andranik had extended the Armenian frontier and participated in the Battle of Bitlis against Mustafa Kemal and in the Battle of Dilman. Makhluto was wounded and transferred to Tiflis. His wife was killed by the Turks.Armenia, the survival of a nation, by Christopher J. Walker, Croom Helm, 1980, p. 417 In 1917, the Bolshevik revolution had resulted in the withdrawal of Russian soldiers from the Armenian fronts. The Armenians began to form their own militias to guard the abandoned frontier. The situation deteriorated with the counter-offensive of Turkish troops within the Armenian highland. Andranik and Makhluto were forced to withdraw to Mush-Sassoun plains, where they took up defensive positions. By mid-1917, Makhluto was the commander of Khanous-Manaskert region. By late 1917 and early 1918, the renewed Turkish offensive had pushed the Armenian soldiers back to the frontier. Andranik and Makhluto shifted military strategies and moved most of their soldiers to defend and hold the Erzurum line of position. The First Republic of Armenia The result of the Turkish invasion of Armenia in 1918 forced Makhluto and his soldiers to withdraw to Sardarapat. Along with General Andranik, Makhluto was assigned to mobilize the defense of the Armenian border. During this period, their militia was in constant disagreement with the newly declared Armenian government, which was trying to sign a peace treaty with the Turks (Treaty of Batum). Makhluto and Andranik disagreed with the treaty because it would nullify Armenian claims to Western Armenia. During the Second Congress of Western Armenians (1919), Makhluto was elected as a member of the Executive Body, to function until the creation of a combined government of united Armenia.The Republic of Armenia: The first year, 1918-1919, by Richard G. Hovannisian, p. 454 After the Armenian government signed the Treaty of Batum, Makhluto and Andranik went to Zangezour to fight against Azeri militias that were rebelling against the newly created government. In 1920, Turkish revolutionaries led by Kazim Karabekir initiated the second invasion of Armenia. Makhluto received a military rank of general and was heavily wounded on 22 September 1920. The successful invasion and occupation of most Armenia resulted in the resignation of the government and the acceptance of the Sovietization of Armenia. The newly appointed Communist government began a severe crackdown on former Dashnak nationalists, politicians, and military personnel. Many were arrested and executed. On 13 February 1921, Makhluto (still wounded) went to Aragats-Talin region, and succeeded in assisting a revolt against the Communist regime in Armenia. On 17 February, Makhluto and his army occupied Yerevan, succeeding in a coup and establishing Simon Vratsian as Prime Minister. They managed to free many persecuted victims of the communist regime. The aftermath revealed that in Yerevan prison about 75 Armenian political and military prisoners were killed by Bolsheviks with axes and machetes. Amongst the dead were famous Armenian voluntary commander Hamazasp and Gabriel Korganyan. The successful Soviet occupation of neighboring Georgia resulted in a fear of a complete Soviet army take over and occupation of Armenia. The provisional government and the Bolsheviks came to an agreement, that there will no longer be any political persecutions if they were to discontinue coup activities and allow for the Sovietization of the newly formed Armenian nation. The provisional government disbanded with many of the coup members fleeing to other countries. Thus, on 2 April 1921, the Communists retook Yerevan. Later life Makhluto's bust in Jermuk, Armenia Makhluto's tombstone at Saint Gayane Church. Once the communists retook control of Yerevan, Makhluto fled to Syunik, eventually crossing the border into Persia. From Persia he emigrated to the United States, where he took up residence in Fresno, California. Once in the United States he met his former comrades, including General Andranik. In 1946, Makhluto emigrated to Soviet Armenia via France, where he had been temporarily living. The remaining 10 years of his life were spent peacefully in Yerevan where he worked as a housekeeper at the Komitas park. During this time he met with some of his volunteer army friends and with those who had been living abroad. Makhluto died in 1956 in his home from natural causes. Makhluto was buried near Saint Gayane Church in Vagharshapat (Etchmiadzin). His memories became the main idea of Khachik Dashtents' novel \\"Ranchparneri Kanche\\" (The Call of Plowmen).

Biggs, \\"The Ebla tablets: an interim perspective\\", The Biblical Archaeologist 43 (1980:76–87); Palace G in the excavation reports. of the ancient city of Ebla, Syria. The tablets were discovered by Italian archaeologist Paolo Matthiae and his team in 1974–75 during their excavations at the ancient city at Tell Mardikh.Hans H. Wellisch, \\"Ebla: The World's Oldest Library\\", The Journal of Library History 16.3 (Summer 1981:488-500) p. 488f. The tablets, which were found in situ on collapsed shelves, retained many of their contemporary clay tags to help reference them. They all date to the period between c. 2500 BC and the destruction of the city c. 2250 BC.Dumper; Stanley, 2007, p.141. Today, the tablets are held in museums in the Syrian cities of Aleppo, Damascus, and Idlib. Discovery and archaeological context The tablets were discovered just where they had fallen when their wooden shelves burned in the final conflagration of \\"Palace G\\". The archive was kept in orderly fashion in two small rooms off a large audience hall (with a raised dais at one end); one repository contained only bureaucratic economic records on characteristic round tablets, the other, larger room held ritual and literary texts, including pedagogical texts for teaching young scribes. Many of the tablets had not previously been baked, but when all were preserved by the fire that destroyed the palace, their storage method served to fire them almost as thoroughly as if in a kiln: they had been stored upright in partly recessed wooden shelves, rectos facing outward, leaning backwards at an angle so that the incipit of each tablet could be seen at a glance, and separated from one another by fragments of baked clay. The burning shelving pancaked - collapsing in place and preserving the order of the tablets.Succinctly described in Wellisch 1981:492. Language Two languages appeared in the writing on the tablets: Sumerian, and a previously unknown language that used the Sumerian cuneiform script (Sumerian logograms or \\"Sumerograms\\") as a phonetic representation of the locally spoken Ebla language. The latter script was initially identified as proto-Canaanite by professor Giovanni Pettinato, who first deciphered the tablets, because it predated the Semitic languages of Canaan, like Ugaritic and Hebrew. Pettinato later retracted the designation and decided to call it simply \\"Eblaite\\", the name by which it is known today. The purely phonetic use of Sumerian logograms marks a momentous advance in the history of writing.The point is briefly made by Stephen D. Cole, in a letter \\"Eblaite in Sumerian Script\\" in The Biblical Archaeologist 40.2 (May 1977:49). From the earlier system developed by Sumerian scribes, employing a mixed use of logograms and phonetic signs, the scribes at Ebla employed a reduced number of signs from the existing systems entirely phonetically, both the earliest example of transcription (rendering sounds in a system invented for another language) and a major simplifying step towards \\"reader friendliness\\" that would enable a wider spread of literacy in palace, temple and merchant contexts. Content and significance The tablets provide a wealth of information on Syria and Canaan in the Early Bronze Age,Four volumes of essays on the Ebla language and the archives were published by the Center for Ebla Research, New York University, as the series Eblaitica, begun in 1988. and include the first known references to the \\"Canaanites\\", \\"Ugarit\\", and \\"Lebanon\\". The contents of the tablets reveal that Ebla was a major trade center. A main focus was economic records, inventories recording Ebla's commercial and political relations with other Levantine cities and logs of the city's import and export activities. For example, they reveal that Ebla produced a range of beers, including one that appears to be named \\"Ebla\\", for the city. Ebla was also responsible for the development of a sophisticated trade network system between city-states in northern Syria. This system grouped the region into a commercial community, which is clearly evidenced in the texts. There are king lists for the city of Ebla, royal ordinances, edicts, treaties. There are gazetteers listing place names, including a version of a standardized place-name list that has also been found at Abu Salabikh (possibly ancient Eresh) where it was dated to c. 2600 BC.Giovanni Pettinato, \\"L'atlante geografico del vicino oriente attestato ad Ebla e ad Abū Salābikh\\", Orientalia 47 (1978:50-73). The literary texts include hymns and rituals, epics, proverbs. Many tablets include both Sumerian and Eblaite inscriptions with versions of three basic bilingual word-lists contrasting words in the two languages. This structure has allowed modern scholars to clarify their understanding of the Sumerian language, at that time still a living language, because until the discovery of the tablet corpus there were no bilingual dictionaries with Sumerian and other languages, leaving pronunciation and other phonetic aspects of the language unclear. The only tablets at Ebla that were written exclusively in Sumerian are lexical lists, probably for use in training scribes. The archives contain thousands of copybooks, lists for learning relevant jargon, and scratch pads for students, demonstrating that Ebla was a major educational center specializing in the training of scribes.Dumper; Stanley, 2007, p.142. Shelved separately with the dictionaries, there were also syllabaries of Sumerian words with their pronunciation in Eblaite. = Biblical archaeology = The application of the Ebla texts to specific places or people in the Bible occasioned controversy, focused on whether the tablets made references to, and thus confirmed, the existence of Abraham, David and Sodom and Gomorrah among other Biblical references. The sensationalist claims were made by Giovanni Pettinato and were coupled with delays in the publication of the complete texts, and it soon became an unprecedented academic crisis.Moorey, 1991, p.150–152. The political context of the modern Arab–Israeli conflict also added fire to the debate, turning it into a debate about the \\"proof\\" for Zionist claims to Palestine. However, much of the initial media excitement about supposed Eblaite connections with the Bible, based on preliminary guesses and speculations by Pettinato and others, is now widely deplored as generated by \\"exceptional and unsubstantiated claims\\" and \\"great amounts of disinformation that leaked to the public\\".Chavalas, 2003, P.40–41. The present consensus is that Ebla's role in biblical archaeology, strictly speaking, is minimal.

The company was founded in 1865 by Jefferson Thompson, and produces cheeses under the Marin French Cheese brand name. It is the oldest continually operating cheese manufacturer in the United States.  History  Early antecedents of the company may go back as far as 1854, although historical records from that era are sketchy. Other accounts state that a local woman named Clara Steele roped wild Spanish cattle in the area to make cheese starting in 1857. It is known that Jefferson Thompson established the current company in 1865, and his descendants continued the business for 133 years. The company used the Rouge et Noir brand name from 1906 until 2013, when the \\"Marin French Cheese\\" brand was created. Howard Bunce, former operations manager for the company, described their original product, \\"In the early years we made a granular cheese, it was a 'bar cheese' that was served to San Francisco dock workers – it was shipped by paddle wheeler down the Petaluma River to San Francisco.\\" In the 1930s, the dairy herd was decimated by disease, and was replaced by Jersey cows from Oregon. In 1998, Bob Thompson sold the business to the Boyce family of Bishop, California, operators of organic cattle ranches in eastern California and Nevada. Jim Boyce said that the company has a \\"symbiotic relationship\\" with the local dairy farmers who supply much of its milk. Mr. Boyce died in 2010 and, in 2011, Marin French was purchased by Rians, the respected French family of cheese producers that also owns Laura Chenel's Chèvre in neighboring Sonoma County.  Products  An assortment of Marin French Cheese Company products The company's original product in 1865 was a breakfast cheese, which was transported by horse-drawn carriage to Petaluma, and then carried by steamboat to San Francisco, where it was sold to waterfront dockworkers. They still manufacture this breakfast cheese. Other products include brie, camembert, chèvre, bleu and washed-rind triple creme Schloss. In 2015 Petite Breakfast wears the commemorative vintage label, “1865” to celebrate their 150th year and honor their cheesemakers who sustained the craft over decades.  Facilities  The Marin French Cheese Company is located on a dairy ranch in the Hicks Valley, and includes a cheese processing and retail sales facility, as well as a variety of barns, storage buildings and a picnic area. Although the company has a Petaluma address, it is located southwest west of that city. It is northwest of Novato. The company also conducts art exhibits at its location.  Agricultural heritage  The company collaborates with other local cheesemakers in Marin and Sonoma counties to support the annual California Artisan Cheese Festival, held in Petaluma. Former company's owner, Jim Boyce, describes their philosophy, \\"We remain dedicated to a rich heritage of artisan craftsmanship that has been passed down through the generations. Marin French Cheese Company now produces more than 40 different styles and varieties of cheese, yet each is handmade the same patient way, one cheese at a time, aged in the original hand dug cellar, and then hand weighed and packaged.\\" Awards In 2005, the company's Triple Creme Brie won top honors in the pasteurized milk brie category at the World Cheese Awards in London. This was the only gold medal awarded in the class that year.

A. 2011. Plant Fact Sheet for leadplant (Amorpha canescens). USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service, Manhattan Plant Materials Center. Manhattan, Kansas. It has very small purple flowers with yellow stamens which are grouped in racemes. Depending on location, the flowers bloom from late June through mid-September.Penskar, M.R. 2008. Special Plant Abstract for leadplant (Amorpha canescens). Michigan Natural Features Inventory, Lansing, MI. 4 pp. The compound leaves of this plant appear leaden (the reason for the common name \\"leadplant\\") due to their dense hairiness. The roots can grow up to deep and can spread up to radially. This plant can be found growing in well-drained soils of prairies, bluffs, and open woodlands.  Appearance  Typically between tall, leadplant can be identified by its small purple flowers grouped in long spikes and its grey- green leaflets that are alternate and pinnately compound. The plant produces fruits in the form of hairy legumes each with one seed inside. The flower and leafing pattern is similar to Amorpha fruticosa, however, A. canescens typically only grows to be high and prefers drier habitats whereas A. fruticosa can grow to be high and lives in wetter areas.  Uses  Leadplant is used for a variety of different purposes. indigenous peoples such as the Oglala use the plant for medicinal purposes.Species account from Native American Ethnobotany (University of Michigan - Dearborn) Retrieved 2010-03-26 Some indigenous tribes believed that the plant could aide in treating pinworms, eczema, rheumatism, neuralgia, open wounds, and cuts. The leaves of the plant were also used to make a tea and as a smoking mixture when dried, crushed and combined with buffalo fat.Gilmore MR (1919) Uses of plants by the Indians of the Missouri River Region. Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology, 33, 1-126. It is also provides many benefits to the ecosystems it is a part of, for example it provides valuable nutrition for grazing animals and helps prevent soil erosion. Leadplant may also be used in landscaping and gardening purposes due to its nitrogen fixing qualities and ability to help prevent erosion. Its nodulated roots are filled with nitrogen fixing bacteria which is needed for plants to grow.  Taxonomy  Amorpha canescens was described by Frederick Pursh in 1814. It falls under subfamily Papilionoideae of the family Fabaceae. The specific epithet \\"canescens\\" is a botanical Latin term meaning \\"becoming grey\\".NPWRC :: Leadplants (Amorpha canescens) Retrieved 2010-03-26. There have been further delineation beyond species of Amorpha canescens into distinct variants (such as the A. canescens var. glabrata) based on the amount of hairs and color of the leaves, however this further distinction is not typically accepted due to the wide variation in pubescence of the plant.  Where to find it  Amorpha canescens can be found in many locations throughout North America, ranging from southern parts of Canada to the northern edge of Mexico and spanning east from Montana to Michigan. Leadplant is typically found in dry prairie and savanna communities Leadplant prefers drier, well-drained soil of many different textures including sandy, gravely, and rocky soils. Finding leadplant indicates minimal live-stock grazing and well-kept land that is not overgrown or that has experienced regular fire.

Life Green was born December 20, 1796 in Lebanon, Connecticut to Beriah and Elizabeth Green. He graduated from Andover Seminary and on September 20, 1827 he married Theodosia Arnold (1792–1859) of East Haddam, Connecticut. They traveled to Honolulu by March 30, 1828 on the Parthian, as part of the third company from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Other members of this company were Lorrin Andrews and Gerrit P. Judd. He left his wife an exploratory took a trip to the Pacific Northwest coast of America in 1829 for the mission. The family was assigned to Lahaina, Hawaii on the island of Maui until 1831, then Hilo for one year. In 1833 they moved to Wailuku, Hawaii back on Maui, and built one of the first permanent houses there. In 1836 the Greens founded a girls' boarding school called the Wailuku Female Seminary. Their house is now the Bailey House Museum. He helped Lorrin Andrews translate the Bible into the Hawaiian language, and published the first book on the history of the Christian church in Hawaiian. He resigned from the Congregational Church in 1842 along with Andrews because he thought it should take a tougher stand against slavery. He refused to wear cotton clothing, since it was generally picked with slave labor. Bailey House Museum in Wailuku In 1843 he became an independent pastor and experimented with agriculture. He was an early member of the Royal Hawaiian Agricultural Society, founding a local chapter and published reports of his progress growing wheat and other non-tropical crops at higher elevations. In 1844 he published a biography of an early convert who was known as \\"Blind Bartimeus\\", after the biblical character, born with the Hawaiian name Puaaiki. At the suggestion of local chief Kiha, he founded the independent Pookela Church in Makawao on land donated by King Kamehameha III, conducting services in the Hawaiian language.

He took a trip back to the mainland, and then married Asenath Cargill Spring (1820–1894) from Providence, Rhode Island in 1863. Green had conducted services from about 1857 in English in his home. He founded a congregation called the \\"Pāia foreign church\\" because English was the foreign language of the Kingdom of Hawaii at the time, and the location was closer to the sugarcane plantation near the coastal town of Pāia. In April 1861 the church was commissioned by minister of the interior Prince Lot Kamehameha, who would later become King Kamehameha V. It was then called the Makawao Union Church. In 1870, Henry Perrine Baldwin his wife, Emily Alexander Baldwin, and their children joined the church. Henry served as organist for over forty years. Baldwin and his brother-in-law became wealthy co-founders of Alexander & Baldwin.

The group questioned notions of authorship and originality, implying that they often did each other's works, and that the art object was more important than its authorship.

This re-assertion of social relevance for abstraction, and even the monochrome, hadn’t been emphasized to such a degree since Malevich and Rodchenko. In the 1980s neo-geo artists, such as Peter Halley who asserted a socially relevant, critical role for geometric abstraction, cited Mosset as an influence.

It is native to much of North America, where it grows in water bodies such as ponds, lakes, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Description The plant is a perennial rhizomatous herb producing narrow, compressed, unspotted stems, up to a length of about 1 m, which are unbranched or sparingly branched. It has two types of leaf: * Submersed leaves, which are sessile and 5–25 cm long, 0.1–1 cm wide, translucent, linear in shape and ribbonlike, and red-brown to light green in colour, with a blunt to acute tip * Floating leaves, similar to the floating leaves of other Potamogeton, which are petiolate and opaque, and up to 8 centimeters long and 3 wide The inflorescence is a small spike of flowers that arises from the water on a peduncle 1.5–5 (rarely, up to 16) cm. It is a diploid species, with 2n = 26. Hybrids have been described with P. gramineus, P. nodosus (P. × subsessilis Hagstrom), P. bicupulatus (P. × aemulans Z. Kaplan, Hellq. and Fehrer), and P. perfoliatus (P. × versicolor Z. Kaplan, Hellq. and Fehrer). Potamogeton epihydrus, whole plant. Photo: Barre Hellquist. Taxonomy Potamogeton epihydrus (meaning 'on the water surface') was described by Rafinesque in 1808, one of the earlier North American species to be named. DNA analysis indicates that, despite the presence of floating leaves, P. epihydrus is closely related to P. tennesseensis, both of which are within the basal members of the large clade of fine-leaved pondweeds including P. diversifolius, P. pusillus and P. compressus. Distribution Ribbonleaf pondweed is predominantly a North American species, widespread in boreal and temperate areas. Its centres of distribution are the northeastern USA; southeastern Canada, from the Atlantic to the Great Lakes; and the Pacific seaboard from northern California to British Columbia. There are scattered populations in Alabama and Louisiana, Alaska, Wyoming, Montana and central Canada. There are two isolated populations in Britain, where it was identified as recently as 1944: in the Outer Hebrides, where it is thought to be naturally occurring; and an accidentally introduced population in the Rochdale and Calder & Hebble Canals. Ecology and conservation Ribbonleaf pondweed generally grows in shallow, standing to slow-flowing standing and running waters at up to 1900 m altitude. It tolerates acid waters as low as pH 5 and has a preference for oligotrophic, soft water conditions. Liming experiments suggest that it is sensitive to severe acidification. It is a poor disperser relative to many other aquatic plants occurring in Connecticut lakes. It is generally common and widespread in North America; however, it is listed as Endangered in Indiana and Special Concern in Tennessee. In Britain it is Nationally Rare and listed as Vulnerable. British populations lack detectable genetic variation, suggesting a strong founder effect. Cultivation P. epihydrus is not in cultivation, but would be worth attempting to grow. Its fairly small size, ribbonlike underwater leaves and scattered floating leaves could be effectively used in garden ponds, tubs or streams. Introduced populations in Britain have not proved invasive, so there is little chance of it becoming problematic. Like other pondweeds, it must be planted with the root in contact with a suitable substrate such as aquatic compost.

Following the abolition of the Patriarchate in 1700, the choir became known as the \\"Cathedral Choir\\" (соборный хор) attached to the Assumption Cathedral of the Kremlin. Following the establishment of the Holy Synod in 1710, the choir officially became known as the Moscow Synodal Choir. Soon after this boy sopranos and contraltos joined the choir to perform the new polyphonic music. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Synodal Choir was a rival in terms of skill and performance to the Tsar’s own chorus of clerical singers, the Russian Imperial Chapel Choir, which moved from Moscow to the new capital in St Petersburg in 1712. Alexander Kastalsky (Александр Дмитриевич Кастальский, 1856–1926) was the last director of the school and choir.

Early life and family David C Webb was born the fifth child and second son of Gordon and Cornelia Mary Webb at the family home, Curraghbawn, near Nenagh, in County Tipperary, Ireland on 20, November, 1928. The Webb family had a passion for adventure, and David was no exception. From the time he could toddle around, he wandered rural Ireland, rejoicing in imaginative games. As a school boy, he excelled in all sports, setting records as a bowler in cricket, as a sprinter, and as a swimmer, among other sports. David's father was a World War I fighter pilot, and his brother Patrick was a flier during World War II. All three Webb sisters, Pamela, April, and Rosemary, also served during WWII. David graduated from public school (Saint Columba's College, Dublin) just as the war was ending. Although he shared his father and brother's passions for flight, the timing was against him – so many fliers just released from the military service meant that there was no call for trainees. Partly because he was unable to take his passion for speed to the sky, David found another outlet. He became a highly competitive motorcycle racer. He was good enough at the sport to be offered a chance to “go pro”. Simultaneously, he went to work for Avery Scales, a multinational company in Dublin, where he was a rising star. Both those careers were left behind when he and a group of friends decided to build a boat, sail across the Atlantic Ocean, through the Panama Canal, and out to the South Pacific. “We wanted to see those beautiful girls in Samoa,” he recalls.From Private Interviews with Dr. David C. Webb by Moira Lynn Mefein The expedition was organized by famed sailor Tony Jacobs. The group of young men pooled their resources, bought a hull, and spent months building the boat they dubbed the Aisling – Irish Gaelic for great dreams. On May 2, 1952, David, Tony and their companions – Anthony Blythe and brothers Fionn and Christopher Darby – sailed from Galway Bay, Newspaper articles at the time made many references to the successful young businessman, David Webb, who had given it all up to sail the world. Several months and many exciting ... and frightening moments later, the Aisling and her crew arrived in Puerto Rico, where the American Coast Guard put a halt to their big plans. They never got through the Panama Canal or into the South Pacific. Coast Guard personnel hauled the Aisling out of the water and showed them that the hull was being consumed by parasites. Their rudder was very nearly torn from the boat! David stayed in Puerto Rico briefly, but was offered the chance to set up a lobster business on Antigua, and accepted. It took the Antiguan locals a while to accept that the lanky Irishman could hold his own as a lobster fisherman. They dove without any gear, often to a depth of 40 feet, to pull the lobsters off the ocean floor. As they saw he could go to the depths with them, however, they accepted him. David spent about a year on Antigua, then hitched a ride aboard a 21-foot sailboat on its way to Canada. Careers “A Calgary businessman I met in Antigua told me that if I could get to his office in Canada by a certain date, he would guarantee me a job,” David recalls. He walked in on the very date, and went to work immediately, driving “big rigs” over the icy Canadian highways. During the next several years, David enjoyed a lifetime's worth of amazing activities. He served on the earliest teams that went to the Arctic Circle to build the Distant Early Warning Line. He was there the first day they started “scraping ice” – and the night one entire section of the camp burned. Another time, he accompanied a geologist as half the team creating the first ever map of the Arctic Red River. The two spent the time in a pair of canoes lashed together, and encountered everything from raging waters to half-mad moose families and very hungry Grizzly bears and Kodiak bears. Current Dr. Webb died on October 1, 2016. Until that time he lived in Port St. Lucie, Florida, where he pressed for educational opportunities for members of under-served communities and worked towards improving the socio-economic status of individuals and families through the use of vocational and technical educational programs, micro financing and provisions for providing viable business opportunities in order to utilize the education that has been received by individuals, corporations and families. Education Returning to civilization in Calgary, David applied to, and was accepted at, McGill University in Montreal. He received his B.A. in Political Science in 1959, and his M.A. in International Relations in 1961. In 1971, he received a Ph.D from the University of Pittsburgh, where he was the first graduate of their new doctoral program in International and Development Education. His thesis topic reflected his deep interest in providing educational opportunities for people who may otherwise be under-served or completely neglected. In addition, he was able to use his passion for the space program as a link to other educational options. Philanthropic and educational advancements He served as the Director of Research and senior staff member of the J.W. McConnell Foundation, Montreal, a large philanthropic organization in Canada. Responsible for all grant evaluations at the local, regional, national and international level in the foundation's multimillion-dollar annual donations program. Grants were made to organizations globally across the whole spectrum of activity in the technological, educational, cultural, social, economic and health fields. Adequate evaluation required researching needs in each of these major areas, especially in the medical, aerospace, energy, computers, information sciences and environmental sectors. In reviewing 15-20 major requests each month, he learned much about the technical and political issues involved in these and other areas of social concern both nationally and internationally (1967-‘75). “The Foundation Board of Directors encouraged my involvement in educational, environmental, technological and social issues at all levels,” he remembers. His additional activities included representing the Arctic Institute of North America as official delegate to the First United Nations Conference on the Environment held in Stockholm, Sweden, May 2–12, 1972. Under the direction of Maurice Strong (Director-General of the Conference) worked with Barbara Ward and Margaret Meade in organizing the non-governmental agencies' important contributions to this seminal event. =Environmental research= During his time in Canada, David Webb entered into a self-directed research program into the global need for sustainable development activities at the international level and of the technological advances required to aid in this process. This search led to an understanding of the possibilities remote sensing satellites offered for the better management of the Earth's resources then demonstrated by NASA's Landsat I satellite. Studying this issue led to the decision to move to Washington, D.C. in order to become involved in the space field (1976–77). The aerospace industry Special Advisor on Technical and Economic Issues to the Royal Commission of Inquiry He was also appointed as Special Advisor on Technical and Economic Issues to the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Provision of Education, Health and Social Services in the Province of Quebec (Castonguay-Nepveu Commission). The Commission played a strong role in the emergence of Quebec as a major player in Canada's advanced science and technological capabilities. This was especially applicable in the aerospace field, as demonstrated by such global entities as Bombardier Aerospace, CAE Simulation Division, Canadian Space Agency, Radarsat Canada and others, all of which are Quebec-based. Founding Chairman and Trustee Emeritus of the International Space University Dr. David Webb was also Founding Chairman and Trustee Emeritus of the International Space University. This institution offers ten-week intensive summer courses in a different country each year to 120 highly motivated recent graduate students from around the world. In 1995 it established a permanent campus in Strasbourg, France. Since 1996, It offers a master's degree in Space Studies on campus as well as the summer program elsewhere. ISU has 25 affiliated university members around the world (1986–present). University of North Dakota Webb was recruited by Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin to serve as founding full professor and chairman of the Department of Space Studies, Center for Aerospace Sciences, University of North Dakota. There, Webb created and established the world's first interdisciplinary graduate degree program in Space Studies. He recruited an eclectic founding faculty with Dick Parker handling space medicine and biology, Joanne Gabrynowitcz for space law and policy, Jim Vedda on space commercialization, and Grady Blount anchoring planetary geology and Earth System Science. The broadly based curriculum combines scientific/technical, political/legal, social/psychological and other relevant fields of study into an integrated approach to our understanding of the issues and impacts associated with our entry into space and our attempts to live in and develop this new frontier. After Webb's departure from UND in 1990, the program was taken over by selenologist Chuck Wood, who expanded the program into the first Internet-based degree program in space studies (1993). Space Studies remains one of the largest graduate programs in North Dakota and more than 400 students have completed this program and received their M.Sc. degree. At UND, Webb and Blount created one of the first fully interdisciplinary Earth System Science programs in the United States. This incorporates, into a single field of study, the usually separate areas of atmospheric, earth and ocean sciences. This was in response to the then-speculative Earth Observing System of remote sensing satellites and integrated data systems. Blount went on to serve on the International Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems which defined many of the data formatting and calibration protocols for global environmental monitoring. The pair wrote an eight million dollar grant proposal to the U.S. Department of Agriculture which funded the construction and establishment of the Earth System Science Institute at UND (1988–89), now known as the Department of Earth System Science and Policy. Webb, Blount and Vedda hosted the first (and only) International Conference on Hypersonic Flight in the 21st CenturySmithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System (1988). Gabrynowitcz went on to found the National Land Remote Sensing Data Archive Advisory Committee and served as a pioneer in the creation of space law and policy, particularly in the area of satellite remote sensing. UNISPACE and Senior Executive Space Forum Dr. Webb served as Chairman, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) in Consultative Status with the United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, Vienna Austria, August 9–21, 1982 (UNISPACE 82). He organized a 12-day program with 120 speakers from around the world covering a broad range of topics incorporating most aspects of space exploration and development. Topics included: international satellite communications; technical issues associated with space exploration; energy from and in space from orbiting and lunar-based solar power satellites and free-flying power platforms; a global, U.N. owned and operated remote sensing satellite system that would provide both national security and environmental information to all nations. (1981–82). During the early 1990s, Dr. David Webb served as Chairman of the Senior Executive Space Forum. The Forum is held contemporaneously with the Annual Conference of the U.S. Space Foundation in Colorado Springs. It brings together senior executives from the major aerospace corporations, Members of Congress, Chiefs of Staff, and military advisers of all three armed Services, Directors and senior researchers of the major Federal Research Laboratories and senior management representatives from NASA Headquarters and Centers. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss, openly and frankly, but off-the-record, the goals, objectives, technology development issues and problem areas associated with the U.S. space program. Scientific and Engineering Council of the Universities Space Research Association He also served from 1992 through 1996 as one of six members on the Scientific and Engineering Council of the Universities Space Research Association. USRA has 84 university members and works closely with the aerospace industry to outline future technology requirements and advise the federal government of these. In addition, USRA and its associated institutions (e.g., Lunar and Planetary Institute) play a leading role in the space education field and the disposition of government and corporate funds in the aerospace-related scientific and technical fields. =National Commission on Space= In 1985, he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as a member of the National Commission on Space. The 15-member Commission was mandated by Congress to prepare a bold and visionary fifty-year space agenda for the United States. It included luminaries from many parts of the space program such as Dr. Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Chuck Yeager. Before issuing its final report, Pioneering the Space Frontier, the Commission held both public and specialized hearings throughout the nation, nine of which were hosted by Dr. David C Webb.

The boy escaped from school to his parents and Russia's Commissioner for Children Pavel Astakhov visited in Finland.Russia Today: Rantala saga: daring escape of homesick 7-year-old YLE: Russia Intervenes in Finnish-Russian Custody Case  Background  Robert Rantala is a son of the Russian mother Inga Rantala and Finnish father Veli-Pekka Rantala. The family lives in Turku, Finland. The boy was taken into child custody on 4 February 2010. Robert attended to school but escaped to his family. Russia's Commissioner for Children Pavel Astakhov met Finnish social workers in Finland on 18 March. The result of his efforts was the boy will stay with his family, but Finnish social workers will make regular visits, which solved the issue for both sides. However, in July, Inga and Robert left for Russia. In September of the same year, it was announced that they were living in St. Petersburg, where Robert continued his education. In October 2012, Robert received Russian citizenship.  Incident in the Russian media  The first news of the incident was published by Interfax on 19 February with the commentaries of Finnish Anti-Fascist Committee activist Johan Bäckman and the boy's mother Inga Rantala.Interfax: Власти Финляндии лишают россиянку и ее мужа права общаться с ребенком 19.2.2010 After that the event became one of the most debated issues in Russia and Bäckman was a central commentator of the case in Russian media.\\"Robert should forget the Russian language!\\" Finnish boy kept in shelter because he wanted to go to Russia?, Radio Svoboda, in Russian, March 11, 2010Gazeta: Finn Veli-Pekka Rantala arrived in Moscow for Russia's citizenship (in Russian: Финн Вели-Пекка Рантала приехал в Москву за российским гражданством) 12.3.2010 According to Kommersant, Bäckman was the primary source of the incident.Kommersant: Bronze Boy (in Russian: Бронзовый мальчик) 22.3.2010 The Russian media has mainly presented the incident by the parents' side.

Part of the media speculated that the reason was an anti-Russian sentiment in Finland. Some reported that the father will give up the Finnish citizenship and the family will move to Russia. According to Kommersant, Bäckman has mostly been the source of these allegations.  Incident in the Finnish media  The Finnish media has mainly focused on the reactions in Russian media. The incident was a minor news until Pavel Astakhov visited in Finland. According to the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat the incident was probably a part of the Russian internal politics, which was led from Moscow. The Russian authorities knew the real background of the case, but kept it on the news for weeks. The peak moment occurred as Astakhov, a lawyer with KGB training, arrived Turku with dozens of Russian journalists. Helsingin Sanomat: Suomalaisarvio: Huostaanottokiista oli Venäjän sisäpolitiikkaa (in Finnish) According to YLE news analysis the incident was a serious collision of cultures: \\"The Finnish authorities believed that they dealt with a child protection case, while the Kremlin's representative made a high international politics.\\" According to Finnish social authorities, it is unusual for foreign officials to intervene and that child welfare cases are carefully resolved and not decided on a whim.

The trunk is often multi-stemmed and crooked. The largest individuals are around 20 metres (60 ft) tall, with a trunk diameter of 30 cm (12 in). The trunk is mostly not cylindrical, and the fawn-coloured bark is smooth and pale, showing occasional darker chocolate-coloured patches on the trunk. The outer bark has thin, paper-like fragments, while the branchlets are smooth and brown. Leaves are opposite on the stem, simple and not toothed, 2.5 to 7.5 cm (1–3 in) long, and 1 to 3.5 cm (0.4-1.4 in) wide. Oil dots are few, but large and irregularly scattered and are visible by a lens or the naked eye. The mid rib is raised on the upper and lower surfaces of the leaf. A distinct intramarginal vein can be seen around the edge of the leaf. Small white flowers appear from November to April. The fruit is a small black berry, with three to five seeds, maturing from February to April. Regeneration from seeds or cuttings is not easily achieved.

Brief biography  Meskenas was born in February 1916 in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan in the Caucasus where his father Juozas had sought refuge during World War I. In 1921, the family returned to their native Lithuania where Vladimir's father obtained work in the Transport Department. In 1934, Vladimir left high school and enlisted in the Lithuanian Air Force, however he decided later to pursue an artistic career, and he became a freelance artist. When the Germans invaded Lithuania during World War II he and his wife were forced to work in Germany. As displaced people, Meskenas and his family migrated to Australia in 1949. After a two-year work contract at the Victoria Army Barracks, Sydney, be worked at various factory jobs. It was asserted in a 1979 issue of Lituanus, a Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences, that he \\"and all Lithuanian artists of Sydney\\" at the time were members of \\"Aitvaras\\", established in 1950. This included Jurgis Bistrickas (president), Henry Salkauskas (vice-president), Algis Simkunas, Jurgis Miksevicius, Juozas Kalgovas, Vincas Stanevicius, Petras Repsys, Viktoras Simas and Vaclovas Ratas.  Career and awards  Although Meskenas had no formal training, his pencil drawing, Mother's Sorrow, 1941 gained an award in Lithuania for the best depiction of the atrocities of the Soviet occupation of Lithuania. One of Meskenas's earliest portraits in Australia was Family Portrait, 1953, which won First Prize at the Australia-wide Art Exhibition at Mark Foy's Gallery in Sydney. Meskenas's 1961 portrait of fellow artist Weaver Hawkins was a finalist in the 1961 Archibald Prize contest,Finalists for 1961, Archibald Prize, Art Gallery of NSW and a 1963 portrait of Hawkins and his wife was entered for the 1963 Sulman Prize. This same portrait, Resting Couple, won the Helena Rubinstein portrait prize in 1963 and was described by critic Alan McCulloch as \\"the best portrait study in the competition, a careful and well integrated painting\\". In 1976 Meskenas received the Sir Charles Lloyd Jones Prize at the Royal Easter Show in Sydney for his portrait of Donald Grant. His portrait Donald Friend 1989 won the Archibald's People's Choice Award in 1989.Winner: People's Choice 1989, Archibald Prize, Art Gallery of NSW His portrait of Dr Victor Chang was a finalist in the 1991/92 Archibald, as was his 1993 portrait of Professor Fred Hollows. Meskenas painted many of his fellow-artists including Weaver Hawkins, William Dobell, Russell Drysdale, Lloyd Rees, Elwyn Lynn, John Olsen, Donald Friend, Adomas Varn and Michael Kmit. In 1993 he successfully sued for libel Edmund Capon, director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, for calling his portrait of businessman Rene Rivkin \\"... a rotten picture ... no good at all ...\\". He was a finalist for the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize in 1990 for his portrait Donald Friend, and in 1992 for David Foster O.A.M.. In 2006 Meskenas received damages for infringement of moral rights when his portrait of Victor Chang was falsely attributed to someone else in the magazine Woman's Day.  Represented  His portrait Sir Lorimer Fenton Dods (1964) is held by the Westmead Children's Hospital, Desiderius Orban (1986) by the State Library of New South Wales, and Max Schubert (1993) by Southcorp Wines.

In 1936, the mound was on the outskirts of Mersin, but after a rapid increase of population, the mound was surrounded by the Toroslar municipality of Mersin.  Discovery and excavations  Excavations during 1936-1938 period by British archaeologist John Garstang (1876–1956) who is the founder of the British Institute in Ankara, have revealed a neolithic settlement which continued up to medieval ages. However, the excavations halted during World War II and some documents in the Liverpool University have been lost after an air raid. After the war, John Garstang as well as Veli Sevin of İstanbul University and Isabella Caneva of Sapienza University of Rome continued the excavations.  Archaeology  There are 23 levels of occupation dating from ca 6300 BC. In his book, Prehistoric Mersin, Garstang lists the tools unearthed in the excavations. The earliest tools are made of either stone or ceramic. Both agriculture and animal husbandry (sheep, cattle, goats and pigs) were among the economic activities in Yumuktepe.Seton Lloyd: Ancient Turkey (Trans: Ender Verinlioğlu), Tubitak, pg 21 In the layer which corresponds to roughly 4500 BC, one of the earliest fortifications in human history exists. According to Isabella Caneva, during the chalcolithic age an early copper blast furnace was in use in Yumuktepe. Yumuktepe was probably a coastal settlement, but because of the alluvion carried by the nearby Efrenk River, the mound is now north of the Mediterranean shore.  Historical era  Yumuktepe was a part of Kizuwatna a vassal kingdom of Hittite Empire. In a document of 1440 BC, a city named Pitura was mentioned. Pitura might be the ancient name of the settlement. But a recent research suggests Elipru as the original name of the settlement. It seems, like most Hittite lands, Sea Peoples from Europe plundered Yumuktepe in 13th century BC. A second blow was from Assyrian Empire from Upper Mesopotamia. During Roman Empire, a small city named Zephyrium was established to the south of Yumuktepe. But Emperor Hadrian (reigned 117-138) renamed the city as Hadrianapolis. During the early Byzantine Empire, the nearby settlement of Soli ( at the west) flourished and Yumuktepe further lost its former status.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Ashton- under-Lyne, the archdeaconry of Rochdale and the diocese of Manchester. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It was a Commissioners' church, having received a grant towards its construction from the Church Building Commission. History Since 1776 there has been a chapel of ease dedicated to Saint George on the north bank of the River Tame overlooking its main crossing point. This replaced an earlier chapel of ease that had been damaged by a landslip in 1774. In the early part of the 19th century the fabric of the church had deteriorated and it was considered to be unsafe. In 1835 the incumbent approached Lord Stamford, the patron of the living, to provide land for a new church on a different site. Land was found for this about to the northwest. The foundation stone was laid on 3 September 1838, the same day as the foundation stone for Sharpe's St John's Church at Dukinfield, by Lord Viscount Combermere, a former Grand Master of the local Masonic Lodge. It was consecrated on 24 June 1840 by the Bishop of Chester. The new church was also dedicated to Saint George. It was a Commissioners' church designed by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe. It cost £4,012 () to build and £2,712 of this was met by a grant from the Church Building Commission. The church provided seating for 1,022 people. However the congregation of the old St George's Church did not want to leave their building for the new church, and successfully petitioned for the old church to be retained rather than demolished. It re-opened on 29 September 1843 with a new incumbent, separate from that of the new church. Nonetheless there was serious tension between the two churches, which was not resolved until the incumbent of the new church died suddenly in 1847. In 1881 the north and south galleries were removed from the church. The west gallery was not removed until 1976 when the interior of the church was divided by a brick wall. The portion to the east of the wall continued in use as a church, and the portion to the west was modified \\"for parochial, social, educational, and recreational facilities\\". Architecture The church is built in stone with a slate roof. Its plan consists of a seven- bay nave with north and south aisles under one roof, a small single-bay chancel and a west tower. The tower is in three stages with corner buttresses rising to pinnacles. The windows are thin lancet windows, containing Geometrical tracery. The east window consists of two pairs of lancet windows, each surmounted by a round window, with another round window above them. The interior of the church has been divided. The arcades are carried on octagonal piers. The alabaster font is in the form of an angel holding a shell. The stained glass is by Lightfoot. The three-manual organ was built by Renn & Wadsworth.

The entire story was compiled from these four issues of Deep Fried, had new content added, and was then released as a one-shot issue in December 2002. The story features parodies of the cast of Peanuts as well as a number of parodied objects and settings set in a post-apocalyptic world, and drawn in a darker, more adult style as a direct contrast to the more innocent style used by Charles M. Schulz. The one-shot also includes a back-up feature, A Weapon Brown Christmas which shows a story set sometime before the events of A Peanut Scorned. A sequel graphic novel, Blockhead's War, was published online on a weekly or semi-weekly basis between April 2007 and December 2012. Comprising 339 installments, the sequel again focuses on the characters of Weapon Brown and Snoopy, but moves beyond parodying the characters/setting of Schulz's Peanuts to involve them with characters and situations based upon hundreds of newspaper-published comic strips dating back to the inception of the form (the installment published October 16, 2012 featured The Yellow Kid, a character/cartoon first appearing in 1895). Characters from Calvin and Hobbes, Little Orphan Annie, Crock, Dilbert, Popeye, B.C., Beetle Bailey, The Boondocks, The Wizard of Id and Broom-Hilda are among those prominently featured. The cover to Weapon Brown, showing an image of the eponymous character A Peanut Scorned Weapon Brown is set in a post-apocalyptic world, and the story itself centers on the eponymous character Weapon Brown, who is on a mission to rescue the woman he loves from a former acquaintance: Linus Van Pelt, a man who is obsessed with a supernatural entity he calls \\"the Great Pumpkin\\". Over the course of the story's events, readers are introduced to a number of characters who are clearly recognizable as adult parodies of well-known Peanuts characters. Weapon Brown and his pet Snoopy are themselves parodies of Charlie Brown and Snoopy. The story begins with Weapon Brown having an encounter with Schroeder, while in the course of looking for Linus' sister Lucy. While he gets no information from the piano player about Lucy's whereabouts, he does learn that a woman named Patty - later revealed to be the Weapon Brown incarnation of Peppermint Patty - would know where Lucy is and directs Weapon Brown to ask her at the whorehouse she owns, which he does, greeting Patty with a slap to the face, an action she recognizes as being distinctly exclusive to Weapon Brown and greets him with a kiss. After meeting with Patty, he learns where to find Lucy, and before heading off to confront her spends the night at Patty's whorehouse, where he has a brief nightmare about how he was transformed into a one-man cyborg army. Awakening from this nightmare, and not remembering much of anything in it, he confronts Lucy, looking for information about Linus. While she has no idea where Linus is, she does know quite a bit about Weapon Brown, as she was one of the people who helped transform him into a killer. A confrontation between the two leads to Weapon Brown slaying her, but not before he drags out of her an idea of where Linus might be: the Pumpkin Patch, the area where the destructive Zinger Bombs which essentially destroyed the world first fell. After a brief battle with an anthropomorphic and excessively hungry tree — described as an 'arboreal weapon' left over from the Fourth World War — Weapon Brown finally locates his quarry and the woman he has gone so far to rescue. A brief battle ends with Weapon Brown defeated and imprisoned by Linus, thanks to a quasi-sentient life form Linus has psychic control over (which Linus refers to as his 'Security Blanket'), who is attempting to raise \\"the Great Pumpkin\\". Astonishingly, he succeeds, but Weapon Brown breaks free of his confinement and destroys Linus' blanket. Shocked at the death of his weapon, Linus then falls victim to the Pumpkin itself, which kills Linus, Weapon Brown's younger sister, and the woman Weapon Brown has come to save. The sole survivors of the encounter are Weapon Brown and Snoopy, who leave the Pumpkin Patch, their fates from that point on unknown. A Weapon Brown Christmas This short story is set sometime before the events of A Peanut Scorned and features Weapon Brown as he ventures into the wastes to find a scrawny-looking tree, whose cells are the cure to a disease contracted by scientists who work for a mysterious conglomerate referred to as the Syndicate. The tree's owner, however, mistook Weapon Brown's comments as meaning that the cyborg was after his son. He is slain in an attempt to protect his child by Weapon Brown, who was himself unaware of how his words had been misinterpreted, as he was unaware that the man he had been speaking with had a child. Said child is confronted by Weapon Brown when he enters the man's hut to retrieve the tree and upon seeing his father dead, pleads with Weapon Brown to be allowed to go with him, which Brown flatly refuses to do, stating that he already has a pet. He advises the child to stay outside and watch the light show his father had created, saying that \\"maybe Santa Claus will show up.\\" The story ends with the child, now sitting in the snow as a snowstorm has buried his dead father, singing to himself, with the implication being that he will eventually freeze to death himself. It's the Great Pumpkin, Weapon Brown In this short comic, included in the omnibus book, Linus Van Pelt and Sally Brown attempt to summon the Great Pumpkin via a sexual ritual; the horrific \\"Pumpkin Patch\\" is the locale. It's the Easter Mongrel, Weapon Brown This is a short comic featuring a young \\"Chuck\\", living by his wits; at the \\"Daisy Hill Puppy Farm\\", he battles evil giant rabbits and an immense bird called a \\"woodie\\" (a reference to Woodstock), with the help of a puppy, descended from the genetically altered war dogs bred at the \\"Farm\\", and takes him home. Shermy, Weapon Brown's friend, appears in this story. Blockhead's War This long comic series ran over a period of years on Jason Yungbluth's website, and was later collected into an omnibus volume with the other Weapon Brown stories. It follows Weapon Brown and Snoopy as they fight their way across a post- apocalyptic wasteland, and ally with Anne (a version of Little Orphan Annie), Pops (Popeye), and The Boondocks characters Hughie and Reilly against the Syndicate, and its Cyber Augmented Legionnaire Version 1.N, a villain who is an adult version of the boy from Calvin and Hobbes. Cal is accompanied by a stuffed toy which can transform into a huge cyborg tiger named HOBS. The story ends with Weapon Brown heading off to new adventures. Cast of characters The characters and settings of the world of Weapon Brown are intended as parodies of the world of Charles M. Schulz's beloved Peanuts characters. There are roughly 14 characters seen in the story who can be seen and recognized by name and look as Peanuts parodies, and one who is mentioned only briefly, making for a grand total of 15: Weapon Brown: The eponymous character from the book and star of all stories save for It's the Great Pumpkin, Weapon Brown, in which he does not appear. Weapon Brown looks like an adult version of Charlie Brown complete with his classic curled hair on his forehead. In the special material added to the story for the Weapon Brown one-shot, Weapon Brown is shown with a full head of hair, rather than the seemingly \\"bald\\" look Charlie Brown sports in the original strips and animation as a way to distinguish the character from Charlie Brown, who many people mistakenly think is bald because of the way he is depicted in various media. His resemblance to the classic Charlie Brown is explained by the explosion of a number of \\"Zinger Bombs\\" which detonated not far from where he was playing, causing him to be caught in the backwash from the blasts and which also cost him most of his hair, meaning that Weapon Brown, unlike the classic Charlie Brown, actually is mostly bald. He also wears a shirt that is a near-exact duplicate of the one worn by Charlie Brown, though much larger and heavily shredded from years of use. Weapon Brown has a cybernetic right arm which bears a radiation hazard sign at the shoulder, is powered by a \\"reactor\\", and is armed with a \\"plaz gun\\", which appears to be a weapon that fires bolts of energy. He also possesses enhanced strength, senses, and reflexes. By the time of A Peanut Scorned, much of his cybernetic arm's interior workings are visible, while it is shown as looking brand-new in A Weapon Brown Christmas. Weapon Brown's first name is revealed as being 'Charles' at various points in the story. The first point is a reference to him by the name \\"Chuck\\" by Patty, and later in a dream sequence Weapon Brown starts to refer to himself as \\"Charlie\\", only to be cut off by Lucy. Linus later reveals Weapon Brown's name as Charles. Weapon Brown is one of a number of victims of an organization called \\"the Syndicate\\", which was running a super-soldier program called Project Peanuts, which appears to have been intended to create living weapons, with at least two known success stories. Weapon Brown and Lucy both make references to Project Peanuts during the story. While the exact extent of what was done to him is unknown, Weapon Brown claims that they turned him into a one-man army and it is implied that they amputated his original right arm in order to equip him with the cybernetic one he uses from then on. At some point, Weapon Brown meets and falls in love with the character known only as The Red Haired Girl, and retires from his life as a killer, taking up as close to a simple life as can be had in the post-apocalyptic world they live in until she is abducted by Linus, which prompts him to take up his old ways in what would eventually be a failed attempt to rescue her. As with the original Charlie Brown, Weapon Brown owns a dog named Snoopy, and, like the original, this dog in no way resembles a beagle. Snoopy: Weapon Brown's pet and companion. Although he shares the name, color scheme, and breed with the classic Peanuts character, all resemblance ends there. This version of Snoopy is depicted as being a real dog, with no thought balloons or fantasies of his own (that the reader can see; Hildy, a Broom Hilda-like witch, can see them in Blockhead's War). He is somewhat more intelligent than normal dogs. He is depicted as fiercely loyal to his master. He lost the ability to see with his left eye during the events of It's the Easter Mongrel, Weapon Brown, a story published in the print version of the omnibus. He is the only other survivor of the battle against Linus and follows Weapon Brown all the way through the events of Blockhead's War. At one point when he is injured and dying, he sees himself in a World War One flying helmet and sees other dogs, presumably Snoopy's siblings; on another occasion he drives a Zamboni, and later does the Snoopy dance when the giant tiger HOBS has died. Schroeder: Nearly identical to the classic character, this version is a man in his mid-to-late 20s, plays a piano at a bar, and smokes. Like the classic version, he has no interest romantically in Lucy, though this time it is also because she is tied in with \\"the Syndicate\\", the same mysterious group which heavily altered Weapon Brown into what he eventually became and which also altered Linus. He is the first character seen in the story clearly, playing Beethoven at the bar where Weapon Brown confronts him. Peppermint Patty: Like Schroeder, Lucy, Linus, Marcie, and Sally, Peppermint Patty's name is lifted directly from the original and wears an attire meant to showcase her body, though the pattern on her outfit is instantly recognizable as being based on the striped shirt seen on the original Peppermint Patty. Like the classic Peanuts character, she has feelings for Weapon Brown which go unrequited, though it is implied by Weapon Brown that the two have had intimate encounters. Patty runs a whorehouse, and has a business relationship with Lucy. She also is a friend/employer to Marcie. According to both Weapon Brown and Patty herself, the whorehouse Patty runs was originally owned and run by a woman named Violet. Though unseen, Violet is presumably based on the Peanuts character of the same name. Franklin: Franklin serves as Patty's bouncer and bodyguard, threatening to kill Weapon Brown before she calls him off. In the world of Weapon Brown, Franklin is black as in the original Peanuts; he is apparently the only one of his kind, as Patty claims she has never heard of any others. She refers to him by the term \\"negro\\" in the comic, claiming Franklin himself has apparently referred to himself by this term in the conversation she has with Weapon Brown about him. No explanation is given to why Franklin seems to be the only one which exists in this world; however, Franklin's namesake was also the only black character in the world of Peanuts for several years' worth of strips, which may be the basis for Franklin's uniqueness in the world of Weapon Brown. Weapon Brown himself initially believes Franklin is some form of mutant, indicating he has also never seen a black person before. Much later, during the Blockhead's War story, the characters from The Boondocks, \\"Hughie\\" and \\"Reilly\\", tell Weapon Brown that a 'bleaching virus' has either killed black people or turned them white. Marcie: A whore in the employ of Patty, she is seen wearing glasses and little else save for bondage rings in her nipples and a bikini bottom in her only full appearance in the story. Patty refers to her as being \\"Kind of a weird kid\\" but seems not to mind whatever her \\"weirdness\\" is supposed to be. At Weapon Brown's request, she and Patty engage in a lesbian sex show for his entertainment. Pigpen: Seen only in a few panels, the character is portrayed as a desolate drug addict, and is first shown speaking to Lucy Van Pelt about Weapon Brown's attack on Schroeder. He is later seen offering Weapon Brown himself oral sex in exchange for drugs. In a fit of anger, Weapon Brown punches him with his cybernetic arm, apparently fatally. Lucy Van Pelt: A scientist who worked with the mysterious Syndicate, and who worked on psychologically manipulating Weapon Brown into being a compliant agent for them. The older sister to Linus, Lucy makes reference to the classic skits of Charlie Brown and Lucy wherein Lucy would goad Charlie Brown into attempting to kick a football, only to pull it away at the last moment. She attempts to utilize specialized psychological control cues (\\"whip words\\"; his is \\"blockhead\\" ) which she helped to develop in order to gain control of Weapon Brown so that she can hand him back over to the Syndicate. However, he breaks free from her when she begins singing the Peanuts song \\"Failure Face\\". She is eventually killed by Weapon Brown after being tortured for the location of her brother. Mentioned during, and with a brief cameo in, Blockhead's War, she is only referred to as Van Pelt. Woodstock: Seen only in two panels as a bird being eaten by Snoopy, this character was almost identical in appearance to the classic character, though he is not named in the brief cameo appearance. In the bonus story \\"It's the Easter Mongrel, Weapon Brown\\", enormous Gastornis-like birds called \\"woodies\\" pursue a young Chuck, leading to his first meeting with Snoopy. The Red Haired Girl: The Weapon Brown counterpart to the Little Red-Haired Girl from the Peanuts strips and animation, this character was unnamed aside from being called The Red Haired Girl (\\"Red\\", for short) and was Weapon Brown's lover. She was abducted by Linus Van Pelt with the help of Weapon Brown's sister Sally and was unseen throughout most of the story until the final chapter. She was killed when Linus' attempt to summon \\"The Great Pumpkin\\" went wrong and the creature crushed her, Linus, and Sally under it. Linus Van Pelt: Another victim of the Syndicate, Linus has a grotesquely mutated head and is in psychic control of what Weapon Brown tells the reader is a \\"quasi-sentient, polymer based\\" life form that Linus calls his \\"Security Blanket\\". The life form is kept alive and able to receive Linus' psychic commands via a small \\"primary computer plexus\\". Like the classic Peanuts character, this Linus believes in the existence of \\"the Great Pumpkin\\"; however, the Linus of this world depicted this version of the normally unseen character as something resembling Cthulhu or the Anti- Christ. In order to raise this creature from another dimension, he abducted Weapon Brown's lover and was intending to sacrifice her to the creature to permanently enable it to move about on Earth. He was distracted by the death of his \\"Blanket\\" and this appears to have caused the summoning of the creature to go wrong. He was slain by the Pumpkin as it fell onto him, Sally and the Red Haired Girl. Sally Brown: Younger sister of Weapon Brown and, like her classic Peanuts counterpart, was in love with Linus. It was for this reason that she helped Linus track down Weapon Brown and his lover and aided in the abduction that brought Weapon Brown back to his old ways. She was crushed when \\"the Great Pumpkin\\" fell apart on top of her, Linus, and the Red Haired Girl. She has an exact duplicate of the hairstyle of the original character on whom she is based. 555 95472: This minor Peanuts character, whose name was changed to a number by his father, appears as the bartender in the scene where Schroeder is playing the piano. Jason Yungbluth notes in the omnibus edition of Weapon Brown that the bartender was originally a non-Peanuts character, but upon discovering the character of 555 95472, added this number tattooed on his wrist along with a bar code. Shermy: Completely unseen in the original story, Weapon Brown makes a brief mention of him being a bounty hunter, and claims that he disappeared somewhere in \\"the Pumpkin Patch\\". In It's the Easter Mongrel, Weapon Brown, he is a friend of Weapon Brown and resembles the Peanuts character. Creatures/settings/organizations The Great Pumpkin: A parody of the unseen character whom Linus has an unshakable belief in the classic Peanuts media, this creature was a horrific-looking monster which has a number of names all referenced by the Weapon Brown Linus, including Agro Un Rama (a spoof of \\"Anung Un Rama\\", the real name of Hellboy), Pepon Grandismo (\\"Biggest Squash\\"), and Omega Vegetablus (\\"Final Vegetable\\"; the names are bastardized Latin). It is depicted as being a demonic entity similar to the Anti-Christ, and is a source of obsessed worship by Linus. It also speaks in the same row of lines normally used by Woodstock in the comic strip by Schulz. The summoning goes wrong by means unknown, and the creature seems to simply come apart, crushing Linus, Sally, and The Red Haired Girl beneath its mass. Linus was convinced the creature would destroy what was left of the world, and planned to be the creature's high priest. The Pumpkin Patch: An area of immense radioactivity, the Pumpkin Patch is stated by Weapon Brown as getting its name because \\"all the shit in the air is likely to make you resemble a pumpkin once you come out.\\" However, he also notes that as a general rule, most people never return from the Patch. As Brown describes it, \\"nothing grows in the patch except rats and tumors.\\" Weapon Brown and Snoopy are so far the only known individuals who have gone into the Patch and come back out. The Patch is also where the first \\"Zinger Bombs\\" were dropped, according to Weapon Brown via in-story monologue. The epicenter of the patch is a massive bomb crater, which sits over what appears to be an underground shelter to be used in the eventuality of nuclear attack. Weapon Brown and Snoopy use the hatch found at the middle of the crater to reach the underground hideout Linus is using in his attempt to raise \\"the Great Pumpkin\\" to destroy the world. Kite Eating Trees: A parody of the Kite-Eating Tree from the Peanuts franchise. These creatures are mobile, anthropomorphic and monstrous trees created as 'arboreal warfare devices' during the Fourth World War that often disguise themselves as real trees before attacking. Their favorite food is Canadians (who, for some reason, are referred to as \\"kites\\", a point that Weapon Brown claims he has never understood). The trees, lacking their favorite food (Canada and its people appear to have been completely wiped out by the time of A Peanut Scorned) are not picky about their food, though. They will apparently eat anything living. They also seem capable of surviving in the Pumpkin Patch; however, they lose the element of surprise within the patch because normal trees do not grow there, but Kite Eaters have green leaves, giving them the appearance of a living, healthy tree. They also possess a burning sap as a defensive mechanism. The only one seen in the comic was destroyed by Weapon Brown through the use of a shrapnel grenade thrown down its mouth. The Syndicate: A shadowy organization referenced multiple times during A Peanut Scorned, The Syndicate is a nod to the United Feature Syndicate, the company that ran Peanuts in syndication in newspapers. In the comic, however, the Syndicate was depicted as evil, and was the source of a great deal of misery for various characters, including Weapon Brown himself as well as Linus. An emergency which afflicted a number of scientists working for the Syndicate prompted the events depicted in A Weapon Brown Christmas- they had contracted a neuromuscular disease that made those afflicted seem like they are dancing. This continues until either the victims' spines snap or they die, with the implication that both usually occurred at once to all victims of the disease. The disease was referred to as 'the Jigs' and was a nod to the dancing seen in A Charlie Brown Christmas. The disease could only occur in highly clean and sanitized conditions such as a Syndicate lab. In Blockhead's War, the Syndicate is a huge corporation-nation ruled by \\"Mr. Horns\\", the Pointy-Haired Boss from Dilbert and employing the characters from comic strips such as Beetle Bailey, Crock, Mary Worth and Doonesbury. Its goal in this longer story is to capture a self-sustaining food source known as the shmoo, held by Anne (Little Orphan Annie) and her followers underneath \\"Bone City\\" (B.C.). World The world of the Weapon Brown character and the others who inhabit it with him is one that is post-apocalyptic. The world we know as the \\"modern\\" world ends, according to Weapon Brown, when \\"the Dolly Madison Corporation realizes that their artificial flavorings were a hair's breadth away from becoming lethal toxins\\" (this is a reference to Dolly Madison's snack cakes having the Peanuts characters on their labels for many years). At the same time period that this discovery is made, Hostess is not that far away from putting them out of business (and was itself liquidated and bought out by Apollo Global in the real world). According to Weapon Brown in an internal monologue, this caused them to shift from making snack cakes to making chemical weapons. They later developed the highly dangerous Zinger Bombs, which left half of the hemisphere uninhabitable. The result is that most currency in the world of Weapon Brown is not money, but technology, particularly food and, more importantly, functioning batteries (for retrieving Miss Buxley, Weapon Brown gets 100,000 calories and 50,000 volts). The Syndicate is the most prolific supplier of technology and owns a good portion of the American landmass. Books *Yungbluth, Jason. Weapon Brown (Omnibus) (Death Ray Graphics, New York) 2014.

Overview  The first school in Collie was opened in 1899, when the name of the town was still Coalville. The initial enrolment was for 55 students. The enrolment doubled the next year and a new school house was built. From 1924 the school was known as Collie District High School, and became a Senior High School in 1952. In 1900 the school had an enrolment of 110 and by 2012 had an enrolment of 486 students between Year 8 and Year 12, approximately 5% of whom were Indigenous Australians. Dale Miller is the current Principal of Collie Senior High School, after taking up this position in 2017. Enrolments at the school have been reasonably stable over the last few years with 597 students in 2007, 673 in 2008, 620 in 2009, 549 in 2010, 481 in 2011 and 486 in 2012.
