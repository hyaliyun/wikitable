Jack (31 December 1852 ‚Äì 1899), a burlesque impresario, was a pioneer of the African-American vaudeville industry in the US with his Creole Burlesque Show. He was also known for staging increasingly risqu√© shows in Chicago, where young women appeared wearing only skin-colored tights. Early years Sam T. Jack was born on 31 December 1852 in rural Pennsylvania. According to an 1895 biography, which he may have commissioned and may be unreliable, he served in the army for a short period, and then in the oil business in western Pennsylvania. In 1872 he opened the Oil City Opera in Oil City, Pennsylvania. He opened other opera houses in nearby Franklin and Titusville that specialized in melodrama. His biography says that from 1873‚Äì77 he ran a showboat, and his Alice Oates Comic Opera Company toured the US in 1880‚Äì84. There are records of Sam Jack being the principal of the Sam Jack Stock Company in Oil City. Jack's Oil Region Circuit was able to provide far better entertainment than had been offered in the past. Thus at the start of the 1877‚Äì78 season he brought in the Berger family's troupe, providing a respectable entertainment of music and sketches, Duprey and Benedicts Minstrels, the Washburn troupe and the Union Square Theatre Company. Jack was manager of Eliza Weathersby's Froliques, a variety show, which also played in the oil region. In 1878 the recently remodeled opera house reopened under his management. He had other theater interests in the area. Thus on 13 December 1879 the Meadville Evening Republican reported, \\"Mr. Sam Jack, the manager, who has given Meadville and the towns of the region so many entertainments of the highest order this season, deserves the most liberal patronage of the public ... for his enterprise and good judgment as a caterer to the best classes of theatre goers.\\" In 1879 Jack became manager of the newly renovated Pillot's Opera House in Houston. Jack began his career as a burlesque manager in 1881, when he was responsible for the number two company of Michael B. Leavitt's Rentz-Santely review. It was based in Chicago and toured the western USA. Jack added risqu√© elements from Western honky‚Äêtonk entertainments to the shows. After leaving Leavitt, Jack opened the Lilly Clay Colossal Gaiety Company, the first of his own burlesque shows. The star of the show, Lilly Clay, came from England. Leavitt says in his memoirs that he sold Jack the title \\"Lilly Clay Gaiety Company\\" for $5,000 in 1889. Jack's biography does not mention Leavitt at all, but portrays Jack as entirely self-made. The Creole Show Cover of Musical Gems, a book of songs by Sam T. Jack's Creole Burlesque Co. Sam T. Jack produced The Creole Show between 1890 and 1897. It represents a stage in the transition from the traditional minstrel shows to the vaudeville revue. It is said that Sam Lucas came up with the idea of a creole burlesque company, and persuaded Sam T. Jack to put it on. It was the first to present beautiful black women as chorus girls in place of the traditional all-male chorus. It has been called the first black burlesque show. It included original songs, sketches and comedy numbers by black artists. The show opened with three women interlocuters or conversationalists sitting in the center. They were flanked by eight lavishly costumed chorus girls on each side. There were male performers at each end and in the orchestra. The show followed the traditional three-part minstrel pattern. In the first part there was an exchange of repartee between the interlocuters and comedians, and songs and dances by individuals and the chorus. In the second part there were various sketches and variety acts. The third part was a burlesque. The show was innovative in giving women a leading role and in introducing burlesque by African Americans. The Creole Show opened in Haverhill, Massachusetts, on 4 August 1890, and traveled to Boston, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The show opened in Chicago in 1891 in Sam T. Jack's Opera House, and toured on Jack's circuit. Local girl Belle Davis was in that company. On 4 June 1892 it was announced that Sam T. Jack had stopped traveling and settled at the Madison Street Opera House in Chicago. The Creole Burlesque Company played here for most of the summer of 1893. In August 1893 it was announced that \\"Six women from Honolulu, dancing what manager Jack styles the Hullu-Hullu gavotte, are this week added to the drawing powers of his Creole Burlesquers. In the 1893‚Äì94 season the cast was joined by Charles E. Johnson and Dora Dean, a dancing team that specialized in the cakewalk, the composer, performer and stage manager Bob Cole and the dancer Stella Wiley, who later married Bob Cole. In the early 1890s Tom McIntosh and Hattie McIntosh had put together Mr. and Mrs. McIntosh in the King of Bavaria, a vaudeville act. The McIntoshes played with Sam T. Jack's Creole Show in 1894. Other artists who performed with the show included Billy McClain and his wife Cordelia McClain. John W. Isham, the advance agent for the Creole Show, decided to produce his own show in 1895, also using beautiful black women as chorus girls. At first called Isham's Creole Opera Co., the name was changed to Isham's Octoroons to avoid legal challenges. Other shows and legacy 1896 Postcard advertising the Sam T. Jack Opera House in Chicago In Manhattan in the 1890s Sam T. Jack's Tenderloin Company presented living statues of young women dressed only in flesh-colored tights, and others doing daring performances of the cancan. Preachers in New York regularly denounced his shows. Jack moved to Chicago, which was less straight-laced. He hired the bellydancer Little Egypt (Fahreda Mazar Spyropoulos) to appear at his Chicago Theatre after her appearance at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. Jack blatantly promoted increasingly explicit burlesque. However, Jack's shows still included many of the elements of a musical comedy or revue, which lent them some legitimacy. Historians often credit Jack for the form that burlesque took in Chicago by the turn of the century. Sam Jack married Emma Ward, a burlesque actress. He died in 1899, leaving an estate valued at $75,000, plus real estate holdings. His will was filed for probate on 2 June 1899. One third of the property went to his wife, Emma, and one third to his brother, James C. Jack. The rest was divided among various relatives, including his father, mother and various nephews and nieces. No provision was made for his illegitimate daughter by the actress Mabel Hazelton. The will said it was Jack's wish that his brother and widow should marry. His widow insisted that she be given the Sam T. Jack Theatre in Chicago, while his brother received the theater in New York.

Wrestling career Considering one of the world's top Greco-Roman wrestlers in his decade, Evseitchik emerged into the international scene with his blistering bronze medal effort at the 1998 World Wrestling Championships, and later represented as part of the Israeli team in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Since he emigrated to Israel at the age of 20, Evseitchik became a member of the Maccabi Eilat Club under his personal coaches Boris Tabachnik and Leonid Shulman. Evseichik did not compete internationally until 1998, when he became the bronze medalist in the 130 kg division at the World Championships in G√§vle, Sweden as part of Israel's Greco-Roman wrestling team. Two years later, Evseichik made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's super heavyweight division (130 kg). He managed to score a total of 11 technical points and a powerful set of three triumphs to defeat Czech Republic's David V√°la, Turkey's Fatih Bakir, and Poland's Marek Sitnik to earn a spot in the knockout rounds. When Evseitchik reached the semifinals, he led U.S. wrestler Rulon Gardner in the opening bout, but began to exasperate during the match and lost his fight in overtime with a default score of 3‚Äì2. Evseitchik ended his Olympic campaign with a disheartening defeat in the bronze medal match against Belarus' Dmitry Debelka, and a fourth-place finish. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Evseichik qualified for the men's 120 kg class by receiving a berth and beating Sweden's Eddy Bengtsson in the third round of the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro. Unlike his previous Games, Evseitchik suffered through a surprisingly vulnerable game plan as he was haplessly pinned by Cuba's Mija√≠n L√≥pez three times, and could not recover his form after losing out to Turkey's Yekta Yƒ±lmaz G√ºl on his second bout, finishing third in the prelim pool and nineteenth in the overall rankings without acquiring a single point.

Some volumes were also part of The Cambridge History of the British Empire. Production of the work was slowed by the First World War and the ill health of contributors, and Volume II had to be abandoned. The Cambridge Shorter History of India, edited by H. H.

Rapson noted in his Preface to Volume I that the bulk of that volume had been prepared by 1914, but the onset of the First World War had delayed completion. Rapson was an authority on the coins of ancient India, and once worked in the Department of Coins and Medals at the British Museum. The Times noted in their review of the volume that coin evidence provided some of the only sources for the earliest rulers mentioned, there being in many cases no surviving written sources.\\"Ancient India. The Cambridge History.\\", The Times, 6 May 1922, p. 16. Rapson was known for his scrupulous attention to detail and for checking not only his own references carefully, but the references of every other contributor. He also invariably agreed to help fellow scholars with their work. These factors, possibly combined with increasing age, meant that Volume II of the History, for which he was the editor, was incomplete at the time of his death in 1937.

Life Simson studied at St. Salvator's College, St. Andrews, in 1554, and in 1559 at St. Leonard's College. He was schoolmaster of Perth Grammar School between 1550 and 1560, and embraced the doctrines of the Protestant Reformation after reading The Book of the Monarchie by Sir David Lindsay. In 1562 he became minister of Dunning and Cargill in Perthshire. Simson was transferred to Dunbar on 28 June 1564. There he was also master of the grammar school, and had David Hume among his pupils. He gave up his charge at Dunbar before 11 September 1580, and was admitted to Dalkeith in Midlothian about October 1582, with the added charge of the churches of Lasswade and Glencorse. On 2 November 1584 a summons was issued, in compliance with the Uniformity Act passed by the parliament in August, requiring all ministers south of the Firth of Forth to appear before Patrick Adamson, archbishop of St Andrews, and to sign the obligation prescribed by the act, binding them to acknowledge the spiritual jurisdiction of the crown. Simson, with colleagues, refused to sign. Before 18 December he invented a milder formula of his own which he was permitted to subscribe. His stipend was taken away in 1587 and given to Newbattle Abbey, but it was restored two years later. Simson died in \\"old age\\", probably in early 1591. Works On 15 December 1575 Simson, known as a Latinist and grammarian, was appointed member of a committee to consider the best method of teaching Latin in the Scottish schools. The privy council, acting on their report, issued on 20 December 1593, directed that the grammars in use should be superseded by two books of Latin etymology, one simple and one more advanced, which had been revised by the committee. The first of these was Rudimenta Grammatices (Edinburgh, 1587), by Simson, later frequently reprinted without his name. The second was the Liber Secundus of James Carmichael. Family Simson married Violet Adamson, sister of Patrick Adamson the archbishop of St. Andrews. By her he had seven sons and three daughters. Five of his sons‚ÄîPatrick, Archibald, Alexander, Richard, and William‚Äîbecame ministers. Alexander (1570?‚Äì1639) was the author of The Destruction of Inbred Corruption, or the Christian's Warfare against the Bosom Enemy, London, 1644.

It runs schools, further education colleges and work-based training across Oxfordshire and Berkshire, and delivers higher-education and international study programmes too. Activate Learning was launched on 4 November 2013 following the reorganisation, restructure and rebranding of the Oxford & Cherwell Valley College (OCVC) Group in 2013 History =Oxford College of Further education= Founded in 1960, and based at the current Blackbird Leys and Oxford city centre campuses, the Oxford College of Further Education offered courses to students at all levels. At one time it also had a small campus on the Cowley Road, which was used for engineering studies. At the turn of the millennium the student population was made up of 1,872 full-time and 7,533 part-time students. The College was divided into three faculties: arts, engineering services, and business and technology. =North Oxfordshire College= North Oxfordshire College, in Banbury, was a general further education college that served Banbury and Bicester. At the turn of the millennium, 1,115 full-time students were based at the college. There were also 3,360 part-time students. Oxford and Cherwell College On 31 July 2003, Oxford College of Further Education and North Oxfordshire College merged to become Oxford and Cherwell College. The newly-merged college also became home to the Rycotewood Furniture Centre, which moved from Thame ‚Äì where it belonged to Rycotewood College ‚Äì to the Oxford city centre campus. =Oxford & Cherwell Valley College= A new campus was opened in Bicester in 2005. This is when the college became Oxford & Cherwell Valley College (OCVC). Reading College and the Oxford & Cherwell Valley College Group In 2010 OCVC, along with the Learning Skills Network (LSN), took responsibility for running Reading College. OCVC then became the Oxford & Cherwell Valley College Group. =Activate Learning= In 2013, the OCVC Group reorganised and restructured. The colleges in Banbury and Oxford changed their names to Banbury and Bicester College, and City of Oxford College. They now sit alongside Reading College under the new group structure. It was created in 2003 as a result of the merger between Oxford College of Further Education, North Oxfordshire College in Banbury and Rycotewood College in Thame. Rycotewood was relocated to Oxford and the college changed to its current name in 2005 due to the new opening of a new campus in Bicester. Structure Activate Learning currently operates in the following areas of post-compulsory training and education: colleges, schools, training for work and businesses, higher education, business consultancy and international study. Sally Dicketts CBE, former Principal and Chief Executive of the OCVC group, is the Group Chief Executive of Activate Learning. =Colleges= The group runs further education colleges in Banbury, Oxford and Reading. They are: Banbury and Bicester College City of Oxford College and Reading College The Banbury and Oxford colleges used to be called Oxford & Cherwell Valley College (OCVC). Their new names were launched on 4 November 2013. Each college provides a variety of education and vocational training courses, primarily for the post-16 sector ‚Äì school leavers and adults ‚Äì though they also offer training for 14- to 16-year-olds from local schools. =Schools= Activate Learning is a lead partner in the running of UTC Reading, the university technical college for 14- to 19-year-olds, which opened September 2013. It is also the lead partner for UTC Oxfordshire, in Didcot, which opened in September 2015. Also from September 2015 Activate Learning is the sponsor of The Bicester School. =Higher education= The group delivers higher education (university-level) programmes in art and design, business, care, computing, engineering, furniture, motorsports, policing and sports coaching. These programmes include HNDs, foundation degrees and honours degrees. The group also delivers the PGCE teaching and training qualification. The foundation degree and honours degree programmes are delivered in partnership with local universities, which include Oxford Brookes University and Bucks New University. =International= Activate Learning runs an international study programme for students from overseas. It is currently in discussions to open schools in Saudi Arabia and China. =Training for work and businesses= The business-to-business operations of the group are run by Activate Enterprise. It works with businesses to deliver workforce training including apprenticeships, NVQs and short professional courses. =Business consultancy= Activate Learning provides training in leadership and management to regional businesses and organisations.

KNET  The Kyrgyz Seismic Network, KNET, is the first regional continuous telemetric network of very broadband seismic data in Kyrgyzstan. This network was jointly developed by several institutions under Joint Seismic Program by Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), which were: University of California, San Diego, the Kyrgyz Institute of Seismology, and the Russian Institute of High Temperature Physics. As a part of the US-USSR Joint Seismic Program, KNET was installed in 1991 by a team of American, Russian, and Kyrgyz seismologists. The network carried on its operation under an agreement between IRIS Consortium and the Academy of Sciences of the Kyrgyz Republic after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It is located along the boundary between northern Tien Shan mountains and the Kazakh platform. Several major tectonic features are spanned by the network including a series of thrust faults in the Tien Shan, the Chu Valley, and the NW- SE trending ridges north of Bishkek. The network consists of Streckeisen STS-2 sensors with 24-bit PASSCAL data loggers. All continuous real-time data are accessible through the IRIS DMC in Seattle with over 95% data availability. The KNET system is designed to monitor regional seismic activity for magnitudes higher than 3.5 level and also provide high quality data for research projects in regional and global broadband seismology. Through its operations, KNET ensures delivery of high-performance seismic data. This data is used in research: from monitoring domestic seismic activities and estimations of a seismic hazard up to detailed analyses of deep structure of Earth‚Äôs crust and mantle. Several institutions such as, the national institutes of seismology in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, National Nuclear Centre of Kazakhstan (NNCK), the Russian Academy of Sciences, use KNET data for estimating seismic hazards. In addition, NNCK along with LAMONT laboratory (USA) carried out verification researches and monitoring of nuclear detonations in China, India and Pakistan using KNET data. = List of KNET stations = KNET consists of ten stations located near the capital of the country, Bishkek.

The network was introduced in 2008 within the frame of NORSAR, assisted by the Ministry of Foreign affairs of Norway. Along with its predecessor, KNET, the new network provides a good coverage of the country's territory, allowing major improvements in the accuracy of seismic event locations. The real time data transmission from the stations is on-line through the GPRS-Internet to the Kyrgyz National Data Center, and further to FDSN though high-speed internet.

Theagrius was a pen-name used by his father, and has been thought a macaronic form of \\"Godscroft\\". Works Hume published a Hebrew grammar in Hamburg, in 1624. On the title-page of his Pantaleonis Vaticinia Satyra, dated Rouen, 1633, Hume is called \\"Med. Doctor\\". The Satyra is a Latin romance, imitating John Barclay's Argenis. It is an \\"elegant neo-classic satire\\" influenced by Petronius; but is crude.

The lanes have a series of towers that must be destroyed, and waves of AI-controlled minions make their way down the lanes toward the enemy base. Each player controlled a hero that can use powerful abilities. Heroes gained gold as the match progressed and when enough gold was accumulated the players earned the right to acquire a new trait. To activate the new trait the hero needed only stay stationary and unharmed for a few seconds. Traits provided boost to max health, add lifesteal and have other similar effects. When the match starts each player has to choose one of the seven hero roles. The role determines the player's position on the team. The Breaker role helps in the destruction of towers while the Keeper role helps defending them. Central to the game is the twenty-minute time limit. There were three ways to win a match.

It is long and flows through Davidson Township, Sullivan County and Sugarloaf Township, Columbia County. The creek's watershed has an area of 33.5 square miles, nearly all of which is forested land. Rock formations in the watershed of West Branch Fishing Creek include the Catskill Formation, the Huntley Mountain Formation, and the Burgoon Sandstone. North Mountain, Huckleberry Mountain, and Central Mountain are all in the creek's vicinity. The temperature of the creek's waters ranges from to and its pH ranges from approximately 5.5 to just under 7.0. The creek's discharge ranges from nearly 0 cubic meters per second to approximately 25 cubic meters per second. Communities in the watershed of West Branch Fishing Creek include Central and Elk Grove. Lumbering was an industry in the watershed in the late 1800s. Fish species living in West Branch Fishing Creek include brown trout, brook trout, and sculpin. The upper reaches of the creek are designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. There is significant benthic algae coverage in the lower reaches of the creek. Course West Branch Fishing Creek West Branch Fishing Creek begins in Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 13 and southwestern Davidson Township, Sullivan County on Huckleberry Mountain. It flows northeast, almost immediately entering a valley. It soon picks up the tributaries Swanks Run and Slip Run from the left and turns southeast, its valley becoming progressively deeper. The creek continues southeast, flowing between Huckleberry Mountain and North Mountain. It picks up two more tributaries from the left and then picks up its first tributary from the right, Shingle Mill Run. Shortly afterwards, the creek turns east and begins receiving unnamed tributaries from both sides. After a few miles, Painter Run flows into the creek. The creek exits Davidson Township and Sullivan County shortly downstream. Upon leaving Sullivan County, West Branch Fishing Creek enters Sugarloaf Township, Columbia County. Immediately after entering Columbia County, the creek flows through the community of Elk Grove. It flows east-southeast for a short distance before reaching the communities of Central and Jamison City. The creek then makes a sharp turn south and flows between Central Mountain and Huckleberry Mountain and into a plain. After some distance, it turns southwest and crosses Pennsylvania Route 118. Several hundred feet downstream, it and East Branch Fishing Creek merge to form Fishing Creek. Hydrology During dry years, such as 2001, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2010, parts of West Branch Fishing Creek run dry for an average of 107 days in a year. During wet years, such as 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2009, the creek only runs dry for 5 days per year on average. In June 2010, of the stream bed were found to be completely dry. The discharge of the creek usually ranges from slightly above 0 to 5 cubic meters per second. However, it is sometimes between 5 and 10 cubic meters per second and occasionally is as high as 25 cubic meters per second. Between May 2010 and July 2011, the lowest water temperatures occurred in West Branch Fishing Creek in January and February 2011. The temperature was approximately or . The temperature was over in July 2010, with a maximum of or . The temperature was nearly in June 2010 and September 2010. From May 2010 to July 2011, the concentration of dissolved oxygen ranged from slightly over 6 milligrams per liter to nearly 17 milligrams per liter. For comparison, the minimum threshold for optimal fish habitation is 5 milligrams per liter. In the aforementioned time period, the lowest concentration occurred in May 2010. The second-lowest concentration, approximately 7 milligrams per liter, occurred in June 2010. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the creek was nearly 17 milligrams per liter in January 2011 and February 2011. The creek has the third-lowest minimum concentration of dissolved oxygen of all named streams in the upper Fishing Creek watershed, including Fishing Creek itself. West Branch Fishing Creek experiences more severe episodic acidification than any stream in the upper Fishing Creek watershed except for possibly East Branch Fishing Creek. The pH of West Branch Fishing Creek ranges from just over 5.5 to just under 7.0. The alkalinity concentration of the creek in its upper reaches has been measured to be . The concentration of dissolved aluminum in the creek is usually less than 40 milligrams per liter and is in some cases nearly 0 milligrams per liter. The maximum concentration of dissolved aluminum in the creek is 60 to 70 milligrams per liter, which is below the threshold for toxicity. The conductivity of West Branch Fishing Creek ranges from less than 20 to nearly 60 micro-siemens per centimeter. Geology Rapids on West Branch Fishing Creek Nearly all of the watershed of West Branch Fishing Creek is in the Appalachian Plateau physiographic province's Deep Valley Section. However, the lowest reaches of it, south of Pennsylvania Route 118, are in the Susquehanna Lowlands section of the ridge and valley physiographic province. The main rock formations in the area of West Branch Fishing Creek are the Catskill Formation, the Huntley Mountain Formation, and the Burgoon Sandstone. These formations are all primarily made of sandstone, but also contain conglomerate, shale, and siltstone. They were formed during the Devonian, Mississippian and Devonian, and the Mississippian, respectively. The Catskill Formation is mostly found in the lower and middle reaches of the watershed, along the creek and its tributaries. The Huntley Mountain Formation is found in the upper reaches of the watershed and on some of the streams in that part of the watershed. The Burgoon Sandstone is found in the watershed, but not on many of its streams. The soils in the watershed of West Branch Fishing Creek are acidic because of a lack of limestone. The West Branch Fishing Creek watershed, along with the rest of the upper Fishing Creek watershed, experienced glaciation during the Ice Age. There is a small moraine in the valley of Hemlock Run, a tributary of West Branch Fishing Creek. The valley of the creek is a gorge, which is one of the main features of the western part of Pennsylvania State Game Lands #13. Watershed West Branch Fishing Creek from State Route 4049 The watershed of West Branch Fishing Creek has an area of 33.5 square miles. The watershed has a drainage density of 1.3 per mile. The entire watershed is long. The vast majority of the watershed is forested, with the only urban areas being the communities of Central and Elk Grove. There are a small number of residential areas and seasonal cabins in the watershed. The watershed of West Branch Fishing Creek contains a number of sub-watersheds. The largest of these is the watershed of Elk Run, which has an area of 7.49 square miles and joins the creek from its mouth. The second- largest sub-watershed is that of Painter Run. It has an area of 5.2 square miles and joins the creek upstream of its mouth. Both of these sub-watersheds are on the northern side of West Branch Fishing Creek's main stem. History The community of Emmons was founded on West Branch Fishing Creek west of Jamison City by George R. Baum, who constructed a sawmill there. At the time, it was known as Baumstown. The mill was destroyed in a flood in 1850. The area remained uninhabited until industrial lumbering began in 1882. In September 1864, a thousand soldiers of the United States Army searched the valley of West Branch Fishing Creek as far as the Sullivan County line for an alleged fortress manned by 500 armed deserters and draft evaders. However, they were unable to find the fortress or any deserters. The community of Elk Grove is located on West Branch Fishing Creek approximately upstream of the community of Central. It was established sometime before 1915. In 1915 the community had twelve homes and a hotel known as the Elk Grove Hotel. Historically the Pentecost Lumber Company engaged in lumbering in the area of the creek and built a railroad line from the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad at Central several miles upstream, to a point at Emmons. The Pentecost Lumber Company shipped both bark and timber to Jamison City. Biology The drainage basin of West Branch Fishing Creek is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery, except for the drainage basins of the tributaries Shingle Mill Run and Elk Run, which are designated as Exceptional Value waters and Migratory Fisheries. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the creek. However, dry stream beds often prevent wild brook trout from migrating up the creek. Nevertheless, the creek has the highest population of wild brook trout of any major stream in the upper Fishing Creek watershed. In an electrofishing survey done by the Fishing Creek Sportsman Association, 17 sculpin, 11 wild brook trout, 7 escaped (and unidentified) trout, 6 hatchery brown trout, and 1 hatchery brook trout were observed on the creek. The creek is designated by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as Class A Wild Trout Waters from its source to the tributary Hemlock Run, a distance of . A location on West Branch Fishing Creek downstream of the community of Elk Grove is one of two places in the watershed of upper Fishing Creek where the stream bed is more than 60% covered by benthic algae. The high population of algae here is possibly due to leaking septic tanks in the area. In Elk Grove, there are between 100 and 200 aquatic macroinvertebrates per square meter in the creek. Further upstream, there are nearly 300 aquatic macroinvertebrates per square meter. At the headwaters of the creek, approximately 25% of the macroinvertebrate taxa belong to the order Plecoptera, about 25% belong to the order Ephemeroptera, approximately 25% belong to the order Trichoptera, about 20% belong to the order Chironomidae, and roughly 5% belong to other orders. At the creek's mouth, approximately 20% of the macroinvertebrate taxa are in the order Plecoptera, approximately 55% belong to the order Ephemeroptera, roughly 20% are in the orders Trichoptera and Chironomidae. Approximately 5% are in other orders. Woody detritus can be found on West Branch Fishing Creek. The creek's riparian buffer is unfragmented. In 2011, the habitat quality of upper Fishing Creek and its tributaries were rated on a scale of 1 to 200 (with a higher rating indicating better habitability) by Point Park University and the Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association. The headwaters of West Branch Fishing Creek had a score of 191, tying West Creek for the highest-rated site in the upper Fishing Creek watershed. Most of West Branch Fishing Creek received a rating between 166 and 200, indicating optimal habitat quality. The lower reaches of the creek, however, received a rating of 113 to 165, indicating suboptimal habitat quality. The Shannon Diversity Index of West Branch Fishing Creek is between 2.0 and 2.5 at Elk Grove. Further upstream, the Shannon Diversity Index of the creek is approximately 2.8. In the lower reaches of the creek, downstream of Painter Run, its Hilsenhoff Biotic Index is between 2.6 and 3.5. Between Shingle Mill Run and Painter Run, West Branch Fishing Creek's Hilsenhoff Biotic Index is between 1.6 and 2.5.

It has been a controversial issue for the National Rifle Association and many gun owners because of its restrictions and the unusual move that \\"legislates a product that does not exist\\". On July 16, 2019 Gov. Murphy signed into law a bill which repealed substantially all of the original Childproof Handgun Law and replaced it with a requirement that after the state Attorney General approves a production model each firearms retailer in the state would be required to carry and display at least one smart gun on their shelves with \\"a sign... disclosing the features of personalized handguns that are not offered by traditional handguns\\". History The law passed on December 23, 2002, and provides a timetable for implementation. Specifically: New Jersey State Senator Joseph A. Palaia, a member of the Republican Party from Monmouth County was a primary sponsor of the legislation Numerous parties blamed the law for causing research into smartgun technologies to stop. Inc. columnist Joseph Steinberg also criticized the naming of the law as \\"a terrible misnomer that insinuates that smartguns are somehow childproof, a notion that might encourage owners not to treat the weapons with the same care as they would conventional weapons.\\" In 2014, the introduction of the Armatix iP1, which can identify authorized users via an electronic bracelet, rekindled debate regarding the law Death threats were received in May 2014 by an owner of Engage Armaments in Maryland, who was considering selling the gun but eventually backed off. On May 2, 2014, New Jersey Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg said she would introduce a bill repealing the 2002 law if the National Rifle Association would agree not to stand in the way of smart gun technology. On May 19, 2014, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the local chapter of the Million Mom March sued the state of New Jersey, claiming none of the required quarterly reports on the status of personalized guns were filed between at least 2004 and 2012. They said in a statement: In November 2014, the Attorney General opined that the existing smart guns do not meet the requirements of the law.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 572 U.S. 663 (2014), is a United States Supreme Court copyright decision in which the Court held 6-3 that the equitable defense of laches is not available to copyright defendants in claims for damages. Background After retiring from the boxing ring, Jake LaMotta collaborated with his friend Frank Petrella to write a story about his career. That collaboration resulted in three copyrighted works: * a screenplay written in 1963 * a screenplay written in 1973 * the book Raging Bull: My Story, published in 1970. In 1976, LaMotta and Petrella assigned the copyrights in their works, including renewal rights, to Chartoff-Winkler Productions, Inc., which assigned them in 1978 to United Artists Corporation, which later became a subsidiary of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1981. As a result of its merger with United Artists, MGM obtained the rights to the film Raging Bull, which achieved popular and critical success. Petrella died in 1981, during the initial terms in the three original works. Because of the ruling in Stewart v. Abend,Stewart v. Abend, the renewal rights reverted to his heirs. In 1991, Petrella's daughter Paula sought to renew the copyrights but was able to file timely only with respect to the 1963 screenplay. In 1998, her attorney informed MGM of that status and advised that exploitation of any derivative work, including the film, infringed on that copyright. After several years of negotiations and litigation threats, Petrella commenced a copyright infringement claim against MGM in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, seeking monetary and injunctive relief but only with respect to the immediately preceding three years, as provided by . MGM moved for summary judgment, arguing that under the equitable doctrine of laches, Petrella's 18-year delay in filing suit was unreasonable and prejudicial to MGM. The District Court granted MGM's motion, holding that laches barred Petrella's complaint. The judgment was later affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, citing its previous jurisprudence in the matter. Because of conflicting opinions in the various Circuit courts on the subject, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve the matter. Decision The Ninth Circuit's ruling was reversed and remanded. In a 6-3 ruling, Justice Ginsburg declared that laches cannot be invoked as a bar to pursuing a claim for damages brought within ¬ß507(b)'s three-year window. However, in extraordinary circumstances, laches may curtail the relief equitably awarded at the very outset of litigation, Laches has a restricted scope in law for the following reasons: * Its principal application was and is to claims of an equitable cast for which the legislature has provided no fixed time limitation. In the case, ¬ß507(b)'s three-year window provides for such a limitation. In addition, the Court has cautioned against invoking laches to bar legal relief.Holmberg v. Armbrecht, * The Court has never applied laches to bar, in their entirety, claims for discrete wrongs occurring within a federally-prescribed limitations period. * While equitable tolling, which lengthens the time for commencing a civil action in appropriate circumstances, applies when there is a statute of limitations, laches originally served as a guide when no statute of limitations controlled the claim, and it cannot be described as a rule of statutory interpretation. * ¬ß507(b) allows a copyright owner to defer a suit until the value of legislation is determined. The owner will miss out on damages for periods prior to the three-year look-back, but the right to prospective injunctive relief should in most cases remain unaltered. * Although MGM pointed out the danger that evidence needed or useful to defend against liability will be lost during a copyright owner's inaction, Congress must have been aware that the passage of time and the author's death could cause a loss or dilution of evidence. Congress chose nonetheless to give the author‚Äôs family \\"a second chance to obtain fair remuneration.\\"Stewart, 495 U. S., at 220 * When a copyright owner engages in intentionally-misleading representations on his abstention from suit and the alleged infringer detrimentally relies on the copyright owner's deception, the doctrine of estoppel may bar the copyright owner‚Äôs claims completely, eliminating all potential remedies. Dissenting opinion In dissent, Justice Breyer stated that laches was available as a remedy because when Congress enacted a uniform statute of limitations for copyright claims in 1957, it did not indicate that it also sought to bar the operation of laches: \\"The Copyright Act is silent on the subject. And silence is consistent, not inconsistent, with the application of equitable doctrines.\\" Aftermath Writing for Forbes, Daniel Fisher wrote that artists and heirs will now need to be vigilant as to how their copyrights are being exploited and that film studios and other developers of derivative works will need to be diligent in examining the title to copyrighted material. MGM settled with Petrella in 2015.

His compositions have been mistaken for those of Johann Sebastian Bach. Biography Hoffman was born sometime around 1679 (or 1685 according to some sources) in B√§renstein, Saxony, Germany. His first musical service was as a choirboy in Dresden, under the tutelage of Johann Christoph Schmidt. In 1702 he moved to Leipzig to study law. Simultaneously he joined Georg Philipp Telemann at the Collegium Musicum in Leipzig and acted as the organization's copyist. Hoffmann succeeded Telemann as director of the Collegium Musicum in 1705, a position that did not end until Hoffman's death ten years later. In this position he became an educator, and his students included Gottfried Heinrich St√∂lzel. He was noted for expanding the orchestra at the Collegium to more than 40 musicians. Other responsibilities included being the organist at the Neukirche, and director of the Leipzig civic opera, for which he composed several works. He is known to have journeyed to England sometime around the years 1709-1710. In 1713 he began to suffer from the malady which would eventually prove fatal. He accepted a position as the organist at the Liebfrauenkirche at Halle in the spring of 1714, but resigned July 12 of that year having never served in that capacity. He married Margaretha Elisabeth Philipp on 9 September 1714. He succumbed to illness, in otherwise prosperous circumstances, on 6 October 1715. Style Hoffmann's compositions have been mistaken for the work of J. S. Bach. Research has indicated that an aria for alto, Schlage doch, gew√ºnschte Stunde, BWV 53, and the solo cantata for tenor, Meine Seele r√ºhmt und preist, BWV 189, are likely works by Hoffmann, and of more positive identification is a Magnificat for solo soprano and small group, which during the 19th century was assigned a BWV number of BWV Anh. 21. Joshua Rifkin has identified Hoffman's style as having \\"freshness and charm\\" while noting the \\"occasional melodic angularity\\". He has been sometimes confused with composer Johann Georg Hoffmann, although there is no relation. None of his operas survive, but contemporary reviews indicate they were well received. He has been identified as the first composer to use bells in a serious manner. References Further reading * St√∂lzel, Gottfried Heinrich. \\"Melch.

History  The walls around Kashan were built originally by Zobeyde Khatun, Harun al-Rashid's wife. She sponsored many developmental activities in the different cities of Islamic countries. Early in the Seljukid era, Malik-Shah I ordered the repair of the walls and the strengthening of two of its castles and that the Jalali castle be built in the western part of the city. According to some historical documents there was a moat around the castle in that time. The castle, tower and ramparts around the city of Kashan have protected its people very well down the centuries. For example, in 1138, Malek-Seljuk sieged Kashan for three months, but because of the strong fortification of Kashan, he could not capture the city and only destroyed some of the neighbouring villages. In 1198, Miajegh, the khwarazmid commander launched a military campaign against Kashan, but after four months ineffective siege of the city, he could only plunder the nearby villages, as Malek Seljuk had done. During these sieges the tower and ramparts were damaged severely because of stones and fire pots thrown by the mangonels of the invaders, but the destruction was repaired each time. In the early Safavid era, the castle was used by outlaws and bandits as their cover and base. Therefore, Ismail I ordered the destruction of the castle, but for unknown reasons the order was not executed, instead a few developmental measures were taken and repairs to the castle were carried out making it stronger and more impregnable. According to the historical documents, the walls of the castle were 4 m thick and 6 m high at that time.' The consequence of the impregnability of the walls was the riot of Mohammad Khan Torkaman in the Safavid era, who misused the weakness of then-government in the time of Mohammad Khodabanda and rebelled and used this strong shelter as his base. Under the cover of the castle, Mohammad Khan Torkaman was a nightmare for the defenseless people of Kashan and the villages around it for 12 years. Torkaman's wickedness even reached the Safavid house and Khayr al- Nisa Begum, the mother of Abbas I, was killed by one of the Torkaman's men in Isfahan. After that Abbas I. put on the royal crown, he immediately suppressed the rebellion and killed Torkaman and his men. After the quelling of the riot, because of peace and stability in the era of Abbas I until the late Safavid age, the inner structures of the castle were destroyed gradually and only the thick wall, towers and Yakhchals, which were built with mudbricks, remained. The gradual destruction of the castle was not the only historical misfortune of this defense structure. After the Afghans invaded, they damaged the castle severely, but in the era of Nader Shah, it was partly repaired. The earthquake of 1778 in Kashan destroyed the towers and ramparts of Jalali castle even more, but by the order of Karim Khan the castle was repaired again by the governor of Kashan, Abdolrazzagh Khan and two gates were added to the five gates of the castle. The moat, which was dug again around the castle was the most important cause of Agha Mohammad Khan's failure for capturing the city. The last battle of the castle was during the Persian Constitutional Revolution in the time of Nayeb Hossein Khan Kashi's bandits and his sons. The most important gate of the castle was the Dolat gate. It was important because of the neighboring buildings like the bazaar and a caravansary. Because of the contemporary expansion of the city, the neighboring buildings have been destroyed.

He however concluded F1 Manager was better in terms of playability than Grand Prix Manager. A reviewer for the French magazine Joystick felt the layout of the game was atheistical, which they believed would make it more endearing to the public than Grand Prix Manager, and was less complimentary on its graphical and sound bugs.

An opponent of the Romanian Communist Party, he was arrested shortly before the establishment of a communist regime and spent the next fifteen years in prison before succumbing to the treatment he received there. Biography Born in Bucharest into an upper-class family, his father Ion A. RƒÉdulescu-Pogoneanu, a university professor, was a follower of Titu Maiorescu, while his mother Elena headed the Central School for Girls prior to 1939. His brother was also a distinguished diplomat, while his sister Anina (1902‚Äì1994) was active in the Romanian √©migr√© community in Paris during the communist era.

He was assigned to the press and information office. During World War II, while a ministry employee, he took part alongside Camil Demetrescu and Grigore Niculescu-Buze»ôti in organizing secret negotiations with the Allies. Their objective was the exit of Axis Romania from the war, alongside a conspiracy against dictator Ion Antonescu that culminated in the King Michael Coup of August 1944. Cicerone Ioni»õoiu, \\"Victimele terorii comuniste. Aresta»õi, tortura»õi, √Æntemni»õa»õi, uci»ôi. Dic»õionar R\\" Moreover, as director of the ministerial cabinet and cipher unit, he played an important role both during the war and its immediate aftermath in keeping the country's decision-makers informed. He also passed along information to Western embassies in Bucharest, alerting them to the impending danger of a communist takeover, and sent documents abroad that demonstrated the economic domination and despoilment being practiced by the country's Soviet occupiers. He was dismissed from the ministry in 1946. A member of the National Peasants' Party, he had helped its leader Iuliu Maniu develop ties with foreign diplomats during the war. RƒÉdulescu-Pogoneanu was arrested in August 1947 following the TƒÉmƒÉdƒÉu Affair that led to the persecution of numerous individuals within the party. Sentenced that November together with Maniu and four others, he received 25 years' imprisonment for conspiracy and treason, with an additional 55 years for three other charges. One account relates that, charged with abetting \\"foreign traitors\\", he replied that he was only prevented from doing so lest his ill health impede their activities. He passed through the prisons at Malmaison, Gala»õi, Sighet, R√¢mnicu SƒÉrat and VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti. He spent nearly four years at Gala»õi, after which he was transferred to Sighet. While at Sighet Prison, where he was mainly kept isolated from other prisoners, a medical examination found he was suffering from a variety of physical ailments, including spastic paraplegia, hypoesthesia and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. By the time he reached R√¢mnicu SƒÉrat Prison following the closure of Sighet in 1955, he was confined to a bed in his cell. In 1956, he asked for a medical examination, and the prison authorities recorded a \\"hostile attitude\\" on his part toward the leadership and staff due to complaints about his treatment. Unable to leave his bed when ordered, he was, as a result, beaten by prison warden Alexandru Vi»ôinescu and his guards. In the autumn of 1961, by which time it was too late to save his life, he was transferred to the VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti prison hospital and died there the following March. According to Neagu Djuvara, the pro-communist sociologist Mihai Ralea had suggested to RƒÉdulescu-Pogoneanu to be \\"more flexible\\" with the prison administration.

With Bajirao, she had four children, including Balaji Baji Rao and Ragunath Rao. Balaji succeeded Bajirao as Peshwa upon the latter's death in 1740. Also following Bajirao's death, Kashibai fostered her step-son, Shamsher Bahadur, whose mother was Bajirao's second wife, Mastani. Family Kashibai was the daughter of Mahadji Krishna Joshi and Shiubai of Chas, belonging to a wealthy banker family. She was fondly called \\"Laadubai\\" and was born and raised in Chaaskaman village, which is located 70 kilometer away from Pune. Kashibai‚Äôs father, Mahadji Krishna Joshi, was originally from Talsure village in Ratnagiri and later shifted to Chaaskaman. Mahadji was a wealthy sahukar (moneylender) as well as the subedar of the Maratha empire in Kalyan, a factor which played a strong role in the alliance of Bajirao and Kashibai. Mahadji had also helped the reigning Maratha emperor (Chhatrapati) Shahu in his difficulties and as a reward was appointed as his treasurer. Kashibai also had a brother named Krishnarao Chaskar. According to historian Pandurang Balkawade, Kashibai was quiet and soft-spoken and suffered from a type of arthritis. Marriage Kashibai was married to Bajirao I on March 11, 1720 in a household ceremony at Saswad. The marriage was a happy one and Bajirao was essentially monogamous by nature and the family tradition. He always treated his wife with love and respect. Kashibai and Bajirao had four sons together. Balaji Baji Rao (nicknamed \\"Nanasaheb\\"), was born in 1721 and was later appointed Peshwa by Shahu in 1740 after Bajirao's death. Their second son Ramchandra died young. Their third son Raghunath Rao (nicknamed \\"Ragoba\\") served as the Peshwa during 1773‚Äì1774 while their fourth son Janardhan Rao also died young. Since mostly male members of the Peshwa family were out on the battlefield, Kashibai controlled the day-to- day running of the empire, especially of Pune. And it was possible because of her social nature. Bajirao took a second wife, Mastani, the daughter of Hindu king Chhatrasal of Bundelkhand from his Muslim wife. However, this marriage was not accepted by the Bhat family. Kashibai is also noted to have not played any role in the household war waged by the Peshwa family against Mastani. Historian Pandurang Balkawade notes that various historical documents suggest that she was ready to accept Mastani as Bajirao's second wife, but could not do so going against her mother-in-law Radhabai and brother-in-law Chimaji Appa As the Brahmins of Pune boycotted the Peshwa family due to Bajirao's relations with Mastani, Chimaji Appa and Nanasaheb resolved to force the separation of Bajirao and Mastani in early 1740. Bajirao's death While Bajirao was out of Pune on expedition, Mastani was put under house arrest. Nanasaheb had sent his mother Kashibai to meet Bajirao. Kashibai is said to have served him on his deathbed as a loyal and dutiful wife and has been described as highly devoted to her husband. She and her son Janardhan performed the last rites. Mastani died soon in 1740 after Bajirao's death and then Kashibai took care of their son Shamsher Bahadur and made facilities to train him in weaponry. She became more religious after her husband's death. She performed various pilgrimages and stayed in Banaras for four years. On one such tour she was accompanied with 10,000 pilgrims and had expenditure of rupees one lakh. Returning from a pilgrimage in July 1747, she commissioned a temple dedicated to Shiva in her hometown Chas naming it Someshwar Temple. Built in 1749, the temple stands on a land and is popular for Tripurari Poornima celebrations and finds mention in the Marathi book Sahali Ek Divasyachya Parisaraat Punyachya as a tourist spot near Pune.

Limnos was constructed in Vlissingen, Netherlands, along with her sister ship . The contract for her construction was signed in Athens in July 1981 and her commissioning took place on 18 September 1982. After commissioning, Limnos joined the Hellenic Fleet on 5 November 1982 and since then she has actively participated in its activities. Service history Limnos took part in several operations including Operation Desert Storm and Operation Desert Shield in 1990 and 1991.

This came after unconfirmed reports that Limnos collided with the frigate , one of the ships of the Turkish Navy that were escorting Oru√ß Reis, which resumed drilling operations southeast of the Greek island of Kastellorizo on 10 August, after suspending its work in July. On the following day, the Hellenic Ministry of National Defence released a date stamped photograph of Limnos conducting joint drills with four other Greek frigates and two units of the French Navy in that same area. According to unnamed \\"Greek defense sources\\", the Greek frigate manoeuvred to avoid a head-on collision, after Kemalreis attempted to \\"block\\" Limnos path and in the process its bow touched the rear of the Turkish frigate. Initially, the Turkish frigate's fate remained unconfirmed, despite reports that mentioned it was deemed unoperational due to propeller damage, requiring return to port for repairs. Later on the same day and in response however, the Turkish Ministry of Defense released a video of the ship in social media, declaring that Kemalreis was also fully operational and its condition was unchanged, normally continuing its original mission. As a response to the Turkish President's statements, the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement, announcing that the Greek Foreign Minister would brief in detail his European counterparts on the operational and technical details of that incident.

It began in 1998 and is still ongoing. Among a sample size of 14 million Indians, approximately 1 million deaths are assigned medical causes through the Verbal Autopsy method to determine disease patterns and direct public health policy. The principal investigator of the study is Dr. Prabhat Jha, director of the Centre for Global Health Research and professor of epidemiology at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Canada. Context In India, like many low and middle income countries, the vast majority of deaths occur at home without medical attention (over 75%), rather than with the standard of hospital care and supervision common in high income countries prior to death. As a result, estimates suggest a majority of the approximately 60 million global annual deaths, and specifically over half of Indian at-home deaths, are undocumented and do not have a medically certified cause of death. Deaths occurring in hospitals may be documented with official death certificates issued by medical professionals. The MDS was conceived to study previously undocumented at-home deaths to gain a more statistically representative understanding of disease patterns in India. Methodology Between the study period of 1998-2014, the MDS investigators collaborated with the Registrar General of India to monitor approximately 14 million people in 2.4 million nationally representative Indian households, to produce underlying medical causes of deaths for about 1 million deaths. This made the MDS one of the largest studies of premature mortality in the world. The MDS used India‚Äôs existing Sample Registration System (SRS), a government program operated by the Registrar General of India since 1971, as a sampling framework for data harvest by trained surveyors. The collaborators of the MDS successfully arranged to expand the overall size of the SRS at the inception of the study in 1998. Surveyors visited households in the sample units of the SRS every 6 months to inquire about deaths in the family. When a death was noted, an in-person interview of an extant, close family member was administered using the Verbal Autopsy method to determine the deceased‚Äôs health status prior to death and record a narrative of the events leading to death. This written information was then used by trained physicians to assign a probable cause of death using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). The information for each death was provided to two physicians to ensure greater accuracy, with a senior physician adjudicating the assignment of a cause of death in the event of an initial disagreement. Logistical management and low costs made the MDS a success. The study was able to maintain a cost of less than US$1 per household surveyed by using the existing SRS framework and collaborating with India‚Äôs census department and the overall operational cost of the study was about US$2 million per year. The study had two main phases: the first, from 1998-2003, gathered information on 300 000 deaths within the sample, and the second phase, from 2004-2014, gathered information on the remaining 700 000 deaths for the target of about 1 million. The large amount of data and wide range of causes of death from the MDS necessitated forming working groups of internal and external scientists to review and interpret results. The MDS working groups, which reflect the broad categories of global mortality, are as follows: *Maternal and Child Health: Rajesh Kumar (chair), Shally Awasthi, Robert E.

Jotkar, Ramanan Laxminaryan, SK Mishra, Richard Peto *Suicide: Vikram Patel (chair), Vendhan Gajalakshmi, G Gururaj, Prabhat Jha, Chinthanie Ramasundarahettige, K Srinivasan, Lakshmi Vijayakumar Key Results of the MDS The World Health Organization‚Äôs estimates of disease rates in India are largely based on medically certified causes of death from hospital records, while results from the Million Death Study offered statistical representation of rural, undocumented deaths. The following are results of the Million Death Study from a variety of scientific publications with several comparisons of disease deaths estimated from hospital record data. Annual Indian deaths based on the Million Death Study results: *2.3M deaths of children under age 5 (2005 figure, since reduced) *1M tobacco related deaths *556K cancer deaths (2010 figure) *100K alcohol related deaths *200K malaria deaths (WHO estimate was 15K) *100K HIV/AIDS deaths (UNAIDS estimate was 400K) *50K snakebite deaths (WHO worldwide estimate was 50K) *30K cervical cancer deaths *183K road traffic deaths The various results of the MDS, combined with geospatial analysis, show that each disease has largely varying prevalence rates throughout India, indicated that regional factors affect prevalence and that these sources of premature mortality are largely avoidable. One example is the wide variation between the estimated Indian national annual average rate of 30 000 cervical cancer deaths compared with only 6000 annual cervical cancer deaths at the reported rates of Jammu and Kashmir state and Assam state. Criticism of the MDS Several notable criticisms of the MDS have been discussed in published scientific literature. The study‚Äôs use of the expanded Indian Sample Registration System for data harvest allows for a large sampling framework, but despite the 7 597 sampling units and reported 2.4 million households the framework still only covers a fraction of India‚Äôs more than 1 billion people and more than 9.5 million annual deaths. The main focus of the MDS is adult mortality and the sampling framework captures a limited number of maternal deaths. This indicates the study may not have sufficient statistical power to thoroughly analyze maternal mortality and its connection with newborn mortality. A wider selection of maternal and newborn health indicators on the surveyor questionnaires during data harvest would have allowed more detailed study of these sources of premature mortality. The verbal autopsy method operates with the assumption that most causes of death can be recognized by trained physicians based on descriptions of signs and symptoms provided by an extant close relation of the deceased. Identification is simple for causes of death with distinct symptoms such as tetanus but can be difficult to distinguish in cases which have symptoms common to many diseases, such as of the fever during malaria infection. Verbal autopsy has also been described as ineffective in identifying causes of death in persons over 70 years of age. An ongoing debate in the field of mortality estimates is the efficiency and validity of boot-strap measurement models such as the MDS compared with modern advances in the computer modeling of disease patterns. Legacy of the MDS Published findings from analyses of MDS data have guided several of the Indian Government‚Äôs public health policy decisions in the 2000s and early 2010s. The MDS model of data harvesting using low cost field surveying and the verbal autopsy method have also prompted interest in replicating the study in several other low and middle income countries.

He was known for his scrupulous attention to detail and for checking not only his own references carefully, but the references of every other contributor. He also invariably agreed to help fellow scholars with their work. These factors, possibly combined with increasing age, meant that Volume II of the History, for which he was the editor, was incomplete at the time of his death in 1937. He had confided to colleagues that the slow pace of the work meant that large parts of it needed to be updated to include the latest scholarship. For all these reasons, and possibly the upcoming war too, it remained unpublished. Other scholarly work Rapson also deciphered and then edited various documents that his friend the archaeologist Aurel Stein had discovered in his 1900 expedition to Chinese Turkestan.

DragonFly underwent testing in Texas at the McGregor Rocket Test Facility in October 2015. However, the development eventually ceased as the verification burden imposed by NASA was too great to justify it.  Design  The DragonFly test vehicle is powered by eight SuperDraco hypergolic rocket engines, arranged in a redundant pattern to support fault-tolerance in the propulsion system design. SuperDracos use a storable propellant combination of monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer (NTO), the same propellants used in the much smaller Draco thrusters designed for attitude control and maneuvering on the first-generation Dragon spacecraft. While SuperDraco engines are capable of of thrust, during use on DragonFly flight test vehicle, each will be throttled to less than to maintain vehicle stability.  History  In May 2014, SpaceX publicly announced an extensive test program for a propulsively-landed space capsule called DragonFly. The tests were to be run in Texas at the McGregor Rocket Test Facility in 2014‚Äì2015. A flight test program of up to 60 flights was proposed. An outline for thirty of those flights included two propulsive assist (parachutes plus thrusters) and two propulsive landing (no parachutes) landing-only test flights, where DragonFly would be dropped from a helicopter at an altitude of approximately . The other 26 test flights were projected to be vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) test flights that will take off from a purpose-built pad: eight were to be propulsive assist hops (landing with parachutes plus thrusters) and 18 were to be full propulsive hops, where the landing is made with only rocket propulsion, similar to the Grasshopper and F9R Dev booster stage test flights that SpaceX also flew out of their McGregor facility. Test flights were planned to include a subset of tests that would test both the DragonFly space capsule and the attached trunk, an unpressurized structure that typically carries mission-specific cargo and houses the power supply system for Dragon orbital flights. The others were planned to be test landings of only the capsule itself, without the trunk. A Final Environmental Assessment was issued by the FAA in August 2014. The FAA determined that the DragonFly test program \\"would not significantly impact the quality of the human environment.\\" The assessment estimated that the program would take two years for SpaceX to complete and considered a total of 30 annual operations of the DragonFly test vehicle in each year of operation. SpaceX received a renewal permit from the FAA on July 29, 2016, to continue another year of flight testing.Final Dragonfly Experimental Permit and Orders EP 15-011A Rev2 FAA, July 29, 2016 The DragonFly test vehicle‚Äîformerly the Dragon2 test article that was used in the May 2015 pad abort test‚Äîwas at McGregor for the start of the two-year test program by October 2015.

Francis Hardy, 1811 engraving Life Hardy graduated B.A. at Trinity College, Dublin in 1771, and was called to the bar in 1777. In politics he was an associate of Henry Grattan. In 1783, through the interest of the Earl of Granard, Hardy was returned as member for Mullingar in the Parliament of Ireland. Hardy sat as representative for Mullingar from his first entrance into parliament until the Union with Great Britain in 1800/01. He was an effective speaker, but only took part in major debates. Although he was short of money Hardy declined governmental overtures, by which it sought to induce him to vote for the legislative union with Great Britain. After the Union, Hardy retired to the country, and passed much of his time with Grattan and his family. He was appointed a commissioner of appeals at Dublin in 1806. He died on 26 July 1812, and was interred at Kilcommon, County Wicklow. Works Hardy co-operated with Lord Charlemont in the establishment of the Royal Irish Academy at Dublin in 1786, and in 1788 contributed to its publications a dissertation on some passages in the Agamemnon of √Üschylus. The publication of some of the writings of Charlemont, who had died in 1799, was planned by Hardy; and he then undertook a biography at the suggestion of Richard Lovell Edgeworth. He received assistance from the Charlemont family, Grattan and others. It appeared at London in 1810, Memoirs of the Political and Private Life of James Caulfield, Earl of Charlemont, Knight of St. Patrick. The memoirs are not completely accurate.

An early supporter of Democratic Grover Cleveland, he was appointed Minister to Liberia in Cleveland's first presidential term. During Cleveland's second term, Taylor was the first African American ever nominated for a diplomatic appointment to a \\"white\\" country (Bolivia), although he was not confirmed by the Senate. He was subsequently made Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia, a position he held until early in the McKinley administration. After leaving Washington, Taylor edited an Atlanta newspaper, The Southern Appeal, as well as being dean of the Law Department at Morris Brown College.  Early life  Taylor was born in slavery on a plantation near Marion, Alabama, possibly in 1856, although sources differ on the year of his birth, as about many details of his life. After the Civil War he went with his family to Savannah, where he was educated at Beach Institute, a school of the American Missionary Association. He may have attended Oberlin College, in Ohio, and have studied law at the University of Michigan. He claimed to have graduated from the latter institution, although there is no record of his having done so. He was admitted to the bar in Marion County, Indiana, in 1882, and served as a deputy district attorney in Indiana‚Äôs Nineteenth Judicial District. In 1883, while teaching school in Palmyra, Missouri, Taylor met and married Julia Shropshire, and in the following year moved to Kansas, where he began his career as an orator and political organizer.  First Cleveland administration  Although Taylor, like most African Americans at the time, initially supported Republican candidates and campaigned for Kansas Republican gubernatorial candidate John Martin in 1884, he was disappointed at the lack of patronage positions Republicans offered blacks. In 1884 he began publishing a newspaper, ‚Äúin the interests of democracy,‚Äù and in 1886 ran for local office in Wyandotte County as an independent. In 1887, Cleveland appointed Taylor U.S. Minister to Liberia. He stayed in Liberia only five months, claiming he had returned to campaign for Cleveland‚Äôs re-election, although he later made statements strongly critical of Liberian politics, and of the emigration schemes of the American Colonization Society. In the run-up to the 1888 presidential election, Taylor participated in founding the National Negro Democratic League at a meeting in Saint Louis, together with Herbert A. Clark and J. Milton Turner. The primary purpose of the League, according to Bruce Mouser, was to prepare lists of African American candidates for ‚Äúhigh level patronage positions‚Äù in the event of a Democratic administration. In the same year, Taylor gave speeches at the Kansas and Missouri state Democratic conventions and was elected as an alternate in the Kansas delegation to the national Democratic convention in St. Louis, ‚Äúthe first and only Negro ever sent to a Democratic National convention,‚Äù according to one contemporary account. Taylor campaigned for Cleveland‚Äôs re-election in several swing states, including Iowa, Indiana, Missouri and New York.  Cleveland interregnum  After Cleveland‚Äôs defeat, Taylor settled in Atlanta, where he built up a large legal practice; a contemporary newspaper account described him as the first black lawyer in the history of Atlanta to appear in city court as an attorney.Charlotte (NC) News, January 12, 1889, p. 2. https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1031515/18890112charlottenewsncp2untitled/ In 1889, he published a lengthy pamphlet, Whites and Blacks, or The Question Settled, which criticized the loyalty of African Americans to the Republican party and argued that blacks in the South would only achieve civil liberty by cultivating better relations with white southerners: ‚ÄúThe Southern white men,‚Äù Taylor wrote,‚Äù will give the Negro all he merits.‚Äù In the following year, however, Taylor returned to Kansas, perhaps due to the deteriorating racial climate in Georgia as well as the changing political scene in Kansas with the rise of the Populist Party. He became editor of a black newspaper in Kansas City, Kansas, The American Citizen, and ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Kansas legislature on the ‚Äúfusion‚Äù Democratic-Populist ticket in the 1890 election. As the 1892 presidential election approached, Taylor spoke frequently in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and neighboring states against prohibition, the so-called ‚ÄúMcKinley tariff,‚Äù and in support of Democratic candidates. He became head of the National Negro Democratic League in 1892, giving him considerable national influence over the awarding of patronage positions to African Americans following the Cleveland victory.  Second Cleveland administration  Cleveland nominated Taylor as Minister to Bolivia in September, 1893. After almost five months of delay, the Senate refused to confirm the nomination, claiming the Bolivians would not accept a black representative. Cleveland then nominated Taylor to be Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia, also a highly controversial nomination since District Democrats wished one of their own to have the position. Taylor‚Äôs nomination was ultimately confirmed by the Senate, owing partly to the intervention of the venerable Frederick Douglass, who had previously been Recorder.Wichita Daily Eagle, August 24, 1894, p1. https://www.newspapers.com/image/85662530/} Throughout his tenure as Recorder, Taylor continued to face intense criticism. The Civil Service Commission, among whose members was Theodore Roosevelt, found him guilty of unfair campaign levies on African American civil servants and recommended his dismissal to President Cleveland. He was also accused by the editor of the Washington Bee, Calvin Chase, of immoral relationships with women. Taylor successfully sued Chase for libel, resulting in a jail term for Chase. Cleveland did not act on the Commission's recommendation, and Taylor continued as Recorder of Deeds through the rest of the Democratic administration.  Post-Cleveland life  Following the Democratic defeat in 1896, Taylor practiced law for a time in Baltimore before becoming dean of the Law department at Morris Brown College in Atlanta. He continued to practice law, give speeches, and edit a newspaper, the Southern Appeal, until his health went into decline. He died in May, 1899, and was interred in Baltimore. Taylor‚Äôs personal relationship with Grover Cleveland became the subject of controversy in 1904 when a Republican congressman from Kansas, attempting to counter Democratic criticisms of Theodore Roosevelt for dining with Booker T. Washington, claimed that Cleveland had dined with Taylor. Weeks of claims and counter-claims followed, including a letter from Cleveland himself denying he had ever lunched with Taylor. There was suspicion that Cleveland was thinking of running for a third presidential term and wanted to curry favor with white southerners, for many of whom \\"social equality\\" between blacks and whites was a taboo. As late as 1936, a white Democratic politician from Kansas City, Joseph B. Shannon, on the occasion of the dedication of a series of portraits of District of Columbia Recorders of Deeds, praised Taylor for his ‚Äúcourage and convictions‚Äù: ‚ÄúIt took courage for a colored man to take the stand that Taylor took at that time,‚Äù Shannon said. ‚ÄúAnd I want to say here that he had that courage, coupled with an intelligence and independence of thought that in my opinion links his name with such men of his race as Booker Washington, Paul Dunbar, Paul Robeson, Countee Cullen and others whose names have brought honor to the Negro race of the country.‚Äù  References  *\\"Admitted to Bail.\\" Washington Evening Star, March 8, 1895, p. 12\\\\. *Charlotte (NC) News, January 12, 1889, p. 2\\\\. *‚ÄúDeath of C.H.J.

History Based in Calgary, Alberta, the organization was founded in 2010 by John Carpay, a former Alberta provincial director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and a former candidate of the federal Reform Party and provincial Wildrose PartyHistory of Federal Ridings Since 1867, accessed 22 May 2014, http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/FederalRidingsHistory/hfer.asp?Include=&Language;=E&rid;=877&Search;=DetCandidates by Party, accessed 22 May 2014, http://results.elections.ab.ca/wtPartyCandidatesWAP.htm? who later joined the United Conservative Party.  Major court cases  The Justice Centre has argued cases in every province in Canada except Quebec, before the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba, and Ontario Superior Court of Justice. = Allen v Alberta = Allen v Alberta was a legal challenge to the Government of Alberta's monopoly on health insurance within the province (as it applies to seeking out-of-province treatment) by Darcy Allen, who had elected to pay $77,000 to undergo surgery for his chronic back pain in Montana rather than wait for treatment in Alberta. The case closely mirrored the 2005 case of Chaoulli v Quebec (AG) where the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that a government monopoly on health insurance, when combined with extremely long wait lists before care could be provided, was a violation of the individual's right to life, liberty, and security of the person, all of which are guaranteed under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court of Queen's Bench ruled against Allen on 31 March 2014. = Wilson v University of Calgary = A campus anti-abortion club caused controversy at the University of Calgary when they erected a graphic display as part of a \\"Genocide Awareness Project,\\" which illustrated results of an abortion along with historical atrocities such as the Holocaust and the Rwandan genocide. This case was the ninth time in which the group had put on the display. University security staff requested that the students turn the graphic portions of their display inward, away from passers-by. When the eight students running the display refused to comply, the university initiated non- academic misconduct proceedings against them. The school's Vice-Provost ruled that the actions constituted misconduct and penalized the students with a formal written warning. This penalty was appealed to the University of Calgary's Board of Governors, which refused to hear the appeal and upheld the penalty. The students then requested that the Court of Queen's Bench order the Board of Governors to allow an appeal. The court ruled in April 2014 that the Board of Governors' decision not to hear the appeal of the students \\"[lacked] justification, transparency and intelligibility\\" and ordered the board to hear the students' appeal. = 2019 license plate challenges = In 2019, the Justice Centre represented three individuals in cases related to license plates that were revoked due to complaints -- two in Manitoba, one in Nova Scotia. John Carpay stated that without such action, \\"we move closer to a society where people have a legal right not to feel offended which means that there‚Äôs less freedom of expression.\\" The Canadian Civil Liberties Association expressed support for the plaintiffs in these cases. The Manitoba plates were \\"ASIMIL8\\", issued to a Star Trek fan, and \\"NDN CAR\\", issued to a First Nations man in reference to the song NDN Kar by Keith Secola. In October 2019, the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba upheld the decision of Manitoba Public Insurance to take back the \\"ASIMIL8\\" because of the association of that word with the forced assimilation of Indigenous people. An agreement was reached between the owner and Manitoba Public Insurance to return the \\"NDN CAR\\" plate to its owner. The Nova Scotia plate was \\"GRABHER\\", which caused controversy as the surname of the car's driver, Lorne Grabher, is similar to the phrase \\"grab her\\". A decision of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court upheld the province's decision to revoke the plate. =Yaniv v. Various Waxing Salons= In 2019, the Justice Centre represented five estheticians in Yaniv v. Various Waxing Salons before the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal. The complainant, Jessica Yaniv, a trans woman, filed discrimination complaints against 13 waxing salons alleging that they refused to provide Brazilian waxes to her because she is transgender. In response to the complaints, several of the estheticians said that they lacked the required training to wax male genitalia, or that they were not comfortable doing so for religious or personal reasons. The Tribunal ruled against Yaniv and ordered her to pay $6,000 in restitution split equally among three of the service providers. The ruling was critical of Yaniv, stating that she ‚Äútargeted small businesses, manufactured the conditions for a human rights complaint, and then leveraged that complaint to pursue a financial settlement from parties who were unsophisticated and unlikely to mount a proper defence‚Äù, and admonished her for using human rights law as a \\"weapon\\" to \\"penalize\\" marginalized women with a racial animus and for filing in such a volume for financial gain. On January 7, 2020, the Justice Centre announced it was representing another salon in an additional complaint filed by Yaniv in early October 2019.https://www.sprucegroveexaminer.com/news/canada/rights-centre-says-trans- activist-jessica-yaniv-has-filed-new-suit-against-b-c-salon-over-waxing- refusal/wcm/65c2d00f-f916-42ef-bd85-b8e37b311d48  Intervenor status  The Justice Centre has acted as an intervenor in several court cases involving questions of constitutional rights; evangelical Christians, anti-abortion groups, or other groups that have felt their religious values have been compromised as well as intervening in cases concerning the protection of freedom of speech; protecting the rights of gun owners; and advocating for parents who want to prevent their children from seeking reassignment surgery or hormone treatment to relieve gender dysphoria. By acting as an intervenor, the Justice Centre is able to have their position on the legal questions brought before the court without actually being the official legal counsel for the individuals and organizations on whose behalf the Justice Centre was intervening. = Trinity Western University = In 2012 the private evangelical school Trinity Western University (TWU) completed a proposal to establish its own law school. Several groups objected to the establishment of this law school because of TWU's Community Covenant Agreement, a code of conduct, which is mandatory for all students to agree to. Unlike codes of conduct at many universities throughout Canada, however, TWU's Community Covenant Agreement requires explicit acceptance of an evangelical ethical framework including bans on gossip, vulgar language, pornography, and sexual conduct \\"that violates the sacredness of marriage between a man and a woman\\". As a result of opposition to the Community Covenant Agreement the memberships of the Law Society of Upper Canada (now the Law Society of Ontario), the Law Society of British Columbia, and the Nova Scotia Barristers' Society voted to not accredit the law school. This prevented graduates from being automatically admitted to practice law in those three provinces, though they were still able to apply for individual admission to the society after graduation. The Justice Centre acted as an intervenor in the cases of Trinity Western University v Nova Scotia Barristers' Society (court ruled in favour of TWU), Trinity Western University v The Law Society of Upper Canada (court ruled in favour of LSUC), and Trinity Western University v Law Society of British Columbia (court ruled in favour of TWU). Both the Ontario and BC rulings were appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, with the Justice Centre intervening in both cases. On 15 June 2018 the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the law societies in 7‚Äì2 decisions for both Trinity Western University v Law Society of Upper Canada and Law Society of British Columbia v Trinity Western University. The majority decisions said that TWU's Community Covenant would deter LGBT students from attending the proposed law school and that equal access to legal education, diversity in the legal profession and preventing harm to LGBT students were in the public interest.  Campus Freedom Index  The Justice Centre publishes a yearly report authored by John Carpay, lawyers and staff, that rates Canadian universities and students' unions on their adherence to the principles of freedom of speech.Campus Freedom Index, accessed on 22 May 2014, http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2012/10/2012-campus-freedom-index1.pdf The annual report gives grades to universities and students' unions based on Justice Centre's opinion of the strength of their principles and procedures regarding freedom of speech as well as actions regarding freedom of speech. The Cape Breton University Students' Union criticized the Justice Centre's rankings as being politically motivated and using old information after it was docked for a ban on religious and political groups approaching people. Officials at Ryerson University defended itself against its low scores noting that the Justice Centre rankings fail to take into account legal anti-hate speech provisions under federal and provincial laws. Writer Lindsay Shepherd, former Teaching Assistant at Sir-Wilfrid Laurier University joined the Justice Centre in 2019.

Banking After school, Loewenstein worked as a stockbroker for Bache & Co.

Following the acquisition, the business was substantially expanded to include advice on issues and mergers, investment advice, and particularly currency trading. By 1971, the firm had become one of the principal dealers in London in investment dollars. That year, it undertook a capital raising with a target of a net ¬£940,000 to enable further expansion.\\"Leopold Joseph Holdings Limited\\". The Times. 11 January 1971. p. 20. In 1981, Loewenstein left to start his own company, Rupert Loewenstein Ltd, where most of his clients were new money, who he described as \\"much more interesting than old money. People with old money are nearly always having to be adjusted downwards; those with new money are much more realistic.\\" The Rolling Stones Loewenstein was the Rolling Stones' business adviser and financial manager from 1968 until 2007. In 1968, then working in London as a merchant banker, he was introduced to Mick Jagger by a mutual friend, art dealer Christopher Gibbs. According to Keith Richards, Loewenstein had never heard of Jagger before then.Richards, Keith, with James Fox (2010). Life. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson. p. 287. . Jagger was of the opinion that the Stones' then manager, Allen Klein, was not paying them everything they were due. Loewenstein is credited with transforming the Stones into a \\"global brand and one of the world's richest bands\\", in particular by encouraging them to take into account potential tax advantages in any decisions about where to record, rehearse or perform. He managed their release from an existing contract, which paid them almost nothing, and persuaded them of the tax advantages of leaving England and moving to the south of France. He channelled their earnings through a series of companies in the Netherlands, and got them to rehearse in Canada, rather than the United States, to reduce their tax bill. Richards said, \\"[t]he tax rate [in the U.K.] in the early '70s on the highest earners was 83 percent, and that went up to 98 percent for investments... It was Rupert's advice that we become non-resident\\".Richards & Fox. p. 289. Loewenstein also copyrighted the famous red tongue logo, and enlisted corporates sponsors such as General Electric for tours. Richards described how, until they started to tour large venues in the 1980s, the Stones did not make serious money. The first important one was the 1981 and 1982 tours which broke box office records. By then, Loewenstein had reorganised the band's finances so that they did not \\"get cheated out of eighty percent of the takings... On a fifty-dollar ticket, up till then, [the band got] three dollars. He set up sponsorship and clawed back merchandising deals. He cleaned out the scams and fiddles, or most of them.

He lived in RƒÅjag·πõha, present-day Rajgir, in the 5th century BCE. Sometimes described as the \\"Medicine King\\" (), he figures prominently in legendary accounts in Asia as a model healer, and is honoured as such by traditional healers in several Asian countries. Accounts about Jƒ´vaka can be found in Early Buddhist Texts in many textual traditions such as the PƒÅli and M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda traditions, as well as later Buddhist discourses and devotional AvadƒÅna texts. Textual traditions agree that Jƒ´vaka was born as a foundling of a courtesan, but not who his parents were exactly. Regardless, Jƒ´vaka was found and raised by people from the royal court of King BimbisƒÅra. As he grew up, Jƒ´vaka decided to travel to Tak·π£a≈õilƒÅ, to learn traditional medicine from a well-respected teacher. He turned out to be a promising student, and after seven years, started his healing profession in RƒÅjag·πõha. His medical feats gained him a reputation and he was quickly appointed as the personal physician of King BimbisƒÅra and the Buddha. As Jƒ´vaka came more into contact with the Buddha, he became an important supporter of the religion and eventually founded the Jƒ´vakarƒÅma monastery. Later, BimbisƒÅra was killed by his son AjƒÅta≈õatru, who usurped the throne. Eventually, Jƒ´vaka was instrumental in bringing him to see the Buddha, to whom the new king repented the deeds he had done. In the texts, Jƒ´vaka is depicted performing complicated medical procedures, including those that could be interpreted as brain surgery. Scholars are in debate to which extent these depictions have historical value. Regardless, Jƒ´vaka is honoured throughout Asian history by Buddhists, and to some extent by healers outside of Buddhism, as a model physician and Buddhist saint. Several medieval medical texts and procedures in India and China are attributed to him. Up until the present day, Jƒ´vaka is honoured by Indians and Thai as a patron of traditional medicine, and he has a central role in all ceremonies involving Thai traditional medicine. Furthermore, Jƒ´vaka's legendary persona has had an important role in helping to proselytise and legitimise Buddhism. Some of the details of Jƒ´vaka's accounts were adjusted to fit the local milieus in which they were passed on. The Jƒ´vakarƒÅma monastery was identified by the Chinese pilgrim Xuan Zang in the 7th century, and it was excavated in the 19th century. Presently, it is one of the oldest Buddhist monasteries with archaeological remains still in existence.  Sources  Chinese canon of Buddhist scriptures, numerous texts can be found about Jƒ´vaka. alt=Old monastery long rows of ancient manuscripts. The life of Jƒ´vaka is described in several early Buddhist textual traditions, that is, in the PƒÅli language, Chinese (from the Dharmaguptaka, Mahƒ´≈õƒÅsaka and SarvƒÅstivƒÅda traditions, all translated from Indic texts in the 5th century CE), Tibetan (M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda) and Sanskrit texts. Jƒ´vaka's story can be found in the texts of monastic discipline (PƒÅli and ) of which the oldest stratum can be dated back to the first half of the 4th century BCE. This stratum includes rules and regulations about medicine, also relating the life and work of Jƒ´vaka, and can be found in various textual traditions. Furthermore, in the Chinese canon of Buddhist scriptures, two separate discourses () can be found that are not part of the Vinaya, titled the ƒÄmrapƒÅlƒ´ and Jƒ´vaka S≈´tra (known as T. 554) and the similarly titled ƒÄmrapƒÅlƒ´ and Jƒ´vaka AvadƒÅna S≈´tra (T. 553). The latter two discourses originate from before the 5th century CE and between 7th and 10th century respectively, both translated from a Sanskrit or Central Asian source. Traditionally, the two translations were attributed to An Shigao (148180 CE), but this was probably an attempt to make them look more ancient and legitimate. Salguero argues that they were probably based on a translation made by Zhu Fahu (233¬±308 CE), as well as early Vinaya and 5th-century apocryphal material. Whereas the Vinaya accounts are intended for a monastic audience, the two Jƒ´vaka S≈´tras appear to be more popular versions of the account, meant for a wider lay audience. The T. 554 s≈´tra most likely incorporated and sometimes replaced the early Vinaya accounts in the Mahƒ´≈õƒÅsaka and SarvƒÅstivƒÅda canons, some of which have hardly been passed down as part of the Vinaya, and can therefore only be found within that s≈´tra. The other T. 553 s≈´tra is most likely based on the T. 554, but has been expanded using material from the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. Besides these sources, several AvadƒÅna texts also contain accounts about Jƒ´vaka. There are also numerous references to him in Indian literature that is not Buddhist, such as the MƒÅ·π≠harav·πõtti, a commentary to the SƒÅ·πÉkhyas≈´tra, and the satirical poems of K·π£emendra, the 11th-century Kashmiri poet. Historians Kenneth Zysk and C. Pierce Salguero have compared the different recensions of the story and have argued that none of them are the original text, and thus the original narrative cannot be known. Instead, they argue that the different narratives were adjusted to fit with local traditions. For example, Salguero argues that the medieval Jƒ´vaka S≈´tras that are not part of the Vinaya were written based on much indigenous knowledge of Chinese medicine: some of the healing methods Jƒ´vaka uses, both in the Jƒ´vaka S≈´tras and the Vinaya texts, are more Chinese than Indian, and many motifs in his biography are drawn from legends of other famous Chinese physicians. Zysk notes that the PƒÅli recension is more practical, whereas the traditions influenced by MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings deploy more magical and miraculous motifs. He also observes that the Tibetan and Sanskrit accounts depict more treatments that appear traditional Indian (ƒÄyurveda) in nature. Each recension has its own regional character in understanding the diseases and having Jƒ´vaka heal them, although there are also many similarities.  Accounts  upright=.8 Jƒ´vaka is described in Buddhist texts as a contemporary of the Buddha, who most scholars date to the 5th century BCE. There are significant differences in how Jƒ´vaka's early life is rendered according to the different textual traditions. In what appears to be the earliest version of the narrative, Jƒ´vaka is described as a foundling discarded by a courtesan with no royal blood, and was later found and raised in the court by Prince Abhaya. In later versions, the story has been embellished to appeal to a wider audience, as Jƒ´vaka's mother is identified with the courtesan of divine origin and Buddhist disciple ƒÄmrapƒÅlƒ´, and the previously unnamed father becomes none other than King BimbisƒÅra. Furthermore, some versions of the story attempt to show that Jƒ´vaka is the real \\"Medicine King\\", a title used for other legendary healers such as the Chinese healers Bian Que and Hua Tuo. Many motifs in these accounts point in this direction: for example, the Jƒ´vaka S≈´tras state that Jƒ´vaka was born with acupuncture needles and herbs in his hand, which is used as proof that Jƒ´vaka is superior to other Chinese healers. In the Sanskrit and Tibetan version, Jƒ´vaka is recognised and named the \\"Medicine King\\" by the court on three occasion, each time after a medical miracle. He is therefore also described as the \\"Thrice- crowned Physician\\". = The foundling = Texts from the earliest, PƒÅli tradition, as well as the Chinese Dharmaguptaka Vinaya and the T. 553 s≈´tra, describe that Jƒ´vaka was born in RƒÅjag·πõha (present-day Rajgir) as a child of a courtesan (; in the PƒÅli and Dharmaguptaka canons this was not ƒÄmrapƒÅlƒ´, but SalƒÅvatƒ´), who had him discarded on a trash heap by a slave. He was later seen by a prince called Abhaya, son of King BimbisƒÅra, who asked whether the child was still alive. When the people responded that it was, he decided to raise him and named him \\"he who is alive\\" (), for having survived the ordeal. The PƒÅli, Tibetan and Sanskrit traditions explain that his second name became KomƒÅrabhacca, because he is raised by a prince (), but scholars have suggested the name is more likely related to the KaumƒÅrabh·πõtya: ancient Indian obstetrics and pediatrics, one of the eight branches of the ƒÄyurveda. As he grew up, Jƒ´vaka learnt about his humble origins, and determined to find himself good education to compensate for his background. Without Prince Abhaya's awareness, he went to learn medicine at an ancient place of learning called Tak·π£a≈õilƒÅ (what the Greeks called Taxila), presently identified with a city in Islamabad, Pakistan. = The prince = upright=.8 Sanskrit texts and early Tibetan translations in the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda tradition state that Jƒ´vaka was born as an illegitimate child of King BimbisƒÅra and a merchant's wife, who in the Chinese Jƒ´vaka S≈´tras is identified with the courtesan ƒÄmrapƒÅlƒ´. In the Sanskrit and Tibetan recension however, the wife of the merchant remains unnamed, whereas ƒÄmrapƒÅlƒ´ is considered to be the mother of Prince Abhaya instead of Jƒ´vaka. The Sanskrit and Tibetan texts, as well the T. 554 s≈´tra, explain that the king had an illicit affair with the wife and later she informed him that she was pregnant. The king told the mother that if the child should turn out male, she should bring it to him to be raised in the court. When it was born, she had the child placed in front of the palace in a chest. The king had the chest brought in and asked whether the child was still alive. When his servants responded that it was, he called it \\"he who is alive\\" (Sanskrit and ). The king had the child raised in the court by a person called Zho-nu Jigmed in the Tibetan version of the story, and in the court the child's interest in medicine was sparked when he saw some vaidyas (physicians) visit. He therefore decided to train as a physician in Tak·π£a≈õilƒÅ. In the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya and the Chinese Jƒ´vaka S≈´tras, Jƒ´vaka considered his medical teachers in the court inferior and demonstrated his superior medical knowledge, after which he decided to further his studies in Tak·π£a≈õilƒÅ. During that time, Tak·π£a≈õilƒÅ was under Achaemenid rule, following the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley circa 515 BCE. = The heart-exposing disciple = Texts in the Chinese tradition relate that Jƒ´vaka was a crown prince in a kingdom in Central India. When the king died, his younger brother prepared an army to battle Jƒ´vaka. But Jƒ´vaka said to his brother that he had not much interest in the throne, because his mind was focused on the Buddha instead. He exposed his chest, showing a Buddha image engraved on his heart. The younger brother was impressed and called off his army. Because of this story, Jƒ´vaka is called the 'Heart-exposing Arhat' (). In all versions of the story, Jƒ´vaka gave up his claim to the throne to study in Tak·π£a≈õilƒÅ. He was probably sixteen when he went there. = Life in Tak·π£a≈õilƒÅ = Ruins of Achaemenid city of Taxila, Bhir Mound archaeological site, 6th century BCE. He was trained for seven years in Tak·π£a≈õilƒÅ by a ·πõ·π£i (seer) called ƒÄtreya Punarvasu, which Tibetan texts say used to be the physician of BimbisƒÅra's father. Jƒ´vaka learnt the classical ƒÄyurvedic medical treatises of the time, such as the Caraka Sa·πÉhitƒÅ (attributed to ƒÄtreya) and the Su≈õruta Sa·πÉhitƒÅ, although some later treatments of Jƒ´vaka also point at other medieval traditions of knowledge. ƒÄtreya helped Jƒ´vaka build up his observation skills. Jƒ´vaka became known for his powers of observation, as depicted in many stories. In one account, Jƒ´vaka looked at the footprint of an elephant and was able to describe the rider of the elephant in great detail, just basing himself on the elephants's footprint. Tibetan texts do state that Jƒ´vaka suffered from jealous fellow-students, however, who accused ƒÄtreya of favouring him, because he was from the court. In the PƒÅli and Chinese version of the story, ƒÄtreya then sent Jƒ´vaka and his fellow pupils to look for any plant in the forest that did not have medicinal qualities. Jƒ´vaka returned disappointed, however, telling ƒÄtreya that he could not find a single plant of which he did not recognise its medicinal qualities. When ƒÄtreya was satisfied with this progress, he gave Jƒ´vaka a bit of money and sent him off, but not before acknowledging him as his next successor. The remains of the alt=Remains of a four-squared building with round tower on top In the Sanskrit and Tibetan recensions, however, the test of the forest is done before accepting Jƒ´vaka in Tak·π£a≈õila, as opposed to the exam at the end of his studies. After Jƒ´vaka passed the test, was admitted and learnt at the centre for several years, he started to demonstrate his medical superiority and was recognised as such by ƒÄtreya. He finished his studies with ƒÄtreya and continued his studies at the city of Bhadra·πÖkara in Vidarbha, where he studied the textbook called the Sarvabh≈´taruta, which may refer to a book about magical chants and dharanis. After that, he traveled further and came in possession of a miraculous object that helped him to see through the human body and discover any ailments. In this account, which could also be found in the Jƒ´vaka S≈´tras, Jƒ´vaka came across a man carrying wooden sticks. In some accounts, the man seemed to suffer terribly because of the effect of the wooden sticks, being emaciated and sweating; in other accounts, the wooden sticks which the man carried allowed any by-passers to see through his back. Regardless, Jƒ´vaka bought the sticks and found that, according to most of the Chinese texts, one of the sticks originated from a miraculous \\"Medicine King Tree\\" (): the tree of Bhai·π£ajrayƒÅjan, who later MahƒÅyƒÅna texts would describe as a bodhisattva, a Buddha-to-be, focused on healing. The Tibetan and Sanskrit version, however, relates that there was a gem hidden between the sticks which was the source of the miracles. Regardless, the miraculous object enables him to see through a patient's body and diagnose his illness, as the object \\"illuminates his inside as a lamp lights up a house\\". These accounts may have led to a myth about an ancient \\"ultrasound probe\\", as imagined in medieval Buddhist kingdoms of Asia. = Life as a healer = According to the PƒÅli texts, on his way back to RƒÅjag·πõha, Jƒ´vaka needed money for his travelling expenses, so he was forced to start working in SƒÅketa. A rich merchant () asked for help for his wife, but since many physicians had failed to heal her, Jƒ´vaka was reluctant and stated that he would ask for no fee if his treatment was unsuccessful. He successfully treated her though, and was rewarded generously. After his return in RƒÅjag·πõha, he gave his first earnings to Prince Abhaya, who refused these but had Jƒ´vaka work in the palace. He quickly became wealthy because of his service to influential patients, including King BimbisƒÅra. Although he received good payments from his wealthy customers, the texts state he also treated poor patients for free. When King BimibisƒÅra suffered from an anal fistula, he called upon the help of Jƒ´vaka. After curing the king of his fistula, Jƒ´vaka was appointed by the king as his personal physician and as a personal physician to the Buddha. Jƒ´vaka was depicted healing a misplacement of intestines, performing an operation of trepanning on a patient, removing an intracranial mass and performing nose surgery. In T. 553, as well as in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, he healed a \\"disease of the head\\" by treating the patient with ghee through the nose, and he is depicted in PƒÅli texts as performing laparotomy, removing post-traumatic volvulus and a cesarean section on patients under some form of anaesthesia. This and some other descriptions of Jƒ´vaka's medical procedures follow the protocol of the Su≈õruta and Charaka Sa·πÉhitƒÅs closely. The Jƒ´vaka S≈´tras describe that he also performed acupuncture, but this must have been a Chinese interpolation in the narrative, since this was a Chinese practice. Painting of Jƒ´vaka (pictured left) by Jin Dashou, alt=Painting of a tall, older man sitting, with an earring. His head is surrounded by an aura, and there is a short bearded man, wearing a headpiece, standing next to him. In a more psychological case, Jƒ´vaka treated another se·π≠·π≠hƒ´, this time with a brain condition. After having performed brain surgery, he told the patient to lie still on the right side for seven years, on the left side for another seven years and on his back for yet another seven years. The patient lied on each side for seven days and could not lie still for longer, standing up from his sleeping place. He confessed this to Jƒ´vaka, who revealed to him that he ordered him seven years on each side just to persuade him to complete the full seven days on each side. In another case described in the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda texts, King BimbisƒÅra lent Jƒ´vaka to King Pradyota (), the King of Ujjeni, to heal his jaundice. Jƒ´vaka knew through the power of his magical wood that Pradyota was poisoned by a snake and could only be healed by using ghee, which Pradyota hated. Praydyota was prone to anger and Jƒ´vaka was in doubt whether he should try to heal him. Consulting the Buddha, the Buddha said that Jƒ´vaka had taken a vow in a previous life that he would heal people's bodies, whereas the Buddha had taken a vow that he would heal people's mindsJƒ´vaka then decided to attempt to heal the king. Therefore, Jƒ´vaka gave a decoction to the king containing ghee, without him being aware. Anticipating the king's response, Jƒ´vaka fled the palace on one of the king's elephants. When King Pradyota became furious as Jƒ´vaka expected, he sent one of his servants to catch and bring back Jƒ´vaka. The servant caught up with Jƒ´vaka, but as they were eating, Jƒ´vaka secretly served him a strong purgative. By the time they manage to get back to the palace, King Pradyota was healed and no longer angry, rewarding Jƒ´vaka generously for healing him. In the PƒÅli version, he rewarded him by giving him an expensive cloth, which Jƒ´vaka then offered to the Buddha; in the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda version, the king rewarded Jƒ´vaka by listening to the teaching of the Buddha, the only payment Jƒ´vaka accepted. Accounts in medieval Japanese and Chinese literature depict Jƒ´vaka offering baths to the Buddha and dedicating the religious merit to all sentient beings. The story was used in East Asian societies to promote the medicinal and ritual value of bathing, emphasizing the benefits of offering such baths to the monastic community as a form of \\"medical karma\\". Some scholars have pointed to accounts about Jƒ´vaka as evidence of ancient medical practices, with medical historians Thomas and Peter Chen stating that \\"[i]t is likely that the salient events of Jivaka's life and his medical feats are authentic\\" and analysing some of Jƒ´vaka's procedures from a viewpoint of scientific medical practice. Salguero is more skeptical, however, and argues that \\"[m]edical legends simply cannot be considered evidence of medical practice\\". = Role in Buddhism = Relief depicting Jƒ´vaka treating the Buddha's foot (below), after the unsuccessful murder attempt by the monk alt=Ancient relief showing the Buddha standing surrounded by several monks in the upper part, with one monk hurling a boulder at the far right. Below a man is kneeling and holding the feet of the Buddha, while a child is standing behind the kneeling man, holding some object. PƒÅli texts often describe Jƒ´vaka giving treatments to the Buddha for several ailments, such as when the Buddha had a cold, and when he was hurt after an attempt on his life by the rebellious monk Devadatta. The latter happened at a park called Maddakucchi, where Devadatta hurled a rock at the Buddha from a cliff. Although the rock was stopped by another rock midway, a splinter hit the Buddha's foot and caused him to bleed, but Jƒ´vaka healed the Buddha. Jƒ´vaka sometimes forgot to finish certain treatments, however. In such cases, the Buddha knew the healer's mind and finished the treatment himself. Jƒ´vaka tried to heal the Buddha using only objects that are regarded as reverential, such as parts of the lotus flower instead of herbs from trees. Tibetan texts stated that Jƒ´vaka very often checked up on the Buddha, up to three times a day. Jƒ´vaka not only cared for the Buddha, but also expressed concern for the monastic community, at one point suggesting the Buddha that he had the monks exercise more often. Apart from his role as a healer, Jƒ´vaka also developed an interest in the Buddha's teachings. One PƒÅli text is named after Jƒ´vaka: the Jƒ´vaka Sutta. In this discourse, Jƒ´vaka inquired about how to be a good lay devotee. He also specifically asked why the Buddha ate meat. The Buddha responded that a monk is only allowed to eat meat if the animal is not killed especially for himapart from that, meat is allowed. He continued by saying that a monk cannot be choosy about the food he is consuming, but should receive and eat food dispassionately, just to sustain his health. The discourse inspired Jƒ´vaka, who decided to dedicate himself as a Buddhist lay person. The Tibetan tradition has another version of Jƒ´vaka's conversion: Jƒ´vaka's pride that he thought he was the best physician in the world obstructed him from accepting the Buddha. The Buddha sent Jƒ´vaka to legendary places to find ingredients, and finally Jƒ´vaka discovered there is still a lot he dd not know yet about medicine, and it turned out that the Buddha knew a lot more. When Jƒ´vaka accepted the Buddha as \\"the supreme of physicians\\", he was more receptive to the Buddha's teachings and the Buddha started teaching him. Jƒ´vaka took upon himself the five moral precepts. alt=A white-clad man is sitting in a respectful pose talking to the Buddha in a pavilion. Two monks are sitting behind the white-clad man. PƒÅli texts relate that Jƒ´vaka later attained the state of ≈õrotƒÅpanna, a state preceding enlightenment. Having accomplished this, he started to visit the Buddha twice a week. Since he had to travel quite far for that often, he decided to donate a mango grove close to RƒÅjag·πõha and built a monastery there. The monastery was used by monks during the yearly rains retreat. Later on, Jƒ´vaka was the first layman recorded to offer robes to Buddhist monks. It was probably out of health considerations that Jƒ´vaka offered the robes, since before that time, Buddhist monks would usually sew their robes together from pieces of rag left behind, or from corpses, which was less hygienic. At the time of Jƒ´vaka's gift of robes, the Buddha was ill and this illness could be related to lack of hygiene. On a similar note, Jƒ´vaka is described to donate robes made of woollen material, to be used in the winter. At the end period of the Buddha's ministry, King BimbisƒÅra was imprisoned by his son AjƒÅta≈õatru, who usurped the throne. Attempting to starve his own father, AjƒÅta≈õatru heard that his mother tried to prevent BimbisƒÅra from starving. According to the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda texts, AjƒÅta≈õatru nearly killed his mother out of anger, but was stopped by Jƒ´vaka and a minister, who warned him that he would be considered a casteless outcast () if he killed his own mother. Later on, BimbisƒÅra did starve and died. AjƒÅta≈õatru developed a tumour after his father's death, and asked Jƒ´vaka to heal it. Jƒ´vaka said he needed the meat of a child to heal the tumour. As AjƒÅta≈õatru was planning to eat a child, he remembered that he killed his father. When he thought about the killing of his father, the tumour disappeared. AjƒÅta≈õatru became ashamed of what he had done. Eventually, Jƒ´vaka managed to bring AjƒÅta≈õatru to see the Buddha to repent his misdeeds. In the M≈´lasarvastivƒÅda texts, this happened after Jƒ´vaka raised examples of other evil people that could still be saved despite their misdeeds, and after Jƒ´vaka reminded AjƒÅta≈õatru that the Buddha was at the end of his life. In the MahƒÅsa·πÉghika texts, however, AjƒÅta≈õatru consulted his ministers about who he should go to look for counsel. Although his ministers recommended to see several other non-Buddhist teachers, eventually Jƒ´vaka suggested the new king to see the Buddha. In Buddhist texts, the Buddha declared Jƒ´vaka foremost among laypeople in being beloved by people, and the PƒÅli texts name him as example of someone with unwavering faith in Buddhism. Jƒ´vaka was that widely known for his healing skills, that he could not respond to all the people that want his help. Since Jƒ´vaka gave priority to the Buddhist monastic community, some people needing medical help sought ordination as monks to get it. Jƒ´vaka became aware of this and recommended the Buddha to screen people for diseases before ordaining, which the Buddha eventually did for five diseases. Although Jƒ´vaka was depicted as showing great respect for the Buddha and concern and help for the monastic community, there was at least one case in which he failed to show respect. This is the case of Pa·πá·π≠haka, a monk who was considered stupid by many. Jƒ´vaka also shared this opinion, and when he invited the Buddha and the monastic community for a meal, Pa·πá·π≠haka was the only monk he left out. The Buddha, arriving for the meal, refused to start eating, insisting that someone fetched Pa·πá·π≠haka. Jƒ´vaka sent a servant to get Pa·πá·π≠haka, but this servant was surprised to find 1,250 Pa·πá·π≠hakas walking around the monastery, as Pa·πá·π≠haka brings about a supernatural accomplishment. Eventually, the real Pa·πá·π≠haka joined the meal, but Jƒ´vaka still did not acknowledge the monk's mental prowess. Jƒ´vaka only changed his mind as Pa·πá·π≠haka showed another supernatural accomplishment, stretching his arm very long to help take the Buddha's alms bowl for him. Jƒ´vaka bowed at the monk's feet to request his forgiveness.  Legacy  Jivakarama Monastery in Rajgir alt=Monk holding hands folded, standing in front of ruins Medieval Chinese accounts about Jƒ´vaka tend be hagiographic in nature, and were used more in the proselytising of Buddhism than regarded as medical biography. Since healing knowledge and the proselytising of Buddhism were closely connected, praise for Jƒ´vaka's medical prowess also meant praise and legitimisation of Buddhism. In Chinese texts about medicine from the Six Dynasties period (early medieval), Jƒ´vaka figures most prominently of all physicians, and his stories influenced the stories about other legendary physicians, as well as being influenced by their narratives. In East Asia, Jƒ´vaka was associated with gynaecology, and the name Jƒ´vaka is related to ancient female pathology and paediatrics. Several medieval medical formulas were named after him, and he is referred to in numerous medical texts from at least the 4th century CE onward. In 6th-century texts of Chinese pharmacology, the adage \\"Everything on earth is nothing but medicine\\" is attributed to him. In 10th-century Chinese medicine, many treatises were associated with or attributed to Jƒ´vaka. There is also evidence that shows Jƒ´vaka was regarded as an important figure for Indian ƒÄyurvedic medicine: for example, ·∏åalha·πáa, an Indian scholar who lived between the 11th and 13th centuries, wrote in a commentary on the Su≈õruta Sa·πÉhitƒÅ that \\"Jƒ´vaka's compendium\\" was regarded as an authoritative text on children's diseases, though this text has now been lost. This does not mean that Jƒ´vaka was revered unanimously by all of Asia; several medieval Indian texts such as the MƒÅ·π≠harav·πõtti, and the poems of K·π£emedra, depict him, as well as other physicians, as impostors. Among Indian texts, Buddhist texts tend to stand out in that they give much honour to the occupation of the physician, and medical knowledge was highly respected. The former may be related to the doctrine of salvation of Buddhism, in which the Buddha is often described as a doctor that cures the ills of the human race. Jƒ´vaka is regarded by Thai people as the creator of traditional upright=1.1 Jƒ´vaka was and is for many Buddhists and traditional healers an icon and a source of inspiration. The figure of Jƒ´vaka is presented in ancient texts as evidence for the superiority of Buddhism in both the realm of the spiritual as well as the medical. The Jƒ´vaka S≈´tras and the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda version describe that when Jƒ´vaka meets the Buddha, the latter makes a statement that \\"I treat internal diseases; you treat external diseases\\", the word treat () in this context also meaning 'to reign over'. Throughout the medieval period, the accounts about Jƒ´vaka were used to legitimate medical practices. In the early Buddhist texts which were translated in Chinese, Jƒ´vaka was deified and described in similar terminology as used for Buddhas and bodhisattvas. He came to be called the \\"Medicine King\\", a term used for several legendary Chinese physicians. There is evidence that during the Tang dynasty (7th10th century), Jƒ´vaka was worshipped along the Silk Road as a patron deity of children's health. Today, Jƒ´vaka is seen by Indians as a patriarch of traditional healing, and is regarded by Thai people as the creator of traditional Thai massage and medicine. Thai people still venerate him to ask for assistance in healing ailments, and he plays a central role in nearly all ceremony that is part of traditional Thai medicine. Many stories exist about Jƒ´vaka's purported travels to Thailand. In the Sanskrit textual traditions, Jƒ´vaka is the ninth of the Sixteen Arhats, disciples that are entrusted to protect the Buddha's teaching until the arising of the next Buddha. He is therefore described in Buddhist texts as still being alive on a mountain peak called GandhamƒÅdana, between India and Sri Lanka. The monastery Jƒ´vaka presented to the Buddhist community came to be known as the Jƒ´vakarƒÅma VihƒÅra, Jƒ´vakƒÅmrava·πáa or Jƒ´vakambavana, and was identified by the Chinese pilgrim Xuan Zang ( 60264) with a monastery in Rajgir. The remains were discovered and excavated in the period from 1803 to 1857. The monastery is described by archaeologists as \\"... one of the earliest monasteries of India dating from the Buddha's time\\".

University of New Mexico After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1920, Johnson moved to New Mexico, where he hoped that the dry, warm climate would assist him in overcoming respiratory difficulties dating back to his wartime exposure to phosgene gas. He served as the athletic director at the University of New Mexico from 1920 to 1949. He became \\"the one-man physical education department\\" at a university that, in 1920, had only 227 students and no gymnasium or football field. For nearly 40 years, he served in multiple other positions, including head coach of the football, basketball, track and tennis teams, and an instructor of physical education. The Albuquerque Tribune later wrote: \\"For year after year Roy Johnson was the entire athletic coaching staff at the University. He coached football, basketball, track and tennis in addition to carrying a full teaching load.\\" In addition to coaching and teaching, Johnson was also assigned \\"the dubious task of building collegiate-level athletics facilities, many times doing the hard labor with his own hands.\\" He oversaw construction of Carlisle Gymnasium in 1928 and Zimmerman Field in 1938, the first football stadium at UNM.Terry Gugliotta, University Arena, Center for Southwest Research, University Archives. Archived from the original on January 19, 2008. Retrieved December 28, 2007.An Adobe Stadium, Duke City Fix, May 14, 2010. Johnson was the head football coach at the University of New Mexico from 1920 to 1930, compiling a record of 41‚Äì32‚Äì6. His 1927 team went 8‚Äì0‚Äì1, surrendering just 28 points. In 1929, he became the first football coach to have his team fly by airplane, for a game with Occidental College at the Rose Bowl, the first night game played by the Lobos.New Mexico Lobo Football 2013 Media Guide, p.142. During the early 1930s, he became an innovator in the use of arc lights to allow night games at UNM. In 1931, New Mexico joined the Border Conference as a founding member under the direction of Johnson and University of Arizona coach Pop McKale. Johnson was also the coach of the New Mexico basketball team from 1920 to 1931 and 1933 to 1940.New Mexico Lobo Basketball Media Guide 2013-14, pp.132-33. Basketball had been a varsity sport at UNM since 1899, but the team played only sporadic games. Beginning in 1922, Johnson established a regular schedule of games against other New Mexico colleges and the University of Arizona, and further regional schools were soon added. From 1924 to 1934, his teams compiled an impressive record of 104-38 (). Overall, in 18 years as the school's basketball coach, he compiled a record of 165‚Äì146 ().New Mexico Lobo Basketball Media Guide 2013-14, p.130. His win total stood as the school record for over thirty years and is currently third on its all-time list. For his many contributions, Johnson has been called the \\"architect of institutional sport and physical education in the American Southwest with particular application to The University of New Mexico.\\". In 1957, the University of New Mexico regents voted to name the university's new gymnasium the Johnson Gymnasium in his honor. Sports Illustrated reported on the naming of the gymnasium as follows: > Not often has a coach received so unique an honor as has Roy Johnson. While > still a member of the faculty at the University of New Mexico he has had a > modern, $2.5 million gymnasium and swimming pool named after him. But New > Mexico's regard for Roy Johnson had been building up since 1920... The > athletic program Coach Johnson built with Swedish determination has won him > the admiration and affection of his students and co-workers and the nickname > Ironhead. At the time of the gymnasium dedication, The Albuquerque Tribune wrote that his career at New Mexico made him \\"one of the best known figures of the southwest\\" and added: > Roy Johnson was a stern taskmaster. He believed in hard work and physical > fitness. His athletes often groaned but in after years they thanked Johnson > for what he had done for them. Johnson built character as well as muscle in > the men he coached. Family and later years Johnson and his wife, Clyda, had two sons, Steffen Roy William Johnson (born April 1923) and Edwin F. Johnson, and a daughter, Coral Johnson. At the time of the 1940 United States Census, they lived at 1815 Roma Avenue in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a spot that is now on the UNM campus between the University House and the duck pond. Johnson continued to live in New Mexico in his later years and was inducted into the New Mexico Sports Hall of Fame in 1974. He died in New Mexico in 1989 at age 97.

Cafaro, born December 15, 1957 is an American business executive, who is Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Ventas, Inc.(NYSE:VTR), an S&P; 500 healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) with enterprise value of $37 billion that owns approximately 1200 healthcare properties located through the U.S., Canada and the UK. Cafaro joined Ventas in 1999 as CEO and President when the company‚Äôs market cap was about $200 million and was in dire financial shape. She has been widely credited with the Company‚Äôs turnaround and its subsequent success. Under Cafaro‚Äôs leadership, Ventas was named the most successful financial publicly traded company for the first decade of the new century and in 2018 was voted as one of the world‚Äôs most admired real estate companies by Fortune magazine. Ventas is well- regarded for sustaining long-term performance; for the 19 years ending 3/31/2019, Ventas total shareholder return was 5,342%, compared with 669% percent for the MSCI US REIT Index and 180% percent for the S&P; 500 Index. The Company's compound annual total shareholder return (TSR) has exceeded 23 percent since January 1, 2000. Cafaro has been name the Top Performing Women CEO Ranked By Total Return by Forbes and has been listed as one of the best performing CEOs in the world for several years by the Harvard Business Review. Personal life Cafaro was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to a working class Catholic family; she has one younger sister. Her mother, Dee Francis, was first generation Christian Lebanese who grew up in an Arabic speaking household in Washington PA; she graduated as valedictorian of her high school class. Her father was born in Pittsburgh to a first generation Italian family with 13 children. His immigrant father and mother owned restaurants and bars; her father worked as a letter carrier for the US Postal Service. In 1966, her father began to learn about rare coins. Pretty soon, he would take his post office paycheck and have it cashed in silver dollars. Then, the entire family would go through the coins to identify the valuable ones. By 1970, he was able to open his own rare coin store in the Grant Building in Downtown Pittsburgh. Cafaro, who was the first in her family to go to college, said that her father used his earnings from the coin store to pay for her undergraduate education at University of Notre Dame. She has said that her hard-working, close-knit family has been the inspiration for her work ethic as well as her love of sports, especially the Pittsburgh Steelers. Cafaro said that when she was 16 she became transfixed with the Watergate hearings and decided she wanted to be either a lawyer or journalist. Her father introduced her to a prominent criminal defense attorney, Tom Livingston, who introduced her to his son Terry, then a high school student who had decided to attend Notre Dame, which Cafaro was also interested in attending. Cafaro and Terrance K. Livingston married in 1983 and are the parents of two adult children. Cafaro grew up in a family that loved Pittsburgh sports and she has often said that watching professional sports with her family helped to shape her as a leader. In December 2016, Cafaro became an owner and member of the Management Committee of the Pittsburgh Penguins, a National Hockey League team, who won the 2017 Stanley Cup for the second consecutive year. Cafaro and husband Terrance Livingston reside in Kenilworth, Illinois in a George W. Maher designed home on Sheridan Road. Education and early career Cafaro received her J.D. cum laude in 1982 from the University of Chicago Law School, where she was named its Distinguished Alumna in 2011, and her B.A. in government economics magna cum laude from the University of Notre Dame in 1979. During Law School, she was the research assistant for Edward H. Levi, the former President of the University and Attorney General of the United States, who had been appointed by President Gerald Ford to \\"restore trust in the Justice Department\\". She had summer associate stints at the law firms Jones Day in Cleveland (1980), Debevoise & Plimpton in New York (1981) and Cleary Gottlieb in New York (1982). In 1982‚Äì83 Cafaro served as a judicial clerk to the Hon. J. Dickson Phillips, United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Her two co- clerks, Bill Johnson and Tim Hester became the CEO of Duke Energy and the TVA, and the managing partner at Covington & Burling, respectively. She joined the firm Levy and Erens in 1983. She then helped found, as its only associate, a law firm currently named Barack, Ferrazano, Kirschbaum, & Nagelberg, LLP in 1984. From 1983 to 1997, Cafaro practiced real estate, corporate and finance law, Cafaro also taught real estate transactions and finance from 1988 to 1992 as an Adjunct Professor at Northwestern University Law School. She joined Ambassador Apartments Inc. (NYSE:AAH), a multifamily REIT as President and a Director, in 1997 where she helped to complete the successful sale of the company. Ventas Cafaro was hired as President and Chief Executive Officer to rescue Ventas, a healthcare REIT, in 1999 at a time when the company was on the verge of financial collapse. Its primary tenant ‚Äì Vencor, Inc., which accounted for nearly all of its revenue ‚Äì faced a serious cash squeeze and was unable to pay all of its rent. In addition, Ventas had $1 billion of bank loan debt and faced significant whistle blower claims related to Medicare fraud. Its portfolio of 271 senior nursing facilities and hospitals were largely dependent on Medicare payments to cover rent, at a time when the federal government‚Äôs reimbursements were declining. Cafaro's initial actions at Ventas were to restructure the bank debt, lead a global consensual restructuring of its main tenant Vencor so it could emerge from bankruptcy (renamed Kindred Healthcare, Inc: NYSE: KND after it emerged from bankruptcy in April 2001) and negotiate a settlement with the Department of Justice on its whistle blower suit. Once Ventas stabilized in 2002, Cafaro hired an executive management team and initiated a growth and diversification strategy. In 2003 she was named the company's Chairman of the Board. The Company completed several small acquisitions and then began a series of sizable transactions including the $1.2 billion acquisition of Provident Senior Living in 2005 and the $2 billion acquisition of Sunrise Senior Living REIT in 2007 as its total number of assets grew to more than 500, with an emphasis on diversifying into private pay senior living communities. In 2010 and 2011, Ventas completed more than $11 billion of acquisitions, doubling the company‚Äôs size to nearly 1,400 properties and establishing its role as one of the largest and best performing publicly traded REITs, with total shareholder return for the ten years ended December 31, 2011, of 721.3 percent. During that same period it consistently outperformed the S&P; 500 Index for each of the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. Meanwhile, Kindred's contribution to net operating income by early 2014 was reduced to 12 percent from nearly 100 percent 15 years earlier. Growth continued and in early 2014, Ventas once again expanded its international presence with the acquisition of private hospitals in the United Kingdom. On June 2, 2014, Ventas announced $3.5 billion in acquisitions that has expanded its presence in senior living and medical office buildings. In 2015, Cafaro announced two strategically innovative transactions. First, it spun off most of its post-acute care portfolio into a pure play real estate investment trust called Care Capital Properties Inc. (NYSE:CCP), which will allow Ventas to focus on its private pay portfolio and its potential for higher growth. And, it acquired the real estate of top-ten hospital company Ardent Healthcare Services, Ventas's first push into the hospital sector. That was followed by the announcement in the spring of 2016 that Ventas would move into the life science asset class with the $1.5 billion acquisition of Wexford Science & Technology.

Wild Boar had its Dutch premiere at the Nederlands Film Festival in Utrecht and was shortlist nominated for a Gouden Kalf for Best Short Documentary at The Netherlands Film Festival.

Baptist approach to the subject and peculiar way of telling the story found international recognition. AFI Docs described the film as \\"an otherworldly and poetic look at the classic conflict of Man vs. Nature.\\" and Hot Docs wrote:\\"A village in the Netherlands is invaded by wild boar and its inhabitants must choose: eat or be eaten. A meticulously crafted folklore atmosphere beautifully captures the challenges we face when modern society conflicts with nature.\\" In Switzerland, where the film won a Special Mention Award, Visions du R√©el published: \\"An epic and eccentric film. The technique borrows from codes of fiction, and scenes follow one another in surrealistic style with a touch of joyful black humour\\". Canadian FERNTV published their Top 10 Films @ Hot Docs and wrote: \\"Downright dark and chilling at times like that of The Blair Witch Project.\\" Film review website Film Threat described the film as: \\"Darkly humorous... a marvelous small gem\\".

It produces and markets a range of beer, wine, cider, RTDs and spirits, as well as dairy and other beverages (plain and flavoured milks, yogurts, cheese, juice and soy products). Lion was formed in October 2009 under the name \\"Lion Nathan National Foods\\" when Kirin Holdings Company Limited purchased brewer Lion Nathan and merged the business with National Foods, which it owned since 2007. In 2011, the company changed its name to Lion, with National Foods becoming a Melbourne-based subsidiary called Lion Dairy & Drinks. The company employs over 7000 people. History The original forerunner of the company was Brown Campbell & Co, the company of Logan Campbell and William Brown who established the Hobson Bridge Brewery in Auckland in 1840. By 1897 it was the largest brewery in the North Island if not the country. In May 1897 Brown Campbell & Co amalgamated with Louis Ehrenfried's Albert Brewery, which he had bought in 1878, to form Campbell and Ehrenfried.The Campbell and Ehrenfried Company Limited The Cyclopedia of New Zealand (Auckland Provincial District), published 1902 The new company was managed by Arthur Myers, Ehrenfried's nephew. In 1914 Campbell and Ehrenfried merged with the Great Northern Brewery, which owned the Lion brand. In 1923 ten breweries amalgamated to form New Zealand Breweries. Campbell and Ehrenfried merged its breweries into New Zealand Breweries but remained a separate company. Douglas Myers, grandson of Arthur Myers, became CEO of Campbell and Ehrenfried in 1965. The northern division of New Zealand Breweries adopted the name Lion Breweries in 1977. Campbell and Ehrenfried bought 19.9 per cent of Lion Breweries in 1981. By the late 1980s, New Zealand Breweries had developed into one of New Zealand's largest companies. In 1988 Lion Breweries took over LD Nathan & Co, New Zealand's largest retailer, which at the time owned Woolworths NZ, to form Lion Nathan, listed on both the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges under the symbol LNN. The same year, Woolworths' general merchandise division was rebranded DEKA, with ownership transferred to the Farmers Trading Company in 1992. In 1990 it became an Australasian business when it established a major presence in Australia by securing management control of Bond Corporation‚Äôs brewing assets, including the Tooheys Brewery in Sydney and Castlemaine Perkins in Brisbane. In 1998 Douglas Myers sold most of his 16 percent share in Lion Nathan to Kirin Brewery Company of Japan. In 2005, Lion Nathan made a takeover bid for the independent South Australian Coopers Brewery. The takeover was strongly opposed by Coopers' management, and was rejected at an Extraordinary General Meeting when 93.4% of the shareholders voted in favour of permanently removing the \\"3rd tier purchasing rights\\" of Lion Nathan, effectively preventing any current or future takeover bid.

Lionel Richie appeared in a television commercial to promote the device and reportedly received A$$1.5 million to appear in the promotional campaign. The introduction of the Tap King caused controversy, due to the perceived impact upon alcohol venues. Concerns were raised in regard to lower patronage rates for venues due to a greater incentive for consumers to drink beer in home environments.

The complex began its construction in 1993 and opened in 1994. It houses male inmates who are not suitable for a county prison due to their offense or physical limitations, primarily sex offenders. It can house up to 1702 prisoners in dorms that are triple bunks, double bunks, with some single beds. There is a separate unit for incorrigible inmates. Dooly has many different types of programs to help inmates and certain inmates are given the opportunity to participate in various activities. It also provides educational services and medical, recreation, library, chapel, and general work programs for all inmates assigned.  Habitation  The maximum housing capacity is 1702. It consists of nine living units of which the bottom range are 24 triple cells (72 beds), and the top range are doubled-bunked cells 120 beds per cell (240 beds), and one open living unit with four separate living areas, which contain 368 beds. There is one block that contains 71 beds, the isolation/segregation Unit. The Fast Track Unit is double bunked and houses 256 beds. Programs All Dooly's prisoners have the right to participate in different kinds of recreational programs offered by the prison, such as bee keeping. Some of these programs help improve the inmate's life and their chances after prison. Education is an option and inmates can learn to read and write, as well as earn their GED. Georgia Department of Corrections  Other individual and group activities are offered, such as counseling for sex offenders, family violence, or substance abuse. Georgia Department of Corrections  Dooly also offers re-entry skills and allows their inmates to practice different religion practices. Vocational activities such as food service, plumber, and electrical helper are also offered. Visitation Dooly State Prison allows inmates visitation days on Saturdays, Sundays, and state holidays. Visitors must be an immediate family member or another person that the inmate has placed on a visitors list. Special visits are allowed if there are special circumstances but must be approved by the warden at least 48 hours in advance. Visitors should schedule and confirm an appointment prior to their visit. The only personal items permitted during visitation is one car key and of course I.D. Dress code for all visitors are long sleeve shirts with no writings or drawings, no gym wear, if sandals are worn there must be straps on the back; basic colors such as white or gray are best. Controversies In 1996 eleven prisoners filed a lawsuit against the Dooly State Prison guards. They alleged that the guards ‚Äúengaged in sadistic and degrading abuse‚Äù. However, due to the passage of the Prison Litigation Reform Act which states that ‚Äúno federal action may be brought by a prisoner for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody, without a prior showing of physical injury‚Äù the lawsuit was rejected in an ‚Äú8-4 ruling‚Äù by the federal appeals court in Atlanta. In February 2014, inmate Mitchell Lavern Ludy, serving a life sentence for murder, placed a lawsuit against the institution stating that he was denied kosher food during Passover. Ludy asserted he was raised a Jew and claimed he was ‚Äúa victim of religious persecution and mental and emotional distress‚Äù as a consequence of being denied the ability to celebrate the holiday. Officers argued that he was not allowed kosher food due to the section of the prison in which he was housed. Ludy, however, declared that ‚Äúa memo was distributed saying Muslims housed in the same area could observe their holy month‚Äù He also declared in his statement that he previously told officers about replacing his food before the actual holiday date so they could take measures in doing so when the time came. Ludy placed his lawsuit for $16 million dollars but in May 2016, signed an agreement to settle the case for $200. In February 2016, Dooly was one of nine Georgia state prisons implicated in an FBI sting operation. This operation led to the indictment of 46 correctional officers on federal charges, ten of whom were Dooly State Prison employees. During the raid, FBI officers found contraband inside the prison such as ‚Äúcellphones, weapons and drugs‚Äù, much of which was illegally brought inside the prison by the officers.

History  The family was native to Jajarm in north-western Khorasan, but under its eponymous founder Bu Halim, the family migrated further west to eastern Khorasan, then ruled by the Ghaznavid Sultan Ibrahim (r. 1059-1099). The life of Bu Halim's son, Najm al-Din Zarir, is more known; he was a commander under the Ibrahim's son and successor Mas'ud III (r. 1099-1115) and is known to have made raids into India; he invaded Malwa and then further penetrated to Kalinjar and then as far to the Ganges. After this, Najm al-Din Zarir is no longer mentioned in any sources, and mention of the family first re-appears during the reign of Arslan-Shah, where two Bu Halim notables are mentioned; Imad al-Dawla Muhammad ibn Ali, the commander-in-chief (sipahsalar) of the Ghaznavid army in India, and his brother Rabi ibn Ali, whose office is unknown. However, Arslan-Shah's reign was short. His mother, a Seljuq princess named Gawhar Khatun, was treated badly, which resulted in her brother Ahmad Sanjar invading Arslan-Shah's domains, where he decisively defeated Arslan- Shah and made the latter's brother Bahram-Shah the new ruler of the Ghaznavid dynasty, while at the same time acknowledging Sejluq suzerainty. However, Arslan-Shah managed to survive the invasion, and fled to India, where he was supported by the Bu Halim brothers and other officers. After Ahmad Sanjar left the Ghaznavid capital of Ghazni, Arslan-Shah returned to the capital, where he defeated Bahram-Shah, but Ahmad Sanjar shortly returned and defeated Arslan- Shah, who once again fled, but was captured by a Seljuq commander, and was executed. However, the two Bu Halim brothers kept opposing Bahram-Shah. Imad al-Din Muhammad, who was still in India, managed to withstand an attack by Bahram-Shah, but in the end was defeated and captured at Lahore in 1119 by the latter. Because of Imad al-Din Muhammad's great service in India to the Ghaznavids, Bahram-Shah pardoned him and restored him as the commander-in- chief of the Ghaznavid army in India. However, Imad al-Din Muhammad, along with several of his sons such as Mu'tasim ibn Muhammad, shortly rebelled against Bahram-Shah, but he and his sons were killed by an army sent by Bahram-Shah. After this event, mention of the Bu Halim family completely disappears.

Frank Baum.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; p. 46. He is an African lion, but he speaks and interacts with humans. Since lions are supposed to be \\"The Kings of Beasts,\\" the Cowardly Lion believes that his fear makes him inadequate. He does not understand that courage means acting in the face of fear, which he does frequently. Only during the aftermath of the Wizard's gift, when he is under the influence of an unknown liquid substance that the Wizard orders him to drink is he not filled with fear. He argues that the courage from the Wizard is only temporary, although he continues to do brave deeds. The cowardly lion is in fact brave, but he doubts himself. In many scenes in this classic book and film, the Lion shows bravery in the face of danger, similar to the Scarecrow, who wants a brain whilst he is the smartest one, and the Tin Man, who wants a heart but cries to his detriment when he does anything remotely mean by accident and rusts himself still. Books Dorothy meets the Cowardly Lion, from the first edition. The Cowardly Lion makes his first appearance in the book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. He is the last of the companions Dorothy befriends on her way to the Emerald City where he ambushes her, Toto, Scarecrow, and Tin Woodman. When he tries to bite Toto, Dorothy slaps him. She calls the Lion a coward and the Lion admits that he is. The Cowardly Lion joins her so that he can ask The Wizard for courage, ashamed that he is not brave enough to play his cultural role of the King of the Beasts.L. Frank Baum,The Annotated Wizard of Oz, Michael Patrick Hearn, ed., New York, Crown, 1976; p. 148. Despite outward evidence that he is unreasonably fearful, The Cowardly Lion displays great bravery along the way. During the journey, he leaps across a chasm on the road of yellow brick multiple times, each time with a companion on his back, and then leaps back to get the next one. When they come into another, wider chasm, the Cowardly Lion holds off two Kalidahs while the Tin Woodman cuts a tall tree to cross it. In spite of his fears, he still goes off to hunt for his food, and he even offers to kill a deer for Dorothy to eat, but the idea makes her uncomfortable. The Wizard gives him a dish of unknown liquid, telling him it is \\"courage\\" to drink. In the remainder of the book, the Lion becomes almost like a bully and ready to fight. He accompanies Dorothy on her journey to see Glinda, and allows his friends to stand on his back in order to escape the Dainty China Country, where he damages the only church mentioned in an Oz book until Handy Mandy in Oz (1937). His favored companion is the Hungry Tiger. This may well be the \\"Biggest of the Tigers\\" he and his friends encounter in the Forest of Wild Beasts in the Quadling CountrySnow, p. 99. In this forest, all of the lions and many of the other animals have been eaten by a Giant Spider. The Lion finds the Giant Spider asleep and decapitates it. The Tiger and the other animals bow to him and ask him to be their king, and he promises to do so upon his return from accompanying Dorothy to Glinda. Glinda orders the Winged Monkeys to carry him back to the Forest once Dorothy has returned home. In the rest of Baum's Oz series, the Lion never again played a major role. In later books, The Cowardly Lion often accompanies Dorothy on her adventures. He is Princess Ozma's chief guardian on state occasions, and he and the Hungry Tiger pull Ozma's chariot. In subsequent Oz books by Baum, the Lion was shown to have continued being courageous and loyal, although still considering himself a coward and regularly frightened, even by Aunt Em. He befriended the Hungry Tiger in Ozma of Oz, if this was not the earlier Tiger (which The Patchwork Girl of Oz implies that it is by calling both Lion and Tiger \\"largest of their kind\\"), and the two have become Ozma's personal guards. In Glinda of Oz he is on Ozma's board of advisers. In \\"The Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger\\" in Little Wizard Stories of Oz, the Lion begins with cowardly bravado, intending to find a man to tear apart, and the Tiger a fat baby to devour. Instead, they find a small child (bigger than a baby) and return it to its mother. In his titular novel by Ruth Plumly Thompson, Mustafa of Mudge, a wealthy sultan at the southern tip of the Munchkin Country, kidnaps the Cowardly Lion for his large collection of lions that he feels would be incomplete without Oz's most famous lion. He was turned to stone by the giant Crunch, but rescued by American circus clown Notta Bit More and orphan Bobbie Downs, whom the clown prefers to call by the more optimistic- sounding Bob Up. For the most part in later Oz books, though, the Cowardly Lion is a cameo appearance rather than a major character. His other significant appearances include Ojo in Oz, where he is turned into a clock by Mooj and saved by Ozma and the Wizard. He assisted against the Stratovanians in Ozoplaning with the Wizard of Oz, Terp the Terrible in The Hidden Valley of Oz, and accompanied Dorothy and Prince Gules of Halidom in Merry Go Round in Oz. John R. Neill played him primarily as a beast of burden in his three Oz books. In all, the only three books in which the Cowardly Lion does not rate at least a mention are The Tin Woodman of Oz, Grampa in Oz, and The Silver Princess in Oz. (In The Marvelous Land of Oz he receives a bare mention in the eleventh chapter.) Film portrayals =His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz= In the 1914 film His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz, the Cowardly Lion was played by Fred Woodward. =The Wizard of Oz (1925)= In the 1925 silent film The Wizard of Oz, directed and starring Larry Semon, the Cowardly Lion was played in disguise by Spencer Bell. =The Wizard of Oz (1939)= Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion for the 1939 film. In the classic 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz, the Cowardly Lion was a humanoid biped and played by Bert Lahr, a popular vaudeville and Broadway star, with many of Lahr's trademark mannerisms deliberately worked into the film. In this version, the liquid courage given to him by the Wizard is replaced with a medal marked \\"Courage\\". Bert Lahr's biography, written by his son John Lahr, is entitled Notes on a Cowardly Lion. The movie was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which uses a lion as its mascot. In fact, MGM even considered using their mascot for the role of the Cowardly Lion. In the movie, the Lion walks on his hind legs instead of all four, except when he is first seen bounding out of the forest to attack Dorothy's friends. After roaring fiercely at them on all fours, he does stand up on his hind legs. Lahr also portrayed the Lion's Kansas counterpart, Zeke (one of Aunt Em and Uncle Henry's farmworkers). Screenwriter Noel Langley created this character for the film.http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&global;%5B_id%5D=73897 Zeke helps Hickory (Tin Man's alter ego) lower a bed into its place on a wagon at the farm. He then moves the hogs into the pig pen and pours feed into their trough. When Dorothy falls off the railing that encircles the pen, Zeke jumps in and rescues her. With Dorothy safe, Zeke sits down beside the pen, breathing heavily and seemingly about to faint. The others realize that he had been afraid of the pigs, and playfully mock him. Zeke wears his hat throughout the entire film because he does not struggle to open the cellar when the tornado approaches the farm. Hunk (Scarecrow's alter ego) closes and locks the cellar with him when Dorothy arrives at the farmhouse. Zeke and Professor Marvel (The Wizard's alter ego) are the only men wearing hats when Dorothy awakens from being unconscious. Cowardly Lion Courage Medal Cowardly Lion's courage medal used for the 1939 film. The original Courage Medal prop from the 1939 film, a cross-shaped medal made of poly-chromed metal and measuring 7.5 √ó 7.5\\" (19.1 √ó 19.1 cm), features a lion in profile above a crown and a knight's helmet and the word \\"Courage\\" in raised blue scroll lettering. In the late 1950s, Mal Caplan, the head of the costume department at MGM was in a life-threatening automobile accident, and spent months in the hospital before returning to work. For some time he was unable to sit upright and had to work from a chaise longue. In recognition of his courage, his colleagues and the management at MGM presented him with the Cowardly Lion's Courage Medal. He was also given the Tin Man's \\"heart\\", but he gave that to \\"someone who needed it\\", a man in the same hospital who was having open heart surgery. The current whereabouts of the heart clock are unknown. The Courage Medal remained in the Caplan family until it was consigned to a Sotheby's Entertainment Memorabilia auction in May 1997.Sotheby's Auction Catalog ‚Äì May 21, 1997Sotheby's Entertainment & Memorabilia Auction Beverly Hills, CA ‚Äì May 21, 1997 The medal was purchased by a New Jersey collector, and in November 2010 was featured on episode 7 of the TV show Hollywood Treasure. Cowardly Lion costumes An original Cowardly Lion costume from The Wizard of Oz was packed away after filming and forgotten for decades. It was found barely in time to be included in the landmark 1970 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer auction, where it sold for $2400 to a California chiropractor. In 1985, sculptor Bill Mack acquired it; he could not recall the exact price, but stated, \\"It was several thousand dollars, instead of several hundred thousand\\". He had it restored by a taxidermist and \\"recreated the headpiece with a lifelike sculpture of Lahr\\". In December 2006, he sold it for $826,000. Another costume currently resides in the Comisar Collection, the largest collection of television artifacts in the world. Curator James Comisar acquired the costume, after verifying to his satisfaction that it had been worn in the film, and set about restoring it. The major challenge was the weight of the tail caused rips across the back of the costume that needed to be patched, which was done by Cara Varnell, a textile conservation expert at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The Cowardly Lion's original facial appliances had been glued directly to Bert Lahr's face and did not survive the production, so Comisar asked Lahr's son, Herbert, to model for another face cast, as he had an uncanny resemblance to his father. Herbert Lahr remarked: > The Lion‚Äôs suit was very interesting. It was a real lion skin, and it > weighed 60 lbs. My dad had to be in it all day, he couldn‚Äôt eat because of > the way the mask was, so he had to eat his lunch through a straw. The Cowardly Lion's mane was re-created from human hair imported from Italy at a cost of $22,000, and more than twenty-one artisans worked for two years completing the conservation. Comisar's Cowardly Lion costume has been featured in the national media, including on The Oprah Winfrey Show, when it was then valued at $1.5 million. The costume is thought to be among the most valuable and iconic Hollywood objects in existence. ‚ÄúMost of us cannot relate to not having a brain or a heart; we can all relate to not having enough courage, and it is for this reason I believe the Cowardly Lion is the character we respond to the most,‚Äù said Comisar. Many potential buyers have expressed interest in buying the costume, but so far he has rejected all offers. Comisar's costume was offered by Bonhams in their TCM-themed auction that took place in New York City on November 24, 2014,Wall Street Journal \\"Old Pelt for Sale\\" November 14, 2014 where it received great interest and realized the selling price of $3.1 million,CNN Money \\"Cowardly Lion costume sells for $3.1 Million\\" November 24, 2014 and this is the highest known price point for a costume worn by a male performer in any Hollywood production. William Stillman, a noted historian and co-author of several books about the film, featured a full-page photograph of this Cowardly Lion costume in his book, The Wizardry of Oz: The Artistry and the Magic of the M.G.M. 1939 Classic. The accompanying text states, \\"While Bert Lahr appears to wear the same costume throughout the picture, others were available for dress rehearsals or for the stunt double to bound onto the Yellow Brick Road, leap through a window in the Emerald City, or scale the cliffs outside the Witch‚Äôs castle.\\"The Wizardry of Oz: The Artistry and the Magic of the M.G.M 1939 Classic, William Stillman and Jay Scarfone In 1998, both Comisar and auctioneering company Profiles in History, on behalf of Mack, insisted they had Lahr's costume. =The Wiz= In the 1978 film version of the all black Broadway play, the Lion was portrayed by Ted Ross, who won a Tony for his Broadway portrayal. David Alan Grier portrayed the Lion in 2015's The Wiz Live!. =Return to Oz= In the 1985 spiritual sequel to The Wizard of Oz, the Cowardly Lion is briefly seen at the end of the film. Unlike the 1939 film, this version is a puppet and walks on all fours. He is also shown growling rather than speaking. =The Oz Kids= In 1996, they made an animated cartoon series The Oz Kids. The Cowardly Lion rules the kingdom to the south of Emerald City, Quadling Country and has two cubs, Bela and Boris. His son Boris is afraid of things just like his dad. =Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return= The Cowardly Lion appeared in the animated film Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return (which is based on Dorothy of Oz), voiced by Jim Belushi. =Oz: The Great and Powerful= The Cowardly Lion makes a brief cameo in Oz: The Great and Powerful, as a CGI character. He briefly tries to attack Oz (played by James Franco) and his monkey companion Finley (voiced by Zach Braff), but Oz uses his magic to create a velvet fog that intimidates the lion, causing him to immediately retreat. Recent works and parodies *In the 1961 animated TV series, Tales of the Wizard of Oz and its sequel, the 1964 NBC animated television special Return to Oz, the Lion (here named Dandy Lion) was voiced by Paul Kligman. *In a 1979 episode of The World's Greatest Super Friends, Wonder Woman temporarily became the Lion after a tornado took her, Superman, and Aquaman to Oz. While passing Mister Mxyzptlk‚Äôs dangerous landscape, she had lower legs of an African lion. She did not get returned to normal until she reached the Wizard (Mister Mxyzptlk himself) with Superman and Aquaman. *In a 1981 episode of Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo, Scooby is dressed as the Lion after a tornado took him, Shaggy, and Scrappy to \\"Ahz\\", a direct spoof of Oz with a different spelling by its enunciation. *He appears in the 1990 The Wizard of Oz cartoon, voiced by Charlie Adler. The Cowardly Lion has his brave/cowardly persona intact, and even gets to wear the Ruby Slippers for a short while in one episode. *Nathan Lane performs as this character in the 1995 television stage performance The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True. The Kansas farmworker Zeke does not appear in this production. He sings the longer version of \\"If I Only Had the Nerve\\" including the bridge verses sung by the Scarecrow (Jackson Browne), Tin Man (Roger Daltrey), and Dorothy (Jewel). In his version of If I Were King of the Forest, he has an addition into the lyrics \\"Not queen, not duke, not prince...or the Artist Formerly known as Prince\\". *The Cowardly Lion is a minor character in author Gregory Maguire's 1995 revisionist novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West and its 2003 Broadway musical adaptation. In both works, he is first seen as a Lion Cub (lion with human attributes) who has been torn from his mother and used as an experiment (in the book by Doctor Dillamond's replacement, Doctor Nikidik, and in the musical an agent of the Wizard) on the nature of Animals. Elphaba (the future Wicked Witch of the West) saves the Lion Cub that in the end of both adaptations attempts to kill her. He also appears in Maguire's 2005 sequel Son of a Witch, also in a minor role. The Cowardly Lion is the central character in the third book of the series, A Lion Among Men, where he is given the name of Brrr, which was the name given to him in Wicked. Doctor Nikidik mentions that he intended to give the Lion Cub the name of Prrr, but since \\"it shivers more than it purrs,\\" he names it Brrr. *\\"Home\\", a 2002 song from American rock band Breaking Benjamin, references a \\"cowardly lion\\" in its lyrics. *In the 2005 ABC television film The Muppets' Wizard of Oz, Fozzie Bear plays the role of the Lion. Fozzie's other role is himself. He shows up at the end of this film in the Muppets' show. *In the 2007 VeggieTales episode The Wonderful Wizard of Ha's, he is renamed the \\"Hungry Lion\\" who was played by Pa Grape. His Kansas counterpart from the 1939 film also appeared in this Christian cartoon. *In the 2007 Sci Fi television miniseries Tin Man, the Lion is re-imagined as a character named Raw, a member of the race of Viewers - half-man, half-lion beings with telekinetic and empathic abilities. He is played by Raoul Trujillo *The Cowardly Lion appears in the 2011 direct-to-DVD animated film Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz, voiced by Todd Stashwick. *The Cowardly Lion appears in 2012 film Dorothy and the Witches of Oz, played by Barry Ratcliffe. He appears on Earth in the form of Dorothy Gale's lawyer Bryan Jennings. *From the 2014 Dorothy Must Die novel by Danielle Paige, an adaptation that is a dark sequel to the original Oz series where Dorothy and her friends have been corrupted by her use of magic and the gifts they received from the Wizard, the Lion has become a giant, brutal warrior who walks on his hind legs, draining the fear from others to increase his own strength. In the second novel in the series in 2015, The Wicked Will Rise, protagonist Amy Gumm is able to take the Lion's courage by cutting off his tail, realizing that it has been sewn onto his hindquarters, but Amy spares the Lion despite being tempted to kill him. The Lion is subsequently bound and forced to fight for Dorothy despite his fear, forcing Amy to kill him despite her past actions. *In 2015, The Cowardly Lion appears in Lego Dimensions, voiced by Jess Harnell. *The Cowardly Lion appears in the Once Upon a Time episode \\"Where Bluebirds Fly\\". Though he doesn't speak, the Cowardly Lion still has his traits. The Cowardly Lion was a line of defense for the Crimson Heart that is sought out by Stanum and Zelena. After the Cowardly Lion attacks Stanum, he is driven away by Zelena. *In the TV 2017 series Emerald City, the Cowardly Lion analogue is Eamonn and is portrayed by Mido Hamada. He is presented as unquestioningly loyal member of the Wizard's Guard who is personally tasked with finding Dorothy before she reaches Emerald City and doing whatever it takes to prevent the return of the Beast Forever. As the series unfolds, he is revealed to have assisted the Wizard of Oz in killing the Royal Family of Oz when the Wizard first came to power, but initially spared the princess Ozma as she reminded him of his own daughter. When Ozma learns of her past and assumes her role as leader of Oz, she punishes Eammon by condemning him to be trapped in the form of a beast, turning him into a Lion due to the lion mask he wore when killing her family. *In 2017, The Cowardly Lion first appears in Lost In Oz, voiced by Keith Ferguson. *In 2017, The Cowardly Lion appears in Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz, voiced again by Jess Harnell. *In 2019, The Cowardly Lion appears in The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part. Alongside Dorothy and her friends, the Cowardly Lion is somehow transported from the Land of Oz to Harmony Town in the Systar System. Speculated origins In the original Oz books, the Lion's origins were never explicitly stated. However, many works since then have either hinted at or revealed elements of backstory for the Cowardly Lion. Partly due to the large amount of written material about Oz, many of these stories are contradictory to each other or to the \\"Famous Forty\\" Oz books, and many fans do not accept them as canonical. The canonical books give no indication the Lion did not originate in Oz, essentially as a normal, if unique, lion. A skittish and fearful lion cub is seen at Shiz University in Gregory Maguire's novel, Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. The cub had been the result of cruel experiments by Dr. Dillamond's replacement teacher (in the musical, it was an agent of the Wizard) and was saved by Elphaba and some other students. This is heavily hinted to be a younger form of the Cowardly Lion. The Tin Woodman confirms this in the Broadway musical adaptation Wicked, in the song \\"March of the Witch Hunters\\": \\"And the lion also has a grievance to repay! If she'd let him fight his own battles when he was young, he wouldn't be a coward today!\\" The book Lion of Oz and the Badge of Courage and its accompanying animated feature, Lion of Oz, show the Lion as having grown up in a circus in America. His caretaker, Oscar Diggs, was the man who would become the Wizard of Oz; this man took the Lion on a balloon ride one night, which resulted in the two becoming stranded in Oz. Gregory Maguire's most recent book, A Lion Among Men, is told primarily from the Lion's viewpoint, and its plot is centered around Brrr's account of his own origins, or lack thereof (he is unsure, as his narration begins, of the whereabouts of his parents, pride, etc.). The film Oz the Great and Powerful shows Oscar Diggs driving away an attacking lion with a smoke bomb, suggesting that this lion is Dorothy's future companion. In the 2017 TV series Emerald City, the Lion is a former guard in the Wizard's army who is cursed into the form of a beast for his actions against the former Royal Family of Oz. Political interpretations Some historians, such as Henry M. Littlefield in American Quarterly,Gerald Leinwand, William Jennings Bryan: An Uncertain Trumpet, Lanham, MD, Rowman and Littlefield, 2007; p. 171. have suggested that Baum modeled the Cowardly Lion after politician William Jennings Bryan, or politicians in general.

It falls under the operational limits of Madurai Railway Division of the Southern Railway Zone. It is a major as well as an important passing station present on the Tiruchirappalli- Karaikkudi railway line. It is under the station category B. The station serves as an alternative rail route to the southern districts of Tamil Nadu.  History  As early as 1886, a plan to link Pudukkottai by rail with Trichy and other places was mooted. But as the princely state of Pudukkottai was ruled by a king while most other parts of South India were under the British, protracted negotiations between these two authorities took place, specially with regard to the cost-bearing of the proposed railway line. Later, in 1921, a traffic-survey of the proposed Tiruchirapalli- Pudukkottai- Karaikudi- line was prepared by Rao Sahib S. Krishnamachari of South Indian Railways (SIR). It was estimated that the cost of construction of the railway line would work out to Rs 1.32 lakhs per mile. After a brief period of construction, the Trichy- Pudukkottai line was inaugurated on 17 April 1929 and Pudukkottai- Manamadurai line on 1 July 1930.http://nmma.nic.in/nmma/GlbSearch.do?method=SearchviewApproval&sheetcode;=TN22003707  Location and layout  Pudukkottai railway station as seen from foot over bridge The railway station is located about from the new bus stand. It is not easily accessible as it is located far away from the main town. It can be accessed through a cab or an auto. Before the gauge conversion, the station had only 3 tracks. Now an additional fourth track has been constructed for handling goods trains. As it is a passing station, there are no pitlines available. There is also a considerable amount of space available for the extension of the railway station in future.  Services  All the trains bound to Karaikkudi, Manamadurai and few trains bound to Rameswaram and Kanyakumari from Chennai Egmore and Tiruchirappalli pass through this station. All the trains have a stoppage here for a minimum of 1‚Äì2 minutes.

He was the Director of Security at First Look Media and a contributing writer at The Intercept. His research on security, surveillance and censorship has been on the front pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post, and covered in news media including the BBC News, Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal, and Der Spiegel. His work tracking the digital component of the ongoing Syrian Civil War is in the book Black Code: Inside the Battle for Cyberspace. Marquis-Boire previously served as an advisor to the Freedom of the Press Foundation. He was a Special Advisor to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and advisor to the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute. Marquis-Boire resigned in September 2017 from his position on the technical advisory group at Citizen Lab, a multi-disciplinary advanced research laboratory at the University of Toronto. Citizen Lab later disclosed that, after his resignation, it received an allegation of a 2014 sexual assault involving Marquis-Boire. He has been profiled by Wired, CNN, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, and Tages Anzeiger. He was one of Wired Italy 's Top 50 people of 2014. In March 2015 he was named a Young Global Leader. Early life Marquis-Boire was born in New Zealand. He began hacking as a teenager under the name headhntr. He holds a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Auckland. Internet censorship research Marquis- Boire conducted research into Blue Coat Systems, a Palo Alto company which provides Internet blocking and monitoring solutions. Reports include Some Devices Wander by Mistake: Planet Blue Coat Redux (2013), and Planet Blue Coat: Mapping Global Censorship and Surveillance Tools (2013). This research has been covered in news media including the front page of the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Globe and Mail, and the Jakarta Post. Following the publication of these reports, Blue Coat Systems announced that it would no longer provide ‚Äúsupport, updates, or other services‚Äù to software in Syria. In April 2013, the US government's Bureau of Industry and Security imposed a fine of USD 2.8 million on the Emirati company responsible for purchasing filtering products from Blue Coat and exporting them to Syria without a license.  Internet surveillance research Marquis-Boire has conducted research on the global proliferation of targeted surveillance software and toolkits, including FinFisher and Hacking Team. FinFisher is a suite of remote intrusion and surveillance software developed by Munich-based Gamma International GmbH, marketed and sold exclusively to law enforcement and intelligence agencies by the UK-based Gamma Group. In 2012, Morgan Marquis-Boire and Bill Marczak provided the first public identification of FinFisher's software. Marquis- Boire and collaborators have done investigations into FinFisher including: revealing its use against Bahraini activists, analyzing variants of the FinFisher suite that target mobile phone operating systems, uncovering targeted spying campaigns against political dissidents in Malaysia and Ethiopia, and documenting FinFisher command and control servers in 36 countries. This research has informed responses from civil society organizations in Pakistan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. In Mexico, local activists and politicians collaborated to demand an investigation into the state‚Äôs acquisition of surveillance technologies. In the UK, it led to a crackdown on the sale of the software over worries of misuse by repressive regimes. Hacking Team is a Milan, Italy-based company that provides intrusion and surveillance software called Remote Control System (RCS) to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Marquis-Boire and collaborators have mapped out RCS network endpoints in 21 countries, and have provided evidence of RCS being used to target a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates,; a Moroccan media organization,; and an independent news agency run by members of the Ethiopian diaspora. Following the publication of these reports, the EFF and Privacy International took legal action related to allegations that the Ethiopian government had compromised the computers of Ethiopian expatriates in the US and the UK. At the 23rd USENIX Security Symposium, Marquis-Boire and other researchers released the paper When Governments Hack Opponents: A Look at Actors and Technology, examining the government targeting of activists, opposition members, and NGOs observed in Bahrain, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates.  Digital campaigns in the Syrian Civil War  From 2012 to 2017, Marquis-Boire reported on digital campaigns targeting Syrian activists with the EFF and Citizen Lab.; ; Many of these findings were translated into Arabic and disseminated along with recommendations for detecting and removing malware. This work has been on the cover of BusinessWeek, and covered in The New York Times, Al Jazeera, and Wired. On December 31, 2013, Marquis-Boire gave an interview covering this work on the NPR radio show All Things Considered.  Other work  In 2012, he gave a presentation on the use of targeted malware attacks during the Arab Spring at the Black Hat Briefings in Las Vegas which covered the use of malware campaigns for the purposes of digital surveillance and espionage in Libya, Syria, Bahrain, Morocco, and Iran. He released a paper with Eva Galperin of the EFF on the targeting of the Vietnamese diaspora with malware attacks. This detailed an ongoing state-sponsored hacking campaign targeting prominent bloggers, academics, and journalists. Marquis-Boire has given interviews in the wake of the global surveillance disclosures with Die Zeit, International Business Times, and Dazed. He was named in Al Jazeera's \\"Media Trends to Watch in 2015\\". Shane Huntley and Marquis-Boire co-authored a paper on government targeting of journalists and media organizations presented at Black Hat Singapore 2014. This paper reported that 21 of the world's top 25 media organizations had been targeted by state-sponsored hacking. In April, 2015, Marquis-Boire spoke at the Western Regional Conference of the Society of Professional Journalists in San Francisco, California and presented a paper entitled \\"Data Security for Beginners\\". At Black Hat USA 2015, held in Las Vegas in August, Marquis-Boire presented a paper entitled \\"Big Game Hunting: The Peculiarities of Nation-State Malware Research\\". Marquis-Boire presented a paper entitled \\"Security for Humans: Privacy and Coercion Resistant Design\\" at the Strange Loop Conference in St. Louis, Missouri, in September 2015. In May 2016, he was in the \\"State of Surveillance\\" episode of the HBO series Vice, along with Edward Snowden and Ron Wyden. Resignation and sexual assault allegations In September 2017, Marquis-Boire resigned from his position as a senior researcher at Citizen Lab. In October, the organization cut all ties with him after it had been informed that he had been accused of sexually assaulting an individual at the 2014 Cyber Dialogue event. The EFF also released a statement saying that Marquis-Boire was no longer associated with them. In November, The Verge published a report of specific claims of assault and rape, and a second article contained more claims, including alleged quotes and chat extracts where Marquis-Boire admits to having \\"drunkenly sexually assaulted or raped women ‚Äî the exact number of which I am currently determining.\\" The number of women quoted in the articled as having been sexually assaulted or raped is at least ten.https://www.fastcompany.com/40499165/john-draper-hacker-who-inspired- apple-responds-to-sex-assault-claims References External links *Morgan Marquis-Boire at Citizen Lab *Morgan Marquis-Boire on twitter *Morgan Marquis- Boire on github *Morgan Marquis-Boire on medium Category:Computer security specialists Category:Living people Category:University of Auckland alumni Category:1980 births Category:New Zealand computer scientists ","title":"Morgan Marquis-Boire"},{"id":"42835399","text":"John Wallis (1714 ‚Äì 19 July 1793) was an English cleric, antiquarian, naturalist and county historian.

He matriculated at The Queen's College, Oxford, on 3 February 1733, graduated B.A. in 1737, and proceeded M.A. Having taken holy orders, Wallis held a curacy for a few years in the Portsmouth area. He then became curate of Simonburn, Northumberland. On the death of its rector in 1771, the living was given to the overbearing James Scott who, it was said \\"had more regard for his spaniels than his curate\\". Wallis, had to leave, and was taken into the family of his college friend Edward Wilson, vicar of Haltwhistle. In 1775 Wallis acted as temporary curate at St Andrew's Church, Haughton-le-Skerne, and in the same year was appointed to Billingham, near Stockton-on-Tees, where he remained till midsummer 1792, when illness obliged him to resign. In 1779 Thomas Pennant tried without success to secure him some preferment, from the Bishop of Durham. About two years before his death a small estate fell to him by the death of a brother, and Bishop Shute Barrington allowed him an annual pension from the time of his resigning the curacy of Billingham. Wallis then removed to the neighbouring village of Norton, where he died on 19 July 1793. He left a collection of books, mainly on natural history. Works Wallis had a taste for botany, and spent two decades researching a county history of Northumberland. The Natural History and Antiquities of Northumberland, and so much of the County of Durham as lies between the Rivers Tyne and Tweed, commonly called North Bishoprick (London, 1769, 2 vols.) was Wallis's major work. The first volume, which is the more complete, deals with minerals, fossils, plants, and animals of the county, the plants being named according to John Ray, and including cryptogams; the botanist Nathaniel John Winch considered he had misidentified a few plants. The second volume covered antiquities, arranged in three tours through the county. Some of Wallis's letters to the antiquary George Allan were printed in John Nichols's Literary Anecdotes (viii. 759‚Äì60). In 1748 he published, by subscription, The Occasional Miscellany, in Prose and Verse (Newcastle upon Tyne, 1748, 2 vols.). It contained sermons and two poems, The Royal Penitent: or Human Frailty delineated in the Person of David, in about four hundred rhyming couplets, and The Exhortation of the Royal Penitent, a paraphrase of Psalm 107. Family Wallis's wife of 56 years, Elizabeth, survived until 1801; the match was considered very happy.

Life and work  He was the son of a goldsmith from Mecklenburg. At the age of fifteen (after a problematic youth that included three years in a reformatory) he expressed a desire to be a painter but his father opposed the idea, sending him instead to the construction tradeschools in Zittau and Dresden to study draftsmanship. He was able to gain a short-term position in the studios of Gottfried Semper while he was in Dresden. In 1848, he received a commission to help prepare designs for a museum ceiling in Basel, under the direction of Melchior Berri. This type of work proved to be unsatisfying, however, and he was encouraged to go to Munich for further studies. After failing to obtain a position in the studios of Joseph Karl Stieler, he encountered Richard Zimmermann, who he knew from Zittau, and became his pupil. He decided to specialize in landscape painting and held his first exhibit in 1855. Initially, he focused on the Alps and Upper Bavarian lakes. In 1861 he took a trip to Paris, where he had his first encounter with the Barbizon School. This confirmed him in his belief that landscapes should be natural, focus on overall effect rather than detail, and be what one might now call \\"deceptively simple\\". In 1864 he returned to Paris, where he spent his time copying the old masterpieces in the Louvre. He was especially interested in the work of Jules Dupr√©, and visited with him in L'Isle-Adam that winter. In 1868 he opened an art school which he operated until 1873, when his health began to decline, due to a heart condition. After that time he continued to teach, but took a much less active role in the school. Hoping to find some rest and recovery, he planned to spend the winter of 1882 in the South Tyrol, but died of a heart attack shortly after arriving.

It is unusual within Fleetwood Mac's catalogue as it focuses on the period between the successful Peter Green period and the start of the Bob Welch period which eventually led to another successful period for the band in the mid to late 1970s. Packaged as a double CD with a DVD interview with guitarist Jeremy Spencer, it came in a cardboard box with a foldout inner sheet. The release also included four tracks by the Christine Perfect Band, which was planned as a project for Christine Perfect in 1969, after her brief solo career. This was later abandoned and she joined Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1970.Madison Blues liner notes by Martin \\"Jet\\" Celmins This boxed release should not be confused with another Fleetwood Mac compilation album of the same name, a single disc released in 1994, which consists of selected material from the Live in Boston concerts. Madison Blues has since been repackaged several times as single disc releases. Perfect Days (2008) and Perfect in Every Way (2010) are identical compilations of tracks from disc one of this set; while Crazy About the Blues (2010) and Preaching the Blues (2011) are identical to discs one and two of Madison Blues respectively.

Tracks 8‚Äì9 on disc one were recorded on 24 November 1970 at Maida Vale for the Mike Harding ‚Äì Sound of the Seventies programme. Tracks 10‚Äì16 on disc one were recorded live in concert in 1970, and disc two was recorded live in concert in January 1971, shortly before Jeremy Spencer left the band in February.

(1733‚Äì1814) was an English cleric, academic and political writer, known for his \\"Anti-Sejanus\\" letters. James Scott, 1781 portrait Life The son of James Scott, incumbent of Trinity Church, Leeds, by Annabella, daughter of Henry Wickham, he was born at Leeds in 1733. He was educated at Bradford Grammar School, St. Catharine Hall and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1757, proceeded M.A. in 1760, B.D. in 1768, and D.D. in 1775. He was elected fellow of Trinity College in 1758, and was a frequent and admired preacher at St. Mary's between 1760 and 1764. Scott was lecturer at St John's, Leeds, between 1758 and 1769, and curate of Edmonton between 1760 and 1761. In 1771, through Lord Sandwich's interest, he was presented to the rectory of Simonburn, Northumberland, where he spent much time and money in trying to get in his tithes. Worsted at law, some of his parishioners made an attempt on Scott's life. He then moved to London, where he died on 10 December 1814. Works In 1765, under the inspiration of Lord Sandwich and using the pseudonym \\"Anti-Sejanus\\", Scott contributed to the Public Advertiser a series of diatribes against Lord Bute. They were reprinted in 1767 in A Collection of Interesting Letters. He was also the author of the pieces signed \\"Philanglia\\" which appear in the same collection, and of others published with the signature of \\"Old Slyboots\\" in 1769, and collected in Fugitive Political Essays, London, 1770. Scott was three times successful in the competition for the Seatonian prize, with poems Heaven, Purity of Heart: a Moral Epistle, and An Hymn to Repentance (Cambridge, 1760‚Äì3). He was also author of: * Odes on Several Subjects, London, 1761. * The Redemption: a Monody, Cambridge, 1763‚Äì4. * Every Man the Architect of his own Fortune, or the Art of Rising in the Church, a satire, London, 1763; and * Sermons on Interesting Subjects (posthumously with his Life by Samuel Clapham), London, 1816.

The component leads must be accurately immersed in the solder paste previously deposited on the PCB pads. The next step after component placement is soldering.  Placement inputs  * Flexible placer, chip shooter, and other specialized machines. * PWB with solder print. * Components supplied by feeders. * Computer files: computer program controls location of each component on the PWB (X, Y and angular theta), feeder inventory levels, placement machine vacuum holder capability, automatic component realignment, placement accuracy, vision systems, and transportation of PCBs through the lime.  Placement process  Basic placement sequence generally includes: board indexing, board registration, fiducial vision alignment, component pick-up, component centering/vision inspection, component placement and board indexing. Component pick-up, component centering/vision inspection, component placement are repeated for each component. Sometimes, adhesive dispensing and on-line electrical verification are also included in the sequence. Through the process of board indexing, the stencil-printed PWB is loaded to the appropriate position. Fiducial marks, also known as fiducial markers, provide common measurable points for all steps in the assembly process. There are many types of fiducials. Global fiducials are used to locate the position of all features on an individual printed circuit board. When multiple boards are processed as a panel, the global fiducials may also be referred to as panel fiducials if used to locate the circuits from the panel datum. Local fiducials are used to locate the position of an individual land pattern or component that may require more precise location, such as a pitch QFP. Board is located by identify global fiducials on the PWB. Then the feeders pick up and center the components at a known distance from the component. Higher placement accuracy requires help from local fiducials visualized by optical or laser sensors. Vacuum pickup head removes components from feeders. In the end, the component is placed at the correct X, Y and theta location with all leads ion the correct pads in contact with solder paste. The PWBs with all components correctly placed will then move to the reflow process. There are three primary attributes that shall be considered in the component placement system: accuracy, speed and flexibility. Accuracy involves the aspects of resolution, placement accuracy and repeatability. Speed involves the aspects of equipment placement rate, de-rating strategy and production through-put. Placement rate is determined by machine type and the distance between components on a board. Flexibility involves the aspects of component variety, number of feeders and PCB size range.  Types of pick and placement machines  A pick and placement machine is a robotic style machine that places some variety of types of components. It includes features such as: component pickup feeder locations, vacuum pickup, vision system, automatic component realignment, repeatable placement accuracy, and transportation system for PCBs. The pick and place machine is often the most important piece of manufacturing equipment for placing components reliably and accurately enough to meet throughput requirements in a cost-effective manner. Typically, surface mount pick and place equipment, including a full complement of feeders constitute about 50% of the total capital investment required for a medium volume surface mount manufacturing line. There are two major types of pick and placement machine: = Chip shooter = Chip shooters are being used for as much as 90% of the most common components, like passives and small actives. Chip shooters are fast (20,000 to 80,000 per hour, can be as fast as 100,000 per hour) with a relatively low accuracy (generally 70 Œºm). As a result, chip shooters are not used for placing active components, which require better accuracy. There are three major types of chip shooters: stationary turret, overhead gentry, and revolver head. = Flexible placer = Comparing to chip shooters, flexible placers are slow (6,000 to 40,000 per hour) with a high accuracy (as low as 25 Œºm). As a result, flexible placers are being used to place complex and high I/O active components like QFPs as higher performance I/O components generally require higher accuracy. There are three major types of flexible placer: overhead gentry, revolver head and split-axis. Chip shooters and flexible placers are typically combined to use and they can take account of nearly 65% of the total assembly line cost.  Types of placement heads  = Overhead gantry = Overhead gantry-style positioning system's placement head is mounted on a gantry beam (X-axis). During the sequence, the beam moves perpendicular to the direction of the placement head movement, which offers two degrees of freedom (X and Y alignment) in a plane parallel to the machine table. The PCB and feeders keep stationary during placement. The PCB is located on the table by identifying global and local fiducials through a vision system. This placement head moves along the axis beams to pick components from a feeder, and then moves into position to place the components. A vacuum nozzle on the placement head moves up and down vertically to provide Z-axis and rotates in the horizontal plane to provide theta angular alignment. Sometimes a secondary vision system is also applied to check the correctness and alignment of the components after pick-up and before placement. As the PCB and feeders remain stationary in the placement sequence, the additional sources of positional inaccuracy are eliminated. Overhead gantry-style machine has the best placement accuracy among all types and is utilized by flexible placers exclusively. It offers greater flexibility and accuracy, but cannot match the speeds of other styles. Machines with multiple gantries can achieve faster speed. = Stationary turret/fixed turret = Stationary turret system has a relatively higher speed due to a series of identical heads rotating on a single turret. The feeder moves in the X direction to a fixed pickup location. As many as 36 vacuum nozzles around the perimeter of the rotating turret provide Z and theta alignment. Turret rotates multiple heads between pickup and placement locations. The PCB moves in X and Y direction under the rotating heads, pausing beneath the correct placement location. Comparing to a gantry head, the simultaneous movements of feeders and PCBs greatly improve the average placement rate. Because passive components do not demand a great placement accuracy, it is exclusively applied in chip shooters. Stationary turret system has a limitation of requiring large footprint for the moving feeder bank (footprint =2*total feeder length). The possibility of dislodging components due to the moving board mechanism is another limitation. = Revolver head = This system combines the speed advantage of stationary turret and the footprint advantage of overhead gantry. It was first being used by Siemens. The stationary turret with multiple pickup heads performs simultaneous functions while moving components from pickup to placement locations. Multiple revolvers are mounted on independent gantries to pick multiple parts from stationary feeders before moving to the PWB. The moving turret and multiple turrets offer higher placement speed and make revolver head can be used in both chip shooters and flexible placers. But utilizing it in flexible placers had limited success in reality. = Split- axis = In a split-axis system, the placement head moves in the X, theta and Z directions, while the PWB moves in the Y direction. As two moving components are involved, split-axis machine slightly more difficult to achieve high accuracy comparing to the overhead gantry machine. But it greatly improves placement speed.  Vacuum nozzle and grippers  Vacuum nozzles are commonly used for handling all the components during the placement operations. There are a variety of vacuum nozzle sizes for different component sizes. For handling small components, positive pressure is often supplied in addition to vacuum at the moment of placement so that the component would be completely release from the nozzle. In addition to vacuum nozzles, mechanical grippers could be required for handling of some odd-shaped parts. Self-centering mechanical grippers allow simultaneous pickup and automatic centering without the need for a vacuum. A pair of tweezers-type grippers would hold the part while centering it along one axis. However, there are some disadvantages with self-centering mechanical grippers: it is possible that the gripper edges could have contact with epoxy or solder paste. In addition, extra space is required between the components to accommodate the grippers.  Types of feeders  Feeders are used to feed components to the moveable pick-up mechanism of placement machines. Feeders move individual components to a fixed location and also assist the pickup head in removing components from their packaging. As the flexibility and placement rate of systems has increased, so have the demands made on the component feeder systems. A high product mix and correspondingly small batch sizes result in frequent feeder changing. Quick feeder changeover is required in order to minimize machine down-time, so feeders must be designed for fast replacement. Here are some of the common types of feeders. = Tape and reel feeders = Tape and reel feeder is the most commonly used feeder design. Tape-on-reel feeders are loaded with a reel, which is placed onto a reel-reception. The peel-off carriage pulls the reel tape forward until the next component is in the pick-up position. When the sensor indicates that the component is at the pickup position, a holder moves down and locks-down the tape. Tape feeders are most suitable for placing large quantities of identical small components. Tape feeders come in a variety of sizes and can be used for Small-outline integrated circuits (SOICs) and plastic leaded chip carriers (PLCCs). The main disadvantage of the tape format is the inability to recycle the empty tapes. Especially in the case of small chip devices, the tape waste material weighs several times more than the packaged components. Moreover, there is additional cost for placing small inexpensive components in tape. = Stick feeders = Stick feeders are designed for components packed in linear sticks (small ICs issued in low volumes). Components are moved to the pick-up location by gravity or vibration. It feeds any ordinary SOP, SOT and PLCC which are packaged in stick form. Due to the various possibilities of adjusting the size of the lane, the feeder can easily be adapted to many different component types. = Matrix tray feeders = Matrix tray feeders are used for large, delicate or expensive components. They are developed out of the necessity for handling quad flat packs and fine pitch components. These hold the components securely without damaging the fragile leads. An entire matrix-profiled tray of components are moved to bring rows or individual components to pick-up location. This process is often slower compared to tape feeders as the components fed in matrix trays often require higher level of placement accuracy. = Bulk feeders = Bulk feeders can handle chip style components that are used in large numbers. A bulk feeder usually dispenses components, which are stored in a bulk case, using a unique rotary positioning mechanism to position and orient components and feed them to the pick-up position using a stainless steel belt. They are cheaper compared with tape feeders as there are no tape packing, but traditionally the performance of bulk feeders is problematic because of construction and debris created during the feeding process. = Direct die feeder = The direct die feeders are mostly used for flip-chip or chip-on board. Direct die feeder could eliminate separate and dedicated production lines for SMT, bare die, and flip chip by combining them into one. It could also enabling total assembly solutions with much higher speed and flexibility, resulting in lower cost per placement. In addition, it could eliminate costly processes such as intermediate die transfer into pocketed tape, surf-tape, or waffle packs prior to placement.  Placement speed  The placement speed is influenced by many factors in the placement process. = Feeder breakdown = The placement speed is affected by the line downtime. Since feeder problems are the a major source of downtime, the repair and maintenance of feeders are crucial for the component placement operations. Here are the common ways to detect feeder problems: * The feeder doesn't achieve the desired output or the output drops after being at the desired level. The feeder has low or reduced output. * The feeder operates noisily only during certain periods. * The feeder operates but has reduced output. * The feeder operates noisily but achieves normal output. * The feeder's amplitude gradually fades or slowly decreases. * The flow of material discharging from the feeder is turbulent, creating inconsistent flow to the process. * The feeder output is inconsistent, creating feed rate fluctuations. = Placement system set up = All on-line setup reduces the capacity and improper setup procedures could also create additional line downtime. No boards could be produced if the placement system is not set up. Due to the complexity of the feeder set up and changeover process, it is important for operators to be aware of the variety types of feeder mechanisms. There are additional tools that could be implemented to assist the placement set up, such as roll-up feeder carts, just-in-time (JIT) methods and smart feeders. = Placement speed derating = In practice it is not possible to obtain the quoted theoretical maximum throughput rate for machines in a placement system. It is necessary to derate the theoretical numbers to obtain realistic values, due to unexpected downtime, board load and unload time and machine configuration. Other factors include PWB size, component mix, and the requirement for more complex vision recognition for fine-pitch components. There are many techniques of derating. Global derating considers system-wide stops, slow-downs and set ups as well as machine factors. To calculate the amount of global or system derating, one should take the average of the number of total components placed per hour in a long period (i.e. an entire product shift). Regularly scheduled stops should be included when determining the level of global derating the system requires. Rigorous derating, which considers each piece of equipment in service for a particular product individually, must be conducted by specific machine model for the line balancing. Rigorous derating values are necessary for full optimization of the process.

The most common adverse reaction is nausea. Severe adverse reactions included elevations in liver enzymes among participants also infected with hepatitis B or C virus, and changes in the immune system (immune reconstitution syndrome). Fostemsavir is an HIV entry inhibitor and a prodrug of temsavir (BMS-626529). Fostemsavir is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120-directed attachment inhibitor. It was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2020.  Medical uses  Fostemsavir in combination with other antiretroviral(s), is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced adults with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection failing their current antiretroviral regimen due to resistance, intolerance, or safety considerations.  Adverse effects  Fostemsavir may cause a serious condition called immune reconstitution syndrome, similar to other approved drugs for treatment of HIV-1 infection. This condition can happen at the beginning of HIV-1 treatment when the immune system may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in the body for a long time. Other serious side effects include heart rhythm problems due to prolongation of heart electrical activity (QT prolongation) and an increase of liver enzymes in patients with hepatitis B or C virus co-infection.  History  It was under development by ViiV Healthcare / GlaxoSmithKline for use in the treatment of HIV infection. By blocking the gp120 receptor of the virus, it prevents initial viral attachment to the host CD4+ T cell and entry into the host immune cell; its method of action is a first for HIV drugs.HIV Attachment Inhibitor BMS-663068 Looks Good in Early Studies Because it targets a different step of the viral lifecycle, it offers promise for individuals with virus that has become highly resistant to other HIV drugs.HIV attachment inhibitor BMS-663068 shows good safety and efficacy in phase 2b study Since gp120 is a highly conserved area of the virus, the drug is unlikely to promote resistance to itself.Activity of the HIV-1 attachment inhibitor BMS-626529, the active component of the prodrug BMS-663068, against CD4-independent viruses and HIV-1 envelopes resistant to other entry inhibitors Investigators found that enfuvirtide-resistant and ibalizumab-resistant HIV envelopes remained susceptible to Fostemsavir. Conversely, Fostemsavir-resistant HIV remained susceptible to all the entry inhibitors. Furthermore, HIV isolates that do not require the CD4 receptor for cell entry were also susceptible to Fostemsavir, and the virus did not escape the attachment inhibitor by becoming CD4-independent. Prior in vitro studies showed that Fostemsavir inhibits both CCR5-tropic and CXCR4-tropic HIV. Temsavir (BMS-626529) Fostemsavir was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2020. The safety and efficacy of fostemsavir, taken twice daily by mouth, were evaluated in a clinical trial of 371 heavily treatment-experienced adult participants who continued to have high levels of virus (HIV-RNA) in their blood despite being on antiretroviral drugs. Two hundred seventy-two participants were treated in the main trial arm, and an additional 99 participants received fostemsavir in a different arm of the trial. Most participants had been treated for HIV for more than 15 years (71 percent), had been exposed to five or more different HIV treatment regimens before entering the trial (85 percent) and/or had a history of AIDS (86 percent). Participants in the main cohort of the trial received either fostemsavir or a placebo twice daily for eight days, in addition to their failing antiretroviral regimen. On the eighth day, participants treated with fostemsavir had a significantly greater decrease in levels of HIV-RNA in their blood compared to those taking the placebo. After the eighth day, all participants received fostemsavir with other antiretroviral drugs. After 24 weeks of fostemsavir plus other antiretroviral drugs, 53 percent of participants achieved HIV RNA suppression, where levels of HIV were low enough to be considered undetectable. After 96 weeks, 60 percent of participants continued to have HIV RNA suppression. The clinical trial (NCT02362503) was conducted at 108 sites in 23 countries in North America, South America, Europe, Australia, Taiwan and South Africa. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for fostemsavir fast track, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designations. The FDA granted the approval of Rukobia to ViiV Healthcare.

Background After the conclusion of the Northern Seven Years' War, Polish-Lithuanian and Swedish privateers continued to attack merchant vessels which traded with Tsardom of Russia via the port of Narva. Both the Polish-Lithuanians and the Swedes refrained from direct attacks on Dano-Norwegian fleet, while Denmark regarded all such raids as piracy. Under the circumstances, Copenhagen decided to undertake activities directed against the Commonwealth. Battle In July 1571, a squadron of eighteen Danish ships under a Danish admiral, Franke, entered the waters of the Gda≈Ñsk Bay.

Funding The group received funding from sources in Saudi Arabia. By 2013, it required 2 million Turkish liras (equivalent of $568,456.42) daily to operate. The group also stole money and looted from warehouses in the al-Layramoun district of Aleppo and Kafr Hamrah. It also conducted kidnapping for large amounts of ransom. History The group was originally formed as the Free Anadan Brigade by Ahmad Afash, a rebel from the Khalidiya district of Aleppo. It fielded 500 fighters by mid-2012 and took part in the Battle of Anadan in July 2012. After the battle, the group captured several tanks from the Syrian Army and gained influence as well as additional fighters, and changed its name to the Free Syria Brigade, or Liwa Ahrar Souriya. In late October 2012, amid infighting between the People's Protection Units and other rebel groups in Aleppo, the Free Syria Brigade abducted 120 Kurdish civilians in the area. After negotiations between the Democratic Union Party and FSA groups, they were released. In December 2012 the group signed a declaration that rejected the authority of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces and proposed to establish an Islamic state, although its leader later withdrew from the declaration and recognized the National Coalition. In September 2013, the Free Syria Brigade became a founding member group of the 16th Division. Another group in the 16th Division was the Badr Martyrs Brigade, led by Khaled Hayani. Tensions brewed between Hayani and Ahmad Afash after the Badr Martyrs Brigade clashed with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in October 2013. The Free Syria Brigade left the 16th Division in November 2013 and redeployed its fighters away from the frontlines with ISIL and toward the frontlines against the Syrian Army. The group was known to be corrupt. Among other things he did to receive money, Ahmad Afash confiscated alcohol to sell them to merchants outside Aleppo. During this time, he also acquired a Mercedes-Benz S-Class. At the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014, infighting between ISIL and other rebel groups escalated in northern Syria. During the infighting, Ahmad Afash fled to Turkey and rented a hotel in Mersin. During his stay in Turkey, Afash became a drug addict and was once hospitalized. Meanwhile, in Syria, the Free Syria Brigade held out in Aleppo and its surrounding areas. On 19 May 2014, the Free Syria Brigade and the al-Nusra Front detonated a tunnel bomb in the Ancient City of Aleppo which destroyed a historic palace, which at the time was used by the Syrian Army as a military headquarter. In October 2015, during the Russian military intervention in Syria, the Free Syria Brigade headquarters in the northern Aleppo Governorate was hit by a Russian airstrike which killed 7 of its fighters. Since November 2015, the group has participated in the shelling of Aleppo's Sheikh Maqsood neighborhood, controlled by the People's Protection Units as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces. In September 2016, the Free Syria Brigade joined the Hamza Division. 2 months later, on 15 November 2016, it left the Hamza Division and joined the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement's north Aleppo branch, whom they in turned joined the Sham Legion's north Aleppo branch. They in turn dissolved to form the Revolutionary Knights Brigade, which is a part of the Northern Brigade that left the Sham Legion on 30 May 2017, though their current membership is unclear, and it is also unclear if they are still active.

She studies how network structure influences the flow of information, how information influences the evolution of networks, and crowdsourced knowledge sharing. Adamic is a director of research at Facebook, where she leads a computational social science team. She was previously an associate professor at the University of Michigan until. Previously she worked in Hewlett-Packard's Information Dynamics Lab on research projects relating to network constructed from large data sets.  Education  From 1990 Adamic attended Stuyvesant High School, one of the nine specialized high schools in New York City, where she was a member of mathematics team, which is the additional course for those who are interested in more advanced problem solving techniques. She moved with her family in 1992 and attended Fairview High School, ranked in the top ten in the United States. In 1993‚Äì1997 Adamic received her bachelor's degree in physics, engineering and applied science at California Institute of Technology and then got her PhD degree in applied physics at Stanford University in 2001. In 1994‚Äì1995 she was undergraduate research assistant at Caltech working on designing an electrostatic solar wind concentrator for the Genesis mission. In 1996‚Äì1997 she worked on the project of materials deposition with pulsed laser ablation. While writing her PhD thesis named \\"Network Dynamics: The World Wide Web\\" at Stanford she also worked with Xerox PARC researchers and modeled growth and search processes of the Internet.  Academic career  Adamic worked for four years in Hewlett Packard labs as a research scientist where she studied networks created from large data sets, such as studying medical literature for gene-disease connections and modelling search processes on real-world social networks. In 2005 Adamic left HP Labs for the University of Michigan. She took a sabbatical in 2013 to join Facebook's data scientist team, where she stayed. Adamic is an editor for information science at the Network Science journal. Since April 2013, the journal publishes 3 issues per year. Adamic taught an online course \\"Social Network Analysis\\" on Coursera.  Research and achievements  Adamic's research is focused on analysing virtual world and social networks in particular. Together with Eytan Adar she holds U.S. patent 07162522 on User profile classification by web usage analysis. The method allows to predict user attributes (demographic information) based on an analysis of accessed web pages. While working on her PhD, Adamic obtained another U.S. patent 6631451 and 6415368: System and method for caching. It uses quality or value attributes, provided by a recommender system or by thorough analysis of site accesses that are attached to cached information to prioritize items in the cache and to identify higher value information. These methods aid in analysing networks. Adamic studies different aspects of online networks. For instance, using graph and text mining techniques together with her colleagues, she analyzed the usage patterns of Twitter during the House, Senate and gubernatorial midterm elections in the U.S. in 2010. They found significant relationships between content and election results, which is why more detailed analysis of several campaigns could be useful to predict which Twitter campaigns are the most effective. The analysis of cultural differences when using social networks can be useful for the developers of the social networks. Adamic together with her colleagues is exploring these differences. In one of her papers she tries to find the differences between usage of Q & A tools in social networks across two Western (United States and United Kingdom) and two Eastern cultures (China and India). It turned out that Eastern users tend to write serious professional networking questions, whereas Western users post questions just for fun. These differences are important for designing social networks for specific cultures. Studying how family members communicate on Facebook revealed that the interaction on Facebook doesn't decrease with the distance, which means that in the U.S. Facebook is a very important tool for parents/grandparents to communicate with their children/grandchildren. The results of the paper are actually very important and can be used to prioritize news stories, recommend friend connections with other relatives or automatically generate lists for privacy settings. In her paper about rating friends on Facebook, Dr. Adamic and her co-authors suggest the way to improve Facebook system of ranking friends to avoid awkward situations when friends rated one another differently. Particularly they suggest to use an alternative, anonymous feedback system. The other question which interests Adamic is information diffusion through social networks. After studying 253 million subjects on Facebook, they found that weak ties are more influential than strong ties. Tie strength is determined by how often individuals communicate with each other through private messaging, replying to the same comments, or the number of real-world communication captured by Facebook. There is no doubt that mass adoption of online social networks lead to high information flow and high availability of this information for the individuals. However, it turned out that in transmitting important information such as new job vacancies or future plans weak ties have an advantage compared to the strong ties, because they have fewer mutual contacts, this is why every person has access to the information to which the other person does not.  Awards  Adamic has received National Science Foundation Career Award to fund her research on the social dynamics of information and University of Michigan Henry Russell award in recognition of her teaching and research. In 2012 she got Lagrange Prize in Complex Systems and best paper awards from International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) 2011, International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM) 2011, International Conference on Webblogs and Social Media (ICWSM) 2010, Hypertext 2008.

It is still aspiring to the level of big five fashion weeks (New York City, London, Paris, Milan and Berlin). Based on the concept of the international fashion week series, TONI&GUY; Fashion Week Budapest is an event, where the leading Hungarian fashion designers and international designers gain platform to introduce their seasonal collections twice a year for the Hungarian and international fashion industry and the public as well. The event is usually held in the Palazzo Dorottya.  Location  The Spring-Summer 2019 edition of Budapest Fashion Week was hosted at the V√°rkert Baz√°r in the capital of Budapest. Purpose and organizer Budapest Fashion Week's aim is to get together the talented young fashion designers with the innovative brands for a successful and most ‚Äútalked about‚Äù event for communication and socially responsible purposes. Based on the concept of the international fashion week series, TONI&GUY; Fashion Week Budapest is an event, where the leading Hungarian fashion designers gain platform to introduce their seasonal collections twice a year for the Hungarian and international fashion industry and the public as well. The long-term goal of the event is to build a position for the Hungarian designers on the local and also on the international markets and to revive Hungarian fashion and textile industry. The organizer of this event is BigBag PR Agency, which is a boutique strategic communications firm specializes in fashion and beauty. Based on industry experiences ‚Äì with a background in fashion journalism ‚Äì the agency develop programs that launch, grow, or re-establish brand's presence and deliver consistent brand message. The agency's aim is to reinvigorate the professional Hungarian fashion life, that is why the organizers created TONI&GUY; Fashion Week Budapest. Budapest Fashion Week is not limited to Hungarian designers alone. Labels from other central European countries including Poland, Czech Republic, Romania, and Ukraine are also featured. These designers are working to change the way Budapest fashion is perceived by incorporating unique color palettes, fabrics, and silhouettes. Sandra Sandor has reached a higher popularity status than most other designers featured in Budapest Fashion Week. Sandor developed her brand named Nanushka in 2005, immediately after graduating from the London College of Fashion. Sandor is known for her knit sweaters, satin dresses with tie-waist details, striped linen pants, vegan leather puffers and belt bags. For each collection she chooses a clashing culture theme. For example, her Spring 2018 collection represents a mix of ‚Äúfar Eastern culture and wild Western Americana‚Äù . Nanushka's bold pieces made from luxurious fabrics and sold at a contemporary price point set this brand aside from most. It has gained global recognition, now being sold to Net-a-Porter, MyTheresa, Nordstrom, and Moda Operandi. World-famous fashion models Gigi Hadid and Caroline de Maigret have been caught wearing staple Nanushka pieces. This brand has been featured twice in New York Fashion Week and there are plans to open stores in New York and LA in the coming years. Through Sandor's hard work and increased popularity, she is helping to establish Budapest as the latest fashion hub.  Thoughts from Vogue  On October 31, 2018, Vogue Italia published a review of the Budapest Fashion Week 2018. The article ‚ÄúBudapest Central European Fashion Week SS19‚Äù written by Alberto Calabrese claims that the fashion show lacked organization and direction. At times, this negatively affected the schedule in which each designer's collection was presented. Despite the setbacks, the staff prevailed, giving the viewers an exciting and inspiring show in the end.

It was written by Ray Davies. Lyrics and music Ray Davies said of the song's inspiration: \\"This Time Tomorrow\\", like most of the other tracks on Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One, criticizes the music business. More specifically, the track complains of the monotony of being on the road. The singer, who is currently on a plane, wonders where he'll be \\"this time tomorrow.\\" He fantasizes over what the future holds for him, pondering whether he'll still be on the plane, \\"watching an in-flight movie show\\", and dreaming of being \\"on a spaceship somewhere sailing across an empty sea.\\" He'll \\"leave the sun behind [him] and watch the clouds as they sadly pass [him] by,\\" and says he \\"can see the world and it ain't so big at all.\\" \\"I don't know where I'm going, I don't want to see,\\" the singer laments. \\"This Time Tomorrow\\" opens with the sound of an airplane flying, followed by guitar and a National Steel resonator guitar.

She was known professionally as Madame Carteaux.  Biography  Christiana Carteaux Bannister was born Christiana Babcock in 1819 in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. She was born to African American and Narragansett Indian parents. She was a descendant of enslaved Africans who worked the plantations of South County, Rhode Island, during the eighteenth century. As a young woman, she moved to Boston where she worked as a wigmaker and hairdresser.  Marriage  Her first marriage was to Desiline Carteaux, a clothes dealer. Her marriage to Carteaux, believed to be of Caribbean origin, did not last. In 1853 Christiana and Edward Mitchell Bannister met when he applied for work as a barber in her Boston salon. Her second marriage was to Bannister on June 10, 1857, who became one of the most successful Black artists because of Christiana Carteaux Bannister's financial and emotional support. Edward attributed much of his success to Christiana for her critical eye and her business sense. In 1869 the Bannisters moved to Providence, Rhode Island, and Christiana continued her business as a hairdresser as well as her activism.  Hairdressing business  As a young woman, Christiana moved from Rhode Island to Boston where she began her career as a wigmaker. She was professionally known as Madame Carteaux, Women's Hairdresser and Wigmaker. She was a successful business entrepreneur, and self-styled \\"hair doctress,\\" generating income by hairdressing and selling her own hair products. From 1847 to 1871 Christiana Carteaux Bannister maintained several salons in Boston including Cambridge, Boston, and Winter Streets. When Christiana Carteaux Bannister and Edward Bannister moved to Providence, she opened another salon in Providence.  Abolitionists  Bronze portrait bust State House, Providence, RI, 2002 In Boston, the Bannisters lived and worked with Lewis Hayden and participated in the Boston Underground Railroad. The Bannister hair salons became popular meeting places for African American and white abolitionists.  Other activism  During the Civil War, Christiana Carteaux Bannister was an advocate for equal pay for Black soldiers. In November 1864, she organized a fair sponsored by the Boston Colored Ladies Sanitary Commission to benefit the African American regiments, the 54th and 55th Massachusetts and the 5th Massachusetts Cavalry, who served for a year and a half without pay rather than accept less than the white soldiers were paid. In Providence, she founded the Home for Aged Colored Women when she learned about the struggles of African American women who worked as domestics but were too old to work and often became homeless. The home moved from Transit St. to Dodge St. and was renamed Bannister House, Inc.  Death and legacy  Despite her success throughout her professional life, Bannister died with little money in January 1903. Though she was admitted into the Home for Aged Colored Women in September 1902, Bannister reportedly lived with mental illness and was transferred to the Howard Asylum, Lancaster reported. Upon her death, she was laid to rest next to her husband, who died in January 1901 during a church prayer meeting, without a grave marker. But years after her death, she began to receive more public recognition for her contributions to society and Black history. Bannister was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 2003, and a bronze bust of her, based upon a portrait Edward painted, was placed in the Rhode Island State House in December 2002.

He is a former vice-president of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, and former Interception of Communications Commissioner. Life Kennedy was born in northern England in Sheffield, Yorkshire. He studied at Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire, then at Caius College at Cambridge and received his final law training at Sheffield University. In 1960 Kennedy was admitted to legal practice as a barrister via Gray's Inn, and in 1973 he took silk (became Queen's Counsel). From 1971 to 1983 Kennedy served as the recorder on the North Eastern Circuit. In 1983 he was appointed as a justice of the High Court, assigned to the Queen's Bench Division, where he served until 1992. He was the presiding judge of the North Eastern Circuit from 1985 to 1989. From 1992 to 2005 Kennedy was an appellate judge on the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, known as a Lord Justice of Appeal. From 1997 to 2002 he also served as the vice-president of the Queen's Bench Division. In 2006, Kennedy was appointed as Interception of Communications Commissioner (ICC) by Tony Blair for the standard three-year term. In April 2009, he was reappointed for a second term by Gordon Brown. Kennedy served until December 2012, and was succeeded by Sir Anthony May in January 2013. In 2014, Kennedy served an additional six months as Interception of Communications Commissioner due to the convalescence of Anthony May from an accident.May resumed the commissioner duties on 1 January 2015. Also in 2006 Kennedy was appointed to the Court of Appeal in Gibraltar, where he became president in December 2011. In 2009 he was appointed by the Estimates Committee of the House of Commons to hear appeals from members of parliament (MPs) whose claims for reimbursement and allowances had been denied by the Commons fees office. Controversies In 1995, Kennedy was an advisor to a charity that promoted a controversial, brainwashing style rehabilitation program for young offenders reminiscent of that used in Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, for which he was later taken to task by the press. In 2010, Kennedy on appeal reversed more than 50% of the cases for repayments from MPs that Sir Thomas Legg had demanded. He found that in most cases there was no evidence of wrongdoing, and that it was unfair to call MPs who had not broken the existing rules things such as \\"tainted\\" or having \\"breached the requirements of propriety\\". In 2011, while serving as Interception of Communications Commissioner, Kennedy and the Intelligence Services Commissioner, Sir Mark Waller, were ridiculed for allowing their new web site dealing with state security to have open editing access.

Biography  Imad al-Dawla Muhammad belonged to the Bu Halim Shaybani family; he was the son of a certain Ali, and had a brother named Rabi ibn Ali. The last mentioned member of the Bu Halim before Imad al-Dawla Muhammad was Najm al-Din Zarir, who was the son of Bu Halim, the eponymous founder of the family. Imad al-Dawla Muhammad and his brother are first mentioned during the reign of Sultan Arslan-Shah, where Imad al-Dawla Muhammad is mentioned as the commander-in-chief (sipahsalar) of the Ghaznavid army in India, and his brother Rabi ibn Ali is also mentioned, but his office is unknown. However, Arslan-Shah's reign turned out short; his mother, a Seljuq princess named Gawhar Khatun was treated badly, which resulted in her brother Ahmad Sanjar to invade Arslan-Shah's domains, where he managed to decisively defeat Arslan-Shah and make the latter's brother Bahram-Shah the new ruler of the Ghaznavid dynasty, while at the same time acknowledging Sejluq suzerainty. However, Arslan-Shah managed to survive the invasion, and fled to India, where he was supported by the Bu Halim brothers and other officers. After Ahmad Sanjar left the Ghaznavid capital of Ghazni, Arslan-Shah returned to the capital, where he defeated Bahram-Shah, but Ahmad Sanjar shortly returned and defeated Arslan-Shah, who once again fled, but was captured by a Seljuq commander, and was executed. However, the two Bu Halim brothers kept opposing Bahram-Shah; Imad al-Din Muhammad, who was still in India, managed to withstand an attack by Bahram-Shah, but in the end was defeated and captured at Lahore in 1119 by the latter. However, because of Imad al-Din Muhammad's great service in India to the Ghaznavids, Bahram-Shah pardoned him and restored him as the commander-in-chief of the Ghaznavid army in India. However, Imad al-Din Muhammad, along with several of his sons such as Mu'tasim ibn Muhammad, shortly rebelled against Bahram-Shah, but he along with his sons were killed by an army sent by Bahram-Shah. After this event, mention of the Bu Halim family completely disappears.

In a racing career which lasted from September 1977 until September 1978 she won four of her eight races. As a two-year-old in 1977 she won on her debut before finishing second in the Cheveley Park Stakes. As a three-year-old she finished second in the 1000 Guineas before being moved up in distance and winning the Oaks, Irish Oaks and Yorkshire Oaks. She was retired to stud at the end of the season and had some influence as a broodmare. She died in 2004 at the age of twenty-nine. Background Fair Salinia was a bay mare with a small white star and white socks on her hind legs bred in Ireland by Major John de Brugh's Oldtown Stud. She was sired by Petingo, the leading English two-year-old of 1967 when he was rated the best horse in Europe by the independent Timeform organisation. His other progeny included the 1979 Derby winner Troy. Fair Salinia's dam, Fair Arabella was an American-bred mare who was a half-sister to the Prix du Moulin winner Faraway Son and the Prix d'Harcourt winner Liloy. As a descendant of the broodmare Judy O'Grady, Fair Arabella came from the same branch of Thoroughbred family 16-c which also produced Green Dancer, Solemia, Authorized, Dream Well and Makfi. As a yearling, Fair Salinia was offered for sale and bought by Sven Hanson for 13,000 guineas. Hanson later explained had not intended to spend more than 7,000 guineas and was looking to buy only colts, but decided to bid for the filly as she was \\"the spitting image of Liloy\\". The filly, who was named in honour of the Hanson family's interests in the salt business, was sent into training with Michael Stoute at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1977: two-year-old season= Fair Salinia made her racecourse debut in early September 1977 when she contested the Gancia Stakes over seven furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse for which started a 20/1 outsider. The race was open to both colts and fillies but was restricted to horses that had not run before 3 August. Fair Salinia took the lead on the turn into the straight, went clear of the field approaching the final furlong and won by two lengths from the colt Tom Noel. At the end of the month the filly was moved up sharply in class for the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. She appeared outpaced for most of the race but stayed on strongly in the closing stages to finish third behind Sookera and Petty Purse. Following inquiry by the racecourse stewards she was promoted to second after Petty Purse was disqualified for causing interference. =1978: three-year-old season= Fair Salinia ran disappointingly on her three-year-old debut, finishing fourth behind Shapina in the Fred Darling Stakes. She then contested the classic 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket in which she produced a much better performance, finishing strongly to take second place in a field of sixteen fillies, a length behind Enstone Spark. A month later, Fair Salinia was moved up in distance for the 200th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Some observers doubted that she would stay the distance, as most of her family had excelled as milers. Ridden by Greville Starkey, she started at odds of 8/1 in a field of fifteen fillies, with the French-trained Dancing Maid starting favourite after having won the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches. Fair Salinia had a good position throughout the race and tracked Dancing Maid when the French filly went to the front a quarter of a mile from the finish. Under a strong ride from Starkey, Fair Salinia moved alongside the favourite and went gained the advantage in the final stride to win by a short head. Stoute was winning the race for the first time, whilst Starkey completed a notable double, having won the Derby on Shirley Heights three days earlier. At the Curragh Racecourse on 15 July, Fair Salinia started 3/1 favourite for the Irish Oaks. She turned into the straight in fifth place and made steady headway to move into second place behind the John Oxx-trained filly Sorbus a furlong from the finish. She could make no further progress, however, and finished second, beaten a length by Sorbus who had hung to the left in the closing stages, with the Ribblesdale Stakes winner Relfo close behind in third place. Following an objection by Starkey and an inquiry by the local stewards Sorbus was disqualified for causing interference to the runner-up in the final furlong and the race was awarded to Fair Salinia. Timeform felt that Fair Salinia was lucky to be awarded the race, whilst Oxx, who lodged an unsuccessful appeal against the verdict later referred to \\"that infamous day\\". Fair Salina and Sorbus met again in the Yorkshire Oaks at York Racecourse in August. Relfo started favourite at odds of 7/4 ahead of Sorbus (4/1) with Fair Salinia third choice in the betting on 5/1. In a change of tactics, Starkey sent the filly into the lead six furlongs from the finish and sent her clear of the field early in the straight. She appeared to be tiring in the closing stages but held on to win by one and a half lengths from Sorbus, with Be Sweet in third. In the following month, Fair Salinia was sent to France to contest the Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 17 September in which she was opposed by Dancing Maid and Relfo. Starting at odds of 13/1 she led from the start and set a very strong pace but was overtaken in the straight and finished fifth, three and a half lengths behind the winner Dancing Maid. Assessment As a two-year-old, Fair Salinia was given a rating of 114 by Timeform, eleven pounds below their top-rated two-year-old filly Cherry Hinton. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the best two-year-olds to race in Britain, she was allotted a weight of 120 pounds, seven pounds behind Cherry Hinton, making her the fourth highest-rated filly of her generation. In the following year, she was given a rating of 125 by Timeform, four pounds behind their top-rated three-year-old filly Swiss Maid. She was rated eleven pounds behind the same filly in the official International Classification. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Fair Salinia an \\"average\\" winner of the Oaks.

There are three fundamental approaches to constructing measures of network similarity: structural equivalence, automorphic equivalence, and regular equivalence.Newman, M.E.J. 2010. Networks: An Introduction. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. There is a hierarchy of the three equivalence concepts: any set of structural equivalences are also automorphic and regular equivalences. Any set of automorphic equivalences are also regular equivalences. Not all regular equivalences are necessarily automorphic or structural; and not all automorphic equivalences are necessarily structural.  Visualizing similarity and distance  = Clustering tools = Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering of nodes on the basis of the similarity of their profiles of ties to other nodes provides a joining tree or Dendrogram that visualizes the degree of similarity among cases - and can be used to find approximate equivalence classes.Hanneman, Robert A. and Mark Riddle. 2005. Introduction to social network methods. Riverside, CA: University of California, Riverside ( published in digital form at http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/ ) = Multi- dimensional scaling tools = Usually our goal in equivalence analysis is to identify and visualize \\"classes\\" or clusters of cases. In using cluster analysis, we are implicitly assuming that the similarity or distance among cases reflects as single underlying dimension. It is possible, however, that there are multiple \\"aspects\\" or \\"dimensions\\" underlying the observed similarities of cases. Factor or components analysis could be applied to correlations or covariances among cases. Alternatively, multi-dimensional scaling could be used (non-metric for data that are inherently nominal or ordinal; metric for valued). MDS represents the patterns of similarity or dissimilarity in the tie profiles among the actors (when applied to adjacency or distances) as a \\"map\\" in multi-dimensional space. This map lets us see how \\"close\\" actors are, whether they \\"cluster\\" in multi-dimensional space, and how much variation there is along each dimension.  Structural equivalence  Two vertices of a network are structurally equivalent if they share many of the same neighbors. Structural equivalence There is no actor who has exactly the same set of ties as actor A, so actor A is in a class by itself. The same is true for actors B, C, D and G. Each of these nodes has a unique set of edges to other nodes. E and F, however, fall in the same structural equivalence class. Each has only one edge; and that tie is to B. Since E and F have exactly the same pattern of edges with all the vertices, they are structurally equivalent. The same is true in the case of H and I. Structural equivalence is the strongest form of similarity. In many real networks exact equivalence may be rare, and it could be useful to ease the criteria and measure approximate equivalence. A closely related concept is institutional equivalence: two actors (e.g., firms) are institutionally equivalent if they operate in the same set of institutional fields. While structurally equivalent actors have identical relational patterns or network positions, institutional equivalence captures the similarity of institutional influences that actors experience from being in the same fields, regardless of how similar their network positions are. For example, two banks in Chicago might have very different patterns of ties (e.g., one may be a central node, and the other may be in a peripheral position) such that they are not structural equivalents, but because they both operate in the field of finance and banking and in the same geographically defined field (Chicago), they will be subject to some of the same institutional influences. = Measures for structural equivalence =  Cosine similarity  A simple count of common neighbors for two vertices is not on its own a very good measure. One should know the degree of the vertices or how many common neighbors other pairs of vertices has. Cosine similarity takes into account these regards and also allow for the varying degrees of vertices. Salton proposed that we regard the i-th and j-th rows/columns of the adjacency matrix as two vectors and use the cosine of the angle between them as a similarity measure. The cosine similarity of i and j is the number of common neighbors divided by the geometric mean of their degrees.Salton G., Automatic Text Processing: The Transformation, Analysis and Retrieval of Information by Computer, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1989) Its value lies in the range from 0 to 1. The value of 1 indicates that the two vertices have exactly the same neighbors while the value of zero means that they do not have any common neighbors. Cosine similarity is technically undefined if one or both of the nodes has zero degree, but according to the convention we say that cosine similarity is 0 in these cases.  Pearson coefficient  Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is an alternative method to normalize the count of common neighbors. This method compares the number of common neighbors with the expected value that count would take in a network where vertices are connected randomly. This quantity lies strictly in the range from -1 to 1.  Euclidean distance  Euclidean distance is equal to the number of neighbors that differ between two vertices. It is rather a dissimilarity measure, since it is larger for vertices which differ more. It could be normalized by dividing by its maximum value. The maximum means that there are no common neighbors, in which case the distance is equal to the sum of the degrees of the vertices.  Automorphic equivalence  Formally \\"Two vertices are automorphically equivalent if all the vertices can be re-labeled to form an isomorphic graph with the labels of u and v interchanged. Two automorphically equivalent vertices share exactly the same label-independent properties.\\"Borgatti, Steven, Martin Everett, and Linton Freeman. 1992. UCINET IV Version 1.0 User's Guide. Columbia, SC: Analytic Technologies. More intuitively, actors are automorphically equivalent if we can permute the graph in such a way that exchanging the two actors has no effect on the distances among all actors in the graph. Automorphic equivalence Suppose the graph describes the organizational structure of a company. Actor A is the central headquarter, actors B, C, and D are managers. Actors E, F and H, I are workers at smaller stores; G is the lone worker at another store. Even though actor B and actor D are not structurally equivalent (they do have the same boss, but not the same workers), they do seem to be \\"equivalent\\" in a different sense. Both manager B and D has a boss (in this case, the same boss), and each has two workers. If we swapped them, and also swapped the four workers, all of the distances among all the actors in the network would be exactly identical. There are actually five automorphic equivalence classes: {A}, {B, D}, {C}, {E, F, H, I}, and {G}. Note that the less strict definition of \\"equivalence\\" has reduced the number of classes.  Regular equivalence  Formally, \\"Two actors are regularly equivalent if they are equally related to equivalent others.\\" In other words, regularly equivalent vertices are vertices that, while they do not necessarily share neighbors, have neighbors who are themselves similar. Two mothers, for example, are equivalent, because each has a similar pattern of connections with a husband, children, etc. The two mothers do not have ties to the same husband or the same children, so they are not structurally equivalent. Because different mothers may have different numbers of husbands and children, they will not be automorphically equivalent. But they are similar because they have the same relationships with some member or members of another set of actors (who are themselves regarded as equivalent because of the similarity of their ties to a member of the set \\"mother\\"). Regular equivalence In the graph there are three regular equivalence classes. The first is actor A; the second is composed of the three actors B, C, and D; the third consists of the remaining five actors E, F, G, H, and I. The easiest class to see is the five actors across the bottom of the diagram (E, F, G, H, and I). These actors are regularly equivalent to one another because: # they have no tie with any actor in the first class (that is, with actor A) and # each has a tie with an actor in the second class (either B or C or D). Each of the five actors, then, has an identical pattern of ties with actors in the other classes. Actors B, C, and D form a class similarly. B and D actually have ties with two members of the third class, whereas actor C has a tie to only one member of the third class, but this doesn't matter, as there is a tie to some member of the third class. Actor A is in a class by itself, defined by: # a tie to at least one member of class two and # no tie to any member of class three.

It was built in 1551 probably in Flanders and, at 37 years old, was one of the oldest ships in the Armada (√òdegaard 2001: 13, Martin & Parker 1999: 26). Santiago was an urca (hulk), a type of ship used to carry goods between northern Europe and southern Europe. Spanish authorities seized Santiago in 1587 while it lay in port in Sanl√∫car de Barrameda and pressed it into service for the Armada‚Äôs planned invasion of England (√òdegaard 2001: 13). Santiago carried a variety of supplies and armament. These included 24 artillery mules, gunpowder, musket balls, horseshoes, horseshoe nails, hinges, wagon rods, barrel bands, iron plates, lead bar, and hardtack (√òdegaard 2001: 30,34,74). Santiago was equipped with 19 canons (√òdegaard 2001: 14, Martin & Parker 1999: 264). Santiago had 116 people on board when it sailed with the rest of the Armada from La Coru√±a out into the English Channel to engage the English fleet in July 1588 (√òdegaard 2001: 15, Martin & Parker 1999: xix). The crew consisted of 33 sailors and officers (civilians), 16 stable boys, 3 artillerists, 32 Spanish soldiers, and 32 women who were the wives of the 32 Spanish soldiers. This unusual arrangement (carrying soldiers‚Äô wives) earned Santiago the moniker \\"ship of the women\\" (Martin & Parker 1999: 26,264). Four people had responsibility for the ship and people on board (√òdegaard 2001: 26,29). The captain was Nicol√°n de Juan of Aragon. The skipper was Simon Unique. Alonso de Olmos had command of the Spanish soldiers. Diego de la Nava had command of the men who operated the artillery and cared for the mules. After losing a series of battles with the English fleet, the Armada escaped by sailing north between England and Norway (Martin & Parker 1999: 211). They planned to sail around the north end of the British Isles, out into the Atlantic Ocean, then south to Spain. Many ships began to fall behind (Martin & Parker 1999: 211, √òdegaard 2001: 29). In very bad weather with a strong headwind, running short of supplies, and leaking, Santiago finally turned east and ran with the wind toward Norway (√òdegaard 2001: 29). They made landfall on 18 September 1588 near Skudeneshavn (√òdegaard 2001: 34) and picked up a local man who agreed to guide them north to Bergen. As they sailed up the coast, they encountered another strong storm. Leaking badly, they turned into Hardanger Fjord and wrecked near Mosterhamn (√òdegaard 2001: 34). Everyone survived the wreck (√òdegaard 2001: 34). After a few months stay at several locations in the Bergen area, most of the crew sailed on a German ship toward Hamburg but wrecked again near Halmstad, Sweden (√òdegaard 2001: 19). They then traveled mostly overland to Buxtehude, a town near Hamburg, where they asked to be released to find their own way home (√òdegaard 2001: 39). References *Martin, C. & Parker, G. (1999).

Since 1976 it has been a minimum security prison for young male adults, recently called Hudson Correctional Facility.Directive of New York state It is famous for the sociometric research done by Jacob Moreno in the 1930s.

Lyon Co, 1904, p.3 The institute took the place and the buildings of the former House of Refuge for Women. It was located on the east side of the Hudson River, with a \\"famous view\\"New York State Training School for Girls at Hudson, Albany : J.B. Lyon Co, 1904, p.5 of the Catskill mountains. In the beginning there were seven, three-story, well-established cottages for 26 girls on average, several sport fields, office buildings and a chapel. The institution was led by a superintendent and each cottage had a teacher and a few officers. The teacher, or \\"house mother\\" played the part of the parents, and officials such as kitchen officials were responsible for leading the activity of the girls. Methods of reformation =Early years = The official aim of the institution was to develop healthy bodily and mental activities in order to make their inmates more likely to \\"do well after leaving the institution\\".New York State Training School for Girls at Hudson, Albany : J.B. Lyon Co, 1904, p.11 The \\"reformation\\" was based on three pillars. # Physical culture: personalized calisthenics and gymnastics training # Education: four grades of elementary school, introduction to housework, like cooking, ironing, laundry, dressmaking and gardening. # Moral and religious introduction: \\"The moral instruction is enforced by practice and example rather than by precept\\".New York State Training School for Girls at Hudson, Albany : J.B. Lyon Co, 1904, p.11 Corporal punishment was strictly prohibited. =The '30s - Moreno and the sociometry= In 1932 there was a pandemic of runaways at the institution: within two weeks 14 girls ran away, which was 30 times more than the average number.Stephen P. Borgatti, Ajay Mehra, Daniel J. Brass, and Giuseppe Labianca. Network Analysis in the Social Sciences. Science.13 February 2009. At that time the reformatory consisted of 16 cottages. The supreme superintendent, Fannie French Morse had heard of Jacob Moreno's idea of mapping up societies with natural scientific methodsStephen P. Borgatti, Ajay Mehra, Daniel J. Brass, and Giuseppe Labianca. Network Analysis in the Social Sciences. Science.13 February 2009. and she had also heard of his successes in the Sing Sing prison. After the first meeting she hired Moreno to be the Research Director of the institute. Prison Public Memory blog: The \\"Ungovernable\\" Ella Fitzgerald by Russ Immarigeon Moreno and his assistant Helen H. Jennings examined 500 girls, their intelligence, social activities and most importantly, their feelings towards each other. Using the method of sociometry he visualized these connections in several sociograms. The earned experiences and the graphs were published in his seminal book Who shall survive?. As a conclusion he distilled that behind social phenomena there is an inexplicable driving force which is due to the structure of the relationships between individuals. It was true for the girls from Hudson: the runaway reactions were not conscious, rather they behaved how their location in the social network forced them to.Stephen P. Borgatti, Ajay Mehra, Daniel J.

Career As a young man, Boehm served as an innkeeper in the town of Lambsheim, where he became a citizen in 1706. Two years later, in 1708, he became the Reformed school teacher in the city of Worms,‚ÄúCalvinistic Character of the Early German Reformed Church‚Äù. Reformed Church of the U.S. (RCUS). April 9th, 2009. Retrieved May 22, 2014. a position which he occupied until 1715. In 1720, Boehm immigrated to ‚ÄúPenn‚Äôs Woods‚Äù in eastern Pennsylvania. Because of a lack of Reformed ministers, many German Reformed immigrants who found him to be both educated and pious asked him to read sermons to them. Eventually, in 1725, communities in Falkner Swamp, Skippack Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania and White Marsh Pennsylvania called him to be their pastor, a call which he was reluctant to take, due to the fact that he was not ordained, as having a non-ordained minister administer the sacraments. On October 15, 1725, Boehm served his first communion in Falkner Swamp, and between the three congregations, there were over 100 communicant members. Boehm also drew up a constitution, which provided for government by a consistory, and adoption of the Heidelberg Catechism as a confessional standard. Boehm would function as a circuit rider between the congregations.  Controversy and ordination  In 1727, two years after Boehm began his ministry, an ordained German Reformed minister named George Weiss arrived in Pennsylvania. His arrival started a controversy, as Weiss argued that Boehm's ministry was in violation of Reformed polity, and was therefore invalid. Weiss's assertions created a division in the German Reformed Church. Some of Boehm's supporters sought the help of the American branch of the Dutch Reformed Church in New York, who arranged the ordination of Boehm by the Classis of Amsterdam, which occurred on November 23, 1729. The Dutch Reformed also validated the previous labors of Boehm, prior to ordination. In returned Boehm, Weiss, and the rest of the German Reformed submitted themselves to the oversight of the Dutch Reformed, an arrangement which lasted until 1793.  Later ministry  In 1730, the churches in the Philadelphia area were left under the sole care of Boehm after Weiss traveled to Europe to raise money for their cause in America. Weiss would return the following year, and eventually settled in Rhineback, New York. Along with his ministerial roles, in the 1730s and 1740s, Boehm faced dissention in his own ranks, as several prominent churchmen left for other denominations. In 1742, Count Nicolaus von Zinzendorf, the bishop of the Moravian Church arrived in Pennsylvania, attempting to unite the German Lutherans, Reformed and the Moravians into one church, which Boehm actively resisted. In 1746, in response to requests from Boehm for additional ministers, the Dutch Reformed sent Michael Schlatter to Pennsylvania, to assist Boehm, who was, by then, in his early sixties. He nevertheless continued on in his ministerial duties. It was on his way to a congregation near Allentown, Pennsylvania that he died, at the farm of his eldest son, on April 25, 1749, aged sixty-five.  Personal life  Boehm, in 1706, married Anna Maria Stehler. Between 1709 and 1725, the couple had eight children (four sons and four daughters) seven of whom survived infancy. Along with serving as a minister, Boehm had a 200-acre farm, which he purchased in 1736. Four years later, Boehm became a citizen of Pennsylvania.

Asiomorpha coarctata), the long-flange millipede, is a widely introduced species of Polydesmidan millipede of the family Paradoxosomatidae. It is presumed native to Southeast Asia but due to transport by humans occurs in tropical and sub-tropical areas throughout the world, including the Hawaiian Islands, the West Indies, Gulf Coast of North America, and the Gal√°pagos Islands. Description Males range from 14.5‚Äì20.5 mm in length and 1.5 to 2.7 mm wide while females are somewhat larger ranging from 16.5‚Äì27.5 mm long, and 1.6‚Äì3.2 mm wide. O. coarctata can be distinguished from Oxidus gracilis, another widely introduced Asian millipede, by having proportionally longer and pointier paranota (lateral keels) on mid-body segments and longer gonopods (male reproductive appendages). O. coarctata is unique within the genus Orthomorpha in that the gonopods have a single, simple tip, while other species have two or three lobes. This distinction has led some authors to place O. coarctata in a separate, monotypic genus, Asiomorpha.

Their releases, Iklwa, Gauna and Dipoko, pay homage to ancestral beliefs and African spirituality, while the band still plays in the vein of traditional heavy metal.  Band history  = Formation (2006) = Skinflint was founded by lead guitarist and vocalist Giuseppe Sbrana in 2006. He recruited Kebonye Nkoloso on bass guitar and Alessandra Sbrana on drums. Skinflint's music mixes elements of local traditional music with heavy metal, inspired by Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath. = Line-up change: the Iklwa era (2007-2011) = Drummer Alessandra Sbrana parted ways with Skinflint in 2007, and was replaced by Mothusi Mahuri. The band then began writing Massive Destruction, which was released on 6 June 2009. The album was never distributed outside of Botswana. In 2010 the band recorded their second album, Iklwa, and later launched the album at the Whiplash Metal festival in Cape Town, South Africa on 11 December 2010.

Kuspuks are tunic-length, falling anywhere from below the hips to below the knees. The bottom portion of kuspuks worn by women may be gathered and akin to a skirt. Kuspuks tend to be pullover garments, though some have zippers. Though kuspuks are traditionally a Yup'ik garment, they are now worn by both men and women of many Native groups, as well as by non-Natives. The garment was originally made of animal skin or gut and was worn over a fur parka to keep the parka clean. As stores became more common in Bush villages, kuspuks began to be made of calico grain sacks. Kuspuks are now generally made from brightly printed cotton calico, velvet, or corduroy trimmed with rickrack. Today, kuspuks are often worn as a blouse with pants. Many Alaska legislators and their staff members wear kuspuks on Fridays. The tradition was started by Representative Mary Kapsner (now Mary Sattler) of Bethel around 2000. The legislative dress code, however, requires that kuspuks be worn with dark pants. Legislators' enthusiasm for kuspuks has contributed to their rising popularity in the state. Travelers wearing kuspuks have faced scrutiny from airport security screeners the federal Transportation Security Administration because of the garment's looseness and bulkiness. Screeners have asked passengers to remove their kuspuks. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Mark Begich have criticized this security practice as culturally insensitive, as the kuspuk may not always be easily removed, since it may be worn \\"like a T-shirt or blouse\\", with no other shirts underneath. Pope John Paul II was presented a kuspuk as a gift when he visited Alaska in 1981.

Depending on the parameters used in the optimization mechanism, the algorithm can build three types of networks: a star network, a random network, and a scale-free network. Optimization mechanism is thought to be the underlying mechanism in several real networks, such as transportation networks, power grid, router networks, the network of highways, etc. General Properties The optimization mechanism is a model with growth, in which preferential attachment is valid under certain assumptions. As opposed to the copying model, the optimization model uses global information about the network, to connect the newly entering nodes to the existing ones, thus reducing the amount of randomness in the process. The model's mechanism is based on a cost-benefit comparison, that is for each entering node 'i', the algorithm calculates the net benefit (benefits minus costs) of connecting 'i' to each existing node, and connects node 'i' to the node which gives the highest net benefit.The Network Science Book Project , iBook, Page 8 Description The costs and benefits in the optimization models can generally be simplified into two attributes: the distance between the new node, and the existing one; and the distance of the existing node from the central node. Thus the goal function can be written in the following form: C_i=min_j[\\\\delta*d_{ij}+h_j] * where C_i stands for the minimal cost of attaching node 'i' to an existing node * d_{ij} denotes the distance between node 'i' and 'j' * h_j represents the distance of node 'j' from the central node * \\\\delta is a parameter, that determines the weight of the individual distance compared to the distance to the central node, and thus it varies across different settings. In a highway network setting - where cities are nodes and links are highways - d_{ij} would be the physical distance between cities, and h_j would be the distance from the capital (or from the central city of the region). The value of \\\\delta determines the type of the network built by the optimization mechanism. =Star Network= The optimization mechanism results in a star network, whenever \\\\delta<(1/2)^{1/2} . A unique feature of the star network is that most of the newly added nodes will connect to the central node regardless of the distance. One can think of a star network as a network in which the costs to establish a new link are negligible compared to the benefit of being directly connected to the central node. Star networks are rarely observed in reality. =Random Network= A random network is built using the optimization method when \\\\delta>N^{1/2}. In case of a high enough \\\\delta, the costs to establish a new link are enormously high, compared to the benefit of being closely connected to the central node. As a result, most of the new nodes will connect to the closest node available. A real life example is the power grid network, where the cost of building a power line is high, and the benefits of being directly connected to the power source is negligible. =Scale-free Network= 4<\\\\delta. If \\\\delta is neither too high, nor too low, the mechanism results in a scale-free network, characterised by preferential attachment. The newly added nodes tend to connect to the larger nodes, but sometimes they may connect to middle-size nodes, or even small ones, depending on their distance. Most of the real-life networks characterized by an underlying optimization mechanism are scale-free networks, such as the router network and the highway network.

To achieve a similar effect, powder can be replaced with a smoke machine; however, that requires a different set up.  Technical set up  To use powdered substances in photography it is essential to have a structured photo shoot set up. A minimum of two lights are needed. The main light (high speed flash in this case) is located at the front of the photo scene and back light(s) at the back of the scene to outline the powder. The powder is either thrown at the model at the moment of camera shoot by an assistant, or the model would perform a movement tossing the powder that was previously applied to the hair, arms, legs, etc. As a result, the photo shows captured movement of a model with a smoke-like effect.  Smoke machine  This type of technique is an alternative to a smoke machine. Some photographers prefer powder to the smoke machine as it is cheaper and also could be used at any location since it does not require electric power. The drawbacks of the technique are stained clothing, health hazards (with certain types of powder), and environmental pollution when using it outdoors.  Use in types of photography  Powder photography is used for engagement photo shoots, fighters, or dance performers to outline the movements of the specific body parts or the models as a whole.  Origin  The inspiration of powder photography comes from the holi festival of India where one of the traditions during the festival is to spray colors of rich pigment on each other.

Biography Swig was born in Pren (now called Prienai), Lithuania, close to the Belarus border, in 1862. In 1875, when Swig was 13, he immigrated to the United States. He quickly saw success in the U.S. banking industry, promptly earning enough to bring his parents to the United States. As his banking career grew, Swig also became involved in politics in his adopted home state of Massachusetts. Swig died on July 30, 1939, at the age of 76, of generalized arteriosclerosis and essential hypertension, at the Chase Convalescent Home in Taunton, Massachusetts, where he was living at that time. Financial career In the early 20th century, Swig became Vice President of the Tremont Trust Company, in Boston, Massachusetts, which soon became known colloquially as \\"Simon Swig's Bank.\\" Swig installed his son, Benjamin Swig, as the bank's treasurer. Alongside Tremont, Swig also gained control of the Tamiami Banking Company in 1926. Swig was a popular figure in the Boston banking world, but rose to prominence for his involvement in uncovering Charles Ponzi's banking irregularities known as the \\"Ponzi Scheme.\\" =Charles Ponzi= Early in his career, con man Charles Ponzi rented a room rented an office on Court Street, above the Puritan Trust Company. From that office, he hatched his first scheme, which involved stealing 5,387 pounds of cheese, valued at nearly three thousand dollars. Ponzi avoided jail due to a court clerk misspelling his name as \\"Charles Pouzi,\\" but his good luck ended shortly afterwards; Tremont Trust bought the Court Street building, and Swig wanted the swindler out of his new building. Ponzi and Swig's interactions did not end there. Once Ponzi's infamous scheme got started, he began keeping a large portion of his assets in Tremont Trust. As neither man liked the other, the money did not stay there long. On July 21, 1920, Swig wrote Ponzi a letter demanding he close his accounts: > If what we have heard about your plan of business is true, then certainly we > do not care to accept your deposits, no matter how large they may be. And > even if reports are untrue, we do not care to accept your future deposits > because you have taken unfair advantage in using our name as you have. We > therefore advise you that henceforth your deposits will not be accepted, and > you will favor us by closing your account. Ponzi did as Swig asked, leaving only $185,000, which was tied up in a lawsuit. One week later, as suspicion of Ponzi's success began to appear in the Boston Post, Swig took out a full-page ad which read, \\"Our dividends are paid out of our earned and collected income, and not out of other fellow's principal.\\" The ad did not mention Ponzi by name, but it was clear to Boston whom it was about. Another ad ran by Swig read, \\"REAL DOLLARS are still made in the old-fashioned way--working and saving. A real dollars cannot be made from bubbles,\\" which was clearly aimed at Ponzi as well. Swig appeared in an article in the Post a month later, written by William McMasters, Ponzi's former publicity agent. The article revealed that Ponzi was \\"hopelessly insolvent\\" and contained a quote from Swig questioning Ponzi's sanity. Ponzi was finished, and facing indictments and prison time, largely thanks to Swig. =Banking practices= Aside from his fame in the banking world due to his involvement in taking down Charles Ponzi, Swig made two bold steps in managing his business affairs that were ahead of his time, both of which unfortunately contributed significantly to the downfall of his banking career. Swig proposed that if the banking system collected interest on loans, it should pay interest on deposits as well‚Äì-an idea that today appears reasonable, but at the time was unheard of. As a lawmaker, he even raised this idea as a draft bill in the State Legislature of Massachusetts while he served there as a State Representative. Perhaps more controversial was Swig's hiring process. Swig was proud of his Jewish heritage and expressed it openly and encouraged others to be proud of their heritages. With that philosophy in mind, Swig did something that was simply not done at the time; he employed Jews, women and African- Americans as tellers at his banks branches. The practice was not appreciated in Boston, particularly by the local Bankers Guild. Joining together in a manner which is illegal today, his competitive bankers made a move against him: they deposited immense amounts of money in his bank, which he then used to provide loans to others, and once the Guild was assured that the money had been loaned out, it made a \\"run\\" on his bank and tried to withdraw all of its funds at one time. Swig managed to repay the Guild's money, but was dispossessed of his business. Political career Aside from banking, Swig enjoyed a storied career in Massachusetts politics. He served six terms as an alderman in Taunton, Massachusetts and five terms in the Massachusetts State Legislature, representing Taunton for two terms and Roxbury for three terms. He was also chairman and treasurer of the Republican City Committee in Taunton and held a position as a State Hospital Trustee for fifteen years under three different governors. Personal life Swig married Pearl Fannie Levy on June 7, 1881, and remained married until she died in 1934. Swig and Levy had eleven children, including Benjamin Harrison Swig, who became chairman of the Fairmont Hotel. Swig's descendants included Fairmont heir Melvin Swig, and notable real estate developers and philanthropists Steven, Robert and Kent Swig.

He has been busking since he was a Fine Art student at Oxford University in the early 1980s. He uses an electric violin he carved with a kitchen knife, a custom pedalboard and portable amplifier. This setup has enabled him to perform on the street in almost every major city in Europe, and across the United States and Canada. He was a member of the English post-punk/alternative rock band New Model Army, recording and touring with them for five years, with several concerts in Germany among over 200 concerts worldwide. They supported acts such as Simple Minds, Bob Dylan, David Bowie, The Cure, Midnight Oil and Faith No More. Early life Alleyne-Johnson was born in Liverpool in 1959 where his father, Brian, was a teacher. The pupils he taught included future Beatles members George Harrison and Paul McCartney. At the age of five, Alleyne- Johnson's father made him a wooden model of John Lennon's guitar to play. Subsequently, Alleyne-Johnson inherited a violin from his grandfather. Alleyne-Johnson learned to play violin at school and joined the Liverpool Schools Symphony Orchestra. He built his own electric violin at the age of 13 which was made of plywood and pine. At 16 Alleyne-Johnson's father bought him a bass guitar to enable him to join a school rock band. On leaving school Alleyne-Johnson was offered a place at Pembroke College, Oxford where he studied fine art. Whilst at university Alleyne-Johnson started busking and hitchhiked around Europe with friends. His guitar was too heavy so he took his grandfather's violin, which he had sprayed purple. He played the violin on the streets using an amplifier and digital delay equipment. This was to form the basis of his future work. During his time in Oxford in the late 1980s he played bass guitar in local band, Raindance. Three Raindance tracks were included on The Mad Hatters Club compilation album released on the independent March Hare Music label.March Hare Music website includes album, which is still in their catalogue, at 29 May 2014, Alleyne-Johnson is credited on the sleeve, there is a photo on the reverse of the sleeve on the company website. The band self-released a nine-track album (Raindance) in 1987 (catalogue no. Axis XIS 121). New Model Army period In 1989 Alleyne-Johnson was invited by a member of the band, New Model Army, to play violin as a session musician on Vagabonds, which was to be a track being recorded for their forthcoming Thunder and Consolation album. He partially improvised on this track and also played violin on two others. Vagabonds was released as a single in the UK and Alleyne-Johnson was invited to join the band and tour with them, playing violin and keyboards. As a member of the band he played on 5 albums (three studio and two live) released in the UK between 1989 and 1995. In addition to playing with the band on tour Alleyne-Johnson also supported the band with his own solo set featuring his own composition, Purple Electric Violin Concerto. Before New Model Army's 1991 American tour Alleyne-Johnson built a new, 5 string, electric violin which included a midi pick-up. At this point Alleyne- Johnson decided to record the Purple Electric Violin Concerto. Alleyne-Johnson left New Model Army after the recording of their 1993 album, the Love of Hopeless Causes. However he continues to play with them on tour. Solo work Alleyne-Johnson recorded Purple Electric Violin Concerto in 1992, recording all the tracks live with no overdubs or re-mixing. 500 cassettes of the album were produced . The sale of the cassettes funded a CD pressing of the album, which was subsequently released by Equation Records in the UK. Alleyne-Johnson promoted the album through a busking tour of UK record shops. In 1993 China Records licensed the album from Equation they reissued it and issued the track Oxford Suite part 1 as a single (Catalogue no. EQCDS01 Equation Records, under agreement with China Records Ltd). Alleyne-Johnson's second solo album Ultraviolet received significant interest in the UK reaching No. 68 on UK Albums Chart. in 1994. Purple Electric Violin Concerto 2 was released in 2001. Alleyne-Johnson's next 2 albums, Echoes, Reflections consist of instrumental covers of popular rock and pop tracks. The 2011 Arpeggio album led off with a crashing, cover version of The Who's Baba O'Riley and also included another cover of Human by The Killers; the album contains seven of Alleyne-Johnson's own compositions alongside seven covers. He has also released two further albums with his wife Denyze on their own Wingspan Records label. In July 2008, Alleyne-Johnson performed the Beatles tracks 'Yesterday' and 'Eleanor Rigby' in front of 7,000 people at Liverpool's Echo Arena for a Beatles Day charity gig. A 20th anniversary special edition of The Purple Electric Violin Concerto album was released in 2012. This consisted of a two-CD set containing a remastered version of the original album alongside a re-recorded version. Double CD concept album Pluto was released on December 8, 2017, featuring 22 original compositions inspired by the New Horizon fly-by of Pluto and the Brexit referendum result, imagining Britain not just quitting the EU but leaving Earth completely and relocating to the surface of Pluto, in the hope of a free trade deal with Alpha Centauri. Alleyne-Johnson has converted a Roland guitar synth module to work with his 5-string midi violin, and plays violin synth on many of the tracks alongside his more usual style. Alleyne- Johnson continues to busk alongside his other work. He has busked in nearly every major city in Europe and across America.Early Life, New Model Army Period and Solo work information originally sourced from published sleeve notes accompanying the 2012 Purple Violin Concerto ‚Äì 20th Anniversary Edition album (Catalogue no.

Maysville has long been a working class neighborhood; many late 1890s and early 1900s houses were bungalows and cottages, some with modest Victorian influences. Some larger and more decorated houses were built in the northeastern portion of the neighborhood. In the early 20th century and into World War I and World War II, the Port of Mobile and its shipyards became a focus of Mobile's economy, and the population grew in response.

Garcia was accused of forcing the alleged victim to marry him in 2007. As time moved on, the woman had a child with Garcia on October 27, 2010, or in 2012, and they continued to live openly together as a family in Bell Gardens, California, until the woman contacted her sister through Facebook and met with her mother in April 2014. She filed a domestic violence complaint with Bell Gardens police on May 19, 2014. As a married couple, Garcia and the woman had an apparently active social life in the community, including hosting large parties and the woman spending time and running errands by herself, having her own car, and working outside the home (with Garcia). However, police said the woman had tried to escape twice and been severely beaten. Through his attorney, Garcia claimed that the woman made up the story of abuse because the couple was breaking up.Flaccus, Gillian, and Abdollah, Tami, \\"Alleged California kidnapper: Wife fabricated horrible crimes because we were breaking up\\", Associated Press, May 22, 2014. After a trial in early 2016, Garcia was found guilty of three felony counts of lewd acts on a minor, was sentenced to four years and four months in prison, and was required to register as a sex offender. He was found not guilty of kidnapping, and the charge of forcible rape was dismissed.  Context of the case  Some neighbors and a nanny for their child reported that the man and woman were active as a couple in the local church and social community and showed no apparent signs of serious problems prior to the man's arrest.Kandel, Jason, and Medina, Mekahlo, \\"Nanny Describes Alleged Kidnapper, Victim as 'Perfect Couple'\\", NBC Los Angeles, May 22, 2014.Abdollah, Tami, \\"Neighbors: Alleged kidnapper is doting family man\\", Associated Press, May 21, 2014.McLaughlin, Eliott C., \\"Neighbors baffled that California woman missing for decade was kidnapped\\", CNN, May 22, 2014. A neighbor said \\"He treats her like a queen. He does his best to do whatever she wants\\", and said the woman had her own car. However, some other neighbors said they sensed that not all was well. One said that Garcia seemed to closely watch her, and that when she noticed he was watching from their apartment, she would rapidly go back inside. The girl was born in Mexico and had unlawfully entered the U.S. from Mexico in February 2004Flaccus, Gillian, \\"Police: Woman found 10 years after kidnapping\\", Associated Press, May 22, 2014. (about six months before her alleged kidnapping) to join her mother and sister who were living in Santa Ana, California.\\"Key moments in California kidnapping case\\", Associated Press, May 22, 2014. Garcia was the girl's mother's live-in boyfriend, and allegedly began abusing her while she lived with her mother. Following a domestic argument between the girl's mother and Garcia, the girl left home and went to a park, where Garcia found her and allegedly drugged and kidnapped her and then held her captive in a garage in Compton while telling her that no one was looking for her and that she would be deported if she was found. She was unable to speak English at the time, and Garcia allegedly used this to intimidate her. The girl's mother filed a missing person's report in August 2004, shortly after the alleged abduction, and had suspected that Garcia had abducted her. After she contacted her mother a decade later in 2014, her mother reportedly showed her old news articles to prove that she had been looking for her and had filed a missing person's report. This reportedly helped convince her to go to the police and file a report about her alleged abduction. It was alleged that during her captivity, the woman had been moved at least four times and had been given multiple fake identities. Garcia held various jobs during the period of the alleged captivity, and the woman and Garcia had been working together outside the home for a night cleaning service ‚Äì including cleaning a building that houses offices of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services.\\"Prosecutors say devoted husband is kidnap-rapist\\", Associated Press, May 23, 2014.Flaccus, Gillian, and Abdollah, Tami, \\"Victim is Lying about Alleged Kidnapping, Isidro Garcia's Lawyer Claims\\", Associated Press, May 22, 2014. At the time of the arrest, Garcia was also working a second job, at a nearby Chinese restaurant.Flores, Adolfo, and Esquivel, Paloma, \\"Kidnapping Claims Conflict with Neighbors' View of Bell Gardens Couple\\", Los Angeles Times, May 22, 2014.  Formal charges, trial, and outcome  On June 9, 2014, Garcia pleaded not guilty to charges including kidnapping, rape, and three counts of lewd acts on a minor.Esquivel, Paloma, \\"Man accused of kidnapping girlfriend's daughter pleads not guilty\\", Los Angeles Times, June 9, 2014. His bail was set at $1 million, and he reportedly faces up to 19 years in prison if convicted. In a report about the arraignment, neighbor Jose Polanco was quoted as saying \\"What she is saying is a lie,\\" and \\"She was a free woman,\\" and other neighbors were also reported to be supporting Garcia and portraying the couple as a seemingly happy pair who threw parties and took trips to Disneyland. On April 24, 2015, Garcia was ordered to stand trial on charges of rape and kidnapping. The trial began on February 11, 2016. The woman testified that Garcia kidnapped her in 2004, took her to a home in Compton, provided her with a false identity and held her against her will for a decade. Between August 2004 and April 2014, she said Garcia \\"controlled\\" her by saying her family did not want her and were not looking for her, and that if she reported him to police she would get in trouble for using a false ID. The teen did not speak English and had come to the U.S. from Mexico illegally, according to Santa Ana Police Department. The police department said that when she tried to escape, she was caught and beaten. A police news release in May 2014 alleged that \\"Even with the opportunity to escape, after years of physical and mental abuse, the victim saw no way out of her situation and lived a life with Garcia under sustained physical and mental abuse\\". According to the Orange County District Attorney, the woman became pregnant with his child in 2010. Police had previously said she had the child in 2012. She said he held her in captivity and got her a job where he worked and did not let her out of his sight, the district attorney stated. That job was at a nighttime cleaning service, according to police. The district attorney said that a decade-long ordeal first began in February 2004 when Garcia and the victim met while he lived with her and her mother. He allegedly then \\"groomed\\" the then-15-year-old by buying her gifts and siding with her during arguments with her mother. The woman claimed that he forcibly raped her at least once, sexually assaulted her three times, and touched her buttocks and kissed her. Santa Ana police first responded to a mutual domestic violence incident between Garcia and the woman's mother in August 2004, shortly before her disappearance, \\"but a case could not be proven at that time\\", according to the district attorney. The mother identified Garcia as her boyfriend and had told a neighbor prior to the alleged abduction that she believed they were having sex and planned on leaving together, the Los Angeles Times reported. On March 4, Garcia was found guilty of three felony counts of lewd acts on a minor, was sentenced to four years and four months in prison, and was required to register as a sex offender for life. He was found not guilty of kidnapping to commit a sexual offense, and a felony charge of forcible rape was dismissed by request of the district attorney after the jury was unable to reach a decision on that charge.

He also held appointments at Morningside College, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and the Royal Conservatory of Music. In his composition work, he created music for specific occasions or ceremonies, focusing on hymns and choral works, and collaborated with poets Robert Frost and William Carlos Williams to create music in conjunction with their works. His best-known orchestral work, Fantasy on a Hymn by Justin Morgan (1944), was recorded by Leopold Stokowski and Howard Hanson.  Early life, education  Canning was born in Brookville, Pennsylvania, on December 12, 1911. He matriculated at Oberlin College, where he studied composition under Normand Lockwood, receiving a B.M. in 1936. He received an M.A. from the Eastman School of Music in 1940, studying with Howard Hanson and Bernard Rogers.  Career  After receiving his degree from Eastman, Canning taught music theory and composition at Morningside College (1936‚Äì1941) and Indiana University of Pennsylvania (1945‚Äì1946). In 1946, he took a position with The Royal Conservatory of Music at the University of Toronto, teaching music theory in the RCM's newly created MBac program for training secondary and elementary school music teachers. Canning was appointed Assistant Professor of Theory at Eastman in 1947 and taught there until 1961, when he left for a year to serve at the University of Hull as a Fulbright professor. In 1963 Canning was hired as an associate professor at the newly opened Creative Arts Center at West Virginia University, receiving promotion to full professor in 1967, retiring in 1977. Canning belonged to the American Composers Alliance, The Hymn Society of America, and Pi Kappa Lambda, and was an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia.  Selected works  Many of Canning's works were written for specific occasions or events, or as part of specific collaborations with poets and authors. These works include: * Oh, Give Us Pleasure in the Flowers Today ‚Äì a hymn setting to music a poem of the same name by Robert Frost. * Covenant Service ‚Äì a musical setting for John Wesley‚Äôs Watch-Night Service for the first Sunday of the New Year. * Beyond Belief ‚Äì A light opera, 'a fantastic satire of the atomic age and all its perils,' staged by the Eastman School in May, 1956, and favorably reviewed. = William Carlos Williams collaborations = Lesser-known works include his collaborations with William Carlos Williams: * In 1948, Canning undertook, in collaboration with Williams, the development of an opera, Tituba‚Äôs Children, but the work was never performed. Williams later released the work as a play. * In 1950, he collaborated with Williams on Rogation Sunday, performed by Linwood Music School to music written by Canning. = Fantasy on a Hymn Tune by Justin Morgan = Since much of Canning's work was written for specific occasions, few of his compositions were published or recorded, with one notable exception. Fantasy on a Hymn Tune by Justin Morgan was composed as a response to a piece by British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis. Canning's piece was based on Amanda, a hymn from the 1790s by early American hymn singer and composer Justin Morgan. Written in 1944 in Canning's home town of Brookville, Pennsylvania, Fantasy on a Hymn Tune was premiered by the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra in 1946 as part of a program of new American music. The best-known recording was done by Leopold Stokowski and the Houston Symphony Orchestra in 1959, for Everest Records, a new label which utilized a recording technology designed for film soundtracks. This approach increased bandwidth and minimized the hiss that was characteristic of the period's analog sound recordings, producing a record that was considered very advanced for its time. The Stokowski recording was re-mastered and reissued in 2010 in a DVD-audio format that was considered to be of a quality superior to the standard CD format, an unusual achievement for a recording first released in 1960. The re- release was characterized as a classic ‚Äì lusher and ‚Ä¶ more expressive than anyone else. A variety of American symphony orchestras subsequently performed the piece, including recordings by Jesus Lopez-Cobos and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in 1997 (Telarc 80462), and by Raymond Leppard with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra in 1999 (Decca 458157). The piece was performed by the Denver Symphony Orchestra in May, 2011.  Personal life  Canning was married and had two children. His wife was a vocalist who sang church music both professionally and as an amateur. His son, also named Thomas, is a professional musician and Grammy-nominated producer. Canning's father, James Scribner Canning, was an accomplished classical banjo performer. The Canning Banjo Collection and Archive at the National Music Museum was donated in 1988 by Thomas Canning and his wife in memory of Canning's parents.  Legacy  In 1980, the Thomas Canning Composition Prize, was instituted to honor Canning at West Virginia University. Musicians, teachers, and composers who studied with Canning include: *Mark W. Phillips, distinguished professor of music at Ohio University ‚Äì Athens *W. Francis McBeth, composer of wind band works and professor of music at Ouachita Baptist University. * Joseph Willcox Jenkins, a composer and Professor of Music at Duquesne University * Charles Clement Fussell, a composer and music professor at Boston University * William Winstead, principal bassoonist with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, composer, and teacher at the University of Cincinnati College ‚Äì Conservatory of Music.

The David Compton House is privately owned historic home located in the small, unincorporated village of Mauricetown, New Jersey, located in Commercial Township, Cumberland County. The dwelling is composed of at least five distinct sections. It was built in 1816, originally as a 3-bay Federal style structure with a stylish entryway, including a decorative fanlight and sidelights, fluted moldings, and an 8-panel door. Probably during the 1830s, the house was enlarged to its present 5-bay fa√ßade with a Greek Revival porch spanning the center three bays. A large rear wing includes at least 3 distinct additions, including a room with exposed, beaded overhead joists, a rear ell kitchen addition with a winder staircase to the upstairs chambers, and flanking the main ells, a long shed addition that was reportedly a Victorian era porch before it was finished into interior living space. Setting The property is situated at the southwest corner of Front Street and High Street, a block to the west of the Maurice River. High Street is also State Route 676, while Front Street is State Route 744. However, because of a modern bypass road (State Route 649) has drastically reduced traffic through the small village, resulting in a quiet, tranquil atmosphere with minimal automobile congestion. Mauricetown is a small, gridded town consisting of two main roads running east-west and three side streets running north-south, forming about 10 blocks of mostly residential buildings. The village is built on high ground overlooking the Maurice River, which supported the village‚Äôs economic focus on shipping and shipbuilding. Mauricetown proper is surrounded on three sides by the grassy salt marshes, tidal flats, small creeks, and the Maurice River, and is located about 6 miles upriver from the Delaware Bay. The building stock is mostly historic, with the large majority being houses built between 1790 and 1900. The north (side) elevation shows the original Federal era section (far right), and an ell representing two different additions. Architectural history The evolution of the house is complex, displaying evidence of at least five building periods. The main block of the Compton House was originally only a three-bay dwelling, including the current stair hall and north parlor‚Äîthe only rooms with a cellar beneath. The house was expanded to a center hall plan around 1840 through the addition of the south parlor, which sits above a crawlspace. The Greek Revival porch, which spans the center three bays, was likely added at the same time. An interesting adaptation is the cut-out in the porch ceiling to accommodate the full height of the original fanlight above the original doorway. When David Compton died in 1838, his assets totaled $22,638, including a store on the property, several sailing vessels, a mill in the nearby village of Buckshutem, and significant grain and timber.David Compton Probate Inventory from 1839, on file in Surrogates Office, Cumberland County, New Jersey Considering his wealth and his household size ‚Äì 14 people including 4 adults ‚Äì it seems likely that it was David who expanded his house from the original three-bay structure. The original Federal style doorway of the David Compton House includes an 8-panel door, sidelights, and an elaborate fanlight. Also of note is the vaulted arch in the later porch ceiling, accommodating the original fanlight. The Compton house also has a two-story rear ell, for which the periodization is less clear-cut. One theory is that the middle portion of the ell was a one-story kitchen built at the same time as the more finished original house, and the ell was later expanded upward and backward. In the attic, an exposed fascia board for the front portion of the house indicates that at least the second story of the rear ell was a later building phase. Yet there are signs that the original ell could be an earlier, 18th-century structure that was attached to the 1818 house. The size and form of the middle section, which displays exposed beaded joists, resembles some 18th-century one-room dwellings in Cape May County. The rear portion of the ell was clearly a later addition, as revealed by the split rear stairs and a second set of carpenters marks in the attic.For a good explanation of \\"carpenters marks,\\" see http://historichouseblog.com/2013/06/24/what-do-you-call-it-carpenters- marks/. History The original spiral staircase continues from the 2nd floor to the 3rd. In June 1815, after 15 months of service in the U.S. Army, David Compton moved to Mauricetown, New Jersey. Just twenty-three years old and anxious to establish himself, Compton purchased ‚Äúone rood of land,‚Äù equal to ¬º acre, from his brother Ichabod‚Äîone of the early investors in the newly platted village.Deed 32/544 in Cumberland County, New Jersey, dated November 25, 1816, from Ichabod Compton to David Compton, for $350 The next year, David hired a builder, possibly Flagg Bacon, to build a 3-bay house overlooking the schooner landing at the bottom of the hill, but he also strategically placed his new house on the corner of an important crossroads. Compton‚Äôs location adjacent to High Street, the main road to Port Norris, afforded plenty of exposure for his store (no longer extant) at the rear of the property. But Compton also situated his house to face Front Street, the promising new main street on the Mauricetown waterfront.A Land Division map dated April 7, 1818 is on file in Cumberland County, New Jersey, recording the platting of the new village that had occurred a few years before. It is clear that David Compton was industrious from an early age and was already quite wealthy when he died young at age 45. By that time, his personal property alone, not counting any of his extensive real estate holdings, totaled over $22,000. In addition to the personal property, which included cash, shipping vessels, livestock, timber, and almost $2,000 in furniture,David Compton Probate Inventory from 1839, on file in Surrogates Office, Cumberland County, New Jersey his Land Division after his death listed an astounding 39 properties, including a mill in Buckshutem and the house on Front Street.Land Division document for David Compton Estate, 1840, on file in the Surrogates Office, Cumberland County, New Jersey Despite the fact that Compton owned so many properties, the house at 1201 Front Street was his home‚Äîwhich we know because of a land division document after his death, which describes the house as ‚Äúthe lot whereon the said David Compton lived previous to the time of his decease.‚ÄùDavid Compton Probate Inventory from 1839, on file in Surrogates Office, Cumberland County, New Jersey In 1830, eight years before he died, the Federal Census counted 14 people living in the house. So it is highly likely that it was David who made room by expanding the 3-bay Federal to a 5-bay Greek Revival, perhaps as early as the mid-1820s, when he married Eliza Buzby. In 1853, sea captain Samuel H. Sharp purchased the house and ¬º acre from James and Mary Compton. After Samuel died while in Cuba just 7 years later, the ownership of the house was suddenly split between his eight children. Sharp‚Äôs widow, Buelah (Buzby) Sharp, remained in the house until her death in 1910.United States Census Bureau, Census 1910.

The first three lines of each begin with Sur (On) followed by the naming of a place, and the last line is twenty times, like a refrain, J'√©cris ton nom (I write your name). The 21st stanza reveals that name, saying Pour te nommer Libert√©. (To name you Liberty). The first stanza reads:  Background  The original title of the poem was Une seule pens√©e (A single thought). √âluard comments:  Publication  The poem was published on 3 April 1942, without apparent censorship, in the clandestine book of poetry Po√©sie et v√©rit√© 1942 (Poetry and truth 1942). According to Max Pol Fouchet, he convinced √âluard to reprint the poem in June 1942 in the magazine Fontaine, titled Une seule pens√©e, to reach the southern Zone libre. The same year, it was printed in London in the official Gaullist magazine La France libre and thousands of copies were dropped by parachute by British aircraft of the Royal Air Force above occupied France maquis. In 1945, the poem was published by √âditions de Minuit in Eluard's poetry book Au rendez-vous allemand.

His first appearance was in Alpha Flight #9 (2005) and was created by Scott Lobdell and Clayton Henry. Fictional character biography Once assigned to the Imperial Guard of Japan, the elite branch of the National Police Agency responsible for protecting the Emperor, career police officer Captain Kioshi Keishicho was present years ago during an assassination attempt by the international terrorist organization known as HYDRA. Although the Emperor was not harmed in the attack, Keishicho was killed by the blade of the mutant Silver Samurai (Kenuichio Harada), who was affiliated with Hydra at the time.Big Hero 6 #2 (December 2008) Following his funeral rites, Keishicho's soul descended to Yomi, the Shinto nether realm, where he was confronted by Amatsu-Mikaboshi, the god of primordial evil. Sensing Keishicho's unsatiated thirst for vengeance, Mikaboshi offered to allow him to return to the mortal realm to exact revenge upon the man responsible for his death. Unaware of the strings attached to Mikaboshi's deal, Keishicho readily accepted. However, upon his return to the land of the living as a revenant, Keishicho was shocked to discover that he was permanently bonded to a suit of ebony armor modeled after that worn by the Silver Samurai. In addition, the katana sword he now wielded was mystically bonded to the essence of a shinma demon which subconsciously reminded him of the debt owed to Mikaboshi. Struggling to maintain a semblance of humanity and resist the shinma demon's corrupting influence, Keishicho began to investigate the whereabouts of the Silver Samurai, hoping to dispatch him as soon as possible so his soul could finally be at peace. Hearing that his target was affiliated with Big Hero 6, Keishicho infiltrated the team's Tokyo headquarters, only to learn that the Silver Samurai had since parted ways with the team and was presumed deceased. After a brief altercation, Keishicho explained his situation to Big Hero 6 and briefly operated alongside the team as the \\"Ebon Samurai\\", believing he had no other purpose to serve now that Silver Samurai was dead. He was among the team members present at the press conference where Big Hero 6 announced their intent to collaborate more closely with the Japanese government.Civil War: Battle Damage Report #1 However, upon learning that the Silver Samurai was still alive, Ebon Samurai immediately left the team to continue the pursuit of his murderer. He then wandered the Japanese countryside, struggling to keep Mikaboshi's dark influence in check as he investigated every possible lead to determine the Silver Samurai's location. Upon learning that Silver Samurai had become the bodyguard of the Japanese prime minister, Kiochi abandoned his quest for revenge, realizing that murdering Harada would constitute a betrayal of his country. He later accompanied his Big Hero 6 teammate Sunpyre (Lumina) to the Microverse to help her liberate her native planet of Coronar.Big Hero 6 #3-4 (January‚ÄìFebruary 2009) Powers and abilities Ebon Samurai's primary weapon is his katana, a traditional samurai long sword, which is mystically bonded to a shinma demon whose dark essence engulfs the sword's blade. He can use the sword, so enhanced, to slice through any known substance except adamantium. However, the demon's presence also corrupts Ebon Samurai's soul whenever he wields the katana. His offensive arsenal also includes a shorter wakizashi sword and sharpened, hand-held shuriken blades. Ebon Samurai's armor is constructed of an unknown metal native to Yomi and has enough articulation in the appropriate areas so as not to impede his movements. Ebon Samurai is trained in investigatory procedure and bushid≈ç (the samurai code of conduct), having learned both in Japan's National Police Academy. However, since his resurrection as an Earth-bound revenant, Ebon Samurai is prone to sudden outbursts of rage and violence whenever Mikaboshi's influence becomes too strong to repress.

Chambered in .38 S&W;, its cylinder held 5 shots. The single action version was produced in three varieties from 1876 through 1911, with total production exceeding 223,000. The Smith & Wesson Model 2 was a \\"top-break\\", with the barrel release catch located on the top of the frame, just in front of the hammer. It was a larger caliber version of the third model of the Smith & Wesson Model 1 1/2. Single Action In 1876, Smith & Wesson Model 2 debuted in a single-action format, meaning the hammer had to be cocked manually to set the trigger in order to fire the revolver. These revolvers were available in nickel or blued finishes. =1st Model= The first model of the .38 Single Action can be identified by its smooth barrel (lacking fluting), and the long extractor shroud similar to the Smith & Wesson Model 3 Russian pistol, which lent it the nickname \\"Baby Russian\\". It had a spur trigger and lacked a trigger guard. Models were available in blued or nickel-plated finishes, and the majority were produced with -inch or 4-inch barrels, although barrels as long as 7 inches were sold. Serial numbers range from 1 through to 25,548 between 1876 and 1877. This pistol was used by the Baltimore Police Department from 1876 to 1917 and such revolvers are marked \\"City of Balto\\". =2nd Model= The second model of the 38 Single Action used a shorter and more efficient ejection and extraction system and lack the shroud of the 1st model. It was produced in blued steel and nickel-plated versions, with most models having a -inch or -inch barrel. Rare versions had barrels of 6, 8 and 10 inches in length. These revolvers had a spur trigger, lacked a trigger guard and were serial numbered consecutively from 1 through 108,255. =3rd Model= The third model of the 38 Single Action was made from 1891 to 1911 and is often known as the 1891 Model, Model 01 or the Model of 91 as the latter is stamped on the top of the barrel. This version used a standard trigger and a trigger guard, but 2000 of these revolvers were made for the Mexican government with the spur trigger and no guard and are referred to as the \\"Mexican Model\\". Double Action In 1880, Smith & Wesson offered the Model 2 in a double-action format, whereby a single squeeze of the trigger both cocked the hammer and fired the revolver. These revolvers are easily recognizable by their fully enclosed trigger guard. The first such revolvers made by Smith & Wesson. These revolvers were available in nickel or blued finishes and a smaller version was offered in .32 Smith & Wesson. =Double Action 32= The Model 2 in .32 S&W; was made in 5 iterations. The initial version was a batch of 30 revolvers that were the first of such made by Smith & Wesson with a trigger guard in 1880. These models were deemed to be sub-par and did not leave the factory until 1888. The second version was improved and a total of 22,142 of these were manufactured until 1882. The third variant made from 1882 until 1885 included 22,232 revolvers. The fourth version was made from 1885 until 1909 and included 239,600 models. The final fifth variant included 44,641 pieces and was discontinued in 1919. =Double Action 38= The Model 2 in .38 S&W; was made in 5 iterations. The initial run consisted of 4000 revolvers in 1880. The second version was improved and a total of 115,000 of these were manufactured from 1880 until 1884. The third variant made from 1884 until 1895 included 203,700 revolvers. The fourth version was made from 1895 until 1909 and included 216,300 models. The fifth variant included 15,000 pieces and was discontinued in 1911. The third and fourth versions saw use as a police revolver for the cities of Cleveland, Ohio, Boston Massachusetts and Baltimore, Maryland as well as for security guards at the American Express Company. The final version of these top-break double-action 38's was the Perfected Model. This version used a top break with a sideplate thumb latch and was made from 1909 until 1920 for a total of 59,400 revolvers. This model was used by Floyd Allen in a courthouse escape attempt in 1913. =Smith & Wesson Safety Hammerless= The Smith & Wesson Safety Hammerless is a double- action revolver that was produced from 1887 to 1940 by Smith & Wesson. Based on the Model 2 double-action design, the revolver incorporated an internal hammer and an external grip safety on its back-strap. It was chambered in .32 S&W; and .38 S&W; calibers; these revolvers were discontinued prior to World War II, being eclipsed by the stronger hand-ejector models.

It is the seat of Protestant Regional Association, a group of Protestant congregations and deaneries in the city, and serves as the convention site for the Synod of the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau, held usually twice a year. The former monastery compound includes a Lutheran church building, called the Church of the Holy Spirit (). Founded in 1233, the monastery came under the possession of the city in 1803. Completely destroyed during World War II, it was rebuilt in 1955‚Äì1957 by the architect Gustav Scheinpflug based on the old floor plan and layout, but in the architectural style of the post-war period. Of the original Gothic structure, only the late Gothic style choir of the church remains.

The city assigned its members a plot of land near the medieval city wall (Staufenmauer), where they built a small house which would later serve as the monastery entrance. Construction of the actual monastery began in 1238, but the pace of building was slow due to the Order's reliance on alms from abroad. In 1245 the monastery buildings were completed, but the construction of the church on the southern part of the complex lasted a few more years. From a papal bull issued on May 30, 1259, the church appears to have already been consecrated at that time.Franz Henel, Die Frankfurter Dominikanerkirche. Aus ihrer Bau- und Kulturgeschichte, in: Frankfurter Kirchliches Jahrbuch 1959, pp. 9ff. =14th century= The monastery church was, after the imperial Collegiate Church of Saint Bartholomew the largest church in the city. It attracted several prominent scholars and preachers and received numerous donations from the local citizenry. The elections of the German kings Adolf of Nassau (1292), Henry VII (1308) and G√ºnther von Schwarzburg (1349) took place at the monastery.Anton Horne, Geschichte von Frankfurt am Main in gedr√§ngter darstellung, Frankfurt 1893, p. 84 The monastery was also involved in the conflict between Emperor Louis IV and Pope John XXII. After the Dominicans sided with the papacy, they were expelled from Frankfurt and other cities in 1330. They were allowed to return to Frankfurt after the city council and the citizenry appealed to the Emperor, but were obliged to not oppose the Emperor and clergymen loyal to him with either \\"words or works.\\"H. H. Koch, Das Dominikanerkloster zu Frankfurt am Main. 13. bis 16. Jahrhundert, Freiburg 1892, p. 44 In 1359 the Emperor Charles IV placed the Dominicans under his protection, a privilege that was regularly confirmed by his successors. =Late Middle Ages= In the 15th century the monastery was significantly expanded. A cloister was built in 1449 and further extended in 1499 so that it was fully enclosed in all four directions. In 1470‚Äì1472 the choir of the church was rebuilt in the late Gothic style. The monastery library became the largest in Frankfurt, although its collections were later transferred to the city library. In 1462 the Jewish residents of Frankfurt were forced to relocated to the Frankfurter Judengasse to the east of the monastery, on the opposite side of the Staufenmauer. The close proximity between the Dominicans and Jews became a source of tension, and conflicts between the two groups frequently arose. =Decline= The heyday of the monastery ended with the introduction of the Protestant Reformation in Frankfurt in 1533. The city council initially forbade the Dominicans from public preaching; it also planned to subject the property of the church to public use, and to inventory and regulate its donations. In response, the provincial chapter of the Order brought a lawsuit against the city before the Imperial Chamber Court, and the council eventually put its plans aside so as to not come into open conflict with the Emperor. The monastery remained a Catholic enclave in the Lutheran-dominated city until its secularization in 1803. The buildings were then acquired by the city of Frankfurt. During this time, the church underwent only minor changes, the most notable being the building of a Baroque extension on the western facade in circa 1680. In the 18th century the monastery served as the venue for most of the assemblies of both the Electoral Rhenish and the Upper Rhenish Circles of the Holy Roman Empire.Michael M√ºller, Die Entwicklung des Kurrheinischen Kreises in seiner Verbindung mit dem Oberrheinischen Kreis im 18. Jahrhundert, Frankfurt am Main 2008, p. 61 In 1790 the archbishop of Mainz dissolved the Dominican monastery and converted it into a new association, the Congregatio ad Sanctum Fridericum.Ernst Georg Gerhard, Geschichte der s√§kularisation in Frankfurt a. M., Stuttgart 1935, p. 18 =Secularization= The monastery in 1872 With the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803 the monastery fell to the Free Imperial City of Frankfurt. During the 19th century the monastery was used for several purposes, such as a storehouse for property taken by the city during secularization, a goods store and, after 1815, a barracks for the Linienbataillons, the military of the Free City. In 1809 eighty-two of the monastery's paintings, including works by Hans von Aachen and Philipp Uffenbach, were purchased and donated to the Frankfurt Museum; most of these pieces are now at the Historical Museum or on permanent loan at the St√§del. Plans to demolish the church were drafted in 1875, but were stopped due to the intervention of the Prussian Generalkonservator Ferdinand von Quast. Another demolition attempt in 1884 was also prevented, but renovation work was undertaken in 1885‚Äì1889 and a wall dividing the nave of the church was built. The eastern half, together with the choir, was used as a gymnasium for the Arnsburger School, which was itself housed in the monastic buildings, while the western side received the addition of an organ matroneum and several side rooms and was used as a public hall.Anton Horne, Geschichte von Frankfurt am Main in gedr√§ngter darstellung, Frankfurt 1893, p. 95 In the 1920s these additions were removed as part of a restoration of the church. =National Socialists, destruction and rebuilding= The ruined church in the 1950s Prior to the Second World War, the monastery was home to the Museum of Prehistory and Early History (now the Archaeological Museum). According to some sources, the church also served as a storage facility for works of art confiscated from deported Jews.Adolph Meurer, Die kunstgeschichtliche und reichsgeschichtliche Bedeutung des wiederaufgebauten Dominikanerklosters, in : Frankfurter Kirchliches Jahrbuch 1958, pp. 149ff. On March 18, 1944 the then secularised church was destroyed during the Allied bombing of Frankfurt.St√§dtebombardements Zweiter Weltkrieg: 22.3.1944: Frankfurt am Main. Feuerorkan Its ruins were removed in the postwar period, except for the remnants of the choir and north wall. With the adoptation of the Lutheran Reformation by the Free Imperial City of Frankfurt in 1533 the city had unilaterally appropriated all religious buildings within its jurisdiction, later added those which fell under its jurisdiction in 1803, such as the Dominican Convent. The status of the churches being city property but used by Lutherans (or Catholics) was statutorily fixed in 1830 by the deeds of dotation. One of the Lutheran congregation held usufruct of the , likewise destroyed in 1944. After the city had decided not to reconstruct that church, in 1953 the Lutheran congregation and the city concluded to exchange the congregation's usufruct to the destroyed Wei√üfrauenkirche for that of the to- be-rebuilt former convent with its former abbey. The city commissioned the architect for the project. The former Dominican abbey was rebuilt and on the second Sunday of Advent, 1961, the completed building was inaugurated as the new Lutheran Holy Spirit Church. It is now one of the city's dotation churches left for eternal usage by a Lutheran congregation. The Lutheran congregation enjoying usufruct of the Holy Spirit Church building is a member of the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau, comprising Lutheran, Reformed and United Protestant congregations. =The monastery today= The monastery is now the seat of the Protestant Regional Association of Frankfurt, which provides administrative and other support to the congregations and deaneries of the city. The Synod of the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau, usually held biannually, also takes place at the monastery. Architecture The modern interior of the church The old church was a three-aisled early Gothic hall without a transept, measuring 53.60 meters long and 15.60 meters wide.Unsere Stadtkirchen im Zentrum: Die Dotationskirchen der Stadt Frankfurt am Main ‚Äì Auf einen Blick It was built mainly from rubble stone, with parts of ashlar also present. The nave was eight bays long; the westernmost bay featured an ornate stellar vault, while the remaining bays had simple rib vaults. The vaults of the southern and slightly narrower north aisles of the nave were about one to two meters lower than the 11.60 meter central aisle. The vaults were supported by seven pairs of simple circular pillars featuring base plates and unadorned, cup-shaped capitals. Above the eastern pair of pillars of the nave was an octagonal Gothic fl√®che. During the bombing of March 18, 1944, the nave and several of the side aisle bays were destroyed and the inside of the church was burned. The chancel arch, a large portion of the pillars and several vaults of the nave initially survived, but these collapsed in 1954 before the start of rebuilding.G. Edelmann, Zur Baugeschichte der Dominikanerkirche in Frankfurt am Main. in: Schriften des Historischen Museums XI, Frankfurt am Main 1958, S. 46 Of the original church today only the outer walls of the nave choir, consisting of a bay with ribbed vaults, a five- eighths polygonal apse and the tracery of three of the five stained glass windows have been preserved. Of the monastery, the former sacristy (which now serves as a refectory) and the chapter house were preserved to an extent that their remains could be integrated into the new structure. The new building of the Church of the Holy Spirit was based on the austere aesthetics of the reconstruction period. Only the choir was restored to its old model. The new nave was again divided into three aisles by two rows of pillars. The existing foundations were retained, but the load distribution has been changed so that the supporting pillars accommodate a higher load than the previous building, while the exterior walls were relieved. The new building is also more than 10 meters shorter than the old monastery church. The church today can accommodate around 700 visitors.

These had their roots in traditional minstrel shows but included chorus girls, sketches and operas. They were part of the transition to the American burlesque shows of the early 20th century. Early years John William Isham was born in Utica, New York in 1866. He had some African-American ancestry but was fair-skinned and often passed for white. When he entered show business he was therefore allowed to assume responsible positions in management and advertising. He worked for the Ryan & Robinson circus in the 1883‚Äì84 season in the advertising department. He then worked for the Sells Brothers (1885‚Äì86) and Barnum & Bailey (1886‚Äì88). Isham was employed as advance man for the Creole Burlesque Show by Sam T. Jack. The show, which ran from 1890 to 1897, was the first to present beautiful black women as chorus girls in place of the traditional all-male chorus. It has been called the first black burlesque show. It included original songs, sketches and comedy numbers by black artists. Isham played a role of growing importance in the Creole Burlesque Show. In 1893 a writer in the Indianapolis Freeman said of Isham that he \\"has done more for the advancement of the colored race in all America than any other man since the day of its emancipation.\\" Octoroons Scene from The Octoroons. Left to right: Walter Smart, Stella Wiley, George Williams Isham decided to form his own company in 1895. This was the second major show to feature beautiful black chorus girls. It was first called Isham's Creole Opera, then renamed The Royal Octoroons and then Isham's Octoroons after Jack threatened to sue Isham over the name. The show was co-owned by Ernest Graff. The original Octoroons show had sixteen male and seventeen female performers. The Octoroons kept some of the structure of the traditional minstrel show, but with significant changes. The original show was in three parts, with scenes based on New York City. The first part opened with a chorus, followed by songs performed by the leading soloists, supported by the chorus girls. The second part was a burlesque sketch, a series of specialty acts very loosely woven into a story. The third part had a cakewalk jubilee, a military drill and a \\"chorus march\\". The show was organized in New York city. Venues included Waldman's Theatre in Newark, New Jersey; the Empire Theatre in Philadelphia; Howard's Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky; the Brooklyn Music Hall in Brooklyn, New York; the Corning Opera House in Corning, New York; the Park Theatre in Indianapolis, Indiana; and the Howard Atheneum in New York City. Performers in the original Octoroons included Madame Mamie Flowers, Fred Piper, Jesse Shipp, Billy Johnson, Mamie Emerson, Bell Davis, Bob Kelly, Tom Brown, Frank Mallory, Edward Mallory, Tom McIntosh, Hattie McIntosh, Shorty May, Ed Ferber and George Hammond. The show was well received. A critic wrote of Tom and Hattie McIntosh that \\"Both have an intelligent idea of low comedy, and their act is full of new and original humor.\\" The Octoroons toured for five years until 1900 in the Northeast and Midwest of the USA, and continued to run after Isham produced his Oriental America (1896‚Äì1899). Oriental America Poster for Oriental America Isham created a larger singing show named Oriental America, which opened at Palmer's Theatre on Broadway, Manhattan, in 1896. It was given good reviews, although it was not a huge commercial success. This was the first show to appear on Broadway with an all-African American cast. A reviewer in the Morning Times of Washington, D.C., wrote on 9 November 1896, \\"Scarcely has an audience left the theatre more thoroughly pleased and delighted over a performance than the one which filed out of the Academy of Music last week. The attractions was Isham's Oriental America, presented by a company of sweet singers and talented performers, the cream of the colored race.\\" The reviewer singled out the performances of the soprano Mattie Wilkes, the comedian Billy Eldridge, the tenor Sydney Woodward, vocalists Jesse Shipp and Edward Winn. Evolution Mattie Wilkes, Soprano The three-part format went through various changes over time. The shows now opened with a sketch, which before would have been the afterpiece. They then included star specialties, and ended with performances by the whole cast of popular operas and operettas. The shows were less uplifting and more cynical than the musicals that the Hyers sisters were presenting at the time. The Blackville Derby is a sketch about horse racing that does not depict upwardly mobile African Americans, but more lazy and cunning characters. In 1897 and 1898 Isham had three companies, two touring in the USA and one in Great Britain for a year. Each company opened with a new farce each season. The shows drew good audiences, but in most large cities were not staged in first-run theaters. Audiences in the USA were generally segregated. Some notable numbers were The Carnival of Venice (1895, operatic extravaganza); The Darkville Derby (1896), renamed The Blackville Derby (1897, skit about horse racing); Susanna Sampson's Wedding Day (1898, comic skit); The Ninth Battalion on dress parade, escorted by the Darktown Bandoleers, in a cake walk and jubilee (1898, skit); The Booking Agency (1900, comic sketch). A critic who saw the Oriental America company perform in Liverpool, England, wrote of it: By 1900 Isham was struggling against competing shows by Bob Cole and Williams & Walker. He retired from managing the shows. His brother Will Isham attempted to continue the Octoroon company with an operatic comedy show called King Rastus (1901‚Äì05) that reverted to the earlier tradition of minstrel or \\"coon\\" shows. It discarded all the advances that John Isham had introduced.

Design and construction From its foundation in 1871, the U.S. Commission of Fish and Fisheries, more generally known as the U.S. Fish Commission, recognized a need for ships to operate along the coast of the United States to engage in exploration, conduct surveys, and perform scientific research on marine resources. In addition, fisheries scientists of the time believed that successful spawning was the most significant factor in the productivity of fisheries; the spawning of American shad at the time was the most important fishery in the United States, and because shad runs lasted only a month in any given location, a floating fish hatchery that could move along the coast was deemed more cost-effective than constructing shad hatcheries along the entire U.S. East Coast. The United States Department of the Navy loaned the Fish Commission a small steam launch to conduct its field work during the summer of 1871. The Commission had no ship in 1872, but during each summer from 1873 through 1875 the Navy Department loaned it the 100-ton steamer Blue Light. The Commission again had no ship in 1876, but the Navy Department loaned it the 306-ton steamer Speedwell during the summers of 1877, 1878, and 1879. These vessels were only minimally modified for fisheries research work, with only primitive equipment installed. The Fish Commission clearly required a vessel designed specifically for service as a floating hatchery and fisheries research ship, and so in 1879 the United States Congress appropriated $45,000 (USD) for the construction of a fisheries research steamer to be named Fish Hawk. A laboratory below deck aboard USFC Fish HawkThe Fish Commission chose a design by C. W. Copeland of the United States Lighthouse Board, and the Pusey and Jones Company built the ship at Wilmington, Delaware.Anonymous \\"Out With the Fish-Hawk,\\" The New York Times, September 20, 1880 Fish Hawk had a fore-and-aft two-masted schooner rig, coal-fired steam propulsion, and twin screws, and was intended for coastal work rather than oceanic research. She had an iron hull sheathed with about of yellow pine, caulked and coppered. Her hull was divided by five iron bulkheads, four of them watertight. Above the main deck she was of wooden construction. The pilot house, captain's quarters, and a laboratory were on a promenade deck extending along the entire length and across the entire width of the ship. For propulsion, she had two inverted-cylinder surface-condensing steam engines, each driving one of her two screws,Report of the Commissioner, 1881, Appendix I, p. 9 and a coal-fired overhead, return-flue boiler.Report of the Commissioner, 1881, Appendix I, p. 14. She had a fore-and-aft schooner rig and three sails, a fore staysail, a foresail, and a mainsail.Report of the Commissioner, 1881, Appendix I, pp. 5, 8. Fish Hawks main deck was filled with hatching equipment to allow her to serve as a floating hatchery for American shad, striped bass, mackerel, and herring. A pump supplying of water per hour and two distribution tanks fed the equipment. Fertilized fish eggs were placed in 36 hatching cones, each capable of hatching 200,000 American shad eggs, and feed valves regulated the current through the cones to keep the eggs gently in motion so they would not mat or settle to the bottom. Fish Hawk also had 18 hatching cylinders - each capable of holding 250,000 eggs - with wire gauze bottoms; the cylinders were suspended from beams hanging over the sides of the ship and partially submerged, with nine on each side. Cam machinery caused the cylinders to rise gently and drop more rapidly for about , which made the eggs circulate freely without settling on the bottom. Fish Hawk also was outfitted to conduct general scientific research related to fisheries, including depth sounding, measuring the temperature of the sea bottom, and collecting marine animals and plants. She had a hoisting winch with of steel cable for trawling and dredging, an otter trawl, a beam trawl, an beam trawl, a beam trawl, Blake and Chester rake dredges, and a tangle bar, the latter an iron axle and wheels with deck swabs or bundles of rope yarn on chains that Fish Hawk could drag along the sea bottom to capture marine animals and plants. For hydrography, she had a sounding machine with of piano wire, deep-sea reversing thermometers, and density salinometers. Fish Hawk carried a number of boats: a steam cutter,Report of the Commissioner, 1881, Appendix I, pp. 8‚Äì9. a ten- oared cutter, a gig, a dinghy, and several flat-bottomed boats, the latter for use in spawn-taking. She had a crew of 84 and berthing for another 25 people on temporary assignment to the ship, such as scientists, technicians, or passengers aboard as observers. The Fish Commission detailed United States Navy Lieutenant Zera Luther Tanner to oversee the construction of Fish Hawk. She was launched on 13 December 1879. On sea trials on 19 February 1880, she averaged during a six-hour run of . She was completed on 23 February 1880, when the Fish Commission took delivery of her, but the Commission then had to await a 2 June 1880 appropriation of funds to begin to purchase her outfit (anchors, boats, signal flags, chronometer, nautical charts, nautical instruments, and so forth) and construct and install her hatching equipment;Report of the Commissioner, 1881, Appendix I, p. 16 Pusey and Jones also built the hatching equipment, but under a separate contract from the one for Fish Hawks construction. In the meantime, Tanner became her first commanding officer on 12 March 1880, and she was commissioned that spring. Procuring Fish Hawks outfit and constructing and installing her hatching equipment took most of June and July 1880. The first large ship purpose-built by any country for the promotion of fisheries, Fish Hawk greatly impressed foreign observers at the time of her completion. After viewing a model of Fish Hawk at the American exhibit at the International Fisheries Exhibition in Berlin in 1880, the director of the German Empire‚Ä≤s hatching establishment at H√ºningen wrote, \\"Lost in astonishment, we stand before the large model of the Fish Hawk, a large steamship specially constructed by the American Government for purposes of pisciculture.\\"Report of the Commissioner, 1884, p. 1170. Service history USFC Fish Hawk in the Potomac River at a pier at Bryan Point, Accokeek, MarylandFish Hawk was designed to work year-round in an annual cycle in which she engaged in scientific research involving trawling and dredging in the summer, then steamed north to collect and hatch cod eggs in late autumn. With the arrival of winter, she steamed south to hatch shad eggs, moving to various points along the coast during the winter and spring in accordance with the natural timing of shad runs. With those completed, she renewed the cycle by returning to research work during the following summer. As fisheries researchers later came to understand the reproduction of Spanish mackerel and striped bass, Fish Hawk added hatching of these species to her annual routine. Although her hatching equipment was not yet fully complete and installed, the Fish Commission wanted Fish Hawk to begin deep-sea exploration activities before the 1880 season was over, and decided that she should get underway and return to the Pusey and Jones shipyard later for the installation of the remainder of her hatching equipment.Report of the Commissioner, 1881, Appendix I, p. 30. Accordingly, Fish Hawk departed the Pusey and Jones shipyard on 29 July 1880 with a United States Navy crew commanded by Lieutenant Tanner and proceeded to Fish Commission headquarters at Newport, Rhode Island, where she arrived on 2 August 1880. She made her first scientific cruise on 6 August 1880, embarking naturalists and spending the day trawling and dredging in Narragansett Bay west of Conanicut Island to test her equipment.Report of the Commissioner, 1881, Appendix I, pp. 30‚Äì31. On 3 September 1880, she briefly visited Woods Hole, Massachusetts, her future home port, for the first time.Report of the Commissioner, 1881, Appendix I, p. 32 Fish Hawks capabilities launched a new era in both fisheries research and fish culture. In 1871 and 1875, the Fish Commission had studied the shallow waters in the vicinity of Woods Hole thoroughly, but until the commissioning of Fish Hawk had lacked a vessel able to operate farther offshore and gather information in deeper water.Report of the Commissioner, 1886, p. 693. Her first assignment was to investigate a previously unknown fish, the tilefish, which a commercial fisherman had brought to the Fish Commission station in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 1879. During September and early October 1880, operating from Newport, she made four voyages to dredge the edge of the continental shelf, during which she gathered data establishing the range and quantity of the tilefish, which later would become an important fishery. Such were her scientific capabilities that she also discovered 40 new species of mollusk and 20 new species of fishes during the four voyages; in the Report of the Commissioner for 1886, published in 1889, the Fish Commission described it as \\"a new and exceedingly rich fauna, both as regards fish and marine invertebrates.\\"Report of the Commissioner, 1886, p. 915. With the four voyages completed, she returned to Wilmington from 13 October to 13 November 1880 to have her hatching cones installedReport of the Commissioner, 1881, Appendix I, p. 36. so that she could begin her first hatchery work with shad eggs off the southeast coast of the United States by about March 1881. With the cones installed, she proceeded to the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., where she arrived on 20 November 1880 and turned over samples collected during the 1880 season to the Smithsonian Institution.Report of the Commissioner, 1881, Appendix I, p. 37. She then steamed to Point Lookout, Maryland, to collect oysters for the Fish Commission station at St. Jerome's Creek in Maryland.Report of the Commissioner, 1881, p. xli. Plans called for her to spend the winter of 1880‚Äì1881 at the Washington Navy Yard, but ice formed on the Potomac River before she could return there, so instead she spent the winter at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia. On 21 May 1885 Tanner was reassigned and replaced by Lieutenant (junior grade) Robert Platt, a veteran of the American Civil War. Fish Hawk went on to serve the Fish Commission and its successor, the United States Bureau of Fisheries, for nearly 46 years, trawling and dredging to discover and investigate new fishery resources and to collect marine animals and plants to gather information about their identity and life history. She worked on the continental shelf along the entire U.S. East Coast from Maine to Florida, as well as in the Gulf of Mexico and off Puerto Rico. In December 1916, Fish Hawk participated in the eighth annual Convention of the Southern Commercial Congress in Norfolk, Virginia, joining the Bureau of Fisheries steamer in exhibiting several fishery-related items and devices.afsc.noaa.gov AFSC Historical Corner: Roosevelt, Bureau's First Pribilof Tender Retrieved September 15, 2018 Fish Hawk made her last two cruises between October and December 1925, and the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries decommissioned her in January 1926.Galtsoff, Paul S., The Story of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries Biological Laboratory Woods Hole, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C.: United States Department of the Interior, 1962, p. 40.

(After Qian Hongzun's death, his father would (at least in words) consider the possibility of passing the throne to a member of another branch of the Qian clan before affirming the heir status of Qian Hongzun's younger brother Qian Hongzuo, further suggesting that he did not consider his four older sons to truly be members of his clan.)  During Qian Yuanguan's reign  In 932, Qian Liu died. Qian Chuanguan took control of the state (and changed his name to Qian Yuanguan), but did not claim the title of king at that time, but only the military governor of Zhenhai and Zhendong, as a vassal to Later Tang of the Central Plains.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. Qian Hongzun received the title of deputy military governor of Zhenhai and Zhendong, and military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Guo Prefecture (ÊûúÂ∑û, in modern Nanchong, Sichuan ‚Äî a completely honorary title as Guo was then under the control of Later Shu). In 937, by which time Later Tang had fallen and Wuyue was a vassal state of Later Jin, Qian Yuanguan assumed the title of king. He created Qian Hongzun as his heir apparent,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. and had a mansion built for Qian Hongzun. Qian Hongzun, however, would die in 940, before his father, who would eventually pass the throne to Qian Hongzuo.

Umakant Premanand SHAH, 1959 Major images  Two images of Jivantasvami, (representation of Mahavira who was still a prince), are widely mentioned examples of the early western Indian school of art. One of them is specifically inscribed as jivantsvami installed by Nagisvari, which represents early phase of the Gupta style. Two images of Tirthankara (one of Parsvanatha) are from the post-Gupta period. An image inscribed as donated by Sadhu Sarvadeva include eight standing figures representing the eight planets, on both sides of the dharmachakra.

History Macknade sugar plantation viewed from the Herbert River, 1874 The Macknade Sugar Company opened a sugar plantation and the Macknade Sugar Mill in the area in 1874. The district took its name from the mill, which in turn took its name from a house in Kent, England where the mill's owners had lived. Macknade State School opened on 13 November 1893. The postal receiving office opened in about 1901 and became a post office in October 1902. The post office closed on 29 October 1993. In the 2011 census, Macknade had a population of 304 people. Economy The Macknade Sugar Mill is situated on the banks of the Herbert River. It is the oldest raw sugar mill in Queensland. Its highest output was in 2005 when it crushed 1.82 million tonnes of sugar cane. The estuarine location of Macknade is well-suited for sugar growing, but it is also well-suited for aquaculture.

Several years ago, the dwelling was moved from its original location after being purchased by the Historical Society.Deed of Sale from Lewis B.

In Historic Themes and Resources Within the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route; Southern New Jersey and the Delaware Bay: Cape May, Cumberland, and Salem Counties. The Hoy House consists of a one-pile main block with a shed kitchen addition, and is entirely clad in whitewashed clapboard siding. Wooden window and door surrounds are simple and painted green. Interior spaces follow suit, and are also devoid of ornament. A small winder stair is located on the fireplace wall, which is another feature typical of southern New Jersey stack houses.Ibid. The garret space located above the shed kitchen retains some original timbers, mostly notably along the north, west, and east walls. Original timbers are mill sawn, with mortise and tenon joinery.

Completed in 1892, the ship was part of the Danube Flotilla, and fought various Allied forces from Belgrade down the Danube to the Black Sea during World War I. After brief service with the Hungarian People's Republic at the end of the war, she was transferred to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and renamed Morava. She remained in service throughout the interwar period, although budget restrictions meant she was not always in full commission. During the World War II German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Morava was the flagship of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division, and operated on the River Tisza. She fought off attacks by the Luftwaffe, and shot down one enemy aircraft, but was forced to withdraw to Belgrade. Due to high river levels and low bridges, navigating monitors was difficult, and she was scuttled by her crew on 11 April. Some of her crew tried to escape cross-country towards the southern Adriatic coast, but most surrendered on 14 April. The remainder made their way to the Bay of Kotor, which was captured by the Italian XVII Corps on 17 April. She was later raised by the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, an Axis puppet state, and continued in service as Bosna until June 1944, when she struck a mine and sank. Description and construction The name ship of the K√∂r√∂s-class river monitors was built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy by H. Sch√∂nichen. She was laid down at Budapest on 30 March 1890. K√∂r√∂s and her sister ship doubled the size of Austria-Hungary's Danube Flotilla. The two monitors each had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . Her displacement was , and her crew consisted of 77 officers and enlisted men. The ship was powered using steam generated by two Yarrow boilers driving two triple-expansion steam engines, and carried of coal. Her engines were rated at and she was designed to reach a top speed of . K√∂r√∂s was armed with two single gun turrets of /L35 fore and aft, two superfiring /L42 anti- aircraft guns protected by gun shields on the superstructure fore and aft, and two machine guns. Her main guns fired a armour-piercing, high explosive, shrapnel or fragmentation shell to a maximum range of at an elevation of 20¬∞. They could depress to ‚àí6¬∞ and elevate to +25¬∞. Her armour consisted of a belt and bulkheads thick, deck armour thick, and conning tower and gun turret armour thick. The armour was produced by the Witkowitz steel works, in Moravia. She was launched on 5 February 1892 and commissioned on 21 April of the same year. Her sister ship Szamos was completed in 1893, and was identical except for armour on her conning tower. Career =Commissioning and World War I= Serbian campaign At the start of World War I, K√∂r√∂s was based at Zemun, just upstream from Belgrade on the Danube. Her commander was Linienschiffsleutnant (LSL) Josef Meusburger, and she was accompanied by another three monitors and three patrol boats. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914, and that night the flotilla fired the first shots of the war against fortifications at the Zemun‚ÄìBelgrade railway bridge over the river Sava and on the Topƒçider Hill, although K√∂r√∂s was not initially involved. The Serbs were outgunned by the monitors, and by August began to receive assistance from the Russians. This support included the supply and emplacement of naval guns and the establishment of river obstacles and mines. The Austro-Hungarian base at Zemun was briefly evacuated due to a Serbian counterattack in September. On 28 September, K√∂r√∂s, along with the monitor , a patrol boat and a minesweeper, broke through the minefields on the Sava near Belgrade and pushed upstream to join the fighting near ≈†abac. In November, French artillery support arrived in Belgrade, endangering the monitor's anchorage. The stalemate continued until December 1914 when the Serbs briefly evacuated Belgrade in the face of an Austro-Hungarian assault, although K√∂r√∂s did not support this action. After less than two weeks, the Austro-Hungarians had to withdraw from Belgrade, and it was soon recaptured by the Serbs with Russian and French assistance. K√∂r√∂s continued in action against Serbia and her allies at Belgrade until December, when the base of the Danube Flotilla was withdrawn north to Petrovaradin for the winter. In January 1915, British artillery arrived in Belgrade, further bolstering its defences. On 22 April 1915, a British picket boat that had been brought overland by rail from Salonika was used to attack the Danube Flotilla anchorage at Zemun, firing two torpedoes without success. Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in September 1915, and the Serbian Army soon faced an overwhelming Austro-Hungarian, German and Bulgarian ground invasion. On 7 October, the Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army attacked Belgrade, and K√∂r√∂s, along with the majority of the flotilla, was heavily engaged in support of the crossings near the Belgrade Fortress and Ada Ciganlija island. During the final river crossing and support of the resulting bridgehead, the ship provided close support, during which her stack was hit and damaged. The following day, K√∂r√∂s assisted SMS Enns when the latter took a direct hit and began to take on water. Following the capture of Belgrade, the flotilla sailed downstream to Or»ôova near the Hungarian‚ÄìRomanian border and waited for the lower Danube to be swept for mines. It then escorted a series of munitions convoys down the Danube to Lom, from where they were transferred to the Bulgarian railway system for shipment to the Ottoman Empire. Romanian campaign In November 1915, K√∂r√∂s and the other monitors were assembled at Ruschuk, Bulgaria. The position of Romania was uncertain; the Central Powers were aware that the Romanians were negotiating to enter the war on the opposing side of the Entente. To protect the Danube's border between Romania and Bulgaria, the flotilla established a sheltered base in the Belene Canal. When the Romanians entered the war on 27 August 1916, the monitors were again at Rustschuk, and were immediately attacked by three improvised torpedo boats operating out of the Romanian river port of Giurgiu. The torpedoes that were fired missed the monitors but struck a lighter loaded with fuel. The Second Monitor Division, consisting of K√∂r√∂s and three other monitors, was tasked with shelling Giurgiu. This bombardment set fire to oil storage tanks as well as the railway station and magazines, and sank several Romanian lighters. While the attack was underway, the First Monitor Division escorted supply ships back to the Belene anchorage. The K√∂r√∂s and her companions then destroyed two Romanian patrol boats and an improvised minelayer on their way back to Belene. This was followed by forays of the monitors both east and west of Belene, during which both Turnu MƒÉgurele and Zimnicea were shelled. In April 1918, K√∂r√∂s, along with three other monitors, two patrol boats and a tug, were formed into Flottenabteilung Wulff (Fleet Division Wulff) under the command of Flottenkapit√§n (Fleet Captain) Olav Wulff. Flottenabteilung Wulff was sent through the mouth of the Danube and across the Black Sea to Odessa, where it spent several months supporting the Austro-Hungarian troops enforcing the peace agreement with Russia. It returned to the Danube at the end of August, and was anchored at BrƒÉila on 12 September. On 16 October, K√∂r√∂s and the rest of the First Monitor Division sailed from BrƒÉila to Belene. For several weeks the Danube Flotilla was engaged in protecting Austro-Hungarian troops retreating towards Budapest, fighting French and irregular Serbian forces as they withdrew; the flotilla arrived in Belene on 6 November. =Interwar period and World War II= 1919‚Äì41 alt=a black and white photograph of a ship tied up at a berth After the Armistice of Villa Giusti signed by the Austro-Hungarians on 3 November 1918, K√∂r√∂s was operated by the navy of the Hungarian People's Republic between 6 November and 13 December. She was then crewed by sailors of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) in 1918‚Äì19. Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye concluded in September 1919, K√∂r√∂s was transferred to the KSCS along with a range of other vessels, including three other river monitors, but was officially handed over to the KSCS Navy and renamed Morava in 1920. Her sister ship Szamos was dismantled and used as a pontoon. In 1925‚Äì26, Morava was refitted, but by the following year only two of the four river monitors of the KSCS Navy were being retained in full commission at any time. In 1932, the British naval attach√© reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in little gunnery training, and few exercises or manoeuvres, due to reduced budgets. 1941‚Äì45 On 6 April 1941, when the World War II German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia began, Morava was based at Stara Kanji≈æa on the Tisza river, as the flagship of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division. This force was responsible for the Hungarian border, and came under the operational control of the 7th Infantry Division Potiska. The remainder of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division consisted of the river tug R-XXI, the river transport Senta, and a few mobilised customs motorboats, based further south on the Tisza at Senta. On 7 April, Morava withdrew to Senta, where she was attacked by German aircraft. According to her commander, Poruƒçnik bojnog broda Bo≈æidar Aranƒëeloviƒá, her crew shot down one German aircraft and captured a Luftwaffe Oberstleutnant. On 10 April, Morava was ordered to withdraw to conform with the retreat of the 2nd Army Group of the Royal Yugoslav Army from Baƒçka and Baranja. On the evening of 11 April, Morava anchored at the confluence of the Danube and Sava near Belgrade, along with her fellow monitors Vardar and Sava, and Aranƒëeloviƒá took command of the flotilla. The three captains conferred, and decided to scuttle their vessels due to the high water levels in the rivers and low bridges, which meant insufficient clearance for the monitors to navigate freely. The crews of the monitors were transshipped to two tugboats, but when one of the tugboats was passing under a railway bridge, demolition charges on the bridge exploded prematurely and the bridge fell onto the tugboat. Of the 110 officers and men aboard the vessel, 95 were killed. After the scuttling of the monitors, around 450 officers and men from the Morava and various other riverine vessels gathered at Obrenovac, and armed only with personal weapons and some machine guns stripped from the scuttled vessels, started towards the Bay of Kotor in the southern Adriatic in two groups. The larger of the two groups only made it as far as Sarajevo on 14 April before they surrendered. The smaller group made their way to the Bay of Kotor, and was captured by the Italian XVII Corps on 17 April. Morava was later raised and repaired by the navy of an Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, in which she served as Bosna. She served alongside her fellow monitor Sava, which had also been raised and repaired, but retained her name. Along with six captured motorboats and ten auxiliary vessels, they made up the riverine police force of the Croatian state. Bosna was part of the 2nd Patrol Group of the River Flotilla Command, headquartered at Zemun. She struck a mine near Bosanski Novi on the River Una and sank in June 1944. The following year she was raised and broken up.

He did not enjoy a lot of game time, with Springboks Breyton Paulse and Pieter Rossouw being the first choice wings for Western Province at the time. =2001= At the start of the 2001 season, Stormers coach, Gert Smal released him to the Sharks in an attempt to gain more game time. He started in three Super 12 games for the Sharks and played in a further four, coming off the replacements bench. After the Super 12 season, he was back in Cape Town to play for Western Province in the Currie Cup. =2002 to 2003= In 2002 and 2003, Theron was again part of the Western Province Vodacom Cup squad. In 2002 he also made a return to the Stormer's Super Rugby squad and formed part of Western Province's Currie Cup squad later in the year. In 2003 Springbok coach Rudolf Straeuli selected Theron in the 28-man Springbok squad for the away leg of the 2003 Tri Nations Series. This was a controversial selection as Theron did not have a particularly good Super 12 campaign. He was due to make his Springbok debut against Australia on 2 August 2003 at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. Unfortunately he had to withdraw from the game due to a hamstring injury and was never again selected for the Springboks. =2004 to 2006= From 2004 to 2006 Theron was a regular in Western Province's Vodacom Cup and Currie Cup squads. He also featured in a number of Super Rugby games for the Stormers. In total, Theron played 130 games for the Stormers and Western Province.

The park was platted, designed and constructed between 1923 and 1930, with the Clarence Hatzfeld-designed field house completed in 1930 under the auspices of the Albany Park District. The Chicago Park District was consolidated in 1934 and took over Eugene Field Park. The park has seen numerous changes and improvements over the years. Eugene Field park has tennis courts, athletic fields, a playground, two bridges and 60 foot tall light tower. Together, the park, and its historic features were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. History =1920s= Author of Wynken, Blynken, and Nod, and park namesake Eugene Field. Eugene Field Park is located on 16 acres of land along the North Branch of the Chicago River in the Northwest Side neighborhood of Albany Park. The river cuts a diagonal path across the park site. Originally, the park was one of 2 parks commissioned by the now defunct Albany Park District. The Albany Park District made the first land purchases for what was then known as Central Park in 1923, but park improvements were not undertaken until 1925.Bachrach, section 7, p. 1 (p. 7 of pdf). The Albany Park District officially changed the park's name from Central Park to Eugene Field Park in November 1926. The park is named for Eugene Field, an important American writer; Field's name may have been selected through a contest held by the park district. He was born in St. Louis but lived in Chicago after 1883 where he worked as a journalist. Field is best known for his work as a children's poet (Wynken, Blynken, and Nod, Little Boy Blue).Bachrach, section 8, pp. 12-13 (pp. 18-19 of pdf). =1930s and 1940s= WPA project included the construction of a retaining wall along the Chicago River. By 1930 nearly half of Albany Park's population was Jewish, about 23,000 people. Much of Albany Park's Jewish population was concentrated in a small area bounded by the Chicago River (east), Pulaski Road (west), Foster Avenue (north) and Montrose Avenue (south). Eugene Field Park, along with Bohemian National Cemetery, was one of the several open tracts of land in that area. As such, Jewish residents of Albany Park would often use Eugene Field Park as a gathering point. The elderly would congregate at the park to play pinochle. For the younger generation, dances at Eugene Field Park's field house were a common event.Cutler, Irving. The Jews of Chicago: From Shtetl to Suburb, (Google Books link), University of Illinois Press, 1996, pp. 238-242, () (). Many Jewish organizations utilized Eugene Field Park's field house during the Depression years. Some of those groups include: Congregation B'nai Sholom, the Albany Park Hadassah, the Kimball Bryn Mawr Hebrew School, and the National Home for Jewish Children of Denver.Bachrach, section 8, pp. 14-16 (pp. 20-22 of pdf). Additionally, Christian groups used the facilities at the field house as well. Groups such as Ainsile Baptist Church, the Albany Park Presbyterian Church, and others used the field house throughout the 1930s. Other, non-religious, groups used the park's field house during this time too. For example, the 39th Ward Civic Club and Chicago Public Library; and the building was sometimes used by needy families trying to raise funds or by groups holding a benefit such as the Albany Park Employees Association. The Albany Park District fell behind on its bills by 1932 and it became clear that the district, as an independent entity, was not going to survive the lean years of the Great Depression. In 1934 there were 22 separate park districts operating in the city of Chicago. That year, motivated by the fiscal disaster the Depression had brought to many small independent agencies, voters approved the Park Consolidation Act of 1934 and unified all 22 disparate park districts, including the Albany Park District, into the Chicago Park District. The newly formed conglomerate qualified for $82 million in federal funding through the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Public Works Administration (PWA) between 1935 and 1941. These funds allowed extensive improvements throughout the Chicago park system and Eugene Field Park saw many changes in the 1930s and early 1940s. The athletic fields were improved, paths and sidewalks laid, and through a 1941-42 WPA project the river banks were graded, and retaining wall, rip rap, and chain link fence were installed along the river bank.Bachrach, section 7, p. 4 (p. 10 of pdf). It was during this time that the 60 foot tall light tower was erected near the tennis courts. =2000s= In 2001, Albany Park Theater Project, a youth theater ensemble that makes theater based on the stories of people from the Albany Park neighborhood, took residence at the park through the Chicago Park District's Arts Partners in Residence program. In 2008 the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency undertook a two-week project that removed 1400 cubic feet of illegally dumped concrete, asphalt and shingles in a half-acre section of the park. =2010s= Beginning in April 2011 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers undertook a project intended to restore the degraded river habitats. The project aimed to restore wetland and oak savanna habitats around the river, including the removal of invasive species such as cottonwood trees. The $1.5 million project is slated for completion in September 2015.\\"Eugene Field\\", U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District, accessed March 7, 2015.Eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) is one of the largest North American hardwood trees, a native Chicago species classified under Elm-Ash-Cottonwood ecosystem riparian zones.Populus sect. Aigeiros =Flooding= The area around Eugene Field Park has been subject to flooding over the years; floods struck the area in 2008 and 2013. As early as the 1930s, residents in Albany Park and nearby North Park requested help due to flooding. In 1940-41 a WPA project undertaken by the city attempted to alleviate flooding by dredging the riverbed, regrading the river banks and laying a V-shaped concrete channel in the river bed. The work extended from the North Shore Channel to the pedestrian bridge in Eugene Field Park.Bachrach, section 8 p. 16 (p. 22 of pdf). The National Weather Service (NWS) maintains a river gauge east of the park along Albany Avenue, close to River Park. Of the top ten historical crests for the North Branch Chicago River at the NWS monitoring gauge, seven of them have occurred since 2001. The April 2013 floods, which cancelled 630 flights at O'Hare International Airport and flooded over 1,200 Chicago and suburban basements, set a record for high water at the NWS river gauge near Eugene Field Park. The river reached 8.85 feet on April 18, 2013; Eugene Field Park typically begins to flood when water levels reach 6.0 feet.\\"North Branch Chicago River at Chicago Albany Avenue\\", Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service, National Weather Service, accessed September 7, 2013. The 2013 floods led Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to criticize a previous city plan to alleviate flooding by installing more marshland along the river. Several days after the high water record was set at the Albany Avenue river gauge, Emanuel, Congressman Mike Quigley, Illinois State Senator Ira Silverstein, and other officials gathered at Eugene Field Park to announce a new plan to address flooding in Albany Park. The plan involves sinking a one-mile tunnel beneath Foster Avenue from Eugene Field Park, east, to the North Shore Channel. A pipeline within the tunnel would carry excess water to the channel.Toner, Casey. \\"Emanuel: Planned pipeline aims to pull plug on Northwest Side flooding\\", Chicago Sun-Times, April 21, 2013, accessed September 7, 2013. Facilities The park's tennis courts. The park's tennis courts have been in the same location since c. 1925-1930. North of the five tennis courts is a playground.Staff, \\"Eugene Field Park in midst of EPA cleanup, officials say\\", Chicago Tribune, July 30, 2008, accessed December 1, 2013. Historically, there were two playgrounds divided by an oval path; north of these areas were other recreation features, including a wading pool. During the 1950s the Chicago Park District renovated the playground area and added additional features including an open shelter, a sand court, wading pool and a basketball court. Between 1970 and 1980 the wading pool was converted into a spray feature. The playground equipment and area has had additional updates in the ensuing years. North of the river is a more wide open landscape that features athletic fields used for soccer, football, baseball and softball.Bachrach, section 7, pp. 4-5 (pp. 10-11 of pdf). The park was one of 85 that the Chicago Park District highlighted in a 2008 brochure entitled \\"Nature in the City\\". The brochure noted Eugene Field Park for its access to the natural habitat of the \\"river's edge\\".\\"Nature in the City \\", Chicago Park District, 2008, accessed September 7, 2013. Architecture =Field House= The Tudor Revival field house in 2012. Clarence Hatzfeld designed the brick field house in 1928. It opened to the public in 1930 on a site south of the North Branch of the Chicago River. The building is designed in the Tudor Revival style and includes such stylistic elements as half-timbering, patterned brick and crenellated cornices.Bachrach, section 7, pp. 1-2 (pp. 7-8 of pdf. The field house interior features terrazzo floors. In the auditorium are original light fixtures and the hallways feature decorative brackets. On the second story there is a marble niche for a drinking fountain. Additionally, the second floor houses two noteworthy paintings. There is a painting of Eugene Field that dates to 1941 and has the signature of its artist Joshua Holland. The other important painting is a mural that dates to the WPA time period entitled The Participation of Youth in the Realm of Fine Arts. The mural is believed to have been created by students in a Chicago Park District art class. The paintings were restored between 2001 and 2006 by the Chicago Conservation Center.Bachrach, section 7, p. 3 (p. 9 of pdf).\\"Major Mural Contracts \\", Chicago Conservation Center, official site, accessed September 7, 2013. Directly in front of the field house is a circular driveway that dates to the 1930s, possibly earlier. This circular driveway connects with Ridgeway Avenue. In the past there was a fountain in the grassy \\"island\\" in the middle of the driveway. No longer extant, the fountain has been replaced by ornamental trees and several large boulders. =Landscape= Henry J. Stockmans drafted the original plans for Eugene Field Park. In addition to designing the field house, Hatzfeld also contributed recommendations about the development of the park. Stockmans' original plans no longer exist but in general his design philosophy followed the \\"naturalistic\\" tendencies of Jens Jensen. Jensen was superintendent of the West Chicago Parks Commission while Stockmans worked as foreman for that park district's landscape department during the early 1900s. Both men had worked together when they were among a group that advised the Horticultural Society of Chicago concerning the decor for their annual flower show. =Light tower and footbridges= The 60 foot tall light tower is still in use. The 2003 Carmen Avenue Connector pedestrian bridge. Eugene Field Park features a 60-foot flood light tower. The light tower was installed in 1937 by the Chicago Park District to provide lighting to recreation facilities northwest of the field house and south of the river. The tower is still in use. Until the 1980s there was a flag pole and World War I memorial in the park to the west of the flood light tower. After it fell into disrepair the park district demolished the memorial. There are two bridges within park boundaries. A footbridge over the Chicago River was designed by Hatzfeld in 1927 and opened in 1928. The original footbridge featured an arched wooden deck with metal support beams. Its original X-shaped rails were constructed from rough hewn lumber and at both the north and south ends of the bridge were covered shelters. When the Chicago Park District significantly rebuilt and altered the bridge in 1942, they kept the shelters intact. It is not known when the shelters were removed from the site. The park district undertook extensive reconstruction of the bridge again in 1995. While the original steel structure was maintained, the deck was replaced with asphalt and the railing replaced with chain link fencing. The park's second bridge was constructed by the Chicago Park District in 2003. The historic hedge-lined double-oval pathway in the eastern part of the park was removed to make way for the new bridge.Bachrach, section 7, pp. 3-4 (pp. 9-10 of pdf). The new bridge, known as the Carmen Avenue Connector, joined a bicycle trail system that linked open spaces along the Chicago River, including River and Kiwanis Park east of Eugene Field and Gompers Park to the west. The Carmen Avenue Connector was, in part, funded through a grant from the State of Illinois. Issued in 1997 by then Governor Jim Edgar, the grant included $180,000 for the construction of the bridge as part of the Grand Illinois Trail.Husar, John. \\"Lakefront perch master Ken Schneider reports guards at the...\\" \\"Woods and Waters\\", Chicago Tribune, July 20, 1997, accessed September 7, 2013.

His 1971 monograph Nomenclator Generum et Familiarum Diplopodorum is credited as launching the \\"modern era\\" of millipede taxonomy, and has been considered the \\"most important single work ever published on the Diplopoda\\". He served as director of the Zoological Museum Amsterdam, and authored over 150 works on the taxonomy of millipedes and other myriapods. Biography Jekel was born in 1922 in Medan, on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, and his family moved back to the Netherlands when he was still young. His publications began in 1950, with a pair of papers on millipedes from Suriname. The following year he published a study of the genus Tectoporus (Paradoxosomatidae) and described a new species of Sphaeropoeus (Zephroniidae); both works were praised by colleague Richard L. Hoffman, the former as setting a standard in generic revision, and both of which influenced Hoffman's own work.Hoffman, R. L. (1953). Studies on Spirostreptoid Millipeds. I. The Genus Isoporostreptus Silvestri. Lloydia, 16(2), 149‚Äì156. During the 1960s Jeekel worked at the Zoological Museum Amsterdam and was librarian for the Netherlands Entomological Society. He studied at the University of Amsterdam and his doctoral thesis, published in 1968, concerned the classification and geographic distribution of the Paradoxosomatidae, a large family of millipedes. In 1969 he assumed the position of director of the Zoological Museum, a move which \\"greatly improved his standard of living, but at the expense of his research and health\\". In 1971, he published the Nomenclator Generum et Familiarum Diplopodorum, a taxonomic listing of all known millipede genera and families described between 1758 and 1957; a hugely influential work credited with starting the \\"modern era\\" of millipede taxonomy. Hoffman characterized the Nomenclator as \\"the most important single work ever published on the Diplopoda\\". Throughout his career, Jeekel published more than 150 works, the majority of them as sole author. Jeekel also made major contributions to the taxonomy of Australian millipedes, with 25 articles in his \\"Millipedes from Australia\\" series. In 1999 he established the Myriapod Memoranda, a series of publications to which he often contributed review articles. Jeekel also made a modest contribution to mycology, the study of fungi, when in 1959 he described a new species of fungus in the genus Laboulbenia that parasitizes carabid beetles. PRIVATE In 1998 he transcribed and \\"published\\" a part of the massive collection of letters of his Great- Uncle, the Dutch-Australian artist Jan Hendrik Scheltema (1861-1941) and deposited same in the RKD in The Hague.

It has a tilting cab and is of a distinct shape, which survived into the twenty-first century with China's Sinotruk. In 1978 the facelifted Steyr 91 replaced the 90, and it was in turn replaced by the redesigned Steyr 92 in 1986. Considering its comparatively low production numbers an unusually wide range of models and configurations were available, necessitated by Steyr's dominance of the Austrian truck market in the period - in 1980 about 35% of trucks on the roads there were made by Steyr. Steyr 90 The 90 series was a result of Steyr's failure to link up with another European truck manufacturer. Instead they chose to go it alone, and developed the new Typ 160 cabin design to replace the outmoded, bonneted 680-880 series. The cabin is very distinct, being of an angular design with very large glass surfaces. Good visibility helped promote sales for use in construction and distribution. Other distinctions were the asymmetric radiator opening (a feature which was to last until the end of Steyr truck production) and a standard roof hatch. The cab was not of a tilting design, rather it had a large front opening through which maintenance could be carried out. A large range of engines and layouts were available, including all-wheel drive models (from 1969). Later, a sleeper cab was also added. The engines used are of Steyr's own manufacture, and are all diesels. These were 6.0 or 8.1 litre sixes, as well as a 12-litre V8, and were also available turbocharged. The V8, which was first shown in 1971, was the only one of the 90 range to be equipped with a tilting cabin. The 6.6 litre WD 612 engine was added in 1976. In 1969 the smaller 590/690 range was added, using a modified Hanomag-Henschel cab. This range lasted until 1982, when a smaller-engined version of the 91 series replaced it. The 90 series names were of either three or four digits, with the first one or two denoting the payload in tons and the last two being \\"90\\". The range was from 790 to the four-axle 1890. Only about 50 of the 1890 were built, specifically for the Swiss market which had special requirements for maximum weight per axle.  Steyr 91 The modernized Steyr 91 series replaced the \\"90\\" beginning in 1978. It was now of a tilt-cab design (not for the lighter models) and received a plastic grille and front bumper. The cabin was better insulated, and thus quieter and warmer than earlier models. The four- axle models sold better than those in the 90 series, as they were now offered in several markets aside from Switzerland and also for heavy construction work. A Steyr 91 built by China National Heavy Duty Truck Group As with its predecessor, the mid-range models were introduced first with heavy and light models added gradually thereafter. Originally it was available with 6.6 or 9.7 litre diesel sixes (WD 612, WD 615) or the 12 litre eight. The lighter duty 591 and 691 models, introduced in 1982, received a detuned version of the 6.6 litre \\"six\\". They had an updated version of the old Hanomag body. A twelve- litre six-cylinder was also developed, but never entered production due to high tooling costs. Later models received another facelift with more plastic cladding and a new grille. The light and medium-duty versions were replaced by the new 92 series cabin beginning in 1986, but heavier duty versions continued to use the Plus series cabin until gradually replaced by MAN's F2000 design beginning in 1994. Steyr's naming practice changed in the 1980s, with the two leading digits denoting the approximate gross weight in tonnes, followed by an \\"S\\" (for civilian), followed by two digits for tens of horsepowers. Thus, the 1291.31 became the 19S31. =Military career= From the all-wheel drive 91, the militarized 91M was also developed. Appearing in 1983, this met with considerable sales success. Aside from Austria, Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Greece also used these. The 1200 vehicles sold to Canada were called \\"Percheron\\" (or UTDC 24M32) and were assembled by local partner UTDC (Can- Car). They entered service there in 1990 after a protracted selection process. It was also manufactured in Greece, where the earlier 680 series was manufactured until the end of 1984. Steyr also entered the US Army's competition for a new Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), a contract they won. The trucks in question have been manufactured in Texas, using Steyr components, including engines and some body panels (actually those from the 92 series). The FMTV has seen service across the globe, with a number of countries' armed forces.  Steyr 92 The mid-range Steyr 92 received a fully redesigned robot-built cabin, much more aerodynamic with rounded corners. It still retained some Steyr characteristics such as the offset grille opening and large glazing, although by now these features were more common. It was introduced in the spring of 1986 but only replaced the lighter and medium parts of the range. Heavier and articulated trucks retained the 91 series cab. The military 12M18 truck also uses the 92's cabin, as does the FMTV of the US Army. A civilian version of the 12M18 is also made, called the 12S18. Steyr's biggest markets at this time, aside from Austria, were Greece and Switzerland. At the time of introduction, only an updated version of the smaller WD 612, a diesel inline-six, were available. Turbocharged and intercooled versions were also available, meaning that outputs of 136, 177, or 210 PS were available. Steyr 13S23 fire engine (Austria) FMTV in use with the Thai armed forces during the floods of 2011 The naming of the 92 series (also adapted for later models of the 91) refers to the vehicle's gross weight, followed by an \\"S\\" or \\"M\\" for civilian or military versions, followed by a number denoting tens of horsepower. Thus, a 210 PS 16-ton model would be called 16S21. Lighter models used Steyr's own transmissions, while heavier versions received ZF units. The axles were all Steyr's own, axles being a mainstay of Steyr's production. The 92 series cab was also used by Britain's ERF beginning in the late 1980s, for their medium-weight ES series. Coincidentally, ERF became part of MAN in 2000.

D-Rev‚Äôs products include the ReMotion Knee, a polycentric prosthetic knee for above-the-knee amputees, and Brilliance, a phototherapy device for treating neonatal jaundice. D-Rev products have been sold in 73 countries including India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Nigeria, Botswana, Senegal, South Africa, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Fiji, Indonesia, and Iraq. Business model D-Rev is a 501(c)(3) organization that researches, designs, and develops products and then works with in-country partners such as Phoenix Medical Systems and Puspadi Bali to deliver products. D-Rev products are purchased by buyers directly, such as ministries of health, clinics, doctors, or hospitals. Philanthropic donations to D-Rev facilitate product design, field work, supply chain and distribution planning, R&D;, product marketing, and operations costs. Products Brilliance Brilliance is a phototherapy device that treats neonatal Jaundice, or hyperbilirubinemia, a medical condition that affects 60% of newborns worldwide, 16.5% of whom suffer from severe that can lead to brain damage, nervous system damage (kernicterus), and death. Jaundice can be treated through phototherapy, which breaks down the excess bilirubin in a jaundiced newborn‚Äôs blood. Brilliance uses high-intensity blue light-emitting diode () lights rather than the fluorescent tube lights used in traditional phototherapy devices. Brilliance LEDs last for ten years without needing replacement, while compact fluorescent light bulbs need to be replaced every four to six months. Brilliance is designed to help hospitals by eliminating the need for bulb replacements ‚Äì saving hospitals money on compact fluorescent tube lights, and eliminating gaps in effective treatment caused by bulb supply. Tests at Stanford School of Medicine show that Brilliance performs on par or better than traditional Western phototherapy devices. Brilliance is priced to sell for $400 (22,000 INR). ReMotion Knee The ReMotion Knee, previously the JaipurKnee, is a prosthetic knee joint for above-knee amputees. The JaipurKnee was developed by students at Stanford University in 2009. The student project worked with the Jaipur Foot Organization or Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samiti, Jaipur (BMVSS) to develop a low-cost knee joint to be used at BMVSS clinics in India and temporary fitting camps around the world. A group of Stanford University students started ReMotion, an independent company to pursue the design and distribution of the prosthetic knee joint. D-Rev acquired ReMotion and all of its IP in 2012. Amputees were first fit with the ReMotion Knee in May 2013. The ReMotion Knee weighs 0.88 lb/400g and is produced using injection molding, allowing for centralized manufacturing and a slimmer device profile. The ReMotion Knee has a projected retail price of $80 USD. Impact D-Rev released its impact dashboards in June 2014. Reflecting a strong industry emphasis on measuring impact of social entrepreneurship, D-Rev designed and implemented impact measurement tools and tracking for each device. Brilliance As of June 30, 2020, D-Rev reports that more than 900,000 babies have been treated with Brilliance devices. ReMotion Knee As of June 30, 2020, 777 amputees have been fit with the ReMotion Knee.

The test is comprehensive and covers‚Äîin equal proportions‚Äîmolecular biology, organismal biology, and ecology and evolution. This exam, like all the GRE subject tests, is paper-based, as opposed to the GRE general test which is usually computer-based. It contains 194 questions, which are to be answered within 2 hours and 50 minutes. Scores on this exam are required for entrance to some biology Ph.D. programs in the United States. Scores are scaled and then reported as a number between 200 and 990; however, in recent versions of the test, the maximum and minimum reported scores have been 940 (corresponding to the 99 percentile) and 400 (1 percentile) respectively. The mean score for all test takers from July, 2009, to July, 2012, was 658 with a standard deviation of 123.

Description International Polar Bear Day is organized by Polar Bears International to raise awareness about the impact of global warming and reduced sea ice on polar bear populations. The day encourages people to find ways to reduce their carbon output, such as by turning down their thermostat or driving less. The day has also been used to encourage the installation of energy efficient insulation in houses. So save the polar bears they may be extinct in 2100 Observance Many zoos use the day to educate about polar bear conservation and to encourage visitation to polar bear exhibits. It has also had some political impact. Jack Shapiro, the deputy climate campaign manager under American president Barack Obama, used the day to argue for the need for Congressional action on the issue of climate change. The University of Saskatchewan announced in 2014 that it would be turning its thermostats up two degrees in the summer and down two degrees Celsius in the winter to honor International Polar Bear Day. The decision is expected to reduce the university's carbon emissions by two-thousand tons and save the university over two-hundred thousand dollars per year.

However, due to the complex geology of the collection site, its actual age is somewhere between Early Miocene and Late Pliocene. History The penguin was described by Brian Marples from fossil material (a fairly complete skeleton) collected by G. Harris in 1955 from Motunau Beach in the Canterbury region of the South Island.

It was first isolated from crude streptovaricin complex produced by Streptomyces spectabilis and presented at the 13th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in Washington, D.C. in September 1973. Spectinabilin is a biologically active compound, exhibiting both antimalarial and antiviral activity.''  Biosynthesis  Production of spectinabilin occurs through a type one polyketide synthase, and is regulated differently in S. spectabilis and Streptomyces orinoci despite being nearly identical gene clusters. The biosynthesis of Spectinabillin initially requires 4 open reading frames (ORF) for the production of the starter unit, p-nitrobenzoic acid (pNBA) from chorismate. pNBA is then loaded onto the polyketide synthase, and undergoes 6 rounds of elongation and reduction. Briefly, pNBA is loaded onto the PKA and elongated by methyl malonyl-coa (mmCoA), which is then reduced twice to afford the enone. This elongation and subsequent reduction is then repeated three additional times with another unit of mmCoA. The final mmCoA loaded in the sequence is completely reduced to saturation. Malonyl CoA (mCoA) is then loaded, followed by two additional units of mmCoA. Then, the previously loaded mCoA cyclizes with the most recently loaded mmCoA as a result of the terminal thioesterase(TE) domain to form a 6 membered terminal ring of the spectinabillin intermediate. The alcohol of the ring is then methylated. A furan is then formed via oxidation and subsequent cyclization catalyzed by a Cyt p-450 monoxygenase to afford spectinabillin. Proposed biosynthetic route to Spectinabilin. mmCoA: methylmalonyl-Coa, mCoA: Malonyl-CoA. Spn proteins assigned possible function according to their homology to proteins of known function.

Small, a researcher and lecturer at the Centre for Islamic Studies and Muslim‚ÄìChristian Relations at the London School of Theology. Content The book is an application of \\"reasoned eclecticism\\" to a small portion of the Quran: 14:35‚Äì41. The book contains four parts: :1) chapters 1&2 covering the introduction and photographs and descriptions of the manuscripts used; :2) chapters 3-8 describing the textual variants in the manuscripts; :3) chapters 9-11 include comparisons of these variants with Islamic records of variants, discussing possible causes, including unintentional mistakes in oral transmission or intentional changes; :4) a concluding, twelfth chapter. Small concludes that a critical text of the Quran cannot currently be constructed. He says, > \\"...the available sources do not provide the necessary information for > reconstructing the original text of the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn from the time of Muhammad. > Neither do they yet provide the necessary information for reconstructing the > text from the time immediately after Muhammad's death until the first > official edition of the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn traditionally ordered by the Caliph ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn\\". He states \\"there never was one original text of the Qur'an\\", that the Uthmanic destruction of variant texts around 850 CE, eliminated \\"many texts which had equally good claims to containing authentic readings\\", that before the three century-long \\"process of development and improvement\\" to standardize the Quran phonetically, there were \\"50 different ways\\" of reciting the Quran. Fred Donner interprets Small's work as showing \\"that there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonantal text of the Qur æƒÅn from what was probably a wider and more varied group of related texts in early transmission. [...] After the creation of this standardized canonical text, earlier authoritative texts were suppressed, and all extant manuscripts‚Äîdespite their numerous variants‚Äîseem to date to a time after this standard consonantal text was established.\\" Donner also says though that Small's conclusions are tentative, because analogous work on larger passages of the Quran may give different results. Reception Fred Donner of the University of Chicago writes that the book is of \\"manifest excellence and importance\\", with \\"but minor blemishes\\". One fault Donner sees is that Small does not engage with the work of Christoph Luxenberg. Efim Rezvan of the Saint Petersburg State University says that the work is \\"capital\\" and brings \\"new insights to the history of the development of a standardized text of the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn.\\" Marcin Grodzki of the University of Warsaw writes that‚Äîdespite some \\"minor flaws\\"‚ÄîSmall should be congratulated for his work, and that it should be given a \\"prominent place\\" in libraries involved with the history of early Islam and the study of the Quran. One flaw Grodzki sees is that the book does not consider the possibility of the use different alphabets in the initial written transmission of the Quran, such as the use of the Syriac alphabet in Garshuni. Hurtado in his review endorses Small's conclusions. \\"In Small's bold statement, ‚Äòthe history of the transmission of the text of the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn is at least as much a testament to the destruction of Qur‚ÄôƒÅn material as it is to its preservation‚Äô, and ‚Äòis also testimony to the fact that there never was one original text of the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn‚Äô (p. 180). What we have in the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn as transmitted is ‚Äòa text-form that was chosen from amidst a group of others, which was then edited and canonized at the expense of these others, and has been improved upon in order to make it conform to a desired ideal‚Äô (p. 184).\\" ... \\"This is not so totally different from the textual histories of other scriptural texts. And perhaps that is the chief point which emerges from Small's analysis. It is richly documented, informed by other recent scholarship (both traditional Muslim and ‚ÄòWestern‚Äô), eirenic and respectful in tone, and a solid and impressive case for the observations advanced.\\" Notes References  * * External links *Publisher's listing Category:Quranic studies Category:2011 books ","title":"Textual Criticism and Qur ºƒÅn Manuscripts"},{"id":"42839685","text":"Monkey Bay Airport is an airport serving the Lake Malawi port town of Monkey Bay, in the Southern Region of Malawi.

Established in New York City in 1995 as a comprehensive source of sculptural materials and tools, it is one of the largest sculptural materials suppliers in the world. It also provides classes and related services for professional sculptors, as well as other users of sculptural materials, such as movie and television set designers and law enforcement forensic teams.  Background  Marc and Ailene Fields started The Compleat Sculptor as a family business in 1995. The company was founded to supply basic media for sculptors such as clays, various stone materials, and many types of wood, as well as tools needed to work on sculpting materials. The company also began offering product demonstrations and classes: stone carving, wood carving, clay work, wax work, foam sculpting, and multimedia workshops. Robin Finn of The New York Times characterized the store as, \\"...peeling walls, scaly ceilings and scarred linoleum floors. The place is not pretty. But that is not the point. Sculptors and other artisans gather here the way handymen haunt the cobweb-covered aisles of old hardware stores.\\" Since its founding, The Compleat Sculptor has steadily increased its store and catalog product lines, as well as its customer base, making it one of the largest suppliers of its kind in the world.  Products and services  The company's basic stone sculptural materials inventory includes 300 tons of marble, alabaster, granite and soapstone. The store also supplies other sculpting media (clay, cast metal, ceramic, wood, polymers, composite materials and glass) and sculpting tools (chisels, sanders, grinders, polishes). The company maintains a 15,000-item inventory to provide supplies for a diverse clientele. The customer base includes professional sculptors, prop artists for stage and television programs, museum conservators, archaeologists, law enforcement needing media for crime-scene restorations and ballistics molds, and first responders creating fake wounds for triage training, as well as arts and crafts clients. Company services include finishing and polishing stone sculptures, kiln firing clay sculptures, foundry services for bronze castings, resin formulations, and mounting and shipping services for finished works. The company custom-designs some rasps and resins, and has also ventured into product prototyping for architectural businesses, including reproduction of bricks, architectural details, and decorative elements in new construction or building restoration.

The attack The Indian consulate in Herat, Afghanistan was attacked around 3:15 a.m. on 23 May 2014 by four heavily armed militants. The attackers were armed with machine guns, rocket- propelled grenades, hand grenades and suicide vests. They opened fire from a nearby home. All the attackers were killed during a lengthy gun battle, two by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and others by the Afghan security forces.Indian consulate attacked in Afghanistan, The Guardian, 23 May 2014.Indian consulate in Herat, Afghanistan attacked, BBC News, 23 May 2014. No one in the consulate's staff was injured. A squad of 23 ITBP personnel was guarding the consulate. The consulate, located in central Herat, enjoys extensive protection comparable only to the U.S. consulate in the city. It has at least three layers of security, and visitors must walk 200 m to reach it as the road leading to it is barricaded. No group claimed responsibility for the attack. Analysis On 25 May, the Afghan president Hamid Karzai informed Indian media that the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistani terrorist organisation with links to the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI, was responsible for the attack. Indian security agencies also agreed with the assessment. In June, the US State Department came out with its own assessment that the LeT was responsible for the attacks and redesignated LeT as a terrorist organisation.LeT responsible for attack at Indian consulate in Herat: US, The Hindu, 26 June 2014. After a symbolic ban by President Musharraf, the LeT had renamed itself Jamat ud Dawa and begun posing as a charity.Pakistani charity is a terror front which attacked Indian consulate, says US, The Telegraph, 26 June 2014. According to American South Asia analyst Bruce Riedel, the LeT had planned to take Indian diplomats hostage and execute them just as Narendra Modi was taking office. Their goal was, according to Riedel, to discredit Pakistan's own Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was due to attend Modi's inaugural ceremony. This was meant to be payback to Sharif for having put the former army dictator Pervez Musharraf on trial for treason.Bruce Riedel, Nuclear Pakistan‚Äôs Spies Target India‚Äîand Their Own Prime Minister, The Daily Beast/Brookings Institution, 4 September 2014. The Diplomat reported a Pakistani security expert stating that the timing of the attack was related to the swearing-in ceremony of Narendra Modi. There were said to be forces in Pakistan that were agitated about any bonhomie with the BJP leader as they see him as an enemy.Why Was India's Herat Consulate Attacked?, The Diplomat, 24 May 2014. Reactions Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai spoke to India's Prime Minister designate Narendra Modi after the attack and called it \\"an attack on Afghanistan, India and our shared interests\\". Narendra Modi condemned the attack and assured support to Amar Sinha, the Indian ambassador to Afghanistan.

He is a Professor at the Department of Management, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. He is also Director, International Consortium for Research in Employment & Work (iCREW), Centre for Global Business, Monash Business School.  Early life and education Bamber was born near Kingston upon Thames, Greater London, in the United Kingdom (UK). His parents were Douglas Bamber (1921-91) and Elizabeth Bamber (n√©e Dawson, 1922-2009). They had English, Irish and Scottish ancestry and among other jobs, both worked as teachers. Bamber attended several schools in Surrey and Cheshire, UK and also for a year in Massachusetts, USA. His post-school education was in the UK at the University of Manchester, the London School of Economics and Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh.  Career In his early career, Bamber worked on research projects based at several UK universities (Imperial College, London; Oxford University; and Warwick University), in industry, at the UK Government‚Äôs former Commission on Industrial Relations and as an arbitrator with its successor, the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. He has helped to lead many competitive grant-funded research projects funded by the Australian Research Council and the UK Economic and Social Research Council. International agencies and enterprises have commissioned Bamber to conduct research projects and act as an advisor on human resources and industrial relations. He has been a visitor at Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, as well as Cardiff University, Wales; he is Visiting Professor, Newcastle University, England.  Contributions Some of Bamber‚Äôs writing is controversial. He argues in favour of employee engagement in workplace decisions. In an influential book on airlines, he and his colleagues show that this is an effective strategy, for instance, when managing organizational change. They point to such successful instances as Southwest Airlines in the US and EasyJet in the UK. However, others reject such arguments and promote instead a tougher more autocratic and adversarial approach to managing organizational change, pointing to the way in which Ryanair changed civil aviation in Ireland and Europe and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation changed newspaper publishing in Australia, the UK and the USA. His contributions to the fields of comparative management and employment relations are well regarded. The book by him and colleagues that was first published in 1987 is seen as \\"the standard work\\", which is used around the world on University courses on International and Comparative Employment Relations.  Expert comment Bamber is recognised as an expert in the fields of management, human resources and industrial relations in aviation, health care, manufacturing and other sectors. He is a regular commentator in the electronic and printed mass media, especially in Australia and also in the UK.  Honours and recognition Bamber has served as President of Australia and New Zealand Academy of Management (ANZAM), International Federation of Scholarly Associations of Management, Industrial Relations Society of Victoria (Australia) and the Association of Industrial Relations Academics of Australia & New Zealand. He has served as a Director on several boards in the fields of education, healthcare, industrial relations and sport, as well as on more than 20 editorial boards for international journals. In 2012 Bamber was awarded the esteemed title of Academician (Fellow) of the Academy of Social Sciences (AcSS) UK. > \\"Professor Bamber's inclusion in this elite group of academics is testament > to his excellence in the field of research and academia.

George William Balfour, portrait by John Dick Bowie The grave of Dr George William Balfour, Colinton Churchyard Life Born at the manse of Sorn, Ayrshire, on 2 June 1823, he was sixth son and eighth of the thirteen children of Rev Lewis Balfour DD (1777-1860), by his wife Henrietta Scott, third daughter of George Smith, D.D., minister of Galston; James Balfour was a brother, Thomas Stevenson was a brother-in-law, and Robert Louis Stevenson was a nephew. After education at Colinton, he planned first to study veterinary science and settle in Australia; but entered the Medical School of Edinburgh. In 1845 he graduated M.D. at the University of St. Andrews, and was licensed by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. After acting as house surgeon to the Edinburgh Royal Maternity Hospital, Balfour in 1846 went to Vienna, where he studied under Joseph ≈†koda, Carl Ludwig Sigmund, and Wilhelm Fleischmann the homeopath. Balfour was a general practitioner in Midlothian from 1846 till 1857, when he returned to Edinburgh, and practised as a physician on becoming F.R.C.P. Edinburgh in 1861. In 1866 he was appointed physician to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, and from 1867 he was physician to the Royal Infirmary, being appointed consulting physician in 1882, on the expiry of his term of office. During this time he was a lecturer in medicine at the Edinburgh Extramural School of Medicine. Balfour specialised in diseases of the heart and circulation, and became a leading figure of his time in this area together with Sir William Tennant Gairdner in Glasgow, and Charles Hilton Fagge in London. He was librarian to the College of Physicians of Edinburgh from 1873 to 1882 and from 1887 to 1899. He was president of the college 1882-4, and was a member of the University Court of St. Andrews for many years. He received the honorary degree of LL.D. at Edinburgh in 1884, and at St. Andrews in 1896. He was appointed physician in ordinary to Queen Victoria in 1900 and honorary physician to King Edward VII in 1901. In 1899 Balfour retired from the town centre of Edinburgh to live in Colinton, on the south-west outskirts of the city, where he died on 9 August 1903. He is buried in the Balfour vault on the north side of Colinton Parish Church. His obituary was written by his colleague James Ormiston Affleck. Works On his return from Austria, in 1846, Balfour published papers on \\"The Treatment of Pneumonia as practised by Skoda\\";Northern Journal of Medicine, Jan. 1846, p. 55 \\"Necrosis of the Jaw induced by Phosphorus as taught by Sigmund\\";Northern Journal of Medicine, May 1846, p. 284 and \\"The Hom≈ìopathic Treatment of Acute Diseases by Fleischmann\\".British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review, Oct. 1846, p. 567 For the New Sydenham Society he translated (1861-5) the Hand-book of the Practice of Forensic Medicine, by Johann Ludwig Casper. In 1865 he published An Introduction to the Study of Medicine. In 1868, following a suggestion of his father-in-law, Dr. James Craig of Ratho, he wrote two papers on \\"The Treatment of Aneurysm by Iodide of Potassium\\". His standing as a cardiologist rested on Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Heart and Aorta (1876) and The Senile Heart (1894). Family Balfour married three times: # in 1848 to Agnes (d. 1851), daughter of George Thomson, by whom he had one son, Lewis; # in 1854 to Margaret Bethune (d. 1879), eldest daughter of Dr. James Craig, of Ratho, by whom he had eight sons and three daughters; and # in 1881 to Henrietta, daughter of John Usher, who survived him.

Creating circuits with the inverted behaviour to the amplifier is one way to implement this concept. These circuits counteract the non-linearities of the amplifier and minimize the distortion of the signal. This increases linear operating range up to the saturation (maximum output power) of the amplifier. Linearized amplifiers have a significantly higher efficiency with improved signal quality. There are different concepts to linearize an amplifier, including pre- and post-distortion and feedback linearization. Most commonly used is pre-distortion linearization. The function performed by the linearizer in relation to the amplifier is very similar to that of eyeglasses in relation to the eye. The eye distorts the image seen; the glasses pre-distort the image. When these two distortions are combined, the result is a clear image. For the nearsighted, the glasses must pre-distort the image one way. For the farsighted, the image must be pre-distorted in the opposite way.  Functionality of Pre-distortion Linearizers  Non-linearities occur in amplifiers due to decreasing amplification and changing phase when operated near saturation. This behavior is commonly referred to as gain or phase compression. The pre-distortion linearizer is designed to compensate these changes. The resulting behavior is commonly referred to as gain or phase expansion. A pre-distortion linearizer works by creating signal distortion (amplitude and phase) that is the complement of the signal distortion inherent in the High-Powered Amplifier. The signal to be amplified is first passed through the linearizer, distorting the signal, with no loss in gain. The distorted signal is then fed to the High-Powered Amplifier to be amplified. The distortion inherent in the High-Powered Amplifier negates the distortion introduced by the linearizer producing a near linear transfer characteristic. Fig. 1: Gain plotted against input power Figure 1 shows the amplification (gain) contingent upon input power. The gain compression of the amplifier starts above a certain input power level (red curve). By adding a pre- distortion linearizer (blue curve) in front of the amplifier, the gain compression effect is compensated up to a certain power level (green curve). The point where the gain of the total system is starting to drop off is pushed to a higher power level thereby increasing the linear operating range. In practice, the linear output power level of an amplifier increases significantly (up to four times). Fig. 2: Output Power contingent upon input power The increased linear operating range is also illustrated in Figure 2 (light blue area). The chart shows the relationship between input and output power of an amplifier with and without pre-distortion linearizer. The dotted line shows the output power of the amplifier as a function of the input power on a logarithmic scale. In this illustration the compression is shown as the deviation from the ideal 45¬∞ line. The amplifier with pre-distortion linearizer (solid line) deviates from the ideal line at a much higher power level. The light blue area illustrates the improved linear operating power range gained by adding a pre-distortion linearizer.  Advantages of Pre- distortion Linearizers  Pre-distortion linearizers operate in the small signal area and increase the DC power consumption of the system only marginally. Additional advantages can be deduced including: * Small foot print, low weight. * Low cost solution compared to use of higher power amplifier in similar linear operating range. * Lower environmental impact through improved efficiency. * Retrofit possible * Adjustment to different amplifier types possible * Highly reliable  Typical Properties of a Pre- distortion Linearizer  * Dimensions: Dependent on design in the range of a few cm * Weight: 20g to 200g depending on features * Frequencies: 1 to 50 GHz with different bandwidths * Expansion levels:  Gain: up to 10 dB, dependent on amplifier data  Phase: up to 60¬∞  Applications  The preferred application of linearizers is in high power amplifiers using electron tubes (traveling wave tubes, Klystron tubes, magnetron tubes) or solid state amplifiers (GaN, GaAs, Si). These systems are used in broadband voice and data transfer applications including Satellite Communication, Broadband Internet, or HD/3D television. These applications require high signal quality. The optimization of the amplifier characteristics enables the ideal use of available power and leads to energy savings of up to 50%.

An annular cutter cuts only a groove at the periphery of the hole and leaves a solid core or slug at the center.Metal Cutting Theory and Practice. David A. Stephenson, John S. AgapiouCRC Press, 02.12.2005. Page number 216. An annular cutter is a more expensive and more efficient alternative to spiral drill bits and standard hole saws. An annular cutter is similar to a hole saw but differs in geometry and material. The two most common types are high-speed steel (HSS) and tungsten carbide tipped (TCT). Like a hole saw, but unlike a spiral drill bit, an annular cutter cuts only the periphery of a hole, leaving a circular \\"slug\\" at the center. Annular cutters are available from 12 mm (1/2‚Äô‚Äô) diameter to 200 mm (7 7/8‚Äô‚Äô) and larger. Depths of 30 mm, 55 mm, 75 and 110 mm are commonly available. A Magnetic Drilling Machine From BDS Maschinen GmbH (Germany) Using TCT Annular Cutter of 110 mm Cutting Length. Annular cutters are best used with a drill press or magnetic drilling machine, both for their stability against high torque forces created by such a drill bit and lower RPMs compared to other types of drills.  History  A magnetic drilling machine fitted with an annular cutter The annular cutter was patented in 1973. The high-speed steel type was patented 1983,United States Patent. Patent number 4516890. Filed 12.09.1983. USA. and tungsten carbide tipped in 1985.United Kingdom Patent. Patent number 2167983-A. Filed 31.10.1985. UK.  Benefits  A perfect 14 mm diameter hole made by a TCT annular cutter = Time saving = As an annular cutter cuts only on the periphery of the hole to be made, it has to remove much less material as compared to conventional drill bits which cut and remove the complete material of the hole. Annular cutters are considered to be 3 to 4 times faster than conventional drill bits. Also while using a twist drill bit or metal hole saw one has to do pre-drilling and step-drilling operations for bigger diameter holes, whereas an annular cutter requires no pre-drilling and step-drilling. It is a one-shot drilling operation. The annular cutters have fewer teeth and less wear, therefore with an annular cutter holes can be made at higher or faster cutting speed and a faster feed rate of the drilling machine. = Energy savings= Because annular cutters do not have to drill/cut through the complete work piece, they require less thrust and thus less energy to drill through material. = More finishing = The hole made using an annular cutter is more finished, precise and accurate. = Easy = Due to the unique geometry of the annular cutters, making holes at awkward angles is also very easy. = Efficient cooling = The cooling of annular cutters is internal. The internal lubrication is provided through a hole with the help of a pilot pin. Internal lubrication makes the annular cutter faster and more efficient for deep hole drilling. = Best for light duty machines = As the annular cutters require very low RPM (from min 50 RPM), these cutters can be easily used with light duty drilling machines or portable magnetic base drilling machines. 150 mm dimater X 55 mm length TCT Core Drill = Sizes = Annular cutters biggest advantage is the variety of sizes. Annular cutters start from 12 mm diameter up to 150 mm diameter and more if required. Various cutting depth (length) of annular cutters can be sourced depending upon the requirement. = Re-sharpening = HSS annular cutter can be easily re-sharpened on a grinding machine and can be re-used for drilling. Re-grinding can be done until the desired cutting length is available on the annular cutter.  Types HSS core drill with Hard Coating for more heat resistance and longer life time. The types of core drills are categorized by the material used to manufacture them: Primarily a metal core drill is made from High Speed Steel and Tungsten Carbide Tips. So commercially the types of core drills are HSS core drills and TCT core drills. = High-speed steel (HSS) = HSS core drills are made from high-speed steel material. These are most popular core drills or annular cutters in market. HSS core drills are cheaper for smaller diameter i.e. 40 mm. The biggest advantage of HSS core drill is its ability to re-sharpen. Unlike TCT core drills, HSS core drills re-sharpened and used with good efficiency until the desirable length is remaining. HSS core drills have longer service life, high heat resistance: the characteristics of HSS core drills is that drilling with these core drills can be done without the use of excessive force.  Standard  The HSS Standard core drills are made from M2 steel. These core drills are one of the most popular core drills in western countries due to its cost and resharpening advantage. The Standard HSS core drills are used to drill Mild and Structural steel, Aluminium, Stainless steel of lower BHN., etc.  Cobalt  The HSS Cobalt are core drills made from M42 Steel. These core drills have 8% Cobalt in HSS. These core drills are harder than the Standard HSS core drills which gives better performance to drill harder material. A high percentage of Cobalt in HSS makes it faster, stronger and durable. Cobalt HSS core drills are used to drill materials like Structural Steel, Stainless Steel, Cast iron, etc.  Hard coating  The HSS core drills with Hard Coating are core drills with a coating on it, generally TiN Coating. This make the core drills more resistant to heat, longer tool life and even removal of chips. These core drills are gaining lot of popularity over the Standard HSS core drills these days. These core drills are used Structural steel, Stainless steel, etc. = Tungsten carbide tipped (TCT) = Tungsten carbide tipped (TCT) core drills have tungsten carbide on their tips, a very hard material suitable for cutting through tougher materials. TCT core drills are more expensive than HSS core drills but are faster and more efficient making larger holes. TCT core drills are cheaper for bigger diameter i.e. above 41 mm. Tip breakage is more likely than with HSS core bits, and TCT bits may not be resharpened.  Standard  A Standard TCT core drill has tungsten carbide tips. These types of core drills are now available in vast range of diameter, for up to 150 mm. These are popularly used core drills on magnetic core drilling machines. These core drills are popularly used to drill materials like railway tracks, structural steel, stainless steel, cast iron, etc.  Hard coating  The TCT core drills with Hard Coating are core drills with a coating on it, generally TiN Coating. This make the core drills more resistant to heat, longer tool life and even removal of chips just like the advantage of HSS core drill. The biggest advantage of hard coated core drills is that these cutters are very good for cutting larger diameters on hard material. These core drills are popularly used to drill materials like corroded or weathered material, structural and stainless steel.  Shanks  = Weldon = \\"Weldon shank\\" annular cutters have 2 flats and this is the traditional method adopted by many of the popular magnetic drill manufacturers. \\"Weldon shank\\" annular cutters fix in the chuck by tightening grub screws in the two flat areas. = Universal = \\"Universal shank\\" annular cutters has one flat and three quick connect grooves. This is also a popular method for using annular cutters into mag drills quickly, without any strain of tightening grub screws. mostly \\"universal shank cutters\\" can be used in \\"weldon -shank machines, where as weldon-shank annular cutters can't use in \\"one-touch\\" machines without the help of an extra adapter. while using \\"universal shank cutters\\" into \\"weldon shank\\" machines, the tightening area (flat area) is only one, which is also not 100% sufficient to tighten the both screws. Drilling tubes and pipes  Drilling on tube/pipe with a BDS magnetic drilling machine and an annular cutter along with a tube attachment. Annular cutters can also be best used to make holes in pipes and tubes. Annular cutters help make holes in pipe and tubes without dimpling and deburring. Unlike the conventional method of bringing the workpiece to machine, with the help of portable magnetic core drilling machines, you can now bring the machine to the workpiece. This makes the drilling process on tubes very easy. To make a hole in tube or pipe easily an annular cutter should be used with a magnetic base drilling machine and a tube/pipe clamping device. The tube clamping device is a metallic device which is clamped on the tube with an adjustable chain. After clamping the device the magnetic drilling machine is placed on the device, which gets clamped to the device by switching on its magnet. With the help of magnetic drilling machines' proper RPM the annular cutter makes a perfect hole in the tube. Generally a HSS annular cutter is used to make holes in tubes and pipes, as the TCT annular cutters has more chances of cutting teeth breakage due to curved surfaces of tubes and pipes. As annular cutters are hollow there is no dead zone resistance. The cutting takes place only on the periphery of the hole to be made. Annular cutters distribute load equally on the periphery of the hole with its multiple cutting edges, thus the required thrust and energy is also much less comparatively.  Comparison between HSS and TCT core drills  HSS Core Drills in various sizes TCT Core Drills in various sizes = Cost = HSS core drills are cheaper than the TCT core drills for smaller diameters up to 40 mm, while TCT core drills are cheaper than HSS for diameters above 41 mm. = Re-sharpening = Once the HSS cutter loses its sharpness, it can be re-ground on a grinding machine and can be used again. While, re-grinding the TCT core drill is possible but very difficult and time consuming. = Defect = The chances of defect in TCT core drills is more because the tungsten carbide tips are glued on the core drill and when the core drill falls down or crashes on the material, the chances tip breakage is more. HSS cutter on the other hand are completely made out of one material. = Speed = TCT cutter biggest advantage is speed and ease in which it may cut harder materials. Especially for larger diameter TCT core drills are very successful. While HSS core drills are good when drilling not very hard material and for small diameter hole sizes. = Hardness = The teeth on TCT core drills are harder than HSS, allowing them to cut more difficult materials.  Advantages of annular cutters over conventional twist drill bits  Comparison diagram for twist drills and annular cutters Annular cutters have several advantages over conventional twist drill bits: = Less power / Less effort = The conventional twist drill has only two cutting edges, while an annular cutter or core drill has multiple cutting edges which helps to drill with much less horsepower and efforts. = Less material to cut = The conventional twist drill being solid and having only cutting point has to cut or remove the complete material of the hole to be made. While with annular cutters or core drills having multiple edges and being hollow cuts only on the periphery of the hole to be made. = Less time needed = As core drill has to cut less material as compared to twist drill, the time required is also too less. A core drill is considered to be 3 to 4 times faster than twist drills. = Lower cost= A single core drill makes 5 to 10 times more holes then a twist drill, plus core drills can be again reground to make another 1500 holes, thus saving a lot of tool cost. = No pre-drilling or step-drilling = Unlike twist drills, core drills even for larger diameters do not require any pre- drilling or step-drilling. Example: To make a 50 mm diameter hole with twist drill, one has to start making a pre-drilling of 10 mm, than 15 mm than 20 mm, ...up to 50 mm slowly increasing the size of holes. While with core drill one can drill directly 50 mm in one-shot. = Higher accuracy = Holes made by core drills have higher accuracy compared to twist drills. = Burr-free holes = One of the biggest advantages of core drills over twist drill is burr-free holes and smooth holes, resulting in less scrap and wastage of material. Disadvantages of core drills The biggest disadvantage of core drill or annular cutter is that it can not drill blind holes. A core drill due to its hollow geometry can only make through holes. Another disadvantage is in drilling a pile of many plates. There are some core drills with a different geometry which can be used for drilling piles of plates, but still it is not 100% successful. The cost of a core drill is high compared to twist drill, but the cost per hole made with core drill is less as compared to twist drills, this is because a single core drill makes 5 to 10 times more holes than a twist drill.  Cooling lubricants  Using lubricant or coolant with any type of annular cutter is a must. A correct lubrication and coolant delivery more life for annular cutters. The very important thing to know is that TCT annular cutters require Coolant, not lubricant and HSS annular cutters required Cutting oil, not coolant. While drilling overhead with liquid lubricants will lead to damage the motor of the machine due to the lubricant entering the motor. Thus high performance cutting paste to drill overhead or in the horizontal situation. This cutting paste is suitable for both HSS and TCT core drills as well as for thread cutting tools/Taps.  Ejector pin  The ejector pin (also called a pilot pin) has three major functions: *Centering - The ejector pin is exactly positioned to the center punch mark. Switch the magnet on and the machine and annular cutter are in the drilling position. *Oiling - Cutting oil for automatic internal lubrication is supplied via the ejector pin. *Ejecting - The spring-loaded ejector pin pushes the core out of the drill hole made by annular cutter.  Cutting speed  The magnetic drilling machines are provided with speed gears and some machines are also equipped with variable speed control. As per the diameter of the annular cutter and the type of annular cutter the speed of the magnetic drilling machine has to be set. The formula for calculating the speed is: n=\\\\frac{v\\\\,x\\\\,1000}{d\\\\,x\\\\,\\\\pi}=min^{-1} d = diameter of the annular cutter in mm. v = cutting speed of the annular cutters.  HSS vs TCT annular cutters Trade-offs between HSS and TCT annular cutters include: *Cost - HSS annular cutters are cheaper than the TCT for smaller diameters up to 40 mm, while TCT are cheaper for diameters above 41 mm. *Re-sharpening - A HSS annular cutter can be resharpened, while re-grinding a TCT is possible but more difficult due to the geometry needed for carbide. Unless carbide is ground properly it can break easily. *Breakage - HSS cutters are made of one piece of steel, while TCT cutters have brazed on teeth, which can break or shatter more easily. *Speed - TCT cutters are faster, especially for larger diameter holes *Hardness - TCT cutters can drill through harder materials due to the carbide tips.

However, Aindrita ruled out this and accused the director as a womanizer and misbehaved with her on the sets. The issue was complained to the Karnataka Film Chamber and other legal associations of Kannada cinema. The incident brought down the reputation of the legendary filmmaker. However, the controversy was resolved in a meeting between the Artists Association President Ambarish and Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce President Jayamala. It was reported that the meeting went on for three hours resulting in the problem being solved with both the director and the actress admitting to their mistakes.  Soundtrack  All the songs are composed by Mano Murthy teaming up with the director yet again. The same team's earlier popular song \\"Nooru Janmaku Nooraru Janmaku\\" from America America! was remixed in this film and was shot at the Macau island.

Located in the chapel of an old almshouse, it houses the art collection of the Ypres Public Centre for Social Welfare (OCMW in Dutch). History During the broadcloth crisis in 1270-1274, many people in Ypres became poor and needed support. A caritative institution was created c. 1273 by Christine de Guinness, the widow of Salomon Belle. By 1276, it was expanded with a chapel and a hospital. Jehan Yperman, the first medical writer in Dutch, worked here from 1304 until his death in 1331. In 1616, a new chapel was built. Until 1796, the Godshuis was led by descendants of Salomon Belle. Then it became a civic institution, used especially for the care of the elderly. It is still in use today and forms the main seat of the Ypres OCMW. The chapel functions as the Museum Godshuis Belle. Like most of Ypres, the site was destroyed during the First World War, and rebuilt afterwards. The architects were Georges Lernould and Jules Coomans, who drew some of the plans but died before the actual building started. They partly reconstructed the old buildings, and partly made new Gothic Revival buildings. The chapel was rebuilt in 1933-1934, with a reconstructed interior. The building became a protected heritage site in 1940. Collection The most important painting in the collection is the painting of the Virgin with the donors Joos Bryde and Yolenthe Belle and their children. It was painted in 1420 by an unknown artist (sometimes called the Master of 1420) and is one of the oldest examples of panel painting in Flanders. The rest of the collection includes more paintings by old masters, a 17th-century altar draping, and a 17th-century linen-press.

Controversies  In 1999 Australian Christian missionary Graham Staines and his two children were burnt to death whilst sleeping in their station wagon in the village of Manoharpur-Keonjhar in Odisha, allegedly by a gang of Bajrang Dal. Pratap Sarangi was the chief of the Bajrang Dal during the year 1999. After the trial, a man named Dara Singh who had links to the Bajrang Dal, and 12 others were convicted of the crime in 2003. Mr. Sarangi denied the fact saying that the investigation was not done in an unbiased and proper way. The high court in Odisha commuted a death sentence for Singh two years later and freed 11 others who were sentenced to life-term prison citing no evidence against the accused, including Pratap Sarangi. Although an official inquiry by the Wadhwa Commission, found no evidence of any one single group's involvement in the attack, 13 people associated with Bajrang Dal were later convicted. Another official inquiry by the National Commission for Minorities found that the killers cheered \\" bajrang dal Zindabad\\" before the attack. He was also arrested on charges of rioting, arson, assault and damaging government property after a 2002 attack on the Orissa state assembly by Hindu right-wing groups, including the Bajrang Dal.

Life Born in London on 27 June 1839, he was youngest son of William Bell, a merchant of Aldersgate Street who was subsequently official assignee in bankruptcy. Educated at private schools, and apprenticed in 1855 to Messrs. Wren & Hopkinson, engineers, of Manchester, he was taken on in 1859 by James Brunlees. For Brunlees, Bell was resident engineer in 1863-5 on the Cleveland Railway, and in 1866-8 on the Mont Cenis Railway, for which he superintended the construction of special locomotives in Paris in 1869-70. While in charge of the Mont Cenis line he rebuilt for the French government the Route Imp√©riale between St. Jean de Maurienne and Lanslebourg after its destruction by flood. Bel was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 4 May 1869, and in 1871 he set up in private practice in London. In 1872-5 he carried out waterworks at Cadiz, for a company which then failed and involved him in monetary losses. With Sir George Barclay Bruce he constructed, during the same period, a railway for the Compagnie du chemin de fer du vieux port de Marseille. In 1880 Bell took service under the Colonial Office, in Jamaica, where his major work was done. Until 1883 he was engaged in reconstructing the government railway in Jamaica between Kingston and Spanish Town, extending the line to Ewarton and Porus, and later to Montego Bay and Port Antonio. The governor Sir Henry Norman appointed him in 1886 a member of the legislative council. In 1887 Bell became director of public works and held the post for 20 years. Under his direction the mileage of good roads was extended from 800 to near 2000; 110 bridges and most of the modern public buildings were built, and works for water-supply, drainage, and lighting were carried out. He unsuccessfully opposed the transfer, in 1889, of the government railways to an American syndicate; the government resumed possession in 1900. Bell was made C.M.G. in 1903. He resigned his appointment in March 1908, returning to England in failing health, and died in London on 29 May 1908. Family Bell married twice: # in 1864 Rebecca (died 1868), daughter of Alexander Bell Filson, M.D.; and # in 1882 Emilie Georgina, daughter of Francis Robertson Lynch, clerk of the legislative council of Jamaica. By his first marriage he had a daughter and a son, Archibald Graeme Bell, who became director of public works in Trinidad, and by his second marriage two daughters and a son.

Its function is to \\"improve the management of the European Union brand\\" The Brand EU Centre was founded in 2014, and is run by Nicolas De Santis, President and Secretary General of Gold Mercury, and Enrique Bar√≥n Crespo, former President of the European Parliament. The Brand EU Centre is based in London, in Gold Mercury House, Mayfair, and is funded privately. As an independent centre it is not funded or affiliated with any EU institutions or governmental bodies, nor is it connected to any political parties. Objectives The Centre's main goal is to improve citizens' understanding and connection to the European Union. The Centre asserts that member states' national governments, and Brussels itself has largely been ineffective at creating a strong EU brand identity among their citizens, and have not done a good job of promoting the EU's work. The Centre's approach argues that connection with the Union has mostly been top down and must also include a bottom-up approach, stating with its citizens and civil society. Centre President, Nicolas De Santis believes that politicians do not help the EU's case, because they scapegoat it for their domestic problems, and claim the Union's successes as their own. The Centre therefore aims to promote awareness among European citizens about the benefits which the European Union brings to their everyday lives. Treating the EU as a brand The Brand EU Centre's mission is to treat the European Union and its identity as a \\"brand\\", which has to be marketed and understood clearly by its consumers (European citizens). The Centre asserts that while, over the past 50 years, Europe has been coming together via closer integration, most of the changes have been made at a political level; and the citizens have not properly connected or identified with the project as a result. The underlying concept is that the collective identity of citizens within the EU, and the values which Europeans adhere and aspire to, constitute a powerful \\"brand identity,\\" which is extremely meaningful and valuable. This refers to values such as peace, democracy, the rule of law, equality, and freedom, among others. The Brand EU Centre argues that while this brand is extremely powerful and valuable, it is not being marketed effectively by official European institutions, causing disenfranchisement and Euroscepticism to become the popular climate. The Brand EU Centre also use publications, campaigns and events to address another \\"failure\\" of the European Union, namely its institutional complexity, which results in citizens' lack of understanding about its operations and democratic legitimacy.

Early life Mihrengiz Kadƒ±n was born on 15 October 1869 in Sochi, North Caucasus. Born as Fatma, she belonged to the Ubykh clan of Circassians. She had a brother named Ibrahim Bey. In 1864, during the ethnic cleansing of Circassians, she had been brought to Istanbul as a young child, where her father entrusted to the imperial harem. Her name according to the custom of the Ottoman court was changed to Mihrengiz. Marriage Mihrengiz married Mehmed as his second wife, when he had been a prince. On 2 March 1886, at the age of sixteen she gave birth to her only son, ≈ûehzade √ñmer Hilmi in the Dolmabah√ße Palace. On 27 April 1909, after Mehmed's accession to the throne, she was given the title of \\"Second Consort\\". In 1912, the \\"Hilal-i Ahmer Centre for Women\\" was organized within the \\"Ottoman Hilal-i Ahmer Association\\", a foundation established in 1877 to provide medical care in Istanbul and surrounding communities. Mihrengiz was a member of this organization. Safiye √ún√ºvar, a teacher at the Palace School, whom she met in 1915, noted in her memoirs that unlike the other wives, Mihrengiz was slim, while the others were quite heavier. This was because she had been suffering from illness from the past few years. On 30 May 1918, Mihrengiz met with the Empress Zita of Bourbon-Parma in the harem of Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace, when the latter visited Istanbul with her husband Emperor Charles I of Austria. Last years and death At the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, Mihrengiz, her son, √ñmer Hilmi and his two children, Mukbile Sultan, and ≈ûehzade Mahmud Namƒ±k, settled firstly in Beirut, Lebanon, then in Nice, France, and finally settling in Alexandria, Egypt, where √ñmer Hilmi died in 1935.

He was a member of the Jordanian and Syrian Branch of the Ba'ath Party. He was jailed in Syria for 23 years after Hafez al-Assad took over power in a coup d'√©tat. Fayez moved to Damascus, Syria and lived there for several years. He was arrested after the coup d'√©tat by Hafez al-Assad in November 1970. At the time of his arrest he was member of the National Command of the Ba'ath Party and considered a supporter of Salah Jadid. He then spent over twenty years in Mezzeh prison, being released in 1993. Fayez then returned to Jordan. After the bombing of Iraq by the United States and the United Kingdom in 1998 Fayez headed the Jordanian National Mobilisation Committee for the Defense of Iraq (NMCDI) after the previous head, Sulayman Arar, died. The NMCDI sought support amongst Arabs to cease the existing embargo against Iraq. It further sponsored peaceful protests, conferences and visiting speakers. Fayez wished to stand candidate in the 2003 elections for the House of Representatives. However, his candidateship was rejected by the Central Elections Committee on the grounds that he did not stand candidate in the right district. As a Bedouin from the Central Badia District he needed to compete there, in line with the quota. Fayez appealed the decision, saying he was a Jordanian citizen with the right to compete in any district he wanted. He also found the quota to be degrading. He had five children, three sons and two daughters. His daughter Hind al-Fayez was elected to the House of Representatives for the Central Badia district Women's Quota in the 2013 elections.

Constructor theory expresses physical laws exclusively in terms of what physical transformations, or tasks, are possible versus which are impossible, and why. By allowing such counterfactual statements into fundamental physics, it allows new physical laws to be expressed, for instance those of the constructor theory of information. Overview The fundamental elements of the theory are tasks, i.e., the abstract specifications of transformations in terms of input/output pairs of attributes. A task is impossible if there is a law of physics that forbids its being performed with arbitrarily high accuracy, and possible otherwise. When it is possible, then a constructor for it can be built, again with arbitrary accuracy and reliability. A constructor is an entity which can cause the task to occur while retaining the ability to cause it again. Examples of constructors include a heat engine (a thermodynamic constructor), a catalyst (a chemical constructor) or a computer program controlling an automated factory (an example of a programmable constructor). The theory was developed by physicists David Deutsch and Chiara Marletto. It draws together ideas from diverse areas including thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, information theory and quantum computation. Quantum mechanics and all other physical theories are claimed to be subsidiary theories, and quantum information becomes a special case of superinformation. Chiara Marletto's constructor theory of life builds on constructor theory. Motivations According to Deutsch, current theories of physics based on quantum mechanics do not adequately explain why some transformations between states of being are possible and some are not. For example, a drop of dye can dissolve in water but thermodynamics shows that the reverse transformation, of the dye clumping back together, is effectively impossible. We do not know at a quantum level why this should be so. Constructor theory provides an explanatory framework built on the transformations themselves, rather than the components. Information has the property that a given statement might have said something else, and one of these alternatives would not be true. The untrue alternative is said to be \\"counterfactual\\". Conventional physical theories do not model such counterfactuals. However the link between information and such physical ideas as the entropy in a thermodynamic system is so strong that they are sometimes identified. For example, the area of a black hole's event horizon is a measure both of the hole's entropy and of the information it contains. Constructor theory is an attempt to bridge this gap, providing a physical model which can express counterfactuals, thus allowing the laws of information and computation to be viewed as laws of physics. Outline In constructor theory, a transformation or change is described as a task. A constructor is a physical entity which is able to carry out a given task repeatedly. A task is only possible if a constructor capable of carrying it out exists, otherwise it is impossible. To work with constructor theory everything is expressed in terms of tasks. The properties of information are then expressed as relationships between possible and impossible tasks. Counterfactuals are thus fundamental statements and the properties of information may be described by physical laws. If a system has a set of attributes, the set of permutations of these attributes is seen as a set of tasks. A computation medium is a system whose attributes permute to always produce a possible task. The set of permutations, and hence of tasks, is a computation set. If it is possible to copy the attributes in the computation set, the computation medium is also an information medium. Information, or a given task, does not rely on a specific constructor. Any suitable constructor will serve. This ability of information to be carried on different physical systems or media is described as interoperability, and arises as the principle that the combination of two information media is also an information medium. Media capable of carrying out quantum computations are called superinformation media, and are characterised by specific properties. Broadly, certain copying tasks on their states are impossible tasks. This is claimed to give rise to all the known differences between quantum and classical information.

History =Foundation (1991‚Äì1992)= Evocation was formed in the autumn of 1991 in Bor√•s by bassist Thomas Josefsson, vocalist Jani Karvola, guitarist Marko Palm√©n, drummer Janne K. Bod√©n and guitarist Vesa Kentt√§kumpu. A few months later, Evocation parted ways with vocalist Jani Karvola. Thomas Josefsson filled the empty spot as vocalist but ceased to continue playing bass. In 1992, two demos were recorded. The first was recorded at Sunlight Studio with producer Tomas Skogsberg. It resulted in a three track and intro demo limited to 500 copies entitled \\"The Ancient Gate\\". Later in an interview, Skogsberg named Evocation as \\"the best demo band he ever had recorded\\". Before the sound recording, Christian \\"Kricke\\" Saarinen filled the role as bassist. The second demo contained four tracks and was recorded in a local studio. Later on, both demos gathered cult status within tape trader communities and are now considered true gems from the early years of the Swedish Death Metal scene. After the recordings, Evocation played shows with other death metal bands such as Ceremonial Oath, Dark Tranquillity, Dismember, and Liars in Wait. =Breakup (1993‚Äì2004)= In the beginning of 1993, Evocation had gained a reputation as a ferocious live band and was considered to be one of the most interesting death metal acts from Sweden. Creating their own unique mix of the Gothenburg and Stockholm death metal sound made waves in the death metal scene. Despite the fact that several labels contacted the band, Evocation was put on indefinite hiatus in the autumn of 1993 due to musical differences. In 2001, the band was contacted by Breath of Night Records, and in November 2004, Evocation reformed and the two demos were released worldwide as a full length, self-titled compilation. =Tales From the Tomb (2005‚Äì2008)= In the summer of 2005, Evocation were due to start rehearsing again. Before the reunion, bass player Kricke parted ways with the band, since he \\"neither had time or energy\\" to start playing again. Martin \\"Tore\\" Toresson was recruited as his replacement in the summer of 2005. After recording a three track demo in 2006, Evocation signed a multi album deal with the German label Cyclone Empire Records in the beginning of 2007. In April 2007, Tales from the Tomb was released. Tales from the Tomb earned massive appraisal all over Europe and was also voted as the 4th \\"Best album of the year\\" in 2007 by all journalists of Metal Hammer Germany. In support of the album, Evocation played numerous summer festivals including Wacken Open Air in Finland and Jalometalli Metal Music Festival in Finland. =Dead Calm Chaos (2008‚Äì2009)= In October 2008, Evocation released their second full-length album, Dead Calm Chaos. It was recorded and mixed in the newly built Evocation Studio. Dead Calm Chaos saw guest appearances of Anders Bj√∂rler, from At The Gates and The Haunted, and Dan Swan√∂ from Bloodbath and Edge of Sanity. The artwork and layout was done by Travis Smith. The album was hailed all over Europe and earned the number 1 position on sound checks in Germany (Legacy Mag) and Sweden (Close-Up). The success also secured Evocation a European tour with Cannibal Corpse, Dying Fetus and Obscura and major summer festival shows such as Summer Breeze Open Air in Germany, Party. San Open Air in Germany, Rock Hard Open Air in Germany & Kaltenbach Open Air in Austria. Evocation also signed with international booking agency Continental Concerts. =Apocalyptic (2010‚Äì2012)= In early 2010, Evocation started to record their third full-length album titled Apocalyptic. For the production of the album the band had been working in Evocation Studio. Drums were produced with Roberto Laghi. Mastering was done at Studio Mega. The cover artwork and layout were done by the Polish artist Xaay. The album was promoted by the band with several touring and festival shows. The European release was scheduled for 29 October through Cyclone Empire Records. Apocalyptic was also licensed in the US & Canada by Metal Blade Records and in Russia by Fono Ltd. =Second compilation, Illusions of Grandeur and EP (2012‚Äì2019)= 2012 saw the release of the band's second compilation, Evoked from Demonic Depths - The Early Years, and the band's fourth studio album, Illusions of Grandeur, released in North America on 23 September 2012, and on 24 September 2012 in Europe.

Mevhibe had a brother, Halil Bey who was in service in the stable of the palace. Halil Bey's daughter G√ºlter Hanƒ±m was married to her step son, ≈ûehzade Mehmed Selaheddin. She was tall, buxom and had beautiful hazel eyes. At a very young age she was given in service to the palace. Marriage Mevhibe married Murad, when he was still a prince on 2 January 1857, when she was twenty-one years old and Murad was sixteen years old. After the succession of Murad to the throne on 30 May 1876, she got the title of \\"Senior Consort\\" everyone thought this most unusual, because Mevhibe had not given birth to any children whatsoever, and in the imperial practice and convention it was not the custom for a childless wife to hold the rank of Kadƒ±n. Murad demonstrated another unusual behavior in this matter a well. He simply insisted that this old love of his, with whom he had grown up since they were both young and who had entered the ranks of his wives when he was still a prince, should become his Ba≈ü Kadƒ±n. After the abduction of her husband from the throne she and Murad's family were imprisoned in the √áƒ±raƒüan Palace, where she lived until death of Murad in 1904. She wore European dresses and used to stay in the palace garden for long time. Character Nonetheless, it was certainly true that Mevhibe possessed the talents and skills necessary to occupy the post of Senior Consort. First of all she was extremely beautiful. Beneath her incomparably graceful black eyebrows, her flashing kohl-tingled black eyes lent an irresistible enchantment to her clear white face warmed with a touch of gentle pink whenever she spoke. She was highly intelligent and perceptive. Anyone who met her or spoke with her could not help but fall under her bewitching spell. And she had long reconciled herself to her lot; throughout their imprisonment in the √áƒ±raƒüan Palace, she remained completely loyal to her husband.

At the exile of imperial family in 1924, she stayed in Istanbul. She died on 21 February 1936 at the age of 100 and she was the longest living Ottoman consorts.

The five- volume work was written between 50 and 70 CE by Pedanius Dioscorides, a Greek physician in the Roman army. It was widely read for more than 1,500 years until supplanted by revised herbals in the Renaissance, making it one of the longest-lasting of all natural history books. The work describes many drugs known to be effective, including aconite, aloes, colocynth, colchicum, henbane, opium and squill. In all, about 600 plants are covered, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from them. De materia medica was circulated as illustrated manuscripts, copied by hand, in Greek, Latin and Arabic throughout the mediaeval period. From the sixteenth century on, Dioscorides' text was translated into Italian, German, Spanish, and French, and in 1655 into English. It formed the basis for herbals in these languages by men such as Leonhart Fuchs, Valerius Cordus, Lobelius, Rembert Dodoens, Carolus Clusius, John Gerard and William Turner. Gradually these herbals included more and more direct observations, supplementing and eventually supplanting the classical text. Several manuscripts and early printed versions of De materia medica survive, including the illustrated Vienna Dioscurides manuscript written in the original Greek in sixth-century Constantinople; it was used there by the Byzantines as a hospital text for just over a thousand years. Sir Arthur Hill saw a monk on Mount Athos still using a copy of Dioscorides to identify plants in 1934. Book Dioscorides receives a mandrake root. Vienna Dioscurides manuscript, early sixth century Blackberry. Vienna Dioscurides, early sixth century Mandrake (written 'ŒúŒëŒùŒîŒ°ŒëŒìŒüŒ°Œë' in Greek capitals). Naples Dioscurides, seventh century Physician preparing an elixir, from an Arabic Dioscorides, 1224 book of simples (c. 1334) after Dioscorides Between 50 and 70 AD, a Greek physician in the Roman army, Dioscorides, wrote a five-volume book in his native Greek, (Peri hules iatrikƒìs, \\"On Medical Material\\"), known more widely in Western Europe by its Latin title De materia medica. He had studied pharmacology at Tarsus in Roman Anatolia (now Turkey). The book became the principal reference work on pharmacology across Europe and the Middle East for over 1500 years, and was thus the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias. In contrast to many classical authors, De materia medica was not \\"rediscovered\\" in the Renaissance, because it never left circulation; indeed, Dioscorides' text eclipsed the Hippocratic Corpus. In the medieval period, De materia medica was circulated in Latin, Greek, and Arabic.Some detail about medieval manuscripts of De materia medica at Ibidis Press In the Renaissance from 1478 onwards, it was printed in Italian, German, Spanish, and French as well. In 1655, John Goodyer made an English translation from a printed version, probably not corrected from the Greek. While being reproduced in manuscript form through the centuries, the text was often supplemented with commentary and minor additions from Arabic and Indian sources. Several illustrated manuscripts of De materia medica survive. The most famous is the lavishly illustrated Vienna Dioscurides (the Juliana Anicia Codex), written in the original Greek in Byzantine Constantinople in 512/513 AD; its illustrations are sufficiently accurate to permit identification, something not possible with later medieval drawings of plants; some of them may be copied from a lost volume owned by Juliana Anicia's great grandfather, Theodosius II, in the early 5th century. The Naples Dioscurides and Morgan Dioscurides are somewhat later Byzantine manuscripts in Greek, while other Greek manuscripts survive today in the monasteries of Mount Athos. Densely illustrated Arabic copies survive from the 12th and 13th centuries. The result is a complex set of relationships between manuscripts, involving translation, copying errors, additions of text and illustrations, deletions, reworkings, and a combination of copying from one manuscript and correction from another. De materia medica is the prime historical source of information about the medicines used by the Greeks, Romans, and other cultures of antiquity. The work also records the Dacian names for some plants, which otherwise would have been lost. The work presents about 600 medicinal plants in all, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from these sources. Botanists have not always found Dioscorides' plants easy to identify from his short descriptions, partly because he had naturally described plants and animals from southeastern Europe, whereas by the sixteenth century his book was in use all over Europe and across the Islamic world. This meant that people attempted to force a match between the plants they knew and those described by Dioscorides, leading to what could be catastrophic results. Approach Each entry gives a substantial amount of detail on the plant or substance in question, concentrating on medicinal uses but giving such mention of other uses (such as culinary) and help with recognition as considered necessary. For example, on the \\"Mekon Agrios and Mekon Emeros\\", the opium poppy and related species, Dioscorides states that the seed of one is made into bread: it has \\"a somewhat long little head and white seed\\", while another \\"has a head bending down\\" and a third is \\"more wild, more medicinal and longer than these, with a head somewhat long ‚Äî and they are all cooling.\\" After this brief description, he moves at once into pharmacology, saying that they cause sleep; other uses are to treat inflammation and erysipela, and if boiled with honey to make a cough mixture. The account thus combines recognition, pharmacological effect, and guidance on drug preparation. Its effects are summarized, accompanied by a caution: Dioscorides then describes how to tell a good from a counterfeit preparation. He mentions the recommendations of other physicians, Diagoras (according to Eristratus), Andreas, and Mnesidemus, only to dismiss them as false and not borne out by experience. He ends with a description of how the liquid is gathered from poppy plants, and lists names used for it: chamaesyce, mecon rhoeas, oxytonon; papaver to the Romans, and wanti to the Egyptians. As late as in the Tudor and Stuart periods in Britain, herbals often still classified plants in the same way as Dioscorides and other classical authors, not by their structure or apparent relatedness but by how they smelt and tasted, whether they were edible, and what medicinal uses they had. Only when European botanists like Matthias de l'Obel, Andrea Cesalpino and Augustus Quirinus Rivinus (Bachmann) had done their best to match plants they knew to those listed in Dioscorides did they go further and create new classification systems based on similarity of parts, whether leaves, fruits, or flowers. Contents The book is divided into five volumes. Dioscorides organized the substances by certain similarities, such as their being aromatic, or vines; these divisions do not correspond to any modern classification. In David Sutton's view the grouping is by the type of effect on the human body. =Volume I: Aromatics= Volume I covers aromatic oils, the plants that provide them, and ointments made from them. They include what are probably cardamom, nard, valerian, cassia or senna, cinnamon, balm of Gilead, hops, mastic, turpentine, pine resin, bitumen, heather, quince, apple, peach, apricot, lemon, pear, medlar, plum and many others. =Volume II: Animals to herbs= Volume II covers an assortment of topics: animals including sea creatures such as sea urchin, seahorse, whelk, mussel, crab, scorpion, electric ray, viper, cuttlefish and many others; dairy produce; cereals; vegetables such as sea kale, beetroot, asparagus; and sharp herbs such as garlic, leek, onion, caper and mustard. =Volume III: Roots, seeds and herbs= Volume III covers roots, seeds and herbs. These include plants that may be rhubarb, gentian, liquorice, caraway, cumin, parsley, lovage, fennel and many others. =Volume IV: Roots and herbs, continued= Volume IV describes further roots and herbs not covered in Volume III. These include herbs that may be betony, Solomon's seal, clematis, horsetail, daffodil and many others. =Volume V: Vines, wines and minerals= Volume V covers the grapevine, wine made from it, grapes and raisins; but also strong medicinal potions made by boiling many other plants including mandrake, hellebore, and various metal compounds, such as what may be zinc oxide, verdigris and iron oxide. Influence and effectiveness De materia medica in Arabic, Spain, 12th-13th century =On Arabic medicine= Wild Cucumber in Arabic Dioscorides. 13th century, Persia Along with his fellow physicians of Ancient Rome, Aulus Cornelius Celsus, Galen, Hippocrates and Soranus of Ephesus, Dioscorides had a major and long-lasting effect on Arabic medicine as well as medical practice across Europe. De materia medica was one of the first scientific works to be translated from Greek into Arabic. It was translated first into Syriac and then into Arabic in 9th century Baghdad. =In Europe= Writing in The Great Naturalists, the historian of science David Sutton describes De materia medica as \\"one of the most enduring works of natural history ever written\\" and that \\"it formed the basis for Western knowledge of medicines for the next 1,500 years.\\" The historian of science Marie Boas writes that herbalists depended entirely on Dioscorides and Theophrastus until the sixteenth century, when they finally realized they could work on their own. She notes also that herbals by different authors, such as Leonhart Fuchs, Valerius Cordus, Lobelius, Rembert Dodoens, Carolus Clusius, John Gerard and William Turner, were dominated by Dioscorides, his influence only gradually weakening as the sixteenth century herbalists \\"learned to add and substitute their own observations\\". The historian of early science and medicine Paula Findlen, writing in the Cambridge History of Science, calls De materia medica \\"one of the most successful and enduring herbals of antiquity, [which] emphasized the importance of understanding the natural world in light of its medicinal efficiency\\", in contrast to Pliny's Natural History (which emphasized the wonders of nature) or the natural history studies of Aristotle and Theophrastus (which emphasized the causes of natural phenomena). The historian of medicine Vivian Nutton, in Ancient Medicine, writes that Dioscorides's \\"five books in Greek On Materia medica attained canonical status in Late Antiquity.\\" The historian of science Brian Ogilvie calls Dioscorides \\"the greatest ancient herbalist\\", and De materia medica \\"the summa of ancient descriptive botany\\", observing that its success was such that few other books in his domain have survived from classical times. Further, his approach matched the Renaissance liking for detailed description, unlike the philosophical search for essential nature (as in Theophrastus's Historia Plantarum). A critical moment was the decision by Niccol√≤ Leoniceno and others to use Dioscorides \\"as the model of the careful naturalist‚Äîand his book De materia medica as the model for natural history.\\" Byzantine De materia medica, 15th century The Dioscorides translator and editor Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that \\"For almost two millennia Dioscorides was regarded as the ultimate authority on plants and medicine\\", and that he \\"achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully.\\" To illustrate this, she states that \\"Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including aconite, aloes, bitter apple, colchicum, henbane, and squill\\". The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to aspirin, she writes), autumn crocus and opium, which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as \\"minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and emollients ... [such as] ammoniacum, anise, cardamoms, catechu, cinnamon, colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum, gentian, hemlock, hyoscyamus, lavender, linseed, mastic, male fern, marjoram, marshmallow, mezereon, mustard, myrrh, orris (iris), oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal, pepper, peppermint, poppy, psyllium, rhubarb, rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber (elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax, stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore, white horehound, and couch grass ‚Äî the last still used as a demulcent diuretic.\\" She notes that medicines such as wormwood, juniper, ginger, and calamine also remain in use, while \\"Chinese and Indian physicians continue to use liquorice\\". She observes that the many drugs listed to reduce the spleen may be explained by the frequency of malaria in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause abortion and to treat urinary tract infection; palliatives for toothache, such as colocynth, and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases. As well as these useful substances, she observes that \\"A few superstitious practices are recorded in De materia medica,\\" such as using Echium as an amulet to ward off snakes, or Polemonia (Jacob's ladder) for scorpion stings. In the view of the historian Paula De Vos, De materia medica formed the core of the European pharmacopoeia until the end of the 19th century, suggesting that \\"the timelessness of Dioscorides' work resulted from an empirical tradition based on trial and error; that it worked for generation after generation despite social and cultural changes and changes in medical theory\\". At Mount Athos in northern Greece Dioscorides's text was still in use in its original Greek into the 20th century, as observed in 1934 by Sir Arthur Hill, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew: References  Bibliography  * * (subscription required for online access)   * * = Editions = Note: Editions may vary by both text and numbering of chapters ;Greek: * Naples Dioscurides: Codex ex Vindobonensis Graecus 1 ca 500 AD, at Biblioteca Nazionale di Napoli site  English description, World Digital Library * Edition of Karl Gottlob K√ºhn, being Volume XXV of his Medicorum Graecorum Opera, Leipzig 1829, together with annotation and parallel text in Latin  Book I - Book II - Book III - Book IV - Book V - Indices * Edition of Max Wellman, Berlin  Books I, II - Books III, IV - Book V ;Greek and Latin * (Index in frontispiece) ;Latin: * Edition of Jean Ruel 1552  Index - Preface - Book I - Book II - Book III - Book IV - Book V * De Medica Materia : libri sex, Ioanne Ruellio Suesseionensi interprete, translated by Jean Ruel (1546). * De Materia medica : libri V Eiusdem de Venenis Libri duo.

They are named after the former owner of the manuscript, the French Jesuit Denis P√©tau (1583‚Äì1652), whose name, in Latin, is Dionysius Petavius. The standard critical edition of the Annales is that of Georg Pertz in the Monumenta Germaniae Historica. The first entry in the Annales Petaviani is for the year 687 and records the Battle of Tertry. There is then a gap until 708, when the annals begin again and continue to 799 in chronological order. Those entries through to 771 were compiled from earlier annals, such as the Annales sancti Amandi and the Annales mosellani, and do not comprise an independent source. Together with the Annales sancti Amandi, the Annales Petaviani are the primary source of the entries for 741‚Äì88 in the Annales laurissenses maiores. Both of these may have been based on an earlier exemplar originally compiled contemporaneously with events at the convent of Sankt Martin in Cologne. For the years 771‚Äì99 the Annales Petaviani are an independent and contemporary source. They are the only source to date Charlemagne's birth to 747. They are also the only source to name either of Carloman I's two known sons, who fled to Italy with his widow in 771. The one born towards 770, whom Pope Stephen III offered to baptise himself, was named Pepin. Carloman's widow, Gisela, is also named in only one source: the Annales mettenses priores. The Annales Petaviani also provide a unique explanation for the retirement of Carloman's uncle and namesake, Carloman, son of Charles Martel, who entered the Abbey of Montecassino in 747, leaving power in the hands of his brother, Pepin the Short. The Annales claim that Carloman's conversion to the religious life came about because his conscience was unsettled by his defeat in Alemannia, where he lost thousands of men: Karolomannus intravit Alamanniam ubi fertur quod multa hominum millia ceciderit. Unde compunctus regnum reliquit (\\"Carloman entered Alemannia where it is said that many thousands of men died. In remorse he relinquished the kingdom\\"). The Annales also provide evidence of an Anglo-Saxon presence in Marseille, the great seaport of Merovingian Gaul, when they note under the year 790 the death of the son of Botto, an English negotiator in Marseille.

Background The last election in 2010 saw Labour winning a majority with 36 seats, compared to 27 for the Conservatives. No other parties held seats. Election result Labour retained control, winning 41 seats, five of them gained from the Conservatives who dropped to 22 seats.

For the second consecutive election, there was no representation from other parties on the council. The Greens fielded candidates in every ward for the second successive election and finished third in the election in terms of votes cast.

The ‚ÄúRivi√®re Blanche‚Äù (La Tuque) is the main tributary of the Manouane River (La Tuque), and is part of the watershed of Saint-Maurice River.  Geography  The White River drains dozens of lakes generally along the rail Senneterre - La Tuque, or in the area to the north of this section. This river flows entirely in forest areas. Starting from Wemotaci, Forest Road Parent - Wemotaci generally along the route of the White River, first by the south side of the river to near Casey, then the north side. Several headwater lakes of the river are located between 16 and 28 km north of Casey, the main one being the Weectigo lake. The river then descends southward recovering the lake Guenette. Then the river veers to the east, picking up the lakes and Letondal Capimit before moving north of Casey. Note that the Letondal lake receives the waters northwest of the Ruban River. Then the White River branches off to the north, where it receives the discharge lakes B√©rard and Ellwood. From there, the river forms an open south semicircle to its mouth. Near the outlet of Lake Island (located south of Grand Lake Castor), the White River branches south to 22.5 km (direct line) from its mouth or 36.5 km (by water). In this sector, the course of the river flows south for 26 km (measured by water), then meets a winding segment 2.5 km (measured by water) which ends at 16 km from its mouth. After the winding segment, the river flows southeast to its mouth, which is located 1.6 km upstream of the mouth of Manouane River (La Tuque).

In it each of the researchers, collectively known as \\"The QI Elves\\", present their favourite fact that they have come across that week. The most regular presenters of the podcast are James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Ptaszynski and Dan Schreiber, and there are occasional guest presenters. When one of the regular presenters is unavailable for any reason, fellow QI elves Alex Bell and Anne Miller often take their place. Since the launch of the podcast it has attracted 700,000 subscribers. In 2014 No Such Thing as a Fish was named by Apple as the \\"Best New Podcast\\" that year. In 2015 and 2016 it won the \\"Internet Award\\" in the Chortle Awards. In 2018 the podcast won the Heinz Oberhummer Award for Science Communication. In May 2016, a television spin-off series entitled No Such Thing as the News began on BBC Two. Title The title for No Such Thing as a Fish comes from a fact in the QI TV series. In the third episode of the eighth series, also known as \\"Series H\\", an episode on the theme of \\"Hoaxes\\" reported that after a lifetime studying fish the biologist Stephen Jay Gould concluded that there was no such thing as a fish. He reasoned that although there are many sea creatures, most of them are not closely related to each other. For example, a salmon is more closely related to a camel than it is to a hagfish. The opening of early episodes of the podcast used to feature a recording of the elves mentioning this fact, which appears in the first paragraph of the Oxford Encyclopedia of Underwater Life. Format The regular QI elves who present No Such Thing as a Fish (left-to- right); Andrew Hunter Murray, Dan Schreiber, Anna Ptaszynski and James Harkin. In each episode each presenter takes it in turn to present their favourite fact that they have come across that week. They discuss the information surrounding that fact, and the other presenters add in extra facts and information connecting to it. Production In an interview with ThreeWeeks, Schreiber said the podcast \\"came about because too many facts in the QI office kept going to waste. Like the time Chief Elf James Harkin looked up from his computer and said: 'You know there are currently over 600 guys in the world with two dicks'. We decided to gather round a microphone once a week and share our favourite facts we'd found that week.\\" Murray told The Independent: \\"We almost released it by mistake. We uploaded it and only mentioned it on our own personal social media accounts. We thought it was good, but the reaction has been lovely. It seems like there's a real appetite for more podcasts like this. There is a feeling of resurgence of the whole medium.\\" Episodes are normally recorded at the QI offices in Covent Garden, although there have been live recordings in other locations. The theme tune used is the song \\"Wasps\\" by Emperor Yes, whose lead singer Ash Gardner has also appeared as a guest on the podcast. Reception Miranda Sawyer in The Observer gave the podcast a positive review writing, \\"the podcast is jolly, packed with impressive and silly facts, and so far hasn't descended into too much in-joke chumminess, so hooray for No Such Thing As a Fish\\". Comedy critic Bruce Dessau wrote on his Beyond the Joke blog that: \\"All it lacks is the likes of Alan Davies [a panelist on the TV version of QI] and co chipping in with their comedic quips, but there are still plenty of laughs to be had.\\" In December 2014 the podcast was named by Apple as the \\"Best New Podcast\\" for 2014. In March 2015 it won the \\"Internet Award\\" in the 2015 Chortle Awards. It won the same award again in March 2016. In April 2019 it was announced that the podcast won the \\"Heinz Oberhummer Award f√ºr Wissenschaftskommunikation\\" (Heinz Oberhummer Award in science communication), an Austrian award for excellence in science communication. The award is named after Heinz Oberhummer, an Austrian physicist, founder and former part of an Austrian science cabaret, the Science Busters.

Description Clackline Refractory is located on Refractory Road, Clackline, Western Australia in a valley near Great Eastern Highway. , the site is in poor condition and mostly deserted, apart from stacks of various ceramic products. As well as kilns suitable for modern day production, the site has older kilns constructed from bricks, with corrugated iron roofs supported by metal poles. Alongside these structures is a large brick chimney. History Clackline Firebrick Company display at the 1905 Perth A.N.A. Exhibition Fine quality clay was discovered in the Clackline area in 1898 by John Ford and James Murray, while prospecting for gold. Out of several shafts sunk, no gold was discovered, but one appeared to show an abundant quantity of fire-clay. Ford and Murray formed the Clackline Firebrick Company in 1900 to test the deposit, and henceforth began operating an extensive quarry. The quarry had a practically limitless supply of clay. The quality of bricks produced by the refractory was at least comparable to those imported from England and Scotland, and at least one test showed that the imported bricks would fail before the local ones. In 1901, the industry was important to Western Australia, with the brick products from Clackline used by multiple government departments, the Fremantle Gas Company, and many goldmines. Other users of the bricks included the Railway Department, the Perth Gas Company, the Fremantle smelter, and the Great Boulder Perseverance Company. Testimonials from users was positive. The initial firebrick company operated for only two years, before it was taken over by the Bunnings until 1903, and the Hunter Family from then until the 1950s. In 1905, the Clackline Firebrick Company exhibited its products at the Perth Australian Natives' Association (A.N.A.) exhibition. These included firebox arches, as used on the railways; fire bricks similar to those used at the Perth gasworks; and foundry fire lunks, as used at the Midland Junction Railway Workshops. By 1908, thousands of tonnes of clay had been mined \\"without making any appreciable impression upon the enormous deposit\\". The works had the latest machinery of that time, with drying sheds for the weeks-long process of drying large fire-lumps that occurs after they are removed from the furnace. Products the company started to make included paving bricks, garden tiles, and surface drain blocks. The paving bricks were used by the Perth City Council along Wellington Street. In the late 1960s, Clackline Refractory underwent an expansion, and reportedly had difficulty recruiting workers due to a shortage of accommodation in the area.

Considering one of the world's top Greco-Roman wrestlers in his decade, Tsitsiashvili had claimed numerous medals in the international scene, including his prestigious gold from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships, and later represented as part of the Israeli team in three editions of the Olympic Games (1996, 2000, and 2004). Tsitsiashvili also became a member of the Hapoel Be'er Sheva Club under his personal coach Yakov Masin. Tsitsiashvili started his wrestling career as a member of the former Soviet team. When he emigrated to Israel in 1994, Tsitsiashvili sought his sights to compete in the international arena and eventually take home the silver medal at the European Wrestling Championships in Athens, Greece. The following year, Tsitsiashvili continued to flourish his sporting career by finishing third in the same tournament, and eventually picked up a silver in the 82-kg division at the 1995 World Wrestling Championships in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, making him the first Israeli in history to claim a sporting medal. As Israel's only wrestler to the team, Tsitsiashvili made his official debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where he competed in the men's middleweight class (82 kg). Being successful early in the opening rounds, he entered the semifinals powerful and undefeated, but fell to Germany's Thomas Zander, and then shortened his chance to compete for the bronze when he was outclassed by Kazakhstan's Daulet Turlykhanov in his next match. With Sweden's Martin Lidberg being frail and injured, Tsitsiashvili managed to finish in fifth at the end of the tournament. Determined to return to the Olympic scene and medal, Tsitsiashvili entered the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney as a top medal contender in the men's light heavyweight division (85 kg). He lost his opening match to Norway's Fritz Aanes, but managed to score a set of two triumphs to surmount Uzbekistan's Yuriy Vitt and Tunisia's Amor Bach Hamba in the prelim pool. Finishing second in the elimination round and sixth overall, Tsitsiashvili's performance was not enough to advance him further into the semifinals as he left the Games in anguish. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Tsitsiashvili qualified for his third team, as a 31-year-old veteran, in the men's 84 kg class with a brilliant historic success. Earlier in the process, he defeated Sweden's Ara Abrahamian to take home the light heavyweight trophy and a gold medal at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in Cr√©teil, France, which earned him a spot on the Israeli Olympic team. In the prelim pool, Tsitsiashvili eclipsed France's M√©lonin Noumonvi with a powerful score of 3‚Äì1, but could not pin Russian wrestler and European champion Alexei Mishin into the ring, as he was outmatched by his fresh opponent without collecting a single point. Tsitsiashvili failed to advance further into the quarterfinals after finishing the pool in second place and fourteenth overall. Realizing about his age and future game plan, Tsitsiashvili announced his retirement from the sport shortly after the Games.

It was released in 2011 by True North Records.  Background  Cockburn said two of the songs on the album had been inspired by his travels and work. \\"Through the auspices of various organizations, I‚Äôve been to troubled areas around the world,\\" he told the PremierGuitar.com website. \\"I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm doing the real work, but through my songs I can bring attention to these issues, hopefully helping to make the world a better place‚Äîor at least keep it from getting worse so fast. My travels don‚Äôt show up too much on this album, except on the song \\"Each One Lost\\" and the instrumental \\"Ancestors,\\" which I wrote following a trip to Kandahar, Afghanistan under the auspices of the Canadian army. I witnessed a ceremony there honoring the sacrifices of two soldiers who had been killed and whose bodies were being flown back to Canada. I felt I had to give listeners an impression of what that felt like, so I went home and wrote \\"Each One Lost,\\" the first half of which is in my perspective and the second half in that of a soldier. It was a very deep and emotional experience‚Äîone of the saddest things I‚Äôve ever had the privilege to witness, and I wanted to let listeners know how it felt.\\" Another song, \\"Gifts,\\" originally written in 1968 but never previously recorded. Cockburn explained: \\"When we did the first album, back at the end of the ‚Äò60s I was singing that song in my shows. At the time, (manager) Bernie Finkelstein kept trying to get me to record the song, and I told him I was going to save it for the last album. After a while it just kind of disappeared. When we started to record this album I thought it‚Äôd be cool to bring back 'Gifts' but not tell Bernie. I also felt that at this point you never know ... I‚Äôm not getting any younger. So maybe there will be another album or maybe there won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not a prediction of any kind. I just thought it was time to get it on record.\\" He said Finkelstein was taken aback when he first heard the recording. \\"When the song started, he just took a double take right away,\\" Cockburn said. \\"He turned to me after it was over, and he said, 'Is there anything I should know?' And I said no‚Äîit was just in case.\\" The album features two songs co-written with former Wailin' Jennys member Annabelle Chvostek. Cockburn said: \\"I haven‚Äôt done very much co-writing with people over the years. Annabelle called me up one day and asked if I‚Äôd like to try writing a song with her. I hadn‚Äôt written anything for a while and I thought, 'That might be good.' ... I knew she was good. And I thought maybe this was the catalyst to get my own creative juices flowing again. We wrote 'Driving Away' and then got together again and wrote 'Boundless'. We wrote them as duets because we were writing them as equals, so we decided that we would record them on that level and perform them on that level.\\" On another song, \\"Call Me Rose,\\" he writes from the point of view of Richard Nixon, reincarnated as a single mother living in the projects. \\"I woke up one morning with this song in my head,\\" Cockburn said, \\"and the opening line of the song is, 'My name was Richard Nixon, only now I'm a girl'.\\" He said he had been angered by an earlier campaign by a member of the Bush administration to bring back the image of Richard Nixon. \\"There were all these pronouncements being made by various pundits in the press that he was the 'greatest President ever' and that he was misunderstood and all this baloney. And the interesting thing was nobody bought it. They kept doing this for a couple months and then all of a sudden it just disappeared; which suggested to me that somebody had paid to get this campaign going and once it hadn‚Äôt born fruit just cut it off. I was pleased to see that the American public was not taken in. Other than the fact that he made a very important gesture in terms of establishing communications with China‚Äîthere‚Äôs no taking that away from him‚Äîhe was a crook and a scumbag and no one should think otherwise. The fact that he was also an intelligent man doesn‚Äôt really mitigate the crookedness, or the carrying on of the war. The idea that you could bring him back as the 'greatest president ever' was absurd. So I suppose somewhere in there I might have been thinking, 'What would it take rehabilitate actual Richard Nixon?' Not just his image. So in the song he‚Äôs re-imagined as a single mom living in the projects. I guess it‚Äôs kind of like Groundhog Day.\\" \\"Comets of Kandahar\\", one of four instrumentals on the album, also had its origins in Afghanistan: \\"An instrumental piece isn‚Äôt really about anything, but you have to come up with names for these things. So the title came from something one of the Canadian soldiers said to me while we were standing there watching‚Äîwhat I learned was kind of a nightly pleasure for a lot of people on the base‚Äîthe jet fighters taking off constantly, twenty-four hours a day, for missions or patrols. They go off in pairs, thirty seconds apart, and after dark you can‚Äôt see them; you just hear a roar. But a moment later you‚Äôll see the flame, from the tail cone, coming out of the fighter. And that‚Äôs all you can see. There‚Äôs this glowing purplish cone flying across the sky. Everyone stops to look at this because it‚Äôs a beautiful sight. So there we are standing, a bunch of us, and we‚Äôre all looking at it, and the soldier standing next to me said, 'The comets of Kandahar.' So that became the title of the piece.\\" Reception In a review for Allmusic, critic Thom Jurek wrote \\"Cockburn's words have always held keen insight when pointed at the world, but these cut away the outside and look in the mirror first. There are some fine instrumentals here, too... Small Source of Comfort, which‚Äîfor all its economy‚Äîis abundant in wisdom, empathy, and acceptance; further, it is illuminated beautifully in a deeply personal, even iconic, musical language.\\" Joseph Jon Lanthier of Slant Magazine wrote \\"With the meditative bemusement and ever-changing geographic backdrops of a pilgrim, Bruce Cockburn is arguably at his best when recollecting intense observations in tranquility... his humane snapshots are no less vivid now, but he seems unprecedentedly distant from their emotional heft.\\" PremiereGuitar.com praised the album: \\"Cockburn's shimmering arpeggios, syncopated riffs, and hypnotic single-note lines blend elements of Mississippi John Hurt, Jerry Garcia, Leo Kottke, and Brazilian greats Luiz Bonfa and Oscar Castro-Neves, yet remain entirely his own.\\" Cockburn and Small Source of Comfort received two Canadian Folk Music Awards, for best contemporary album, and best solo artist.\\"Bruce Cockburn.\\" In Contemporary Musicians.

Built by the Society of Jesus in the year 1630 with the permission of the reigning Archbishop of Manila, its establishment marked the beginning of the recorded history of Marikina, which was once a vast and mountainous area traversed by the Marikina River. History An old photograph of the Chapel, from the archives of the Marikina City Library. The construction of Jes√∫s de la Pe√±a Chapel marks the beginning of Christianity in Marikina. Before the Spaniards arrived, the area was settled by river-dwellers who relied on the Marikina River for their means of livelihood. When the Jesuits first came to the idyllic, fertile land now known as Jes√∫s dela Pe√±a, they brought with them a small image of Jesus. Fired with zeal to convert the natives to Catholicism, they held the first Mass in a former storage house on April 16, 1630. Afterwards, they immediately formed their order at the west bank of the river which was full of big rocks. Inspired by the site, the priests soon called the place as \\"Jes√∫s de la Pe√±a\\" (Jesus of the Rock) which was also the name of the new mission. Later, the Augustinians' control over Marikina spread from Santa Elena to Jes√∫s de la Pe√±a. When the Jesuits ceded the chapel to Augustinians, Governor Gabriel Cruz Elasque instructed the transfer of the order to Sta. Elena because the visita was prone to frequent flooding from the Marikina River. On March 7, 1988, the Chapel underwent renovations which lasted until June 19, 1988. Architecture The chapel is designed in Neo-Romanesque style as indicated by the arched openings and light facade. In the chapel's early designs, a row of monolithic columns is used for support and decoration as it was a common feature for Roman and early Christian architecture. A quaint bell tower is attached at the left side of the church which signifies its pragmatic, simple design of having been built beside the river which has a high tendency to overflow during the wet season. The marker placed by the National Historical Commission commemorating the chapel's historical significance Historical Marker The Philippine National Historical Commission acknowledges the Chapel's historical relevance with a marker with the following inscription (translated from the original Filipino): On the former site of a storehouse where now this Chapel stands, is where the first Mass was held on April 16, 1630, under the auspices of Father Pedro de Arce, Bishop of Manila. The Mass was conducted by Jesuit missionaries who discovered on the plateau an image of Christ, which was venerated by the whole town of Jesus dela Pe√±a, which is now a village of Marikina.

TMS is established as a UK registered charity, number 284013, with the objective \\"to advance the education of the public in the study of Micropalaeontology\\" and is operated exclusively for scientific and educational purposes. It publishes a journal, special publications and newsletter, organises meetings and makes various awards and grants. The society is organised into six specialist groups, namely Foraminifera, Microvertebrates, Calcareous Nannofossils, Ostracods, Palynology and Silicofossils. The groups hold separate meetings, including field trips, throughout the year; these were traditionally meetings for UK-based members but have become more international in their scope. For example, the TMS joint Foraminifera and Nannofossil Spring Meeting have taken place in Denmark, France, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, and The Netherlands.TMS Joint Foraminifera-Nannofossil Meeting 2014 http://www.tmsoc.org/foram-nanno2014.html The Society holds an annual conference during November each year.  History  The Micropalaeontological Society was founded in 1970 as the British Micropalaeontological Group (BMG) with the stated aim of furthering the study of micropalaeontology. The primary founder of the BMG was Professor Leslie Rowsell Moore (1912‚Äì2003) of the University of Sheffield. The principal aims of the BMG were to host scientific meetings and to organise multidisciplinary micropalaeontological research on British type sections from all systems, and publish the results. The inaugural committee and technical meetings of the BMG were held in Imperial College London in 1971.Hodgkinson R. L. (2008) \\"Tales from the Archive 1- The Foundation of The Society, 1970-1971\\".

The latter were the conodont, foraminifera, ostracods, pollen, spores, and non-calcareous microplankton (i.e. palynology), and other special micropalaeontological interests. In 1975, the BMG became the British Micropalaeontological Society (BMS) and it produced its first publication, a newsletter The British Micropalaeontologist.Hodgkinson R. L. (2008) \\"Tales from the Archive 2. New Beginnings ‚Äì 1976/1977 ‚Äì The Newsletter\\". Newsletter of Micropalaeontology 78, p.39-40 http://www.tmsoc.org/pdf/tms77.pdf. In 2001 the Society changed its name to The Micropalaeontological Society (TMS), to reflect the increasing international profile and membership. There are currently (2014) six specialist groups, namely Calcareous Nannofossil, Foraminifera, Microvertebrate, Ostracod, Palynology and Silicofossil. Members of TMS may elect to be part of one or more of these groups. Specialist group and general meetings are held throughout the year and the Annual General Meeting is traditionally held each November. The society is one of the three main UK-based palaeontological societies and collaborates with the Palaeontological Association the Palaeontographical Society and the Geological Society of London via the Joint Committee for Palaeontology.  Publications  The society produces the Newsletter of Micropalaeontology twice a year. In 1982 the association initiated its serial journal, the Journal of Micropalaeontology.The Geological Society of London Journal of Micropalaeontology (https://journal-of-micropalaeontology.net/index.html Between 1982 and 1983, one issue per year was produced; this was increased to two parts per annum in 1984. The journal i now fully open access, and is currently published by Copernicus Publication. Prior to this the society published occasional publications such as stratigraphical atlases of individual microfossil groups and conference proceedings and the Stereo Atlas of Ostracod Shells (published 1973-1998). In 2003 the society changed the publication model from essentially self-publishing to using the Geological Society Publishing House (GSPH) for all matters associated with production and distribution. The GSPH now produces all the society Special Publications. To date, there have been 6 Micropalaeontology Special Publications produced with the GSPH: * TMS006 - Landmarks in Foraminiferal Micropalaeontology: History and Development. Edited by A.J.

The Florida grasshopper sparrow is one of four subspecies of grasshopper sparrows in North America, and is perhaps the most endangered. Despite biologists' best efforts, attempts at improving the declining population have been largely unsuccessful.  Description  The Florida grasshopper sparrow is a small sparrow with a short tail and rounded head, averaging 13 cm in total length when fully grown. Like most grasshopper sparrows, their wings are brown, white, and grey in color, with patches of yellow on their alula and supercilium. Adult sparrows have white undersides with a buff throat and breast, while juveniles have streaked breasts. The Florida grasshopper sparrow has a longer bill and tarsi than other subspecies, and lacks reddish streaks on its nape. The song of the Florida grasshopper sparrow sounds much like that of a grasshopper, which is where it gets its name. Males only sing a few hours a day during the breeding season, and they often perch on twigs or dead palmetto leaves to sing when available. Singing most frequently occurs during the early morning and early evening hours, around sunrise and sunset.  Habitat  Though some migratory grasshopper sparrows are distributed throughout parts of both North and South America, the Florida grasshopper sparrow is a non-migratory species, and is thus limited in distribution to the prairie region of south-central Florida. Counties in Florida where this species has been sighted include Glades, Highlands, Polk, Okeechobee, and Osceola counties. Habitat requirements for the Florida grasshopper sparrow are quite specific. Recommended habitat consists of large tracts of poorly drained grasslands with a frequent history of fire and a limited number of trees (less than one tree per acre). Common plant species found in this habitat include bluestem and wiregrass, with occasional saw palmettos as well. As grasshopper sparrows are largely a ground-dwelling species, some bare ground is necessary as well to provide areas for movement and foraging purposes. Florida grasshopper sparrows are the only subspecies of grasshopper sparrow known to breed in the state of Florida. They are known to nest between April and August on the ground at the base of a small shrub or clump of grass. Their nests are often constructed of available plant matter nearby, which mainly consists of the leaves of bluestem and wiregrass. Females are known to lay between 3-5 eggs, and the young fledge about 10 days after hatching. Nest success rates are often quite low, with one study observing success rates of between 10-33% at multiple sites. Only three locations in Florida are now known to definitively support wild populations of the sparrow, and populations are declining in all three. However, there are reports of at least two other subpopulations on private lands, which Audubon Florida plans to acquire or give conservation easements for.  Diet  Florida grasshopper sparrows are omnivores, with most of their diet consisting of insects, such as grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, and moths. Most of the vegetation in the sparrow's diet is made up of sedge seeds and star grass seeds. Florida grasshopper sparrows forage near the ground, and thus, frequent fires are essential to maintain areas of bare ground for foraging.  Population trends  Until large scale surveys were undertaken in the 1980s to determine the abundance and distribution of the subspecies, the number of Florida grasshopper sparrows present in the wild was largely unknown. Following these surveys, it was determined by the US Fish and Wildlife Service that the Florida grasshopper sparrow be listed as endangered on the Endangered Species List. Subsequent surveys performed in the 1990s estimated fewer than 500 adult Florida grasshopper sparrows, and recent work estimates that, under present habitat conditions, there is a 22% chance of extinction of the species within the next 50 years. The survival of the subspecies is highly dependent upon habitat availability, with another model correlating a loss of habitat to a 66% chance of extinction. Based on population trends, the species has been slated to possibly become extinct in the wild as soon as 2018‚Äì2019. Conservation As of 2017, there were an estimated 50-60 Florida grasshopper sparrows left in the wild. This shows a dramatic decline from 2004, when population estimates were 1,000. The population decline is attributed to hatchling predation by invasive fire ants, extreme weather flooding nests, loss of habitat, and competition with non-native species. This decline has prompted the initiation of captive breeding programs by the Rare Species Conservatory Foundation and White Oak Conservation. In 2015, 23 eggs threatened by nest flooding were transported to the Rare Species Conservatory Foundation, where 21 successfully hatched via artificial incubation. By mid- June 2017, White Oak Conservation had produced 18 chicks from 3 pairs of adults that were born in the wild and their five offspring. Captive breeding has been hindered by diseases caused by an infectious gut parasite, though solutions are being worked on. Due to the species' possible extinction in the wild by 2018‚Äì2019, there has been some controversy over what to do with the remaining wild population. Some biologists support capturing all remaining wild individuals and using them in the captive breeding program for genetic diversity, while others state that these individuals should stay in the wild as they are important in studying how this subspecies behaves and survives in nature. On May 9, 2019, FWC announced the planned release of captive-bred sparrows on public lands in Osceola County over the following weeks, in an effort to bolster wild populations currently estimated at fewer than 80 sparrows.
