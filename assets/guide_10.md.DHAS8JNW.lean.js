Fossils have been found along a bank of the Orange River in Namibia, near its border with South Africa. When the species was named in 2003, it was hypothesized to be ancestral to the living Nile crocodile, Crocodylus niloticus. During this time the fossil record of C. niloticus was thought to extend back into the Late Miocene, meaning that \\"C.\\" gariepensis could have been a direct precursor to the species. More recent studies propose that C. niloticus first appeared much more recently, making \\"C.\\" gariepensis an unlikely ancestor of the Nile crocodile. Moreover, the most recent phylogenetic studies of crocodiles place \\"C.\\" gariepensis in an evolutionary position outside most other species of Crocodylus, far from the position of C. niloticus. These studies place it in a clade informally called \\"mecistopins\\", which includes the living slender-snouted crocodile Mecistops and the extinct genus Euthecodon. Since \\"C.\\" gariepensis does not fall within the genus Crocodylus defined in its strictest sense (Crocodylus sensu stricto), its name is shown in quotation marks. Although much of Namibia is currently arid, \\"C.\\" gariepensis lived during a time when the local climate was humid and subtropical. It likely inhabited gallery forests surrounding the Orange River. Fossils of giant tortoises and a variety of small burrowing mammals have been found in the same deposits.

He taught at University of Pennsylvania from 1910 to 1924, and served as a trustee of its School of Fine Arts from 1925 to 1959. McGoodwin was active in the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, serving as its president in 1943. Early life He was born in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and educated in Philadelphia, graduating from Central High School in 1902. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Architecture in 1907, and received an M.A. from Penn in 1908. He won the 1908 Cresson Traveling Scholarship in architecture, which he used to travel in Europe and study in Paris. Career Following his return to Philadelphia, he worked briefly for architect Horace Trumbauer. In 1910, he was commissioned by Dr. George Woodward to design about 180 houses in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia until 1930.Witold Rybczynski, City Life (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1996), p. 187.

He planned \\"French Village\\" (1924‚Äì29) for Woodward - a luxury housing development on the opposite side of the Cresheim Creek, in Mount Airy - and designed eight of its French-Norman-style buildings, including the gatehouses flanking Emlen Street and the gatehouse at McCallum Street.French Village from PlanPhilly. Additional houses were designed by architects Edmund B. Gilchrist and Willing, Sims & Talbutt. McGoodwin created a massive Tudor fantasy in the Samuel B. Rotan mansion, \\"Lane's End,\\" in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania.Wharton Sinkler Estate from Castles Magazine. Now better known as the Wharton Sinkler Estate, it was modeled after Sutton Place in Guildford, Surrey. McGoodwin assembled architectural fragments and whole rooms from numerous English buildings: the massive oak front doors were salvaged from Muchelny Abbey and date to 739; the stone-slab floors of the hall were salvaged from Warwick Priory and date to 1124.Charles G. and Edward C.

The first step in this scheme was the Horace Howard Furness Shakespearean Library addition. The scheme never went any further, and his incongruous addition to the library is now the Arthur Ross Gallery. In 1936, McGoodwin enlarged Penn's student union building, Houston Hall, with a two- story dining hall addition at its east end (now the Hall of Flags)Houston Hall dining hall from Flickr. and a student lounge at its west end. He also made alterations to the University of Pennsylvania Hospital following a 1937 fire. McGoodwin also worked briefly for the Philadelphia Housing Authority in the 1930s, and was one of the architects of the Hill Creek Housing Project. In the 1950s, McGoodwin was commissioned by developer Sam Houston to design single- family homes, duplexes, and apartments for the Andorra development in Roxborough section of Philadelphia.

The Postmaster General has stated that the system is primarily used for mail sorting, though it also enables the USPS to retroactively track mail correspondence at the request of law enforcement. It was created in the aftermath of the 2001 anthrax attacks that killed five people, including two postal workers. The automated mail tracking program was created so that the Postal Service could more easily track hazardous substances and keep people safe, according to U.S. Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed MICT on June 7, 2013, when discussing the Bureau's investigation of ricin-laced letters sent to U.S. President Barack Obama and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. The FBI stated in a criminal complaint that the program was used to narrow its investigation to Shannon Richardson. U.S. Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe confirmed in an interview with the Associated Press the existence of this program on August 2, 2013. In confirming the existence of MICT, Donahoe told the Associated Press that the USPS does not maintain a massive centralized database of the letter images. He said that the images are taken at more than 200 mail processing centers around the country, and that each scanning machine at the processing centers only keeps images of the letters it scans. He also stated the images are retained for a week to 30 days and then destroyed. Computer security and information privacy expert Bruce Schneier compared MICT to the mass surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA), revealed in June 2013 by Edward Snowden. Schneier said, \\"Basically, [the USPS is] doing the same thing as the [NSA] programs, collecting the information on the outside of your mail, the metadata, if you will, of names, addresses, return addresses and postmark locations, which gives the government a pretty good map of your contacts, even if they aren't reading the contents.\\" James J. Wedick, a former FBI agent, said of MICT, \\"It's a treasure trove of information. Looking at just the outside of letters and other mail, I can see who you bank with, who you communicate with ‚Äî all kinds of useful information that gives investigators leads that they can then follow up on with a subpoena.\\" He also said the program \\"can be easily abused because it's so easy to use, and you don't have to go through a judge to get the information. You just fill out a form.\\" The U.S. Postal Service almost never denies requests to track suspects‚Äô mail on behalf of law-enforcement agencies.

The Virgin of Quito (Spanish, La Virgen de Quito) ‚Äî also known as the Virgin of the Apocalypse, Winged Virgin of Quito, Dancing Madonna, and Legarda's Virgin ‚Äî is a wooden sculpture by the Quite√±o artist Bernardo de Legarda (ca. 1700-1773) which has become the most representative example of the Quito School of art, developed in the Ecuadorian capital during the Spanish colonial era. This particular Virgin became a popular cult image which is still venerated ‚Äî via innumerable replicas ‚Äî throughout the northern Andes. The original 1734 work was conceived and commissioned as a Lady of the Immaculate Conception and is venerated at the altar of the Church and Convent of San Francisco in Quito, Ecuador. Description The composition of the 120-centimeter-high sculpture is derived from the biblical description of the Woman of the Apocalypse. As described in the Revelation of Saint John (12:1-2), the woman was ‚Äúclothed in the sun‚Äù. Also in accordance with the text, she has a crescent moon under her feet and a silver diadem bearing 12 stars is on her head. After battling a dragon ‚Äî i.e., Satan, with the apple of original sin in his mouth ‚Äî she has trampled and subdued the beast with a heavy silver chain which she holds loosely in her open hands. She has been given silver wings for escape. Probably influenced by 16th century European prints, such as that of Albrecht D√ºrer‚Äôs Revelation series, the ‚Äúdancing‚Äù Virgin seems to float and gestures with open hands to her right amid an abundance of flouncing folds conveying both flight and ecstasy. Her mantle is of deep blue and bears silver stripes at the bottom. According to Michael Handelsman, \\"unlike the fair-skinned European Virgins, she clearly has the facial features and coloring of a mestiza\\".Handelsman, Michael (2000), Culture and Customs of Ecuador (Series: Culture and Customs of Latin America and the Caribbean; Series editor: Peter Standish); Westport, Connecticut/London: Greenwood Press, pg 128. The work was signed and dated by its creator. A larger version of the work, by the same artist, is venerated in the Catedral de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n (Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption, Popay√°n) in Popay√°n, Colombia. This larger Virgin, known as Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n de Popay√°n (Our Lady of the Assumption of Popay√°n), strikes a more exaggerated ‚Äúdancing‚Äù pose atop a crescent moon and serpent, and prepares to strike the latter with a lightning bolt, which replaces the earlier work's heavy silver chain. Both of these figures carry the iconographic trappings more of the Woman of the Apocalypse than of an ‚ÄúImmaculate Conception‚Äù (the colors [blue and white], the floating) or an ‚ÄúAssumption‚Äù (the wings, the upraised arms), although elements of all three Marian \\"epithets\\" are present. History Legarda had established his reputation when in 1732 he was hired by the Franciscan fathers for the commission of an image of the ‚ÄúVirgin of the Immaculate Conception‚Äù for one of the altarpieces in a side chapel of the Church of San Francisco. Legarda could hardly create his own iconography for such a traditional image as the Immaculate Conception ‚Äî it would not include the Christ child and the colors would have to be white and blue. The completed work was given to the Franciscans on 7 December 1734, which date is visible in the stubs of the hands of the Virgin along with the artist‚Äôs signature. Owing to the impressive beauty and impact of the work, the Franciscans promptly reassigned it to the main altar. The unique positioning of the hands and the flouncing folds of the dress ‚Äî both of which gave an impression of movement ‚Äî soon yielded the nickname ‚ÄúDancing Virgin‚Äù. The unaccountable wings resulted in the sobriquet of \\"Winged Virgin\\". In addition to the larger Popay√°n copy produced by Lagarda himself, countless small devotional images throughout Latin America replicate the famed original sculpture in the Church of San Francisco in Quito. One, produced by the famed artist Caspicara, is in the Brooklyn Museum. The largest copy is the Virgin of El Panecillo, a 45-meter tall statue by the Spanish artist on the hill known as El Panecillo in Quito. Made of aluminum, it has overlooked the city since 1976.

His negotiations with studios resulted in the guild's right to determine film writing credits. He was the younger brother of writer/producer Everett Freeman. Youth and World War II Born in Brooklyn, New York City on February 13, 1913 to Jewish parents, Freeman attended Brooklyn College and began his career writing short stories for The Saturday Evening Post, The New Yorker and the British magazine Punch. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he volunteered for service in the United States Navy, went through officer training and then was assigned to Armed Forces Radio, becoming one of the co-founding members of the Navy unit of Armed Forces Radio, where he wrote training films and entertainment programs for sailors and marines. Career During the war, he had experienced how screenwriters were almost completely ignored by the studio brass and received close to no artistic recognition in movies they wrote. After his discharge from the Navy, he therefore lobbied among fellow writers for the foundation of a Screen Writers organization. In the era of McCarthyism, such efforts were closely observed and met with suspicion. He nonetheless succeeded and became one of the founding members of the Screen Writers' Guild and in 1954 was responsible for its reorganization in the Writers Guild of America. His efforts resulted in securing the right of writers to determine motion picture writing credits and establishing the system under which the guild determines those credits. He later served as secretary-treasurer and board member of the guild, as well as on the board of trustees of the Motion Picture & Television Fund and on the board of the Writers Guild Foundation. In the 1950s and 1960s, Freeman wrote for the radio program The Baby Snooks Show, starring comedian Fanny Brice. When MGM offered him work as a staff writer in Hollywood, he moved to the West Coast and subsequently wrote some 20 motion pictures, including Main Street Lawyer (1939), The Guilt of Janet Ames (1947), The Fuller Brush Man (1948), Miss Grant Takes Richmond (1949), Tell It to the Judge (1949), Borderline (1950), The Yellow Cab Man (1950), Three Sailors and a Girl (1953), Francis in the Navy (1955), The First Traveling Saleslady (1956), Dance with Me, Henry (1956), and The Girl Most Likely (1958). He also wrote the \\"Burglar\\" scene with his brother, Everett, which was used in Ziegfeld Follies (1945). For television, Freeman worked on shows like Playhouse 90 and wrote and produced several series, including The Loretta Young Show. He also created the successful television western series Sugarfoot, starring Will Hutchins. During his years in television, he served as an executive at CBS for three years, responsible for shows like The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Jack Benny Program, I Love Lucy, Sea Hunt, and The Beverly Hillbillies. In later years, he wrote Father Sky, a novel about a military school, that was turned into the 1981 motion picture Taps, starring Timothy Hutton, George C. Scott, Sean Penn and Tom Cruise. Leonard B. Stern, a fellow writer who worked on Get Smart with him, said in a statement by the Writers Guild of America, West: \\"His love of language never went unfulfilled in his writing, and he never exempted himself from the concerns and problems of writers,\\" when announcing Freeman's death on behalf of WGA. Family Freeman, a widower, had sons Seth and Jonathan. In 2006, his son Seth donated his father's extensive archive to the Brooklyn College Library Archive. Death Freeman, who had been in poor health since the 1990s due to cardiac problems, had to undergo open-heart heart surgery in March 2005.

In this piece Wilson documents his use of a personal assistant outsourcing service located in India called GetFriday. The work presents Wilson's relationship with Akhil, his 25-year-old personal assistant. Instead of asking Akhil to complete the tasks he was used to doing for other clients - such as email, finances, and calendar management - Wilson reversed this by asking Akhil to assign him tasks and to come up with ideas for collaborative projects. = Workers Leaving the Googleplex = Andrew Norman Wilson's Viral Video Piece Workers Leaving the Googleplex piece contains footage of two Google locations in Mountain View, California with a voice-over narrative spoken by Wilson. The content for this video came out of Wilson's experience of working at Google in 2007. The piece presents the class structure of Google shown through Wilson's encounter with the yellow-badge workers, a top-secret group of workers that scan books for Google Book Search. The artist's attempts to film and interview the yellow-badge workers were stopped quickly by Google security and resulted in the termination of his employment at Google.

Throughout his nine-decade career, Williams focused on the Great American Songbook and the tenor sax as a solo vehicle. Musical history His first instrument was the violin before switching to the clarinet and then to the tenor saxophone. In 1942 Williams moved to Saint Paul, (Minnesota). In his early career, he played in bands behind Ella Fitzgerald, Fletcher Henderson, Mary Lou Williams, and Billy Eckstine at venues such as the Apollo Theater or the Howard Theater. Turning down invitations to go on tour with Duke Ellington, Count Basie, or Louis Armstrong, he chose to stay and become part of the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul (Twin Cities), history. While teaching in various public schools in St. Paul, he played with the late Reginald Buckner. In the Twin Cities, Williams has played at every jazz venue, past and present, including the old Flame Bar where he was often back to back with such stars as Sarah Vaughan, Dizzy Gillespie, and Johnny Hodges. Since his 84th birthday, Williams came up with a stream of releases: That‚Äôs All (2004), Dedicated to You (2005), followed by one of his most acclaimed, Duo (2006) with piano partner Peter Schimke, and Finality (2008). In 2011, Williams recorded Duke's Mixture, a quintet with Peter Schimke, Steve Blons, Billy Peterson and Jay Epstein; the set list includes five original compositions from Williams and his vocal debut on \\"Until the Real Thing Comes Along\\", together with two Irving Berlin standards and a pair of blues tunes. Irv Williams had a regular weekly gig at the Dakota Jazz Club in downtown Minneapolis. Personal life Williams had nine children from two marriages.

At the time of its entry into service in 2013, it had the largest cargo capacity in TEU of any vessel, and was the longest container ship in service worldwide. Constructed for Maersk by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) of South Korea, it was launched in February 2013 and entered operational service in July 2013. It was named for M√¶rsk Mc-Kinney M√∏ller, the CEO of Maersk between 1965 and 1993. The ship is the first of a class of 20 identical vessels. Design overview Along with its Triple E class sister ships, M√¶rsk Mc-Kinney M√∏ller was the world's largest and most efficient operational container ship at the time of its completion, totalling in length and with a cargo capacity of 18,270 TEU containers. Its efficiency is maximized by fuel-efficient engines and a maximum speed of 23 knots, reducing its fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent compared to the previous most efficient cargo vessel. However, due to its size and cost, its efficiency is severely reduced if it is not fully loaded; the shipping analyst Richard Meade asserts that it is \\"probably the most inefficient ship ever built\\" when half-loaded. During normal operations, the M√∏ller is manned by a crew of 19, although it has sufficient accommodation for 34 people. Career Size comparison of some of the longest ships ever constructed. From top to bottom: Knock Nevis (ex-Seawise Giant), M√¶rsk Mc- Kinney M√∏ller, Vale Brasil, Allure of the Seas, and . The contract for the construction of M√¶rsk Mc-Kinney M√∏ller was signed on 21 February 2011. Work began with a steel cutting ceremony at the DSME shipyard at Okpo, Geoje, South Korea, on 18 June 2012. The hull was laid down on 27 November 2012 and officially launched on 24 February 2013. The M√∏ller left the Daewoo shipyards in an operational capacity in July 2013, whereupon it began sea trials. Initially, it was forced to operate well under its maximum cargo capacity, as most ports certified to handle Triple E class vessels at that time lacked gantry cranes tall enough to fully load the ship. In August 2013, it made its first transit of the Suez Canal. In January 2014, the M√∏ller arrived at its first operational port of call, Singapore. In November 2014, the M√∏ller was superseded as the world's largest container ship by China Shipping Container Lines' CSCL Globe.

History GrabCAD was founded in Estonia in 2009 by current CEO, Hardi Meybaum, and Indrek Narusk as a marketplace to connect engineers with CAD-related jobs. GrabCAD evolved into a community for engineers to share CAD models and moved its HQ to Cambridge, MA in 2011. According to the company site, GrabCAD was founded with the goal of bringing together all the tools engineers need to manage and share CAD files into one platform. On September 16, 2014 GrabCAD was acquired by Stratasys. Stratasys Ltd. is a manufacturer of 3D printers and 3D production systems for office- based rapid prototyping and direct digital manufacturing solutions. Products =Community= GrabCAD began as a Community where engineers could upload and download models from a free CAD library. Today, the Community consists of over 5,220,000 users and is nearing 3,120,000+ open source models. The Community also offers a range of challenges with prizes, from Ultimaker's \\"3D Printer Toy Design Challenge\\" to GE's \\"Jet Engine Bracket Challenge\\", as well as pro bono challenges like ModVic's \\"Steampunk Wheelchair\\" and the \\"Eyes to Hear\\" Challenge. =Workbench= In April 2013, GrabCAD released Workbench, a free cloud-based collaboration solution that helps engineering teams manage, share, and view CAD files. Workbench is used by companies to support the design of physical products ranging from basic screws to jet engine brackets. The idea behind Workbench is to replace costly and complex solutions that engineering teams often use when versions and revisions become hard to track. Workbench allows multiple engineers to work on the same files at the same time without conflict. Workbench also lets engineers share files externally. Workbench is hosted on Amazon's S3 secure server cloud architecture, and has a range of features including viewing of all major CAD file formats, file locking, local folder sync, model comparison, and management of bill of materials and revisions. Workbench users can view 3D models, as well as markup, explode, measure and pin comments, all directly in the browser. =Toolbox= Toolbox was released June 2013, which enables Workbench users to access third-party CAD applications that run on GrabCAD's platform. Currently there are four apps available from Keyshot, Autodesk, IronCAD and Solid Edge, but GrabCAD is focused on drawing in new CAD application developers to grow Toolbox's usefulness to engineers.

It was the highest- numbered combined arms army to be formed by the Stavka during the war. It was active at the Battle of Kursk, the Lublin‚ÄìBrest Offensive, and the Berlin Strategic Offensive, among other actions. Formation The army began forming in October 1942 near Sverdlovsk in Siberia as a separate NKVD Army of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (Stavka Reserve).Walter S. Dunn, Jr.; Stalin's Keys to Victory; Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2007; p 121 It was recruited primarily from NKVD border guards, with other redundant manpower from lines of communications troops and GULAG personnel.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, 1996, pp 38, 39, 54, 65, 71, 73 In a decree signed by Gen. G.K. Zhukov the army became part of the Red Army: The reinforcing and support units included the 27th Separate Tank Regiment and 378th Anti-Tank Regiment. 70th Army was assigned to the re-deploying Don Front (soon re-designated Central Front) under command of Gen. K.K. Rokossovsky. It was some time before Rokossovsky could knock it into shape as a front-line formation, forcing him to remove many senior, ex-NKVD officers.David Glantz, \\"Konstantin Konstantinovich Rokossovsky\\", in Stalin's Generals, (Harold Shukman, Ed.), Phoenix Press, 2001, p 187 From 28 February the 70th Army took part in both offensive and defensive operations to the northwest of Kursk. Central Front exploited a gap between the weak Second German Army and the Second Panzer Army, but was brought to a halt by the spring rasputitsa, German reserves released by their evacuation of the Rzhev Salient, and the German counter-offensive to the south. The Front's armies created defenses in depth during the lull in operations during the spring. Battle of Kursk During the Battle of Kursk the 70th Army fought on the left flank of the 2nd Tank Army and played a role in stopping the German 9th Army that was trying to break through to Kursk from the north.Robin Cross; The Battle of Kursk; Penguin Books, London, 1993; p 166 During the subsequent Red Army counterattack, the 70th Army took part in Operation Kutuzov and attacked Trosna to the south of the town of Kromy. On 5 Aug., its units reached the region southwest of Kromy, and on 17 Aug., they reached the German \\"Hagen\\" defense line near Domakha. After the end of this operation, the field headquarters of the 70th Army was transferred to the Reserve of the Central Front and on 1 Feb. to STAVKA Reserve, where it received new units. Lublin- Brest operation During the second half of February 1944, the 70th Army was transferred to the front at the Turya River north of Kovel. On 25 Feb., it was subordinated to the Belorussian Front and on 16 Apr. it joined that formation, which had been re-designated 1st Belorussian Front. In June, prior to the outbreak of the Soviet summer offensive, the Army was still in the vicinity of Kovel, and its order of battle was as follows: * 96th Rifle Corps (38th Guards and 1st Rifle Divisions) * 114th Rifle Corps (76th Guards and 160th Rifle Divisions) * 376th Anti-tank Artillery Regt., 581st Anti-Aircraft Regt., 136th Guards Mortar Regt., 148th Gun Artillery Brigade, and supporting units. With just four rifle divisions, this was a small army by Soviet standards. It also contained the 3rd Sniper Battalion.Walter S. Dunn, Jr.; Soviet Blitzkrieg; Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2000; pp 209 - 211 During the Lublin‚ÄìBrest Offensive (18 July ‚Äì 2 August), its units, along with units of the 61st Army and the 26th Army, surrounded Brest from the south-east and destroyed up to four German divisions to the west of Brest. Poland After a short period assigned to the front reserves, on 10 Aug. the 70th Army attacked a region to the north of Warsaw. By the end of August, it reached the Narew River near the town of Serock. As of 26 Aug. was reduced to just the 72nd Rifle Corps. p 3 On 29 Oct., the 70th Army was back again as reserves of the 1st Belorussian Front and on 19 Nov. as reserves of the 2nd Belorussian Front. Germany During the East Prussian Offensive (13 January to 25 April), 70th Army attacked from the Serock bridgehead towards Modlin, P≈Çock, and Toru≈Ñ (Thorn). During three days of fighting, its units broke through the German defenses. On 18 January, they captured Modlin and Modlin Fortress. On 25 January, elements of 70th Army reached the fortified city of Toru≈Ñ. At the same time other units of 70th Army reached the Vistula River north-east of Bromberg (Bydgoszcz) and crossed the river against opposition. On 10 February, the 70th Army reduced the defenders in Thorn. 70th Army, together with other armies of the front and forces of Baltic Fleet, took part in the East Pomeranian Offensive (10 February ‚Äì 4 April 1945). The operation captured the city, port, and military naval base of Gdynia on 28 March and the naval base at Danzig (Gdansk) on 30 March. In the beginning of April 1945, 70th Army was transferred to the front reserve. At this time the army had the 66th Guards SU Brigade attached, the Red Army's only heavy SU brigade, a potent force of 60 ISU-122 self-propelled guns.Sharp, \\"Red Hammers\\", Soviet Self-Propelled Artillery and Lend Lease Armor 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. XII, Nafziger, 1998, p 20 On 15 April it was sent to the region of Wittstock, Naugard (Nowogard), and Sztuchow. During the Battle of Berlin (16 April ‚Äì 8 May), 70th Army was attached to the spearheads of 2nd Belorussian Front, attacking on the Neubrandenburg ‚Äì Wismar axis. On 1 May, it captured the cities of Rostock and Teterow. On the evening of 3 May, its units reached the Baltic Sea coastline near Wismar and received orders to guard and defend the coastline near Stettin (Szczecin). Post war After the war, the headquarters of the Army was transferred to Chkalov (Orenburg). In October 1945, the field headquarters and its staff was used to create the headquarters of the South Urals Military District.

He graduated in 1980 from Pennsylvania State University with a degree in Political Science, where he was on the college lacrosse team. Career Previously, Buckhorn was the Director of Governmental Affairs for the Builders Association of Greater Tampa, and in 1987, became the Special Assistant to Mayor Sandra Freedman. In 1995, Buckhorn was elected Tampa City Council and was reelected to the Tampa City Council for a second term with 75% of the vote. =Tampa mayoralty= Having previously come third in the 2003 mayoral election, Buckhorn announced his intention to run again in the Mayoral election, and received an endorsement from outgoing incumbent Pam Iorio. In June 2011, he formed the Economic Competitiveness Committee (ECC) to review the City of Tampa's permitting and regulatory processes and to look for ways to improve the system. The ECC made several recommendations, and the City of Tampa is in the process of instituting those, including the implementation of Accela to allow for permitting to be done online. Through the Invision Tampa plan, Buckhorn outlined his commitment to creating a more connected, livable city by focusing on the city's underutilized riverfront, generating a strong mix-use pedestrian environment, building links between neighborhoods, and developing an urban pattern that supports transit. He has also worked to restore the street grid, foster new retail opportunities, and tried to work to attract new high density residential development such as the Residences on the Riverwalk and Skyhouse Tampa. Buckhorn helped secure a Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery Grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation to complete the Tampa Riverwalk, which has been in the molding process by city officials for more than 40 years. The Riverwalk is part of plans to generate new possibilities for economic development along the Hillsborough River. He has also supported the expansion of mass transit and bike share. Buckhorn was the subject of controversy for aiming a twin .50 caliber machine gun at journalists and pretending to shoot them during a military parade and joking about it afterwards. Buckhorn later apologized to the military journalists for his joke.  Personal life  He is married to Dr. Catherine Lynch Buckhorn and they have two daughters.

The diocese is one among the 22 dioceses of Church of South India in India. History The first missionaries who came to Nandyal were Arthur Inman and Alfred Briton in the year 1881. These two missionaries were responsible to establish the SPG High School in 1884 and to build the Holy Cross Church in 1905 in Nandyal. These two missionaries who resided in Nandyal lived in tents and went about preaching the gospel in and around Nandyal in various villages and building churches. Their mode of travel in those days were bullock carts on most primitive roads or cart tracks. They learned the local language Telugu and traveled extensively beyond Nandyal to place like Kurnool, Giddalur, Kalasapad, Atmakur and Nandikotkur and planted churches in the villages. In this church first SPG Telugu Graduate Priest Rev. David Gnanamuthu served from 1912 to 1923, he came from Medras Christian Theological College, Madras (1885 to 1890) and his son Re. John Yesudas Gnanamuthu served in this diocese.'History of Nandyal Diocese' When Dornakal diocese (of which it was then a part) joined the united Church of South India in 1947, Nandyal instead chose to remain in the Indian Anglican church, under the Diocese of Calcutta. Nandyal diocese was formed on 29 April 1963, initially as part of Church of India (CIPBC); with that church, it united into the Church of North India in 1970, and the Nandyal diocese eventually joined the Church of South India on 6 July 1975.[Constance M.

It is one of the tributaries of the Osmore River (also known as Moquegua or Tumilaca). The Asana archaeological site, occupied over the course of 8,000 years, is situated in a basin on the river's north bank. The Quellaveco mining project sought to divert the Asana for extractive waste material placement in its copper mining operations. Geography The Asana River is one of the four major tributaries of the Moquegua. It is situated in the south central Andes mountains. The main Asana has its primary source at an elevation of . This is within the pampas in the peripheral region of the high puna, defined as an area (Pampa Tinajones and Apachita Limani) above elevation. The river's runoff source is seasonal precipitation including snow melt from the western cordillera of the Andes. One of the Asana's tributaries is the Charaque. After their confluence, the stream becomes known as Coscori. The Capillune is a tributary of the Asana. Below the elevation of , the many tributaries to Asana are generally dry and seasonal but the streams above this elevation demonstrate perennial flows from rainfall and snow melt. Stream discharge during the rainy season averages /second while in the dry season, the average was /second. Ecologically the entire Asana River valley is fragile and subject to landslides. The river flows through two environmental regions. One is the puna region above elevation where the climate is colder and the rainfall is also higher compared to the lower elevation areas. Vegetation and animal species found in the region are similar up to puna rim region in elevation range of . The valleys in this range are narrow. In the flat valley where the Asana archaeological site is located, the geological and geomorphological features are causative factors for its existence. Flora Polylepis rugulosa of the genus Polylepis, trees that grow in the Andes highland region of Peru The lower sierra region () of the Asana river valley has four plant communities; evergreen shrubs and sparsely distributed molle trees (schinus molle); perennial shrubs of Franseria meyeniana; grasses and herbs such as Chenopodium petiolare and grain quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa). Growth and yield of these plants are dependent on the rainfall. The upper high sierra zone () has 14 plant communities. Some of the species are Fabiana weberbauerii, Balbisia-Verbena Diplostephium, Cherodesma and tola (Parastrephia lepidophyllum) ) ) pampa, stipa ichu, quenua (Polylepis besseri), and in the High Sierra ‚Äì Bofedales (Distchia moor). In the puna rim (elevation ), the plant species are in the pampa dryland consisting of pampa and bunch grasses, and wetlands of bofedal and puna desert which is barren land. In the puna rim area, 32 species have been recorded in the dry and wetland areas. The dryland species are bunch grass species of Calamagrostits amonea, Calamagrostits bereifolia, stipa ichu, and shrub species of Parastrephia lepidopyhylum, Parastrephia lucida, Baccharis macrophylla, Chersodoma iodopappa, cactus (Opuntia atacamenis) at high altitudes, two woody plants of Azorella compacta (yareta), Polylepis besseri. The wetland species are mats of Distichia muscoides, Oxychloe andinum (khuli) over which the grasses that flourish are Calamagrostis crysantha and Calamagrostis rigescens. Fauna Taruca (Hippocamelus antisensis) in the northern Andean mountains. There are several herbivores in the Asana valley. Recorded from the pre-historic period, are guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in an elevation range of feeding on grasses, forbs and shrubs, and subsisting in arid conditions. Taruca (Hippocamelus antisensis) is found in elevation up to in scattered forest environment of groves (quenua); they still exist in the valley. Vicuna (Vicugna vicugna) and Lama vicugna are Andean camelids found in the elevation range of ) which forage on vegetation of bofedal in this region. Smaller species found are vizcacha (Lagidium viscacia). Mining In the 1960s, when the Southern Peru Copper Corporation began copper mining in the region, the Asana River valley was tapped for mining operations. The Quellaveco Company (a consortium of Anglo-American Company of South Africa and International Finance Corporation of the World Bank) operated here since 1992. Quellaveco proposed a river diversion project on the Asana River in 2000 which involved the building of a canal which would use per second of water for open pit mining to extract about 64,000 tons of copper, and other minerals, over a forty-year period. However, the environmental impact assessment (EIA) carried out by Quellaveco confirmed the negative impact of this diversion. The EIA suggested that an unacceptable level of water resource exploitation would occur. Other issues noted were resettlement of local population as well as the pollution of aquifers and land area caused by discharge of tailing effluents. During 2002‚Äì03, the local population held protests against the diversion project in view of its large negative impacts. As of 2007, no license had been issued for this project.

The site is situated at an elevation of , with land use documented from . Asana was occupied over the course of 8,000 years; though the inhabitants were initially mobile foragers, long term habitation was marked at a later phase by residential architecture. Taruca (Hippocamelus antisensis) in the northern Andean mountains. Geography Asana is located on the north bank of the Asana River in the flat fertile valley along of the river. The geological and geomorphological features are causative factors for its unique setting. History An archaeological study of the Asana river valley was conducted 1986‚Äì89. The area studied was along a river length of about , between Tumilaca Molina and Cueva Quellaveco and from the origin of the minor tributary of the river Charoque to Tala village. The valley floors and hill slopes, covering an area of , led to the discovery of the Asana site and also six rock shelters. One of the rock shelters, Qusquri (Coscori), was discovered on the left bank of the river valley at an elevation of , in a series of river terraces at an elevation range of . Human habitation has been traced to 10,500 BP at Asana. Excavations have revealed six stratigraphic zones from 10,500 BP to 3500 BP, before the site became abandoned in 3500 BP. The period from 10,500 BP to 9,000 BP is interpreted as belonging to the Late Pleistocene age, 800 years prior to any type of permanent habitation in other areas of the south central Andean highlands. During the settlement period, guanaco (Lama guanicoe) and taruka (Hippocamelus antisensis) were the local wild herbivores. Over the centuries, the guanaco were domesticated. The Asana at the lower elevation had formed the base camp of the earliest settlers who were hunter gatherers, hunting guanaco and taruca. Up to 5000 BP, settlement became more permanent. The gradual change from forager over to the pastoral society was recorded between 4800 and 4400 BP. By Middle Halocene age, guanacos had been domesticated. In the river valley, the pastorals living in the mountainous region preferred to limit their livestock foraging to a comfortable distance of not more than with an elevation difference of , perhaps to conserve their energy expenditures. If these limits increased then they would establish new camps. Human settlement abruptly ended at Asana. Archaeological finds 191x191px Lithic material found at the site attests to the shifting of camps and supports links existing between the settlements of the lower and upper elevations. Both residential and non-residential structures were found and indicated a complex type of growth and occupancy. Structure were dated between 5500‚Äì3600 BP. A ceremonial structure was found in an open air pre-ceramic site during excavations conducted from 1989‚Äì90. It is inferred that activities occurred at the ceremonial site during a 250‚Äì500-year period; it is the earliest structure noted of the Kotosh Religious Tradition.

It has been an arts centre but is intended to become a municipal museum. History The hospital was built with the patronage of Father Tom√°s del Valle who in 1748 was the Bishop of C√°diz and Ceuta. The hospital was required because the existing military hospital could not handle the long staying cases. The cost was met by the diocese and by popular contributions. Within four years some rooms were complete and the adjoining chapel, Chapel of La Caridad was ready by 1754 but the hospital itself was not finished until 1768. The hospital had two storeys build around two courtyards with one on them serving as a graveyard.

Randolph was selected to be one of the first African American Electors in the United States at the 1868 Republican National Convention for the Ulysses Grant Republican presidential ticket. Randolph also served as the chair of the state Republican Party Central Committee. He was a delegate to the 1868 South Carolina Constitutional Convention, where he played an important role in establishing the first universal public education system in the state, and in granting for the first time the right to vote to black men and non-property owning European-American men. On October 16, 1868, Randolph was assassinated by members of the KKK. Early life Benjamin Franklin Randolph was born in Kentucky in 1820, the child of free African Americans. He moved with his family to Ohio as a child, where he attended school in Warren County, Ohio. He enrolled in Oberlin Preparatory & Collegiate in 1854 and matriculated at Oberlin College in 1857, studying in the Classics Department. In 1858, he moved to Buffalo, New York, where he served as the principal of a public school for black students. Civil war service In December 1863, Randolph volunteered to serve in Civil War for the Union, joining the 26th Regiment Infantry U.S. Colored Troops at Rikers Island, New York, serving as its chaplain. The only African American officer in the 26th, he received the Regimental banner from Vincent Colyer at the unit's commissioning ceremony on March 27, 1864. Thornton Chase was a commanding officer in the 26th USCT. The unit was deployed to Beaufort, South Carolina, in March 1864, and participated in actions at the Battle of John's Island in the first week of July, sustaining 97 casualties. The unit also fought at the Battle of Honey Hill, and the Battle of Tulifinny. As Chaplain, Randolph's duties included writing letters for members of the regiment and assisting the regimental hospital attendant, Noah Elliott, with care of the sick and wounded. The regiment was mustered out in South Carolina in August 1865. Reconstruction Colors for 26th Regiment Infantry, U.S. Colored Troops After his unit disbanded, Randolph chose to remain in South Carolina during Reconstruction. He attended the Colored People's Convention in Charleston in 1865, subsequently joining the Freedmen's Bureau, serving as assistant superintendent for education in Charleston. In seeking a position with the Bureau, Randolph had written: > I am desirous of obtaining a position among the freedmen where my > qualifications and experience will admit of the most usefulness. I don't ask > position or money. But I ask a place where I can be most useful to my race. > My learning and long experience as a teacher North, and my faithful service > as Chaplain demand that I seek such a place. If you should obtain for me > some responsible position in the Freedmen's Bureau...you would never regret > it. -- B. F. Randolph As assistant superintendent, he established schools for freedmen on various plantations around Charleston and secured teachers for them. Randolph also toured established schools throughout the state to review their operations and ensure they were adequately staffed and supplied. Schools visited included those in Columbia, Camden, Darlington, Cheraw, and Marion, SC. in February 1867, Randolph started the Charleston Advocate, a weekly newspaper for freedmen, co-founding it with Rev. E. J. Adams, and serving as its co-editor. In March 1867, Randolph petitioned to and was accepted on a provisional basis by the South Carolina Mission Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church as a minister of their church. Randolph had trained as a minister in the Presbyterian Church in Ohio (Old School, Northern), but believed that he could more effectively serve freedmen in South Carolina under the auspices of the M. E. church's Mission Conference. In late 1867 Randolph was elected as a delegate to the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1868 under the Reconstruction Laws set by the U. S. Congress. At the Convention, he wrote the article that authorized the first system of free public education in the state. He also authored language granting for the first time the right to vote to landless men, both black and white. Prior to 1868, landless white men were disfranchised. He also successfully introduced an ‚Äúequal protection clause‚Äù, regardless of race, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which South Carolina would ratify the following year. Subsequent to the Convention, Randolph ran for the Orangeburg seat in the State Senate and was elected to a 4-year term. He was also selected by the Republican membership as Chair of the Republican Central Committee for the state, was a delegate to the 1868 Republican National Convention which nominated Ulysses S. Grant for President, and was one of the nation's first African American Electors. Assassination Benjamin F. Randolph, Harper's Weekly, October 25, 1868 As state senator and Republican committee officer, Randolph traveled throughout the state to campaign on behalf of both state and national candidates. In October 1868 he conducted a train tour to the upcountry region of South Carolina on behalf of the national Republican ticket (Randolph was still in the beginning of his 4-year term as state senator and was not standing for re-election). He gave a campaign speech in Abbeville, South Carolina, on October 15. The next day he took a train for Anderson. While changing trains at Hodges' Depot in Hodges, South Carolina, Randolph was gunned down on the station platform by three white men. The attack occurred in broad daylight, with many witnesses, and the assailants mounted their horses and rode away without pursuit. The county coroner's inquest found that no attacker could be identified. Randolph was buried in Columbia, South Carolina, because it was felt that feelings ran too high in Charleston. A subsequent investigation by the state authorities resulted in a warrant being issued in Columbia for the arrest of D. Wyatt Aiken, a former Confederate Army colonel and prominent planter who lived nearby in Cokesbury, South Carolina. Aiken had publicly issued threats against Randolph's life which had been reported by the federal military authority in the region. Aiken was arrested by state constables on November 9, 1868, and briefly detained on suspicion as an accessory before the fact, but was released on $5,000 bail on November 12, and was never brought to trial. Aiken subsequently wrote an open letter to the state Governor published in the Charleston Daily News on November 19, 1868, disputing the authority of the state Constable to arrest him and claiming that he was feloniously incarcerated in Columbia for two days. On December 23, 1868, state constables arrested Fletcher Hodges of Hodges Station as an accessory to the murder of Randolph. He was also subsequently released and never brought to trial. There were again protests in the press that the state Constable lacked jurisdiction in Abbeville County. In 1870, Congress conducted a series of hearings with respect to the political situation in South Carolina under Reconstruction. Included in the committee report was the testimony of a man who came forward and confessed to involvement in the assassination, and who testified that he belonged to a group whose goal was to ‚Äúkill out the leaders of the Republican Party and drive them out of the state.‚Äù The committee taking testimony identified this group as the Ku Klux Klan The witness identified Col. Aiken as a leader in the community but did not tie him directly to the assassination, although his testimony did implicate Fletcher Hodges. The witness, listed in Congressional records as William Tolbert, had surrendered himself to a state constable and was held in the state penitentiary. Subsequent to his testimony, he disappeared from the jail, was declared to have escaped, and was shot by a constable on December. 3, 1869, near Greenwood, South Carolina, a few miles from Hodges Station. No one was ever brought to trial for Randolph's murder. Legacy The 1868 Constitution that Randolph helped create was replaced in 1895 by a Constitution that greatly reduced voting and legal rights for African Americans. Nonetheless, several innovations introduced by Randolph were retained, in particular free public education and the franchise for landless men, as well as the ‚Äúequal protection of the law‚Äù clause. Benjamin Randolph's body was re-buried in 1871 at a cemetery in Columbia established in his honor and named for him. Eight other Reconstruction-era African-American legislators were later buried at Randolph Cemetery, as well as bishops, attorneys, and Columbia's first black postmaster. In 1995, the cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2008, the 140th anniversary of the 1868 Constitutional Convention to which Randolph was a delegate, the 117th Session of the South Carolina General Assembly declared February 2, 2008, as ‚ÄúSenator Benjamin Franklin Randolph Day‚Äù in conjunction with the unveiling of a historic marker at Randolph Cemetery in his honor.

The river has its origin in the snow peaks of the Chuqi Ananta and Arundane mountains, at an elevation of (above sea level). It changes names as it descends from the Andes: From its origin it is called the Moquegua, then Osmore in the middle valley as Rio Coscori and Rio Tumilaca including where the river disappears into subterranean channels, and further down in the lower reaches as Rio Ilo. An initial reconnaissance of the archaeological treasures of the valley carried out in the 1980s revealed more than 500 archeological sites dated from 10,000 years of human occupation. The Asana archaeological site, occupied over a period of 8,000 years, is located by the Asana River, a tributary of the Osmore. There are also Wari culture sites, and the Tiwanaku culture sites in the area; this is where these two cultures came in contact. Geography The river basin is situated within Moquegua Region's Mariscal Nieto and Ilo provinces. It is geographically located between parallels 16 ¬∫ 52 'and 17 ¬∫ 43' south latitude and between the meridians 70 ¬∫ 26 'and 71 ¬∞ 20' west longitude. The hydrographic system is part of the Pacific slope. The river flows along a geological fault known as Cholo fault, and flows over a length of draining an area of (of which are in a wet basin, located above ). It debouches in to the Pacific after dropping over a height of over in its short stretch of from the source and thus having a river gradient of 3.6% (close to a highway gradient). It has several tributaries which have their origin in the western cordillera. Moquegua Valley in Peru. The river basin is bounded on the north by the Tambo River basin, which is a sub-basin of the Vizcachas River; on the east and south, with the Locumba River basin; and on the west by the Pacific Ocean and the region between Moquegua and Tambo, formed by a series of short and medium streams. From north to south the tributaries are: the Huraicane River (also called Otora) with a drainage area of over a flow length of ; the Torata River (Quilancha River) draining in a river length of ; and the Moquegua (Tumilaca), the largest tributary with basin area of , which has two tributaries, the Coscori (formed by the Asana River and the Chareque) and the Capallune, flowing over a length of only. The upper Osmore drainage is known as the Otora Valley. The middle section of the river came into prominence as Moquegua valley (formed by the lower tributaries) during the colonial rule and the town of the same name Moquegua was established. The lower end of the mid valley is where the river disappears from an elevation of about without any trace of either of the river or any habitation traces of pre-Hispanic or Hispanic colonial rule, and reappears short of the coast. Here it becomes a wide valley and flows through the town of Ila. In its last stretch, the river is joined by another stream which brings in the desert wash of the Quebrada Seca de Guaneros, a stream which drains over a stream length of . Many springs in the lower valley (broad valley with flood plains developed for agriculture) were tapped for irrigation development and the river in the lower section in the coastal valley is known by the ancient name of Rio Ilo (Ilo River) with coast line occupied by villages of fishermen. Hill side of the Peruvian Ausangate mountain. The upper section of the Osmore contains several valleys. The midsection contains farmland, the city of Moquegua, the historical Tiwanaku town of Omo, and the Yaral site. It is here that the river disappears into underground channels, leaving behind a gorge. The floodplains initial are narrow, averaging in width, while the latter average in width when arriving at the sea. The presence of the Tiwanaku state's existence in the Moquegua Region was determined in 1981, with 17 sites located in the Osmore drainage area. The small settlement of Pacocha was built at the mouth of the river. In the late 19th century, high tides of the Pacific Ocean flooded the town, and the residents relocated to Ilo, on higher ground. Ecological features The ecological features of the valley above elevation is dictated by the rainfall, which is seasonal. However, at lower elevations rainfall is almost nil and hence considered as the \\"world's driest desert, where decades can pass without even a shower.\\" In the upstream reaches of the valley, the Asana River is one of the four major tributaries of the Moquegua (Tumilaca) River, which becomes the Osmore River downstream. It is situated in the south central Andes mountains. The main Asana has its primary source at an elevation of . This is within the pampas in the peripheral region of the high puna, defined as an area (Pampa Tinajones and Apachita Limani) above elevation. The river's run off source is seasonal precipitation including snow melt from the western cordillera of the Andes. At these high altitudes population was sparse and herding the llama and alpaca was popular. The plantation of potatoes, a frost-tolerant crop, was widely practiced at these altitudes. Below the elevation of , the many tributaries to Asana River are generally dry and seasonal but the streams above this elevation demonstrate perennial flows from rainfall and snow melt. Stream discharge during the rainy season averages /second while in the dry season, the average was /second. Ecologically the entire Asana River valley is fragile and subject to landslides. The river flows through two environmental regions. One is the puna region above elevation where the climate is colder and the rainfall is also higher compared to the lower elevation areas. Vegetation and animal species types found in the region are similar up to puna rim region in elevation range of . The valleys in this range are narrow. In the flat valley where the Asana archaeological site was located, the geological and geomorphological features are causative factors for its existence. Economy Stalleite picture of the Toquepala copper mine The valley has fertile land where the dominant crops grown are grapes (from 1970s), corn (maize), pepper (aji), and cotton. Ilo area (coastal area) is an area of economic prosperity, more pronounced since the 16th century because of its agricultural (olives groves) and fisheries development and shipping. In spite of water shortage in the coastal belt some olive groves are still farmed. Grapes from the valley are brewed to the well known brand of Pisco brandy. A major economic activity in the region the large porphyry copper Miningmine known as the Toquepala mine, located the Tacna Province, Tacna Department, Peru. The mine is an open-pit mine producing copper, molybdenum, rhenium and silver with minor gold and zinc. Archaeological studies Archaeological research not only covered the Asana in the higher reaches of the river in the Sierra but also in the Middle Horizon (500-1000AD) and the lower valley pre-Hispanic sites. An important archaic cave discovered in the Osmore Basin is the Toquepala Caves (at elevation). This cave became famous after copper was found in the valley and South Peru Copper Corporation started exploration of the Cuajone mines. The cave was studied in 1963 at the initiative of South Peru Copper Corporation (as they found large cache of artifacts during their mining operations) funded the study of the paintings in the caves by archeologists from Lima) by Jorge C. Muelle which led to the discovery of the rupestral art. The caves have rock art of hunter-gatherers who are inferred to have lived 10,000 years ago. The Toquepala Caves (two caves) are located near the Quebrada Cimarron, which is a dry stream flowing from the Sierra to the desert. There are more than 50 rock paintings of inhabitants of the caves of the Palaeolithic age. The rock art depicts hunting scenes with armed men hunting the animal guanaco, and they are painted in seven colours. This art was at its peak when the Collawa ethnic group lived here during the paleolithic or stone age period. This was followed by a number of investigations of the many river terraces that exist between elevation . The explorations were launched in subsequent years covering the upper areas of the basin of Asana and its tributaries. For these archaeological investigations, the Contisuyu Program has been established. It is a joint effort of the Field Museum of Lima, the Peruvian Museum of Health Sciences, and the Peruvian National Cultural Institute supported by the South Peru Copper Corporation with the objective of investigating, conserving, and promoting regional cultural heritage of Moquegua's portion of Contisuyu. =Cerro Baul= Cerro Ba√∫l, the archaeological site located on the flat top of a hill, in Moquegua The earliest historical record is of the Cerro Baul, an imposing mesa, or a rocky peak in the middle of the Moquegua Valley and which overlooks the valley. A city once existed on this peak, now ruined. Early on, Cerro Baul was a major center for the Wari culture; it flourished between AD 600 and 1000. This is where the Wari came in contact with the Tiwanaku empire of the same time. Although both cultures maintained defensible hilltop settlements, there is no indication that they were at war with each other.Patrick Ryan Williams, Donna J. Nash, Clash of the Andean Titans: Wari and Tiwanaku at Cerro Ba√∫l (PDF) fieldmuseum.org Around 600 AD, the Wari brought large numbers of settlers to Cerro Baul and region. On the other hand, the earlier Tiwanaku settlement here was mostly in the lower reaches of the Moquegua river valley. Later on, there was more cooperation between them. Cerro Mejia is another site adjacent to Cerro Ba√∫l. It is surrounded by multiple walls.Moseley et al. 1991 Cerro Trapiche was another a Wari/Huaracane site in the middle valley near Tiwanaku settlements; it includes a walled hill peak with slingstone caches.Green and Goldstein 2010 After 1000, both Tiwanaku and Wari had abandoned their Moquegua settlements, and by 1100, the sister states had entirely collapsed. The Chiribaya culture persisted along the lower and middle sections of the Osmore River until about 1400 CE. There were considerable similarities between the Wari and Tiwanaku religious iconographies as found by archaeologists; this suggests intimate contact between the Wari and Tiwanaku. There was also Tiwanaku influence on hybrid Wari keros vessels.Patrick Ryan Williams, Michael E. Moseley, & Donna J. Nash, Empires of the Andes: A Majestic Frontier Outpost Chose Cooperation Over War. Scientific American Discovering Archaeology, 2000 The Inca period Later on, the Inca invaded the area. The local inhabitants took refuge on the rocky cliff as they could not fight the large army of the Incas. When emperor Mayta Capac of the Inca attacked the area he surrounded the hill as the local residents had moved to the safety of the Cerro Baul cliff, which could be approached by a tortuous route. After 50 days of siege when the inhabitants of Moquegua did not get any food or water, they surrendered voluntarily after they ascertained that Mayta Capac would not harm them at all. Now the ruins of the store houses and other remnant structures of the original inhabitants (not of Incas) are seen here in the backdrop of the snow-covered peaks of the Andes. Archeologists have identified several plazas and large buildings in a packed condition in the core area, deep storage pits of granaries and water storage cisterns, grindstones (weighing more than ), and shreds of pottery scattered all over the area. From the top of the Baul, Cuajone open pit copper mine is seen. This mine location is the origin of the Rio Moquegua. Now the \\"citadel city of Cerro Baul\\" (covering an area of ) is witness to some ancient architecture with many ruins containing large cache of artifacts, designed textiles, and mummified human remains. Desolate untended agricultural terraces are seen on the slopes of the mountain with canals leading to the desert plains. =Agricultural terraces= On both sides of the river valley agricultural terraces abutting the hills and with canal systems are seen in an abandoned state. They are locally named as andenes while the entire region of the caldebara is under the Andes system. Farmed terraces are features of the hill slopes of the region even now but the area under farming is much less than it existed in the pre-historic times, while the barren terraces still exist. One unanswered feature is the reason for the abandoned status of the terraces. =Torata= Torata is another ancient settlement in the Sierra mountains, where the local inhabitants moved from the Cerro Baul, after Incas had forced them to do so. The locale has large terrace systems and is also \\"a complex of monumental architecture\\". There is an altiplano (not seen in the coastal belt) Chulpas. The altiplano has stone storehouses of the Inca deserted 500 years ago). A fortified village is also seen here where the architecture and pottery culture is juxtaposed over the local culture. An Inca administrative center is also seen next to this village. Torata was the scene of The battle of Torata which was part of the Peruvian War of Independence that took place 19 January 1823 in the high Torata (town located northeast of Moquegua) between the Liberation Army of Peru, under the command of Argentinean General Rudecindo Alvarado, and Royal Army of Peru under Gen. Brigadier Jer√≥nimo Vald√©s. The war ended with the defeat of patriots whose army was completely routed two days later at the Battle of Moquegua with support of Gen Jos√© de Canterac. =Moquegua= A view of modern Moquegua. Moquegua is now modern city in the valley in the lower reaches of the river. In this valley, canal systems and irrigated agriculture are well developed and are productive. Population is dense and along the river banks as the area is desertic. Middens found here give a clue to the type of crops grown in the past. In the past, the agricultural lands were used to grow maize, beans, cotton, and fruit trees of avocado which are now replaced by grapes which are brewed to make the popular Pisco brandy. Located in the Moquegua Region, of Moquegua is now the regional capital. It is also the capital of Mariscal Nieto Province and Moquegua District. It is located ) south from the capital city of Lima. =Ilo= Ilo, a port town Ilo is the city on the coast where olive orchard are still seen in some locations, a heritage of the past civilization . Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the area was populated by the Chiribaya civilization. Water is very scarce here. The smelter plant of the South Peru Copper Corporation is located close to the city and the water supply needs for this plant are provided from desalinized sea water subject to treatment in the desalination plants. Fishing and collection of marine resources have been a tradition here. It is now the largest port city in the Moquegua Region.

It borders Torfaen and Newport to the west; Herefordshire and Gloucestershire to the east; and Powys to the north. The largest town is Abergavenny, with other large towns comprising Chepstow, Monmouth, and Usk. The present county was formed under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, and comprises some sixty percent of the historic county. Between 1974 and 1996, the county was known by the ancient title of Gwent, recalling the medieval Welsh kingdom. The county is 850 km2 (330 sq mi) in extent, with a population of 93,600. In the United Kingdom, the term \\"listed building\\" refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance. Listing was begun by a provision in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. Once a building is listed, strict limitations are imposed on the modifications allowed to its structure or fittings. In Wales, authority for listing under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 lies with Cadw. Listed buildings are categorised into three grades: :* Grade I ‚Äì buildings of exceptional interest, only 2.5% of listed buildings in England and Wales are Grade I; :* Grade II* ‚Äì buildings of particular importance with more than special interest, 5.8% of listed buildings in England and Wales are Grade II*; :* Grade II ‚Äì buildings of special interest; 91.7% of all listed buildings in England and Wales are in this class. There are 53 Grade I listed buildings in Monmouthshire.The British Listed Buildings online (BLBO) site records 54 listed buildings, as it has two entries for the Old Wye Bridge, Chepstow. It is not uncommon for bridges to have two listings when, as at Chepstow, one end of the bridge is in one country and the other in another. BLBO records the listing for the English end of the bridge (Entry 8, HE 1101561) as 'Chepstow Bridge', and the listing for the Welsh end (Entry 47, Cadw 2479) as 'Road Bridge over River Wye'. These consist of twenty-four churches, a priory and an abbey, eight castles, seven houses, two bridges, a barn, a cross, a farm, a folly, a gatehouse, a hotel, a municipal building, a stables, and two elements of town walls. The journalist Simon Jenkins notes the county's \\"fine collection\\" of castles, mostly dating from the Norman invasion of Wales, and describes Chepstow as \\"the glory of medieval south Wales\\". The castle at Raglan is later, dating from the mid-fifteenth century. The fortified bridge over the River Monnow at Monmouth is the only remaining fortified river bridge in the country with its gate tower standing on the bridge, and has been described as \\"arguably the finest surviving medieval bridge in Britain\\". Monmouthshire has a more \\"modest\\" range of churches, although that at Bettws Newydd has \\"perhaps the most complete rood arrangement remaining in any church in England and Wales\\". The county's Grade I listed abbey, at Tintern, became a focal point of the Wye Tour in the late-eighteenth century. The Monmouthshire writer and artist, Fred Hando, chronicled the history of the county in some 800 newspaper articles written between the 1920s and the 1960s and published in the South Wales Argus, focusing on \\"the little places of a shy county\\". Among the Grade I listed structures Hando described were \\"the tallest house in Monmouthshire\\" at Treowen, \\"the most crooked church in Britain\\" at Cwmyoy, and the Arts and Crafts sgraffito at Llanfair Kilgeddin. Notable people associated with Monmouthshire's Grade I listed buildings include Henry V, born at Monmouth Castle in 1387; the medieval soldier and statesman William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who undertook major construction at Chepstow Castle; and Henry Somerset, 1st Marquess of Worcester, who entertained his king at Raglan, and lost the castle at the end of the First English Civil War. William Wordsworth undertook the Wye Tour in 1798, composing Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey during his visit, and Walter Savage Landor sought, unsuccessfully, to establish a landed estate at Llanthony Priory. Archdeacon Coxe's record of his journey to Llanthony in the spring of 1799 provides an illustration of the hazards of travelling in Wales at this time: \\"I would not recommend timid persons to pass this way in a carriage, for in the whole course of my travels, I seldom met with one more inconvenient and unsafe\\". In 1840, the Chartist leader John Frost and two colleagues were tried at the Shire Hall in Monmouth and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered, the last such sentences to be passed in Britain.The sentences were subsequently commuted to transportation for life. A statue in front of the Shire Hall commemorates Charles Stewart Rolls, the aviator and entrepreneur who was the first Briton to be killed in a plane crash. The architecture of the county was first systematically covered by William Coxe in his two-volume, An Historical Tour in Monmouthshire, published in 1801. Coxe's Preface explains the Tour's genesis; \\"The present work owes its origin to an accidental excursion in Monmouthshire, in company with my friend Sir Richard Hoare, during the autumn of 1798. I was struck with the picturesque ruins of ancient castles, and I was animated with the view of mansions distinguished by the residence of illustrious persons\\". A detailed county history was undertaken by Sir Joseph Bradney, in his A History of Monmouthshire from the Coming of the Normans into Wales down to the Present Time; published in the early 20th century. More recent studies include those of the architectural historian John Newman, in his Gwent/Monmouthshire volume of the Pevsner Buildings of Wales series; and, most exhaustively, by Sir Cyril Fox and Lord Raglan, in their three-volume study, Monmouthshire Houses. The last was described by the architectural historian Peter Smith as \\"one of the most remarkable studies of vernacular architecture yet made in the British Isles, a landmark, in its own field, as significant as Darwin's Origin of Species\\".

Simpson was born in Inverness in the Scottish Highlands. His parents worked for the aluminum maker Alcan, and he grew up with his family on the company estate in the Highlands. When he was 20 years old, he traveled to Australia and found work as an extra for the 1988 film A Cry in the Dark that starred Meryl Streep. Simpson worked with the film's dingo trainer for three weeks and continued working as an extra and as an animal training assistant. He eventually moved to Vancouver, British Columbia and worked for Creative Animal Talent. He moved to Calgary, Alberta in 1994 and currently lives there on a ranch with Sousa. Their company Instinct for Film has trained \\"birds, bears, leopards and small animals\\" for films and advertisements. Simpson has trained animals over numerous television shows and over , including Final Destination (2000), Elf (2003), and Borat (2006). When Simpson and his company were hired to train wolves in Siberia for a French film called Loup (French for \\"Wolf\\"), the trainer decided to film the training process. Using the footage, he produced the documentary Wolves Unleashed, which screened at several film festivals. His biggest project to date was Wolf Totem (2015), for which he trained wolves. After he completed his work on Wolf Totem, he used footage from his three-year experience to begin producing a follow-up documentary, Wolves Unleashed: China. In the 2010s, he also trained a wolf for the TV series Game of Thrones (the character Jon Snow's direwolf Ghost) and wolves for The Revenant.

Freeman is senior educational liaison to Music in the Air (MITA) at UCLA, and serves on the board of the National Center for Human Performance at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas. Life and career Born into a family of musicians, Freeman grew up in Needham, Massachusetts and attended Milton Academy. His paternal grandfather played trumpet and cornet in Sousa's Band. His father was a double bass player in the Boston Symphony Orchestra, ultimately principal bass. In his youth he studied the oboe with Fernand Gillet in addition to studying the piano with Gregory Tucker. He went on concurrently to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in music with highest honors from Harvard and a diploma in piano performance from the Longy School of Music in 1957. He also studied privately with Artur Balsam and Rudolf Serkin during the summers of 1955 and 1956. In 1957‚Äì58 he held one of Harvard's Sheldon Travelling Fellowships. He went on to pursue graduate studies at Princeton where he was awarded both a MFA and PhD in musicology. A Fulbright Scholarship enabled him to pursue further studies in Vienna in 1960‚Äì1962. He was also awarded a Martha Baird Rockefeller Foundation Award in 1962 and later an honorary doctorate from Hamilton College. In 1984 he was awarded Rochester, New York's Civic Medal, in connection with his work on downtown development.

Sanderson was born in Bowling Green, Missouri and educated at the Art Institute of Chicago under Raoul Josset. He moved to Bisbee, Arizona for his health in 1932, where he worked as an illustrator and sign painter. His first major commission was the Miner's Monument at the Cochise County Courthouse in Bisbee, popularly known as the Copper Man, as well as some reliefs in the interior of the courthouse. He moved to Phoenix in 1937 to teach at the Phoenix Art Center under sponsorship by the Works Progress Administration. In 1939 he was commissioned by industrialist Rufus Riddlesbarger to outfit and decorate his new house at Riddlesbarger's Lanteen Ranch near Sierra Vista. Sanderson received several significant commissions starting in 1940. Working for the United States Maritime Commission, Sanderson sculpted a series of wood relief panels for three ships, the President Jackson, President Monroe, and the President Hayes. He worked as an illustrator and model maker for the Goodyear Aircraft Corporation from 1942 to 1946. In 1946-47 he designed furniture, and from 1947 to 1954 he taught at Arizona State College. Other jobs included work as an illustrator for Motorola in 1957-58 and he was a model maker for the Arizona Highway Department in 1962-1965. Through the entire period he worked on commissioned projects and his own artwork. He received notice in 1973 with a retrospective exhibition at Arizona State University. Sanderson's work is described as non-representational, modern, and derived from the landscape and culture of the American Southwest.

At the time of the 1967 Tour de France, he was the undisputed leader of the British team. In the 13th stage of that race, he collapsed and died during the ascent of Mont Ventoux. Simpson fell ill with diarrhoea during the Tour's tenth stage. He was under pressure from his personal manager to continue in the race, though members of his team encouraged him to quit. Near the summit of Mont Ventoux, Simpson fell off of his bike but was able to get back on it. After riding a short distance further, he collapsed. He was pronounced dead after being airlifted to a hospital. The post-mortem examination found that Simpson had taken amphetamine and alcohol, a diuretic combination which proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and the stomach complaint. Approximately 5,000 people came to Simpson's funeral service. A memorial stands close to the spot where he died and has become a pilgrimage for many cyclists. At the Harworth and Bircotes Sports and Social Club, there is a museum dedicated to Simpson's memory. Background Tom Simpson c. 1966 Going into the 1967 Tour de France, Simpson was determined to make an impact. He was in his eighth year as a professional cyclist and wanted to earn as much money as possible before retiring. Simpson was optimistic that he could finish high in the general classification, securing larger appearance fees from post-Tour criteriums. His plan was to either finish in the top three or wear the leader's yellow jersey; he had targeted three key stages, one of which included the thirteenth over Mont Ventoux, riding safe until the race reached the mountains. The 1967 Tour was contested by national teams rather than trade teams. Simpson was the undisputed leader of the British team, one of the weakest in the race. Four team members had experience in top-level racing and six were riding the Tour for the first time. This could have been seen as a handicap, but Simpson was not guaranteed the leadership of his trade team, Peugeot-BP-Michelin, and would have to compete with Frenchman Roger Pingeon ‚Äì the winner of the 1967 Tour. After the first week, Simpson lay in sixth place overall, leading the favourites. As the race crossed the Alps, Simpson fell ill, across the Col du Galibier, with diarrhoea and stomach pains. He was not able to eat and rode on reserves, finishing in 16th place and dropping to seventh overall, with his rivals ahead. He placed in 39th position on stage 11 and 7th on 12. In Marseille, on the evening of 12 July 1967 on stage 12, his personal manager, Daniel Dousset, put Simpson under pressure to produce good results. However, his friend and teammate on the British team, Vin Denson, advised Simpson to limit his losses and settle with what he had; his Peugeot manager, Gaston Plaud, asked Simpson to quit the race even though he had no authority to do so. Death The thirteenth stage (13 July) of the 1967 Tour measured ; it started in Marseille, crossing Mont Ventoux (the \\"Giant of Provence\\") before finishing in Carpentras. At dawn, Tour doctor Pierre Dumas met journalist Pierre Chany near his hotel. Dumas noted the warm temperature: \\"If the boys stick their nose in a 'topette' [bag of drugs] today, we could have a death on our hands\\". At the start line, a journalist noticed Simpson looked tired and ask him if the heat was the problem. Simpson replied, \\"No, it's not the heat, it's the Tour.\\" The -high Mont Ventoux, where Simpson died on 13 July 1967, aged 29. As the race reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpson's team mechanic, Harry Hall, witnessed a still ill Simpson putting the lid back on his water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official) Jacques Lohmuller later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed to stay in the front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for the way he was going up the mountain than for the way he would go down the other side. One kilometre from the summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Taylor and Hall arrived in the team car to help him. Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop when he fell, saying, \\"Come on Tom, that's it, that's your Tour finished.\\" But Simpson said he wanted to go on. Taylor was informed and said, \\"If Tom, wants to go on, he goes.\\" Noticing that his toe straps were still undone, Simpson said, \\"Me straps, Harry, me straps!\\" They got him on his bike and pushed him off. Simpson's last words, as remembered by Hall, were, \\"On, on, on.\\" The words, \\"Put me back on my bike!\\" were invented by Sid Saltmarsh, covering the event for The Sun and Cycling ‚Äì now Cycling Weekly ‚Äì who was not there at the time but rather in a reception black-spot for live accounts on Radio Tour. Simpson managed to ride a further before he began to wobble. He was held upright by three spectators who then helped him to the ground on side of the road. Simpson was unconscious with his hands locked to the handlebars. Hall shouted for the other mechanic, Ken Ryall, to pry them loose and the pair laid the lifeless Simpson beside the road. Hall and a nurse from the Tour's medical team took turns giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before Dumas came with an oxygen mask. Approximately forty minutes after his collapse, a police helicopter took Simpson to nearby Avignon Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:40 p.m. Dumas refused to sign a burial certificate and a poisons expert from Marseille was commissioned to conduct an autopsy. Two empty tubes of amphetamines and a half-full tube were found in the rear pocket of his racing jersey, one of which was labelled Tonedron. The British team was called in for questioning and their baggage was searched. Two of the Belgian soigneurs ‚Äì who looked after riders on the British team including Simpson ‚Äì locked themselves in their room, got drunk and did not come out. On the next racing day, the other riders were reluctant to continue racing and asked the organisers for a postponement. French rider Jean Stablinski suggested that the race continue, with a British rider, whose team would wear black armbands, allowed to win the stage. Barry Hoban won the stage. This was later a subject of argument as it was widely believed that the race winner should have been Denson, Simpson's other teammate and close friend. Post-mortem Simpson's burial service took place at the 12th- century All Saints Parish Church, Harworth. Initial media reports suggested that Simpson's death was caused by heat exhaustion, until, on 31 July 1967, British journalist J. L. Manning of the Daily Mail broke the news about a formal connection between drugs and Simpson's death: \\"Tommy Simpson rode to his death in the Tour de France so doped that he did not know he had reached the limit of his endurance. He died in the saddle, slowly asphyxiated by intense effort in a heatwave after taking methylamphetamine drugs and alcoholic stimulants.\\" French authorities confirmed that Simpson had traces of amphetamine in his body, impairing his judgement and allowing him to push his body beyond its limit. The official cause of death was \\"heart failure caused by exhaustion.\\" The live broadcast was the first showing a death caused by doping. His death contributed to the introduction of mandatory testing for performance-enhancing drugs in cycling, leading to tests in 1968 at the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Summer Olympics. Simpson was buried in Harworth Cemetery in Nottinghamshire, after a service at the All Saints Parish Church in the village. An estimated 5,000 mourners attended the ceremony, including Peugeot teammate Eddy Merckx, the only continental rider in attendance. The epitaph on Simpson's gravestone reads, \\"His body ached, his legs grew tired, but still he would not give in,\\" taken from a card left by his brother, Harry, following his death. In his adopted hometown of Ghent, a service was held at Sint-Amandsberg's Catholic Cathedral. Memorials The memorial in Harworth, a replica of the one which stands on the spot where Simpson died. A granite memorial to Simpson stands on the spot where he collapsed and died on Ventoux, one kilometre east of the summit, with the words \\"Olympic medallist, world champion, British sporting ambassador.\\" Cycling opened a subscription fund in the week following his death, raising around ¬£1,500. It was unveiled in 1968 by Simpson's wife Helen, Hoban and the British team manager Alec Taylor. It was inspired by the memorial to motorcycle racer Jimmie Guthrie, who crashed and died at Guthrie's Memorial, Isle of Man, in 1937. Over the years, Simpson's memorial slowly fell into disrepair and a new plinth was constructed, secured into the mountainside with steel rods. On the 30th anniversary of Simpson's death, his daughters Joanne and Jane added a plaque that reads, \\"There is no mountain too high.\\" Concrete steps from the roadside to the memorial were opened on the 40th anniversary. The memorial has become a pilgrimage to cyclists, who pass the memorial and frequently leave tributes such as drinking bottles and caps. In nearby B√©doin, there is a plaque in the square, placed by journalists following the 1967 Tour. The Harworth and Bircotes Sports and Social Club has a small museum dedicated to Simpson, opened by Belgian cyclist Lucien Van Impe in August 2001. The main display includes the bicycle he used to win the 1967 Paris‚ÄìNice and the jersey, gloves and shorts he wore on the day of his death. In 1997, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of his death, a small plaque was added to the Mont Ventoux memorial, with the words \\"There is no mountain too high. Your daughters Jane and Joanne, July 13, 1997\\", and a replica of the memorial was erected outside the museum. In Ghent there is a bust of Simpson at the entrance to the Kuipke velodrome. Every year since his death, the Tom Simpson Memorial Race has taken place in Harworth. British rider David Millar won stage 12 of the 2012 Tour de France on the 45th anniversary of Simpson's death and, having previously been banned from cycling for using performance-enhancing drugs himself, paid tribute to Simpson and reinforced the importance of learning from his ‚Äì and Simpson's ‚Äì mistakes. Millar wrote the introduction for a reissue of Simpson's autobiography, Cycling is My Life, published in 2009.

Its broad area coverage allows for a greater signal range and a lower cost of implementation. Public safety agencies and businesses utilize Private Shared Wireless Networks to send and receive data, communicate, and receive diagnostics information on their fixed equipment, vehicles and/or employees. A Private Shared Wireless Network is built to operate on frequencies that are separate from those of public cellular communications networks and other publicly accessible wireless cellular or radio networks so to avoid their associated network congestion and security vulnerabilities. Background Since 9/11, when data interoperability between first responders radio communications and interference issues with public networks led to loss of life, the US federal government has expressed a need for an interoperable communications networks for first responders. One of the U.S. government's attempts at creating a private shared wireless network occurred in 2008, with FCC Spectrum Auction 73. The radio spectrum being sold was divided into five blocks, A, B, C, D and E. It was the D block that held special conditions placed upon the winner; mainly that whoever purchased this spectrum would be required to build out a next generation network that will also support public safety broadband services. The only bid on this block of spectrum did not meet the minimum reserve price, and thus the shared network was never realized. As a result, many telecommunications equipment providers have begun building their own private shared networks, and selling various services and applications to businesses, such as AVL/GPS, asset tracking via RFID & barcode scanning, and 2-way messaging. Composition and function A Private Shared Wireless Network is made up of multiple communications towers and base stations, each at a fixed location, spread about a given geographic area for ubiquitous coverage. The data exchange generally occurs between a company's assets via a vehicle mounted mobile data terminal, or via an RFID, and a central dispatching logistics center. This allows the dispatcher the ability to monitor and correct the performance of these assets remotely. Private Shared Wireless Networks are generally engineered for data-only communications networks. This allows for a greater number of users on the network and more reliable communications, as data makes much more efficient use of wireless spectrum than does voice. Many regional and municipal governments have begun to create and engineer their own private networks over multiple tower infrastructures. Companies such as Cisco Systems have invested in Private Shared Wireless Networks as part of their strategic planning. Private Shared Wireless Networks are an evolving solution addressing the communication and data requirements of government at the national, regional and municipal level, as well as utility companies, transportation companies and businesses which require a private solution operating via an established tower based network. US government mandates have fueled a need for first responders to operate in an interoperable manner. A Private Shared Wireless Network is a network available to businesses who seek an alternative from those hosted by cellular companies.

Bernini first discussed the project while in France in the mid-1660s, but it did not start until later in the decade, when back in Rome. It was not completed until 1684 and then shipped to Paris in 1685. Louis XIV of France was extremely unhappy with the end result and had it placed in a corner of the gardens of the royal palace at Versailles. Soon after, the sculpture was modified by Fran√ßois Girardon and altered into an equestrian sculpture of the ancient Roman hero Marcus Curtius.Wittkower 1955, p. 293.  History  = Invitation = For much of the 17th century, Bernini was regarded as the premier artist of the era, serving as the primary source of artistic works commissioned by Pope Urban VIII. As a result, Louis XIV invited him to come to France to work in the name of the French monarchy. Bernini accepted this invitation, traveling to Paris to construct an equestrian statue and a portrait bust, as well as a new fa√ßade of the Louvre. = Bernini in France = The day after his arrival in Paris on June 3, 1665, Bernini concluded that the work that had been already done on the Louvre by Louis Le Vau, a French Classical Baroque architect who had been hired by Louis XIV, was inadequate, deciding instead to create his own designs, citing his own observations of palaces throughout his career. Bernini would eventually propose to abandon Le Vau‚Äôs ongoing project, instead insisting that he would provide the design details himself. Bernini's first concept for the planned east fa√ßade, which placed a heavy emphasis on curved wings in the Italian style, was almost immediately rejected. Jean-Baptiste Colbert also stated that Bernini's plans to place the king's own room in the outwardly protruding central pavilion would be a noisy location due to its close proximity to the nearby street and foot traffic. Following the rejection of the first draft, Bernini sent in a second draft which too was rejected by Colbert, though unlike the first and the third drafts an image does not appear to have survived. The third and final draft, which had eliminated the curved wings that Bernini initially envisioned, was praised by Louis, who had held a formal ceremony to lay the cornerstone of the new facade. However, as soon as Bernini left France to return to Rome, Louis ordered the construction to stop. = Construction and creation = Bernini followed French tradition creating equestrian statues of French kings in their own residences, with notable examples by Francois Mansart, Charles Perrault, and Pierre Cottard. Despite tradition, Bernini was the first in France to design an equestrian statue to be freestanding with a rearing horse rather than attached to building. The precedent for this was Pietro Tacca's sculpture of Philip IV in the garden of Buen Retiro (1642) in Madrid which had been considered to be the first equestrian monument displaying a rearing rider since antiquity. This emulation reflected the Franco-Spanish rivalry during the reign of King Louis XIV. In many images that capture the likeness of Louis XIV, the principal component was the metaphor of Louis‚Äô reign, the sun, which conforms to the tradition of the oriens augusti, or ‚Äúthe rising of the august one‚Äù, a term that identifies a ruler with the sun. The sun was also one of many symbols for Pope Urban VIII, Bernini‚Äôs greatest patron. In his time serving Urban VIII, Bernini was involved in the design of a frescoed vault within the Barberini Palace in Rome in which Divine Wisdom appears with the symbol of the sun on her breast. = Transportation and arrival in France = In the fall of 1684, the statue was shipped from Civitavecchia, Italy by boat. In March of 1685, the Statue arrived in Paris. The statue was then shipped to Versailles during August and September, arriving at the palace on October 1st, 1685. By the ninth, the statue was placed in the orangerie, in one of the galleries there. = Reception = On the 14th of November 1685, Louis XIV saw the statue for the first time in the orangerie, Marquis de Dangeau recorded that the king had resolved to remove the statue from the grounds and to destroy it. The statue, however, was not destroyed, but moved to another location on the main axis of the Orangerie, south of the pool. In September of 1686, Bernini‚Äôs statue was displaced by Domenico Guidi‚Äôs La Renommee de Louis XIV. The statue was moved to a location on the far side of the newly constructed Neptune Basin, the most northern point on the north-south axis of the Garden. It was placed on a high pedestal. This location was not one of obscurity, but of prominence. In 1702, after the transformation from Louis XIV to Marcus Curtius, the Roman hero, the statue was moved to the end of the Lake of the Swiss Guards. The Statue was positioned near the pool, which symbolizes the abyss that Marcus Curtius throws himself into. Rather than being immediately rejected, the statue was placed in several areas of prominence over a 16-year period, before finally being placed on the far side of The Lake of the Swiss Guard at the opposite end of the palace grounds from the Basin of Neptune. Orangerie at Versailles with the Lake of the Swiss Guards. Bernini's sculpture was placed at the very far end of the lake. Upon viewing the completed equestrian statue, Louis XIV had declared it to be an abomination and ordered it to be destroyed; however, he was later convinced by his courtiers to have it moved to a remote location within the palace grounds. As a result, it was placed at the end of the Lake of the Swiss Guards, completely separating the statue and the main palace grounds. In spite of Louis's public rejection of the equestrian statue, its form inspired future royal portraits of the king, including a marble creation by Antoine Coysevox depicting Louis XIV on horseback which sits in the Salon of War at Versailles, making corrections to facial characteristics created by Bernini which the French king interpreted as a slight against him, creating a more somber expression and raising the forehead to a more 'suitable' height. = After Bernini's visit = Following the failure of Bernini's stay in Paris, French attitudes toward Italian culture changed, a shift in attitude that for the first time since the Renaissance recognized that a national self- consciousness and self confidence north of the Alps had developed, an attitude that developed as a result of the rejection of the Italian Baroque and the popularization of French classicism, resulting in Bernini's redesign of the Louvre never rising above its foundations.  Culmination of themes in Bernini's work  = The Vision of Constantine = Gianlorenzo bernini, costantino, 1670, 02 In his process to construct the equestrian statue, Bernini referred back to one of his earlier works, the Vision of the Emperor Constantine, which began construction in 1654 and was completed in late 1669. The equestrian statue of Louis XIV was designed with his earlier work on the equestrian monument of the emperor Constantine in Rome in mind, with both horses striking similar poses and neither riders holding reins or stirrups. Whereas Constantine's gestures were raised above him to convey the vision of the Holy Cross and God above him, the Sun King‚Äôs gestures are grounded to convey his mundane and non-divine power in an act that Bernini termed as an ‚Äòact of majesty and command'. Unlike the statue of Constantine, the statue of Louis XIV had been carved from a single block of stone, to be 'the largest ever seen in Rome,\\" according to early biographers. = Bust of Louis XIV = Ch√¢teau de Versailles, salon de Diane, buste de Louis XIV, Bernin (1665) 03 In addition to the equestrian statue, Louis XIV commissioned Bernini to sculpt a portrait bust of himself. The bust was modeled on another Bernini had made ten years prior of Francesco d‚ÄôEste, the Duke of Modena. Both include many similar features, including the lance jabot, the shoulder clad in armor, and a cloak that appears to be floating in the wind. The most notable similarity between the two busts is the use of drapery to 'conceal' the lower torso. Both of these busts, along with the Louis XIV equestrian statue are examples of the ways in which Bernini depicts power in the context of seventeenth-century absolute monarchies. A detail of Louis‚Äôs bust comes from an anecdote recorded by Domenico Bernini and was summarized by the historian Cecil Gould, > ‚ÄúOne of the visitors at this early stage [July 22] was the Marquis de > Bellefonds, who said he would have liked to see some hair on the King‚Äôs > forehead‚Ä¶ Bernini‚Äôs comment on this occasion was that painters had the > advantage over sculptors in being able‚Ä¶ to depict hair on a forehead without > obscuring it. This thought fired Bernini to attempt the impossible. A week > after Bellefonds‚Äô visit Chantelou noticed that Bernini had in fact added a > lock of hair onto the forehead of the bust‚Ä¶ The addition of this lock, of > which Bernini was very proud, could only be achieved by cutting back all the > upper part of the forehead except for the curl itself. This was later to be > criticized adversely, and it did in fact falsify the shape of the King‚Äôs > forehead.‚Äù The anecdote points out that Bernini was more concerned with the technical side of the bust rather than carving with accuracy to the king‚Äôs likeness. The alteration resulted in a change in brow shape that was considered to be ‚Äòunflattering‚Äô.  Later changes  = Recutting = In 1687, Francois Girardon was tasked with amending Berini's sculpture. When recut by Girardon the equestrian statue was re-purposed to depict Marcus Curtius, an ancient Roman hero. In his story, an abyss appeared in the middle of the Roman forum that only the sacrifice of Rome's greatest possession would close. As a result Curtius determined that Rome's most prized possession with the bravery of its soldiers and hurled himself into the abyss while riding his horse, closing it. Girardon, the director of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, and the governor of all royal commissions of sculpture, carved the head and the horse‚Äôs support, adding a helmet and flames while changing the face. This narrative was viewed as better fitting the contortions of the horse, which did not depict a high level of horsemanship. Bernini had opted for movement instead of poise which was not well received by Louis XIV Two major elements were changed; the flowing hair at the back of Louis XIV‚Äôs head was converted into the casque of a crested helmet and the flags were converted into a mass of flames at the horse‚Äôs feet.

It aired on September 22, 2011. The episode was written by Kevin Williamson & Andrew Miller. It was directed by Liz Friedlander. Plot Cassie (Britt Robertson) finds her mom's Book Of Shadows hidden in her room along with a letter from her mother. Reading it, she knows now that the other kids were telling the truth about magic and them being witches. After that, she attempts to distance herself from them because she does not want to be part of the Circle or practice magic. She does not tell them that she found her mom's book either. Dawn (Natasha Henstridge) gets a surprise when her father-in-law, Henry (Tom Butler), appears at her front door. She wonders if Henry has learned something about her plans with Charles (Gale Harold) and she calls him to make sure that he did not do anything so Henry would find out. Later, we see that Ethan (Adam J. Harrington) was the one who called Henry after what happened between him and Charles, telling him that somehow Charles has his powers back or he found a way to use magic again. Henry asks Dawn directly about Charles but she denies everything saying that something like that is impossible. When he asks her about the kids and if they are practicing, she pretends to be surprised. Diana (Shelley Hennig) insists that they have to bind the Circle so they can control their powers and she and Adam are trying to convince Cassie to work with them. Faye, on the other hand, (Phoebe Tonkin) does not want that since she enjoys the increase of her power and she is using it on any occasion just to have fun. Once though things get out of control and she pushes Sally (Logan Browning) over the deck. Dawn, not having another choice, uses the crystal to save Sally so no one, especially Faye, gets into trouble. Henry, who is there, sees that Dawn has a crystal in her possession and he asks her to give it to him. When he says that he will let the elders know what is going on, Dawn kills him. After what happened at the deck, those from the Circle do not want something like that to happen again and they agree with Diana that they have to bind their Circle so they can control their powers.

He was the grandson of Sir Francis Slingsby of Scriven, and thus a first cousin of Sir Henry Slingsby, 1st Baronet. His eldest brother Guildford Slingsby was a promising young politician and lawyer who was killed early in the English Civil War. Early career He entered the Navy as a boy and when he was only 22 was given his first command, the Eighth Lyon's Whelp; in 1636 he commanded the Third Lyon's Whelp, and then the Expedition, in which he transported arms from the Tower of London to Edinburgh in 1640. He then commanded a small squadron in the English Channel, and in 1642 he escorted the Portuguese Ambassador to Lisbon in the Garland. On the outbreak of the Civil War he declared for Charles I, but his men mutinied and he was imprisoned. On his release he joined the King at Oxford and in 1644 went to the Continent to raise funds for the Royalist cause. He returned to England: he and his brother Walter were with Prince Rupert when he surrendered Bristol, then they went to Brussels to join their brother Arthur, who in 1658 was created first of the Slingsby baronets of Bifrons. Robert later returned to England alone, and in 1650, like so many defeated Royalists, he compounded i.e. paid a fine in return for being left with sufficient means to live on. According to his sister Dorothy Nightingale, he was then living with their widowed mother at York.Clay, John William editor Yorkshire Royalist Composition Papers Vol. 3 Cambridge University Press 2013 reprint p.23 Robert was then described as being \\"infirm and wounded, and not likely to live long\\".Clay p.24 Restoration  At the Restoration he was given his father's old office of Comptroller of the Navy, and was created the first and last of the Slingsby baronets of Newcells. He had already presented the King with his book \\"The Past and Present State of His Majesty's Navy\\" which argued for regular payment of sailors' wages, prohibition of private trading in goods by Naval officers and the encouragement of merchant shipping. Samuel Pepys praised the great efforts Slingsby had taken over the book, but added drily that he had too high an opinion of his own work. Despite such occasional jibes, a warm friendship sprung up between Slingsby and Pepys: Slingsby invited Pepys regularly to his house, read him his verses, and drew on his own experience of the Navy in Charles I's time to explain how Pepys' own office, Clerk of the Acts, had been performed then. Bryant remarks that Pepys respected Slingsby as he could never respect other colleagues like Sir William Batten.Bryant, Arthur Samuel Pepys- the Man in the Making Reprint Society Edition 1952 p.144 Death Slingsby did not enjoy office for long: on 22 October 1661 Pepys noted that he was sick of ague and fever (an intermittent fever which killed several thousand people in London in 1661‚Äì4),Diary of Samuel Pepys 22 October 1661 and on 24 October he 'continued ill, which makes them all afeared for him'.Pepys' Diary 24 October 1661 He died on 26 October to Pepys' grief: 'he being a man that had loved me and had many qualities that made me love him above all the officers and Commissioners in the Navy'.Pepys' Diary 26 October 1661 Pepys was distressed that there was no memorial service, which he regarded as a deliberate slight on Slingsby's memory from other colleagues like Batten and Sir William Penn, who in Pepys' opinion had regarded Slinsgby's integrity as a check on their greed and ambition. Both Batten and Penn professed grief at Slingsby' death, but Pepys regarded them as a pair of hypocrites.Pepys' Diary 30 October 1661 Marriage  Dilston Castle, the family home of Slingsby's second wife, Elizabeth Radclyffe He married firstly Elizabeth Brooke, only daughter and heiress of Robert Brooke of Newcells, Hertfordshire and Joan Prannell. He married secondly Elizabeth Radclyffe, daughter of Sir Edward Radclyffe of Dilston Castle, Northumberland and Elizabeth Barton, and widow of Sir Walter Fenwick. Pepys praised Slingsby's second wife as a \\"good woman\\".Pepys' Diary 15 April 1661 He had no son and his title died with him; according to Pepys he had at least one daughter, of whom little seems to be known.Pepys' Diary 2 January 1661 References Category:Lords of the Admiralty Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of England Category:1611 births Category:1661 deaths Category:People from Canterbury Category:English sailors Category:17th-century Royal Navy personnel ","title":"Sir Robert Slingsby, 1st Baronet"},{"id":"39852543","text":"Newport shown within Wales In the United Kingdom, the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical, or cultural significance; Grade II* structures are those considered to be \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\".

It was designed by Ian Walters and completed, following his death, by Aleix Barbat. It was inspired by a poem written by local resident Cecile Nobrega and honors women of the Caribbean community. It was unveiled in October 2008.Women in the Caribbean are women who were born in, who live in, or are from the region of the Caribbean in the Americas. Historically, Caribbean women have been significant contributors to the economy and the \\"domestic sphere\\" of the Caribbean region since the time of slavery, during the time of \\"free labor forces\\" in the late 19th and 20th centuries, as well as during the time of \\"contemporary politics\\" and economics. Their position and status may vary \\"among Caribbean societies\\", cultural groups, and geographical locations, that have different language backgrounds which include English-, Spanish-, and French-speaking communities in the West Indies.Morrissey, Marietta. A Review of Women and Change in the Caribbean, a work edited by Janet H. Momsen. Kingston: Ian Randle; Bloomington: Indiana University Press; London: Currey, 1993. x, 320 pp. Women in The Caribbean Project (WICP) is a project that identifies personalized social realities that women are challenged with. The main focus is to analyze how these realities came to be and the consequences they have on the individual and community as social change occur (Massiah, 1986).  Sex-role and Self-perception  Women in the Caribbean's role as child-bearer and nurture extended to the dual role. Women's role has resulted in the addition of instrumental tasks. Women were obligated to maintain the duties of the household due to the increase in male emigration towards the end of the century of slavery (Anderson 1986). Because of WWII, the economy had an unexpected change. During this time there was a need for more workers, specifically one who acquired a higher education. This resulted in an increase in female workers and the structure of class started making its way through the cohort gender. Women seek work outside of the household, but their obligation at home was still the main priority. It is still a women's responsibility to ensure that their husband and children are well established before work outside is done. A woman having a child sensed to be one's source of identity. Having children gives a woman a feeling of fulfillment. To bear and raise children fills the emotional gap. When one is not able to bear a child, she will assist other parenting mothers. Once a mother, she is considered to be to some degree independent and responsible. Before World War II the correlation of having children and being thought highly begins in their own families. It Is then strengthen by outside experiences such as school systems. The school systems were based on the idea that women are the intellectual antithesis to men. As women seek work their value in the labor market decreases. The male role includes authority and power due to the fact of being an economic provider. Even though males have this status, by Caribbean women actively being the decision-maker when it comes to familial roles and their income earned outside of the home, these women attribute to leadership. When male figures are absent, women are responsible for taking the full role of the household; including the roles assigned to the man.  Haitian women in the Caribbean  The class structure in Haiti is divided into distinct castes rather than classes. The kinship system and its values differentiate depending on social class (Allman & Allman 1987). The urban, educated, French-speakers differ from the rural and newly arrived migrants living in Port-au-Prince. Family patterns differ between urban and rural areas. In rural areas, the patterns of families are related to lacou; meaning courtyard. Large groups of kins living together around a central court. Each extended family would live in their caille, but the compound was connected through communal working and under the authority of a patriarch. This system was the main structure until the 20th century. This was created when the socio-economic system was broken up after independence of 1804 and plantations were given to peasants. In urban areas, the families are of a small minority of upper-class Haitians. The middle and lower-middle-class Haitians have family patterns of French orientation. Haitian women play a large role in the economy. They are often running households without the help of a father. Many live alone without a husband with their children and other relatives. Peasant women are responsible for selling the produce of the land. They also buy items in urban areas for families. The women are constantly traveling to markets, at times the distances are far. and petty retailing. Urban Haitian women are workers in assembly factories. The economic responsibility gives high independence and sometimes can lead to them to be of equal power to the working men. Haitian women's status is higher in rural areas within the lower urban classes; whereas status is lower in the middle classes. In the Haitian society, men and women are relatively equal when it comes to earning money, economic activities and household duties. Haitian women are able to support and care for their children for a long period of time with very little help form men.

Many of these have become viral videos; the 2006 video for \\"Here It Goes Again\\", in which the band performed a complex routine with the aid of motorized treadmills, has received over 50 million views four years later. Their video for Needing/Getting, released February 5, 2012 in partnership with Chevrolet, debuted during Super Bowl XLVI and has over 32 million views on YouTube. Samuel Bayer, who produced many music videos in the 1990s, asserted that OK Go's promotion of music videos on the Internet was akin to Nirvana's ushering in the grunge movement. Many of the videos also use long or single-shot takes, which Salons Matt Zoller Seitz says \\"restore[s] a sense of wonder to the musical number by letting the performers' humanity shine through and allowing them to do their thing with a minimum of filmmaking interference\\". The success of OK Go's music first won the band the 14th Annual Webby Special Achievement Award for Film and Video Artist of the Year. The video for \\"This Too Shall Pass\\" was named both \\"Video of the Year\\" and \\"Best Rock Video\\" at the 3rd annual UK Music Video Awards.\\"This Too Shall Pass\\" won the LA Film Fest's Audience Award for Best Music Video, UK MVA Awards ‚Äì Music Video of the Year Winner 2010, among others. The band has worked with directors including Francis Lawrence, Olivier Gondry (brother of Michel Gondry), Brian L. Perkins, Scott Keiner, and Todd Sullivan. The videos have been screened and displayed at museums, art galleries, and film festivals around the world including The Guggenheim Museum, The Museum of the Moving Image, The Edinburgh International Film Festival, The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Los Angeles Film Festival, and the Saatchi & Saatchi New Director's Showcase. In 2008, Damian Kulash said that the band had not produced the YouTube videos as part of any overt \\"Machiavellian\\" marketing campaign. \\"In neither case did we think, 'A-ha, this will get people to buy our records.' It has always been our position that the reason you wind up in a rock band is you want to make stuff. You want to do creative things for a living.\\" Style OK Go's distinctive, choreography-heavy performance style first originated from a 1999 appearance on the Chicago-based public television show \\"Chic-a-GoGo\\"; WBEZ radio personalities Peter Sagal, Jerome McDonnell of Worldview, Gretchen Helfrich (formerly of Odyssey) and Ira Glass pretended to play instruments to \\"C-C-C-Cinnamon Lips\\" as OK Go danced, because the band wasn't allowed to play live on the show. On August 31, 2006, OK Go appeared live at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards performing their treadmill routine for \\"Here It Goes Again\\". On November 7, 2006, OK Go released a deluxe limited edition CD/DVD of the album Oh No. The DVD contains their music videos (dancing and playing instruments), a video of 180 fans performing the \\"A Million Ways\\" dance for a YouTube contest, previously unseen footage, and a behind-the-scenes look at their treadmill rehearsals for the \\"Here It Goes Again\\" video and for the MTV VMAs.

It is a single-shot music video filmed on a green screen. The band used an open-source programming language and integrated development environment called Processing to stack each frame filmed on top of the one before it, creating a psychedelic effect. \\"This Too Shall Pass\\" Official Video (Marching Band) *Released January 8, 2010 featuring the University of Notre Dame's Band of the Fighting Irish. *Directed by Brian L. Perkins and OK Go. * 11 million YouTube views *OK Go's first video for \\"This Too Shall Pass\\" is a single-shot music video collaboration with 125 members of the University of Notre Dame's marching band and 50 students from Perley Elementary and Good Shepherd Montessori School in South Bend, Indiana. The video took 20 takes to complete correctly. The band contacted Notre Dame after seeing a YouTube clip of the marching band performing Here It Goes Again at a football game. \\"This Too Shall Pass\\" Rube Goldberg Machine *Released March 1, 2010 in partnership with State Farm Insurance. *Directed by James Frost, OK Go, and Syyn Labs. * 58 million YouTube views *OK Go's second video for \\"This Too Shall Pass\\" is a music video of the band performing within an elaborate Rube Goldberg Machine built in a warehouse in the Echo Park area of Los Angeles. The video appears to be a single shot video, but the video actually shows 3 different takes (evidenced by members of the band appearing splattered in paint from previous takes). Production began in November 2009 and continued through two days of filming on February 11 & 12, 2010 with a total crew of 60 builders and production staff. The machine, which rolls metal balls down tracks, swings sledgehammers, pours water, unfurls flags, drops a flock of umbrellas from the second story, and shoots paint cannons at the band, was precisely designed to be synchronized with the song. The video took about 60 takes to be completed correctly, with one hour and a staff of 30 required to reset the machine between takes. This video was the 7th most-watched video of 2010, and as such was featured on the 2010 YouTube Rewind. \\"End Love\\" *Released July 14, 2010. *Directed by OK Go, Eric Gunther, and Jeff Lieberman. * 24 million YouTube views *\\"End Love\\" is a stop motion dance video filmed in one continuous 18-hour take and sped up in post-production. The video's choreography included OK Go sleeping overnight in the park where the video was filmed as cameras continued to roll. The band announced an open call for fans to participate in the video and a group of fan volunteers is featured at the end of the video. The video contains a range of frame-rate speeds, from one frame per second stop motion to super slow motion at 30 times the normal speed. During filming, a goose living in the park followed the band, and consequently shows up throughout the video. He was nicknamed \\"Orange Bill\\" by band members. \\"White Knuckles\\" *Released September 20, 2010. *Directed by Trish Sie and OK Go. * 23 million YouTube views *\\"White Knuckles\\" is a single-shot music video featuring OK Go dancing with 12 dogs (including lead singer Damian Kulash's dog Bunny Carlos.) The video is a collaboration with animal trainers Lauren Henry and Ronald Sonnenburg in association with Talented Animals. Despite the difficulty of shooting a single-shot video with animals (\\"For those of you who have never worked an animal on film, we use cuts and optimal camera angles for everything,\\" Sonnenburg wrote on the Talented Animals blog) the band traveled to Oregon with 12 trainers, 12 dogs, one goat, two furniture movers, and the rest of the production team for four weeks of training, choreography, rehearsal, and filming. 124 takes were shot over three days of filming and take #72 became the final video. The video premiered on The Ellen Degeneres Show on September 20, 2010, and was performed by the band on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno later that night. The video was released in 3D on the Nintendo 3DS on April 10, 2013. The video also promotes animal rescue efforts, ending with the message: \\"These dogs were lucky to find loving homes, but many others are still waiting. Help us support animal rescue efforts at the ASPCA.\\" The band announced that all proceeds from video sales would be donated to animal rescue efforts. \\"Last Leaf\\" *Released November 10, 2010 in partnership with Samsung NX100 iFn. *Directed by OK Go, Nadeem Mazen, and Ali Mohammad.Our Story  danger!awesome * 4 million YouTube views *\\"Last Leaf\\" is a stop motion animation video created using 2,430 pieces of toast laser-cut with designs by the band and artist Geoff Mcfetridge. Shot on a Samsung NX100 iFn camera, the video used 15 photos for every second of animation. \\"Back From Kathmandu\\" *Released December 12, 2010 in partnership with Range Rover. *Directed by OK Go. * 900,000 YouTube views *In \\"Back From Kathmandu\\", OK Go led fans in a five-mile, 8-hour musical parade through the streets of Los Angeles. The video's concept was based on large- scale parades in New Orleans where large informal groups gather with instruments and march around the city. Guided by Range Rover's Pulse Of The City app, which lets users visualize journeys by using GPS technology, the parade's route created a giant geo-art OK GO sign on the city's streets. \\"All Is Not Lost\\" *Released July 25, 2011 in partnership with Google Chrome Japan and featuring Pilobolus. *Directed by OK Go, Pilobolus, and Trish Sie. * 2.6 million YouTube views *All Is Not Lost is an HTML-5 enabled multi- window web application, which combines elaborate high-concept choreography with technology, to create a hybrid human-technology dance. In the video, dancers are shot from below performing on a clear plexiglass surface while wearing green unitards. During the course of the video, the dance is split into progressively more HTML5 windows, further expanding the number of possible interactions and movements for the dancers. The production team shot 12 separate films, all one continuous take. At the end, the video splits into 48 separate windows to spell out custom messages entered by users in English or Japanese. On July 27, 2011, the band launched a 3D version of the video on the Nintendo 3DS platform, which allows the viewing of 3D videos without the need for special glasses. The 3D version was created by filmmaker Eric Kurland, and is notable because the third dimension appears behind the screen instead of 'popping out' in front of it. \\"Needing/Getting\\" *Released February 5, 2012 in partnership with Chevrolet. *Directed by Brian L.

The video was shot over four days after four months of preparation and design that included lead singer Damian Kulash taking stunt driving lessons. The video premiered on February 5, 2012 during the Super Bowl XLVI pregame show and was shown again during the game as part of Chevrolet's \\"Stunt Anthem\\" spot, which also featured the band fun. and skateboarder Rob Dyrdek. \\"Skyscrapers\\" *Released March 29, 2012. *Directed by Trish Sie. * 5 million YouTube views *In the video, director Trish Sie dances the tango across a brightly colored landscape with partner Moti Buchboot.

It is a one-shot take where the camera is moved by the band through a warehouse setup with a number of stations consisting of common objects, clothes worn by the band, and painted surfaces, as to create optical illusions when the camera is in the correct position. \\"I Won't Let You Down\\" *Released October 27, 2014 *Directed by Damian Kulash, Jr., Kazuaki Seki * 41 million views on YouTube *A one-shot video with the band and over 2,300 dancers, many performing on personal mobility devices, performing elaborate routines while filmed by a drone-mounted camera to move between ground-level and bird's-eye view shots. The device that the group and a large number of dancers ride on is the Honda UNI-CUB. The video was filmed on a camera mounted to an octocopter drone.

Like The Beach Boys Love You, it is virtually a Brian Wilson solo project with other group members serving mainly as additional vocalists. After it was rejected by Reprise Records, the band released the 1978 M.I.U. Album in its place with an almost entirely revamped song list. A few projected tracks for Adult Child were eventually released on later albums and compilations. Currently, the album is available only as a bootleg recording. Stylus Magazine tersely summarizes the work: \\"Brian‚Äôs Sinatra album. Vegas big band arrangements, brassy cover tunes, a few songs written with the hopes that the Chairman himself might sing them. The label heard it and probably rejected it before track 2 began.\\" Amid its status as an esoteric non-release within the Beach Boys catalog, the album has developed a mild cult following among fans and musicians. Background The Beach Boys performing a concert in 1978 In 1977, plans were made for a Beach Boys album composed entirely of outtakes recorded during 1976 sessions for 15 Big Ones (1976) and The Beach Boys Love You (1977) partnered with material originating as far back as 1965. After the release of Love You, the Beach Boys fell into dispute over the direction of the band, and were close to breaking up. Intended as a follow-up to Love You, sessions and mixing for a new album entitled Adult Child were completed by the Beach Boys with Brian Wilson acting as producer. Similarly with \\"Good Time\\" on The Beach Boys Love You, a few Adult Child tracks were outtakes sourced from earlier Beach Boys albums. Sessions for the album were kickstarted on January 19, 1977, only five days after the assembly for Love You was completed. Concurrently, Dennis Wilson worked on his solo album Pacific Ocean Blue which would see release in September of 1977. According to Stan Love, the band's manager and younger brother of the Beach Boys' Mike Love, when Mike heard the rough demo recordings of Adult/Child replete with big band swing arrangements, he turned to Brian and asked: \\"What the fuck are you doing?\\" While projected for release in autumn 1977, the album was rejected by Reprise Records for not being commercially viable. Music and lyrics Brian composes, writes, and sings most of Adult/Child with Carl and Dennis Wilson swapping lead vocals. Exceptionally, Brian included the group's cover versions of \\"Deep Purple\\", \\"On Broadway\\", and the traditional folk standard \\"Shortenin' Bread\\", the last of which he had been obsessed with for several years. Dick Reynolds was commissioned for the arrangement of four tracks. Reynolds had arranged strings for The Beach Boys' Christmas Album, and for Brian's idols the Four Freshmen and Frank Sinatra in 1964. The album's lyrics mostly reflect the minutiae of Brian's life during the 1970s. Some songs center around physical fitness, eating healthy, and ecology. Describing \\"Hey Little Tomboy\\", a leftover from Love You, Brian said, \\"It's about a little girl who is sort of a rough neck, and this guy convinces her to become a pretty girl, and sure enough she slowly turns into a pretty‚Äîshe starts shaving her legs and wearing short sticks‚Äîputs lipstick on and makeup. So she's a little tomboy. ... We're very happy with it.\\" Biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote that \\"[the song] reveled uncomfortably in an adolescent girl who is putting away her skateboard and baseball mitt in order to get hot and heavy with the swain portrayed by Mike. ... [it] may be the most unsettling moment in the entire recorded history of the Beach Boys.\\" In line with the group's two previous albums, it was also slated to include a couple of Sunflower-era leftovers in \\"H.E.L.P. Is on the Way\\" and \\"Games Two Can Play.\\" Availability The album has been released through numerous bootlegs, but is officially unavailable. \\"Hey Little Tomboy\\" appears in a slightly revised form on M.I.U. Album. \\"Shortenin' Bread\\", a traditional folk song with which Brian was reportedly obsessed at the time, was revised and placed on L.A. (Light Album) (1979). \\"H.E.L.P. Is on the Way,\\" \\"Games Two Can Play,\\" \\"It's Over Now,\\" and \\"Still I Dream of It\\" were released on the group's box set Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys (1993). An alternate piano demo of \\"Still I Dream of It\\" was included on Brian Wilson's solo album I Just Wasn't Made for These Times (1995). Reception Musicologist Philip Lambert believes, \\"All of the songs from this collection are solid efforts, but 'Still I Dream of It' and 'It's Over Now' are particularly inspired and rank right up there with Brian's best work,\\" calling them \\"gut-wrenching ballads about romance and heartbreak.\\" Scram‚Äîa fanzine devoted to esoteric works‚Äîsaid: \\"There are so-called Beach Boys fans who say anybody who applaud Love You and this album is being ironic. I say fuck those tight-arsed naysayers! Both of those albums showcase a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliche, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before.\\" Stylus Magazine included the album in a list entitled \\"'Long Time Gone' ‚Äì The Classic Rock Lost Album Archetypes\\" among other Beach Boys' non-releases such as Smile, Landlocked, and Bambu as a \\"A Lost Album Category Unto Themselves\\". The journal wrote: In 2000, a cover of \\"Lines\\" was recorded by Duglas T. Stewart of indie pop band BMX Bandits for the various artists tribute album Caroline Now!. BMX Bandits recorded a version of \\"Hey Little Tomboy\\" with Pearlfishers. \\"Still I Dream of It\\" has been covered by Ed Harcourt, Jimmy Nail, and Carice van Houten. \\"Life Is for the Living\\" was recorded and released by the Easy Goings in 1992, and performed live in 2015 by Neil Hamburger at Festival Supreme. Track listing Adult Child was mixed and assembled in the following sequence on June 27, 1977, but it is reported that \\"Shortenin' Bread\\" and \\"It's Over Now\\" may have been dropped five days later: \\"It's Trying to Say\\" is also known as \\"Baseball's On\\".

Early life  Olkhovsky was born June 22, 1930 in Ukraine. A survivor of Stalin‚Äôs Soviet Union and Hitler‚Äôs Germany, he immigrated with his parents to the United States in 1949, becoming an American citizen in 1953. The family settled in Utica, N.Y. Dr. Olkhovsky's father went to work making T-shirts in a clothing factory and his mother found work in a laundry. Dr. Olkhovsky, known as George by his friends and colleagues, became a farmworker picking strawberries. He served in the US Army‚Äôs 101st Airborne Division during the Korean War at Camp Breckinridge and Ft. Knox, Kentucky, becoming the division‚Äôs senior linguist. By 1959, Dr. Olkhovsky earned a BA and an MA in history from the University of Minnesota. In 1968 he completed his PhD in Russian History at Georgetown University.  Career  Dr. Olkhovsky came to the Washington, DC area in 1957 and worked as a Russian language instructor at the National Security Agency. From the mid-1960s until after the breakup of the Soviet Union, he continued to develop and teach Russian language and culture courses part-time to NSA staff. In 1962, Dr. Olkhovsky became a full-time faculty member at GWU where he worked until retiring in 1998. His positions included several terms as Chairman of GWU‚Äôs Department of Slavic Languages and Literature. During the 1970s and 80s, Dr. Olkhovsky worked avidly in support of prominent Soviet dissidents working with various administrations and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. He worked with well-known Soviet dissidents who came to the West including Vladimir Bukovsky, Andrei Amalrik, General Petro Grigorenko and Vladimir Maximov. Dr. Olkhovsky's efforts included assisting in the editing, publication and distribution of the dissident journal Kontinent published in the West. In the late 1970s he served as Kontinent's US correspondent and representative. He worked on human rights causes that included maintaining a friendship and collaboration with famed cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich for over two decades. From 1964 until 1983, Dr. Olkhovsky also worked part time as a broadcaster and writer for the Voice of America Russian Service. In 1983, he took a two-year leave from GWU to be Deputy Director of Radio Liberty in Munich, a US government-funded Radio station established during the Cold War to broadcast to audiences in the Soviet Union. According to his Washington Post obituary, \\"When Nobel Prize-winning Russian writer Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn was exiled to the West in 1974, he told reporters that he had been amazed at the amount of straight news on Voice of America. The broadcaster he often heard was Dr. Olkhovsky.\\" Dr. Olkhovsky's book \\"Vladimir Stasov and Russian National Culture\\" (1983) was about a Russian author and cultural critic who wrote extensively on the development of Russian music in the 19th century. In 1941, the invading German army destroyed an about-to-be-published book that Dr. Olkhovsky's father, Andrey Vasilyevich Olkhovsky, had written. In 2003, Dr. Olkhovsky was able to fulfill a promise to his father by editing and updating the manuscript and publishing the book, a comprehensive survey of Ukrainian music. Andrey Vasilyevich Olkhovsky was known in academic musicology circles for his 1955 book \\"Music Under the Soviets: The Agony of an Art.\\" .

From left Jo Swinson MP (Liberal Democrats), Jackson Carlaw MSP (Conservative Party), Dr Azeem Ibrahim, Alistair Darling MP (Labour Party) and Jim Mather MSP (Scottish National Party) The Scotland Institute is a think tank operating in Scotland which describes itself as \\"progressive and independent\\". It was founded and entirely funded by Dr Azeem Ibrahim, a Glasgow-born expert in strategic policy development, and formally launched in June 2012 by leading politicians Alistair Darling, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Liberal Democrat MP Jo Swinson, SNP Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism Jim Mather MSP and Scottish Conservative Jackson Carlaw. The institute examined questions around Scottish independence from a neutral, academic perspective and produced a number of policy reports, including well-referenced reports on defence provision, poverty and social exclusion in the run-up to and following the independence referendum in Scotland Its 'Defence and Security in an independent Scotland' document considered the impact on defence in Scotland in the event of a Yes vote in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Dr Ibrahim also wrote a follow-up article expanding the Institute's findings. The institute states that it provides ‚Äúobjective analysis from credible scholars‚Äù in its compiling of reports. Its widely reported defence paper included commentary and analysis from Major-General Andrew Mackay CBE, a former Afghanistan Task Force Commander, as well as former secretaries of defence and various eminent scholars. The report, published on June 20, 2013, concluded that Scotland could have its own defence force, but that the costs would be excessive, and that the new force would not provide added security. On March 2, 2014, The Scotland Institute published a report calling for school starting age in Scotland to be lowered to the age of four. The report, titled ‚ÄòEarly Start 4 Scotland‚Äô, called for lowering the school starting age in Scotland in an effort to help children in low-income families and to better equip them to compete on the global stage. On January 26, 2016, the institute published a report on the rising number of benefit claimants in Scotland, despite an economic recovery. The report concluded that societal caps and attacks on the workplace had contributed to this rise, rather than any evidence of a ‚Äúwork- shy‚Äù population. Its mission statement, via the official website, states: ‚ÄúWe want our research to have a real, practical and lasting impact on the lives of those living in Scotland today. The Scotland Institute aims to conduct high- quality research to find innovative ways of developing a sustainable, competitive economy where wealth is fairly distributed, and the issues of social exclusion and deprivation can be tackled. Aims & Objectives: To support an intelligent debate on Scotland‚Äôs constitutional future by providing timely evidence and rigorous analysis of the issues in the debate on Scottish Independence. To turn Scotland from an economy which relies on an ever- dwindling supply of resources to a sustainable economy which relies on resources which will still be available for future generations To tackle social exclusion and the uneven distribution of wealth, so that the wealth which the Scottish economy produces benefits the poor as well as the rich. To offer policy analysis on how Scotland can make its economy more competitive.‚Äù From the institute‚Äôs website: ‚ÄúThe Scotland Institute is a progressive and independent think tank set up to deal with the changing face of Scotland. We aim to investigate the implications of devolution, find innovative solutions to the problems of social exclusion and encourage Scotland‚Äôs competitiveness in the global market. Through high-quality comprehensive research and policy making we hope to put Scotland on a path towards a more competitive, progressive, and optimistic future. We need not look far for inspiration; for like the philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment, we believe that ideas are the guiding light which can change the face of society for the better.‚Äù  External links  * References Category:Political and economic think tanks based in the United Kingdom Category:Political campaigns in the United Kingdom ","title":"Scotland Institute"},{"id":"39852827","text":"In the provinces of Estonia and Livonia of the Russian Empire, the title of the senior official was (Provincial) Marshal of Nobility () during 1783-1796, when regency for the provinces of Estonia and Livonia was introduced.

The airplane crashed into a Farrell's Ice Cream Parlor. Twenty- two people died and twenty-eight were injured. Accident The Canadair Sabre failed to gain sufficient altitude upon takeoff, with eyewitnesses suggesting the nose was over-rotated. The F-86 Sabre has a dangerous and often fatal handling characteristic upon takeoff if the nose is raised prematurely from the runway. This handling characteristic of the F-86 was acknowledged from the early 1950s. The aircraft over-ran the runway, struck an earthen berm, and ripped through a chain link fence. Two external underwing fuel tanks ruptured and ignited upon impact with the fence, creating a massive fireball. The plane continued across Freeport Boulevard, crashing into a moving car, and struck at a local Farrell's Ice Cream Parlor at approximately 4:25 pm. The parlor was occupied in part by the Sacramento 49ers junior football team. Twenty-two people died, including twelve children. An eight-year-old survivor of the accident lost nine family members: both parents, two brothers, a sister, two grandparents and two cousins. A family of four also died in the accident. Two people were killed in the car struck on Freeport Boulevard. Immediately after the crash an elderly couple trying to cross the street to the crash site were struck by a vehicle, killing the wife. The crash could have claimed many more lives if the external fuel tanks had not ruptured prior to impact, or if the jet had not been slowed by hitting the moving car and other vehicles parked in front of the restaurant. Bingham, the pilot, suffered a broken leg and broken arm. Aircraft The Canadair Sabre was a single-engine jet fighter built for the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1959. This Sabre was withdrawn from service in 1961 and placed in long-term storage. It was sold as surplus in the United States in 1971 and was bought by Spectrum Air, Inc., of Novato, California, in the same year. Aftermath The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the accident was a result of pilot error due to lack of experience on the jet. Bingham had logged fewer than four hours flying time in the Sabre. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) modified the rules governing the flight of ex-military jets over densely populated areas, and mandated clearance for such flights. Pilot requirements were also tightened: they would require a checkout by the manufacturer or military, and take-offs and landings would have to be observed by an FAA inspector to confirm proficiency. The Firefighters Burn Institute was instituted a year after the crash, funded from donations given to local firefighters. Memorial In 2002, a memorial was built at the site of the accident and dedicated in March 2003. It consists of: a rose garden with two benches, a fountain, a concrete marker and two metal plaques with the names of those who died. In 2012, a service to commemorate the 40th anniversary was held to remember the victims of the accident.

He was executive editor of The Raw Story from 2013 until 2015. Previously, he had been a journalist at the New Times LA, the editor-in-chief of the Broward-Palm Beach New Times from 2005 to 2007 and the editor-in-chief of The Village Voice from 2007 to 2012. In 2015 he was executive editor of the YouTube channel TheLipTV. He is author of the non-fiction book The Unbreakable Miss Lovely: How the Church of Scientology tried to destroy Paulette Cooper, about journalist Paulette Cooper and the Church of Scientology's attempts to silence her after her own book was published. Background and education Tony Ortega was raised in Anaheim, California. He received the John Jay Scholarship to attend Columbia University, where he completed three semesters before continuing his studies at California State University, Fullerton where he obtained his B.A. and M.A. in English. Ortega pursued more graduate work at UC Santa Cruz prior to landing his first journalism job as a freelancer at the Phoenix New Times in 1995. In 1996, Ortega reported on alleged corruption in the office of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, writing a series of stories concerning \\"misuse of state funds, poor morale inside the department, the high cost of the sheriff's posses and evidence of abuse of jail inmates,\\" for which he was nominated for the Arizona Press Club's Virg Hill Award in 1997. As a graduate student at the University of California, Ortega researched the California Agricultural Strike 1933 under the tutelage of Louis Owens. He later wrote an article about his research in the Village Voice. In her review of Ortega's article, Carolyn Kellogg wrote, \\"When Ortega gets his grandfather and great half-uncle to tell him stories of the strike, it's exactly the first-person narrative he'd been hoping for. But I found, reading the stories in his article, that they were simply personal anecdotes ‚Äî interesting anecdotes, sure, but simple anecdotes. The men camped under eucalyptus trees. They played clarinet and violin for the strikers.\\" Tony's father, also named Tony Ortega (1938-2019), was a musician, guitarist, and songwriter, starting in the late 1950s and throughout his life. He also had a career in the steel industry, joining at the entry level and rising through the ranks to become a general manager. Career =Alternative weeklies and other media= Ortega spent nearly seventeen years working for various alternative weekly newspapers in the Voice Media Group (VMG). He has worked at the Phoenix New Times, the New Times LA and The Pitch. His earliest positions ranged from staff writer to assistant editor and managing editor. In 2001 Ortega spent time with and profiled detective and conspiracy theorist William Dear for the New Times LA newspaper after Dear spent several years constructing a case around Jason Simpson (son of O.J Simpson) in the O. J. Simpson murder case. Ortega was highly critical of his methods, in particular spending two weeks impersonating a doctor in an attempt to access Jason Simpson's medical records and was later criticized for manipulating the story in order to write a book for personal gain. He became the editor-in-chief at the Broward-Palm Beach New Times in 2005 and then at The Village Voice in 2007. He was executive editor at online news website The Raw Story from 2013 to 2015. =Criticism of Scientology= Ortega first reported on Scientology in 1995 while working at the Phoenix New Times and continued covering the subject throughout his career under various media outlets in the Voice Media Group. In September 2012, Ortega publicly announced his resignation from The Village Voice in a post to the Voice's \\"Runnin' Scared\\" blog. According to former staffers, Ortega's \\"exit from the Voice was not his decision\\" and \\"his relentless pursuit of scoops on the controversial church may have been a distraction during his final months at the paper.\\" The executive editor of the Voice told the Media Decoder blog of The New York Times that Ortega \\"...did a great job for us and managed a difficult transition in a miserable economy... During that time he became the single most informed reporter on Scientology. No one is better positioned to write the book on that organization.‚Äù According to a 2012 Observer article, some staffers at the Voice expressed concern over Ortega's exclusive focus on writing anti-Scientology pieces. ‚ÄúHe was increasingly obsessed with Scientology and had neglected almost all of his editorial duties at the paper,‚Äù an ex-staffer said. ‚ÄúSometimes he wouldn‚Äôt even edit features.‚Äù Jim Underdown and Tony Ortega at HowdyCon 2019 Ortega was featured in Alex Gibney's documentary Going Clear, discussing how Scientology smeared critics. On the way to the Sundance Film Festival both Ortega and another film participant, ex-Scientologist Marc Headley, were surveilled and photographed at Salt Lake City airport by presumed members of the church, with the New York Times noting \\"The documentary showed ex-Scientologists being harassed and surveilled, a tactic that according to the film, is part of the doctrine of the church: its founder, L. Ron Hubbard, said that all of the church‚Äôs attackers were criminals whose own misdeeds should be exposed\\". In 2015 Ortega was informed by the United States Attorney that his emails had been hacked by New York private investigator Eric Saldarriaga in the previous year. Saldarriaga had received payment by clients whose names remain private and used an illegal overseas hacking group to break into several private accounts including Ortega's and ex-Scientologist and former church spokesperson Mike Rinder. Both Ortega and Rinder filed victim impact statements and requested the client's name(s) be made public. Goldstein in the New York Times reported \\"The client is said to be someone who has done investigations on behalf of the Church of Scientology, said people briefed on the case but not authorized to speak publicly.\\" 50 victims of hacking were identified and Saldarriaga was given a 3-month prison sentence in June 2015. Saldarriaga claimed he feared retaliation from naming clients while cooperating with the FBI and was never required to name the client publicly in court. In September 2018 Ortega started publishing short video clips of issues in Scientology that had been previously covered by his website. In the first video he linked Doug Dohring, the founder and CEO of Age of Learning, Inc. (also known as ABCmouse) with large donations to the Church of Scientology. =The Unbreakable Miss Lovely= In May 2015, Ortega released a book about Scientology critic Paulette Cooper and her conflict with the organization, entitled The Unbreakable Miss Lovely, which was published by Silvertail Books, an imprint of London-based literary agent and independent publisher Humfrey Hunter. The book focuses on the journalist Paulette Cooper, codenamed 'Miss Lovely' by the church, who became one of the first journalists to investigate the practices of harassment and intimidation of anyone who spoke publicly against the organization with her own published book, The Scandal of Scientology. Ortega's research into Cooper's story uncovered many previously unpublished operations by the church against Cooper, and included testimony from FBI Special Agent Christine Hansen. In an official response to the book from the church a spokesperson declined to revisit the subject and referred to Ortega as 'a parasite'. The book was well received by critics of Scientology and has been described as among the best of the genre as well as shocking. Although Cooper reached a financial settlement with the church in 1985, Ortega was accompanied by Cooper on some of the subsequent international book tour. =Freelance blog= After leaving the Voice in September 2012, Ortega began writing a freelance blog entitled The Underground Bunker that is focused solely on Scientology. The website has been described as 'devastating' to the organisation and 'influential'. It concentrates on monitoring activity within Scientology and is updated daily. =The Cult Awareness Podcast= Ortega is the co-host, along with James Underdown and Jerry Minor, of The Cult Awareness Podcast that discusses Scientology, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other subjects.

Established 12 February 1897 by Khedive Abbas Hilmi Pasha, this medal was initially to commemorate the reconquest of the Dongola province in 1896. It was subsequently authorised for later campaigns and actions until 1908. The medal was awarded with fifteen different clasps. All those who received the Khedive's Sudan Medal for service on the Nile during 1896-98 also received the Queen's Sudan Medal. Appearance The medal is circular, 39 millimetres in diameter, and awarded in silver to soldiers of the Egyptian and British armies, and in bronze to a small number of non-combatants, mainly grooms from the Indian Army and officers‚Äô servants. The obverse bears the Arabic cypher of the Khedive, and the Hijri year 1314. The reverse shows an oval shield superimposed over a trophy of flags and arms. The medal hangs from a straight bar suspension. For British troops, the recipient's name and details were engraved on the medal's edge. Those awarded to Egyptian and Sudanese recipients were named in Arabic script, although some, particularly later issues, were awarded unnamed. The ribbon of the medal is 38 mm wide. It is yellow with a broad centre stripe of blue, representing the Nile flowing through the desert. Clasps As many as ten clasps on one medal have been documented to members of the Egyptian Army. The medal is seldom seen with more than two clasps to British regiments since, apart from a number of small detachments, no British unit was present at more than two actions, the principal ones being the Atbara and Khartoum. Fifteen different clasps were authorised and awarded: *Firket (7 June 1896) *Hafir (19-26 September 1896) *Abu Hamed (7 July 1897) *Sudan 1897 *The Atbara (8 April 1898) *Khartoum (2 September 1898) (For the Battle of Omdurman) *Gedaref (7 September to 26 December 1898) *Gedid (22 November 1899) *Sudan 1899 *Bahar-ed-Ghazal 1900-02 *Jerok (January to March 1902 *Nyam-Nyam (January to May 1905) *Talodi (2-15 June 1905) *Katfia (April 1908) *Nyima (1-21 November 1908) A number of medals were awarded with no clasp, including for service during 1896 to an Indian Army force based at Suakin, and to the crews of HMS Melita and HMS Scout, that served off the Sudanese coast during the same period.

Background In the year before the by-election, the Irish Parliamentary Party had split in two after Parnell, its leader, had been cited as co-respondent in a divorce case, causing a scandal. A majority of the party's MPs left to found an Anti-Parnellite group. Three successive by-elections showed public support favouring the Anti- Parnellites.

Scope The term Beighton Junction has been used in a narrow sense to encompass either one, two or three junctions, according to author's purposes, or even as a shorthand for Beighton Junction Signalbox. The narrowest possible scope concerns the original Beighton Junction, which, essentially, stands today, i.e.: * the single, core junction of a pair of lines east from Sheffield and a pair south from Rotherham. This has been constant from 1849, referred to hereafter as Beighton Junction 1849. Beighton Junction Signalbox in 1970 \\"Beighton Junction 1849\\" in 1977 \\"Beighton Junction 1891\\" in 1977, southbound \\"Beighton Junction 1891\\" in 1977, northbound1 \\"Beighton Junction 1891\\" in 1977, northbound2 On 1 December 1891 the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire railway (MS&LR;) started running trains drawn by contractor's locomotives south from a new, additional, \\"Beighton Junction\\", approximately 500 yards north west of the first Beighton Junction on the MS&LR;, labelled in later Midland system maps as: * \\"Beighton Junction G.C.\\", referred to hereafter as Beighton Junction 1891. In 1900 the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway (LD&ECR;) made another, additional, junction yards south of the first. This pair of junctions were thereafter often referred to collectively as \\"Beighton Junction\\" as was the adjacent signal box. Their components were recorded as: * \\"GC Line Junction (Sheffield Section)\\" (the original and remaining junction Beighton Junction 1849) and, * \\"GC Line Junction (LD&EC; Section)\\", referred to hereafter as Beighton Junction 1900. This complex evolution is addressed by the accompanying Route Diagram \\"Beighton Junction detail.\\" This article treats these junctions as the lynch pin of a complex interweaving triangular network of lines, stretching over two miles from Killamarsh in the south to station in the north west and to in the north east. That triangle as a whole is addressed by the accompanying Route Diagram \\"Beighton Junction\\". Overview Beighton Junction went through four distinct phases: * Initial simplicity from 1849 to 1891 * Sudden expansion from 1891 to 1907 * Consolidation then decline from 1907 to the 1980s, then * Return to simplicity since the 1980s. Initial simplicity The MSLR's \\"Beighton Branch\\" and the original Beighton Junction opened to passenger traffic on 12 February 1849. The branch and junction joined the MSLR's east-west main line to the Midland Railway's erstwhile North Midland Railway line from to which still runs south-north along the valley of the River Rother. The MS&LR;'s station opened at the same time. The MS&LR; line had been promoted by the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway (S&LJ;). The first sod was ceremonially cut at High Hazles (nowadays spelled High Hazels and better known as Darnall) in eastern Sheffield on 15 October 1846, to the customary celebrations. The S&LJ; and other associated lines were amalgamated in 1847 to form the MS&LR.; The junction made it possible to run trains from Sheffield eastwards, then turn southwards. At the time the modern line directly south from Sheffield was some way from becoming a financial and engineering possibility. The Midland Railway (MR) allowed MS&L; trains to run south two stops beyond Beighton Junction to Eckington where passengers had to change for Chesterfield and beyond. This essentially local scheme continued for forty years. It was condemned to remain local in scope by the opening in 1870 of what was to become known as the \\"New Road\\" direct from Sheffield through Bradway Tunnel and . This \\"New Road\\" led to the Midland Line along the Rother Valley becoming known among railwaymen as the \\"Old Road.\\" Some attempts were made to run through trains from the MS&L;, notably to London, but these more often fell foul of railway politics than operating or financial difficulties. In essence, the MS&L; was a provincial railway with ambitions but no cash, the Midland and the LNWR had the lines to the south and the whip hand. Sudden expansion =The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway= The MS&LR; was extremely ambitious. On 11 July 1889 its \\"Derbyshire Lines\\" Bill was passed by the Lords and by the following January contracts were let for a new line to be built from Beighton to Chesterfield. On 7 February 1890 the first sod was cut at Beighton. The \\"Derbyshire Lines\\" expansion had two overall aims: * to break the Midland's stranglehold on the rapidly expanding coal traffic to and from the Derbyshire/Nottinghamshire coalfield, and * to gain access to wider, notably Nottingham and London, markets by joining with the GNR at Annesley, north of Nottingham. Naturally, the Midland objected, both in parliament and elsewhere. The \\"Derbyshire Lines\\" in question were: * a new main line from the MS&L;'s Beighton Branch to the GNR at Annesley. This would provide an entirely MS&L; West-South route. * a new branch from Waleswood, on the MS&L; main line east of the Rother, to join the new main line a little over a mile south of the new Beighton Junction, thereby providing an entirely MS&L; East-South route, and * a new branch leaving the new main line at Staveley to serve Chesterfield and, especially, the ambitious and expanding works in the Staveley area. On 9 May 1890 Parliament granted the MS&L; powers to extend the Chesterfield branch southwards to the new main line at Heath, thereby forming a loop. The initial aim of opening in June 1891 proved over-optimistic, but openings came thick and fast: * December 1891: goods traffic to Staveley Works via the new Beighton Junction commenced, using contractors' locomotives. * 1 June 1892: public passenger service from Sheffield (MS&L;, later Victoria) via Beighton to Staveley Town, later Staveley Central. * 1 June 1892: erstwhile passenger service via Beighton to Eckington (MR) ceased. * 4 June 1892: public passenger service extended to Chesterfield (later Chesterfield Central). * 24 October 1892: new main line south from Staveley to Annesley opened, allowing MS&L; coal and goods trains to reach Nottingham, a key goal of the enterprise. * 3 January 1893: passenger traffic started south from Staveley to * 3 July 1893: passenger traffic through Chesterfield to started, completing the loop and enabling MS&L; trains to travel to Nottingham both  direct between Staveley and Heath, or  round by the Chesterfield Loop, a situation which continued for almost seventy years. * 17 July 1893: Waleswood Curve opened for goods traffic, giving the MS&L; East to South access to the new main line. * 1 November 1893: station, itself a replacement for an earlier station on the Midland's \\"Old Road\\", replaced with the third and final Beighton station. * January 1894: Waleswood Curve opened to passenger traffic.Waleswood Curve: via kivetonwaleshistory The gateway to this frenetic activity was the MS&L;'s new Beighton Junction. The Midland's ire must be understood not in the trivial loss of transfer passenger traffic at Eckington, but in the consequent opening of the Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire coalfield to railway competition. From 1891 to 1894 no fewer than seventeen new colliery branches were opened by the MS&L; off the lines catalogued above, most leading to pits already served by the Midland. One such was the Holbrook Colliery Branch which left the new southbound MS&L; main line merely yards from their new Beighton Junction. This new Beighton Junction proved to be the springboard for yet more ambition. Later in the 1890s the MS&L; sets its sights on getting to London under its own steam and built the \\"London Extension\\" south from Annesley to . The MS&LR; became the GCR and the London Extension became the Great Central Main Line. MS&L; locals to Killamarsh, coals from Holbrook Colliery and crack expresses from Marylebone to Sheffield Victoria, all were made possible by the MS&LR;'s junction, the second at Beighton. =The Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway= In the 1880s a grandiose scheme was formulated to build a railway from \\"Coast to Coast\\", i.e. from near Warrington on the emerging Manchester Ship Canal (not actually on the coast, but near enough for sloganising purposes) to a wholly new port near Sutton-on-Sea in Lincolnshire. In November 1890 detailed plans for this new line - to be known as the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway (LD&ECR;) - were made public, they included a branch from Langwith to Beighton, aiming at the expanding heavy industry in Sheffield. Notice seeking to put a Bill before Parliament was given in the same month. Effective groundwork had been done so that only 37 petitions objecting to the new line were tabled. Most of those from landowners were \\"successfully dealt with\\" (i.e. \\"bought out\\" or mitigated, so they were withdrawn) and those from the CLC, LNWR and GN&GEJR; were subsequently withdrawn when they became satisfied that the proposed line was either neutral or advantageous to them. The GER went one step further, changing from opponents to supporters, as they saw that the line could give them access to Sheffield and to North Midlands coal. This left two opponents, the MR and the MS&LR.; The Midland's opposition was lukewarm, they saw both opportunities and threats: * opportunities such as Beighton, where the LD&ECR;'s traffic would end in a floodplain on the outskirts of Sheffield and would need carrying further, potentially over Midland metals, and * threats such as Southgate and Barlborough near Clowne where collieries which they served exclusively might be tapped by the new line. The MS&L;'s opposition was by far the strongest, not least because the proposed line broadly paralleled their established main line from East to West and would potentially be a direct competitor. Their rumbustious leader, Watkin, described the proposed line as \\"one of the maddest schemes ever presented to Parliament.\\" So little opposition, and that from a partial source, meant the Bill sailed through Parliament and received Royal Assent on 5 August 1891, the biggest line authorised in a single session. That was the easy bit. Investors prepared to back the scheme were thin on the ground and by the Autumn of 1891 the decision was taken to start building eastwards from Chesterfield to meet the GN&GEJR; at Pyewipe Junction west of Lincoln and northwards from Langwith Junction towards Beighton, which would occasionally be referred to as the \\"Sheffield Branch\\" but much more widely as the Beighton Branch. As things turned out they were the only two stretches of line which would be built. As late as 1896 the LD&ECR; still had no means of getting into Sheffield and the Beighton Branch still looked set to end in a marsh next to the Rother. In that year a scheme was passed by Parliament permitting the building of the Sheffield District Railway (SDR) from a point on the LD&ECR;'s Beighton Branch near Barlborough to Attercliffe in Sheffield's northern industrial heartland. This route was both difficult and expensive at a time when the LD&ECR; was having trouble financing its Chesterfield-Lincoln main line. The driving forces behind the SDR were Sheffield businessmen and the company was legally independent, but the LD&ECR; saw it as a child of its own. Despite the lack of finances the Duke of Norfolk cut the first sod in Attercliffe in 1896. The Byzantine railway politics of the period then threw up another surprise, the Midland Railway jumped off the fence and offered the LD&ECR; and SDR another route into Sheffield. Instead of embarking from Barlborough off the Beighton Branch, the line could: * make an East-North junction with the Midland Railway's \\"Old Road\\" at Beighton, using LD&ECR; metals already under construction * use Midland metals to * build a much shorter and cheaper version of the SDR westwards from Treeton, joining the Midland's Sheffield-Rotherham line south of * use Midland metals southwards through * build a short branch to the goods depot under construction in Attercliffe, and * let passenger trains run beyond Attercliffe to the Midland's Pond Street station at . This was the railway which was actually built. As a result: * the LD&ECR; had a viable route into Sheffield at little extra cost * the shortened SDR could be built at a fraction of the original cost * the GER, who had running rights over the LD&ECR;, gained access to Sheffield for nothing * the Midland would gain revenues where LD&ECR; trains ran over its metals * the Midland gained influence over the SDR as the latter ran onto the Midland at both ends, and * the Midland cocked a snook at the MS&LR.; The East-North junction at Beighton, usually referred to in sources simply as \\"Beighton Junction\\", was the third Beighton Junction, as shown on the \\"Beighton Junction Detail\\" route diagram. It was formally opened by the Duke of Norfolk on 21 May 1900, along with the SDR. Goods and mineral traffic started on 28 May and passengers on 30 May 1900. =The Great Central Railway= In 1897 the MS&LR; changed its name to the Great Central Railway (GCR) in anticipation of reaching in 1899. Its change of name and scale did not dim its expansionist character. By 1905 the LD&ECR;, which had never been strongly capitalised, was in financial difficulty, despite a strong growth in traffic, notably freight tonnage which had risen from 477,374 tons carried in 1896 to 2,317,714 tons carried in 1905. Its end as an independent company was rapid by any criteria: * 7 November 1905 the Board resolved to offer the company for sale to the Great Northern Railway (GNR) * 9 November 1905 the GNR replied, saying that none of the LD&ECR;'s proposed methods of sale was acceptable * 10 November 1905 the Board met again and offered the company for sale to the GCR, who had representatives in attendance.  Terms were agreed there and then, with the aim of takeover from 1 January 1907.  It was agreed that the necessary Parliamentary Bill would include the construction of junctions between the two systems. 1906-7 saw the construction and opening of two wholly separate sets of junctions between the LD&ECR; and the GCR: * Duckmanton Junction where the LD&ECR; \\"Main Line\\" and Great Central Main Line (GCML) crossed between Staveley and Heath, and * Killamarsh South and North Junctions, approximately 1.5 miles south of the LD&ECR;'s Beighton Junction. These latter two are shown on the \\"Beighton Junction detail\\" route diagram. Their positioning south of Killamarsh Junction meant that trains off the LD&ECR; could travel: * to and from the GCR's lines in Sheffield without touching Midland metals,GCML to LDECR: via picturethepast and * eastwards via the Waleswood Curve The GCR had the last laugh over the Midland regarding the LD&ECR.; Having bitterly opposed the LD&ECR; (\\"...one of the maddest schemes...\\") and suffered the Midland's ploy of enabling the LD&ECR; to get to the heart of Sheffield under the GCR's noses the GCR now owned the usurper and had its trains running over Midland metals to Attercliffe and points nearby. Whatever scores may have been settled the GCR had certainly scotched the competitive threat posed by the LD&ECR; and went on to make significant use of its metals, most notably as the Nottinghamshire Coalfield spread eastwards. =Other lines= Over time the triangle described in this article also contained: * the River Rother * the Chesterfield Canal * five railway branch lines:  the Crown Paper Mills branch  the North Staveley Curve  Glovers Siding  the MR's Killamarsh Branch and Extension, and  the Holbrook Colliery Branch * a wagon works * two substantial locomotive scrapyards:  Thos W Ward at Beighton, and  Thos W Ward at Killamarsh * two significant railway yards:  Beighton Yard, off the ex-GCR Beighton Branch, and  Beighton Sidings, ex-LD&ECR; Significantly, no roads ran along the valley bottom, and few crossed it, as the river was and is prone to flooding. The natural course of the Rother was slow and meandering, straight out of school geography textbook diagrams. The North Midland \\"Old Road\\" did some straightening, but by virtue of coming first it took the easiest and driest line. The lines which undertook the most preventive work were the Waleswood Curve and the LD&ECR;, the former in particular diverted a horseshoe bend in the river to end up with just one crossing - Bedgreave Viaduct - instead of many. The GCR became a significant victim of the river, in 1937, for example, Beighton station flooded above rail level and by 1950 was forced to undertake platform raising and other works, partly as a result of flood damage and partly as a preventive measure. As was often the case, railways addressed the same transport needs as canals and faced similar obstacles. The Chesterfield Canal sought to move heavy goods between early industrial North Derbyshire and South Yorkshire and to connect both with the North Sea via the River Trent. Its most famous traffic - Anston stone for the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament following a disastrous fire in 1834 - was transferred from narrowboats to seagoing craft and taken thereby to the Thames. The MS&LR; had a similar objective in building the Waleswood Curve, as well as the additional spur of meeting a clamour of traffic in the opposite direction - iron ore for Staveley Works. Both the canal and the railway faced the problem of climbing eastwards out of the Rother valley. James Brindley made best use of the technology of his day to build Norwood Locks, immediately followed by Norwood Tunnel which emerged within a stone's throw of what would later be the MS&LR; main line near Kiveton Park Colliery. The Waleswood Curve took advantage of later technology and greater resources. It smoothed out the same climb by taking a longer route. It, too, had a tunnel - Waleswood Tunnel - which was a mere long compared with Brindley's . Railways in general rendered most narrow canals uneconomic, but the Chesterfield Canal suffered an additional blow when Norwood Tunnel collapsed in 1907. The five railway branch lines varied considerably. The Crown Paper Mills branch first appeared on OS maps in 1899‚Äì1900. The branch turned a sharp right angle north eastwards off the GCR Beighton Branch immediately north west of the third Beighton Station. It served the Crown Paper Mills until the 1940s, after which the mills' site was used by George Slater's scrap metal business. OS maps show rail connections to the site until the 1970s. No evidence suggests that this scrapyard dismantled railway locomotives. The North Staveley Curve turned sharply eastwards off the MR's \\"Old Road\\" between the 1849 Beighton Junction and Beighton Viaduct, which carries the MS&LR;'s east-west main line over the Rother and the MR's Old Road. The branch was so named because it served North Staveley Colliery, Aston. The line was laid when the company bought and developed Aston Colliery in the 1860s. The 1854 OS map shows the colliery and a tramway running southwards, seemingly to end at right angles to the MS&LR; main line. 1877‚Äì92 OS maps show the developed position, with the tramroad from the colliery crossing the MS&LR; at right angles to enter coal handling facilities immediately south thereof, on Midland metals. Later in the colliery's life the tramway was replaced by a conveyor belt. The coal handling facilities in later years consisted of a hopper, from which coal was dropped into railway wagons. The North Staveley Curve appears to have joined the MS&LR; at North Staveley Junction a short distance west of the coal handling facilities, opened on 1 January 1870 but later sources make no mention of \\"North Staveley Junction\\" referring consistently to Brookhouse Junction as described below. The North Staveley Colliery Company was intimately connected with the Staveley Coal and Iron Company, based in Staveley, ten miles to the south. When the company bought the mine the MS&LR;'s \\"Derbyshire Lines\\" were far into the future so the Midland Railway was the natural partner to transport the coal southwards, as they already served the ironworks on a large scale. The Midland System Diagrams of 1918 show North Staveley Colliery as \\"Aston Colliery\\". \\"Beighton Colliery\\" (or sometimes \\"Beighton Pit\\") appears on OS maps from 1905 to 1924 to 1967. The colliery is shown on the Midland Railway System Maps dated 1918 as being served by the joint MR & GCR \\"Beighton Colliery Branch\\", which ran east-west immediately south of the GCR Sheffield-Worksop line. This branch connected to the North Staveley Curve in such a way that Midland trains travelling between the Midland's Old Road and the colliery would have to reverse into and out of branch. GCR trains could proceed straight ahead to the eastern end of the North Staveley Curve and on towards Worksop by what would later be known as Brookhouse Junction. The same maps show that the later Brookhouse Colliery and its coke worksBrookhouse Colliery and Coke Ovens: via flickr connected both to the North Staveley Curve and to the Sheffield-Retford line,Brookhouse Sidings: via Wikicommons the latter connection having a signalbox for that purpose. Sinking Brookhouse Colliery commenced in 1929 and eventually joined Aston's North Staveley Colliery workings underground, leading to the latter's closure. The hopper mentioned above in connection with North Staveley Colliery appears to have been used to handle Brookhouse Colliery's output in later years. Trains from the ex-GCR east-west line reversed empty wagons under the hopper after which they were allowed to run forward under gravity whilst coal was dropped into them. Brookhouse coking plant ceased production in October 1981 and Brookhouse Colliery closed on 26 October 1985. Brookhouse Colliery signalbox followed the next year.Brookhouse Colliery signalbox: via signalboxes Glovers Siding served Glover's Victoria Flour Mill (sometimes referred to as \\"Valley Mills\\"), a prominent Killamarsh structure between the GCR and LD&ECR; embankments.[ Glover's Flour Mill, Killamarsh]Glover's Mill, Killamarsh: via picturethepastGlover's Flour Mill: via j31 The single track branch turned south west off the LD&ECR; line approximately opposite Killamarsh North Junction. It immediately fell very steeply to ground level then ran south to the mill, making yet another crossing of the Rother in the process. The mill and branch do not appear on the 1905 OS map, but are shown on the 1924 version. The Midland Railway's Killamarsh Branch opened in 1869, being extended to Kiveton Park in 1878; it survived in part until 1972 and has since been lifted.Killamarsh Branch & Extension: via kivetonwaleshistoryKillamarsh Branch & Extension: via signalboxes It turned east off the Midland's Old Road at Killamarsh Branch Junction, passed under a farm track then crossed what was initially open water meadows. When the MS&LR; built their Derbyshire Lines and the LD&ECR; their Beighton Branch (see above) both crossed the Killamarsh Branch by overbridges and the GCR Walewood Curve ran away northeastwards on an embankment, resulting in a complete character transformation of the first couple of hundred yards of the branch. This was heightened after the Second World War when Thos W Ward's Killamarsh Scrapyard opened immediately east of the LD&ECR; overbridge. This scrapyard was connected to the branch and specialised in cutting up railway rolling stock, notably wagons and locomotives, for which it became famous in railway enthusiast circles. Truly remarkable footage of this scrapyard in 1960 and 1964 is available on DVD. On-line sources of the size and detail of locomotive \\"disposals\\" differ but give an idea of the scale of the operation.Ward's of Killamarsh: via brdatabaseWard's of Killamarsh: via railukLocos at Ward's of Killamarsh: via flickr Many references to Ward's of Killamarsh confuse the site with the company's other scrapyard in this article's area, Ward's of Beighton. The two were about a mile and a half apart. Apart from the later arrival of Ward's, the branch served three collieries and a chemical works in its mere three miles, and packed in a tunnel to boot. Notable locations were, from the west: * Thos W Ward's Killamarsh scrapyard * Ellison and Mitchell's (later Yorkshire Tar Distillers) plant * Norwood Colliery (sometimes referred to as Holbrook No. 2 colliery) * West Kiveton Colliery near Mansfield Road, Killamarsh * Norwood End Tunnel No.10 ( long,Tunnel Lengths: via www.railwaycodes.org.uk which now passes under the M1),Norwood End Tunnel No.10: via picturethepastNorwood End Tunnel, eastern exit: via j31 and * Kiveton Park Colliery. Restorers of the Chesterfield Canal have considered using the tunnel, which survives, as a means of getting under the M1, the original canal tunnel having collapsed in part in 1907. To the naked eye this seems an \\"obvious\\" solution, but the railway tunnel, like most of the branch extension, is on slope steep by railway standards. As canals require level pounds at least one lock would be necessary inside the tunnel, which would involve digging out the bottom and threatening both the structure's integrity and the M1 above. The final branch in this article's area is the MS&LR;'s Holbrook Colliery Branch. Holbrook No. 1 Colliery was situated immediately west of the Midland's Killamarsh station. The Midland had served the colliery for many years when the MS&LR; built their branch to the colliery as part of their Derbyshire Lines expansion in the 1890s, described above. The single track branch left the MS&LR;'s Beighton Branch a short distance south of the third and final Beighton station and ran parallel to what would become the GCML as far as its lattice girder overbridge over the Midland's Old Road, after which it ran parallel to the Old Road to the colliery. The pit closed in 1944 and was demolished in 1961, though most of the ex-GCR branch was lifted before then. A train using the branch was involved in a fatal accident on 11 February 1942. Metal sheets in a wagon being shunted became dislodged and protruded into the path of a troop train on the adjacent \\"Down\\" (northbound) ex-GCR main line. The metal sliced into some of the coaches killing several sailors and injuring more.Beighton Accident Report: via annesleyfiremanBeighton Accident: via bbc A Wagon Works first appeared on OS maps of the area in 1923.Beighton Wagon Works 1:2500 OS map: via Old-Maps It was situated in the \\"V\\" of the 1849 Beighton Junction, accessed from the GCR Beighton Branch from the north west, though it could be accessed from the MR Old Road by turning from south to north west, then reversing. Intriguingly, the map also shows a building labelled \\"Engine Shed\\". Staying on the same website, by 1956 the site was labelled \\"Wagon Repair Works\\". The access lines appear unchanged from the 1923 map. At some point after the Second World War the wagon works were taken over by the scrap merchant Thos W Ward and used for breaking up redundant railway rolling stock, including locomotives, with railway literature referring to the site as both wagon works and Ward's.Wagon Works or Ward's: via flickr The location is close to the \\"V\\" of the junction, as can be seen from the attached image, where the photographer was on a diverted train travelling from the Old Road to the Beighton Branch, with the Old Road clearly visible to the right of the yard, and Brookhouse Colliery and coke ovens in the distance, north east of camera.Ward's Beighton location: via flickr Like its fellow site at Killamarsh, it became a focus of interest for railway enthusiasts, but was much less accessible without trespass, with the result that fewer photographs survive. The DVD cited in the context of Ward's at Killamarsh also contains images of Ward's at Beighton, but the commentary is confusing. Similarly, on- line sources of the size and detail of locomotive \\"disposals\\" differ but give an idea of the scale of the operation.Ward's of Beighton: via brdatabaseWard's of Beighton: via railuk Many references to Ward's at Beighton confuse the site with the company's other scrapyard in this article's area, Ward's at Killamarsh. The two were about a mile and a half apart. A goods yard, elsewhere referred to as Beighton Yard, first appeared on OS maps of the area in 1950‚Äì51. It was situated in the \\"V\\" of Woodhouse Junction, where the ex- MS&LR; main line and their Beighton Branch diverged from 1849 onwards. This is at the extreme top left of the Beighton Branch Route Diagram accompanying this article. The OS map was published in 1950, but the map's data may be from before the Second World War. The yard connected to the Beighton Branch at both ends. The accompanying image of a V2 shows it heading northwestwards along the Beighton Branch immediately before Woodhouse Junction, with tracks to Worksop heading eastwards at the extreme bottom left of the image.Beighton Yard: via signalboxes As a footnote, this image shows a rare \\"out of gauge\\" trap point, two such have been installed new on the Welsh Highland Railway to protect the Cae Pawb level crossing with the ex-Cambrian Railway line at Porthmadog. A further goods yard, built by the LD&ECR; and known as Beighton Sidings, existed immediately south of the 1900 Beighton Junction, next the LD&ECR; running lines on their eastern side. The sidings were controlled by a classic LD&ECR; signalbox known as Beighton Sidings, situated approximately south of the junction, which closed on 13 October 1952 and was demolished in 1957. The Midland Railway System Maps show the northern end of the yard as connecting directly onto the North Staveley Curve, as do OS maps.Beighton Sidings 1923 1:2500 OS map: via Old-Maps A remnant can be seen below the signalbox in the signalbox diagram of the ex-MR Beighton Junction signalbox, which closed in 1982. Lines and Junctions This narrative has described many lines which interlock in the article's area. Some of these lines are short and self- contained whilst others travel further afield and link to others the length and breadth of the land.

By 1922 some 34 regular passenger trains, Monday to Friday, were timetabled to pass northwards through the three Beighton Junctions, plus a similar number southbound. Services varied at weekends, typically with more on Saturdays and fewer on Sundays. The 34 consisted of: * along the GCML, turning left at the 1891 Beighton Junction  12 stoppers  1 semifast from Leicester Central  5 expresses from Marylebone  1 overnight train from Marylebone carrying mail and passengers, and  5 from the Southwest to points north, such as Bournemouth-York and Penzance-Glasgow * along the LD&ECR; Beighton Branch, turning right at the 1900 Beighton Junction  3 stoppers * along the Midland Railway Old Road, straight through the 1849 Beighton Junction  7 stoppers. The Waleswood Curve The sole exception was Summer excursion and holiday traffic between North Derbyshire and the east coast via the Waleswood Curve, but this was neither vast nor frequent, the final Summer of operation consisted of the 07:36 Chesterfield Central to Skegness and return, Saturdays Only, from 1 July to 26 August 1961. The curve never carried local passenger traffic. The LD&ECR; Beighton Branch Regular, timetabled east-west traffic along the Sheffield Victoria to Worksop line is outside the scope of this article, except in times of strain or exceptional load, when the LD&ECR;'s Beighton Branch served as a diversionary route, in conjunction with the LD&ECR; main line east of Langwith Junction. Some east coast Summer holiday traffic from Manchester Central and Sheffield Victoria was routed via the 1892 MS&LR; Beighton Junction, Killamarsh North Junction, Killamarsh South Junction, the LD&ECR; Beighton Branch, Langwith Junction and Pyewipe Junction until 1964.Summer 1964 Working Timetable(1): via flickrSummer 1964 Working Timetable(2): via flickrSummer 1963 Working Timetable: via psul4all The Sheffield-Worksop line had two long-distance services, the \\"Master Cutler\\" from 1958 and for many years the daily - boat train. This latter was occasionally diverted using the same route, bringing March Britannias through the remains of . The Beighton Branch also served as an overflow and diversionary route for the GCML, with northbound trains leaving the latter at Kirkby South Junction and travelling up the Leen Valley Extension through to Langwith Junction then to Sheffield using the route described above, regaining the GCML at Killamarsh North Junction. Southbound trains reversed the process. A notable variation on this routing was the \\"Starlight Express\\" sleeping car service between Marylebone and Glasgow St Enoch and Stirling which ran from 1962 to 1964 to free up the West Coast Main Line for electrification work. In 1963 at least, some of these trains did not regain the GCML at Killamarsh North Junction, but ran through to the 1900 Beighton Junction with the Old Road then turned north to Masborough, the Settle-Carlisle Line and the Glasgow and South Western Railway route into Scotland.Summer 1963 Working Timetable: via psul4all Other trains in this quite extensive service ran straight up the GCML, through the 1892 Beighton Junction and headed northwards via Sheffield Victoria. Two further passenger flows passed southeastwards to and from the LD&ECR; route at one of the Beighton Junctions: * Excursions and special trains sometimes took the route described above, via the 1892 Beighton Junction and Killamarsh North and South Junctions, e.g.:  football specials, often connected with matches involving Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough near , west of Sheffield Victoria  simple \\"excursions\\" sometimes in connection with an event or to attract shoppers, and  enthusiasts' specials, such as the Flying Scotsman \\"Great Central Railtour\\" of 18 April 1964 * Timetabled stopping passenger trains plied between Sheffield Midland and Bradshaw, August 1939: via flickr but they took a different route through this article's area. Having set off northeastwards from Sheffield they swung east along the Sheffield District Railway then south onto the \\"Old Road\\" at Treeton Junction to approach the 1900 Beighton Junction from the north, whereupon they turned southeast (left) onto the LD&ECR.; This service's trains consisted of LD&ECR; stock hauled by Midland locomotives. This arrangement was a quid pro quo for the GCR not exercising the LD&ECR;'s running rights into the Midland's Sheffield station. The Midland then the LMSR both took pains to observe the agreement as they suspected that the GCR and the LNER would jump at the chance to seize their pound of flesh if it were broken. The service lasted until the outbreak of World War II, when it was summarily withdrawn. From 1988 into the early 1990s a preservation group named the \\"Rother Valley Railway\\" had a brief existence on the site of station. The line had three locomotives on loan, a five-ton steam crane and a membership of over eighty. Although the line featured in a two-page article in Railway Magazine in 1990 little seems to have happened and the society faded away. The Midland Railway \\"Old Road\\" After 1870, when the Midland Railway opened its \\"New Road\\" direct between Sheffield to Chesterfield via Bradway Tunnel the \\"Old Road\\" running north-south through the 1849 and 1900 Beighton Junctions became a passenger backwater. Apart from diversions and specials there was only a very thin stopping service. In 1922 these \\"Old Road\\" passenger services were at their most intensive: * On Sundays only  stopping trains plied directly between and Chesterfield (MR) * On Mondays to Saturdays three stopping services plied between Sheffield (MR) and Chesterfield  most ran direct along the \\"New Road\\" through * the other two set off northeastwards from Sheffield (MR) towards Rotherham then swung east to go the \\"long way round\\" via the \\"Old Road\\"  one of these continued past , a short distance before Masboro', then swung hard right, next stop , heading south  the other continued past then swung right onto the Sheffield District Railway passing through or calling at and before turning south onto the Old Road at Treeton Junction. These services had fizzled out by 1954, the stations on the Old Road having closed in dribs and drabs in the early 1950s, with the last to close on 5 July 1954, but that was on the cessation of services along the Clowne Branch; Old Road stopping services appear to have ended on 1 February 1954. Specials, excursions and Summer Holiday trains, such as the Summer Saturdays Filey Holiday Camp-King's Norton, which passed between Rotherham and Chesterfield but did not stop at Sheffield continued for some time. The 1963 WTT shows the following flows north-south straight through the 1849 Beighton Junction: * Midlands-Yorkshire Coast, e.g. Leicester London Road‚ÄîScarborough Central * Northern England-South Coast, e.g. Bradford Forster Square‚ÄîPaignton * Midlands-Scotland Car Carrier between Stirling and Sutton Coldfield, and * a lone \\"Starlight Express\\" variant, from Kettering to Glasgow St. Enoch, Fridays Only, northbound only.Summer 1963 Working Timetable: via psul4all In 1965 a connecting spur was installed between the former Nunnery Colliery Branch and the ex-MS&LR; Main Line a quarter of a mile east of Sheffield Victoria. This allowed trains from Sheffield Midland to run north eastwards onto ex-MS&LR; metals and vice versa. From 4 October of that year most services which had run to and from the east into Sheffield Victoria were diverted to Sheffield Midland. This had no direct, daily effect on Beighton Junction, but it did open up the possibility of diverted trains using Beighton as a diversionary route. Diverted southbound trains could travel northeast from Sheffield Midland onto the ex-MS&LR; line, east to Woodhouse Junction, southeast to the Beighton Junction 1849 then southwards down the Old Road to regain their conventional route at Tapton Junction north of Chesterfield. Northbound trains could reverse the process. Such diversions occurred from time to time, with the complete closure of the New Road from 17 August to 7 September 1969 for the demolition of Broomhouse Tunnel providing a prolonged example. Football specials for Hillsborough Football ground ran to from the Midland Main Line and places such as Birmingham ran for many years, being able to run northwards up the old Road then turn west (left) at the 1849 Beighton Junction, straight through Sheffield Victoria to Wadsley Bridge. This was doubly more convenient than running through Sheffield Midland as it avoided a reversal at Nunnery Junction and avoided the relatively congested New Road and Sheffield Midland itself. The Great Central Main Line The greatest passenger flow through Beighton Junction was West-South. * The 1849‚Äì1870 period posed considerable obstacles to southward travel to and from Sheffield. Their origins were geographical - the barrier posed by hills between Sheffield and Chesterfield - but the hotch potch of solutions stemmed as much from railway rivalry as from the industry's immaturity. In essence, the Midland Railway held a monopoly which it only allowed the MS&LR; to nibble at with trains to Eckington, where passengers would have to change to Midland trains. * By opening Bradway Tunnel in 1870 the Midland consolidated their monopoly on traffic south from Sheffield; few would prefer to travel west-south on the MS&L; via Beighton Junction (1849) to Eckington, change trains to Chesterfield then change again for the south when they could travel south direct. * The MS&LR;'s 1891 Beighton Junction opened new opportunities for passengers to travel west-south to and from Sheffield. A traveller could use the new \\"Derbyshire Lines\\" to reach GNR services in Nottingham and then go further, but once again, few would do so in preference to simply going south through Bradway Tunnel. The Derbyshire Lines did, however, open local travel opportunities to places such as Staveley. * The Great Central's \\"London Extension\\" of 1899 built a wholly new line connecting the Derbyshire lines at Annesley, north of Nottingham to The Metropolitan Railway near Aylesbury and a new terminus at . This was a game-changer for Beighton Junction. At a stroke the 1891 Beighton Junction started handling express passenger services and intending travellers had a real, as opposed to notional, choice of route south from Sheffield. The Great Central's services offered competition to the Midland, but the deck was stacked against the former: * service quality was comparable * the Midland was well-established in travellers' minds and habits * the GCR route was 3.3% longer, putting pressure on costs * apart from the climb to Bradway Tunnel, the Midland route was more easily graded, and * the Midland's Sheffield station was more central, as was St Pancras. This meant the Great Central could only compete on two fronts - price and speed. To compete on price they had to undercut the Midland or carry more passengers or some combination of the two. By 1905 Great Central express services were quicker from London to Sheffield than the Midland, but at the expense of having to run five coach trains including a restaurant car. Much enterprise was shown in the Edwardian period to attract customers to the new line, but in modern business parlance it lacked a unique selling point. By 1922 the Midland's London services were quicker than the Great Central's, typically by 15 to 30 minutes On Saturday 13 September 1958 the last Master Cutler ran via Beighton Junction, being recast as a diesel-hauled Pullman service from Sheffield Victoria to via on and from the following Monday. The last year-round daytime services from Marylebone through Beighton Junction to Sheffield and Manchester ran on Saturday 2 January 1960. From the following Monday they were either withdrawn or truncated at . The line's last named train, the -Marylebone \\"South Yorkshireman\\" was replaced by a service in two parts. The first ran from Halifax via to Sheffield Midland where, after a considerable wait it was joined by a portion from . The combined train then ran to . Stopping trains on the GCML north of Nottingham last ran on 3 March 1963. Through Summer holiday trains ran again that year, with at least two long-established overnight trains plying west-south through the 1891 Beighton Junction: * Manchester Piccadilly‚ÄîHastings, and * Dover Marine‚ÄîNewcastleSummer 1963 Working Timetable: via psul4all This left four regular, year-round timetabled passenger trains through the 1892 Beighton Junction up to the closure of the GCML as a through route on 5 September 1966. The \\"Up\\" (southbound) four were: * 10:08 York - Poole, which left Sheffield Victoria at 11:37 and passed Beighton Junction around 11:52 * 18:40 York - Swindon, which left Sheffield Victoria at 20:55 and passed Beighton Junction around 21:10 * 22:20 York - Swindon, which left Sheffield Victoria at 00:09 and passed Beighton Junction around 00:24, and * 23:05 Manchester Central - Marylebone, which left Sheffield Victoria at 00:45 and passed Beighton Junction around 01:00 This last, in the early hours of 4 September 1966, was the final Sheffield Victoria-Marylebone via ex-GCR metals. Further south, near Kirkby Bentinck, the line was severed almost immediately, with colour light signals still glowing red, though traffic to Arkwright Colliery via Duckmanton Junction continued for some years. With this closure also ended the GCR's other notable passenger role - excursions and special traffic. The line's relative over- capacity, its long-distance connections and its access to Wembley Stadium made special traffic to hockey, football and Rugby League matches significant business, especially after World War II. The Manchester Central-Marylebone on 4 September 1966 was the last timetabled train south onto the GCML via the 1891 Beighton Junction, but the final passenger train of all passed in 1977 or 1978 when the Royal Train travelled northwards along the Old Road, turned left (westwards) at the 1849 Beighton Junction, came to a halt in the site of Beighton's third station, then reversed gingerly over the 1891 Beighton Junction onto the Up line of the remaining stump of the GCML, coming to a halt in the vicinity of the lattice girder bridge over the Old Road. The view westwards from the carriages can hardly have been edifying, as the erstwhile Down line was occupied by redundant goods wagons as far as the eye could see. Other lines None of the \\"other lines\\" described above ever carried a passenger service. =Freight= As with passenger traffic, the dominant freight flows were between the south, southeast & east and the west, northwest & north. Once again, the exception was the Waleswood Curve. The Waleswood Curve The Staveley Coal and Iron Company lobbied for the curve as a means of getting coal and North Lincolnshire iron ore to their works at Staveley. This traffic waned as other sources were found and the Appleby-Frodingham Steel Company scooped up most of the ore at source. By the 1960s traffic was thin, with photographic evidence suggesting that one daily train - a New Clee- Banbury express fish - provided the line's principal traffic.Fish Train nearing Waleswood: via j31 That this traffic survived into the 1960s is perhaps surprising, as similar trains, collectively known as \\"Whitland Fish\\", ran between the same places, but diagrammed via the five miles shorter route via Lincoln, Pyewipe Junction, the LD&ECR; Main Line to Clipstone East Junction then down the ex-Mansfield Railway line to the GCML at Kirkby South Junction. When the ex-GCR Main Line closed as a through route in 1966 the Waleswood Curve lost any possibility of through traffic to or from the south. Trains running up the ex-LD&ECR; Beighton Branch could use the curve to head east, though there was little historical precedent for this, Beighton Branch traffic had most commonly aimed at Sheffield or Mottram, with some in early post-war days going further northwest to Gorton, Deansgate and Walton-on-the- Hill, Liverpool. The LD&ECR; Beighton Branch Traditionally the Beighton Branch had two types of freight traffic, coal and through services, usually diversionary or relief traffic off the ex-GCR main line. This latter disappeared when the main line closed, leaving coal, plus small amounts of residual traffic such as the Saturdays Only Wadsley Bridge Batchelors canning factory to Oddicroft Metal Box factory at Sutton-in-Ashfield which ran along the Beighton Branch then the Leen Valley Extension until the former closed as a through route, whereafter it ran via , the new MR-LD&ECR; spur south of Creswell, through the site of then onto the Leen Valley extension right up to the latter's closure on 27 May 1968. Coal remained King, but his domain was shrinking. By the 1960s the Beighton Branch had three working collieries - Westthorpe (near Spinkhill),Westthorpe Colliery in 1978: via flickr CreswellCreswell Colliery in 1978: via flickr and Langwith.Langwith Colliery in 1978: via flickr Coal also arrived on the branch from pits along the Leen Valley Extension and pits east of Langwith Junction, such as Warsop. That, too was changing, closures and rationalisation on the Leen Valley Extension reduced that source. For example, Pleasley Colliery joined underground with Shirebrook Colliery and started sending its coal to the surface via Shirebrook, displacing the railway traffic from ex-GNR to ex-Midland metals, away from the Beighton Branch. Changes in demand also influenced the flow of coal. By the 1960s household coal was in decline and power station coal was on the rise. In 1959, for example, High Marnham Power Station opened and immediately created a new demand in a new location. This was followed in the 1960s by larger new power stations in the Trent Valley whose demand for coal necessitated new technology, which was provided in notable forms such as \\"TOPS\\" and computer timetabled Merry-go-round trains (mgr). West Burton Power Station's power signalbox was opened in 1965, in preparation for stockpiling coal on a wholly different scale from traditional working. West Burton was accessible from Langwith and Creswell collieries via the Beighton Branch, but several factors militated against it: * the route would be circuitous, setting off northwest then turning northeast along the Waleswood Curve to go east to Worksop * the route was steeply graded to the summit at Clowne, and mgr trains were much heavier than anything before * the M1 was being built northwards and would either have to bridge or breach the branch near Barlborough, and * capacity on the alternative route along the ex-MR Nottingham-Worksop route (now the Robin Hood Line) meant this traffic could easily be accommodated. A wholly new connection was built across fields near the Norwood Crossings south of Creswell (not near to or to be confused with Norwood Tunnel or Norwood End No.10 Tunnel, which are near Killamarsh). This enabled coal from pits such as Warsop to travel along the first, easily graded couple of miles of the Beighton Branch then switch east to the ex-MR line and head for Worksop. This opened on 9 January 1967. The Beighton Branch was severed and lifted from that point to the north end of Spinkhill Tunnel. The M1 breached the trackbed near Barlborough and Creswell's coal went out exclusively over ex-Midland metals, with Langwith's following in 1969. Westthorpe's coal went northwards along the remaining northern end of the branch, which was renamed the \\"Westhorpe Colliery Branch\\" and given the Engineer's Code WEC1. This history is traced in the route diagram associated with the Beighton Branch article. The quantities from Westthorpe did not justify retaining the Waleswood Curve, which was also closed on 9 January 1967, so Westthorpe's coal worked along the ex-LD&ECR; to Beighton Junction (1900), immediately across the Old Road via Beighton Junction (1849), northwest along the 1849 MS&LR; Beighton Branch crossing Beighton Junction (1891) in the process, running round in sidings between Woodhouse Junction signalbox and to head off east to Cottam or West Burton. This arrangement lasted until Westthorpe pit closed in 1984, after which point the branch was cut back to a siding. Severing the Beighton Branch led to a re- routing of west to southeast coal traffic from Treeton Colliery which travelled to Rotherwood Sidings then reversed southeast to Woodhouse Junction, Beighton Junction 1849 then Beighton Junction 1900 along the Beighton Branch. That subsequently travelled to Rotherwood and reversed directly along the MS&L; Main Line to , bypassing all Beighton Junctions. It then turned south along the now Robin Hood Line then south east along the new chord to gain its original route. This would have been shorter by the full Beighton Branch, but as it was an mgr train it would have been very demanding uphill to Clowne. The Great Central Main Line The ex-GCR Main Line was severed in 1966. It was subsequently lifted north of Nottingham as far as Duckmanton North Junction. The line from there to Beighton Junction (1891) was retained as a long branch to serve Arkwright Colliery, west of Chesterfield. The detailed and eventful history of the lines serving Arkwright is given the Duckmanton Junction article; as far as Beighton Junction is concerned the Beighton- Arkwright branch was in turn severed in 1982, ending any possibility of revenue earning traffic from the remaining stump through Beighton Junction. The line was duly closed north of Staveley and track from the site of through the site of was lifted in February 1983.Killamarsh History: via killamarsh.org The sidings on both sides of the original Beighton Branch south of the site of Beighton Station were thinned out to leave a single siding, as can be seen in the foreground of the following linked image of a nine coach train headed by a Class 47 heading south towards the 1849 Junction which is behind the camera.GCML Remnant: via signalboxes In due course the siding also disappeared, leaving two plain lines southeast to the 1849 Beighton Junction; this remains the situation in 2013. The Midland Railway \\"Old Road\\" Goods traffic along the Old Road through Beighton Junction 1900 and Beighton Junction 1849 was always frequent, varied and wide-ranging. It is easy for modern observers of Britain's predominantly passenger railway to forget that until the 1950s goods traffic was dominant on the railways. This dominance was exaggerated on the Old Road because the ex-Midland main line split at Tapton Junction north of Chesterfield into the \\"New Road\\" heading northwest to Sheffield and the \\"Old Road\\" heading northeast to Rotherham. Most passenger traffic took the New Road and most freight traffic took the Old Road. The dominance was exaggerated yet further because Beighton Junction lay between the iron and steelmaking areas of Sheffield, Rotherham and Teesside on the one hand and the North Derbyshire coalfield and the iron ore quarries of Northamptonshire on the other. In 1972 Peter Hogarth wrote \\"the 'old road' carries a still considerable volume of freight traffic, running for most of its length through a barren and malodorous wasteland of chemical plants, coking ovens and steel works.\\" From the mid-1950s to the late 1990s British railway goods traffic \\"fell off a cliff.\\" From then up to 2013 it made something of a recovery, albeit from a very low base. Up to the early 1960s the dominant traffic along the Old Road through Beighton Junction was coal and iron ore carried on slow, steam-hauled, loose-coupled trains with corresponding \\"empties\\" in the opposite direction. Mineral traffic was more of a \\"natural traffic\\" for railways than goods in wagon-loads or less where transhipment, marshalling, remarshalling and final transhipment time and costs were prohibitive. The history of freight traffic through Beighton Junction in this period of great change can be summarised in four words: fewer, faster, heavier and further. Iron ore traffic from the Wellingborough area of Northamptonshire along the ex-Midland main line and along the Old Road through Beighton Junction fell away sharply in the 1960s, largely as a result of changes in steel production techniques rendering Northamptonshire ore unsuitable. Although \\"iron concentrate\\" - a substitute for traditional iron ore - began to be produced as a substitute for traditional ore it was sent to the Potteries and not through Beighton. Coal traffic changed in several ways: * sources concentrated onto fewer, larger collieries * trains became predominantly Merry Go Round (\\"mgr\\") block trains * the market shifted towards high-volume power stations, often newly built away from traditional locations, such as the lower Aire and Trent valleys. These trends are described above in the context of the LD&ECR; and apply also to the Old Road. A little-sung use of the Old Road, usually passing straight through Beighton Junction 1849 was for running in and acceptance trials for stock, especially those built or renovated at Derby or Doncaster. Some early HSTs used the route in this way. Other lines Modern times As of 2016, the two lines remain in use for freight and occasional specials and excursions.Pathfinder Tour, 8 June 2013: via sixbellsjunction The \\"Old Road\\" north of here is freight-only, but a number of passenger services use the line from Tapton Junction and the connection to Woodhouse Junction for operational reasons (i.e. train crew route knowledge retention).\\"Passenger Train Services over Unusual Lines 2016 - East Midlands\\" .

Plot Two well-respected football players meet one night in a Hong Kong bar. Roberto is a highly rated striker for a popular team while Football Fa is a star goalkeeper. Over a few drinks, the pair share compliments and, as the evening draws on, their problems. As things turn out, both of these cowardly men have the same major problem: their wives. Roberto's wife Anita constantly nags him and designs outrageous outfits that she insists he wears. Meanwhile, Football Fa is insanely jealous about his beautiful wife Wong Siu-yin and her popularity with his team-mates. Falling into a drunken stupor, both men foolishly agree to get rid of each other's wives. Football Fa seems to have succeeded when he goes to Roberto's house and wakes up thinking he has done the deed. In actual fact, Roberto's wife has left thinking that her husband is with another woman. These two misunderstandings remain hidden though and Football Fa, recovering from the distressing thought of being a murderer, insists that Roberto returns the favour. What follows is an elaborate series of ideas to achieve this dubious goal and get away with it free from blame.

Eddy Merckx, The Cannibal. . Ebury Press, United Kingdom. p.328 It is considered to be one of the most prestigious bicycle brands in the world.

Merckx had retired as a professional rider a little under two years earlier, and he made the manufacturing of high-end road bikes his new professional challenge. Merckx got the idea to build bikes from Ugo De Rosa, who headed the Italian bike manufacturer De Rosa, and who had built bikes for Merckx throughout his career.Fotheringham, William (2012). Half Man, Half Bike. . Yellow Jersey Press, United Kingdom. p.286 Prior to starting his company, Merckx went to Italy, and got trained in the art of making bikes by De Rosa for several weeks. Conversely, Ugo De Rosa visited Eddy Merckx in Belgium to get to know his first employees.Friebe, Daniel (2012). Eddy Merckx, The Cannibal. . Ebury Press, United Kingdom. p.327 Merckx built his factory in what were formerly farm stables in Meise, a small town in the outskirts of Brussels, and went to live in farm house nextdoors. Later, the company moved to the bordering municipality of Zellik, where it remains until today. Among his first employees were some of his former Molteni teammates, the team with which he won three of his five Tour de France victories, three of his five Giro d‚ÄôItalia victories, and two of his three World Championships. Among these employees were Jos Huysmans, Edouard Janssens, and his former team manager, Bob Lelangue.Friebe, Daniel (2012). Eddy Merckx, The Cannibal, . Ebury Press, United Kingdom. p.328 After Merckx‚Äô teammates retired in the recent past, the company has continued the tradition to hire former professional riders to work for the company in the different roles. At first, Merckx specialized in making steel frames, then the industry standard. Later on, he successfully switched over to aluminium and, briefly, titanium. Today, all but one of his bikes are made of carbon fiber, the lightest and stiffest material to make bikes. Eddy Merckx himself has resigned from company management and sold all his shares. The company was owned by Diepensteyn NV from 2014 until June 23, 2017, when Race Productions NV, the owner of Ridley, another Belgian cycle brand, announced the acquisition of Eddy Merckx Cycles.  Heritage  Eddy Merckx‚Äô name quickly became a synonym for one of the most prestigious brands in the cycling world, a reputation it keeps until today. Merckx had always been obsessed with having the best possible bike for his rides. As a rider, he famously adjusted his saddle height during races, stopping over several times in crucial races such as Paris‚ÄìRoubaix or the World Championships, to ensure he would be able to perform at his best.Moore, Richard; Benson, Daniel (2012) The Racing Bicycle: Design, Function, Speed . Universe, US. p.115 And even as manufacturers like Masi, Colnago and De Rosa built the bikes for him and his team, in the 1970s, they already carried Merckx' name due to his involvement in the design of the bikes. Ugo De Rosa said:Moore, Richard; Benson, Daniel (2012): The Racing Bicycle: Design, Function, Speed. . Universe, US. p.135 As a manufacturer, Merckx continued to spend a lot of efforts in the geometry, quality and safety of his bikes. Sam Dansie of Procycling wrote: In 2008, after 28 years of leading the company, Merckx retired from his post as CEO, but continued to instruct his engineers and test the bikes that carried his name: Nowadays, Eddy Merckx engineers are known for making bikes that are stable and reliable at speed. Following the advice from its founder, the company has decided to move away from a focus on only weight, focusing instead on stability of bike and rider:http://www.bikeradar.com/road/news/article/eddy-merckx-cycles-to- investigate-bike-stability--36944/ The fact that Eddy Merckx founded the company still instills a sense of obligation among the company's engineers and mechanics, the company says:Press Release, Eddy Merckx Cycles, July 1, 2013  Current line of bikes  = EMX-525 = The Eddy Merckx EMX-525 is the company's flagship road bike. It is marketed under the slogan ‚Äò‚Äôthe best balanced bike in the world‚Äô‚Äô.http://cycletechreview.com/2013/media/eddy- merckx-emx-525/ Specialists have reviewed it as one of the fastest and most responsive bikes in the world, praising it for its stability, power, and speed.  Main characteristics  The bike has an asymmetrical design, which means the left hand side has a different design and weight distribution than the right hand side. This allows for a better stability of the bike, as the gear system is installed on only one side and needs to be counterbalanced in terms of weight and power. The bike has a higher frame stiffness than other bikes on the market, and incorporates all parts of the bottom bracket inside the frame. This allows for a superior power transmission when the rider puts power in the pedals; all the power a rider puts into the bike goes into the forward movement. Finally, the bike has an oversized and stiff head tube in which the front fork fits completely. This allows for easier turning in corners and on downhills, and is supposed to give the rider more confidence at speed. With the help of Eddy Merckx, the company's head engineer Dave Luyckx said he wanted to build the ultimate racing machine with the currently available technology.Luyckx, Dave (2013) ‚Äò‚ÄôTechnical Brief 525‚Äô‚Äô About the result, he wrote:  Reviews  Bicycling Magazine placed the EMX-525 on the cover of its 2013 buyer's guide and called it uncompromising and very fast.

It has a more relaxed geometry than the EMX-525 to allow for longer, more comfortable rides. It comes with either electronic or mechanical shifting, in Shimano or Campagnolo.  ETT  The ETT is Eddy Merckx' Time Trial and Triathlon bike. It is used by the professional Topsport Vlaanderen- Baloise team in time trials.  EMX-1  The EMX-1 is Eddy Merckx' entry level bike.  AMX-1  The AMX-1 is Eddy Merckx' aluminium bike. It is custom-built in Belgium on demand.  Sponsorship  As from its first year, Eddy Merckx bikes were used by professional riders, a tradition that continues to date. Some of the best professional cycling teams in the 1980s and 1990s rode them.Moore, Richard; Benson, Daniel (2012): The Racing Bicycle: Design, Function, Speed. . Universe, US. p.134 The Marc ‚Äì V.R.D. team of manager Patrick Lefevere rode Eddy Merckx bikes a mere three months after the company was created, and immediately won two le Tour de France stages.http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ploegfiche.php?id=5696 Later, teams like Panasonic, Kelme, 7 Eleven, Telekom, Motorola and Quickstep used Eddy Merckx bikes. Hundreds of professional riders, including former Tour de France winners like Jan Ullrich, green jersey winners like Erik Vanderaerden, Erik Zabel, Robbie McEwen and Tom Boonen and American professionals like Frankie Andreu, Lance Armstrong, Steve Bauer and George Hincapie rode an Eddy Merckx bike at some point in their career.http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ploegfiche.php?id=7783http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ploegfiche.php?id=8026http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ploegfiche.php?id=9129http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ploegfiche.php?id=9151http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ploegfiche.php?id=7282http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ploegfiche.php?id=16330 Today, Eddy Merckx still sponsors three pro cycling teams, including Topsport Vlaanderen-Baloise, a Belgian team for promising young professional cyclists. About the lasting presence of Eddy Merckx in the peloton, Procycling journalist Sam Dansie wrote: In 2019 Eddy Merckx bikes will return to le Tour de France with team AG2R La Mondiale.  Assembly and distribution  Eddy Merckx bikes are assembled in Belgium, and sold through a dealer network in Europe and other export markets. In the US the bikes are also for sale via the company's website.

While many ingredients can trigger a food allergy, this legislation only specifies the eight major food allergens. This law was passed largely due to the efforts of organizations such as the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN). The purpose of this act was to prevent manufacturers from using misleading, uncommon, or confusing methods to label their ingredients. Someone shopping for a friend with a soy allergy might not know that lecithin is derived from soy. Therefore, having an ingredient in a list merely read \\"lecithin\\" is misleading and confusing. Now it must be labeled \\"lecithin (soy)\\" to help prevent consumers making errors.  Eight \\"major\\" food allergens  This law is in regard to the eight most common food allergens. These affect the most people and the proteins are commonly found in other ingredients. They account for about 90% of food allergies. The main eight are: * Milk - A milk allergy is different from lactose intolerance in that the reaction is caused typically by casein, a protein found in milk. * Eggs * Fish * Crustacean shellfish * Tree nuts * Peanuts - Not everyone who is allergic to peanuts is also allergic to tree nuts, or vice versa, as peanuts are actually a legume. * Wheat * Soybeans Any ingredient which contains proteins derived from these allergens must also be listed The specific type of nut, fish, or shellfish must be listed (e.g. walnut, catfish, blue crab) Even minute amounts, such as coloring or spices, must be listed if they contain any proteins from these major allergens. Manufacturers are given two ways in which to label food allergens. They may either state the food source name of a major food allergen in the list of ingredients, most often contained within parenthesis. (e.g. Casein (milk)) or they could instead use the word \\"contains\\" in the label, such as \\"contains peanuts.\\" They can choose either method, as long as it is clearly written. If they choose the second method and say an ingredient \\"contains\\" the allergen, they must be sure to list all allergens contained, such as by saying \\"contains pecans and soy.\\"  References  * H.

Thomas involvement with local farmers‚Äô markets for the last 10 years has enabled him to develop close relationships with various producers in the Bay area. These relationships are very important to him and allow him to be involved in the production of the meat and produce that he uses in all of his restaurants. He has been especially dedicated to CUESA and Outstanding in the Field. Thomas has been nominated three years in a row by the James Beard Foundation for the Rising Star Chef of the Year Award (2011, 2010, 2013).

In 2012, Thomas represented the 1920s in Food & Wine‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmerican Icons at Every Age feature. That same year, Food & Wine Magazine named him one of the 10 ‚ÄòEmpire Builders‚Äô. Early life and career Born in Tabernacle Township, New Jersey to Noble, a nursery owner, and Dorothy McNaughton, a proprietor of Heather Fine Furnishings, Thomas was the youngest of four kids. During his teenage summers, he worked at the Medford Lakes Country Club as a dishwasher and quickly moved up to cook. It was here where he found his passion for the restaurant life and cooking. The energetic and dynamic atmosphere of the kitchen first fascinated him, but as he got older, at around 17 years old, he realized that cooking was definitely what he wanted to pursue. Thomas started attending the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York in 2001. In 2002, he moved to the Bay Area and started working under chef Roland Passot at La Folie. During this year, he cooked classic French food, learned the fundamentals of French cooking and got exposed to the San Francisco restaurant scene for the first time. In 2002, he returned to the Culinary Institute of America and graduated in 2003. He then returned to San Francisco and went on to become sous chef at two of the city's most respected restaurants: Gary Danko and Quince. In addition to his time in San Francisco, Thomas traveled throughout Europe to work and stage at Michel Rostang in France, Tantrise in Germany, and Sassege in Italy. It was during his travels that he developed a passion for the Italian way of cooking. He then went on to apprenticing at Bruno e Franco. in Bologna where he mastered the art of curing meat and pasta making. Restaurants =flour + water= Italian inspired restaurant without turning our backs in California. At the end of his stay in Bologna, Thomas started looking for cooking positions in San Francisco. It is during this time that he embarked in the opening of a new Italian restaurant in the Mission district of San Francisco with partners David White and David Steele. Most of the beginning conceptualization of the restaurant happened over the phone, with White and Steele in San Francisco while Thomas was still in Bologna.http://edge1550.com/podcasts/OnTheMenu-20110109.mp3 The restaurant opened in May 2009. Thomas describes the inspiration behind it as a combination of refinement and old-world technique. Although, the partners were expecting a small opening, flour + water was a widely success from the beginning. The James Beard Foundation nominated flour+water for the Best New Restaurant Award on 2010. In 2011, GQ Magazine named flour+water one of the 10 best restaurants of the year. Since its opening, the restaurant has received multiple accolades in a number of publications, both local and national, including 7x7 (magazine), The San Francisco Chronicle, The Washington Post, The New York Times,http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/travel/27bites.html?ref=travel&_r=0 Food and Wine, Travel + Leisure and others. =central kitchen= Californian cuisine restaurant, \\"Central kitchen\\" After the success of flour+water, Thomas and his partners, David White and David Steele, opened central kitchen on May 2012.

Rubens is among those artists that have succeeded in their work to surmount, for themselves and for us, the limit of human fortuity. To convince us (or \\"fool\\" us) with his gentle artistic \\"caress\\" on the canvas, the velvet layers of delicately selected and coordinated colours that vibrate with the movements of nature, that the search for artistic \\"beauty\\" is still and very much worth our while.

The episode aired on July 1, 2013. Plot Linda tries to keep her emotions intact following Duke's death, after discovering he has left her everything in his will, including his house and savings. Elsewhere, Barbie realizes he left his dog tags at the cabin where he killed Julia‚Äôs husband Peter, and heads back to retrieve them, but is ambushed by Junior who continues to believe Angie is sexually involved with him. At the radio station, Dodee (Jolene Purdy) and Phil (Nicholas Strong) pick up a military frequency, and overhear them discussing the 'dome'. Julia, on a hunt for some answers, commandeers the microphone to broadcast the information. While exploring, Joe and his friend Ben notice that a small part of a stream of water (a hose operated by the military) escapes through the dome. Meanwhile, Big Jim (Dean Norris) has Reverend Coggins (Ned Bellamy) destroy the propane shipment records at Sheriff Duke‚Äôs house, but Coggins accidentally starts a large fire while burning the evidence. Linda hears Coggins yell for help and pulls him out of the house, but the fire spreads when a nearby propane tank explodes, forcing the town to rally together to form a bucket brigade. Though Big Jim had ignored Coggins‚Äô cries for help before anyone arrived on the scene, in front of the town he uses a tractor to contain the fire. The fire is later successfully put out, with the town rejoicing in their efforts to stay strong. Moments later however, a hysterical Deputy Paul (Kevin Sizemore) shoots his gun at the dome, but the bullet ricochets off it and hits Deputy Freddy (Joe Knezevich), killing him. Reception =Ratings= The episode was watched by 11.81 million American viewers with an 18-49 rating/share of 2.9/8. This is down from the pilot episode, but placed first for the night as the most watched and highest rated show. =Critical reception= The episode received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a mixed to negative review, commenting on the lack of character build, saying, \\"Everything character-wise, at this point, is mostly surface level - with everyone pretty much just acting out in panic mode and very little room to go into their back-stories any further. Lost solved this (and I'll try not to keep bringing up Lost) with really well-crafted flashbacks, and although character flashbacks have been done to death on Lost-esque shows (or at least J. J. Abrams produced ones) since then, I feel like some of these folks would benefit from them.\\" Tim Surrette of TV.com gave the episode a negative review, saying, \\"[The] pilot was entertaining, but it did show signs that it wasn't the start of a great series. Junior's kidnapping of Angie, the episode's stress on non-dome side stories, and broadly painted characters really dragged down the second half of the premiere after a pretty solid start.\\" Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a mixed to positive review, saying, \\"This was a solid and world-buildy second outing for Under the Dome. The episode mostly served to further establish the boundaries of the New Dome Order; not much happened until the end, but it seems like the final act will have serious reverberations throughout the town.\\"Franich Darren (July 2, 2013). \\"Under the Dome recap: The Shot Heard Round the Snowglobe\\". Entertainment Weekly. Retrieved April 11, 2014. Andrea Reiher of Zap2it acknowledged the changes from the book and episode, specifically Big Jim's storyline, saying, \\"Big Jim's true nature (true-true nature) is seemingly on a much slow burn for the series. In the book, Big Jim goes from wannabe BMOC to psychopath in fairly short order. The series seems to be making the character more multi-faceted and certainly not as scarily evil as the Rennie of the book. It makes sense‚Äîthe show wants to be on for more than one summer (and it will be, if the ratings continue like they were for the premiere), so the writers can't blow it too early with having Big Jim go from zero to sixty in three episodes. But the slowed down evolution of Big Jim might also bring a lot more sympathy to the character, a change we think could be interesting to watch.\\" References Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Under the Dome episodes ","title":"The Fire (Under the Dome)"},{"id":"39854466","text":"Magic Spells is the third live album from the Brazilian progressive rock band Apocalypse released on Financiarte label.

Stuart and two companies of the 1st Delaware Cavalry shortly before the Battle of Gettysburg. The skirmish, also known as the Battle of Westminster, is thought to have contributed to the delay of Stuart's arrival in Gettysburg and subsequently contributed to the defeat of Confederate forces there. Background Stuart's three brigades of cavalry, after crossing the Potomac River and threatening Washington, D.C., proceeded north toward Pennsylvania, east of the main Confederate army and pursuing Union forces, following loose instructions from Confederate Commander Robert E. Lee. Meanwhile, Companies C and D of the 1st Delaware Cavalry were sent from Baltimore to Westminster to guard the Western Maryland Railway junction and arrived the day before the battle. Battle The Delaware cavalry companies, totaling less than 100 men and commanded by Major Napoleon B. Knight, had arrived unaware of Stuart's impending approach, bivouacked near the northwestern end of town and found the town quiet. The next day, some of the Union troopers decided to have their horses reshod at a stable near the southern end of town. While there, the first Confederate cavalry arrived at the southern end of Westminster and captured those troopers. Major Knight was absent then, so Captain Charles Corbit, one of the company commanders, rallied the remaining troopers and led a cavalry charge down Main Street in Westminster towards Stuart's cavalry, meeting them at the intersection with Washington Road. They were quickly defeated by the Confederates, and Captain Corbit, along with the other company commander, Lieutenant Caleb Churchman, were captured, along with more than half of the other Union troopers. Two were killed and 11 wounded. Two Confederate officers were killed and ten more troopers were wounded. One of the Confederate officers, Lt. John William Murray, Co. E, 4th Virginia cavalry, remains buried in the graveyard of Ascension Episcopal Church. Aftermath The battle prompted Stuart's cavalry to stay the night in Westminster, delaying his arrival at Gettysburg and depriving Gen. Lee of important intelligence about Union troop movements and leading him to commit to fighting at Gettysburg. Commemoration In 2003 the City of Westminster began holding the Commemoration of Corbit's Charge during the last full weekend of June, which has grown into a festival including Civil War re-enactors, demonstrations, museum tours, musical concerts and more.

Psychotic Turnbuckles quickly became a regular attraction on the healthy Sydney live music circuit and shared stages with the likes of The Troggs, the Hitmen, Dark Carnival, Beasts of Bourbon and the Screaming Tribesmen. They were adopted by the Petersham Inn in Sydney's inner-western suburbs as the regular house band and had a bar (The Pismo Bar) named in their honour.

After a year spent researching the newspaper business, she launched The Quoddy Tides with its first issue on November 29, 1968. The newspaper covered communities in \\"the region touched by the tides of Passamaquoddy Bay\\" on both sides of the border between Canada and the United States. For several years the paper's typesetting and paste up were done on the Canadian island of Deer Island. The copy, advertisements and other newspaper contents, and the finished paste ups, were taken from Eastport to Deer Island and back by seasonal ferry in the summer or by fishing boat in the winter. The first edition of The Quoddy Tides appeared late. A note on the paper's front page explained that the editor (Winifred French) \\"had a car accident taking copy to the printer in Blue Hill and now has a broken nose and black and blue eyes\\". Since the first issue, the paper has never been late publishing. Winifred French was named Maine Journalist of the Year in 1979. In 2018 she was inducted into the Maine Press Association Hall of Fame. Winifred French died in 1995 and was succeeded as publisher and editor by her son Edward French. Circulation As of August 2017, circulation was about 5000. In 2019 The Quoddy Tides had subscribers in every American state except South Dakota. Publication The newspaper is owned by Edward French and his siblings. As of 2016 it had six full time staff as well as free lance correspondents in the communities covered, for a total of about 30 contributors. The area covered includes \\"Eastport, Pleasant Point, Perry, Pembroke, Robbinston, Charlotte, Dennysville, Whiting, Lubec, Campobello, Deer Island, Grand Manan and some coverage (and circulation) in Calais and Machias.\\" The newspaper, which has a biweekly dateline, is printed each 2nd and 4th Friday each month and is available on newsstands throughout the Passamaquoddy Bay region. Print subscriptions are mailed nationwide and fully searchable digital archives are available. The paper is printed on the press of The Ellsworth American.

Created in 1929 as a possible replacement for outdated Farman Goliath and improvised Fokker F.VII bombers in use by the Polish Army at the time, it was rejected along all other Polish designs.  History  In early 1920s the Polish Army was seeking home-made \\"retribution bombers\\", that is heavy bombers in modern terminology. However, all proposals by Polish aircraft manufacturers were rejected as none were deemed skilled and experienced enough to build large, complicated bombers. Because of that the newly created 2nd Destroyer Squadron of the 1st Air Regiment in 1926 was equipped with 32 Farman Goliath bombers bought in France. However soon it became clear that the French bomber, designed in 1918, was already obsolete. Furthermore, the Goliaths were seriously underpowered and could not fly on one engine only, a serious flaw in a bomber. Because of that the Department of Air of the Ministry of Military Affairs renewed interest in a home-produced heavy bomber. As a stop-gap solution, the Polish state bought in February 1928 a license for Fokker F.VIIB/3m long-range passenger aircraft to be produced at the Lublin-based Plage i La≈õkiewicz works. By the end of that year Jerzy Rudlicki of Plage i La≈õkiewicz modified the design to build the plane in bomber configuration as well: windows were sealed, the passenger cabin replaced with bomb racks for up to bombs and a single dorsal machine gun nest. The plane, while mechanically sound, was but a stop-gap solution and the Polish Ministry of Military Affairs continued to seek a full-featured replacement for the Goliaths. In 1929 Plage i La≈õkiewicz presented the ministry with a much heavier \\"flying fortress\\" Lublin R-XVIII design, while PWS sent two projects: PWS-22 and PWS-23. Eventually all designs were rejected and the unsuccessful LWS-6 ≈ªubr was chosen as an interim design before the modern PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ could be introduced in the 1930s. The PWS-22 remained a project only.  Technical description  The PWS-22BN3 was a high parasol wing aircraft of mixed construction, with a fixed undercarriage and a crew of either three or four, all seated in open cabins. The wooden wings reinforced with two girders were attached to the fuselage with a pyramid-like mounting. The fuselage was to be made of steel tubes welded together and covered with plywood and canvass. Defensive armament included 5 machine guns, including two in a double nose mount, 2 in dorsal position and 1 in a ventral retractable turret. The bombload was to exceed .

The Apocalypse Hystory. Editora Evangraf, Porto Alegre, 2011. Tracks New Sunrise opens immediately with a barrage of melodic vocals in the chorus, with a modern Yes vibe. Although the band are from Brazil all the vox are English, rather than in Portuguese as some other releases were. Eloy Fritsch's keyboards add a symphonic texture, and there are some dynamic guitars from Ruy Fritsch. The rhythms are usually straight forward, not intricate like Threshold, and they are well performed by Eloy Fritsch on bass and Fabio Schneider on drums. Set me Free continues the symphonic rock style and there is an infectious riff and some labyrinthine passages of keyboard. The vocals again have that Gillan sound, and are easy on the ears, every word is discernible. Take my Heart features the flute playing of Demarchi, that sounds like Ian Anderson hijacked the studio for a few moments. The Angel and Seven Trumpets is a reference to the book of Revelation in the Bible, and it rocks along with a nice tempo. On the Way to the Stars has a scorching lead guitar break from Ruy Fritsch and 'Till Another Side' has a fabulous shimmering organ sound and some delightful acoustics; one of the quietest songs with a melancholy atmosphere. Demarchi's vocals are excellent maintaining a strong high register and always integral to the melodies woven in the tapestry of guitars and keys. Morning Light opens with those Yes like harmonies before the music chimes in with a soaring lead break and very slow tempo. The lyrics in the infectious chorus are effective; \\"Our sun is coming out to shine again, come and take my hand to be free, Morning light, the magic horizon will come, take my hand and we'll be in a dream.\\" Find me Now is a short ballad style song reminding me of Whitesnake, and it is followed by majestic AOR rock style with 'A Cry in the Infinity'. A strange soundwave of a clock chiming, soldiers marching and aeroplanes soaring above, followed by guns and grenades exploding leads to the opening acoustics on To Kiss the Tears You Cry. After such a powerful intro it settles into a melancholy approach, almost sounding like 80s AOR like Survivor or Journey. Ruy's wailing lead break further augments the emotive lyrics; \\"I'm here, close enough to kiss the tears you cry.\\" A child's voice speaks and it leads to an extended coda with a crescendo of guitars and keys, on a fractured time signature. The Gentle Giant-ish a cappella vox harmonies are a nice touch, and the isolated whistling. Blue Angel is a steady melodic rock, gently sung with lyrics that focus on longing for paradise with the blue angle; \\"You show me the paradise, you are my hope, you are my heart, my blue angel.\\" The final track lasts almost 14 minutes, opening with piano runs, and the more progressive time signature on the album. The Hammond organ lines are fast and frenetic, and is reminiscent of Keith Emerson from that band. Indeed, there are references to Tarkus which is surprising after the melodic rock previous. It settles into a mod tempo jazz figure as the vocals enter. Summary 2012 Light Years from Home is no doubt exploring areas not visited previously on other tracks, and it is a breath of fresh air that they have left their most adventurous music till last. It really is designed for headphones and one would gain the full experience if they concentrated on the lyrics as they have a powerful story to tell; one that seems to run as a theme on the album, preparing for the apocalyptic end times. Each song builds up this story and there does not seem to be a happy ending as, after all, not everything turns out like a fairytale. Though the lyrics have an optimistic ray of hope, \\"For you are light inside your dreams, Inside your dreams the sun will lead us, be ready to save the world, our reason to be here, the more we live, the more we learn, the more we fear, the more we lie, the spirit of imagination can lead us through the shadows, so let¬¥s change the world.\\" The symphonic strings and piano are strikingly like Emerson Lake & Palmer's Take a pebble, and then a synth solo like 'Karn Evil 9' enters with staccato Hammond stabs and an irregular synth rhythm. An extended hammering synth sound follows and some of the best keyboard wizardry from Eloy Fritsch.

He graduated with the \\"baccalaur√©at\\" (high school degree) in Latin, Sciences and Mathematics. From 1926 to 1935 he studied at the University of Paris-Sorbonne in Prof. Marcel Guichard's laboratory, earning a doctorate in physical sciences for which he was awarded the Adrian prize of the French Society of Chemistry. In 1938 Gu√©ron was appointed lecturer at the University of Strasbourg. He married Genevi√®ve Bernheim in 1934 and had three sons (Maurice, Henri and Fr√©d√©ric). =World War II= Responding to the historic call for resistance of General Charles de Gaulle, Gu√©ron made his way to Great Britain in June 1940. He enlisted in the Free French Forces and was at first assigned to the Service technique de l'Armement. In December 1941 he was transferred to the Anglo-Canadian Atomic Energy Project, known as \\"Tube Alloys\\", at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge.Detailed uranium chemistry data are collected in a notebook of J. Gu√©ron. This may reflect the knowledge available in 1943 to a foremost expert in the field. In 1943 Gu√©ron moved to Montreal as a member of the Tube Alloys team, which at this point also included the French scientists Halban, Auger, Goldschmidt, and Kowarski. Work at Tube Alloys did not always proceed smoothly. Most notable was a lengthy interruption of the collaboration with the (American) Manhattan project which lasted until the August 1943 Quebec agreement between Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. The French scientists had their own concerns. Some were highly critical of de Gaulle's constant opposition to the United States, and they imagined that he might reconsider if made aware of this specific and significant instance of America's awesome strength. In this spirit, when General de Gaulle visited Ottawa on 11 July 1944, Gu√©ron personally imparted his near certainty that within one year the US would master a highly powerful weapon: \\"une bombe, une ville.\\" =A career in atomic energy= In 1945, the French government established the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) with the charter of exploring atomic energy. Gu√©ron was nominated Head of the Chemistry unit. In 1951 he became the first director of the CEA's nuclear research center in Saclay. In 1958 Gu√©ron was recruited by the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) as General Director of Research and Education (1958‚Äì1968). This may be considered as a draft of a 'History of Euratom' that J. Gu√©ron did not bring to completion. From 1969 to 1976 Gu√©ron was a Professor at the University of Paris-Sud. Concurrently, he consulted for Framatome, the firm responsible for building the vast park of French electricity-producing nuclear reactors. He also served as Secretary of the International Commission on Atomic Weights (1960‚Äì1969). He is the author of several books and of many articles on atomic energy.

Her accounts of the Hadjin siege and Adana massacre provide an important insight into these events. Early life Rose Lambert was born on September 8, 1878, in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, and was the daughter of George and Amanda Lambert. Her father was a minister in the Mennonite Brethren in Christ Church. She graduated from the Deaconess Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, and then became a teacher in Indiana.  Turkish mission  On November 12, 1898, Lambert went to Ottoman Turkey to work among the Armenian orphans of the Hamidian Massacres. She arrived in Hadjin on December 28 and by autumn of 1899 she had 175 orphans under her care. Eventually, two orphanages were opened, one for boys and another for girls. By 1905, the total number of orphans reached 305. Hadjin siege and Adana massacre  Rose Lambert with her father and others at the Hadjin Spring.From left to right are: Henry Maurer, Fredericka Honk, Ida Tschumi, Rose Lambert, and George Lambert. In June 1908, the Ittihad or Young Turks movement overthrew Sultan Abdul Hamid II and declared the return of constitutional rule, promising equality for all citizens of Turkey regardless of religion.Lambert, p. 30. The improved status of Armenians and other Christian groups under the new regime caused alarm among some provincial Turkish leaders, who feared the loss of their relatively privileged position in society.Frey, p. 77. On 13 April 1909, a countercoup occurred and Hamid II was briefly returned to power, but although the countercoup collapsed after only a few days, turmoil continued throughout the country. Rumours that Armenians were planning an insurrectionKerr, p. 7. or that they were committing atrocities against Turks,Lambert, p. 44. spread through the countryside, and shortly after the launch of Hamid's coup, fighting broke out between Turkish and Armenian residents of Adana,Lambert, p. 99. which quickly turned into a massacre of Armenians in the town and surrounding villages. News of killings of Armenians soon reached the neighbouring town of Hadjin, where Lambert was still employed in her missionary work, through telegrams and via a trickle of refugees.Lambert, Chapter IV; p. 44. With the central government unable to restore order in the provinces for several weeks, Hadjin found itself under prolonged siege from armed Turkish villagers--many of them equipped with modern Martini rifles.Lambert, p. 33. Unlike Adana however--a city on a plain with a substantial Armenian minority--Hadjin, as an ethnically homogenous town of some 20,000 Armenians situated high in the mountains, was a much more defensible locality.Lambert, pp. 24‚Äì26. Nonetheless, Hadjin was in a perilous position as its residents were poorly armed and isolated from help, and throughout the siege, they made frantic efforts via telegraph and messenger to enlist aid both from the central government and foreign embassies.Lambert, Chapter V. Matters were further complicated by the fact that the defence of the town was apparently misinterpreted by some in the central government not as a defence but as a rebellion.Lambert, pp. 46‚Äì47, 60. During the siege, Lambert became an important source of news to the outside world, as her reports of the massacres and the plight of the Hadjin Armenians, telegraphed to the American consulate, were published in the New York Times. For example, in one telegram published in the Times on April 23, 1909, Lambert wrote: Norah and Rose Lambert (photograph taken around 1909) A telegram was then sent from Lambert on April 26 and arrived to the United States on April 28. The telegram read in part: Lambert later wrote a book entitled Hadjin and the Armenian Massacres, where she gave a more detailed account of her experiences in Hadjin during the 1909 turmoil. Lambert states that, though fired upon day and night, Hadjin's defenders were instructed not to shoot directly at their attackers unless absolutely necessary, as it was anticipated that the more Turks killed during the defence, the harsher would be retribution from the authorities and the Armenians' Turkish neighbours in the aftermath.Lambert, pp. 77‚Äì78. Lambert also relates how after many attempts to raise the alarm, a regiment of 300 soldiers was despatched from Fekka (Feke) to end the siege, but instead of dispersing the besiegers, the regiment apparently joined them.Lambert, p. 47. Finally, after several weeks, the British consul, who had been informed of the siege by telegraph, was able to organize a relief force of a Turkish regiment led by a reliable officer, which quickly dispersed the besiegers and restored order.Lambert, pp. 66, 78‚Äì81. It was at this point that news of the massacre of up to 30,000 Armenians in the neighbouring locality of Adana reached Hadjin. Lambert wrote:  Aftermath  A street in the Christian quarter of Adana after the massacres (photographed in June 1909) With the siege ended, martial law was established and \\"a number of the principal village Turks were called to give an account of their deeds.\\"Lambert, pp. 81‚Äì82. In their defence, these men testified that they had been driven to violence by false reports of Armenian atrocities and humiliations, and all, according to Lambert, were subsequently pardoned after being given \\"a little advice\\". In contrast with the lenient treatment extended to local Turkish offenders, 70 of the Armenian defenders of Hadjin, including the mayor and his son, city councillors, local defence leaders, and even those who supplied provisions to the defenders including the baker, were imprisoned in harsh conditions awaiting trial, some of them allegedly tortured to extract confessions. While most were released after a few months, several received ten-year jail sentences.Lambert, pp. 83‚Äì84. Lambert's book closes with a number of personal stories related to her by survivors of the massacres. Of particular interest to Lambert was the fate of a number of her associates, including \\"our ministers, delegates, deacons, merchants and the head teacher in our girls' orphanage, numbering seventy-six in all.\\"Lambert, p. 88. According to testimony supplied to Lambert, this group, after falling into the hands of a local Turkish leader, were initially promised protection in return for surrendering all their weapons and other possessions, but on doing so were brutally slaughtered by their captors.Lambert, pp. 88‚Äì90. Lambert concludes her book as follows: To a friend, she wrote: \\"I did my utmost for [the Armenians] and at the time felt it would be much easier to be with the martyrs than to live with the memories of the atrocities.\\" Later life Lambert returned to the United States in 1910, and married Texas rancher David Musselman the following year, on October 4, 1911. They had five children, David, George, Paul, Rose and John. Rose Lambert Musselmann died in 1974 at the age of 96 and is buried at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Victoria County, Texas. Legacy In H.

He has been Minister of State in Bisher Al- Khasawneh's government since 12 October 2020. Previously he was a member of the House of Representatives in the 12th through 17th parliaments. He served multiple terms as Head of House Legal Committee. Political career In 1999 he opposed amending Article 340 of the law, which lessened the punishment or exonerated those who killed family members for harming family honor. In October 2007, he once more said that it will take a long time for Jordanian society to change its attitude towards honour killings. While in his position of Head of House Legal Committee in early 2000, Kharabsheh accused Issams al- Rawabdeh, the son of Jordanian Prime Minister Abdelraouf al-Rawabdeh, of corruption. After the charges al-Rawabdeh shuffled his cabinet, the move was seen as a way to lessen criticism against himself. After a new parliament was elected in 2003, several temporary laws were up for review. Two of those were related to women's rights: Article 340 called for the same reduction of punishment for women as perpetrator in honour killings, and the Khuloe law gave women the right to file for divorce without giving a reason in return for her wedding dowry. Kharabsheh said he would vote against the Khuloe law as he saw it to be in contradiction of the sharia law. He also said that \\"women would destroy the family if divorce was in their hands\\". In June 2009 he called for the resignation of Omar Rimawi, President of Al-Balqa\` Applied University, for his involvement in financial and administrative corruption. Shortly thereafter Mahmud's nephew Atef al-Kharabsha was appointed as advisor to Rimawi. In January 2012 Kharabsheh was against nuclear power as a source for Jordan's energy. He cited high costs and lower than expected uranium supplies as the main problems for the construction of a nuclear energy plant. In March 2012 he claimed that the proposed Jordans 2012 Passports Law violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

After the British victory in the Second Boer War, movements began to unify and consolidate British holdings in Southern Africa. The 1903 Customs Union Agreement was signed by the parties to the Agreement over the course of a month in several different locations. The dates on which it was signed were 6, 12, and 25 May and 3 June 1903, and signings took place in Johannesburg, Pietermaritzburg, Douglas, and Salisbury. The Agreement was signed by the governments of the Cape Colony, the Colony of Natal, the Orange River Colony, the Transvaal Colony, and Southern Rhodesia. The Governor of the Cape Colony, who was the High Commissioner for Southern Africa, also signed on behalf of Basutoland and the Bechuanaland Protectorate. Swaziland was admitted to the union in a supplementary protocol that was agreed to in 1904, while North-western Rhodesia was admitted in 1905. The Agreement established a customs union area with free trade amongst the parties. The success of the customs union encouraged some British residents to seek political unification, which ultimately resulted in the creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910. (Basutoland, Southern Rhodesia, and Swaziland did not join the political union.) In 1910, the Southern African Customs Union was created as the successor to the 1903 union; however, Southern Rhodesia did not join the 1910 customs union.

Unlike most other spring rolls, its wrapper is made from rice ...Vu Hong Lien - Rice and Baguette: A History of Food in Vietnam 2016 - 1780237049 To wrap the rolls, spread a ricepaper wrapper on a flat surface and wipe it with a wet cloth to moisten. Spoon the mixture on to the ... Another type of roll is equally popular, called ch·∫£ gi√≤ in the south and nem r√°n in the north. It is a Vietnamese ... Ingredients Nem r√°n (Northern style) The main structure of a roll of ch·∫£ gi√≤ is commonly seasoned ground meat, mushrooms, noodles, and diced vegetables such as carrots, kohlrabi and jicama, rolled up in a sheet of moist rice paper . The roll is then deep fried until the rice paper coat turns crispy and golden brown. The ingredients, however, are not fixed. The most commonly used meat is pork, but one can also use crab, shrimp, chicken, and sometimes snails (in northern Vietnam), and tofu (for vegetarian ch·∫£ gi√≤- 'ch·∫£ gi√≤ chay'). If diced carrots and jicama are used, the stuffing is a little bit crunchy, matching the crispy fried rice paper, but the juice from these vegetables can cause the rolls to soften after a short time. If the rolls are to be stored for a long time, mashed sweet potato or mung beans may be used instead to keep the rolls crispy. One may also include bean sprouts and rice vermicelli. Eggs and various spices can be added to one's preference. Sometimes, the ingredients can include julienned taro root and carrots if jicama cannot be found. Taro roots give it a fatty and crunchy taste. Ch·∫£ gi√≤ r·∫ø Ch·∫£ gi√≤ r·∫ø is an uncommon kind of ch·∫£ gi√≤ (nem) that uses b√°nh h·ªèi (thin rice vermicelli woven into a sheet) instead of rice paper. The stuffing inside the roll is the same as normal ch·∫£ gi√≤, and the roll is also deep fried. The sheets of b√°nh h·ªèi are narrow, and the rice vermicelli strands are brittle, ch·∫£ gi√≤ r·∫ø rolls are often small and difficult to make. They are only seen at large parties and restaurants. Ch·∫£ gi√≤ (Vietnamese Spring Rolls) at World Heritage Cuisine Summit & Food Festival 2018 The most interesting part in nem recipe is that it varies on different families and also different regions of Vietnam. No recipe is official. It depends on the custom of eating of each family. Therefore, in some ways the ch·∫£ gi√≤ made by the wives show their cares for their own family. Condiments Ch·∫£ gi√≤ can be eaten by itself, dipped into n∆∞·ªõc ch·∫•m or n∆∞·ªõc m·∫Øm pha (fish sauce mixed with lemon juice or vinegar, water, sugar, garlic and chili pepper), or served with rice vermicelli (in b√∫n ch·∫£ gi√≤). Usually it is served with a dish of rau s·ªëng ( raw vegetable) containing several kinds of vegetable such as lettuce, coriander, etc. It is very common to wrap the ch·∫£ gi√≤ in lettuce before eating it. Confusion with other varieties of rolls There can often be confusion as to what exactly is meant by nem depending on the circumstances. In Vietnam, there can be confusion between northerners and southerners because northerners tend to use the term nem to refer to a variety of different rice paper rolls containing meat, including g·ªèi cu·ªën, which Northerners call nem cu·ªën (often referred to in western restaurants as \\"salad rolls\\"). The southerners, however, tend to adopt a more precise definition of nem, using the word nem to only refer to ground meat food items like nem n∆∞·ªõng (literally \\"grilled sausage\\", a minced pork sausage mixed infused with crushed garlic and fish sauce and then grilled). Further confusion can occur outside of Vietnam because the English translation of ch·∫£ gi√≤ varies according to restaurants' menus, ch·∫£ gi√≤ is often confused with other dishes such as egg rolls or salad rolls. As ch·∫£ gi√≤ made with rice paper can easily be shattered when fried, and also stay crispy for only a few hours, restaurants outside of Vietnam have adopted wheat flour sheet to make ch·∫£ gi√≤, in place of rice paper, thus blurring the difference between ch·∫£ gi√≤ and the Chinese egg roll.

In 1898, Boal returned to the United States and established an office in the Equitable Building in Denver. He designed the Ferguson House, which was completed in 1899.

New England Women's Hockey Alliance (NEWHA)  The newest conference to receive NCAA Division I recognition in ice hockey is the New England Women's Hockey Alliance. The NEWHA formed in 2017 as a scheduling alliance between the sport's six then-existing National Collegiate (Division I/II) independents, all located in New England. Of these schools, Sacred Heart was the only one that played at the National Collegiate level before 2017, having competed as an independent since 2003. The other five charter members, which all began National Collegiate play in 2017, consisted of one Division I member (Holy Cross) and four Division II members (Franklin Pierce, Post, Saint Anselm, Saint Michael's). Holy Cross left after the first NEWHA season of 2017‚Äì18 to join Hockey East. Shortly before the 2018‚Äì19 season, the remaining five members formally organized as a conference and began the process of gaining full NCAA recognition. In the meantime, LIU Brooklyn had announced that it would add women's ice hockey effective in 2019‚Äì20, and would join the NEWHA at that time. Shortly after this announcement, the school's parent institution, Long Island University, announced that it would merge the athletic programs of its two main campuses (Division I Brooklyn and Division II Post) into a single Division I program that would later be unveiled as the LIU Sharks. With the conference membership returning to six for 2019‚Äì20, the NCAA officially approved the NEWHA as a Division I conference shortly before the start of that season. This action also meant that there would be no independent programs in that season, since the NEWHA membership included all of the previous National Collegiate independents.

Moeser case was a result of a summer reading program for new students implemented by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2002 that was objected to by several groups and was referred to by the media as the UNC-Qur'an Controversy. Controversy Professor Carl W. Ernst of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) was asked if there was a good translation of the Qur'an that would be suitable for its Summer reading program of 2002. The program amounts to reading a short book, writing a short paper, and participating in small group discussion for two hours. He suggested Ernst noted that if it were not available he couldn't recommend one for the program. The book was adopted and the program set. On May 21, 2002, conservative commentator Brit Hume of Foxnews released the first known news story on the forthcoming program followed by NPR on May 29. Early responses from parents directly to the university were generally negative though others said it was a courageous choice. Initially the ACLU and conservative commentators were concerned that a favoritism in religion was being shown. The then Chancellor of UNC, James Moeser, began to appear in various news outlets reporting some of the negative feedback his office had received but supporting the program noting most of the incoming students were assumed to be Christian or Jewish with a comparative lack of understanding Islam and that part of the mission of the university, its \\"great function\\", was to help expand understanding of other cultures. In July The O'Reilly Factor covered the controversy followed in August the television shows Good Morning America and Nightline as the time of the reading program approached. Public talking points included whether the effort respected the suffering in light of September 11 attacks or that was an initial approach to the subject of Islam, a natural subject for review in light of 9-11. Under pressure, the university changed the implementation of the program for the incoming class of 4,200 freshmen and transfer students by asking those who objected to reading the book to write a one-page essay explaining their reasons. Ultimately 2,260 freshmen took part on August 19 (after a court case ruled in favor of the university) in some 160 small group discussions led by one or more of 178 faculty and staff. Significant news coverage began in July and continued through November 2002, while further analysis and recall of the experience continue to be published. Legal challenges A conservative-Christian activist group, the Family Policy Network, filed suit in the U.S. District Court, Middle District of North Carolina, on July 22, 2002, representing several students who were allowed to remain anonymous seeking a preliminary injunction to keep UNC from conducting its summer program, alleging that it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and abridged students' rights to free exercise of religion by obliging them to study Islam against their will. The case was entitled Yacovelli v. Moeser (after James Yacovelli, a Family Policy Network spokesman, and James Moeser, the UNC Chancellor). The plaintiffs also asserted that the university through choosing Michael Sells book had misrepresented Islam by not by focusing on its more controversial elements. The university countered that the implementation of allowing students who objected to the reading were allowed to submit a single page report with their reasoning and thereby opt out of reading the book, but still participate in the discussions, insured that there was no violation of the Constitution and sought to continue with the program. The court ruled in favor of UNC, and Family Policy Network appealed to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, [Yacovelli v. Moeser, Aff'd, Case No. 02-1889, (4th Cir., Aug. 19, 2002)] but lost again. Between the case and its first appeal North Carolina state government representative J. Sam Ellis was among those that sought to limit funding for the summer reading program when on August 7 the House Appropriations Committee voted to bar public funds for use in UNC's 2002 summer reading program, unless \\"all known religions are given equal treatment.\\" This proviso was removed when the state budget finally passed in mid-September. The overall conclusion of Chief Judge N. Carlton Tilley, Jr., was that the book was strictly academic, not religious in nature, and therefore did not amount to a religious activity despite claims that listening to the CD exposes students to \\"the spell cast by a holy man of Islam\\" for example. The judge ended his analysis with an application of the \\"Lemon test\\" deriving from the Lemon vs. Kurtzman court case. Chief Judge Tilley said: > Approaching the Qur'an\\" simply cannot be compared to religious practices > that have been deemed violative of the \\"Establishment Clause\\", such as > posting the Ten Commandments, reading the Lord's Prayer, or reciting prayers > in school. The book does include surahs, which are similar to Christian > Psalms. However, by his own words, the author endeavors only to explain > Islam and not to endorse it. Furthermore, listening to Islamic prayers in an > effort to understand the artistic nature of the readings and its connection > to a historical religious text does not have the primary effect of advancing > religion. The university's lawyers observed that the U.S. Supreme Court endorsed the academic study of religion in public schools and universities when Justice Tom C. Clark in 1963 declared, \\"one's education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization.\\" Based on this as it applies to the Qur'an specifically, university officials then argued that, in addition to being constitutionally permissible, one's education is not complete without a study of the Qur'an (as well as the history of Islam) and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. A revised challenge by the American Family Association's Center for Law and Policy, who had represented FPN all along, was filed in 2004, [Yacovelli v. Moeser, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9152, (M.D.N.C. May 20, 2004)] which also lost on appeal, [Motion granted by, dismissed by Yacovelli v. Moeser, 324 F. Supp. 2d 760, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12815 (M.D.N.C., July 7, 2004)] addressed various challenges of presenting material online related to the program by ruling it was in fact just focused on presenting the program rather than religious instruction. Media UNC's own count of news coverage includes some 41 days, with some days having many news stories ‚Äì for example, August 28 has 31 instances of coverage. On August 27, C-SPAN covered Chancellor Moeser's speech at the National Press Club. He noted many of the objections his office had received.

He was born in Bavaria, in either the towns of Scheinfeld, Nuremberg, or Albertkunstadt, and on April 8, between 1818 and 1820. Career Lankershim settled in St. Louis, Missouri and worked in the grain and livestock shipping business. In 1854, Lankershim moved west to the Napa Valley in California. A year later, in 1855, he sowed and harvested 1,000 acres of wheat in Solano County, California. Shortly after, he expanded to over 14,000 acres near Fresno, California. In 1868, he purchased a bigger ranch in San Diego, California and grew wheat. In 1860, the rest of his family moved from St. Louis to California, and he established an office in San Francisco, California. In the late 1860s, Lankershim moved to Los Angeles, California, where he became associated with businessman Harris Newmark. In 1869, Lankershim purchased 60,000 acres of the San Fernando Valley from Pio Pico \\"Lankershim's renewed vitality in areas like the NoHo Arts District reflects mass transit's ascent\\" (22 Dec 2012) Los Angeles Times for US$115,000 together with other businessmen from San Francisco, known as the San Fernando Valley Farm Homestead Association.Cecilia Rasmussen, \\"A possible romance led to lawsuit, death\\" (Dec. 2, 2007) The Los Angeles TimesJoann Deutch, \\"The Tale Of Notable Dead Lankershim\\" (April 25, 2009) Canyon News These acres included what is now Woodland Hills, Tarzana, Encino, Sherman Oaks, Van Nuys and North Hollywood. By 1873, they raised 40,000 sheep on the ranch. When wool prices fell, they grew wheat instead. To take the wheat from the valley to Santa Monica, California, he built a wagon path now known as Interstate 405. In 1876, he turned it into a toll road. With his son-in-law, Isaac Newton Van Nuys, Lankershim started the Los Angeles Farming and Milling Co, and they took over full ownership of the San Fernando Valley Ranch Company. They also established the Lankershim Ranch Land & Water Co., a 12,000-acre real estate development in what is now known as North Hollywood, Los Angeles. Personal life, death and legacy Lankershim married Annis Lydia Moore (1818‚Äì1901), an English immigrant in 1842. He relinquished his Jewish faith and converted to the Baptist faith. They had a son, James Boon Lankershim (1850‚Äì1931), and a daughter, Susanna Lankershim, who married Isaac Newton Van Nuys (1836‚Äì1912). He died on April 10, 1882.

The network's resident screenwriter, Denoy Navarro-Punio conceptualized and developed the story which tells of \\"a woman born out of wedlock, and who, amidst adversaries, gets back on her feet to claim the life and love she deserves.\\" The network's drama department hired seasoned actress and director, Laurice Guillen to helm the series. In an interview, when asked what got her to accepting an assignment she, in the past, had dodged (she appeared on several television series as an actor, but she wouldn't dip her fingers into it as a director), Guillen admitted that \\"the offer was good, plus more.\\" The network [for one], accommodated certain requests pertaining to shooting schedules given her aversion to taping long hours or till the \\"wee\\" hours of the morning. As to the actors she assembled for the series, Guillen said she was glad that most, if not all, of them are competent performers and \\"they are the best cast possible in terms of talent and professionalism\\". She's also very happy with the story, with the writers and creative team, and the network support. Apart from that, Guillen also stated her more personal reasons for saying \\"yes\\", said that \\"I told myself, when will I do something like this? [...] I'm not getting any younger, and when I am no longer physically capable of directing one, I don't want to regret that I didn't do it, at least once.\\" Production began in June 2013. Most of the series' were shot on location in Tagaytay. Other locations include Antipolo, Quiapo and San Juan, Manila. The official cast photos, logo and teasers were released on July 2013, while its first-look trailer was released on September 5. The premiere was planned for July 29, but because of some unexpected production-related problems, delayed until September 9, 2013. The show is originally slated to run for sixteen weeks. However, in an interview (Business World, dated November 18, 2013), Poe revealed that the series has been extended for another five weeks \\"after gaining a strong following since it debuted in September.\\" =Casting= The network began casting for Akin Pa Rin ang Bukas in May 2013. The first actor to be cast was Lovi Poe as the lead protagonist Lovelia Villacorta, followed by Rocco Nacino as Jerry, the love interest. After the first sit down meeting with creative director Jun Lana, Cesar Montano immediately agreed to star on the series. Montano also stated that it was his desire to work again with director, Laurice Guillen‚Äîwho was his director in the 1989 film Ang Bukas ay Akin, which he won his very first acting award‚Äîas one of the main reasons why he accepted the project. The network also announced the inclusion of Solenn Heussaff, Gary Estrada and Charee Pineda as series regulars. The role of Jade Carmelo was originally offered to Alessandra de Rossi but she turned it down, and so it was given to Heussaff. Estrada signed on to portray Roel Villacorta, while Pineda was cast as the main villain Agatha Morales. After signing an exclusive contract with the network, veteran actress Helen Gamboa was cast as Beatrice Villacorta in the project. However, she had to drop out of the series for \\"health reasons\\". Gamboa had already finished twenty-two sequences in different locations, so the production had to re-shoot all her scenes. Liza Lorena who was originally tapped to play another important role in the series, was asked to replace Gamboa. On the other hand, veteran actress, Gloria Romero, took the original role of Liza Lorena as Cristina Alperos, stated that she was hesitant to accept the said role when it was first offered to her. But after a meeting with the production people regarding the concept, story line, her character and \\"when they told me that the director will be Laurice Guillen, I immediately grabbed the project.\\" =Music= The song \\"Huwag Kang Mangako\\" performed by Lovi Poe was used as the theme song of the show. The song was composed by Cecille Azarcon and it was first sung by Kuh Ledesma in 1990 as part of her album Lihim released by Blackgold Records. Pearisha Abubakar composed for the show. Reception =Ratings= According to AGB Nielsen Philippines' Mega Manila household television ratings, the pilot episode of Akin Pa Rin ang Bukas earned a 25.2% rating. While the final episode scored a 25% rating. =Critical response= Journal's resident entertainment columnist, Mario Bautista commented on Rocco Nacino's acting performances, saying that \\"[Nacino is] fascinating to watch in Akin Pa rin ang Bukas because he obviously understands his role well. As the scheming and double dealing Jerry, he is a young man from squatters who try to make it appear in front of Lovi Poe as Lovelia that he is rich and cultured. When he's at home with the squatters, he really acts like a regular uncouth 'sanggan'. But when he's with Lovi and Cesar Montano, he speaks in English and delivers lines he quotes from the Hollywood movies he watches and imitates. In his reviews, Isah Red of Manila Standard Today, praised Poe as she \\"continues to amaze the audience with her nearly naturalistic performance as a woman who is struggling between death and love.\\" Red also praised series' director Laurice Guillen, said that \\"[Guillen] is meticulous in making sure that it does not develop into a nonsensical melodrama in which the plot meanders repetitiously. And I am glad its storyline goes into the direction in which we discover a lot about the characters.\\" References External links * Category:2013 Philippine television series debuts Category:2013 Philippine television series endings Category:Filipino-language television shows Category:GMA Network drama series Category:Television shows set in the Philippines ","title":"Akin Pa Rin ang Bukas"},{"id":"39855788","text":"Danebod (pronounced \\"DAHN-a-bo\\", or \\"DAN-a-bo\\") is a historic district at the south edge of the railway town of Tyler in southwestern Minnesota. Founded in 1885 by Danish Evangelical Lutherans led by Rev. Hans J√∏rgen Pedersen (1851‚Äì1905), the district comprises a group of buildings dating back to 1888 from Minnesota's oldest Danish immigrant settlement. Danebod remains until this day a predominantly Danish Lutheran, close-knit religious community. An annual celebration named √Übleskiver Days, held on the fourth weekend of July, celebrates Danish heritage and culture and includes a parade that goes down the town's main street with floats that are made by the various Danebod neighborhoods. On the basis of its cultural and architectural significance, four buildings from Danebod were added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 30, 1975 as the \\"Danebod Historic Complex\\".  Etymology  The area was named Danebod in honor of Queen Thyra Danebod of Denmark. The name \\"Danebod\\" honors Denmark's first queen, Queen Thyra Danebod, the consort of tenth-century Danish king Gorm the Old. Queen Thyra is thought to have directed the building of a stone wall across the Danish peninsula of Jutland as protection against foes to the south, and in gratitude she was given the name Danebod. The name Danebod originally meant in Danish \\"one who mends, comforts, or saves the Danes\\".  History  The native inhabitants of the area which later became Danebod were the Dakota Sioux people. = Establishment = Danebod was established by Grundtvigians, followers of Nikolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig (1783‚Äì1872). On September 8, 1872, two Danish pioneer pastors, Adam Dan and Rasmus Andersen, established a small organization in Neenah, Wisconsin, which later became the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. At one of the churches' conventions in Clinton, Iowa, in 1884, the Danish farmer Rasmus Hansen of Elk Horn, Iowa, suggested that \\"the Danish Church should help all the families living around in cities, who would prefer living in the countryside, where they could find a fitting spot for a Danish colony.\\" A committee was appointed for the purpose of finding a piece of land for the scattered Danish immigrants to settle. The committee consisted of the Grundtvigian Evangelical-Lutheran pastors F. L. Grundtvig (the son of N. F. S. Grundtvig), Kristian Anker, Rasmus Hansen, Jens C. Kj√¶r, and C. Bruhn. This committee soon made arrangements with Winona and the St. Peter Railroad Company to purchase of land in the southeastern part of Lincoln County, Minnesota. An agreement with the land agent, A. Bojsen, stipulated that for three years this land was to be sold only to Danish people. The land was rolling prairie by the hills of Buffalo Ridge, just south of the community of Tyler, Minnesota. By June 27, 1885, seventy settlers from various states, towns, and communities had made the area their home. The pioneer settlers were all Grundtvigians; a faction within the Danish National Church. The Grundtvigians represented a nationalistic and liberal religious tradition, in staunch contrast to pietists and fundamentalists in the Church Association for the Inner Mission in Denmark. Grundtvigians believed in celebrating life, but they lived for the present, and were often nicknamed \\"Happy Danes\\". While salvation was the gift of Christianity, being saved was not a focus. The Bible was the Holy Book, but was not to be taken literally, and the Apostles' Creed rather than the Bible was their source of Christianity. Grundtvigians were also nationalists who wanted to \\"rewaken the Danes in appreciation of their identity\\", and its founder, Nikolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig, is quoted for his writing: \\"first a Dane and then a Christian\\" in 1848. The Grundtvigians stressed four elects of a \\"true people\\": a common land, a common language, a common history and forefathers, and common culture through songs, folk dancing, language, cuisine, etc. Grundtvigians established Danebod to \\"save the Danes from total Americanization\\", and the colony's only written and spoken language remained Danish for several decades after its establishment. On Sunday, June 28, 1885, the pioneers arranged a festival to celebrate the new colony. The population grew rapidly in the early 1890s, and by the year 1895, 222 people lived in the Danish Colony of Danebod. = Late 19th century = Monument to \\"Borneskolen\\" residential school, founded by early settlers of the colony in the Danish tradition of folk high schools, fostering the concept of learning for living. On July 11, 1886, a meeting was held at the home of P. N. Clausen at which the Danebod congregation was formally organized with fifteen members. The church council consisted of its president, P. N. Clausen, secretary M. Lauritsen, and treasurer J√∏rgen Jacobsen. At first there were no regular church services and no resident pastor. Instead, the people met in various homes to sing Danish hymns and listen to a reading of the sermon by a layman. The pastor of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, S. C. Madsen, and other ministers occasionally conducted services in town. The congregation later hired the Danish settler, pastor Hans J√∏rgen Pedersen (1851‚Äì1905) of Gowen, Michigan. He arrived with his family on April 12, 1888. Pedersen had a humble upbringing in Denmark, where he later studied at Ryslinge Folk High School before emigrating to America in 1875. He was an eloquent preacher, resourceful, and became involved in community activities throughout the area. He quickly assumed leadership and thus, in a sense, became the founder of Danebod. One of the pastor's six children, Sigurd Pedersen, described their first arrival in Danebod in his autobiography: \\"It was a chilly morning, when the committee stood on the platform to bid welcome to the new pastor and his wife, trailed by six children, and the rear held up by the trusty hired man, S√∏ren Olsen, who was to keep count of the straying flock and see that the last luggage was not forgotten. Friends invited us over for breakfast in the home of H. J. Nelsen, the merchant. Then the committee guided us to a small house on the corner just west of the present-day Chevrolet dealer, where businessman Carl Cold Sorensen brought the first automobiles to the area in the early 1900s. The committee had left no kindling in this small house, but S√∏ren Olsen soon discovered that the kitchen range was in place and claimed to be able to manipulate the same if kindling could be provided. Across the street was a large general store, and father sent us there to beg Mr. Lauritsen for some kindling. We were given old boxes to break up, and we soon had our arms full and S√∏ren had a blazing fire in a few minutes.\\" In September 1888, it was decided at a convention in Elk Horn, Iowa, to give the congregation at Danebod of land, and the Danebod Lutheran Church was dedicated on Sunday, June 16, 1895. Pedersen died in 1905, and the Reverend Thorvald Knudsen succeeded him at Danebod. Danebod Stone Hall was built in 1889 from native field rock hauled in by farmers and split and shaped by Danish stonemason Kristian Klink. Pastor H. J. Pedersen, like most early pastors in the synod, had received his training in a folk school, and he was convinced that the success of the new congregation and colony depended on the establishment of such a Danish-speaking folk school. Danebod Folk School opened December 1, 1888, with Pedersen as president. Other teachers were Carl Hansen and Christian Hansen. Among the first students were Niels Petersen and Kristian Klink, both Danish immigrants. Klink was a stonemason educated in Denmark, and he helped pastor Pedersen in building the Stone Hall. It was built of native rock. Farmers hauled rocks from the shores of Swan Lake just south of Danebod, and Klink and his helpers split and shaped the rocks. The Stone Hall was finished in the fall of 1889, and the first public gathering in the Stone Hall was at Klink's funeral in November 1889. The Stone Hall quickly became the center of the new colony, and Sunday services were conducted here, as well as numerous weddings, baptisms and funerals. The students at the Danebod Folk School used the building as a gym hall, and young people would meet here to socialize, meet up with friends, and participate in singing games. Three years later, the Stone Hall was now too small for worship services. It was decided to build a new church, and the Cross Church at Danebod was dedicated on Sunday, June 16, 1895. = Early 20th century = In the fall of 1898, a committee was elected to gather money for purchasing a church bell. The bell was hung two years later, and it rang for the first time on Sunday, November 25, 1900. A Ladies' Aid society was established on July 15, 1903, with board members Marie Hovgaard, Anna P. C. Petersen, Henrietta Hansen, and Sine C. Jensen. At first, Sunday school was conducted an hour prior to the church services on Sunday, but in 1907 it was decided to hold Sunday school during the time of worship service. As early as 1904, the synod had discussed the possibility of establishing a children's home at Tyler. On November 1, 1906, a children's home opened in the residence of K. H. Duus, who temporarily moved to Askov, Minnesota. A Folk School Association was organized in 1912. As early as 1888, the colony organized its first Danish elementary school for its children, B√∏rneskolen, which was in use until 1939. In her travel diary entitled My Big Adventure of 1915‚Äì1916: The joys and hazards of motor touring in 1915, Danebod local Ragna C. Olson (1905‚Äì2007) described the average school day in 1914: \\"We had an hour of religion, then learned how to read and write Danish, some history, and the last hour we girls learned work such as knitting, crocheting and embroidery. In the afternoons, they taught us English, writing, reading and arithmetic.\\" Ragna Olsen (previously Sorensen) was the daughter of the Danish pioneers Johanne Marie Sorensen (1877‚Äì1947) and Carl Cold Sorensen (1879‚Äì1967), both of whom hold a place in Danebod history for bringing the first motorized vehicles to Tyler in the early 1900s. On Sunday, February 25, 1917, Danebod Folk School burned to the ground. Fortunately, the fire burned slowly. The students and the quickly summoned neighbors had time to rescue much of the furniture and other items of high value. Nearby buildings were saved, but the Folk School was beyond rescue. In the fall of 1917, nine months after the disastrous fire, a new and larger Folk School was dedicated. Speakers at the dedicatory exercises were Pastor Knudsen, C. P. H√∏jbjerg, Aage M√∏ller, P. Rasmussen, and Kristian √òstergaard. Meanwhile, a terrible epidemic of influenza swept the county, and all churches and schools were temporarily closed in an effort to halt the deadly disease; but many people died. Another catastrophe followed on August 21, 1918, when a devastating tornado tore through Lincoln County. It was the fourth most deadly tornado in Minnesota history and took the lives of 36 people and injured a dozen more.  Culture  Danebod Community Center during √Übleskiver Days, 2007 Danebod has continued to be a haven for Danish culture through the 20th century and into the 21st. The elementary school, university, library, newspapers, and church services remained Danish language for decades (and remained the most widely spoken language until the 1940s). Danebod remains a predominantly Danish-American town. It is customary to fly the Danish flag, Dannebrog, and Danish cuisine, music, cultural celebrations, language, literature, and the Evangelical Lutheran religious tradition remain important parts of life for the more than 200 inhabitants. Until 1947 church services were held solely in the Danish language, but has since offered one weekly service in Danish. Danebod is sometimes referred to as \\"the home of the Nissem√¶nd,\\" a reference to the mythological tomte of folklore.Paprock, John- Brian and Teresa Peneguy (2004). Sacred Sites of Minnesota. Big Earth Publishing. Page 87. . There is a sign on Tyler Street saying: \\"Welcome to Tyler. Home of the Nissemaend\\". During the 1930s, a combination of financial pressure and low enrollment forced the Danish-language based Danebod Folk School to close down. The building was re-opened in 1946 and has since 1947 offered annual summer family camps. Danebod Folk Camp offers Danish cuisine, Danish folk dance, Danish art, and other Danish cultural experiences. In the spirit of the Danish Folk School system, camp attendees sing Danish songs, dance traditional Danish folk dance, work on crafts and have Danish-based lectures throughout the day. There are several annual Danish-inspired celebrations in town, including the town parade, Grundlovsdag (Danish Constitution Day), Fastelavn, and √Übleskiver Days. √Übleskiver are traditional Danish pancakes in a distinctive spherical shape. √Übleskiver Days is one of the town's top attractions, and has been held annually by Danish descendants for more than a hundred years. During this two-day festival held on the 4th weekend of every July, Danebod celebrates its Danish heritage and community. During this festival, there is a parade inspired by Danish traditions and culture that goes down Main Street with floats made by the various neighborhoods. Traditional Danish foods such as medisterp√∏lse, frikadeller, rabarbergr√∏d, r√∏dk√•l, cream wafers, cinnamon sticks, rosettes, kisses, as well as √¶bleskiver, sm√∏rrebr√∏d, Danish coffee, liver-p√¢t√©, and sweets are also popular during the festival. Other activities during √Übleskiver Days include traditional Danish folk dancing, Danish art displays, Danish folk song singing, children's activities, and the fairground fair called Tivoli The Scandinavian tradition of singing and dancing around the Christmas tree still takes place at the center of the Gym Hall during Christmas time.Minnesota Society (2005). Architecture Minnesota, Volume 31. Bill Dorn Associates, Incorporated. Page 62. Some families keep up the tradition of celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24\\\\. There is a town fair on the Danish Constitution Day, June 5. There are still quite a few Danish speakers, especially among the elders.  Danebod Historic Complex  Recognized for its architectural and cultural significance, the Danebod Historic Complex, at 101 Danebod Court, was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 30, 1975. The complex includes four historic buildings: the Folk School (built in 1888, rebuilt in 1917), Stone Hall (1889), Cross Church or Danebod Lutheran Church (1893), and Gym Hall (1904). Most of these buildings survived the disastrous fire of 1917, except for the Folk School, which burned down and was rebuilt the same year. These buildings also stood through the devastating 1918 tornado, which killed 36 people in the community. All four structures were built in a simplified Greek Cross floor plan to signify a religious purpose.Minnesota Society (2005). Architecture Minnesota, Volume 31. Bill Dorn Associates, Incorporated. Page 17. Closest to Lake Danebod stands the Folk High School, a three-story wooden building with eight gables. Next to the Folk High School stands the multipurpose Stone Hall, and across the street stands the Gym Hall with its iconic twin towers. Danebod Lutheran Church is located on the town's main street, appropriately named Tyler Street, and is in the shape of a Greek cross on the outside. Danebod Lutheran Church in 2018 * The Danebod Lutheran Church (also known as the Cross Church at Danebod) was dedicated Sunday, June 16, 1895. It is a cruciform clapboard building with a square placed obliquely in the center. The tower in the middle is carried at a 45 degree angle to the arms of the cross. The outside and interior detailing of the church is Eastlake. It was built largely with volunteer labor and money pledged by the early settlers, who had little to give. Points of interest include the altar chairs, kerosene lamps, architectural structure, wainscoting walls and ceiling, porthole windows as in a ship, hand-carving on the altar, pulpit and railing, the candelabra and altar cloth, hand-carved stone baptismal font, the Star of Bethlehem in the ceiling, Bertel Thorvaldsen's statue of Christ, the Celtic cross, and pictures in the narthex. The church is located at 101 Danebod Court. The church was established by the organization that later became the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (DELCA). This organization later merged into the Lutheran Church in America (LCA) in 1962 and then into the largest Lutheran church in the U.S. in 1988: the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Danebod Lutheran Church remains a part of the ELCA still today. * The Danebod Stone Hall was built in 1889 and is a single-floor stone building in the form of a Latin cross. Its entrance wing features medieval-inspired crenellations, but the rest of the building with its pedimented windows are closer to being Greek Revival. It was built from native field rock hauled in by farmers and split and shaped by a Danish stonemason named Kristian Klink. The Stone Hall was used as the first church, later as a gymnasium and assembly hall. Points of interest are the outdoor old bell from the former children's school, fresco from the Gym Hall, the old chandelier from the Cross Church, old photographs, and handcut field stone in the structure. The Stone Hall is now a museum housing a collection of photographs, publications and objects important in Danebod history. It is also a venue for activities, lectures and discussion groups, and is typically open for public viewing during the Danebod Family Camp sessions. * The Danebod Gym Hall was erected in 1904 and is a cruciform clapboard building. The two sides of the entrance arm project forward to the eaves, and the sides plus a small roof enclose the entrance. It was originally built as a space for Danish gymnastics, folk dancing, music, theatrical performances, larger social gatherings, and worship for the Folk School students and other locals. Every year in the Gym Hall, the Danebod Lutheran Church upholds the Danish tradition of dancing around the Christmas tree. The basement is also commonly used for crafts such as stained glass and woodworking. In 1928 it was enlarged with a stage, basement and furnace. Many home talent plays were presented there, and it is still used for an occasional play, and is also used by the camps and retreats for folk dancing. Points of interest are the statue with an original canvas curtain with advertising, bars used years ago by gymnasts (on the south wall), and the original wainscoting on the walls. * The Danebod Folk School was first built in the year 1888, but it burned to the ground on February 25, 1917. It was soon rebuilt, and nine months later the current school building was completed. A three-story brick building, it has gable ends carried up as parapets. The four-story crenelated corner tower and the pointed arches at the entrance are from Gothic and native Danish architecture. The Folk School was renovated in 1946 and is now used by the Danebod Lutheran Church for camps and retreats, and as a meeting place for local groups and clubs. Points of interest are the hand-carved podium in the lecture hall, the picture behind the podium, the hand-carved wooden cross on the podium, collection plates made by Dr. Thomsen, and also the statuary in the lecture hall and sitting rooms, pictures in the sitting rooms, and the small podium in the dining room. Early settlers of the colony founded a residential school in the Danish tradition of folk High Schools and fostered the concept of \\"learning for living\\", by which individuals sought to become enlightened and thoughtful citizens. The Folk School Building stands as a testament to these values, and continues to serve as a place for fellowship and lifelong learning. Each dormitory style room is unique in plan and decoration. A large kitchen and dining area provide a perfect setting for group meals and activities. A lecture hall and several classrooms allow ample space for programming.

The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1860 by the architect F. Meinhardt. The church seats about 330 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1432, but the exact date of its founding is not known. In 1665, the church was described as being a cruciform design and that the building had recently been remodeled. That church existed until 1750 when it was in such poor condition that it was torn down and a new wooden, cruciform church was built on the same site. In 1859 this church too was torn down, and the present church building was constructed. The new church was put into use in 1860.

Designed by the IBI Group, the SkyWalk was opened in 1989 as a predominantly indoor connection from Union Station to the SkyDome. The primary purpose of the SkyWalk is to reduce the need for additional parking spaces near the stadium by providing a direct transportation link to the subway and GO Transit regional trains. A post- modern curved metal and glass structure, the SkyWalk was the first major construction project in the former railway lands after the CN Tower.The SkyWalk could come crashing to the ground, BlogTO, 2013 On 17 July 2014, the Toronto Preservation Board passed a motion recommending that Toronto City Council allow the demolition of the SkyWalk to make way for a 48-storey office and retail tower called Union Centre. On 6 June 2015, the Union Pearson Express station was opened within the SkyWalk. Routing The location of the original Union Station where the SkyWalk is now The SkyWalk begins at the western end of Union Station and first runs through the York Street Teamway, which runs above and parallel to York Street. It then passes through the second and third stories of the Canadian National Express Building, a heritage listed property completed in 1929, which acted as a terminus for horse-drawn carts delivering goods from Union Station.Heritage Conservation District Plan, Heritage Toronto The SkyWalk then assumes the form of a long arcade, running parallel to Station Street. Along the southern side of this corridor, the main section of SkyWalk, is the terminus station for the Union Pearson Express rail link to Pearson Airport, which opened in 2015. A GoodLife Fitness occupies the lower floors of the Canadian National Express building and extends beneath the arcade. At the western end of the arcade, the SkyWalk rises onto an elevated walkway and crosses the rail tracks leading into Union Station and Lower Simcoe Street on a north-south, then northeast-southwest alignment, with a connection to another walkway leading to the Delta Hotel and Southcore Financial Centre. It becomes east-west adjacent to the upper level of the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, with a direct connection to the South Building and a bridge to the North Building.

The castles protected the border between the Kingdom of Poland and the Kingdom of Hungary, as well as a very important international trade route, which went along the Dunajec and the Poprad all the way down to the Danube river. Most of the castles are in ruins now, and some have disappeared. Their history dates back to the period known as the Fragmentation of Poland in the early 12th century, when, according to his will, known as the Testament of Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth, the country was divided into several provinces. The Dunajec river castles were located on the territory of two castellanies, Wojnicz and Nowy SƒÖcz, in the extreme south of the Seniorate Province.Zamki nad Dunajcem i Popradem by dr Krzysztof Moskal, Moje Miasto Tarnow, October 28, 2012  Castles  = Wielka Wie≈õ - Trzewlin Castle = Construction of Trzewlin Castle began in the early 14th century, and was initiated by the Bia≈Çon family (Rawa coat of arms), which later changed its last name to Trzewli≈Ñski. In the 15th century, the castle belonged to the Wielowieyski family (P√≥≈Çkozic coat of arms). According to 19th-century historian and ethnographer ≈ªegota Pauli, in 1543 Trzewlin Castle was visited by King Sigismund I the Old, and his wife Bona Sforza, to escape an epidemic. It is not known when the castle was abandoned. Most likely, it was destroyed during the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655‚Äì1660), and in the late 17th century, its walls were pulled down by the residents of Wojnicz.Zamki Polskie, Wielka Wie≈õ, Trzewlin All that remains are a dry moat and small remnants of the walls. Trzewlin Castle was located on a hill called Panie≈Ñska Gora, on the left bank of the Dunajec, rising 120 meters above the river valley. The complex consisted of three parts: the upper castle (square-shaped, with measurements 40 by 40 meters), the lower castle (triangular shaped), and a round fortified settlement, separated from both castles by the moat. The ruins are some 12 kilometers southwest of Tarn√≥w, and 3 kilometers south of Wojnicz. = Melsztyn ‚Äì Melsztyn Castle (ruin) = The castellan of Krak√≥w, Spicymir (Leliwa coat of arms) started the construction of Melsztyn Castle in 1340. In 1362, Bishop Bodzanta blessed the Holy Spirit chapel in the castle. For 200 years the complex remained in the hands of the powerful noble family of Leliwita Melszty≈Ñski (see Spytek of Melsztyn), who in the late 14th century built a Gothic keep, located in the west wing of the castle. In the 15th century, Melsztyn was one of centres of the Polish Hussite movement, and in 1511, Jan Melszty≈Ñski sold it to the castellan of Wi≈õlica, Miko≈Çaj Jordan of My≈õlenice. Around 1546, Spytek Jordan ordered the remodelling of the Gothic keep, turning it into a Renaissance residence. After the marriages of his two daughters, Melsztyn became the property of the Tar≈Ço family, and in 1744, it came into the hands of the Lanckoro≈Ñski family. Ruins of the Melsztyn Castle Melsztyn Castle was destroyed by the Russians in 1771, during the Bar Confederation, and has been a ruin since. In 1789‚Äì1796, parts of the complex were pulled down, for building material for a church at Domos≈Çawice. In the following years, the ruins were neglected, which resulted in the collapse of the keep (1846). In 1879-85, due to the efforts of Karol Lanckoro≈Ñski, the castle gained the status of a permanent, protected ruin. Since 2008, it has belonged to the gmina of Zakliczyn. The castle features in paintings of Jan Matejko, Napoleon Orda, and Maciej Bogusz Steczy≈Ñski. Melsztyn Castle is located near regional road nr. 980, which goes from Nowy SƒÖcz to Tarnow. = Czch√≥w ‚Äì Czch√≥w Castle (ruin) = Ruins of the Czch√≥w Castle The history of the Czch√≥w Castle dates back to the 13th century, when a Romanesque watchtower was built there. In the 14th century, a defensive castle was added to the tower. It became the residence of the Czch√≥w starostas, and was destroyed in the Swedish wars of the mid-17th century (see Deluge). Finally, when the castle lost its military importance it was turned into a prison, which was closed in 1772, after the first partition of Poland. Currently, the only remaining parts of the building are a 14th-century tower and foundations of the defensive wall. The tower is open to visitors from May to October 31.Baszta - zamek w Czchowie = Wytrzyszczka ‚Äì Tropsztyn Castle (reconstructed) = Tropsztyn Castle was probably built in the early 13th century by the O≈õmior√≥g family. It was first mentioned in 1231, and remained in the hands of the family for 300 years. A royal edict of 1535 handed Tropsztyn to the castellan of Sandomierz, Piotr Kmita. Some time in the second half of the 16th century, it probably became the hide-out of highwaymen, as it was partially destroyed in 1574 by the owners of Ro≈ºn√≥w, due to the ‚Äúassaults, organized from the castle‚Äù.Zamek Tropsztyn i Skarb Ink√≥w By 1608, Tropsztyn, which belonged to the Zborowski family, already was described as a ruin. Tropsztyn Castle Archaeological works were carried out in 1863 by a Nowy SƒÖcz historian Szczƒôsny Morawski. In 1970, it was purchased by Andrzej Benesz, and Tropsztyn was reconstructed in 1993. Now the castle is open to visitors in July and August. According to legend, an Inca treasure is hidden somewhere in Tropsztyn, as its late 18th century owner, Sebastian Berzewiczy, went to Spanish Peru, where he married an Inca princess, and returned to Poland with the treasure. = Ro≈ºn√≥w ‚Äì Ro≈ºn√≥w Castle (reconstructed) = Ro≈ºn√≥w Castle, located 20 kilometers north of Nowy SƒÖcz, consists of a medieval ‚Äúupper castle‚Äù and Renaissance fortifications (‚Äúlower castle‚Äù). Its history dates back to the 13th century, when the Gryfita family built a watchtower. The castle itself was probably built in 1350‚Äì1370 by Piotr Rozen (Gryf coat of arms).Zamki w Polsce. Ro≈ºn√≥w, Zamek G√≥rny It is oblong in shape, 44 meters by 20 meters. In 1426, the castle was purchased by one of the most famous Polish knights, Zawisza Czarny, and after his death, it belongdvto his sons. In the late 15th century, Ro≈ºn√≥w passed to the Wyd≈∫ga family, and later, to the Tarnowski family. Ro≈ºn√≥w Castle In the first half of the 16th century, during the Polish Golden Age, Hetman Jan Tarnowski began to reconstruct the fortress at Ro≈ºn√≥w. He planned one of the most effective fortresses in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, guarding the southern border of the nation against the Ottoman Empire, which, after the Battle of Moh√°cs emerged as the dominant state in Southeastern Europe. Tarnowski‚Äôs death in 1561 put an end to these plans, and the construction was never completed. = Gr√≥dek nad Dunajcem ‚Äì Gr√≥dek nad Dunajcem Castle (does not exist) = Gr√≥dek nad Dunajcem Castle was probably built in the early 14th century by Klemens de Gr√≥dek, on the Grodzisko Hill in the village of Gr√≥dek nad Dunajcem. The building was destroyed either in the late 14th or early 15th century, its ruins were visible as late as early 20th century. Currently, no traces remain of the castle, and the Grodzisko Hill is an island (called Monkey Island) on the Ro≈ºnowskie Lake.Zamek w Gr√≥dku nad Dunajcem = Kur√≥w ‚Äì Kurowska G√≥ra Hill Castle (does not exist)= Kurowska G√≥ra Castle also known as Curow castrum in 1308 and later was mentioned by Jan D≈Çugosz. For some time, the estate probably belonged to Bishop Jan Muskata. Little is known about the castle, which was located in the village of Kur√≥w. Some sources record it as Lemiesz Castle.J. Zaremba, Zamki i grody SƒÖdecczyzny = Nowy SƒÖcz ‚Äì Royal Castle = Nowy SƒÖcz Castle = Zabrze≈º ‚Äì Zabrze≈º Castle (does not exist) = This medieval castle was in the village of Zabrze≈º, near Nowy SƒÖcz, on the left bank of the Kamienica river, near its confluence with the Dunajec, 84 meters above the riverbed. In ancient times, this had been a Lusatian Gords settlement, and in the 13th century, a small defensive castle was built. It was built in stone, in a circular shape with a circumference of some 30 meters. What remains now are traces of the moat. Historians have been unable to establish the owners of the castle, as there are very few documents. The village of Zabrzez itself was first mentioned in 1312. Furthermore, it is not known when the castle was destroyed nor by whom. Remains of the walls were still visible in the early 20th century.Zamek w Zabrze≈ºu = Kro≈õcienko nad Dunajcem ‚Äì Pieniny Castle = The ancient castle was built on the northern slope of a steep hill, several meters below its summit, in the immediate vicinity of the Trzy Korony peaks in the Pieniny Mountains. The building was small, due to lack of space, but placed in a spot which provided a natural defence. The length of the defensive walls was 88 meters, and the walls were 1 meter thick, made from the local limestone rock. The gate was in western part of the castle, below which cellars were built. According to Jan D≈Çugosz, during the disastrous Mongol invasion of Poland (1259), Prince Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste fled to Pieniny Castle also referred to as Castro Pyeniny, together with his mother and wife Kinga of Poland. Historians however doubt D≈Çugosz, asserting that construction of the castle was not started till the 1280s.Kro≈õcienko nad Dunajcem - Zamek Pieniny The castle guarded the southern border of Lesser Poland, and probably was abandoned by the first half of the 14th century and was destroyed in the 15th century (most likely in 1433, during a Hussite raid. = Niedzica ‚Äì Dunajec Castle = Niedzica Castle . = Czorsztyn ‚Äì Czorsztyn Castle = Czorsztyn Castle . = Szaflary ‚Äì Szaflary Castle (does not exist) = The castle was located on a limestone rock, on the left bank of the White Dunajec. In the 13th and 14th centuries, together with the village of Szaflary, it belonged to the Cistercian abbey from Lud≈∫mierz and Szczyrzyc. In 1380, it became royal property. In 1470‚Äì80, during the reign of Casimir IV Jagiellon, the castle was rented to a local nobleman Piotr Komorowski. Three years later, Szaflary was taken away from him, as a punishment for his support of Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus. Afterwards, the fortalitium Schaflari turned into a ruin. Szaflary Castle stood on a flat hilltop, measuring of 20 by 30 meters. It was surrounded by a wall, which was in ca. 1474 strengthened by a rampart. Currently, a house stands on the spot where the castle once stood.Zamek w Szaflarach All that remains of the castle are parts of the 14th century defensive wall, together with the rampart.  Gords along the Dunajec  The upper Dunajec is a river which flows among hills, and on several of them along the valley there are remains of early Medieval gords. At Wojnicz, a 10th-century Slavic settlement once existed on a dry island a few meters above the swam. The settlement became a castellany, and turned into the town of Wojnicz. Other gords and settlements were located at: *Zawada Lanckoro≈Ñska (9th-11th centuries, on a hill called Zamczysko) *Bia≈Çawoda - remains of the Lusatian culture gord, located on the Bia≈Çawodzka G√≥ra Hill *Kur√≥w - another Lusatian gord on the Kurowska G√≥ra Hill *Marcinkowice - remains of a Lusatian gord, which in the 9th century was seized by the Slavs, on a hill called Grodzisko *Che≈Çmiec - a Lusatian, later Slavic gord on the Chelm hill *Podegrodzie - two early Piast dynasty gords on two hills *Naszczowice - Lusatian and early Piast gord on the Zamczysko Hill *Maszkowice - Lusatian gord on the G√≥ra Zyndrama Hill *Zabrze≈º - Lusatian gord on the Babia G√≥ra Hill  References   Further reading  #G.

In 1940, they built an obelisk in his honor on the donated land. In 1924, silent actress Adele Blood (1886‚Äì1936) introduced him to Irene Herbert, a nurse who became his companion for four years until his family fired her. He died on October 16, 1931 and his ashes were scattered across the San Fernando Valley. After his death, Irene Herbert claimed she had a $500,000-promisory note from her former employer and sued the Lankershim family, but later gave up and committed suicide.

According to Jarrod Jablonski, the Hogarthian style \\"has many minor variations, yet its focus asserts a policy of minimalism.\\" The configuration was refined in the 1990s, partially through the Woodville Karst Plain Project (WKPP), established in 1985 and considered among the most aggressive cave diving initiatives in the world. Main began diving in 1966 or early 1967 after completing the NAUI Open Water Course, made his first cave dive on a single tank in 1969, and switched to double tanks on a single regulator in 1972. Main describes this period: \\"There was no formal cave training back then. We just worked things out as we went along, and made the things we needed that didn‚Äôt exist.\\" Following a challenging dive, Main decided with fellow diver Bill Gavin that all WKPP deep dives would be on mixed gas. Main, along other members of the WKPP such as Lamar English, George Irvine, and Jablonski all cultivated the idea that there was an ideal equipment configuration that should be standardized among the WKPP divers. As Main put considerable efforts towards streamlining configurations, his middle name was taken to represent the approach. Main asserts that term \\"Hogarthian\\" was initially used as a joke by fellow diving pioneer John Zumrick. While Main continues to work with equipment to create more efficient configurations, the \\"Hogarthian approach\\" became widely known, largely through the WKPP breaking every distance record for cave diving without any fatalities or serious injuries. The configuration is sometimes abbreviated \\"Hog\\" or \\"hog,\\" often by divers who are unaware that it refers to a person, with at least one claim in the DIR diving community that William Hogarth Main is a fictional person. While \\"Hogarthian\\" and \\"DIR\\" were sometimes used interchangeably in early descriptions of the approach, by 2010, \\"Hogarthian\\" referred to gear configuration, as opposed to the holistic system of DIR of which Hogarthian rigs were a part.

As of 2016, she resides in the Western Sayan mountains, in the Republic of Khakassia. Lykova became a national phenomenon in the early 1980s when Vasily Peskov published articles about her family and their extreme isolation from the rest of society. Lykova is the sole surviving member of the family and has been mostly self-sufficient since 1988, when her father died.  Early life  Lykova was born in a hollowed out pine washtub in 1944 to Karp Osipovich Lykov and Akulina Lykova. She was their fourth child, and the second to be born in the Taiga.Dash, M. (29 January 2013). For forty years, this Russian family was cut off from all human contact, unaware of World War II.. The Smithsonian. Lykova lives up a remote mountainside in the Abakan Range, away from the nearest town. For the first 35 years of her life, Lykova did not have contact with anyone outside of her immediate family. Information about the outside world came from her father's stories and the family's Russian Orthodox Bible.Vice. (1 April 2013). . In the summer of 1978, a group of four geologists discovered the family by chance, while circling the area in a helicopter. The scientists reported that Lykova spoke a language \\"distorted by a lifetime of isolation\\" that sounded akin to a \\"slow, blurred cooing\\". This unusual speech led to the misconception that Lykova was mentally disabled. Later, after observing her skill in hunting, cooking, sewing, reading and construction, this original misconception was revised.Peskov, V. (1994). Lost in the Taiga: One Russian family's 50-year struggle for survival and religious freedom in the Siberian wilderness. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Peskov's book reports that Lykova's vocabulary expanded as she made further contact with the larger world, and he reports many of her uses of \\"unexpected\\" words in conversation.  Isolation  In 70 years, Lykova has ventured out of the family settlement six times. The first time was in the 1980s, shortly after Vasily Peskov's articles about the family's isolation turned them into a national phenomenon. The Soviet government paid for her to tour the Soviet Union for a month, during which time she saw airplanes, horses, cars and money for the first time. Since then, she has only left to seek medical treatment, visit distant relatives and to meet other Old Believers. Lykova prefers her life in the taiga to life in the larger towns or cities. She claims that the air and water outside of the taiga makes her sick. She also said that she finds the busy roads frightening.Martin, J. (2 April 2013). Meet the last Lykov. Vice Magazine. In 2011 Agafia formally re-joined the Belokrinitskaya branch of the Old Believers during a visit by Metropolitan Korniliy (Titov) coinciding with her 69th birthday. In 2014, she wrote a letter that was published online, requesting anyone to come to her home to be her helper as her \\"health is waning\\". She claimed in that letter to have \\"a lump on [her] right breast\\", a possible sign that she has developed cancer. In January 2016, it was reported that Lykova was airlifted to a hospital due to leg pain. Agafia was treated at a hospital in Tashtagol, and planned to return to the wilderness once emergency services were able to airlift her home. According to the questionable source The Siberian Times she did and as of mid-2019 she was still living there.Siberian hermit, 75, who ‚Äòlives in 18th century‚Äô refuses to be moved by Space Age  Relationships  During her talks with Peskov, Lykova told him she was married to someone during one of her trips outside of the taiga. No further information was offered. For 18 years, Lykova had a neighbour, Yerofei Sedov (one of the geologists who visited the area). Sedov told Vice journalists that he came to the Taiga to help Lykova. Due to his old age and disability, however, he heavily relied on Lykova for food and firewood throughout his stay. While the two were generally on friendly terms, there were two occasions where Lykova says that Sedov threatened her and \\"behaved sinfully\\". Sedov died on 3 May 2015, at the age of 77.

It is a three-storey stone structure situated on the crest of a hill, 13 km from Ahmednagar city in the state of Maharashtra, India, The tomb is about 3080 feet above sea level on the top of a hill, 700‚Äì800 feet above the city, offering good views of the surrounding landscape and visible from almost anywhere in the city.Chand Bibi Palace View around 1920 It is believed that the structure was planned to be seven-storey but only three were built. The building is plain and having eight sided platform. By the simple contrivance of a stone terrace built about twelve feet high and 100 yards broad, the tomb seems to rise with considerable dignity from the centre of an octagon. The tomb has angular holes so has been given that rise so during sunset, sun light falls on it.  Architecture & Design  The two tombs one of Salabat Khan and one of his wives -are covered by a dome supported on three piers of elegant pointed arches. On its octagonal plan the monument rises like a tower from a twelve foot wide base to a height of seventy feet and there projects from its interior face a continuous gallery twelve feet broad all round. Access to the gallery is provided by a narrow staircase which is hidden in the wall. Though very little of ornament is associated with it the three architectural features which distinguish this monument‚Äînamely, the octagon platform, the piers of pointed arches and its gallery entitle it to a place of honour among the Islamic monuments of Ahmadnagar. The tomb of Salabat khan and his wife rest in an octagonal basement. Above rises a three storey octagon, some 23 metres high. Each side is marked by tiers of broad arched openings, the other two with projecting balconies on lotus brackets. The double-height octagonal chamber is surrounded by domed bays on eight sides. The austere but impressive tomb stands on a spacious hilltop terrace, commanding views across the plain to Ahmadnagar 10 kilometres to the west. Salabat Khan II Salabat Khan II, was a minister of the fourth Nizam shah, Murtaza who ascended the throne in 1565. A great statesman, Salabat Khan was appointed minister in 1579, after the half-mad Murtaza put to death his regent, Changiz Khan, in a fit of suspicion and rage. Chand Bibi Chand Bibi (1550‚Äì1599 CE) was an Indian Muslim woman warrior who acted as the Regent of Ahmednagar (1596‚Äì99) during her son Murtazi's minority. She is best known for defending Ahmednagar against the Mughal forces of Emperor Akbar. She was ultimately killed by an enraged mob of her own troops.

Crown advocates will be expected to have an up-to-date knowledge of all criminal offences and will maintain a high volume of casework, which will include the review of more serious and complex cases.Job description of Crown Advocate from CPS website . There are also senior and principal crown advocates. British Supreme Court for China and Japan The position of Crown Advocate was created in the British Supreme Court for China and Japan in 1878. The first holder of the position was Nicholas John Hannen. The position was similar to the position of an Attorney General in a colony. The Crown Advocate was not a full-time employee of the Foreign Office but received payment for acting as Crown Advocate. The Crown Advocate was allowed to accept cases from private clients that did not conflict with his role as Crown Advocate.Clark, Douglas, Gunboat Justice: British and American Law Courts in China and Japan (1842-1943), Volume 1, p193-5 Malta The position of Crown Advocate was created in 1839 to replace the office of Attorney General. The position was abolished in 1922 and taken over by the Treasury Counsel. In 1936, the role of Treasury Counsel was taken over by the newly re-created office of Attorney General. Australia =New South Wales= The Crown Advocate is appointed under the provisions of the Crown Advocate Act, 1979 (Act No.59). The Crown Advocate advises the Attorney General, particularly on questions arising under the criminal law, and appears for the NSW Government in criminal proceedings of special significance Under the Act the Crown Advocate assists the Solicitor General in respect of the exercise or discharge by the Solicitor General of any powers, authorities, duties or functions delegated by the Attorney General under section 4 of the Solicitor General Act, 1969.NSW State Records Investigatgor =South Australia= The Crown Advocate is responsible for the conduct of the State‚Äôs major civil and commercial litigation, and will act as senior trial counsel in more complex matters. =Tasmania= From 1973 to 1986 the senior government prosecutor in Tasmania was known as the Crown Advocate. The title was changed to Director of Public Prosecutions in 1986.

The story is set in the Indian city of Mumbai against the backdrop of the Mumbai Police Encounter killings, a series of alleged extrajudicial slayings carried out by an elite squad of policemen.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,404315,00.html The story contains a western crime noir narrative, and a setting and structure inspired by Bollywood movies.  Publication history  The first volume, titled \\"Good Cop, Bad Cop\\", was launched at the San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2012. It was initially made available as a digital comic from Comixology, serialized into a 9-issue run. The hardcover print edition was released on 21 May 2013.  Plot  \\"Good Cop, Bad Cop\\" follows the story of Arjun Kadam, a washed-out, drug-addicted ex-cop in Mumbai, as he tries to solve the murder of a street urchin. His investigation brings him face to face with his own murky past as a member of the Encounter Squad of the Mumbai Police. The story begins in media res at the chronological end as Kadam is involved in a bloody shoot-out in the alleys of the Dharavi slums. A series of flashbacks follow his tale as he navigates the Mumbai Underworld, forming alliances with gangsters against his former colleagues, the Encounter Cops.  Influences  Mumbai Confidential is inspired by the \\"Mumbai gangster noir\\" movies by Ram Gopal Verma, Anurag Kashyap, and others, including Satya, Company, and Black Friday. Hardboiled crime fiction from the West also has major influences on the series. It is thematically influenced by the Hong Kong crime movies and seminal crime-noir comics like Criminal, Sin City, and 100 Bullets.  Reception  The series has been well received by reviewers, especially for its unique setting (a crime-noir tale set in Mumbai, India). The painted art of the title has also been generally favorably mentioned by reviewers, along with the \\"grim and gritty\\" execution of the story. Publishers Weekly found the book to be \\"stylish, sophisticated, and metropolitan: a fresh entry in the noir genre with an Asian twist.\\" Library Journal praised the book's story and art : \\"The twisty plot, well-tuned slang dialog, and unpredictable characters make this an appealing read for adult crime noir buffs looking for an international take on classic tropes.\\", while noting the use of \\"plenty of violence and strong language plus some inexplicit sex.\\" A review in Paste Magazine criticised the scrambled timeline of the narrative and the varying art style as distracting: \\"The overall hash (not only the varying quality of the contributions, but also the rearranged chronology of the narrative) resembles Danny Boyle‚Äôs Slumdog Millionaire, and not just because of the setting. Both are magpies for ideas, more invested in throwing too much at a problem than in simplifying it, and although this tendency makes the result a sort of garbage salad, its provocations have a liveliness that saves the final product to a degree.\\". The review also pointed out the use of \\"gratuitous profanity\\" in the book, while noting that the story played with and subverted classic tropes of hardboiled fiction: \\"It‚Äôs rich material, and although Mohapatra relies too much on gratuitous profanity and violence mixed with sentimentality, he also explicitly nods to conventions, like when his protagonist Kadam monologues while mocking the fact that he‚Äôs doing so.\\"  References  ","title":"Mumbai Confidential"},{"id":"39856674","text":"Assael is a surname.

He received particular recognition for the co-discovery with H. Wolf-Watz (Umea, Sweden) of the bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS). T3SS is a mechanism by which many bacteria inject a cocktail of toxins, so-called effector proteins into animal, plant or insect cells. The effectors disarm or reprogram the target cell by sabotaging the cellular signaling network. The T3SS apparatus, called injectisome, is a complex nanosyringe made of more than 25 different proteins.

Distinction should be made between the Public Attorney's Office of the Republic of Serbia and the Public Defender (which is, in some countries, also referred to as public attorney or public attorney's office), because these are two different institutions. Public Attorney's Office of the Republic of Serbia performs functions witch in English and other languages to refer to as the State Attorney or Attorney General. The current Public Attorney of the Republic of Serbia is Olivera Stanimiroviƒá, appointed by the Government of the Republic of Serbia. History The institution of a public attorney's office (Attorney General - State Attorney) has a long tradition in Serbia. Since the year of 1842, in, then existing, Principality of Serbia, the State Financial Manager () was established as a separate organ of the state, with the competence to perform the duty of a state attorney. This separate organ of the state was abolished only after a year, and the function of a state attorney's office was sent back within the competence of the Ministry of finance. However, within that Ministry, the function of the state attorney's office was always performed by particular employees - State Attorney (), of which fact we can find a trace in the Manual for a State Attorney from the year of 1848. In this form, the State Attorney's Office existed in Serbia until the year of 1934, when a Law on the State Attorney's Office came to power. By this Law, for the first time, the position and organization of the State Attorney's Office as a separate organ of the state within the Ministry of finance, was established in whole details. After World War II, the name was changed to the State Attorney's Office in the Public Attorney's Office, without essential change of competencies of this organ. Competences The Public Attorney is the person who represents the state's authorities in the courts and administrative bodies, and advises the government in civil law matters. As such, crimes and offences are prosecuted by the Public Prosecutor. The competence of The Public Attorney's Office is determined by Articles 7‚Äì10, 12 and 13 of LoPAO, according to which The Public Attorney's Office: * undertakes legal measures and uses legal instruments in front of courts and other competent bodies, for the purpose of realization of rights and interests of the Republic of Serbia, its organs and organizations, as well as other legal persons, the financing of which is being provided from the budget of the Republic of Serbia or other sources provided by the Republic, in private law matters; in those procedures, The Public Attorney's Office represents the Republic of Serbia and i's organs and organizations as a legal representative; * can represent other legal persons regarding their rights and interests in private law matters, in cases that interests of those legal persons are not in confrontation with the function The Public Attorney's Office performs; * can initiate the initiative for estimation of constitutionality and legality of laws, other regulations and general acts in front of the Constitutional Court, in situations when the interest of the Republic of Serbia is being jeopardized. * undertakes necessary actions, prior to initiating a lawsuit, or other procedure, for amicable settlements in cases the nature of a dispute allows it; a legal or civil person tending to initiate a procedure against the Republic of Serbia or against a legal person of which the legal rights and interests are represented by The Public Attorney's Office, can submit a proposal for the amicable settlement to The Public Attorney's Office. Within a deadline of 30 days, The Public Attorney's Office has a duty to inform the party about undertaken measures and their results; * provides the legal persons it represents, with legal opinions on contracts and other private law issues, within 30 days, starting from the moment of the delivery of a request. The competence of The Public Attorney's Office is also determined by a range of other laws and other legal documents. A part of that competence represents specially emphasized role of The Public Attorney's Office as a legal representative of the Republic of Serbia or a legal advisor of the state organs in specific legal procedures, that is to say, specific legal situations. The other part of that special competence refers to situations in which The Public Attorney's Office acts not as a legal representative of the Republic of Serbia, but as an independent party in a procedure. Some of these special competences are determined by the following regulations: * The Law on Trade of Real Estate (‚ÄúOfficial Herald of the Republic of Serbia‚Äù no. 42/98 and 111/09) ‚Äì submitting lawsuits for the annulment of contracts on the basis of which a legal person deprives a real estate from the state or social property, or acquires a real estate to the state or social property, in cases that the stipulated price is in a disproportion with the turnover value of a real estate at the time of the conclusion of a contract, damaging that way the state or social property, * The Law on Public Property (‚ÄúOfficial Herald of the Republic of Serbia‚Äù no. 72/11), Article 38, submitting lawsuits for the annulment of contracts which deprive or acquire real estate property of the Republic of Serbia, which are concluded in a contradiction to regulations, that is to say, if a stipulated compensation is in a disproportion with a determined compensation or a compensation which could be achieved at the time of the conclusion of a contract, * The Law on Public Property (‚ÄúOfficial Herald of the Republic of Serbia‚Äù no. 72/11), Article 84, paragraph 2. and 3, submitting lawsuits for estimating the share of state property in assets which a legal person is using, which are built, or acquired by the share of the assets of the Republic of Serbia, the Province, the Municipality, or the City, * The Law on Planning and Construction (‚ÄúOfficial Herald of the Republic of Serbia‚Äù no. 72/09, 81/09, 64/10, 24/11, 121/12, 42/13 and 50/13), Article 68 ‚Äì giving approval to the request of the owner or the lease holder of a parcel, for the correction of the border of a parcel, by incorporating of the building land in public property to existing parcel, in order to form a cadastral parcel which fulfills the conditions of a building parcel, on the basis of parcelation project, * The Law on Planning and Construction, Article 100 ‚Äì submit requests for registration of public property on the basis of conversion of the right to use, on unbuilt and built land in the state property, * The Law on property restitution and compensation (‚ÄûOfficial Herald of the Republic of Serbia‚Äù no. 72/11), Article 39, - taking part as a party in all procedures for property restitution and compensation, * The Law of Administrative Litigations (‚ÄûOfficial Herald of the Republic of Serbia‚Äù no. 111/09), Article 11, paragraph 4. ‚Äì filing administrative litigations if by an administrative act rights and interests of the Republic of Serbia in private law matters are being violated, * The Law on Public Acquisitions (‚ÄûOfficial Herald of the Republic of Serbia‚Äù no. 124/12), Article 148, paragraph 3 ‚Äì filing requests in the case of violation of public interest in the procedure of public acquisition, * The Law on Companies (‚ÄûOfficial Herald of the Republic of Serbia‚Äù no. 36/11 and 99/11), Article 27, paragraph 3. ‚Äì filing lawsuits for a change of a business name of a company by which public morality is violated, * The Law on Civil Procedure (‚ÄúOfficial Herald of the Republic of Serbia‚Äù no. 72/11), Article 193, ‚Äì amicable settlements before starting a litigation in the civil procedure. Every person tending to file a lawsuit against the Republic of Serbia is obliged to file a request for amicable settlement. It is a special kind of extra judicial settlement with the effect of enforceable document, * The Book of Regulations of the Government (‚ÄúOfficial Herald of the Republic of Serbia‚Äù no. 61/06, 69/08, 88/09, 33/10, 69/10, 20/10, 37/11 and 30/13), Article 46, paragraph 2 - giving legal opinions to proposals of acts which are submitted to the Government to adopt, if an act concerns protection of rights and interests of the Republic of Serbia in private law matters or contractual obligations for the Republic of Serbia are being created. The Public Attorney's Office also actively participates in most complex procedures in front of the arbitration councils of the International Chamber of Commerce, in the cases that the Republic of Serbia is the party. In the cases the Public Attorney's Office acts as a legal representative, courts and other bodies are obliged to deliver all documents directly to the competent Public Attorney's Office. The deliveries which are in contradiction with this Article produce no legal effect (Articles 11. and 17. of LoPAO). If a delivery is not carried out directly to the Public Attorney's Office, that means that the Public Attorney's Office is prevented to act as equal party in the procedure, which represents the essential violation of civil procedure provisions (Article 374. paragraph 2 . item 7. of the Law on Civil Procedure). If a decision is achieved in a contradiction with the provisions concerning delivery, it can be challenged by an appeal for above mentioned reasons. The Public Attorney's Office has a right to claim court costs which are calculated by the same Tariff used by the Bar Association. However, the awarded costs are transferred not to the Public Attorney's Office, but to the State budget (Article 15. of the LoPAO). Organization The function of the Public Attorney's Office executes the Public Attorney, who is appointed by the Government for the period of 4 (four) years and can be reappointed. The Public Attorney has deputies, which are appointed by the Government. They execute their duty as a permanent assignment. The function of the Public Attorney or its deputy can perform a person that is a citizen of the Republic of Serbia fulfills general terms for establishing work relations in the state organs, graduated from the Faculty of Law and have 8 (eight) years of working experience in the field. The Public Attorney is responsible for his/her work and the work of the Public Attorney's Office to the Government, while the deputies are responsible to the Public Attorney and the Government.

The band independently released the album Slave to the System in 2002. Spitfire Records re-released the album in 2006. History In 2000, the band Queensr√øche went on a break after finishing a 6-month tour in support of Q2K. Drummer Scott Rockenfield and guitarist Kelly Gray, who played in Queensr√øche at that time, were discussing what to do. Gray had worked with Brother Cane on a project, and remained close to singer and guitarist Damon Johnson and bassist Roman Glick. He called Johnson in the summer of 2000, and suggested him to give Rockenfield a call. Rockenfield knew of the band, but never met them. The name \\"Slave to the System\\" describes the effect of corporate minds on an artist's music, and hints at the band members' dissatisfaction with the record industry, as Rockenfield describes: \\"Every one of us was getting tired of being a 'slave' to the corporate system\\". The name was coined by Gray even before the band members first met. Slave to the System has independently released their album Slave to the System in 2002. The band played one show in Tennessee and another Seattle after this release. In February 2004, Heard left for undisclosed reasons, and they continued as a four-piece. In 2005, Slave to the System were signed to Spitfire Records, who had the album remixed and remastered, and released it on February 21, 2006. In 2006, Johnson said the band's second album was already completed, but to date, it has remained unreleased. \\"Stigmata\\" was released as a single, and peaked at 33 in both the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock categories. In support of the release, the band performed 19 shows in the American South and Midwest between February and April of that year. Due to prior commitments with other bands, other musicians filled in for Glick and Rockenfield on some of the shows. In 2008, the band released two new songs via MySpace, titled \\"Freak\\" and \\"Who I Am Today\\". They have been on hiatus since.

Gray called Johnson in the summer of 2000, suggesting him to give Rockenfield a call. Rockenfield knew of the band, but never met them. Johnson and Glick flew to Washington, and the group set up a studio in Gray's basement, where they started playing right away. Johnson says: ‚ÄúWhen we all met for the first time, we were just having a good time drinking coffee and jamming\\". He also recalls: \\"I remember the consumption of much java, cigarettes and grand slams at Denny's.\\" They were joined by former Sweaty Nipples singer and guitarist Scott Heard. In one week, six songs were written, arranged and recorded, followed by another week in December. Three weeks after the band members first met, the writing, recording and mixing of Slave to the System had been completed, which according to Rockenfield is because the band members had great chemistry together. Parts of the album were also written and recorded at Rockenfield's home studio. It was recorded and mixed by Gray. The band sent demos to various record labels trying to negotiate a record deal. In 2002, they decided to release the album on their own through CD Street.com, to give the fans the opportunity to listen to it, as they had been waiting on it to get release for two years by then. The band played one shows in Tennessee and another Seattle after this release. Eventually, in 2005, the band got signed to Spitfire Records. The original release was remixed and remastered by Spitfire, before they released it on February 21, 2006. The re-release included two new songs, \\"Cruise Out of Control\\" and \\"Ragdoll\\", featuring Gray on vocals. It received radio play and its sales got the album up to number 25 on the charts. \\"Stigmata\\" was released as a single, and peaked at 33 in both the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock categories.

Music The music is from both the old and new schools of rock and metal, including Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Thin Lizzy, Audioslave, and Velvet Revolver. The lyrics to the title track \\"Slave to the System\\" were inspired by the band name, which describes the effect of corporate minds on an artist's music, and hints at the band members' dissatisfaction with the record industry, It evolved one night, when Gray, Heard, and Johnson were trying to finish two or three things over some coffee. Johnson said: \\"I'll always remember us laughing at how cool the lyrics were when we were writing them.\\" \\"Walk the Line\\" is darker than the other songs on the album, and according to Johnson \\"is inspired lyrically by the tragic loss of our friend Tim Saunders\\". \\"Ragdoll\\" is \\"about how a woman's last breath wasn't due to natural causes\\". Critical reception Slave to the System has received mixed to positive reviews. Greg Prato of Allmusic finds that the sound of Brother Cane dominates over the sound of Queensr√øche, saying: \\"there are heaps of radio-friendly rock with a classic rock edge\\", and \\"there's not much here that you haven't heard before on mainstream rock radio.\\" Christa Titus of Billboard calls it \\"a solid album worthy of the radio attention \\"Stigmata\\" is already gathering.\\" Track listing All songs written by Johnson/Gray/Heard/Rockenfield/Glick, except \\"Love This Life\\", written by Johnson/Glick (1999), \\"Cruise Out Of Control\\" and \\"Ragdoll\\", written by Johnson/Gray/Rockenfield/Glick, and \\"Will You be There\\", written by Johnson/Gray (1997). =Original independent release (2002)= # \\"Stigmata\\" (3:14) # \\"Ruby Wednesday\\" (3:02) # \\"Live This Life\\" (4:04) # \\"Slave to the System\\" (4:34) # \\"Abyss\\" (4:13) # \\"Disinfected\\" (3:29) # \\"Gone Today\\" (4:37) # \\"Will You be There\\" (3:38) # \\"Leaves\\" (4:45) # \\"Zero\\" (3:34) # \\"Walk the Line\\" (3:35) =Spitfire re-release (2006)= # \\"Stigmata\\" (3:14) # \\"Ruby Wednesday\\" (3:02) # \\"Slave to the System\\" (4:34) # \\"Live This Life\\" (4:04) # \\"Cruise out of Control\\" (3:54) # \\"Abyss\\" (4:13) # \\"Disinfected\\" (3:29) # \\"Gone Today\\" (4:37) # \\"Will You be There\\" (3:38) # \\"Leaves\\" (4:45) # \\"Walk the Line\\" (3:35) # \\"Ragdoll\\" (4:53) Personnel ;Slave to the System * Damon Johnson ‚Äì lead vocals, guitar * Kelly Gray ‚Äì guitar, vocals * Scott Heard ‚Äì guitar, vocals * Roman Glick ‚Äì bass * Scott Rockenfield ‚Äì drums ;Production * Slave to the System ‚Äì production * Kelly Gray ‚Äì recording, mixing * Eddie Schreyer ‚Äì mastering * Lisa Burton ‚Äì photography * Geno ‚Äì cover design / art References Category:2002 debut albums Category:2006 albums Category:Spitfire Records albums ","title":"Slave to the System (album)"},{"id":"39856992","text":"Nannatukavu\\"Theft of elephant tusk: five held\\".

Like the larger Moses Coulee nearby, it was formed during the Missoula Floods at the end of the last ice age, some 14,000 years ago. Washington State Route 17 between Bridgeport, Washington and Coulee City, Washington follows East Foster Creek along much of the coulee's valley floor. East Foster Creek now flows east to west through Foster Coulee to Grand Coulee. The United States Geological Survey quadrangle map \\"Foster Coulee\\" is named for this prominent feature. Creation of the coulee Foster Coulee vicinity showing ice age floods (blue lines) Foster Coulee was formed during the Missoula Floods. The Okanogan lobe of the Cordilleran Glacier moved down the Okanogan River valley and blocked the ancient route of the Columbia River, backing up water to create Glacial Lake Columbia. Initially, floodwater discharged from Glacial Lake Columbia by running up through the head of Grand Coulee and down through Foster Coulee to rejoin the Columbia River. After the floods, meltwater from the glacier reversed course and flowed east through the coulee, forming a hanging valley above the west rim of Grand Coulee and a debris fan on the Grand Coulee floor that can be seen today. As the glacier moved further south, Foster Coulee was cut off and the Columbia River then discharged through Moses Coulee. Proposed reservoir Foster Coulee has been studied as a potential pumped- storage hydroelectricity site. The coulee would be dammed and approximately 500 MW generation capacity installed, exploiting the c. difference in elevation between the new reservoir and the existing Banks Lake. Banks Lake is in turn created by pumping water uphill from the Columbia River at the Grand Coulee Dam. Notable wildlife The Washington ground squirrel, a candidate for U.S. Endangered Species Act listing, inhabits Foster Coulee.

In the woods, Paul sneaks up on Barbie and Big Jim to hold them at gunpoint and Linda shows up and shoots Paul, prompting Big Jim to designate her as the new Sheriff. Julia tails Junior into the tunnels, where he is looking to find a way out; he hits the barrier of the dome and his flashlight explodes, but Julia is able to help him and use her matches to guide them out to safety.

It is located to the south of the town centre. The church dates from June 1870, when a temporary iron building was constructed on the corner of Springfield Road and Denmark Road. Bishop Samuel Wilberforce laid the foundation stone for a permanent church in July 1871, on a site donated by William Mercer in the centre of the new Spring Grove Estate. Mercer also gave ¬£2000 towards the cost of building the church, but it was with difficulty that ¬£7000 was raised to build the essentials. The church was consecrated in November 1872 without the tower or spire that were in the original design by the Surbiton architect A. J. Phelps and with little internal ornament. Carvings, paintings, coloured windows and an organ were introduced over time, but the tower, a squat structure with octagonal turret in matching style, was not added until 1935. The church has been Grade II listed since March 1975. In 1974, the pews were removed and new heating and lighting installed, to allow Kingston Polytechnic to use the church on weekdays as an examination hall. Later, the choir stalls and the pulpit were removed.

History During the 1960s, pop music on radio and in both American and British film moved away from refined Tin Pan Alley to more eccentric songwriting and incorporated reverb-drenched rock guitar, symphonic strings, and horns played by groups of properly arranged and rehearsed studio musicians. Many pop arrangers and producers worked orchestral pop into their artists' releases, including George Martin and his strings arrangements with the Beatles, and John Barry for his scores to the James Bond films. Also in the 1960s, a number of orchestral settings were made for songs written by the Beatles, including symphonic performances of \\"Yesterday\\" by orchestras. Some symphonies were specifically founded for playing predominantly popular music, such as the Boston Pops Orchestra. Nick Perito was one of orchestral pop's most accomplished arrangers, composers, and conductors. According to Chris Nickson, the \\"vital orchestral pop of 1966\\" was \\"challenging, rather than vapid, easy listening\\". Spin magazine refers to Burt Bacharach and the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson as \\"gods\\" of orchestral pop. In Nickson's opinion, the \\"apex\\" of orchestral pop lay in singer Scott Walker, explaining that \\"in his most fertile period, 1967‚Äì70, he created a body of work that was, in its own way, as revolutionary as the Beatles'. He took the ideas of [Henry] Mancini and Bacharach to their logical conclusion, essentially redefining the concept of orchestral pop.\\" Ork-pop Ork-pop is a 1990s movement which took its name from orchestral pop.

The work was first published on 18 June 2013 through William Morrow and Company and follows an unnamed man who returns to his hometown for a funeral and remembers events that began forty years earlier. The illustrated edition of the work was published on 5 November 2019, featuring the artwork of Australian fine artist Elise Hurst. Themes in The Ocean at the End of the Lane include the search for self-identity and the \\"disconnect between childhood and adulthood\\". Among other honours, it was voted Book of the Year in the British National Book Awards. Plot summary The book starts with the unnamed protagonist returning to his childhood hometown for a funeral. There he revisits the home in which he and his sister grew up and remembers a young girl named Lettie Hempstock, who had claimed that the pond behind her house was an ocean. He stops at the house where Lettie had lived with her mother and grandmother and encounters a member of her family and starts to remember forgotten incidents from the past. The main narrative starts as he recalls a time when an opal miner, who was living at the boy's home, steals the narrator's father's car and commits suicide in the back seat, having gambled away his friends' money; this death allows a supernatural being to gain access to the narrator's world, leaving money for people in unpleasant ways. After a coin becomes lodged in the narrator's throat overnight, choking him, he seeks his neighbour Lettie's help. She agrees to help, insisting that he accompany her on the travel necessary to find the spirit and bind it. Having been instructed never to let go of her hand, in a moment of surprise he does, and in that instant something lodges in his foot. Once home, he pulls what appears to be a worm out of his foot, but a piece is left inside him. The next day, his mother tells him she is starting a new job and a woman named Ursula Monkton is to look after him and his sister. The narrator takes an instant dislike to her and soon realises that she is actually the worm he had pulled out of his foot. She had used him as a way to travel out of the place he and Lettie had visited and is now inhabiting his house. Ursula quickly ingratiates herself with his family, winning over his sister and seducing his father, while the narrator is alienated from his family and is almost drowned in the bath by his father as Ursula watches. Most of the narrator's time is then spent locked up in his bedroom, avoiding Ursula. Frightened, he manages to escape one night. He barely makes it to the Hempstock farm, where the Hempstocks take care of him and remove the wormhole from his foot, which had been left behind by Ursula as an escape path. Lettie and the narrator confront Ursula, who refuses offers from the Hempstocks to leave peacefully for a world that is less dangerous for her. Unwilling to believe that there could be anything in the world that could harm her, Ursula is attacked and eliminated by \\"hunger birds\\", entities that serve a purpose similar to scavengers. These insist on eating the narrator's heart, as a piece of Ursula's wormhole still remains there. The Hempstocks bring him back to the safety of their property through the ocean by their house, which Lettie carries to him in a bucket. While in the ocean, the narrator understands the nature of all things, but the memory fades once he gets out. The Hempstocks promise to keep him safe, but the hunger birds begin to eat his world in order to force him off the property. This proves effective and the narrator attempts to sacrifice himself, only for Lettie to jump in between him and the hunger birds. Lettie's grandmother threatens the hunger birds, which she refers to as \\"varmints\\", with annihilation if they do not leave. They comply, but Lettie is near death as a result of their attack. The Hempstocks place Lettie's body in the ocean behind their house, where they say that she will rest until ready to return to the narrator's world. After these events, the narrator's memory of the incident fades. He has no recollection of Lettie's near-death, instead believing that she had gone to Australia. The book then returns to the present, where the narrator finishes his remembering and is shocked when the Hempstocks inform him that this is not his first time returning to the house ‚Äì he had visited the house at least twice during his adult years and it is implied that he visited the farm at least once more before that to return a kitten that he had found during his initial travels with Lettie. It is suggested that the hunger birds did eat his heart after all, but Lettie's sacrifice revived him, and his heart has been slowly growing back ever since. His visits to the farm are the result of Lettie wanting to check up on him while she sleeps and heals. The narrator's concern over the unremembered visits soon fades as he begins to forget the past events once again, telling the Hempstock women to tell Lettie he said \\"hello\\" if she contacts them from Australia. Development Gaiman has said that members of the Hempstock family have shown up in several of his other works, such as Stardust and The Graveyard Book. He began writing Ocean for his wife Amanda Palmer and did not initially intend for it to become a novel, instead intending to write a novella; while writing, he inserted things that he knew Palmer would enjoy, as she \\"doesn't really like fantasy\\". Some events in the book were drawn from Gaiman's childhood, such as the theft of a car belonging to the protagonist's father, mirroring a similar event where his father's car was stolen and the thief committed suicide in the vehicle. Reception Critical reception for the book has been generally positive. The New York Times gave a positive review for The Ocean at the End of the Lane, commenting that the book would appeal to multiple age groups. USA Today stated that the novel was thematically similar to Gaiman's 2002 children's novel Coraline and the 2005 film MirrorMask in that the enemy is \\"closer than they might think\\", which \\"makes his monsters that much more sinister when a woman like Ursula is just downstairs\\". An aggregate review site lists it as 81% positive reviews.http://idreambooks.com/The-Ocean-at-the-End-of-the-Lane-A-Novel-by- Neil-Gaiman/reviews/30222 Awards and honours *2013 The New York Times Best Seller list, #1 Hardcover Fiction. *2013 National Book Awards (British), Book of the Year *2013 Kirkus Reviews, The Best Books of 2013 (100 titles) *2013 Nebula Award for Best Novel, Nominee *2013 Goodreads Choice Awards, Fantasy *2014 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel *2014 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel, Nominee Stage adaptation In June 2019, the National Theatre, London, announced they were producing an adaptation of The Ocean at the End of the Lane, written by Joel Horwood and directed by Katy Rudd.

Contents Cities of Bone is an Al-Qadim boxed set that includes six dungeon crawls, mostly portable anywhere in Zakhara, half for beginning characters and the rest for mid-to high levels. The text offers advice for creating a spooky atmosphere, and the historical reasons behind the construction of each dungeon. Half the text makes up the adventure, \\"Court of the Necromancers\\", where in the undead city of Ysawis, the player characters get involved in the intrigues of a couple of repugnant wizards and a senile lich. Publication history Cities of Bone was written by Steve Kurtz. Reception Allen Varney reviewed Cities of Bone for Dragon magazine #219 (July 1995). He comments: \\"The indefatigable Kurtz returns with another mixed lot of adventures in ruined cities. The Al- Qadim line had been held over a year beyond its original plan by the time of this 1994 sourcebox, and this may explain the set's flagging inspiration.\\" He calls the dungeon crawls \\"mostly routine\\" and says that the historical reasons for each dungeon \\"make interesting reading, but these are basically numbered rooms with traps and monsters. These are endlessly popular in other AD&D; worlds, but in Zakhara they fit awkwardly, for (as the text remarks) 'robbing the tombs of enlightened creatures is considered a base and dishonorable profession.'\\" Varney considers \\"Court of the Necromancers\\" to be the set's best adventure, commenting: \\"There's an interesting plot and one well-staged, creepy dinner scene with the two necromancers, but the storyline works only with players who behave with cautious restraint ‚Äî yet the same adventure's dungeon crawl, like all the others here, belongs to the kill-everything-that- moves school of adventure design.

Falck has published numerous works in the fields of histology, endocrinology and neurobiology. Bengt Falck is the son of Hans Falck, city court judge in Malm√∂, Sweden, and Maria Hagander. He married Eva Torp in 1951, and together they had four children. In 1994 he married Inger Vestvik.  Scientific career  Falck became Doctor of Medical Science, equivalent of PhD, in 1959. His thesis focused on the production of estrogen in the ovaries, and he attempted to show that this production is dependent on an interplay of two different hormone producing systems. His hypothesis has come to be called \\"Falck's two-cell hypothesis of oestrogen synthes\\".Falck, B. Site of production of oestrogen in rat ovary as studied in microtransplants. Acta physiol.scand.

In 1960‚Äì61 Falck and Nils-√Öke Hillarp developed the Falck-Hillarp fluorescence method. This technique made it possible to study biologically active substances called monoamines ‚Äì dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and serotonin ‚Äì on the cellular level employing fluorescence microscope. Consequently, it was then possible to demonstrate their presence in the central as well as peripheral nervous system. Thereby, it could be established that these monoamines were actually functioning as interneuronal transmitters (signal substances).

Biography Hillarp was the son of merchant Nils Bengtsson and Hulda, former Johansson, and the brother of Rut Hillarp, a novelist. He became Doctor of Medical Science (equivalent to a Ph.D.) in 1946. He was appointed assistant and later associate professor of Histology at the University of Lund (1946‚Äì1962). The Swedish Medical Research Council enabled him to spend 1960 to 1962 in research at the Department of Pharmacology, University of Gothenburg, then in 1962 he became full professor of Histology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden where he remained until his death in 1965. Research Hillarp's research on the terminal fiber system of the autonomic nervous system was of significant importance, as was his work on the mechanics of nerve impulse transmission. Perhaps his most important research was with Bengt Falck, as they together developed the widely known Falck-Hillarp fluorescence method. This method made it possible to transform certain monoamines, specifically serotonin (5-hydroxitryptamine) and the three cathecolamines dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline to fluorescent substances that could be detected on the cellular level by fluorescence microscopy. By this method Hillarp and Falck could demonstrate the presence of these monoamines in the central as well as the peripheral nervous system with great precision and susceptibility. This became the first, and also the conclusive, evidence of the function of monoamines as interneuronal signal substances (transmitters). Accordingly, it was not Arvid Carlsson who had discovered that dopamine is a signal substance in the central nervous system, as stated by the Nobel Committee at the Karolinska Institute in a press release in 2000.press release They had based their opinion on reports published by Carlsson and co-workers in 1957‚Äì1958. However, Carlsson, Falck and Hillarp published a study in 1962, which was based on the Falck-Hillarp fluorescence method on the cellular location of noradrenaline and dopamine in the brain, showing that noradrenaline is located in nerve cells (neurons) and functions as a transmitter. However, they could not ultimately define the cell type that harbors dopamine and were thus not able to state with certainty that dopamine is a transmitter. Obviously, if Carlsson had discovered this in 1957‚Äì1958, it would have been referred to and extensively discussed in the Carlsson-Falck-Hillarp publication in 1962. Both Hillarp, at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Falck, at the Medical Faculty, University of Lund, had several research assistants, who studied various aspects of transmitters, using the Falck-Hillarp fluorescence method, and it was not long before these two groups had established that dopamine is, indeed, a transmitter. Hillarp and Falck's work was completed in 1961, published in 1962 and was trailblazing in its field. One of the publications was cited in more than 2435 publications and became a part of The 200 Most- Cited Papers of All Time, SCI 1945‚Äì1988, see references nr 7. Many accomplished researchers, were tutored by Hillarp, including Annica Dahlstr√∂m, Nobel prize winner Arvid Carlsson, Kjell Fuxe, Lars Olsson and Tomas H√∂kfelt. The 50-year anniversary of the introduction of the Falck-Hillarp method was celebrated by a symposium in Lund on April 27, 2012 entitled \\"From Nerves to Pills\\". Death and legacy Hillarp died from aggressive malign melanoma, 49 years old. The Hillarp lecture hall at the Karolinska instutet is named after him, and he has been described as \\"a person who would change neuroscience in Sweden, in fact worldwide, perhaps more than any other Swedish scientist.\\" References External links Category:1915 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Lund University faculty Category:Karolinska Institute faculty Category:Swedish neuroscientists ","title":"Nils-√Öke Hillarp"},{"id":"39857374","text":"Joe Vellano (born October 30, 1988) is an American football defensive tackle.

The story takes place largely in the German resort town of Baden-Baden. Background and Critical Reception Ivan Turgenev began work on what was to become Smoke in late 1865 and it's known that he carried a finished manuscript of the novel with him when he visited Russia in early 1867. In St. Petersburg, in February 1867, he gave several public charity readings from chapters of the book, all of which were met with approbation.≈Ωekulin, Nicholas G. ‚ÄúIvan Sergeevich Turgenev (28 October 1818-22 August 1883).‚Äù In Russian Novelists in the Age of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Edited by J. Alexander Ogden and Judith E. Kalb. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 238 (Detroit: Gale Group, 2001), 362. Smoke was first published in the March 1867 issue of The Russian Messenger (–†—ÉÃÅ—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –≤–µÃÅ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ Russkiy vestnik), one of the premier literary magazine of nineteenth century Russia. The reception to Turgenev‚Äôs public readings was a bellwether, for upon publication in Russia the novel was met with almost immediate and universal condemnation in that country. Conservatives were enraged by his portrayal of the nobility, Slavophiles denounced Turgenev for denigrating his native Russia, while revolutionaries called the author a senile dodderer incapable or unwilling to appreciate young Russians‚Äô strength and will. As for Alexander Herzen, the exiled revolutionary the likes of whom Turgenev satirized in the character of Gubaryov, he wrote a largely negative review of the work in his revolutionary publication The Bell.Troyat, Henri. 1988. Turgenev (New York: Dutton), 91-92. The criticism of the novel for its supposed ‚Äúanti-Russian‚Äù attitude arose from the fact that Smoke, more than simply a story of a m√©nage √† trois (or even m√©nage √† quatre) and a failed loved affair, is a Roman √† th√®se, meant largely to display in ironical or farcical light the different strata of Russian society and to offer a political critique on the problems Russia was facing and the shortcomings of Russia‚Äôs would-be saviours.Andretev, Nikolay. 1967. ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù. In Smoke, by Ivan S. Turgenev, ix. Geneva: Heron Books, 1967. Indeed, Smoke is a deeply satirical novel aimed not only at the conservative elements of Russian society who stubbornly refused reform and modernization but also at those Russian Slavophiles Turgenev had witnessed first hand abroad, more specifically Alexander Herzen and his young followers, who were rejecting European culture and glorifying a Slav mysticism in their campaign to remake Russia, and in the process badgering Turgenev for what appeared to them as his slavish adoration of European culture.Troyat, 90. In this, Turgenev focuses his ire on two groups that play prominently in the novel. On the one hand are a group of aristocratic ‚Äúgenerals‚Äù who are resident in Baden and who form part of the entourage surrounding Litvinov's love interest Irina (and one of whom, General Ratmirov, is her husband). Their apparent disdain for Russia includes a pernicious chauvinism. Opposing them is a mixed group of radicals, who represent a new Slavophile socialism that is at least in part derived from the ideas of Herzen and his circle. Thus, for Turgenev, the similarities between them, rather than the surface opposition, lie at the heart of his criticism. Both groups deal in abstracts; both are far removed from any practical realities; and both ignore what for Turgenev remains the necessary element for the future of Russia: hard work in the context of the lessons of Western \\"civilization\\" in the broadest sense and above all concrete practicality. That viewpoint is presented by one of Turgenev's most problematic protagonists, Sozont Potugin, whose unsuccessful personal life stands in sharp contrast with the forcefulness of his Westernist views.≈Ωekulin, Nicholas G. ‚ÄúIvan Sergeevich Turgenev (28 October 1818-22 August 1883).‚Äù In Russian Novelists in the Age of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Edited by J. Alexander Ogden and Judith E. Kalb. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 238 (Detroit: Gale Group, 2001), 362-363. Aside from the few stories within the story, such as the early history of Litvinov and Irina Ratmirov, and the brief concluding chapters, the entirety of the novel takes place in Baden-Baden, a German resort town famous for its waters and gambling houses and a popular gathering spot for the elite of nineteenth century Europe. Turgenev‚Äôs description of the town came first-hand, for he had lived for a period in Baden, the novel was written there, and the episodes and characters are undoubtedly drawn from life. Turgenev had come to Baden-Baden to be near Madame Viardot, the opera singer, and his most intimate, lifelong friend.Reed, John. 1919. ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù. Smoke by Ivan Turgenev. http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/turgenev/ivan/smoke/introduction.html Plot The novel opens in the German bathing resort of Baden-Baden (or simply Baden) in the summer of 1862, where the young Russian Grigory Litvinov has arrived en route home to Russia to meet his fianc√©e Tatiana Shestov, who will soon be arriving with her aunt and guardian, Kapitolina Markovna Shestov, from Dresden. In Baden Litvinov soon encounters Rostislav Bambaev, an acquaintance from Moscow. Later that evening at a social gathering Bambaev introduces Litvinov to the political activist Stepan Nikolaevitch Gubaryov. Litvinov is not overly impressed by the gathering nor especially by the nondescript looking Gubaryov. After this Litvinov returns to a local restaurant where he is approached by Sozont Ivanitch Potugin, who introduces himself to Litvinov as a fellow Russian. Litvinov had noted Potugin at the earlier get-together at Gubaryov‚Äôs where Potugin had not spoken a word. Potugin now opens up to Litvinov and Litvinov in turn is captivated by Potugin‚Äôs way with words. In a rather one-sided conversation Potugin vents his frustrations regarding the Russian character ‚Äì its tendency towards servitude and flights of idealism that lead nowhere. Later back in his rooms, Litvinov finds a letter from his father and also a gift of heliotrope flowers on his windowsill brought by a mysterious woman who, according to the servant, did not leave her name. The letter from his father reveals the superstition of the rural Russian. The flowers, though they come without a note, seem to strike a deep and powerful resonance with Litvinov. Later that night, unable to sleep, he suddenly realizes who might have brought them. The story now reverts to about a decade earlier to relate the background story of the young Grigory Litvinov and Irina Osinin. Acquaintances in Moscow, the two fall in love when barely out of childhood and promise themselves to one another. Unlike Litvinov, Irina comes from an ennobled family of long pedigree, though in recent times fallen into near penury. One day the Osinin family, in view of their nobility, are invited to a ball being thrown by the emperor on his visit to Moscow. Irina agrees to go though she pleads with Litvinov not to go himself and Litvinov acquiesces to her wishes, though he does bring her a bouquet of heliotrope. Irina‚Äôs beauty makes quite an impression at the court ball and the very next day the court chamberlain Count Reisenbach, a relation of the Osinins and a wealthy man with high connections, decides he will adopt his niece Irina and bring her to live with him in St. Petersburg. Irina is heartbroken but bends to her parents‚Äô wishes to become his adopted niece and heiress. It means leaving Litvinov and she writes to him breaking off their relationship. Soon thereafter she is whisked away to St. Petersburg and her new home. The story moves back to Baden. Litvinov wonders excitedly whether it wasn‚Äôt Irina who left him the flowers. The next morning Litvinov decides to escape Baden and the Russian crowd by hiking alone up in the hills around the town's old castle. Stopping later at the old castle for refreshment, he encounters the arrival of a large Russian entourage, clearly composed of Russian nobility of the highest rank, many in military uniforms. Among them, a young woman calls to Litvinov and he soon recognizes her as Irina, his former love. The ten years since their last meeting in Moscow has brought her to her full bloom and he is struck by her mature beauty. Litvinov is introduced to her husband, the general Valerian Vladimirovitch Ratmirov, an affable man who it soon becomes clear holds very conservative opinions, wishing to turn back the clock on all the reforms that have taken place in Russia. As the ‚Äúson of a plebeian‚Äù, Litvinov feels out of place among these aristocrats and put off by their manners and opinions. He bids farewell to Irina and she urges him to come see her while in Baden. The Hohenbaden, or old castle, near Baden-Baden, where Litvinov again meets Irina. Though affected by his meeting with Irina, Litvinov does not go to see her. Several days pass. A letter from Tatiana telling him that she will be delayed arriving in Baden due to the illness of her aunt puts Litvinov in a petulant mood. One day Potugin comes to see Litvinov. Litvinov is glad for the company but soon learns that Potugin knows Irina quite well and that he has in fact come to bring a message from her urging Litvinov to come see her that very day. He agrees. Irina is staying in one of the finest hotels in the city and her husband is away on personal business. Irina and Litvinov have a long talk catching up on the past decade. Irina pleads with Litvinov to forgive her for what she did to him and Litvinov seems to dismiss the notion of forgiveness, as those events were long ago in their childhood. When Litvinov touches upon the flowers left in his room, Irina claims to know nothing about them. The return of Irina‚Äôs husband seems to break up the meeting. Later Litvinov passes Irina again while out walking but feigns not to recognize her. Irina later accosts him on his walk, asking why he ignores her and pleading with him not to do so, for she is desperate and alone and misses their simple relationship. Litvinov tells her what is in his heart, that she meant much to him and was the cause of great anguish and now that their paths and situations are so different he sees no point in renewing an acquaintance has only the potential to hurt again and to reveal to Irina how much power she still holds over him. She urges him again warmly that they might be, if not friends, at least friendly, ‚Äúas if nothing had happened.‚Äù Litvinov promises her not to treat her as a stranger, though he still does not understand her intentions. Irina is then called off by the approach of an aristocratic friend. Litvinov, walking on, again encounters Potugin, now sitting and reading on a bench. They have another lengthy conversation about Russia that Potugin dominates, ridiculing those Slavophiles who are constantly heralding the native Russian genius but who refuse to see that the mastery of things comes with training and education and not through any internal nature or instinct. Litvinov is still unable to learn of just how Potugin knows Irina, only that he has known her for some time. Returning to his rooms, Litvinov later finds an invitation from Irina to attend a soiree in her rooms, where he will be able to meet many from her circle and better understand ‚Äúthe air she breathes.‚Äù Litvinov later attends this soiree and returning to his rooms comes to realize with exhilaration and horror that he loves Irina and that his marriage with Tatiana is threatened by this looming passion. Litvinov decides he must leave Baden and Irina forever and makes arrangements for the omnibus to Heidelberg. He visits Irina‚Äôs hotel rooms to reveal both his love and his determination to leave rather than ruin himself. Irina is moved by this confession and though she initially supports his decision, she later comes to him to confess her love and tells him her destiny is in his hands. Meanwhile, Tatiana and her aunt arrive from Dresden. Litvinov‚Äôs rather distant attitude towards Tatiana has his fianc√©e suspicious that something is not right. When the couple pass Irina on the street and Irina throws them a glance, Tatiana‚Äôs suspicions are further aroused. That evening, rather than staying with his fianc√©e and her aunt, Litvinov goes to see Irina who has summoned him. Irina tells him that he is in no way obligated to her and that he should feel completely free. On the way back to Tatiana‚Äôs rooms Litvinov encounter Potugin, who is forward enough to warn Litvinov to beware of his love for Irina and to not cause Tatiana pain. Litvinov feels insulted by this presumption on the part of Potugin, but the latter assures him he speaks from experience, for he too has been ruined by his love of Irina, albeit a love that has never been and never will be requited. The story then reverts to eight years previous to relate Potugin‚Äôs history with Irina. At that time he was still working as a government official and would visit the country estate of the Count Reisenbach, the guardian of the young Irina, near St. Petersburg. Later, Irina, realizing that the older Potugin had fallen in love with her, uses this leverage to seek a great favour of Potugin. Irina‚Äôs close friend Eliza Byelsky, an orphan but the heir of a wealthy estate, was facing ruin (though left unsaid in the novel, this is understood to be pregnancy out of wedlock). For a large sum of money, but primarily because Irina desired it, Potugin agreed to secretly marry Eliza. Eliza later had her child, a daughter whom Potugin then adopted, before poisoning herself. Since that time Potugin has followed in the train of the Ratmirovs, utterly devoted to Irina. Back at his hotel, Litvinov spends the evening with Tatiana and her aunt. He now tells Tatiana that he has something important he must tell her the next day. Tatiana has a foreboding of what this might be. The next morning a distraught Litvinov attempts to inform Tatiana of the situation but it is Tatiana, rather, who guesses he has fallen in love with that other woman they saw on the street. Soon thereafter, Tatiana leaves unceremoniously back to Dresden with her aunt without leaving any farewell note for Litvinov. Meanwhile, Litvinov writes a letter to Irina telling her of his break and urging her to run away with him only if her will is strong enough to stand such a life. If not, he will go away. Irina arranges for him to come see her again when her husband is out, and she reaffirms her commitment to follow him, though all her finances are in her husband‚Äôs hands. Eventually, however, Irina writes to Litvinov telling him that despite her love she is not strong enough to abandon her current life and declaring sorrowfully that she is unable to elope with him. Litvinov is heart-broken and leaves Baden on the train back for Russia. Along the way he muses over the mutability and seeming meaninglessness of all things, which have all the permanence of the smoke being blown forth by the train. Back in Russia Litvinov returns to his estate in time to see his elderly father pass away. On his land Litvinov slowly recovers and even begins gradually to implement some of the land management and agricultural techniques he had learned in Europe. One day he hears through a visiting relative that Tatiana is living not too far away on her own estate with Kapitolina. He writes to Tatiana asking if he might visit her one-day and she responds in the affirmative, signaling to Litvinov that she has forgiven him. Litvinov wastes little time and sets out for her village. At a way station en route he encounters none other than Gubaryov and his brother. They reveal their true colors by their derision of the peasantry and their base treatment of Bambaev who, his finances wiped out, has been forced to become a servant to the Gubaryovs. Arriving at Tatiana's, Litvinov falls at her feet and kisses the hem of her dress. Here the narrator leaves the story, with the note that readers can guess the end by themselves. As he does with almost all his novels, Turgenev then briefly relates what became of some of the other characters. Irina is related to be older but still lovely, with young men still falling in love with her \\"ironical intellect.\\" Her husband is steadily rising in the world. As for Potugin, the little girl he had adopted has died but he still follows in the train of Irina.

They can be classified into linear (curcuminoids) and cyclic diarylheptanoids. The best known member is curcumin, which is isolated from turmeric (Curcuma longa) and is known as food coloring E100. Some other Curcuma species, such as Curcuma comosa also produce diarylheptanoids. They have been reported from plants in 10 different families, e.g. Betulaceae and Zingiberaceae.

His religious fervour was accentuated by his visits to a hermitage near his home when he interacted with monks of different orders. He was a vegetarian and had strict resolution of not to eat any non-vegetarian food; this resolve went to the extreme extent when he even walked out of a relative's house when he was 10 years old where they had cooked a non-vegetarian meal and were forcing him to eat it. Soon after, Nrisimha Prasad remarried, but, Datta could not adjust with his stepmother and went to live in a relative's house. Ram continued his education, in spite of several adversities, at the General Assembly‚Äôs Institution (now Scottish Church College). He then joined the Campbell Medical School in Calcutta and graduated. He married Krishnapreyashi and during his marriage Vivekananda was the best man as they had the best of filial bonding. Career After his graduation Ram joined as an assistant to the Government Quinine Examiner. Once his financial position improved he purchased a house in the central Calcutta. Ram took deep interest in chemistry while working with an English supervisor. He invented an antidote for blood dysentery from an extract of an indigenous medicinal plant which got the seal of approval from the government. Leading doctors started prescribing it and he became famous and as a result he was appointed a member of the Chemist Association of England. He was then elevated to the post of Government Chemical Examiner. He also started teaching to the military medical students at the Calcutta Medical College. He also started teaching modern science which made him an atheist and he used to say \\"In those days we did not believe in God. We considered that everything happens, changes, or dissolves by the force of nature. We were rank materialists, and we held the view that eating, sleeping, and creature comforts were the summum bommum of life.\\" He was also a good debater on subjects of God and religion and proved his atheistic views and this attitude continued for five years. Then his young daughter died suddenly which plunged him to immense grief and self-reflection and attitude towards God. He tried to look for solace in the Brahmo, Christian, and Hindu religious faiths but his \\"The great inquiry\\" of God did not seem to end. He then, on 13 November 1879, visited Ramakrishna for the first time at Dakshineshwar along with his friend Gopal Chandra Mittra and Manomohan Mittra, a cousin. This was the turning point in his life and he thereafter became a staunch devotee of Ramakrishna to the extent that he considered him as an Avatar of God and started propagating his message through lectures in later years. Ramakrishna visited Ram's house on 2 June 1886 which was a full moon day of the month of Vaisakh according to Bengali calendar, which became a festival day for Ram as he felt blessed on this occasion. Spiritual life Ram Chandra Datta was a householder disciple of Ramakrishna, the Master. His dedication and love for the Master was obsessively evident that he vehemently asserted that any place visited by the master was holy including the coach and the coachman which carried him around. During 1882-86 there were two groups of disciples of Ramakrishna - The \\"Householder Group\\" (married group) to which Ram Chandra Datta belonged, and the \\"Renouncer Group\\" to which his cousin Narendra Nath Datta (who later became Swami Vivekananda) belonged and there was a cultural conflict between these two groups. This was brought out by Datta in his book Kathamrata when he stated : \\"He (Ramakrishna) did not talk about the renouncer disciples in the presence of the householder disciples, and he did not talk about the householder disciples in the presence of the renouncer disciples. But sometimes he would criticize both groups when both were present. They would chastise one another. In this way there was a feeling of hostility (virabhava) between these two groups.\\" Ramachandra's devotion to the master was so deep rooted that after Ramakrishna‚Äôs death on 16 August 1886 at the Cossipore garden house, after he was cremated on the bank of the Ganga his ashes were collected in an urn, taken from Casipore burning ghat, and kept initially on Ramakrishna‚Äôs bed. At that time, Vivekananda tried to pacify the grieving disciples by narrating Ramakrishna‚Äôs life events of mercy. Ramachandra wished to keep the urn of ashes in his Kankurgachi house but Vivekananda‚Äôs fellow boys played a trick on him, with the consent of Vivekananda, and transferred more than half the ashes to another urn and handed over the original urn to Ramachandra who then kept it in his house on the Krishnajanmashtami day, on 23 August, at Kankurgachi Yogodyana His devotion to Ramakrishna was so intense that he built a temple consecrating the Master‚Äôs relics. He not only offered worship here but also vehemently propagated that Ramakrishna was an incarnation of god, an Avatar. With his gift of spiritual knowledge that he had acquired under the Master, he turned an \\"evangelist\\" and he delivered 18 public lectures between 1893 and 1897 at the Star, City, and Minerva Theaters in Calcutta extolling Sri Ramakrishna‚Äôs life and teachings. His first lecture titled \\"Is Ramakrishna Paramahamsa an Avatar?\\" was delivered on a Good Friday in 1893. Following this he devoted himself to frugal living and made it a ritual to offer worship at the Kankurgachi Yogodyana every day commuting from his Simla home where he lived with his wife and children. In his official life, he exercised utmost discipline in his dealings with the public and suppliers that he refused to accept any kind of favour to overlook any lapses in standards of supplies and delivery. Even in personal life he became so philosophical that when one of his daughters died of burns on 7 December 1886 his stoic and endured reaction was \\"The Lord gave me that daughter and He took her away. Why should I lament?\\" Later life Rama's ascetic life had a telling effect on his health. In 1898, dysentery compounded his problems of chronic diabetes and carbuncle. He was devoutly attended at his Simla home by his wife, friends, and disciples. His health condition further deteriorated with heart disease and chronic asthma and he died on 17 January 1899. His relics are consecrated at Yogodyana adjoining the Sri Ramakrishna‚Äôs temple according to his last wish \\"When I die please bury a little of the ashes of my body at the entrance to Yogodyana. Whoever enters this place will walk over my head, and thus I shall get the touch of the Master‚Äôs devotees‚Äô feet forever.\\"  Relationship with Swami Vivekananda  Ram Chandra Datta was a relative of Swami Vivekananda and persuaded him to go to Dakshineswar and meet Ramakrishna. Ram Chandra was the nephew of Bhuvaneswari Devi, mother of Narendranath Datta. He was twelve years older than Narendranath, but, Bhuvaneswari used to consider him as her another son. Mahendranath Datta, younger brother Narendranath, told, in their childhood they used to think that Ram Chandra was their elder brother. In November 1881, Surendra Mitra's house was the venue of meetings where Ramakrishna was happy to be present and one of his householder disciples present on this occasion was Ram Chandra Datta along with his 16-year-old cousin Narendra Nath Datta who was still a student and he used to sing at such gatherings. Ramakrishna liked the youngster‚Äôs singing and he asked Ram Chandra and Surendra to bring the youngster to his Dakshineswar abode. He was so anxious to meet the young Narendra that he also directly asked Narendra to come and meet him. He was so enamored of Narendra and the effect was so profound which made him cry for six months till Narendra met him. But Narendra took time to meet him as he thought Ramakrishna was a \\"monomaniac\\". In 1898, when Ram Chandra was seriously ill, Swami Vivekananda, after returning from the Western countries, visited Ram Chandra to inquire about his cousin's health. At that time Vivekananda even helped him to wear his slippers to go to the toilet as there was no body else in the room. Ram was so touched by this visit and kind gesture that his eyes watered and he emotionally stated: \\"Bille (Swami Vivekananda‚Äôs family nickname), I thought that after travelling to America and becoming famous you would have forgotten us. But now I see that you are my same little brother Bille.\\" Biographical works In May 1885, Ram's compilation of some of Sri Ramakrishna‚Äôs important teachings was not published immediately as Ramakrishna advised him to delay its publishing as he said \\"Do not publish my biography now. If you do, my body will not last long.\\" Ram complied and later wrote the first biography titled \\"Sri Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansadever Jivanvrittanta\\" which he subsequently expanded in to \\"Tattva- Prakashika\\" (The Teachings of Sri Ramakrishna). At this time he also started publishing a Bengali magazine. In 1890, Ram Chandra wrote the biography of saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa‚Äôs Life and Teachings in which he has used the expression guhya katha meaning \\"secret talk\\" attributed to the saint himself which pertained to secret tantric revelations. Jivanavrrtanta was another book that he wrote. Vivekananda had even threatened to take Ram Chandra to court if he attributed to his name in this book, which was known by the epithet \\"bosh and rot\\".

He had worked as a psychological warfare officer within the United Front Department of the Korean Workers' Party. Jang specifically worked within the United Front Department Section 5 (Literature), Division 19 (Poetry) of Office 101. Office 101 created propaganda intended to encourage South Korean sympathy for North Korea. One of Jang's job duties was to create poetry under a South Korean pseudonym Kim Kyong-min and in a South Korean style. His poetry was intended for distribution within South Korea. Biography Jang claims to have been one of the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's favored propaganda poets. This favoritism occurred after Jang wrote the epic poem Spring Rests on the Gun Barrel of the Lord as part of recurring competitive poetry writing among different North Korean Government departments. Kim Jong Il liked the poem so much it was redistributed in North Korea in 1999. Kim Jong Il's favoritism gained Jang the class status of \\"The Admitted\\" for which Jang received extra food rations and political protections. According to Jang's account, he was forced to flee the country for his life after his friend Hwang Young-Min lost a forbidden book from his department on the Pyongyang Metro. As the North Korean State Security Department pursued them, they obtained a fake travel pass and travelled to the north of the country, where they fled across the frozen Tumen River into China. After a long period of hiding in China, Jang defected to South Korea in 2004 by reaching the embassy in Beijing; however, Young-min separated from him during their escape and while he was awaiting repatraition back to North Korea after being arrested by the Chinese police, Young-min committed suicide to avoid repatriation and retribution from the North Korean authorities for his escape. Young-min's uncle later identified and claimed his body. A few months after arriving in South Korea, in January 2005, Jang became a Senior Analyst for the National Security Research Institute in Seoul, South Korea. The National Security Research Institute is part of the National Intelligence Service of South Korea. In 2010, he left the National Security Research Institute. In 2011, Jang used his severance to start North Korean defectors' magazine New Focus International (Îâ¥Ìè¨Ïª§Ïä§). The magazine aims to report on North Korean news without North Korean media restrictions. As of 2013, the North Korean government still threatens the life of Jang Jin-sung through statements made through the North Korea controlled media.

The largest Sammarinese-American communities are in Michigan, mostly in the cities of Troy and Detroit. Sammarinese immigrants in Troy established institutions such as the San Marino Club and Re Monti Stentorian.  History  Until the early twentieth century, few people from San Marino emigrated in the United States. However, the number of Sammarinese immigrants in the US increased significantly, with most emigrating to the United States to escape poverty, carrying with them expectations of social and economic improvement. Most of the immigrants who arrived after the First World War emigrated because they had relatives there, and acquired jobs through them. Between those years, the United States imposed several restrictive laws against immigration, such as the Quota Act (promulgated in 1921), which regulated the entry of immigrants by limiting their numbers by quota (the number of allowed immigrants from San Marino to US was at maximum 100). In the first Quota Act, Sammarinese migrants were counted in the Italian quota, however after 1924 San Marino was recognized as an independent European state. The immigrants had to undergo medical examinations to verify physical and mental fitness. This set of obligations and limits together with the effects of the 1929 crash, reduced the number of Sammarinese emigrants. During these years, most Sammarinese emigrated to New York City and Detroit, as well as Sandusky, Ohio. Most Sammarinese then worked as dishwashers and tilers. In addition, Sammarinese women began to work out of their homes from the 50s and 60s as textile workers, working in both the factory and home.  Press and associations  On September 3, 1929 the newspaper San Marino in New York, bringing news of that country, was first published. Several migrant associations of San Marino in the United States that aimed to help their compatriots in various aspects of their lives: the mortgage, illness, care among members and families, and maintaining traditions. Sammarinese associations include Club San Marino Social, founded in 1938 in Troy, and the San Marino Community of New York.

It marks the supposed site of the 1403 Battle of Shrewsbury fought between King Henry IV and English rebel nobleman Henry Percy.  History  The Battle of Shrewsbury is remembered as one of the bloodiest battles in English history and was fought between King Henry IV (with support from his son Henry Prince of Wales, later to become Henry V) and the rebel Henry Percy (commonly called Harry Hotspur). Battlefield Church ‚Äì also known as St Mary Magdalene ‚Äì was built in the fifteenth century to commemorate the battle. A 1995 report by English Heritage noted that it is unclear if Battlefield Church, which was completed in 1410, marks the centre of the site of the battle, although a large common grave within the church's foundations would suggest the site was associated with the fighting. The church was built at the request of Henry IV, reportedly: \\"for the souls of those who fell\\". The now redundant church and surrounding earthworks are a scheduled ancient monument. The church contains some visitor information. The area considered to be the site of the battle remains almost completely undeveloped, although in use as agricultural land and enclosed by hedges. The A5124 runs near the southern boundary.  Visitor facilities and information centre  Information panels are provided around the site. An exhibition centre known as Battlefield 1403 opened in 2008 close to the church, and includes a caf√© and farm shop.

It is the plaza that fronts the Minor Basilica of San Lorenzo Ruiz (Binondo Church), one of the main churches of the City of Manila, and is considered the center of Binondo as a whole. Originally called the Plaza de Binondo, and then Plaza Carlos IV after Charles IV of Spain, the plaza was eventually renamed Plaza Calder√≥n de la Barca (often shortened to Plaza Calder√≥n), after the famous Spanish playwright. It is believed that the plaza may have been renamed after Calder√≥n either by the then-sitting Governor-General, or by the Dominican friars who were at the time running the Binondo Church, who had adored his works. The plaza was renamed after Lorenzo Ruiz, one of the Martyrs of Japan and the protomartyr of the Philippines, on September 12, 1981, by virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 133.Republic of the Philippines. (Enacted: September 12, 1981). Batas Pambansa Blg. 133 - An Act to Rename Plaza Calderon de la Barca and the San Fernando Bridge, Both Located in Binondo, Manila, as Plaza Lorenzo Ruiz and Lorenzo Ruiz Bridge, Respectively, In Honor of the Filipino Proto-martyr. Retrieved July 4, 2013 from the Chan Robles Virtual Law Library. History In 1594, the town of Binondo was established on the northern bank of the Pasig River by then Governor-General G√≥mez P√©rez Dasmari√±as as a settlement for Chinese migrants arriving in Manila. With urban planning not as strict as that of Intramuros, compounded by the geography of the newly established settlement which is bounded by numerous streams which drain into the Pasig River, Plaza San Lorenzo Ruiz was created to serve as the largest plaza of the settlement, directly fronting the Binondo Church. Similar to Plaza Moriones in Tondo, the plaza was originally an open grass field. During the Spanish colonial period, the plaza was a hub for economic activity, and was even described by Teodoro Agoncillo as \\"one of the most impressive open spaces of old Manila\\". The plaza was surrounded by trees and tipped with two large fountains, both of which still stand today. With the completion of the Binondo Church in 1854, trade around the area increased, and several large buildings and mansions were built around the plaza. Economic activity continued to grow in Binondo during American rule, and the plaza was a busy center of activity alongside other major plazas in Manila. The plaza was also well-served by Manila's pre-World War II tram network. While the plaza was spared from the Battle of Manila in 1945, and economic activity in Binondo recovered thereafter, the area around the plaza started declining around the 1960s, when most business activity shifted from Manila to Makati and Cubao in Quezon City. By the 1980s, the plaza (and the area in general) was in serious decline, even becoming a repository for monuments moved from nearby Plaza Cervantes and Plaza Goiti (now Plaza Lacson), which were cleared to make room for parking space. In 1990, the Manila City Council passed an ordinance prohibiting parking around the immediate vicinity of the plaza in a bid to alleviate chronic traffic congestion.City of Manila. (Promulgated: September 14, 1990). An Ordinance Declaring the Immediate Surrounding of Certain Plazas and Circles as Non- Parking Areas for All Kinds of Land Transportation; and Providing Penalty for Violation Thereof. Retrieved July 5, 2013 from the Manila Standard. In 2005, Plaza San Lorenzo Ruiz was redeveloped by the Manila city government during the tenure of Lito Atienza, with help from the Metrobank Foundation, which donated ‚Ç±3 million for the project. Another redevelopment was completed in 2014, under the tenure of Joseph Estrada. Architecture =Design and layout= Plaza San Lorenzo Ruiz has an area of , which unlike other plazas in Manila is shaped like an ellipse, with a fountain on each end. The plaza is paved with granite tiles and multicolored interlocking concrete bricks, similar to Plaza Miranda in Quiapo. Park benches have been installed around the plaza's perimeter, and a number of royal palm trees have been planted in the plaza's center, complementing a number of existing narra trees. The plaza is lit at night with 42 promenade lampposts, 32 floodlights and 24 uplights that have been installed at strategic points around the area. Previously, a perimeter fence circled around the plaza: this was removed in the 2005 redevelopment. A number of historical markers have been installed at the plaza, two of which are centuries-old. The most notable marker is a statue of Lorenzo Ruiz which in the 2005 rehabilitation was repositioned to face the Binondo Church. Behind the statue of Lorenzo Ruiz is a memorial to Chinese Filipino victims of World War II erected in 1995 by the Confederation of Filipino Chinese Veterans. At the northern end of the plaza is an obelisk dating back to 1916 which was erected in memory of Tomas Pinpin, the first Filipino printer, which was moved to the plaza from Plaza Cervantes in 1979, when it was cleared to make room for more parking space. At the southern end of the plaza is a monument to Joaquin Santa Marina, the founder of the La Insular Cigar and Cigarette Factory.

The largest building to have been built around the plaza was the La Insular Cigar and Cigarette Factory, which was opened in 1883 after the lifting of the Spanish tobacco monopoly three years earlier. Destroyed by fire during the Battle of Manila, the site is now occupied by the Wellington Building, which was once the headquarters of the Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (Metrobank), founded by Chinese Filipino businessman George Ty, and still home to the Binondo offices of a number of Metrobank-affiliated companies. Beside it was the Hotel de Oriente, then the most popular hotel in Manila, where Jos√© Rizal stayed in Room 22, and which also served as the erstwhile headquarters of the National Library of the Philippines. While the Hotel de Oriente, unlike the La Insular Cigar and Cigarette Factory, was only partially destroyed in the Battle of Manila, it was demolished afterward, and the site is now occupied by Tytana Plaza, home to the current Binondo offices of Metrobank. A replica of the Hotel de Oriente today stands in the Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar complex in Bagac, Bataan. On the northern end of the plaza is a building formerly housing the Binondo offices of Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), which is currently home to the Binondo branches of Pancake House, Starbucks and Yellow Cab Pizza. While the Binondo branch has moved to a taller building next door, at the corner with Reina Regente Street, BPI currently maintains its main Binondo offices at the BPI Building along Quintin Paredes Street.

It became the ODC-T in 1994. After Turkey joined NATO in 1952, JAMMAT became the largest of the United States European Commands (USEUCOM). History After the British government declared on 21 February 1947 its inability to provide financial aid (though she would establish the Central Treaty Organization a decade later), Turkey turned towards the United States, who drew up the Truman Doctrine, pledging to \\"support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures\\". $100 million was appropriated two months after the US Congress ratified the Truman Doctrine on 12 March 1947. This figure was raised to $233 million by 1950, after Turkey contributed a brigade of about 5000 men to the United Nations forces in the Korean War. In August 1947, the Joint American Military Mission for Aid to Turkey (JAMMAT) was established in Ankara under the authority of the US ambassador. On 5 October 1947, a delegation of senior Turkish military officials traveled to the United States to establish the military framework of the co-operation agreement.Ecevit Kƒ±lƒ±√ß, √ñzel Harp Dairesi: T√ºrkiye'nin Gizli Tarihi, quoted in After joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) on 18 February 1952, Turkey signed a Military Facilities Agreement on 23 June 1954, paving the way for a large scale US military presence.

On the political front, AFAR, working closely with the Association of Hunt Saboteurs and others, were instrumental in the banning of the Ward Union Stag Hunt in 2010, and supported the Irish Green Party during its terms as a coalition partner in government in Ireland (2007-2011).

The camp was one of nine established by the French in the Sahara, primarily for dissidents, but from 1940 to 1942 it was used as an internment camp for British Empire servicemen,Simon Ball, The Bitter Sea: the struggle for mastery in the Mediterranean 1939‚Äî1945, p. 186 under the name Camp des intern√©s britanniques Laghouat (\\"British Internees Camp Laghouat\\").'News from the Sahara' in Prisoners of War News, vol. 3 (1942), p. 111 After these men were freed by Allied forced in November 1942, the camp was again used for North African internees, of whom many were communists and Jews. Internment camp for British and Commonwealth forces Following the British Attack on Mers-el-K√©bir (and elsewhere) against the French fleet on 3 July 1940, there was a state of war between Britain and Vichy France. From July 1940 until shortly after the Allied invasion of French North Africa on 8 November 1942, Laghouat was used as a de facto prisoner-of-war camp for British Empire and Commonwealth prisoners, mostly captured sailors and airmen.Allan S.

He refused to give information to the Allies about those detained, or even to reveal the numbers involved, but British and American investigations in 1943 suggested that the total of detainees in the nine camps was then about 7,500, of whom a large number were described by the French authorities as communists.

It was written by Gordon J. Key and published by The Fourth Dimension. The game was released on a single 3.5\\" floppy disc. Gameplay The game involved racing against 11 AI cars around circuits for a set number of laps (between 1 and 99), aiming to finish ahead of as many as possible. All cars were of the same generic design but featured differing simple colour schemes. As the game was unlicensed driver names were created for the game, based on puns (Ali Rimms, Terbie Blower, Cruncher Gears, Torson Barrs, Eeza Weaver, Wilson Phyre), though actual circuits were used. The game had three modes - Fun, Race and Championship. The former allowed racing with any permutation of laps, car modifications, invincibility etc.; the latter a set series of races with a points-scoring system. Race mode effectively created a non-championship race. Colliding with another car would penalise the player in that his car would stand still for a few seconds and the rival would continue; colliding with a barrier head-on on either Race or Championship modes would result in the destruction of the player's car. Limited mechanical failures were also incorporated into the game, as was tyre wear - while the game featured no pit stops choosing soft compound tyres for a long race would result in a loss of grip. The car had a limited number of modification options, including engine size, tyre type, gearbox type, steering ratio, wing positioning etc. Some of these options - such as \\"Va-Voom\\" engines, Pythonesque steering (which made the car do the opposite to the gamer's mouse movements) and limpet tyres were only available on Fun mode. The game featured no testing/practice option, with grid positions chosen at random and the Fun mode intended for learning of circuits. The game's pause screen featured a track map informing the player of his position and those of the other cars. While the game was unlicensed it did feature primitive recreations of numerous circuits used for Formula 1 races, including Monaco, Silverstone, Brands Hatch, Hockenheim, Paul Ricard, Adelaide, Detroit, Suzuka, Spa, the Hungaroring, Montreal, Buenos Aires, Interlagos - plus Wellington in New Zealand. Twelve of the sixteen featured circuits would be chosen at random and in a random order for a championship season. Controls As with E-Type the player took control of the car using the mouse. The three Acorn mouse buttons represent (from left) the Clutch, Brake and Accelerator. This adds to the \\"realism\\" of the game as this corresponds to the typical layout of the car's foot pedals. Keyboard keys were used for gear changes (in Manual or Electronic gearbox mode).

Background Thomas Grissell (1801‚Äì1874) had originally been apprenticed to his uncle, Henry Peto. Once his apprenticeship was finished Grissell was invited to join his uncle in a partnership.Sir Samuel Morton Peto, Bart, 1809‚Äì1889 by the Revd. Dr. Edward C. Brooks, first chapter, Samuel Morton Peto (1809‚Äì1889), normally known as Morton Peto, had also been apprenticed to his uncle, Henry Peto. His apprenticeship finished a short time before Henry Peto died in 1830. On the death of Henry Peto, Thomas Grissell and Morton Peto formed a partnership, Grissell and Peto, that operated between 1830 and 1847. Contracts undertaken The first contract that Grissell and Peto won was for the rebuilding of Hungerford Market at Charing Cross in the Strand, London. At the time Peto was only 21 years old and his youthful appearance seems to have caused some concern amongst the committee considering the tenders. Peto met with the committee when the tenders were opened and Grissell and Peto found to be the lowest by ¬£400. The Earl of Devon, the chairman of the committee, asked Peto to leave the room, and on being recalled the Earl informed him that the committee were greatly concerned about giving such an important contract to so young a man. Peto replied that if they wished he would fetch his partner, who looked old enough for anything; adding that is his youthful looks were a problem, he would, ‚Äútake to wearing spectacles, or adopt some other mode of giving myself an appearance of increased age.‚ÄùSir Morton Peto, A Memorial Sketch (1893) by Henry Peto, reprint by Kissinger Publishing LLP, Peto wrote: > ‚ÄúWe have very much to contend with ‚Äî a large business and circumscribed > capital present many discouraging circumstances; but you know we must ‚ÄòPress > Forward‚Äô (the motto of the Grissell family). We have made a tender for the > Hungerford Market ‚Äî our amount was ¬£42,400; it was accepted; but we do not > feel dismayed, the payments are very good ‚Äî three-fourths every three > months, and two years to complete it in.‚Äù The early difficulties of the firm were overcome. Their first contract proved a very remunerative one, and they became one of the most important building firms in the kingdom. Writing nearly 40 years later, Peto recalled, ‚ÄúA building business is a very good one if a man thoroughly knows it. When I was with Mr. Grissell, our ordinary business coming regularly from the large breweries and fire offices, and the work of our own connection with the architects, netted on the average ¬£11,000 to ¬£12,000 a year, and with only ¬£50,000 capital engaged in that department.‚Äù Grissell and Peto went on to build many other well-known buildings in London, including the Reform Club, the Oxford & Cambridge Club, the Lyceum, St James's Theatre and Hungerford Market. In addition, they built Nelson's Column (1843) and the vast infrastructure project of the London Brick Sewer. As the demand for railways grew, Grissell and Peto undertook a great deal of railway construction, including: * the section of the Great Western Railway between Hanwell to Langley, apart from the embankment, * the section of the Great Western Railway between Reading and Goring, * Paddington Station and Reading Station, * a large portion of the South-Eastern Railway; * the Eastern Counties Railway' The last contracts that Grissell and Peto took on were for the new Houses of Parliament. Starting in 1840, the first contract was for the range of buildings fronting the River Thames, along with the Speaker's residence and the libraries. The second contract was for the Houses of Lords and Commons, the Great Central Hall, the Victoria Hall, the Royal Gallery, and House of Commons offices. The third contract was for St. Stephen's Hall and Porch. Termination of the partnership The partnership was very successful but Grissell did not like the risks and the heavy financial commitment involved in the large railway contracts although they had mostly been very profitable, while Peto felt that the profitability of the railway contracts out-weighed the risks. During the work on the Houses of Parliament, Grissell and Peto agreed to dissolved their partnership, with the formal break taking place on 2 March 1846. Grissell took over the building business, saw-mills, and premises, and also the River Severn Improvement contract. Peto took over the railway works: *a contract on the South Eastern Railway, including the Folkestone Viaduct and about 12 miles of bridges and earthworks, *the Ely and Peterborough and Norfolk Railway contracts, *the Southampton to Dorchester section of the London and South-Western Railway. Peto wrote: > \\"These three contracts will just occupy me enough to thoroughly interest me. > All my stock-in-trade will be ¬£25,000 of plant, and all the rest clear > capital ... Mr. Grissell would stand with our stock-in-trade and plant of > ¬£150,000, including houses built and building for the firm, and, besides, he > will have a large and abundant capital in money; but, then, mine being all > in money but the ¬£25,000, I shall have it clear and ready for using, or > taking on some one or two large railway works, and nothing else, which will > only half occupy my time, and then the power of capital will always, with my > previous experience, give me a preference without my being known as a > competitor to anyone.\\" That year Peto formed a partnership with Edward Betts, known as Peto and Betts. Previously, Grissell and Peto had been working on the Hythe to Folkestone section of the South Eastern Railway and the contract for the ballasting and permanent way between Reigate and Folkestone had been undertaken by Betts. In 1842 Grissell and Peto had difficulties with the Saltwood Tunnel and both companies agreed to finish the tunnel together. Later Betts married Peto's sister, Ann. Aftermath It was later found that once the final accounts of Grissell and Peto were completed, Peto should have received an additional ¬£5,000. Grissell wished to make the payment but Peto refused. Years later, Peto died while in dire financial difficulties. Grissell, by a codicil to his will, left the ¬£5,000 to Peto's eldest son.

Johnson is an American political scientist who studies the evolutionary origins of political behavior. Johnson has argued that government and politics are natural phenomena found widely in nature. He has likewise argued that patriotism is a functional necessity in any stable biological or social system, and that patriotism is generated in large-scale human societies through the orchestration of psychological mechanisms that evolved originally under very different conditions. He says that loyalty to ethnic groups‚Äîas well as the nationalism that often grows out of such loyalty‚Äîis achieved through orchestrating these same mechanisms. Johnson served as Editor of Politics and the Life Sciences from 1991 to 2001 and as Executive Director of the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences from 1996 to 2001. In the latter capacity, he organized association conferences in Boston, Atlanta, Washington DC, and Charleston. He also served in 2012-13 as President of the Michigan Political Science Association, which honored him in 2016 with its Founders Award for service to the association and contributions to the discipline. Born in Shenandoah, Iowa in 1949, Johnson earned a B.A. in Political Science at Augustana College, Rock Island, Illinois (1972) and a Master of Arts (1975) and Ph.D. (1979) in Political Science at the University of Cincinnati. He became convinced in graduate school that political science did not understand why humans are political animals. That prompted him to branch out into anthropology and evolutionary biology. Johnson is Professor Emeritus of Political Science at Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, where his academic career extended from 1978 to 2015.

Louis Bouquet was born in Lyon on 6 December 1885. He attended the √âcole nationale des beaux-arts de Lyon and then the √âcole des beaux-arts in Paris. He was taught by Fernand Cormon, and worked with the Nabi painter Maurice Denis. He exhibited his paintings at the Salon d'Automne, the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants and the Tuileries. His work includes portraits, nudes, genre scenes, biblical and literary scenes and allegorical subjects. He made several paintings of Orpheus. He also illustrated books. He visited Tunisia in 1919, where he became acquainted with Islamic art. Bouquet created two frescos for the Palace of the Colonies, or the Palais de la Porte Dor√©e, for the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition. In style they are reminiscent of the Orientalism of the previous century, which was again in vogue. Although the murals are strong artistic works, they are unquestioning in their acceptance of France's colonial destiny. The murals remain, although the building now houses the Cit√© nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration. Bouquet created a painting named Souvenir du Mus√©e des Colonies that depicts the men who worked on the pavilion: the architects Albert Laprade and L√©on Bazin, the sculptor Alfred Janniot, the decorator Jacques-√âmile Ruhlmann and himself. The painting also includes an anonymous black woman wearing only a skirt, resembling Josephine Baker, who represents the indigenous colonial people. Bouquet often worked with the architect Michel Roux-Spitz during the inter-war period. For Roux-Spitz's H√¥tel des Postes on the Place Antonin-Poncet in Lyon he contributed a huge mural long and covering about of the lobby wall. The mural was created between 1935 and 1938 while the hotel was being built. It allegorically represents the global connections of the city of Lyon, connected by radio waves to cities around the world, and depicts the modernity of the city, with airplanes, ships, trains, hydroelectricity and industry, and everywhere youth. In reality, Lyon was suffering economically at the time, and the mural represented an optimistic view of the city as it would like to be seen. Louis Bouquet died in Saint-Rambert-l'√éle-Barbe, Lyon on 25 February 1952.

Intended as a heavier, trimotor version of the PWS-22 and submitted along with it to the Polish Ministry of Military Affairs in 1929, it was intended as a possible replacement for outdated Farman Goliath and improvised Fokker F.VII bombers in use by the Polish Army at the time. It was created in two possible configurations: the PWS-23 B3N (B3N being an acronym for \\"bomber, trimotor, night\\") and PWS-23T (T for transport). However, both designs were rejected along with the PWS-22, and the PWS-23 remained on paper only.  History  In the early 1920s the Polish Army was seeking home-made \\"retribution bombers\\", that is heavy bombers in modern terminology. However, all proposals by Polish aircraft manufacturers were rejected as none were deemed skilled and experienced enough to build large, complicated bombers. Because of that the newly created 2nd Destroyer Squadron of the 1st Air Regiment in 1926 was equipped with 32 Farman Goliath bombers bought in France. However soon it became clear that the French bomber, designed in 1918, was already obsolete. Furthermore, the Goliaths were seriously underpowered and could not fly on one engine only, a serious flaw in a bomber. Because of that the Department of Air of the Ministry of Military Affairs renewed interest in a home-produced heavy bomber. As a stop-gap solution, the Polish state bought in February 1928 a license for Fokker F.VIIB/3m long-range passenger aircraft to be produced at the Lublin-based Plage i La≈õkiewicz works. By the end of that year Jerzy Rudlicki of Plage i La≈õkiewicz modified the design to build the plane in bomber configuration as well: windows were sealed, the passenger cabin replaced with bomb racks for up to bombs and a single dorsal machine gun nest. The plane, while mechanically sound, was but a stop-gap solution and the Polish Ministry of Military Affairs continued to seek a full-featured replacement for the Goliaths. Meanwhile the LOT Polish Airlines were seeking a modern passenger plane to replace its ageing fleet of Junkers F.13 and Fokker F.VIIB/3m, and PWS-23T was presented to the Department of Aeronautics to compete with the T-600 design by State Aviation Works in June 1928. PWS' design was more complicated than its competitor, but provided accommodation for up to 20 passengers and of cargo, twice as much as the competitor. In the end however the T-600 was accepted and a single prototype was built for evaluation under the new PZL.4 designation. The night bomber shared a similar fate. In 1929 Plage i La≈õkiewicz presented the ministry with a much heavier \\"flying fortress\\" Lublin R-XVIII design, while PWS sent two projects: PWS-22 and PWS-23. Eventually all designs were rejected and the unsuccessful LWS-6 ≈ªubr was chosen as an interim design before the modern PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ could be introduced in the 1930s. The PWS-23 remained a project only.  Technical description  The PWS-23 was a high parasol wing aircraft of mixed construction, with a fixed undercarriage. A geodetic airframe of welded steel or aluminium tubing was to be covered with plywood and canvas. The wooden parasol wings reinforced with two girders were attached to the fuselage with a pyramid-like mounting. Defensive armament included 5 machine guns, including two in a double nose mount, 2 in a double dorsal mount and 1 in a ventral retractable turret. The bombload was to exceed . The avionics included a radio, electric installation for night flights and cabin heating for the crew. Both the bomber and transport versions were to be powered by three Bristol Jupiter IV 9Asb engines of , including two tractors and one pusher.

Life C A Coppy Laws was born in Great Yarmouth on 21 November 1916. In 1931 his father died, and the 14-year-old Cecil was boarded with a school friend's family, and came to terms with his loss by immersing himself in radio, his childhood hobby. He built the first TV in the street, and neighbours would crowd in to see the one hour of weekly broadcasting transmitted by the BBC. There was no money for further education, so he worked in a local shop recharging lead-acid accumulators for radios by day, and cycling 16 miles to evening classes and back, five nights a week for four years. This determination won him a first-class City and Guilds examination in radio communications. In 1936, aged 20, Laws took a job at Philco. He had striking, copper-coloured hair, and a young secretary, Rita Hay, coined the nickname 'Coppy'. Coppy and Rita were married in 1942.Pat Williams Obituary of Coppy Laws, Independent newspaper, London, England, 4 June 2002 The couple had five sons. He died on 28 May 2002. Work In his mid-twenties he designed a range-finding system which allowed guns to home in on enemy ships beyond the horizon with accuracy and to fire a salvo the instant they were detected. His achievements won recognition from the British Government in the form of a large cash award, similar to that given to Sir Frank Whittle, inventor of the jet engine. At the outbreak of war he was seconded to the Admiralty to work on the development of radar. He resolved the key component of a design for a radar distance-measuring oscillator, a problem which at the time was defeating the young Herman Bondi and Fred Hoyle, part of the mathematical team backing up the radar designers. After the war he was invited to form a radar division for Elliotts, the electrical engineering company. He helped create the East coast radar defence for the USA; set up Elliotts' first automation division; automated the oil pipelines in Saudi Arabia for Aramco; and initiated and directed the first computer division.Simon Lavington, Moving Targets, Chapter 2-page 38, CDS project. Publication Date: 23 February 2011 Following the merger of Elliotts with GEC he left, not to take early retirement but to form his own business in the obscure field of electrical medicine. According to Rosalind Tan (Co-author Mr Joshua Shaw) in her book The Truth About Air Electricity & Health, CA Laws had found out during his work on torpedoes for the Royal Navy that the German U-boats could stay under water longer and the crew stayed healthy because the air inside the U-boats was ionised.Rosalind Tan The Truth About Air Electricity and Health Trafford Publishing, 2014, , 9781490700595 These U-boats were using the Chizhevsky Chandelier. In 1918 Alexander Chizhevsky had created the first air ioniser for ion therapy. This discovery was what had ignited his interest in the little-known phenomenon of air ionisation, and with Idries Shah as co-director he formed Medion (not the German electronics company). Airtone Medion Ioniser International portable model Development of the domestic air ioniser Funding all the research himself, he developed the world's first effective home air ioniser. In the decades that followed, he became an international expert in electro-medical science. Other machines came on the market, all based on versions of his patents, but his instruments set the standard. After Medion he set up a more modern company with his sons Julian and Keith which had hospital superbugs in its sight. The sons collaborated in a famed epidemiological university study at St James's University Hospital in Leeds, where it was said that: \\"Repeated airborne infections of the bacteria acinetobacter in an intensive care ward have been eliminated by the installation of a negative air ioniser.\\" The results were encouraging and an article in New Scientist quoted Stephen Dean, a consultant at St James's Hospital in Leeds where the trial took place as saying: \\"The results have been fantastic ‚Äì so much so that we have asked the university to leave the ionisers with us.\\" However, these trials did not help the product that Laws had invented and painstakingly refined and the company Air Ion Technologies went out of business during the financial crisis of 2007. In 2009 the experiments were repeated at the University of London, the London Bioscience Innovation Centre, by Retroscreen Virology Ltd. under the supervision of Prof. John S. Oxford, who is also the chairman of the Hygiene Council. The results were just as encouraging. However this time the scientists were using the Japanese manufacturer Sharp's Plasmacluster Ion Technology. . This technology incorporates ion generators which output both negative and positive ions. Coppy Laws' ideas about the therapeutic effects of negative ions seem to have been lost in these experiments especially as the new machines generate both negative and positive ions. With the exception of the work by Mr Joshua Shaw of Bionic Products Pty Ltd (distributed by Bionic Air Pty Ltd) whose devices (called Elanra) continue in the market since 1967, and amongst other incorporated sciences of Plasma Medicine and Quantum Physics continue to create small negatively charged air ions. His were the first in the world medically registered for their therapeutic benefits to humanity since the early 1970's.
