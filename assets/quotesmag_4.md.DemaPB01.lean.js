United States, 408 A.2d 364 (D.C. 1979) is a landmark case in which District of Columbia Court of Appeals decided that a judge could not impose an insanity defense over the defendant's objections. Circumstances Paula Frendak shot a coworker. After four competency hearings, the defendant was adjudicated competent, although in the opinion of several experts she was likely insane when she committed the crime. However, Frendak refused to use the insanity defense as she felt a hospital was worse than any prison. She attempted suicide, went on hunger strikes and refused medication to underscore her protests. However, she was forced by the court to plead insanity. Thus, in this case a competent defendant was not allowed to reject the use of the insanity defense. Decision On appeal the decision was reversed. The judge may not impose the insanity defense upon an unwilling defendant if an intelligent defendant voluntarily wishes to forgo the defense. The court said that a defendant may feel hospital is worse than prison, that the term of incarceration may be longer, that the stigma and legal consequences of a criminal or an insanity defenses are different. Using the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in North Carolina v. Alford and Faretta v. California, the court concluded that The court listed several disadvantages to choosing the insanity defense, including: #an insanity acquittal may increase the period of confinement over a prison sentence #better treatment may be received in a prison than a mental hospital #the defendant may want to avoid the stigma associated with a mental disorder #commitment may result in loss of other rights, such as a driver's license #the defendant may regard the crime as a political or religious act The court therefore limited any further competence inquiry to an evaluation of the defendant's specific competency to waive the insanity defense. Significance This decision examines the quality of the defendant's decision. If the defendant appears to be intelligently and voluntarily waiving the insanity defense, the trial court should not deny this. However, the trial court should look into whether the defendant has been properly informed of the effects of their decision as well as the alternatives available to them. Thus the nature of such an evaluation would be similar to a competency to stand trial evaluation. The Frendak rationale, that a judge may not impose a sanity defense over the objections of the defendant, has been used mostly in federal cases. Some states have endorsed less elaborate procedures. For example, if a judge rules that the waiver of the insanity defense is not voluntary and informed, yet nonetheless the defense is imposed over the defendant's objections, then a separate counsel must be appointed to argue issues pertaining to insanity issues, while the defendant's counsel presents the arguments the defendant desires. However, as of 2002, seventeen jurisdictions permitted an insanity defense to be entered over the objections of the defendant. Thus these jurisdictions are, in effect, saying that a defendant who has been found competent to stand trial is not competent to rationally select his trial plea. Therefore a separate competency to refuse the insanity defense would have to be held that is similar to an evaluation of the defendant's mental state at the time of the offense. Realistically, because of the Supreme Court's holding in Godinez v. Moran, it is most likely that the court would hold that if a defendant is competent to stand trial, then he is also competent to waive the insanity defense, as the two competencies are equivalent. Godinez v. Moran was modified and refined by the Supreme Court decision in Indiana v. Edwards in 2008.

At the 2001 census, Plean had a population of 1,740. Plean has some historic buildings, some council houses and an estate. Landmarks Plean has a Church of Scotland Church with an attached graveyard, a petrol station, chip shop, a small clinic, small library pub, pharmacy, bakers, Indian takeaway and 3 convenience stores. East Plean Primary School was formerly housed in a traditional building dating from 1874. Many of the original features of the building were retained in the refurbishment of the school, which was completed in summer 2000, including the addition of a purpose-built nursery. The school building was damaged beyond repair in November 2010 when a fire was deliberately started in a hut to the rear. The building was subsequently demolished and a new modern school is being built on the site. Andrew Stretton, 18, set fire to a cardboard box in a shed, but the blaze spread to the main building causing serious damage. Stretton was sentenced at Stirling and ordered to carry out 300 hours of community service, and put on probation for two years.  Plean Estate  Ruins of Plean House in Plean Country Park The Plean Estate was once owned by the Earl of Dunmore; he had sold it to the Robert Haldane who was already the owner of the Airthrey Estate in Stirling. It stayed in the Haldane family until it was sold in 1799 to Francis Simpson, a former captain with the East India Company. Simpson's wife Jean Sophia Cadell, daughter of William Cadell of Banton, was only twenty-one when she died in 1806, she left behind two children for Simpson to look after; one son, William, and a daughter, Frances. In 1819, Francis built Plean House and the other estate buildings. William Simpson's Home is a local charity based in Plean, established by Francis Simpson, providing residential social care for men with alcohol-related brain damage, and with underlying mental health illness. Plean Country Park is located in Plean, in the grounds of the now-ruined Plean House. Entry is free and the park is maintained by Stirling Council.

The generic \\"hero-as-fool\\" story is so old and is expressed in the literature of so many cultures that scholars have hypothesized that it may be Indo-European in origin. A Scandinavian version of the story of Hamlet (called Amleth or Amlóði, which means \\"mad\\" or \\"not sane\\" in Old Norse) was put into writing around 1200 AD by Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in his work Gesta Danorum (the first full history of Denmark). It is this work Shakespeare borrowed from to create Hamlet. Similar accounts are found in the Icelandic Saga of Hrolf Kraki and the Roman legend of Lucius Junius Brutus, both of which feature heroes who pretend to be insane in order to get revenge. A reasonably accurate version of Saxo's story was translated into French in 1570 by François de Belleforest in his Histoires Tragiques. Belleforest embellished Saxo's text substantially, almost doubling its length, and introduced the hero's melancholy. After this point, the ancestry of Shakespeare's version of Hamlet becomes more difficult to trace. Many literary scholars believe that Shakespeare's main source was an earlier play—now lost—known today as the Ur- Hamlet. Possibly written by Thomas Kyd, the Ur-Hamlet would have been in performance by 1589 and was seemingly the first to include a ghost in the story. Using the few comments available from theatre-enthusiasts at the time, scholars have attempted to trace exactly where the Ur-Hamlet might have ended and the play popular today begins. A few scholars have suggested that the Ur- Hamlet is an early draft of Shakespeare's, rather than the work of Kyd. Regardless of the mysteries surrounding the Ur-Hamlet, though, several elements of the story changed. Unlike earlier versions, Shakespeare's Hamlet does not feature an omniscient narrator of events and Prince Hamlet does not appear to have a complete plan of action. The play's setting in Elsinore also differs from legendary versions. Scandinavian legend The story of the prince who plots revenge on his uncle (the current king) for killing his father (the former king) is an old one. Many of the story elements—the prince feigning madness and his testing by a young woman, the prince talking to his mother and her hasty marriage to the usurper, the prince killing a hidden spy and substituting the execution of two retainers for his own—are found in a medieval tale by Saxo Grammaticus called Vita Amlethi (part of his larger Latin work Gesta Danorum), which was written around 1200 AD. Older written and oral traditions from various cultures may have influenced Saxo's work. Amleth (as Hamlet is called in Saxo's version) probably derived from an oral tale told throughout Scandinavia. Parallels can be found with Icelandic legend, though no written version of the original Icelandic tale survives from before the 16th century. Torfaeus, a scholar in 17th-century Iceland, made the connection between Saxo's Amleth and local oral tradition about a Prince Ambales (Amlóði). Torfaeus dismissed the local tradition as \\"an old wive's tale\\" due to its incorporation of fairy-tale elements and quasi-historical legend and Torfaeus' own confusion about the hero's country of origin (not recognizing Cimbria as a name for Denmark). Similarities include the prince's feigned madness, his accidental killing of the king's counsellor in his mother's bedroom, and the eventual slaying of his uncle. The original Amlóði story has been surmised to be derived from a \\"10th-century\\" Old Icelandic poem, but no such poem is known. The \\"hero as fool\\" story has many parallels (Roman, Spanish, Scandinavian and Arabic) and can be classified as a universal, or at least common Indo-European, narrative topos. The Spanish Tragedy, by Thomas Kyd. This popular revenge tragedy may have influenced Hamlet. Its author may have also written the Ur-Hamlet. Influences on Saxo Grammaticus The two most popular candidates for written works that may have influenced Saxo, however, are the anonymous Scandinavian Saga of Hrolf Kraki and the Roman legend of Brutus, which is recorded in two separate Latin works. In Saga of Hrolf Kraki, the murdered king has two sons—Hroar and Helgi—who assume the names of Ham and Hráni for concealment. They spend most of the story in disguise, rather than feigning madness, though Ham does act childishly at one point to deflect suspicion. The sequence of events differs from Shakespeare's as well. In contrast, the Roman story of Brutus focuses on feigned madness. Its hero, Lucius ('shining, light'), changes his name and persona to Brutus ('dull, stupid'), playing the role to avoid the fate of his father and brothers, and eventually slaying his family's killer, King Tarquinius. In addition to writing in the Latin language of the Romans, Saxo adjusted the story to reflect classical Roman concepts of virtue and heroism. A reasonably accurate version of Saxo's story was translated into French in 1570 by François de Belleforest in his Histoires Tragiques. Belleforest embellished Saxo's text substantially, almost doubling its length, and introduced the hero's melancholy. The Ur-Hamlet Shakespeare's main source is believed to be an earlier play—now lost—known today as the Ur-Hamlet. Possibly written by Thomas Kyd, the Ur-Hamlet would have been in performance by 1589, and was seemingly the first to include a ghost in the story. Shakespeare's company, the Chamberlain's Men, may have purchased that play and performed a version, which Shakespeare reworked, for some time. Since no copy of the Ur-Hamlet has survived, it is impossible to compare its language and style with the known works of any candidate for its authorship. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of Hamlet by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea—placing Hamlet far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development—has attracted some support, though others dismiss it as speculation. Francis Meres's Palladis Tamia (published in 1598, probably October) provides a list of twelve named Shakespeare plays, but Hamlet is not among them. This is not conclusive, however, as other then-extant Shakespeare plays were not on Meres' list either. The upshot is that scholars cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare took from the Ur- Hamlet (if it even existed), how much from Belleforest or Saxo, and how much from other contemporary sources (such as Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy). No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxo's version (although its Latin text was widely available at the time). However, elements of Belleforest's version do appear in Shakespeare's play but are not in Saxo's story, so whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly or through the Ur-Hamlet remains unclear. It is clear, though, that several elements did change somewhere between Belleforest's and Shakespeare's versions. For one, unlike Saxo and Belleforest, Shakespeare's play has no all-knowing narrator, thus inviting the audience to draw their own conclusions about the motives of its characters. And the traditional story takes place across several years, while Shakespeare's covers a few weeks. Belleforest's version details Hamlet's plan for revenge, while in Shakespeare's play Hamlet has no apparent plan. Shakespeare also adds some elements that locate the action in 15th-century Christian Denmark instead of a medieval pagan setting. Elsinore, for example, would have been familiar to Elizabethan England, as a new castle had been built recently there, and Wittenberg, Hamlet's university, was widely known for its Protestant teachings. Other elements of Shakespeare's Hamlet absent in medieval versions include the secrecy that surrounds the old king's murder, the inclusion of Laertes and Fortinbras (who offer parallels to Hamlet), the testing of the king via a play, and Hamlet's death at the moment he gains his revenge. Elizabethan court For more than a century, Shakespearean scholars have identified several of the play's major characters with specific members of the Elizabethan court. In 1869, George Russell French theorized that Hamlets Polonius might have been inspired by William Cecil (Lord Burghley)—Lord High Treasurer and chief counsellor to Queen Elizabeth I. French also speculated that the characters of Polonius's children, Ophelia and Laertes, represented two of Burghley's children, Anne and Robert Cecil. In 1930, E. K. Chambers suggested that Polonius's advice to Laertes may have echoed Burghley's to his son Robert, and in 1932, John Dover Wilson commented \\"the figure of Polonius is almost without doubt intended as a caricature of Burleigh, who died on 4 August 1598\\". In 1963, A. L. Rowse said that Polonius's tedious verbosity might have resembled Burghley's, and in 1964, Hurstfield wrote that \\"[t]he governing classes were both paternalistic and patronizing; and nowhere is this attitude better displayed than in the advice which that archetype of elder statesmen William Cecil, Lord Burghley—Shakespeare's Polonius—prepared for his son\\". Lilian Winstanley thought the name Corambis (Polonius' name in the 1st Quarto) suggested Burghley, though Krystyna Kujawinska Courtney has pointed out that the name \\"Corambis\\" translates to \\"reheated cabbage\\" in Latin, i.e. \\"a boring old man\\". In 1921, Winstanley claimed \\"absolute\\" certainty that \\"the historical analogues exist; that they are important, numerous, detailed and undeniable\\" and that \\"Shakespeare is using a large element of contemporary history in Hamlet.\\" She compared Hamlet with both the Earl of Essex and James I. She also identified Polonius with Burghley parallels, and noted a \\"curious parallel\\" in the relationship between Ophelia and Hamlet with that of Burghley's daughter, Anne Cecil, and her husband, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Winstanley noted similar parallels in the relationship of Elizabeth Vernon and Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. Harold Jenkins criticised the idea of any direct personal satire as \\"unlikely\\" and \\"uncharacteristic of Shakespeare\\", while G. R. Hibbard hypothesized that differences in names (Corambis/Polonius; Montano/Raynoldo) between the first quarto and subsequent editions might reflect a desire not to offend scholars at Oxford University, since Polonius was close to the Latin name for Robert Pullen, founder of Oxford University, and Reynaldo too close for safety to John Rainolds, the President of Corpus Christi College. Shakespeare's son Most scholars, including Harold Bloom, dismiss the idea that Hamlet is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, Hamnet Shakespeare, who died at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that Hamlet is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time. However, Stephen Greenblatt has argued that the coincidence of the names and Shakespeare's grief for the loss of his son may lie at the heart of the tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbor after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.

All Lovcom stations are located in the Sheridan Media Radio Center, at 1716 KROE Lane on Sheridan's east side. History KROE first signed on the air on March 18, 1961, with a studio located at 47 South Scott Street in Sheridan. Studios were moved to the former KWYO studio location at 21 North Main Street in 1963, and later to a mobile home East of town on a road known as \\"dump road\\" (because it led to the local landfill). A new building was erected adjacent to the mobile home and transmission tower when the present owner acquired the station in 1974. Along with the larger building the company also added a sister station, KROE-FM, broadcasting at 94.9 MHz. By the 1980s, KROE had increased power from 1,000 Watts to 5,000 Watts, and the road on which it was located had a new name: KROE Lane. The KROE building was renovated in 2001/2002, and as of 2017, houses six radio stations (KROE, KWYO, KLQQ, KOWY, KYTI and KZWY), as well as multiple HD multicast channels and FM translators. Programming In 1983, KROE stopped playing vinyl records and moved to a reel to reel medium. In the 1980s, popular programs included \\"Polka Party\\" featuring polka music and stories delivered in Polish. Another popular program was the \\"Make Believe Ballroom,\\" with 1940s big band sounds. The Polka Party ended in the mid 1990s, and the Big Band show moved to KWYO in 1998. The music on KROE was switched to a Westwood One satellite-delivered country music format in the 1990s. In 1997, station owner Lovcom, Inc. acquired a competing FM station. The call letters of that station were changed from KWYO-FM to KYTI and it became the country music station, while the format on KROE was changed to oldies. Throughout the 80s and 90s, KROE was known for local sports coverage, including live play-by- play of local area football and basketball games. KROE changed formats again in July 2004, this time dropping music in favor of a strictly News Talk Information format. After this format change, the sports coverage was moved to sister station KWYO. Throughout the decades, several long-time programs have remained mostly unchanged and are still heard on KROE, including Swap Shop (an on-air flea market), and the local public affairs call-in program, Public Pulse. The current lineup also includes syndicated political talk show hosts Rush Limbaugh, Michael Medved, Sean Hannity, Joe Paggs, Jim Bohannon and others. KROE is a CBS news affiliate. In January 2017, KROE began rebroadcasting at 103.9 FM on translator K280GK.

It travels from the Chattahoochee River at Georgetown to its eastern terminus southwest of Brunswick. It travels through such cities as Cuthbert, Dawson, Albany, Sylvester, Tifton, Pearson, Waycross, and Nahunta before reaching its eastern terminus. In Georgia, every U.S. Highway has at least one state highway with which it travels concurrently. US 82 uses SR 50 from its western terminus to Dawson and SR 520 from Dawson to its eastern terminus. SR 50 formerly extended across the state and ended in Jekyll Island. In 1981, it was truncated to Dawson, with its former path redesignated as SR 520\\\\. US 82 formerly ended in Midway. In 1989, US 82 and US 84 east of Waycross were swapped. Route description =Georgetown to Albany= US 82 begins at the Alabama state line concurrent with SR 50\\\\. On the Alabama side of the state line, US 82 is concurrent with Alabama State Route 6 (SR 6). On the Georgia side of the state line, US 82/SR 50 head east through Georgetown to an intersection with SR 27/SR 39, where SR 39 begins a concurrency to the southeast. The three highways head southeast until SR 39 splits off to the south. US 82/SR 50 continue to the southeast until they reach an intersection with SR 266, just before entering Cuthbert. In the town, they intersect SR 216\\\\. On the east side of town is US 27/SR 1\\\\. On the extreme northern edge of Shellman is an intersection with SR 41\\\\. Here, they begin a brief concurrency. Just past Graves, SR 45 begins a concurrency until the three routes enter Dawson. In Dawson, there is an intersection with SR 520, where SR 50 ends, the concurrency with SR 45 ends, and the concurrency with SR 520 begins. At this point on to its eastern terminus, US 82 is 4 lane. A short distance later is an intersection with SR 55\\\\. The two highways head southeast until they reach Albany. =Albany to Tifton= At the beginning of Albany, the two highways become a freeway known as Liberty Expressway. At the intersection with US 19/SR 3, which join the concurrency, US 19 Business/US 82 Business/SR 520 Business head south into downtown Albany. At the next exit is SR 91/SR 133\\\\. SR 133 joins the concurrency at this point. The five highways curve to the south, where US 82/SR 520 head east along with SR 300\\\\. Here, US 19/SR 3/SR 133/SR 300 continue south on the expressway. Just east of Albany, SR 300 leaves the concurrency to the northeast. US 82/SR 520 then intersect US 82 Business/SR 520 Business, where they both meet their eastern terminus. The concurrency heads to Sylvester. There, they meet SR 313, SR 33, and SR 112\\\\. The two routes continue easterly to Tifton. =Tifton to Waycross= Just after entering Tifton, the two routes meet I-75, before intersecting US 319/SR 35\\\\. The two highways join the concurrency for about . In the downtown part of the town is US 41/SR 7/SR 125\\\\. After leaving the town, US 319/SR 35 leave the concurrency, while US 82/SR 520 continue to the east-southeast. Prior to entering Alapaha, the concurrent highways intersect US 129/SR 11\\\\. These highways join the concurrency until they leave in town about later. Farther to the east, in Willacoochee, US 82/SR 520 intersect SR 90 and then have a very brief concurrency with SR 135\\\\. In Pearson, the concurrency intersects US 221/US 441/SR 31/SR 64\\\\. SR 64 joins the concurrency for less than . Just prior to entering Waresboro is an intersection with SR 158\\\\. About later, US 1/US 23/SR 4 join the concurrency for about . About after the beginning of the US 1/US 23/SR 4 concurrency is SR 122\\\\. Then, the concurrency enters Waycross. =Waycross to eastern terminus= In Waycross, the concurrency meets US 84/SR 38, which join for about . Approximately later, US 1/US 23/SR 4 depart to the southeast, while US 82/SR 520 head to the east. At this same intersection, US 1 Business/US 23 Business/SR 4 Business head to the northwest. Southeast of Waycross is SR 177, which leads to Laura S. Walker State Park and the Okefenokee Swamp. In Hoboken, is an intersection with SR 15/SR 121\\\\. Farther to the east, in Nahunta is US 301/SR 23\\\\. In Atkinson is an intersection with SR 259 and a very brief concurrency with SR 110\\\\. Approximately later, US 82/SR 520 meet the western terminus of SR 99\\\\. Then, they have an intersection with US 17/SR 25, along with SR 303\\\\. This intersection marks the eastern terminus of US 82 and the southern terminus of SR 303, while US 17/SR 25/SR 520 head southeast. =National Highway System= The entire length of US 82 in Georgia is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. This includes the entire length of SR 50, which is entirely concurrent with US 82 from the Alabama state line to Dawson. History =1920s= The roadway that would eventually become US 82 was established at least as early as 1919 as SR 32 from Dawson through Albany and into Sylvester. It was also designated as SR 46 from Sylvester to Tifton and SR 38 from Waycross, through Blackshear and Jesup, and ended in Hinesville. By the end of 1921, SR 50 was designated from Georgetown through Cuthbert, Dawson, Albany, Sylvester, Tifton, Alapaha, Pearson, Waycross, and Hoboken, and ended at the SR 27 intersection northwest of Brunswick. This truncated SR 32 at Ashburn and absorbed all of SR 46\\\\. Also, the portion of SR 38 northeast of Hinesville was shifted southeast to end at SR 25 east-southeast of Hinesville. By the end of 1926, US 84 was designated on SR 50 east of Waycross. The eastern terminus of US 84/SR 50 was then indicated to be at the US 17/SR 25 northwest of Brunswick. The crossing of the Altamaha River between Jesup and Ludowici was indicated to have \\"no bridge or ferry\\". Two segments of SR 50 had a \\"completed hard surface\\": the eastern part of Albany and west-northwest of Sylvester. Six segments of SR 50 and one segment of SR 38 had a \\"completed semi hard surface\\": the southeastern part of Georgetown, east-southeast of Cuthbert, west-southwest of Dawson, east-southeast of Albany, the Worth County portion of the Sylvester–Tifton segment, west-northwest of Waycross, and from Waycross to Blackshear. Three portions of SR 50 and two segments of SR 38 had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface: from Dawson to a point northwest of Albany, west- northwest of Pearson, west of Nahunta, from Blackshear to a point southwest of Jesup, and the western half of the Hinesville–Midway segment. One segment of SR 50 and two segments of SR 38 were indicated to be under construction: west- northwest of Albany, the Wayne County portion of the Jesup–Ludowici segment, and the eastern half of the Hinesville–Midway segment. By the end of 1929, three segments of SR 50 and one segment of SR 38 had a completed hard surface: the southeast part of Georgetown, from Dawson to a point northwest of Albany, from west-northwest of Waycross into the city, and from Waycross to Blackshear. The segment of SR 38 from Jesup to Ludowici had a completed semi hard surface. Three segments of SR 50 and two segments of SR 38 had a sand clay or top soil surface: southeast of Georgetown, from Cuthbert to Dawson, from west of Nahunta to east-northeast of that city, from about Patterson to about Screven, and from Hinesville to Midway. From about Screven to Jesup, SR 38 had completed grading. Five segments of SR 50 and one segment of SR 38 were indicated to be under construction: from a point northwest of Albany to just south of the Lee–Dougherty county line, the Atkinson county line portion of the Tifton–Pearson segment, west-northwest of Waycross, east-northeast of Waycross, from east-northeast of Nahunta to the eastern terminus of US 84/SR 50, and northeast of Blackshear. =1930s= By the middle of 1930, three segments of SR 50 had a completed hard surface: the entire Terrell County portion except the extreme eastern part, from west of Albany to the Worth–Tift county line, and west-northwest of Waycross. The western half of the Dougherty County portion of the Dawson–Albany segment of SR 50 had a completed semi hard surface. Four segments of SR 50 were indicated to be under construction: a portion straddling the Lee–Dougherty county line, a portion east-southeast of the Berrien–Atkinson county line, a portion east-southeast of the Atkinson–Ware county line, and the Ware County portion of the Waycross–Nahunta segment. By the end of the year, the portion of SR 50 straddling the Lee–Dougherty county line had a completed semi hard surface. The portion of it straddling the Brantley–Glynn county line had completed grading, but no surface course. Four segments of SR 50 and one segment of SR 38 were indicated to be under construction: the western portion in Atkinson County, a portion east-southeast of the Atkinson–Ware county line, from Waycross to just east of the Ware–Brantley county line, the eastern portion of US 84/SR 50, and the Jesup–Ludowici segment. By the end of 1931, the portion of US 84/SR 50 from Waycross to its eastern terminus and the portion of SR 38 from northeast of Pierce–Wayne county line to Jesup had a completed hard surface. Two segments of SR 50 and one segment of SR 38 had a sand clay or top soil surface: a portion east-southeast of Cuthbert, the Alapaha–Pearson segment, and the Jesup–Hinesville segment. One segment each of both highways were indicated to be under construction: a portion west-northwest of Cuthbert and from Blackshear to northeast of the Pierce–Wayne county line. In January 1932, the Dawson–Albany segment had a completed hard surface. In March, a portion east- southeast of Tifton was indicated to be under construction. In August, one portion of each highway was indicated to be under construction: from Pearson to east-southeast of the Atkinson–Ware county line and nearly the entire Hinesville–Midway segment. In September, a portion east-southeast of Tifton had completed grading, but was not surfaced. The western half of the Alapaha–Pearson segment was indicated to be under construction. By the middle of 1933, the portion of SR 50 from Alapaha to a point east-southeast of the Berrien–Atkinson county line and the portion of SR 38 from Blackshear to Ludowici had a completed hard surface. Also the segment of SR 50 from Tifton to Alapaha was under construction. In May, the portion of SR 38 from Ludowici to Hinesville had a completed hard surface. In October, the western half of the Hinesville–Midway segment also had a completed hard surface. In March 1934, the Ware County portion of the Pearson–Waycross segment of SR 50 had a completed hard surface. A portion of the highway west-northwest of Cuthbert had completed grading, but was not surfaced. The eastern half of the Hinesville–Midway segment of SR 38 was under construction. Later that year, two segments of SR 50 and one segment of SR 38 had a completed hard surface: from the Alabama state line to Georgetown, from a point west-northwest of Alapaha to the Berrien–Atkinson county line, and the eastern half of the Hinesville–Midway segment. The Randolph County portion of the Georgetown–Cuthbert segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the middle of 1935, nearly the entire Randolph County portion of the Cuthbert–Dawson segment had a completed hard surface. By the middle of the next year, a portion east-southeast of the Atkinson–Ware county line had completed grading, but was not surfaced. The Tift County portion of the Sylvester–Tifton segment was under construction. By October, the Cuthbert–Dawson segment had a completed hard surface. From southeast of Georgetown to just east of the Quitman–Randolph county line, the highway was under construction. By the middle of 1937, all of SR 50 between Cuthbert and a point east-southeast of the Berrien–Atkinson county line had a completed hard surface. From a point southeast of Georgetown to just east of the Quitman–Randolph county line, it had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By October, the entire Quitman County portion had a completed hard surface. Two segments were under construction: the Randolph County portion of the Georgetown–Cuthbert segment and a portion west of Tifton. By September 1938, the Georgetown–Cuthbert segment had a completed hard surface. In late 1939, all of SR 50, including the US 84 concurrency, and all of SR 38 from Waycross to Midway, had a completed hard surface. =1940s to 1980s= Between February 1948 and April 1949, US 82 was designated on SR 50 from the Alabama state line to Waycross. By August 1950, SR 50 was extended southeast to a point just west of Jekyll Island. In 1952, SR 50 was extended southeast to the southern part of Jekyll Island. By September 1953, US 84 was extended on SR 50 southeast to a point south of Brunswick. Between June 1955 and July 1957, US 17/SR 25's path northeast of the US 84/SR 50 west of Brunswick was shifted south onto US 84/SR 50\\\\. Also, US 82 was extended on SR 38 from Waycross to Midway. Between June 1960 and June 1963, the path of SR& 50 through Albany was split into SR 50N and SR 50S. SR 50N used Broad Avenue and Sylvester Road, while US 82/SR 50S used Oglethorpe Avenue and Albany Expressway. In 1968, a northeastern bypass of the main part of Albany was proposed as a northern extension of SR 333 from the interchange of US 19/SR 333 and US 82/SR 50S in the eastern part of the city to US 19/SR 3W in the northwestern part of the city. In 1973, SR 50N was redesignated as SR 50 Conn., while SR 50S was redesignated as the SR 50 mainline. SR 50 was extended around the northern part of Jekyll Island. The next year, the bypass in Albany was built as a freeway, but there was no indication as to what highways were designated on it. In early 1980, US 19, US 82, and SR 333 were indicated to be designated on the Albany bypass. The old path of the highways were redesignated as US 19 Bus./US 82 Bus. with SR 3 concurrent with them in the western part of the city and SR 50 concurrent with them in the southern and eastern parts of it. Later that year, SR 333 was truncated out of Albany. SR 50 was shifted onto the US 19/US 82 freeway. Its old path in the city was redesignated as SR 50 Bus. The next year, SR 50 was truncated to the southwestern part of Jekyll Island. In 1988, SR 50 was further truncated to Dawson. Its former path from Dawson to Jekyll Island was redesignated as part of SR 520. In 1989, the segments of US 82 and US 84 east of Waycross were swapped. The Waycross–Brunswick segment of US 82/SR 520 was truncated to the I-95 interchange.

It travels from the Florida border near the Quitman area to the South Carolina state line, north of Pollards Corner. The highway connects North Central Florida with Upstate South Carolina. US 221 has concurrencies with Georgia State Route 76 (SR 76) from the Florida state line to Quitman, SR 333 within Quitman, SR 38 from Quitman to Valdosta, SR 7 in Valdosta, SR 31 from Valdosta to Douglas, SR 135 in Lakeland, SR 37 from Lakeland to east of Lakeland, SR 122 from Lakeland to northeast of Lakeland, SR 135 Byp. in Lakeland, SR 135 from Douglas to Uvalda, SR 32 Truck/SR 158 Truck and SR 32 in Douglas, SR 135 Conn. in Hazlehurst, SR 56 from Uvalda to Gillis Springs, SR 15 in Soperton, SR 171 from Gillis Springs to Louisville, SR 78 within the vicinity of Bartow, SR 47 within the vicinity of Louisville, SR 4 Bus. in Louisville, SR 4 and SR 17 from Louisville to Wrens, SR 88 and SR 540 in Wrens, SR 47 from Wrens to Pollards Corner, and SR 150 from Pollards Corner to the South Carolina state line. Concurrencies of US 221 with U.S. Highways in Georgia include US 84 from Quitman to Valdosta, US 41 in Valdosta, US 129 in the vicinity of Lakeland, US 441 from south-southwest of Pearson to Douglas, part of US 23/US 341 in Hazlehurst, US 319 within the vicinity of Bartow, and US 1 from Louisville to Wrens. Route description =Florida through Hazlehurst= Starting at the Florida line south of Quitman in Brooks County, US 221 heads north concurrent with SR 76\\\\. Just south of Quitman, both roads merge with an at-grade interchange with SR 333 until they reach downtown Quitman, passing over a railroad bridge over a former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad line. US 221/SR 76/SR 333 turn east at US 84/SR 38 in front of the Brooks County Probate CourthouseWelcome to the Probate Court of Brooks County (Georgia Courts.gov) and all five routes stay concurrent until the intersection with Washington Street where SR 76/333 split off to the north. Previously, SR 76 continued along US 84/221/SR 38 until Highland Road and split off to the northeast. Just before the bridge over the Okapilco Creek, the name of US 84/221/SR 38 changes from East Screven Street to Thomasville Road. The routes maintain this name even as they cross the bridge over the Withlacoochee River as well as the Brooks-Lowndes County Line. All the while, US 84/221/SR 38 runs in close proximity to the north side of the same former ACL line it passed over in Downtown Quitman. East of there, the road runs along small portion of the border with Valdosta becoming West Hill Avenue then enters it completely just before encountering the quarter cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 75 at Exit 16, and from there also serves as the beginning of the Interstate 75 Business Loop. US 84/221/I-BUS 75/SR 83 makes a brief curve to the southeast before the intersection with the southern terminus of SR 133\\\\. After crossing over a railroad bridge and then intersecting North Wells Street, the routes become a one-way pair splitting between Hill Avenue (eastbound) and Central Avenue (westbound). Further downtown, US 84/221/SR 38 encounters another one-way pair at US 41 Business, the southbound road uses North Patterson Street, and the northbound road which is a block later is at North Ashley Street, which takes I-BL 75 with it. West Hill and West Central Avenues become East Hill and East Central Avenues east of Patterson Street. Central Avenue ends at Hill Avenue and Forrest Street making the routes bidirectional four-lane undivided highway with center-left turn provisions once again. After Blanchard Street, the road becomes a divided highway just before crossing a pair of bridges over Knights Creek, then passes by some radio towers for WJEM (1150 AM). The end of US 221's multiplex with US 84/SR 38 takes place at the intersection with US 41/SRs 7/31 (Inner Perimeter Road), and US 221 turns north along a new multiplex. After a curve to the northwest, the four routes intersect East Park Avenue. Here, US 221/SR 31 split off to the northeast and then leaves the city, while US 41/SR 7 heads northwest towards I-75 at Exit 22. East Park Avenue runs northeast becoming Lakeland Highway, and passes through spares residencies and occasional farm fields of little importance. The only site of any significance along this route is the Bemiss Auxiliary Army Airfield which is hidden off in a wooden area accessible only by a dirt road just south of the Lowndes-Lanier County Line. The road starts curving more toward the north and somewhere off to the east is the beginning of Georgia State Route 31 Connector. North of there, it enters the Lakeland City Limits just south of Burnt Church Road, becoming South Valdosta Road. After passing the city department of public works garage it is joined by a concurrency with Georgia State Route 135. South Valdosta Road comes to an end, but US 221/SRs 31/135 turn right at a wrong-way concurrency with U.S. Route 129, which also has concurrencies with SRs 11/37/122. Georgia State Route 135's wrong way concurrency with US 129 ends as soon as it begins, because it is positioned at a pair of T-intersections set close to one another that requires a slight shift to the right for all traffic on North Carter Street. At Oak Street, another concurrency joins US 221, specifically SR 135 Bypass then two blocks later turns north onto North College Street, which is also the southern terminus of SR 11 Bypass. US 129/221/SRs 11/31/37/122 leaves the city limits at the bridge over \\"Big Creek\\" which is a tributary of the Alapaha River. These routes cross that river itself using the Captain Henry Will Jones Bridge. A former section of the route can be found curving off to the northwest at the intersection with a dirt road named \\"Old River Road,\\" and US 221/SRs 31/122 turns north just before US 129/SR 11's concurrency with SR 37 ends, almost in the same manner. Shortly after this, SR 122 breaks away from the multiplex, branching off to the east. The last intersection in Lanier County is a blinker-light intersection with Georgia State Route 168. Immediately after this the road cuts through a corner of Clinch County surrounded by forestland and only intersecting local dirt roads until it enters Atkinson County and encounters the southern terminus of a concurrency with Georgia State Route 64 South of Pearson, US 441 joins the concurrency with US 221/SRs 31/64 bringing the overlapping SR 89 to an end, however US 221 continues north along that multiplex until it reaches the town whereas SR 64 leaves at US 82. North of US 82 US 221/441/SR 31 becomes a four-lane undivided highway that runs northeast then after the bridge over Pudding Creek curves to the northwest along the left bank of the Satilla River, then turns straight north to finally cross that river. Six miles later the routes enter Douglas. Right after Douglas Municipal Airport US 221 leaves the US 441 multiplex, turning east at the intersection of Bowens Mill Road, which includes SRs 135/Truck Routes 32/158 and the southern terminus of Georgia State Route 206. A widening project is proposed for this segment. Just before reaching Brantley Boulevard the road starts to curve northeast. Truck Route 158 ends at SR 158, but US 221/Truck Route 32/SR 135 continues northeast. At a grade crossing with the same former Seaboard Coast Line Railroad line it previously went over, the routes encounter and intersection with Spooner Road and Iron Road, and then curves to the northwest. Georgia State Truck Route 32 finally ends at the east end of a short multiplex between SR 32, which ends at Westgreen Road, where westbound SR 32 turns left but northbound US 221/SR 135 turns right, passing a bridge over Seventeen Mile River, thus leaving the city limits. Despite this, US 221/SR 135 remains a four-lane undivided highway with a continuous left-turn lane and keeps the name Westgreen Road a little longer. Between Charmingdale and Tyson Roads, the outer northbound lane ends. North of the eastern terminus of the Georgia State Route 206 Connector, the road changes into a two-lane highway with a continuous left-turn lane, and after Clough Boulevard, the center-left turn lane ends. North of there it has a wye intersection with Cross Road, and then passes by the former Beaver Kreek Golf CourseBeaver Kreek Golf Club (WorldGolf.com) The road makes a direct northeast curve, then turns back to the north before passing through West Green. The last rural community is Lehigh before US 221 curves to the north-northeast and crosses the Coffee- Jeff Davis County Line. Remaining at the same trajectory, the first community US 221/SR 135 runs through in Jeff Davis County is the small City of Denton. North of Denton, the road becomes Douglas Highway, which briefly curves straight north and runs through Brooker where it meets the eastern terminus of Georgia State Route 107. Immediately curving to the north-northeast and later the northeast, the road passes through Roper. The few non-agricultural sites along the way include a campus of the Coastal Pines Technical College. Between Camelia Road and Palm Road, US 221/SR 135 passes over a small causeway over man-made lake utilizing Big Satilla Creek. The largest city within the county that it enters is Hazlehurst just south of the intersection with West Pineland Avenue. Between the unfinished Edgewood Street and Belleview Court, it passes by the Jeff Davis Hospital. Northbound US 221/SR 135 makes a right turn onto East Jefferson Street shared by southbound U.S. Route 23 Business as the beginning of another one-way pair. Just after the former west to northbound turning ramp, Northbound U.S. Truck Route 221 continues down East Jefferson Street along with southbound US 23 BUS, while northbound US BUS 23 joins northbound US 221 along South Cromartie Street. Both Cromartie Street and Tallahassee Street have railroad crossings for a former Southern Railway line (now the Norfolk Southern Railway's Brunswick District), but Tallahassee Street's crossing is directly in front of the former station. The route intersects with northbound US 23/341 and the north end of US BUS 23, and the truck routes for US 221/GA 135 officially comes to an end. US 23/341 and northbound US 221 run for one block until the routes curve to the north at East Coffee (GA Connecting Route 19) and West Jamar Streets, and northbound US 221 finally re-joins the southbound road once again at North Tallahassee Street, while northbound US 23/341 continues towards Eastman, Perry, Barnesville, Macon, Atlanta and Dillard. Heading into more rural surroundings, US 221/SR 135 passes by Jeff Davis Country Club, and later becomes the Uvalda Highway, passing by Tallahassee off to the northwest. Curving towards the east-northeast, the road passes through the territory of the Beasley Forest Products lumber yard, which contains a railroad line that ends on the southeast side of the road at an abandoned railroad crossing. East of the lumber yard, the road curves back more towards the north-northeast. The last site along the road within the county is the Towns Bluff Park & Heritage Center, a county park within the Bullard Creek Wildlife Management Area.Towns Bluff Park & Heritage Center (Jeff Davis County Parks Department) US 221/SR 135 crosses the Jeff Davis-Montgomery County Line at the foot of the Neal Lee Gillis Memorial Bridge, a long two-lane causeway over the Altamaha River. =North of Hazlehurst through Bartow= After the bridge, US 221/SR 135 only has intersections with a boat launching area and some minor dirt driveways until the blinker-light intersection with South Old River Road (Montgomery CR 150). Further north it passes through the eastern edge of Charlotteville. Entering Uvalda, the street name changes to First Street. As it approaches Main Street, the concurrency with SR 135 ends, and US 221 turns left at East Main Street to join another concurrency with Georgia State Route 56. SR 135 continues north along First Street towards Petross and Higgston. At Beulah Street, East Main Street becomes West Main Street, and US 221/SR 56 curves to the north-northwest. Just after leaving the city limits, the routes are officially named the Edward C. Moses Memorial Highway, continuing to run northwest through rural Montgomery County. South of East Gillis Street, the road enters Mount Vernon and becomes South Mason Street. After running between a cemetery and an agricultural feed store, that street end at East Church Street becoming yet another one way pair around the Montgomery County Courthouse Square, with northbound US 221/SR 56 along McEachin Street and Broad Street, and southbound US 221/SR 56 along South Railroad Avenue and Church Street. Leaving the square at Railroad Avenue, the routes remain part of downtown Mount Vernon. Only when they intersect US 280/SR 30 (Spring Street) does US 221 become North Railroad Avenue. The road leaves the city limits along an embankment and culverts over Flat Creek, and after this is named the Gary P. Braddy Highway, and briefly has a second northbound lane. A dirt road named Hobson Wells Road branches off to the northeast, which while otherwise unimportant in that location, returns back to US 221 across from the paved southern terminus of Georgia State Route 199. Northeast of SR 199, it runs through the western edge of Tarrytown. Somewhere north of the Montgomery- Treutlen County Line, a second northbound lane forms along the left side of the existing northbound lane. The inner northbound lane becomes the primary lane as the outer-northbound lane ends just before the intersection with Lawson Beck Road, only for a second southbound lane to form again north of Mount Olive Church Road until north of the intersection with Sessions Road. Within Soperton US 221/SR 56 gains the name Mount Vernon Road, but north of Fowler Street and South Third Street, it curves to the right to intersect and become South Second Street. Further in town, the routes have an intersection with SRs 15/29 (West and East Main Streets) just before a railroad crossing. SR 15 briefly joins US 221/SR 56 from East Main Street for two blocks before turning left onto West Louisiana Avenue, where that route joins another concurrency with SR 78. At Metter Road, US 221/SR 56 intersects SR 46, then the name changes from North Second Street to Swainsboro Highway. The routes curve to the east-northeast, and just as it leaves the city limits runs along the northern edge of Treutlen County Airport (SR 46 runs along the southern edge),Treutlen County Airport- 4J8 (AirNav.com) which is across from a small cemetery. The road remains at relatively the same trajectory, until it intersects SR 86, then curves towards the north-northeast just before crossing Interstate 16, at Exit 78. North of there is the rural community of Gillis Springs where SR 56 turns east to leave the concurrency with US 221 and a new concurrency along Georgia State Route 171 begins. The intersection with Norristown Road is where US 221/SR 171 crosses the Treutlen-Emanuel County Line, then it crosses a bridge over the Ohoopee River as it enters Norristown. Here the closest resemblance to a major intersection is Keas Old Mill Pond Road and Norristown Covena Road. North of Norristown, the road curves to the north-northeast and remains within that trajectory, even as it passes through the blinker-light intersection with U.S. Route 80. North of US 80, US 221/SR 171 makes an almost immediate northwest curve at a fork in the road with Cow Ford Bridge Road, and doesn't curve back to the northeast again until after the intersection with Foskey Road. The road quickly enters and leaves the Emanuel-Johnson County Line, and has one last intersection in Emanuel County, specifically with WES Lawson Road, only to re-enter Johnson County again. Throughout most of the county, the road is named Montgomery Street. Briefly, it almost seems like it's going to run straight north, but then curves to the north-northwest. The first and only major community it enters within the county is Kite where it has a blinker-light intersection with Georgia State Route 57. Beyond SR 57 it remains in a relative northwest trajectory, until it makes a sudden curve to the right near the intersection of Gumlog Road to cross a bridge over the Little Ohoopee River, and then curves back to the left again after the intersection with Swan Creek Road. Further north it curves to the east-northeast where it crosses the Johnson-Jefferson County Line southwest of the intersection with Coleman Chapel Road (Jefferson CR 334). The road that was previously named Montgomery Street in Johnson County, curves back to the north-northeast and is about to terminate, when US 221/SR 171 is joined by a concurrency with US 319/SR 78. From there, US 221/319/SRs 78/171 continue to the northeast until they approach Braddy Road where it turns straight north until the intersection with Tarver Grove Church Road. At the eastern terminus of Georgia State Route 242 US 221/319 officially enters Bartow, the crosses a bridge over the Williamson Swamp Creek. Immediately after crossing a railroad line and curving to the right, US 221/SR 171 makes a left turn onto Church Street, officially leaving the concurrency with US 319/SR 78, as US 319 heads to Wadley, and SR 78 heads toward Midville. =Bartow to South Carolina= Continuing along Church Street north of Bartow, US 221/SR 171 stays relatively north as it curves back and forth through western Jefferson County, passing through a few agricultural areas, and residential zones, as well as the occasional church, but mainly forestland with some wetlands hidden in the trees. The one exception to this is a dip in the road approaching a culvert over a small river leading to Cobb Lake. Near Almira the road seems as if it's about to end at a west to east road surrounded by more farmland, but instead turns right and joins a concurrency with Georgia State Route 24. From that point on, US 221/SRs 24/171 curves to the east-northeast as they approach a bridge over the Ogeechee River, and the forested marshland that surround the river. The concurrency with SR 171 finally ends at Grange Road, which runs northwest, but US 221/SR 24 crosses another bridge over a tributary to the Ogeechee River before entering Louisville. At West Broad Street, US Business Route 1/SR BUS 4 joins the routes from the south, and the concurrency with SR 24 ends as it briefly turns south onto Ninth Street. US BUS 1/221/SBR 4 curves to the north in front of City Hall, then later joins up with and at-grade interchange with US 1 and SRs 4/17 as the business routes for each come to an end. From that interchange on, US 1/221/SRs 4/17 is a two lane highway with continuous left-turn lane provisions that end at the driveway to the Jefferson County Landfill. That center turn lane is replaced by a brief second northbound lane. Long after that second northbound lane replaces the first one, the routes encounter the southern terminus of Georgia State Route 296, then passes along the eastern edge of Jefferson County High School (SR 296 runs west of the western edge of the school). Running through Wrens, the proposed Interstate 14 is supposed to run through and have an interchange with US 1-221, but for now the segment of that proposed interstate serves as the southern end of the SR 88 multiplex. Northeast of there, US 1/221/SRs 4/88 loses the concurrency with SR 17 at Thompson Street, and SR 88 leaves the concurrency at SR 80 as it briefly joins that route in another concurrency. Just after US 1/SR 4 widens to a four-lane undivided highway, US 221 splits off to the northwest cosigned with Georgia State Route 47 and passes the Wrens Memorial Airport. Later US 221/SR 47 starts to curve more toward the northeast rather than the northwest. Briefly entering McDuffie County at the bridge over Brier Creek the road encounters only local intersections, and momentarily turns east until it turns northeast again as it passes through Avondale, then later enters Columbia County at a culvert over Boggy Gut Creek, gaining the name Harlem-Wrens Road as well as the additional name of Jake Pollard Highway.\\"Highway named for State Senator,\\" by Columbia County Bureau Chief (The Augusta Chronicle; May 9, 1998) Through the Harlem City Line the name changes to South Louisville Street, but still holds onto the dual name of Jake Pollard Highway even as it intersects US 78/278/SR 10. North of there, the road becomes North Louisville Street and passes by Columbia Theatre,Columbia Theatre (Harlem, Georgia) then a Georgia Railroad and Banking Company railroad crossing between South Hicks Street and North Hicks Street, and later the Laurel and Hardy Museum.The Laurel and Hardy Museum of Harlem, Georgia After leaving Harlem, the street name changes from North Louisville Street to the Harlem-Appling Highway. Few sites exist along this segment, including intersections, all of which are paved whether significant or otherwise. Among them is a shared intersection with Fairview Drive and Old Union Road. On the northwest corner of the intersection with Clary Cut Road, it passes a water tower and then Harlem High School. North of a former section of Harlem-Appling Highway it encounters a traffic circle with Georgia State Route 223. From there it runs through more Georgia Pine Forest until it approaches a diamond interchange with Interstate 20 (Georgia State Route 402) at Exit 183, just east of a pair of rest areas, and about 20 miles west of Augusta. Another former segment is encountered after this, in this case it's named Lonegran Hulme Road. The next major intersection is the western terminus of Georgia State Route 232 south of Appling. Within Appling itself, US 221/SR 47 branches off to the northeast at Ray Owens Road which continues straight, and then replaces the trajectory of White Oak Road to become Scotts Ferry Road. Aside from crossing a bridge over a Greenbrier Creek between Tubman Road and Yelton Road, and an extra northbound lane within the vicinity of a church, there isn't much in the way of notable features about the road. Shortly before crossing into South Carolina, Georgia State Route 150 joins up at the Pollards Corner intersection as SR 47 turns away. This specific intersection is a blinker-light intersection that also includes the western terminus of Georgia State Route 104, and a one block concurrency with SRs 47/150, both of which are along Washington Avenue, and US 221 along Scotts Ferry Road. Scotts Ferry Road turns more toward the northeast later becoming Clark's Hill Road, and yet still continues with the dual name of Jake Pollard Highway. Beginning at the Spring Grove Missionary Baptist Church, the road curves from northeast to southeast. On the north side of this segment, a private road leading from an unfinished intersection is a driveway to the Augusta Sailing Club. Curving back to the east-northeast, he last two sites in Georgia are the West Dam Recreation AreaWest Dam, Georgia (Recreation.gov) and the driveway to the \\"Below Dam Georgia Boat Ramp\\" before the passage into South Carolina occurs on top of the J. Strom Thurmond Dam which forms the southern shore of Lake Strom Thurmond.

Licensed to Sheridan, Wyoming, United States, the station is currently owned by Lovcom, Inc. and features programming from CBS Radio. All Lovcom stations are located in the Sheridan Media Radio Center, at 1716 KROE Lane on Sheridan's east side. History KWYO signed on the air for the first time on Monday, July 9, 1934 at 7:00pm, becoming Sheridan, Wyoming's first radio station. (KWYO is the second oldest radio station in Wyoming, behind KTWO in Casper, which signed on as KDFN in 1930.) The original studio location was on the second floor of the Carroll's Furniture Store at 340 N. Main. During its early years, KWYO operated only at various times of the day, generally closing down in the afternoon from 1pm to 5pm. Between 1934 and 1941, the station increased its air time to a 17½ hour broadcast day. In 1941, the power was increased from 100 to 1000 watts and KWYO moved from 1370 to 1410 on the AM dial. In 1949, the studios were moved to the upper floor of the Gillette building at 21 North Main Street, and another move to 140 East Loucks occurred in 1961. In 1977, the power was increased to 5,000 watts. A sister FM station, KLWD (now KYTI), signed on at 96.5FM in 1978. In the mid 80s, the studios were relocated again, and throughout most of the 1990s, the programming originated from the 2nd floor of an office building at 2 North Main. In 1997, KWYO's studios were relocated to the Sheridan Media building at 1716 KROE Lane. In 2017, KWYO began simulcasting programming at 106.9 FM on translator K295CP. Programming KWYO began operation with 2,000 phonograph records ranging from grand opera to jazz. Through the 80s and 90s the station played country music from records and compact disc. When the studios moved to the Sheridan Media building the format on KWYO was changed to Westwood One's satellite- delivered \\"Adult Standards.\\" Several years later, the music lineup was revamped slightly with a move to ABC's \\"Memories\\" format, and then again when that satellite format was dropped in favor of a Waitt Radio Networks provided Adult Contemporary format. At 1pm on January 29, 2008, the format was changed to \\"Oldies Plus,\\" also provided by Waitt Radio Networks. A few years later, it was switched again to a Classic Country format provided by Westwood One. In addition to music, KWYO broadcasts Sheridan City Council meetings, and provides live play-by-play of Sheridan area football and basketball games. The station was an ABC News affiliate for many decades, but switched to CBS News in the mid 2010s.

It became the center of the New York art world for the remainder of the 19th century.Museum of the City of New York Situated at 51 West 10th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in Manhattan, the building was commissioned by James Boorman JohnstonJames Boorman Johnston (1822-1887) was a son of the prominent Scottish-born New York merchant John Johnston, in partnership with James Boorman (1783-1866) as Boorman & Johnston, developers of Washington Square North, and a founder of New York University; an 1831 Johnston Children group portrait is in the inventory of the Museum of the City of New york. and designed by Richard Morris Hunt. Its innovative design soon represented a national architectural prototype, and featured a domed central gallery, from which interconnected rooms radiated. Hunt's studio within the building housed the first architectural school in the United States. Soon after its completion, the building helped to make Greenwich Village central to the arts in New York City, drawing artists from all over the country to work, exhibit, and sell their art. In its initial years, Winslow Homer took a studio there,(anon.), \\"Evoking the World of Winslow Homer\\", The New York Times, August 17, 1997 as did Edward Lamson Henry, and many of the artists of the Hudson River School, including Martin Johnson Heade and Albert Bierstadt. Perhaps the most famous tenant of all was Frederic Edwin Church, who held a landmark single-picture exhibition of The Heart of the Andes in the building's central atrium.https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/10481 In 1879, Johnston deeded the building to his brother John Taylor Johnston, who later became the first president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In that same year William Merritt Chase moved into the main gallery, and was joined in the building by Walter Shirlaw and Frederick Dielman. Chase's studio in particular represented the sophisticated taste which came to characterize the building. In 1895, Chase departed the studio, and the building subsequently lost its prominence as an art center. Kahlil Gibran lived on the third story from 1911 until his death in 1931. In 1920, the building was purchased by a group of artists in order to forestall commercial takeover. From that time forward, a number of New York City artists rented studio space in the building. In 1942, the building's basement became the meeting place for the Bombshell Artists Group, an alliance of 60 modernist painters and sculptors, a number of whom had studios in the building. Henry Becket, writing in the New York Post newspaper on March 2, 1942, noted that \\"The artists meet in a cellar that they call The Bomb Shelter at 51 West 10th Street.\\" He also stated that the Bombshell Group's \\"exhibition chairman\\" was Joseph Manfredi and the Group's first show was then on display at the Riverside Museum.Henry Becket, \\"Rembrandt Doesn't Eat, Bombshellers Do - Hence an Exhibit,\\" New York Post, March 2, 1942.

The line was built as a narrow gauge branch line of the Jæren Line by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) and opened in 1924. It runs through the villages of Foss-Eikeland and Figgjo in Sandnes to Ålgård in Gjesdal. Several proposals were made for the Ålgård Line to become the first part of the main line from Stavanger to Oslo, but instead the Sørlandet Line was connected to the Jæren Line in 1944. At the same time, the Ålgård Line was upgraded to standard gauge. The line had up to ten daily round trips with diesel multiple units, until passenger traffic was terminated in 1955. Freight traffic remained until 1988, when most of the line was abandoned in 1988, although was used until 2001. The line is owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The station at Figgjo has been converted to a museum, and the section from there to Ålgård is used for recreational draisines. There have been proposals to reopen the line either as part of the Jæren Commuter Rail or the planned light rail for Greater Stavanger. Route Map of the Jæren Line and the Ålgård Line The Ålgård Line runs from Ganddal to Ålgård.Aspenberg (1994): 227 The whole line was built with NSB's standard for main lines, with a maximum gradient of 1.5 percent and minimum curve radius of .Thime (1999): 12 It branches off from the Sørlandet Line (previously the Jæren Line) north of Ganddal Station, south of Stavanger. When the line opened, Ganddal Station was located south of the creek Stokkelandselven, but it was moved further north in 1935 to simplify operations.Thime (1999): 23 The line continues over Stokkelandsevlen on a bridge, and follows the creek until it reaches Foss-Eikeland, from Ganddal. Foss-Eikeland had a passing loop and a platform. The station building was built in wood, had a single story and was .Thime (1999): 35 After Foss-Eikeland, the line crosses Figgjo River on a truss bridge. It passes Bråstein Station and continues up the steepest gradient at 1.5 percent to Figgjo Station. It had a passing loop and a platform, and a single-story station building in wood.Thime (1999): 62 Ålgård Station was the largest on the line, with two tracks and a platform, a turntable and a depot. The station was built in wood in two stories, and included living quarters for the station master.Thime (1999): 76 The line is, along with the Namsos Line, the only railway line in Norway to holistically employ Neoclassical architecture.Hartmann (1997): 89 All the original stations were designed by R. Werenskiold, who used a simplistic, wooden interpretation of the 1920s Neoclassicism.Hartmann (1997): 139 The station buildings at Figgjo and Ålgård have been preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage.Hartmann (1997): 140 The line eventually received additional stops, and in 1955, there were stations at Holane, Vagle, Foss-Eikeland, Kalberg, Bråstein, Figgjo Fajanse, Figgjo, Figgjo fabrikker and Ålgård. Some trains operated to Sandnes Station, whilst others continued all the way to Stavanger Station. As of 1994, the line was intact and operational from Ganddal to Foss-Eigeland and the cement factory there. Here, an internal crane track has been welded across the line. From Foss-Eigeland to Figgjo, the track is intact. At Figgjo, a bridge has been demolished, and it is not possible to traverse that section. Except for a number of level crossings where the tracks have been asphalted over, the line remains intact to Ålgård. At Ålgård Station the tracks have been removed, but the station building and depot remains. The station at Foss-Eigeland has been converted to a church, while the station at Figgjo had been taken over by a wholesaler.Aspenberg (1994): 231 The line has officially been closed, but has not been abandoned. The Norwegian National Rail Administration retains ownership and can in the future renovate the line for operation. History Ålgård Station in 1924 The first plans to build a railway line along the route of the Ålgård Line was as part of the main route between Stavanger and Oslo. In 1873, County Engineer Th. Sejersted proposed a line running through Høgsfjord, Dirdal, Hunnedalen, Sirdal and Hylestad and onwards through Telemark to Kongsberg. Through Rogaland, it would run further east than the Jæren Line, which was under construction from Stavanger to Egersund. When the plans for a Sørlandet Line—which would connect Stavanger to Oslo via Kristiansand—started to be developed in 1892, some of Sjersted's plans were reconsidered.Thime (1999): 7 On 27 September 1894, a committee was established to plan a branch from the Jæren Line to Ålgård. The following year, the committee recommended that a line be built branching from Orstad in Klepp, which would cost 348,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). Gjesdal Municipality offered NOK 60,000 of the capital, on the condition that NSB would build and operate it. The state, on the other hand, wanted the line to be private.Thime (1999): 8 Private railways were often largely or entirely owned by municipalities, counties and the state, but would operate independently of NSB, and the municipalities would carry the risk for operating deficits.Aspenberg (1994): 14 A new committee was established in 1910, led by Mayor Sven Nilssen of Gjesdal, who was also director at Ålgårds Ullvarefabrikker. His company paid for traffic counting along the route, and the committee concluded that there was sufficient traffic to build a line. Two routes were proposed: one branching from Sandnes Station and one from Ganddal Station. The Ganddal alternative had lower investment costs, but would give higher operating costs; in 1913, investments were stipulated at NOK 787,800. Although NSB's board supported the line, construction was placed on hold. In 1919, local politicians proposed that the line be built administratively as part of the Jæren Line, but this was rejected by the government. Instead, the ministry wanted to again consider the Ålgård Line as part of the Sørlandet Line, and proposed that the Ålgård Line be built with standard gauge—which would be used for the Sørlandet Line—instead of the narrow gauge used by the Jæren Line. However, there would be no need for standard gauge until the Sørlandet Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be built with narrow gauge track, but all other installations would be prepared for standard gauge.Thime (1999): 9 Ganddal Station, where the Ålgård Line branches off from the Sørland Line Siting of the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård started in 1920. The final cost estimate was NOK 2.82 million and the plan was passed by Parliament on 20 July 1921, with construction commencing on 21 December. The construction was organized by Just Broch and led by Olaf Bakke.Thime (1999): 13 Between 200 and 250 people worked on the line during construction. Because of the recession, the railway works were seen as way to create jobs. Most of the workers came from Stavanger and nearly all had families to support.Thime (1999): 14 The first train to operate on the line went from Stavanger on 20 December 1924, with the official opening by Minister of Labour Lars Oftedal taking place when it reached Ålgård. The line became the last state-owned railway in Norway to be opened with narrow gauge. At the start, there were one or two daily round trips with steam locomotive-hauled trains.Aspenberg (1994): 228 In the first year of operation, the line transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to Ålgård was NOK 1.50, compared to NOK 1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length of the line, and the line was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while NSB's board accepted that tickets be priced as if they were the length of the road, and the price was reduced to NOK 1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK 0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK 0.80 in 1927. The line made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which it started to operate with a deficit. In the financial year 1948–49, the line transported 79,700 passengers.Thime (1999): 15 In 1923, Parliament voted for a plan for the Sørlandet Line to run via Bjerkreim instead of the city of Egersund, and then onwards via Gjesdal. This plan meant that the section from Ganddal to Stavanger would have dual gauge. During further planning, it became clear that the Gjesdal alternative, although shorter, had a greater elevation difference than that needed for connecting the Sørlandet Line to the Jæren Line. This changed the NSB board's and Rogaland County Council's opinion, and the Jæren alternative was chosen. The final decision to build via Jæren was made by parliament in 1937.Thime (1999): 11 An inter-municipal railway committee was established in 1941. Led by Sigval Bergesen, it considered the possibility of extending the Ålgård Line towards Hunnedalen via Setesdalsheiene to Lunde in Telemark. The line would be built with a higher standard than the Sørlandet Line and have a shorter route, allowing travel time from Stavanger to Oslo to be reduced to four to five hours. A detailed plan was made for the extension from Ålgård to the county border with Telemark. To consider the proposal, parliament established a committee in 1949 to look at the various proposals. After considering the impact and value of the various railways that had been proposed in the 1940s, it recommended not building the Inner Trunk Line, as the expansion had been christened. Ålgård Station, the terminus In 1930, an NSB Class Cmb1 diesel multiple unit was taken into use, and the number of daily trips increased to four. On days with heavy traffic, it hauled a trailer, which was normally stationed at Sandnes Station. On 10 November 1935, the new Ganddal Station opened, simplifying the stopping at the station. During World War II, the multiple units were disused, and instead the trains were hauled with steam locomotives. From 1 May 1944, the line was converted to standard gauge, and NSB Class 14 multiple units were taken into use, running on wood gas until the end of the war. In 1945, there were four daily round trips, but at the start of 1946, the number of daily round trips increased to six, and from mid-1946, to ten. From 1947 to 1953, there were eight or nine daily round trips, and from 1953 ten. Class 14 was eventually replaced with NSB Class 86 and NSB Class 87 in 1953. By then, the driving time from Ålgård to Sandnes had been reduced from 38 to 25 minutes. In the 1940s and 1950s, several companies started a competing bus service. There were accusations that the route was cross-subsidized and that price dumping was occurring along the route from Sandnes to Ålgård. In the early 1950s, discussion started about closing the line, and on 1 November 1955, all passenger transport was terminated,Aspenberg (1994): 230 after a decision in parliament on 26 May 1955.Thime (1999): 17 This is the line with the most frequent passenger traffic in Norway to have been closed. After it was decided that passenger transport on the railway was to be terminated, both NSB's bus division and other private companies, particularly Sverre Hage, wanted to have the concession to operate the line. Both established a bus services with a frequency as if the other operator did not exist. At the peak of the conflict, NSB's operations were at one point stopped by the police, although in the end, the concession was granted to them. As a response, Haga applied for concession to operate passenger transport on the railway, but this was denied by the authorities. The transfer to bus operations increased the ticket prices and travel time. Freight trains to the various industrial companies along the line remained until the 1980s, when traffic sank drastically. From 1988, the line was closed from Foss-Eigeland, although the line from there to Ganddal was kept for use for a cement factory. Until 2001 only the three first kilometers (two first miles) of the line were used, for transport of concrete structures, but then the Norwegian National Rail Administration stopped all traffic on the line. Heritage Figgjo Station has been transformed into a museum about the line. The non-profit organization Friends of the Ålgård Line () have preserved of the line and Figgjo Station. The station has been converted to a museum, while the railway between Figgjo and Ålgård is used for renting out draisines. At Figgjo, there is a railway car and a shunter on display. Future Several local politicians have proposed re-opening the line and either making it part of the Jæren Commuter Rail or part of the planned light rail in Greater Stavanger. Additionally, the Norwegian National Rail Administration has supported a future re-opening of the line. Estimates show that the line has a traffic potential for 600,000 passengers per year. In a proposal from the National Rail Administration, the Ålgård Line is seen as a possible branch of the commuter rail, with stations at Vagle, Figgjo, Kongeparken and Ålgård. Without making any investments to the Sørlandet Line, it would be possible to extend the two hourly services that terminate at Sandnes to Ålgård. Ålgård is also a good location for a park and ride for European Route E39. However, the Ålgård Line would need a full upgrade, including new tracks, electric system and signaling. This would give a travel time from Ganddal to Ålgård of 10 to 12 minutes. The estimated cost of re-opening the line is NOK 500 million. The Center Party has proposed converting the line to a bus lane. The borough council of Figgjo has voted to convert the line to a bicycle path, but this has been rejected by the National Rail Administration.

It was then further developed in England and America until the early 19th century, although theological ancestors are to be found as far back as the early days of Christianity. It matured and reached its classical form in the middle 19th century. Later historical development has been diverse in different countries. Historical antecedents =Early origins= Unitarians trace their history back to the Apostolic Age, i.e. the life of Jesus and the decades immediately after his death, and claim this doctrine was widespread during the pre-Nicene period, that is, before the First Council of Nicaea met in 325. Many believe their Christology (understanding of Jesus Christ) most closely reflects that of the \\"original Christians.\\" (For a discussion of the New Testament evidence, see Nontrinitarianism.) While it is evident that other Christologies existed in the late 1st and early 2nd centuries, at least some Jewish-Christian congregations tended to hold the view that Jesus was a great man and prophet, even the Son of God, but not God himself. (See Ebionites.) One of the earliest controversies over the nature of Christ that involved the propagation of \\"unitarian\\" ideas broke out at Rome during the episcopate of Victor I (189–199). This was the so-called \\"Monarchian controversy\\", which originated in a revolt against the influential Logos theology of Justin Martyr and the apologists, who had spoken of Jesus as a second god. Such language was disturbing to some. Justin's language appeared to promote ditheism (two gods). The view, however, was defended by Hippolytus of Rome, for whom it was essential to say that the Father and the Logos are two distinct \\"persons\\" (prosopa). Some critics of Justin's theology tried to preserve the unity of God by saying that there is no difference to be discerned between the ‘Son’ and the ‘Father’ (unless ‘Son’ is a name for the physical body or humanity of Christ and ‘Father’ a name for the divine Spirit within). This sort of thinking, known as Modal Monarchianism or Sabellianism, would one day lead to a compromise doctrine that the Father and the Son are consubstantial (of the same being). Other critics preserved the unity of God by saying that Jesus was a man, but differentiated in being indwelt by the Spirit of God to an absolute and unique degree. They thus denied that Jesus was God or a god. They became known as \\"adoptionists\\", because they suggested that Jesus was adopted by the Father to be his Son. This view was associated with Theodotus of Byzantium (the Shoemaker) and Artemon. So even at this early stage we find evidence of proto-Arianism (Justin's view) and proto-Socinianism (the Adoptionist view), though they were, as yet, not fully formed. Both of these theologies have similarities to latter day Unitarianism. The Monarchian controversy came to a head again in the mid-3rd century. In 259 the help of Dionysius of Alexandria, was invoked in a dispute among the churches in Libya between adherents of Justin's Logos-theology and some modalist Monarchians. Dionysius vehemently attacked the modalist standpoint. He affirmed that the Son and the Father were as different as a boat and a boatman and denied that they were \\"of one substance\\" (homoousios). The Libyans appealed to Dionysius of Rome, whose rebuke to his Alexandrian namesake stressed the unity of God and condemned \\"those who divide the divine monarchy into three separate hypostases and three deities\\". Another crisis occurred over Paul of Samosata, who became bishop of Antioch in Syria in 260. Paul's doctrine is akin to the primitive Jewish- Christian idea of the person of Christ and to the Christology of Theodotus of Byzantium (adoptionism). To many his doctrine seemed plain heresy, and a council of local bishops was held to consider his case in 268. The bishops found it easier to condemn Paul than to expel him, and he remained in full possession of the church with his enthusiastic supporters. However, the bishops appealed to the Roman emperor, who decided that the legal right to the church building should be assigned \\"to those to whom the bishops of Italy and Rome should communicate in writing\\". It was the first time that an ecclesiastical dispute had to be settled by the secular power. So Paul was put out of his church. Arius, son of Ammonius, was a popular priest appointed presbyter for the district of Baucalis in Alexandria in 313. His views of the nature of Jesus, although not original, conflicted with the views held by Bishop Alexander of Alexandria. Both Arius and Alexander held that Jesus was the Word (Logos) made perfect Flesh; however, Arius held that the Word was the first Son and Creation of God, who had a beginning of existence, coming after God the Father in time and substance,\\"‘If,’ said he, ‘the Father begat the Son, he that was begotten had a beginning of existence: and from this it is evident, that there was a time when the Son was not. It therefore necessarily follows, that he had his substance from nothing.’\\" (Socrates Scholasticus, Ecclesiastical History I:5). Arius later toned down his statements in order to be restored to communion and said that Christ was begotten simply \\"before the ages\\" (Socrates Scholasticus, Ecclesiastical History I:26). whereas Alexander held that the Word was co-eternal and consubstantial with God. When disagreement arose between the two men, forces were set in motion that resulted in the formation of the doctrine of the Trinity. In the Nicene Creed adopted at the First Council of Nicaea in 325, wherein the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great got involved, the issue was considered settled and the adoption of Alexander's view became the orthodox doctrine and all other views were considered heresy and officially suppressed. During the reign of the emperor Constantius II, however, the anti-Nicene party rose to prominence and exercised considerable control over the church for about a generation. New creeds were drawn up to counter the homoousian doctrine of the Nicene Creed. When Theodosius I took the imperial throne, however, the tables were turned, and at the Council of Constantinople in 381, the position that the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost were all the same being was agreed upon, and the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity was complete. Theodosius outlawed all Nontrinitarian forms of Christianity. =The Protestant Reformation= The Protestant Reformation of the 16th century saw in many European countries an outbreak, more or less serious, of anti-Trinitarian opinion.Pocket Dictionary of Church History Nathan P. Feldmeth p135 \\"Unitarianism. Unitarians emerged from Protestant Christian beginnings in the sixteenth century with a central focus on the unity of God and subsequent denial of the doctrine of the Trinity\\" Some doubt has been raised about the Reformers' commitment to previous beliefs, including previous Christology: John Henry Newman wrote, \\"Luther himself at one time rejected the Apocalypse, called the Epistle of St. James straminea ['straw'], condemned the word 'Trinity,' fell into a kind of Eutychianism in his view of the Holy Eucharist, and in a particular case sanctioned bigamy. Calvinism, again, in various distinct countries, has become Socinianism, and Calvin himself seems to have denied our Lord's Eternal Sonship and ridiculed the Nicene Creed. \\"Another evidence, then, of the faithfulness of an ultimate development is its definite anticipation at an early period in the history of the idea to which it belongs.\\"John Henry Newman (1878), An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine, 1960 reprint, Garden City, NY: Image Books, Part II, \\"Doctrinal Developments Viewed Relatively to Doctrinal Corruption\\", Ch. V, \\"Genuine Development Contrasted with Corruptions\\", § 6, \\"Sixth Note: Conservative Action upon Its Past\\", p. 200. [Newman's emphases.] Suppressed as a rule in individual cases, this type of doctrine ultimately became the badge of separate religious communities, in Poland, Hungary and, at a much later date, in England. By contrast, Sabellianism (also known as modalism, modalistic monarchianism, or modal monarchism) is the nontrinitarian belief that the Heavenly Father, Resurrected Son and Holy Spirit are different modes or aspects of one God, as perceived by the believer, rather than three distinct persons in God Himself. Along with the fundamental doctrine, certain characteristics have always marked those who profess unitarianism: a large degree of tolerance, a historical study of scripture, a minimizing of essentials, and a repugnance to formulated creed. Martin Cellarius (1499–1564), a friend of Luther, and Hans Denck (1500–1527) usually are considered the first literary pioneers of the movement; the anti- Trinitarian position of Ludwig Haetzer did not become public until after his execution (1529) for Anabaptism. Luther himself was opposed to the Unitarian movement, and viewed the founder of Islam, Muhammad, as an adherent to the teachings of Arius. Michael Servetus (1511?–1553) stimulated thought in this direction and heavily influenced other reformers both by his writings and by his death at the stake. In 1531 he had published his theological treatise De Trinitatis Erroribus (On the Errors About the Trinity), in which he rejected the Nicene dogma of the Trinity and proposed that the Son was the union of the divine Logos with the man Jesus, miraculously born from the Virgin Mary through the intervention of God's spirit. This was generally interpreted as a denial of the Trinitarian dogma (actually Servetus had described the Trinity as a \\"three-headed Cerberus\\" and \\"three ghosts\\" which only led believers to confusion and error). Servetus expanded his ideas on the nature of God and Christ 20 years later in his major work, Christianismi Restitutio (The Restoration of Christianity), which caused his burning at the stake in Calvin's Geneva (and also in effigy by the Catholic Inquisition in France) in 1553 . Nowadays most Unitarians see Servetus as their pioneer and first martyr, and his thought was a remarkable influence in the beginnings of Polish and Transylvanian Anti-trinitarian churches,See Stanislas Kot, \\"L'influence de Servet sur le mouvement atitrinitarien en Pologne et en Transylvanie\\", in B. Becker (Ed.), Autour de Michel Servet et de Sebastien Castellion, Haarlem, 1953. even though his Arian views on Jesus Christ (e.g. retaining belief in the pre-existence of Christ) were different from those of the Polish Socinians (rejecting belief in Jesus' pre-existence), and again from the generation of Thomas Belsham (rejecting also the virgin birth), and very different from what the Unitarian Church generally believes today. The Anabaptist Council of Venice 1550, marks the start of a formal but underground antitrinitarian movement in Italy, led by men such as Matteo Gribaldi. The Italian exiles spread antitrinitarian views to Switzerland, Germany, Poland, Transylvania and Holland. The Dialogues (1563) of Bernardino Ochino, while defending the Trinity, stated objections and difficulties with a force which captivated many. In his 27th Dialogue Ochino points to Hungary as a possible home of religious liberty. And in Poland and Hungary definitely anti-Trinitarian religious communities first formed and were tolerated. Classical period of Unitarianism =Poland= Scattered expressions of anti-Trinitarian opinion appeared in Poland early. At the age of 80, Catherine, wife of Melchior Vogel or Weygel, was burned at Cracow (1539) for apostasy; whether her views embraced more than deism is not clear. The first synod of the (Calvinist) Reformed Church took place in 1555; the second Synod (1556) faced the theological challenges of Grzegorz Paweł z Brzezin (Gregory Pauli) and Peter Gonesius (Piotr z Goniądza), who were aware of the works of Servetus and of Italian antitrinitarians such as Matteo Gribaldi. The arrival of Giorgio Biandrata in 1558 furnished the party with a temporary leader. The term \\"Unitarian\\" first appeared as unitaria religio in a document of the Diet of Lécfalva, Transylvania on 25 October 1600, though it was not widely used in Transylvania until 1638, when the formal recepta Unitaria Religio was published. The Polish Brethren began as a grouping of Arians and Unitarians who split from the Polish Calvinist Church in 1565,e.g. Encyclopedia of Protestantism: Hans Joachim Hillerbrand - 2003 \\"The religious doctrines of the Polish Unitarians after the Rakow episode retained many Calvinist elements\\" though by 1580 the Unitarian views of Fausto Sozzini (hence the adjective Socinian) had become the majority. Sozzini's grandson Andrzej Wiszowaty Sr. in 1665-1668 published Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum quos Unitarios vocant (Library of the Polish Brethren who are called Unitarians 4 vols. 1665–69). The name was introduced into English by the Socinian Henry Hedworth in 1673. Thereafter the term became common currency in English, though their detractors continued to label both Arian and Unitarian views as \\"Socinian\\". In 1565, the Diet (Sejm) of Piotrków excluded anti-Trinitarians from the existing synod of the Polish Reformed Church (henceforth the Ecclesia maior) and Unitarians began to hold their own synods as the Ecclesia minor. Known by various other names (of which Polish brethren and Arian were the most common), at no time in its history did this body adopt for itself any designation save \\"Christian\\". Originally Arian (but excluding any worship of Christ), and Anabaptist, the Minor Church was (by 1588) brought round to the views of Fausto Sozzini, who had settled in Poland in 1579, and who denied the pre-existence of Christ, while accepting the virgin birth (see Socinianism). In 1602 the nobleman Jakub Sienieński established among the non-Trinitarian community founded by his father at Raków, Kielce County the Racovian Academy and a printing-press, from which the Racovian Catechism was issued in 1605. In 1610 a Catholic reaction began, led by Jesuits. The establishment at Raków was suppressed in 1638, after two boys allegedly pelted a crucifix outside the town. For twenty years 1639-1659 the Arians were tolerated, but public opinion widely considered them as collaborators with Sweden during The Deluge, and in 1660 the Polish Diet gave anti-Trinitarians the option of conformity or exile. The Ecclesia minor or Minor Church included many Polish magnates, but their adoption of the views of Sozzini, which precluded Christians from magisterial office, rendered them politically powerless. The execution of the decree, hastened by a year, took place in 1660. Some conformed; a large number made their way to the Netherlands, where the Remonstrants admitted them to membership on the basis of the Apostles' Creed. Others, like Christopher Crell, went to the German frontier, Prussia and Lithuania. A contingent settled in Transylvania, not joining the Unitarian Church, but maintaining a distinct organization at Kolozsvár until 1793. The refugees who reached Amsterdam published the Bibliotheca fratrum polonorum (1665–1669), with the assistance of the Prussian emigre Christopher Sandius, embracing the works of Johannes Crellius, their leading theologian, Jonasz Szlichtyng, their chief Biblical commentator, Fausto Sozzini and Johann Ludwig von Wolzogen. The title page of this collection, bearing the words quos Unitarios vocant, introduced the term Unitarian to Western Europe. The term Unitarian (in Latin) was first used by Polish and Dutch Socinians from the 1660s.Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum quos Unitarios vocant (Library of the Polish Brethren who are called Unitarians 1665) =Transylvania and Hungary= John Sigismund of Hungary with Suleiman the Magnificent in 1556. The Unitarian Church in Dârjiu, Romania No distinct trace of anti-Trinitarian opinion precedes the appearance of Giorgio Biandrata at the Transylvanian court in 1563. His influence was exerted on Ferenc Dávid (1510–1579), who was successively Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist and finally anti-Trinitarian. Some argue that the growth of anti- Trinitarian opinion in Transylvania and Hungary may have partly been due to the growing Islamic influence of the expanding Ottoman Empire at the time. In 1564 Dávid was elected by the Calvinists as \\"bishop of the Hungarian churches in Transylvania\\", and appointed court preacher to John Sigismund, prince of Transylvania. His discussion of the Trinity began (1565) with doubts of the personality of the Holy Ghost. His antagonist in public disputations was the Calvinist leader, Peter Melius (Bishop of Debrecen 1558-1572); his supporter was Biandrata. John Sigismund, adopting his court-preacher's views, issued (1568) an edict of religious liberty at the Diet of Torda, which allowed Dávid (retaining his existing title) to transfer his episcopate from the Calvinists to the anti-Trinitarians, Kolozsvár being evacuated by all but his followers. In 1571 John Sigismund was succeeded by Stephen Báthory, a Catholic. Under the influence of Johann Sommer, rector of the Kolozsvár gymnasium, David (about 1572) abandoned the worship of Christ. The attempted accommodation by Fausto Sozzini only precipitated matters; tried as an innovator, Dávid died in prison at the Fortress of Déva (1579). The cultus of Christ became an established usage of the Church; it is recognized in the 1837 edition of the official hymnal, but removed in later editions. Interior of the Gothic church in Dârjiu The term unitarius made its first documentary appearance, unitaria religio, in a decree of the Diet of Lécfalva (1600); though it was not officially adopted by the Church until 1638. In 1618 the Unitarian Church condemned and withdrew from Simon Péchi and the Sabbatarians, a group with Judaic tendencies. The group continued to exist till the 1840s by which time many had converted to Judaism. In 1626 the Disciplina ecclesiastica was published by Bishop Bálint Radeczki (Latin: Valentinus Radecius, bishop 1616—1632). 1638 saw the Accord of Dés and suppression of the Unitarians. Of the line of twenty-three bishops the most distinguished were George Enyedi (1592–1597), whose Explicationes obtained European vogue, and Mihály Lombard de Szentábrahám (1737–1758), who rallied the forces of his Church, broken by persecution and deprivation of property, and gave them their traditional statement of faith. His Summa Universae Theologiae Christianae secundum Unitarios (published 1787), Socinian with Arminian modifications, was accepted by Joseph II as the official manifesto of doctrine, and so remains, though subscription to it has not been required since the 19th century. Inlăceni Hungarian Runes. Inscription (1668) reads \\"Egy az Isten Georgyius Musnai diakon\\", or \\"God is One Georgius Musnai deacon.\\" The first secondary school in Transylvania was established in the late 18th century in Székelykeresztúr (Cristuru Secuiesc); this functions to this day, although as a state school. The official title in Hungary is the Hungarian Unitarian Church, with a membership of about 25,000 members, whereas in Romania there is a separate church with the name of Unitarian Church of Transylvania and about 65,000 members, especially among the Székely population. In the past, the Unitarian bishop had a seat in the Hungarian parliament. The principal college of both churches is located at Cluj-Napoca (Kolozsvár), which is also the seat of the Transylvanian consistory; there were others at Turda (Torda) and at Cristuru Secuiesc. Until 1818 the continued existence of this body was largely unknown to English Unitarians ; relations subsequently became intimate. After 1860 a succession of students finished their theological education at Manchester College, Oxford; others at the Unitarian Home Missionary College. =England= Newington Green Unitarian Church, London, England. Built in 1708, this is the oldest non-conformist church in London still in use as a church. (October 2005) In England Unitarianism was a protestant sect that had its roots in the Anabaptist radicals of the English Civil War. They adopted adult baptism, and Godly republicanism; and they were egalitarians who sought to promote extreme revolutionary ideals. The movement gained popularity among dissenting nonconformists in the early 18th century. English Presbyterians were attracted to the second city at Norwich, by its emerging scientific community, which in the wake of the Enlightenment was particularly strong in Scotland. They began to become a formal denomination in 1774 when Theophilus Lindsey organized meetings with Joseph Priestley, founding the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in the country, at Essex Street Church in London. In 1791 Lindsey and his colleague John Disney were behind the \\"first organized denominational Unitarian society\\", formally The Unitarian Society for promoting Christian Knowledge and the Practice of Virtue by the Distribution of Books but more simply known as the Unitarian Book Society. This was followed by The Unitarian Fund (1806), which sent out missionaries and financially supported poorer congregations. Unitarianism was not fully legal in the United Kingdom until the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813, a bill largely pushed forward in Parliament by William Smith, and thus known sometimes under his name, or as the Unitarian Relief Act (Trinity Act) or The Unitarian Toleration Bill.Maclear J.F. Church and state in the modern age: a documentary history 1995 This did not grant them full civil rights while the oppressive Corporation Act and Test Act remained, and thus in 1819 the third significant Unitarian society was created, The Association for the Protection of the Civil Rights of Unitarians. In 1825 these three groups amalgamated into the British and Foreign Unitarian Association. A century later, this joined with the Sunday School Association to become the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, which remains today the umbrella organisation for British Unitarianism. Early beginnings Between 1548 (John Assheton) and 1612 we find few anti-Trinitarians, most of whom were either executed or forced to recant. Those burned included the Flemish surgeon George van Parris (1551); Patrick Pakingham (1555), a fellmonger; Matthew Hamont (1579), a ploughwright; John Lewes (1583); Peter Cole (1587), a tanner; Francis Kett (1589), physician and author; Bartholomew Legate (1612), a cloth-dealer and last of the Smithfield victims; and the twice-burned Edward Wightman (1612). In all these cases the anti-Trinitarian sentiments seem to have come from Holland; the last two executions followed the dedication to James I of the Latin version of the Racovian Catechism (1609). Socinian influence Fausto Sozzini had died on the road, after expulsion from Kraków, Poland on 4 March 1604, but the Racovian Academy and printing press continued till 1639, exerting influence in England via the Netherlands. The vogue of Socinian views, typified by men like Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland and Chillingworth, led to the abortive fourth canon of 1640 against Socinian books. The ordinance of 1648 made denial of the Trinity a capital offence, but it remained a dead letter, Cromwell intervening in the cases of Paul Best (1590–1657) and John Biddle (1616–1662). In 1652–1654 and 1658–1662 Biddle held a Socinian conventicle in London; in addition to his own writings he reprinted (1651) and translated (1652) the Racovian Catechism, and the Life of Socinus (1653). His disciple Thomas Firmin (1632–1697), mercer and philanthropist, and friend of John Tillotson, adopted the more Sabellian views of Stephen Nye (1648–1719), a clergyman. Firmin promoted a remarkable series of controversial tracts (1690–1699). In England the Socinian controversy, initiated by Biddle, preceded the Arian controversy initiated by Samuel Clarke's Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity (1712), although John Knowles was an Arian lay preacher at Chester in 1650. Arian or semi-Arian views had much vogue during the 18th century, both in the Church and among dissenters. \\"Unitarian\\" 1673 The word Unitarian had been circulating in private letters in England, in reference to imported copies of such publications as the Library of the Polish Brethren who are called Unitarians (1665), Henry Hedworth was the first to use the word \\"Unitarian\\" in print in English (1673), and the word first appears in a title in Stephen Nye's A brief history of the Unitarians, called also Socinians (1687). It was construed in a broad sense to cover all who, with whatever differences, held to the unipersonality of the Divine Being. Firmin later had a project of Unitarian societies \\"within the Church\\". Act of Toleration 1689 The first preacher to describe himself as Unitarian was Thomas Emlyn (1663–1741) who gathered a London congregation in 1705. This was contrary to the Act of Toleration 1689, which excluded all who should preach or write against the Trinity. In 1689 Presbyterians and Independents had coalesced, agreeing to drop both names and to support a common fund. The union in the London fund was ruptured in 1693; in course of time differences in the administration of the two funds led to the attaching of the Presbyterian name to theological liberals, though many of the older Unitarian chapels were Independent foundations, and at least half of the Presbyterian chapels (of 1690–1710) came into the hands of Congregationalists. Salters' Hall conference 1719 The free atmosphere of dissenting academies (colleges) favoured new ideas. The effect of the Salters' Hall conference (1719), called for by the views of James Peirce (1673–1726) of Exeter, was to leave dissenting congregations to determine their own orthodoxy; the General Baptists had already (1700) condoned defections from the common doctrine. Leaders in the advocacy of a purely humanitarian christology came largely from the Independents, such as Nathaniel Lardner (1684–1768), Caleb Fleming (1698–1779), Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) and Thomas Belsham (1750–1829). Isaac Newton was an anti- Trinitarian, and possibly a Unitarian (though he may have been Sabellian).See James Glick's biography Isaac Newton. One of his last visitors before his death in 1727 was Samuel Crellius from Lithuania. The Unitarian Church 1774 The formation of a distinct Unitarian denomination dates from the secession (1773) of Theophilus Lindsey (1723–1808) from the Anglican Church, on the failure of the Feathers petition to parliament (1772) for relief from subscription. Lindsey's secession had been preceded in Ireland by that of William Robertson D.D. (1705–1783), who has been called \\"the father of Unitarian nonconformity\\". It was followed by other clerical secessions, mostly of men who left the ministry, and Lindsey's hope of a Unitarian movement from the Anglican Church was disappointed. The congregation he established at Essex Street Chapel, with the assistance of prominent ministers such as Joseph Priestley and Richard Price, was a pivot for change. Legal difficulties with the authorities were overcome with the help of barrister John Lee, who later became Attorney-General. By degrees Lindsey's type of theology superseded Arianism in a considerable number of dissenting congregations. The Act of Toleration 1689 was amended (1779) by substituting belief in Scripture for belief in the Anglican (doctrinal) articles. In 1813 the penal acts against deniers of the Trinity were repealed by the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813, largely pushed through Parliament by William Smith, M.P., abolitionist, and grandfather of Florence Nightingale. In 1825 the British and Foreign Unitarian Association was formed as an amalgamation of three older societies, for literature (1791), mission work (1806) and civil rights (1818). Attacks were made on properties held by Unitarians, but created prior to 1813. The Wolverhampton Chapel case began in 1817, the more important Hewley Fund case in 1830; both were decided against the Unitarians in 1842. Appeal to parliament resulted in the Dissenters' Chapels Act (1844), which secured that, so far as trusts did not specify doctrines, twenty-five years tenure legitimated existing usage. The waning of the miraculous The period 1800-1850 is characterized by a shift in the British Unitarian movement's position from questioning the doctrine of the Trinity or the pre-existence of Christ to questioning the miraculous, inspiration of Scripture, and the virgin birth, though not yet at this point questioning the resurrection of Christ.R. K. Webb \\"Miracles in English Unitarian Thought\\" Essay, chapter 6 in Mark S. Micale, Robert L. Dietle, Peter Gay Enlightenment, passion, modernity: historical essays in European thought and culture 2000 Influence from America During the 19th century, the drier Priestley-Belsham type of Unitarianism, bound up with a determinist philosophy, was gradually modified by the influence of Channing (see below), whose works were reprinted in numerous editions and owed a wide circulation to the efforts of Robert Spears (1825–1899). Another American influence, potent in reducing the rigid though limited supernaturalism of Belsham and his successors, was that of Theodore Parker (1810–1860). At home the teaching of James Martineau (1805–1900), resisted at first, was at length powerfully felt, seconded as it was by the influence of John James Tayler (1797–1869) and of John Hamilton Thom (1808–1894). Notable people and institutions English Unitarianism produced some well-known scholars, e.g. John Kenrick (1788–1877), James Yates (1789–1871), Samuel Sharpe (1799–1881), but few popular preachers, though George Harris (1794–1859) is an exception. For the education of its ministry it supported Manchester College at Oxford (which deduced its ancestry from the academy of Richard Frankland, begun 1670), the Unitarian Home Missionary College (founded in Manchester in 1854 by John Relly Beard, D.D., and William Gaskell), and the Presbyterian College, Carmarthen. It also produced the notable Chamberlain family of politicians: Joseph Chamberlain, Austen Chamberlain, and Neville Chamberlain, and the Courtauld and Tate industrialist dynasties. Notable publications English Unitarian periodical literature begins with Priestley's Theological Repository (1769–1788), and includes the Monthly Repository (1806–1838), The Christian Reformer (1834–1863), The Christian Teacher (1835–1844), The Prospective Review (1845–1854), The National Review (1855–1864), the Theological Review (1864–1879), and The Hibbert Journal, one of the enterprises of the Hibbert Trust, founded by Robert Hibbert (1770–1849) and originally designated the Anti-Trinitarian Fund. This came into operation in 1853, awarded scholarships and fellowships, supported an annual lectureship (1878–1894), and maintained (from 1894) a chair of ecclesiastical history at Manchester College. =Scotland= Much has been made of the execution (1697) at Edinburgh of the student Thomas Aikenhead, convicted of blaspheming the Trinity. The works of John Taylor, D.D. (1694–1761) on original sin and atonement had much influence in the east of Scotland, as we learn from Robert Burns; and such men as William Dalrymple, D.D. (1723–1814) and William M'Gill, D.D. (1732–1807), along with other \\"moderates\\", were under suspicion of similar heresies. Overt Unitarianism has never had much vogue in Scotland. The only congregation of old foundation is at Edinburgh, founded in 1776 by a secession from one of the \\"fellowship societies\\" formed by James Fraser, of Brea (1639–1699). The mission enterprises of Richard Wright (1764–1836) and George Harris (1794–1859) produced results of no great permanence. The Scottish Unitarian AssociationScottish Unitarian Association was founded in 1813, mainly by Thomas Southwood Smith, M.D., the sanitary reformer. The McQuaker Trust was founded (1889) for propagandist purposes. Paradoxically, one of the reasons for the relative weakness of Unitarian movement in Scotland in the early 19th century may be the continuing presence of conservative, and therefore Bible- fundamentalist, non-Trinitarian, Arian, and Socinian views in dissenting chapels and among the Scottish followers of the Restoration Movement and Millerite movement. The Non-Trinitarian believers in Scotland were often more sympathetic to the Unitarians of a century earlier than to the more liberal views of Wright, Harris and Southwood Smith. A notable Bible-fundamentalist Scottish Unitarian was J. S. Hyndman, author of Lectures on The Principles of Unitarianism (Alnwick, 1824)JS Hyndman was formerly a student in Dr. Wardlaw's Theological Academy, Glasgow and in 1822 ministering at Call Lane Chapel, Leeds The Monthly repository of theology and general literature 1822 p520.

The Congregation is described in the Trust Deed as \\"a non-subscribing Congregation\\" which means it is a Congregation which deliberately abstains from formulating or insisting upon any creed or statement of belief.\\" Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow. =Ireland= Controversy respecting the Trinity was excited in Ireland by the prosecution at Dublin (1703) of Thomas Emlyn (see above), resulting in fine and imprisonment, for rejecting the deity of Christ. In 1705 the Belfast Society was founded for theological discussion by Presbyterian ministers in the north, with the result of creating a body of opinion adverse to subscription to the Westminster standards. Toleration of dissent, withheld in Ireland till 1719, was then granted without the requirement of any doctrinal subscription. Next year a movement against subscription was begun in the General Synod of Ulster, culminating (1725) in the placing of the advocates of non-subscription, headed by John Abernethy, D.D., of Antrim into a presbytery by themselves. This Presbytery of Antrim was excluded (1726) from jurisdiction, though not from communion. During the next hundred years its members exercised great influence on their brethren of the synod; but the counter-influence of the mission of the Scottish Seceders (from 1742) produced a reaction. The Antrim Presbytery gradually became Arian; the same type of theology affected more or less the Southern Association, known since 1806 as the Synod of Munster. From 1783 ten of the fourteen presbyteries in the Synod of Ulster had made subscription optional; the synod's code of 1824 left \\"soundness in the faith\\" to be ascertained by subscription or by examination. Against this compromise Henry Cooke, D.D. (1788–1868), directed all his powers, and was ultimately (1829) successful in defeating his Arian opponent, Henry Montgomery, LL.D. (1788–1865). Montgomery led a secession which formed (1830) the Remonstrant Synod of Ulster, comprising three presbyteries. In 1910 the Antrim Presbytery, Remonstrant Synod and Synod of Munster united as the General Synod of the Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland, with 38 congregations and some mission stations. Till 1889 they maintained two theological chairs in Belfast, where John Scott Porter (1801–1880) pioneered biblical criticism; they afterwards sent their students to England for their theological education, though in certain respects their views and practices remained more conservative than those of their English brethren. Irish Unitarian periodical literature began in 1832 with the Bible Christian, followed by the Irish Unitarian Magazine, the Christian Unitarian, the Disciple and the Non-subscribing Presbyterian.

(1895). =United States= The history of Unitarian thought in the United States can be roughly divided into four periods: * a period of precursor movements (early 18th century to c. 1800) * the formative period (c. 1800-1835) * a Transcendentalist period (c. 1835-1885) * the modern period (since 1885) Precursor movements and early Unitarianism Unitarianism in the United States followed essentially the same development as in England, and passed through the stages of Arminianism, Arianism, to rationalism and a modernism based on an acceptance of the results of the comparative study of all religions. In the early 18th century Arminianism presented itself in New England, and sporadically elsewhere. This tendency was largely accelerated by a backlash against the \\"Great Awakening\\" under Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield. Before the War of Independence Arianism showed itself in individual instances, and French influences were widespread in the direction of deism, though they were not organized into any definite utterance by religious bodies. As early as the middle of the 18th century Harvard College represented the most advanced thought of the time, and a score or more of clergymen in New England preached what was essentially Unitarianism. The most prominent of these men was Jonathan Mayhew (1720–1766), pastor of the West Church in Boston, Massachusetts, from 1747 to 1766. He preached the strict unity of God, the subordinate nature of Christ, and salvation by character. Charles Chauncy (1705–1787), pastor of the First Church from 1727 until his death, the chief opponent of Edwards in the great revival, was both a Unitarian and a Universalist. Other Unitarians included Ebenezer Gay (1698–1787) of Hingham, Samuel West (1730–1807) of New Bedford, Thomas Barnard (1748–1814) of Newbury, John Prince (1751–1836) and William Bentley (1758–1819) of Salem, Aaron Bancroft (1755–1836) of Worcester, and several others. The first official acceptance of the Unitarian faith on the part of a congregation was by King's Chapel in Boston, which settled James Freeman (1759–1835) in 1782, and revised the Prayer Book into a mild Unitarian liturgy in 1785. The Rev. William Hazlitt (father of the essayist and critic), visiting the United States in 1783–1785, published the fact that there were Unitarians in Philadelphia, Boston, Charleston, Pittsburgh, Hallowell, on Cape Cod, and elsewhere. Unitarian congregations were organized at Portland and Saco in 1792 by Thomas Oxnard; in 1800 the First Church in Plymouth—the congregation founded by the Pilgrims in 1620—accepted the more liberal faith. Joseph Priestley emigrated to the United States in 1794, and organized a Unitarian Church at Northumberland, Pennsylvania, the same year and one at Philadelphia in 1796. His writings had a considerable influence. Thus from 1725 to 1825, Unitarianism was gaining ground in New England, and to some extent elsewhere. The first distinctive manifestation of the change was the inauguration of Henry Ware (1764–1845) as professor of divinity at Harvard College, in 1805. In the same year appeared Unitarian books by John Sherman (1772–1828) and another in 1810 by Noah Worcester (1758–1837). At the opening of the 19th century, with one exception, all the churches of Boston were occupied by Unitarian preachers, and various periodicals and organizations expressed their opinions. Churches were established in New York City, Baltimore, Washington, Charleston, and elsewhere during this period. Formative period The next period of American Unitarianism, from about 1800 to about 1835, can be thought of as formative, mainly influenced by English philosophy, semi-supernatural, imperfectly rationalistic, devoted to philanthropy and practical Christianity. Dr. Channing was its distinguished exponent. The first official acceptance of the Unitarian faith on the part of a congregation in America was by King's Chapel in Boston, which took James Freeman (1759–1853) as its pastor in 1782, and revised the Prayer Book into a mild Unitarian liturgy in 1785. In 1800, Joseph Stevens Buckminster became minister of the Brattle Street Church in Boston, where his brilliant sermons, literary activities, and academic attention to the German \\"New Criticism\\" helped shape the subsequent growth of Unitarianism in New England. Unitarian Henry Ware (1764–1845) was appointed as the Hollis professor of divinity at Harvard College, in 1805. Harvard Divinity school then shifted from its conservative roots to teach Unitarian theology.Gary J. Dorrien.

Field Ralph Waldo Emerson: The Making of a Democratic Intellectual Rowman & Littlefield, 2003ISBN 978-0847688425 Buckminster's close associate William Ellery Channing (1780–1842) became pastor of the Federal Street Church in Boston, 1803; in a few years he became the leader of the Unitarian movement. At first mystical rather than rationalistic in his theology, he took part with the \\"Catholic Christians\\", as they called themselves, who aimed at bringing Christianity into harmony with the progressive spirit of the time. His essays on The System of Exclusion and Denunciation in Religion (1815) and Objections to Unitarian Christianity Considered (1819) made him a defender of Unitarianism. His sermon on \\"Unitarian Christianity\\", preached at First Unitarian Church of Baltimore in 1819, at the ordination of Jared Sparks, and that at New York in 1821, made him its interpreter. The result of the \\"Unitarian Controversy\\" (1815)George Ellis A Half-century of the Unitarian Controversy Boston 1857George Edward Ellis (1814-1894). By Samuel J. Barrows. George Edward Ellis Courtesy of Andover-Harvard Theological Library, Harvard Divinity School was a growing division in the Congregational churches, which was emphasized in 1825 by the formation of the American Unitarian Association at Boston. It was organized \\"to diffuse the knowledge and promote the interests of pure Christianity\\" and it published tracts and books, supported poor churches, sent out missionaries into every part of the country, and established new churches in nearly all the states. Essentially non-sectarian, with little missionary zeal, the Unitarian movement has grown slowly, and its influence had chiefly operated through general culture and the literature of the country. Many of its clergymen had been trained in other denominations, but the Harvard Divinity School was distinctly Unitarian from its formation, in 1816, until 1870, when it became a non-sectarian department of the university. The Meadville Lombard Theological School was founded at Meadville, Pennsylvania in 1844, and the Starr King School for the Ministry at Berkeley, California in 1904. The History of Essex Hall, written in 1959 by Mortimer Rowe, the Secretary (i.e. chief executive) of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches for its first twenty years, claims that the BFUA and AUA were founded entirely coincidentally on the same day, 26 May 1825.\\"By a happy coincidence, in those days of slow posts, no transatlantic telegraph, telephone or wireless, our American cousins, in complete ignorance as to the details of what was afoot, though moving towards a similar goal, founded the American Unitarian Association on precisely the same day - May 26, 1825.\\" Influence of Transcendentalism; reaction A third period (see Transcendentalism), from about 1835 to about 1885, profoundly influenced by German idealism, was increasingly rationalistic, though its theology was largely flavoured by mysticism.Tiffany K. Wayne Encyclopedia of Transcendentalism 2006 p179 As a reaction against this, the National Unitarian Conference was organized in 1865, and adopted a distinctly Christian platform, affirming that its members were \\"disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ\\". The more rationalistic minority thereupon formed the Free Religious Association, \\"to encourage the scientific study of theology and to increase fellowship in the spirit.\\" The Western Unitarian Conference later accepted the same position, and based its \\"fellowship on no dogmatic tests, but affirmed a desire \\"to establish truth, righteousness and love in the world.\\" In addition, the WUC claimed belief in God was not a necessary component of Unitarian belief. This period of controversy and of vigorous theological development practically came to an end soon after 1885. Its cessation was assured by the action of the national conference at Saratoga, New York in 1894, when it was affirmed by a nearly unanimous vote that: \\"These churches accept the religion of Jesus, holding, in accordance with his teaching, that practical religion is summed up in love to God and love to man. The conference recognizes the fact that its constituency is Congregational in tradition and polity. Therefore it declares that nothing in this constitution is to be construed as an authoritative test; and we cordially invite to our working fellowship any who, while differing from us in belief, are in general sympathy with our spirit and our practical aims.\\" The leaders of this period were Ralph Waldo Emerson with his idealism and Theodore Parker with his acceptance of Christianity as absolute religion. Modern period The fourth period, beginning about 1885, has been one of rationalism, recognition of universal religion, large acceptance of the scientific method and ideas and an ethical attempt to realize what was perceived as to be the higher affirmations of Christianity. It has been marked by a general harmony and unity, by steady growth in the number of churches and by a widening fellowship with all other similarly minded movements. This phase was shown in the organization of The International Council of Unitarian and other Liberal Religious Thinkers and Workers at Boston on 25 May 1900, \\"to open communication with those in all lands who are striving to unite pure religion and perfect liberty, and to increase fellowship and co-operation among them.\\" This council has held biennial sessions in London, Amsterdam, Geneva and Boston. During the period after 1885 the influence of Emerson became predominant, modified by the more scientific preaching of Minot Judson Savage, who found his guides in Darwin and Spencer. Beyond its own borders the body obtained recognition through the public work of such men as Henry Whitney Bellows and Edward Everett Hale, the remarkable influence of James Freeman Clarke and Thomas Lamb Eliot, and the popular power of Robert Collyer. The number of Unitarian churches in the United States in 1909 was 461, with 541 ministers. The church membership then, really nominal, may be estimated at 100,000. The periodicals were The Christian Register, weekly, Boston; Unity, weekly, Chicago; The Unitarian, monthly, New York; Old and New, monthly, Des Moines; Pacific Unitarian, San Francisco. In 1961, the American Unitarian Association merged with the Universalist Church of America, forming the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA). Strictly speaking, modern-day Unitarian Universalism is not Unitarian in theology. Despite its name, this denomination does not necessarily promote either belief in One God or universal salvation. It is merely the inheritor of the Unitarian and Universalist church system in America. Though there are Unitarians within the UUA, there is no creed or doctrine that one must affirm to join a Unitarian Universalist congregation. This makes it very different from many other faith groups. Today, the majority of Unitarian Universalists do not identify themselves as Christians.See the results of a recent poll on theological self- identity among UUs in the Engaging Our Theological Diversity report, pp. 70–72. Jesus and the Bible are generally treated as exceptional sources of inspiration, along with the holy people and traditions around the world. Unitarian Universalists base their community on a set of Principles and Purposes rather than on a prophet or creed. Notable Unitarian Universalists include Tim Berners-Lee (founder of the World Wide Web), Pete Seeger, U. S. Congressman Pete Stark, former U. S. Senator Mike Gravel and Christopher Reeve. The decline of specifically Christian theology in the Unitarian churches in the United States has prompted several revival movements. Unitarian Christians within the UUA formed, the Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship (UUCF) in 1945, a fellowship within UUA just for Christians, who were gradually becoming a minority. Similarly, the American Unitarian Conference (AUC) was founded in 2000 with 4 congregations, but unlike the UUCF, the AUC remains outside the UUA. The AUC's mission is \\"renewal of the historic Unitarian faith\\", and promotes a set of God-centered religious principles, but like Unitarian Universalism, it does not impose a creed on its members. Unitarians in America, because of the developments with the Unitarian churches, have generally taken one of three courses of action to find communities in which to worship God. Some have stayed within the Unitarian churches, accepting the non-Christian nature of their congregation, but have found their needs met in the UUCF. Some Unitarians, because they felt that the mainstream UUA churches are not accepting of Christians, or that the larger Unitarian Universalist organizations are becoming too political and liberal to be considered a religious movement or faith, have decided to affiliate with the American Unitarian Conference. Most Christian Unitarians have sought out liberal Christian churches in other denominations and have made homes there.According to a 2002 survey published by the Barna Group (http://www.barna.org/FlexPage.aspx?Page=BarnaUpdate&BarnaUpdateID;=122), only 79% of Christians in the United States believe God is one being in three separate and equal persons—God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son and the Holy Spirit. According to the 2001 US Census, section 79 (https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/03statab/pop.pdf), 159,506,000 adults identify themselves as Christians. This would mean that, circa 2001-2002, 33,496,000 American Christians (21% of 159,506,000) were nontrinitarian, a number some ten times greater than the number of Christians in the UUA. =Canada= Unitarianism arrived in Canada from Iceland and Britain. Some Canadian congregations had services in Icelandic into living memory. The first Unitarian service in Canada was held in 1832 by a minister from England, Rev, David Hughes, in a school owned by the Workman family, who were Unitarians from Belfast. The Montreal congregation, founded in 1842, called their first permanent minister, the Rev. John Cordner, of the Remonstrant Synod of Ulster; he arrived in 1843 and served as their minister for thirty-six years. Then in 1845, a congregation in Toronto was founded whose first minister, William Adam, was a Scottish Baptist missionary who had served in India. Then other congregations formed, Hamilton in 1889, Ottawa in 1898, the First Icelandic Unitarian Church in Winnipeg in 1891, a congregation in Vancouver in 1909 and a congregation in Victoria in 1910. Individual Canadian congregations had ties to the British association until they were disrupted by World War II, when relations to Unitarians in the United States became stronger. Universalism found its way to Canada during the 19th century, for the most part, though not entirely, brought by settlers from the United States. The Universalist concepts of universal reconciliation, a loving and forgiving God, and the brother/sisterhood of all people, were welcomed by those for whom the partialist view or predestination were no longer acceptable. Universalist congregations formed, with the exception of the congregation in Halifax in 1837, mostly in rural towns and villages in lower Quebec and the Maritimes, and in southern Ontario. Universalism in Canada followed a corresponding decline as in the United States, and today the three remaining congregations at Olinda, Ontario founded in 1880, North Hatley, Quebec founded in 1886, and Halifax, Nova Scotia have since the 1960s been part of the Canadian Unitarian Council (CUC). The CUC was formed on May 14, 1961, one day before the UUA in the United States, but the two functioned in close association until money exchange and other complications led to greater independence, with the CUC in 2002 assuming the direct delivery of services to Canadian congregations which was formerly delivered by the UUA. The UUA continues to provide ministerial settlement services to CUC member congregations. The Unitarian Service Committee, established during World War II as an overseas emergency relief agency, began under the capable direction of Dr. Lotta Hitschmanova and initially supported largely by Unitarians, now continues as a separate agency called USC Canada which draws support throughout Canada for its humanitarian work in many parts of the world. The first ordination of a Canadian Unitarian minister after the organizational separation of the CUC and the UUA was held at the First Unitarian Church of Victoria, British Columbia, in 2002. Rev. Brian Kiely, who was to give the ordination sermon, was told (partly in jest) he must define Canadian Unitarianism, as Rev. Channing had at that New England ordination sermon of 1819. The simile Rev. Kiely chose was that Canadian Unitarianism is like a doughnut, the richness is in the circle of fellowship, not a creedal centre. Modern period =20th century= In 1928 the British and Foreign Unitarian Association merged with the Sunday School Association, with which it had been sharing offices for decades, as the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches. The General Assembly is still the umbrella organisation for British Unitarianism, which has its headquarters, Essex Hall, in the same place in central London. =21st century= In May 2004 Rev. Peter Hughes, vice-chairman of the East Lancashire Unitarian Mission, and a minister at Chowbent Chapel founded in 1645 in Atherton, Greater Manchester, published an article in the movement's journal, The Inquirer, and gave an interview to The Times where he warned of the extinction of the Unitarian Church. According to The Times, \\"the church has fewer than 6,000 members in Britain; half of whom are aged over 65.\\" He added, referring to Toxteth Chapel in Liverpool, the movement's oldest building, where he was brought up, \\"they have had no minister since 1976 and the Unitarian cause there is effectively dead.\\" The denomination's president, Dawn Buckle, a retired lecturer in education, denied that the movement was in a terminal phase and described it as a \\"thriving community capable of sustaining growth\\".. There are more than 180 Unitarian congregations in Britain as part of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches.unitarian.org.uk Entirely separate from the General Assembly, and generally with no historical descent from the British and Foreign Unitarian Association (1825–1928), there are a number of other denominations and small groups which look to earlier periods of Unitarianism as influences. This includes both groups looking back to the early Polish, Dutch and English \\"Socinians\\" of the 17th century such as the Restoration Fellowship of Sir Anthony Buzzard, 3rd Baronet, and those looking to the later \\"biblical unitarianism\\" of Robert Spears. Many of these groups are nontrinitarian in theology, liberal in some political areas - such as conscientious objection, but fundamentalist in regard to the Bible, and conservative in areas such as homosexuality or women priests. Some of these groups however do have women ministers.Unitarian Ministries International Recently some religious groups have adopted the term \\"Biblical Unitarianism\\" to distinguish their theology from modern liberal Unitarianism.Tuggy, Dale, (2009). Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. =Unitarianism's spread to other countries= Germany There are currently four separate groups of Unitarians in Germany: :* The Unitarische Freie Religionsgemeinde (Unitarian Free Religious Community, then called German Catholics) was founded in 1845 in Frankfurt am Main.Willkommen bei www.unitarier.net :* The Religionsgemeinschaft Freier Protestanten (\\"Religious Community of Free Protestants\\") was formed in 1876 in Germany's Rheinhessen region. in 1911 their newspaper took on the subtitle \\"deutsch- unitarische Blätter\\" (\\"German Unitarian Gazette\\") as leader Rudolf Walbaum wanted to connect to American Unitarians. After the Second World War, several groups with close ties to the Nazi Party and to the Nazi ideology started migrating to this group and occupying its decision-making organs.Peter Kratz, Die Götter des New Age Berlin, 1994, chapter fiveAli Gronner. Der lange Weg vom Unitas - Arier zum Unitarier - Bemerkungen zu den Deutschen Unitariern, pub Austrian Unitarian Universalist Forum website, 17 November 2011. Most of the original \\"Free Protestants\\" then left the movement, which in 1950 changed itarias name to Deutsche Unitarier Religionsgemeinschaft (\\"German Unitarian Religious Community\\"). The organization´s leaders and most of its members came from those Nazi groups and it was firmly anchored in the extreme far-right German scene well into the 1980s. It is the only Unitarian group in Germany to belong to the ICUU :*The Unitarische Kirche in Berlin (Unitarian Church in Berlin) was founded by Hansgeorg Remus in 1948.Unitarische Kirche :*The Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Frankfurt is an international, English- speaking liberal religious community serving the Rhein-Main area. It is part of the European Unitarian Universalists. Denmark In 1900 Det fri Kirkesamfund (literally, The Free Congregation) was founded by a group of liberal Christians in Copenhagen. Since 1908, the church is outside the Folkekirke (the Danish Lutheran state church). In Aarhus, another Unitarian congregation was founded at this time by the Norwegian Unitarian pastor and writer Kristofer Janson (1841–1917); it has since closed. Often labeled and considered as a \\"pioneer\\" or \\"precursor\\" See e.g. Ágúst H. Bjarnason, \\"Magnus Eiriksson, the first Icelandic Unitarian\\" (Lecture at Harvard Divinity School, 21 May 1923), handwritten manuscript, transcribed and edited by St. M.

See also Eiríkssons articles in the Swedish periodical Sanningssökaren, which was published by the Unitarian association Sanningenssökarna, e.g.\\"Förnuftstro och kyrkolära. Bref från a gammal sanningsökare\\", in Sanningssökaren (1877), pp. 41-47. (in a spiritual manner) to the Unitarian movement in Denmark was the Icelandic theologian Magnús Eiríksson (1806–1881), who lived in Copenhagen from 1831 until his death in 1881. Sweden Inspired by the writings of Theodore Parker the Swedish writer Klas Pontus Arnoldson founded in Gothenburg in 1871 the Unitarian association Sanningssökarna (\\"The Truth Seekers\\") – later also found in Stockholm. This association also published the periodical Sanningssökaren (\\"The Truth Seeker\\"). Two other Unitarian associations were founded in 1882 (one of them in Stockholm). In 1888 Unitarians asked the Swedish King for permission to establish yet another Unitarian association in Gothenburg but was turned down because Unitarianism was not regarded as a Christian religion. Later many Unitarians turned to theosophy. In 1974 members of The Religion and Culture Association in Malmö founded The Free Church of Sweden and Rev. Ragnar Emilsen would be its pastor (ordained 1987 to Unitarian minister for Sweden and Finland and later the first to become Unitarian bishop of Scandinavia, he died February 2008). In 1999 the church changed its name to The Unitarian Church in Sweden. Norway In 1892 and 1893 the Norwegian Unitarian ministers Hans Tambs Lyche and Kristofer Janson returned from America and at once started independently of each other to introduce Unitarianism. In 1894 Tambs Lyche failed to organize a Unitarian Church in Oslo (then Kristiania) but managed to publish Norway's first Unitarian periodical (Free Words). In January 1895 Kristofer Janson founded The Church of Brotherhood in Oslo which was to be the first Unitarian church – where he stayed as the congregation's pastor only for 3 years. In 1904 Herman Haugerud was to return to Norway from America and to become the last Unitarian pastor to The Unitarian Society (which The Church of Brotherhood now was renamed). Pastor Haugerud died in 1937 and the Unitarian church ceased to exist shortly thereafter. Between 1986 and 2003 different Unitarian groups were active in Oslo. In 2004 these merged into The Unitarian Association which registered as religious society according to Norwegian law on 20 April 2005 under the name The Unitarian Association (The Norwegian Unitarian Church). Later \\"Bét Dávid\\" has been added to the name: The Bét Dávid Unitarian Association (The Norwegian Unitarian Church).http://unitarforbundet.org/ The church is akin to both Transylvanian Unitarianism and Judaism, hence the name bét referring to the Hebrew word for \\"house\\" and Dávid which is the name of the first Transylvanian Unitarian bishop Dávid Ferenc (1510–1579). In 2006 this church was associated with the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists (ICUU). Since 2007 there is also a Unitarian Universalist Fellowshiphttp://unitar.no independent of The Norwegian Unitarian Church. This fellowship is located in the Oslo area. Spain Although the pioneer and first martyr of European Unitarianism was a Spaniard, Michael Servetus, the Spanish Inquisition and the religious hegemony of the Roman Catholic Church over both the State and the Spanish society, blocked for centuries any possibility of developing a Unitarian Church in Spain. This situation began to change in the 19th century. A liberal Spanish writer and former priest, José María Blanco-White, became a Unitarian during his exile in England and remained so until the end of his life (1841). At the end of the century, a group of liberal Spanish intellectuals and reformers, the Krausistas (who received this name for being followers of German idealist philosopher Karl Krause), were admirers of American Unitarian leaders William Ellery Channing and Theodore Parker, and wished that natural religion and religious rationalism were more present in Spain, although they did not create any liberal church to push that process forward. The Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) put an end to any expectations of change and liberal developments in Spain for several decades. After the death of dictator Francisco Franco and the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978, religious freedom was finally established in Spain (although still with many restrictions in actual practice). In 2000, the Sociedad Unitaria Universalista de España (SUUE) was founded in Barcelona, and in 2001 it became a member of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists (ICUU). In 2005 it changed its name to the Unitarian Universalist Religious Society of Spain in order to achieve legal status as a religious organization under the Spanish law on Religious Freedom, but the application was also rejected.

As explained by Sir Henry Yule, the editor of an English edition of Marco Polo's travels: \\"Some geographers of the 16th century, following the old editions which carried the travellers south-east of Java to the land of Boeach (or Locac), introduced in their maps a continent in that situation\\".(Sir Henry Yule (ed.), The Book of Ser Marco Polo, London, Murray, 1921, Vol.II, pp.276-280) Jean Alfonse's cosmography Representation of Grande Jave (Australia) in the 16th century (top left of the map, indication of the islands of Sumatra and Jave (Java)) Java Minor was identified as an island (the present Island of Java) by the Franco-Portuguese navigator and cosmographer Jean Alfonse in his work of 1544, La Cosmographie but Java Major according to him was part of the continent of Terra Australis, which extended as far as the Antarctic Pole and the Strait of Magellan. In La Cosmographie, Alfonse defined La Grande Jave as an extension of the giant Antarctic continent, or Terra Australis: \\"This Java touches the Straight of Magellan in the west, and in the east Terra Australis ...

See also the entry on Alfonse in Dictionnaire de Biographie française, Paris, 1933, p. 1491. Apparently in deference to Marco Polo's claim that Java Major was the largest island in the world, Alfonse gave the name Jave Mynore to the island of Java and the name La Grand Jave to the continental land to the south. Marco Polo's Java Minor, he called Samatrez (Sumatra). In La Cosmographie (1544), Alfonse said: > La Grand Jave is a land that goes as far as under the Antarctic Pole and > from the Terre Australle in the west to the land of the Strait of Magellan > on the eastern side. Some say that it is islands but from what I have seen > of it, it is terre ferme [a continent] ...

Later cartography This cosmographical concept was exhibited in the mid- sixteenth century mappemondes of the School of mapmakers centred at Dieppe, Normandy, which in later times gave rise to the idea that Australia may have been discovered by Europeans long before the Dutch began to chart its coast in 1606 or before James Cook charted its east coast in 1770. This is seen clearly in Jean Rotz's Lande of Java of 1542, the Dauphin Map or Harleyan World Map of c. 1547,Dauphin Map [Harley World Map, France; 1547] and in Pierre Desceliers' mappemonde of 1546.Desceliers' 1546 mappemonde is held at the John Rylands Library, University of Manchester, and may be viewed at: rylibweb.man.ac.uk/specialcollections/guide/atoz/frenchms Alfonse's map of La Grande Jave bears a striking resemblance to that of Rotz. Details of the map of the Grande Jave by Nicolas Vallard (1547) Vincenzo Coronelli, on his Terrestrial Globe made in Venice in 1688, referred to the uncertainty regarding the location of Marco Polo's Java Minor, noting that while in the opinion of some it could be identified with Sumatra, others believed it to be Sumbawa or New Holland. His inscription reads: \\"Various are the opinions of the Geographers concerning the location of Giava minore, some placing it under the Tropic of Capricorn, in accordance with what Marco Polo wrote in bk.3, cap.13. Others believe it to be Sumatra from the distance which the same Polo assigned to it, others take it for the Island of Sumbawa, and some others, more modern, for New Holland. We, from so much variety of opinion, do not offer a final conclusion on the matter, leaving the dispute undecided.\\"\\"Della Giava Minore. Varie sono appresso li Geografi l'opinioni del sito della Giava minore, collocando la alcuni sotto il Tropico di Capricorno secondo quello, che Marco Polo Patrizio Veneto scrive nel lib. 3 cap 13. altri credendola la Sumatra per le distanza, che n'assegna il medisimo Polo, altri volendola per l'Isola Çumbava, e qualch'altra de piu Moderni per la Nuova Hollanda. Noi tra le tante varietà le pareri non terminando cos' alcuna, lasciano la contesa indecisa\\". Map of the Grande Jave by Pierre Desceliers (1550) In accordance with the uncorrected editions of Marco Polo's travels, on his 1688 Terrestrial Globe Coronelli inscribed over the northern part of Nuova Hollandia: \\"Some believe that in this place M. Polo discovered the Land of Lochac, and that 500 miles further on is found the Island of Pentan, and the Kingdom of Malaiur.\\"\\"Credono alcuni scoperti in questo luogo da M. Polo il Paese di Lochac, e ch’avanzandosi 500. Miglia, trovasse l'Is. Pentã, et il Regno di Malaiur, dei quali non havendo sene contezza maggiore, oltre le relationi del med°. l. 2. C. 8. e. 9. raccolte da Ramusio nel 2. Vol.\\" As a result of this mis-placement southwards of the lands and islands described by Marco Polo, Coronelli and others confused Java Minor, Polo's name for Sumatra, with New Holland (Australia). This confusion was greater on the earlier Dieppe maps of the 1540s where Java Minor and Java Major (Jave la Grande) were transposed, apparently in accordance with Marco Polo's statement that Java Major was \\"the greatest island in the world\\". In the Dieppe maps, Jave la Grande was made a part of the Antarctic continent, Terra Australis.Robert J. King, \\"The Jagiellonian Globe, Utopia and Jave la Grande\\", Globe Studies, No. 55/56 (2009, for 2007/2008), pp. 39-52. Marco Polo's placenames Lochac (or Locach) was Marco Polo's rendition of the Chinese (Cantonese) Lo-huk, which was how they referred to the southern Thai kingdom of Lavapura, or Louvo (from Sanskrit Lavo, the present Lopburi \\"city of Lavo\\", after Lavo, in Hindu mythology the son of Rama: Lavo in Thai is spelled Lab, pronounced Lop'h; hence the name Lop'haburī, or Lop'ha-purī (Lopburi)). Louvo was united with Siam in 1350.G. E. Gerini, Researches on Ptolemy's geography of Eastern Asia (further India and Indo-Malay archipelago), London, Royal Asiatic Society, Asiatic Society Monographs vol.1, 1909, p.180. Lopburi was a province of the Khmer empire in Marco Polo's time, and he may have used \\"Locach\\" to refer to Cambodia.William Marsden, The Travels of Marco Polo, London, 1818, p. 362. The golden spires of Angkor, the capital of the Khmer empire, would have been a more likely inspiration of Marco's comment on the gold of Locach than the Lopburi of his time. 1570 map by Abraham Ortelius, TYPUS ORBIS TERRARUM (Figure of the Terrestrial Globe) depicting \\"Terra Australis Nondum Cognita\\" as a large continent on the bottom of the map and also an Arctic continent. South of Nova Guinea, the continent bears the inscription, Hanc continentem Australem, nonnulli Magellanicam regionem ab eius inventore nuncupant (This Austral continent is called by some the Magellanic region, after its discoverer). As Zhou Daguan, the ambassador sent by the Yuan court to Cambodia in 1296 commented: \\"These [golden towers] are the monuments that have caused merchants from overseas to speak so often of 'Zhenla [Cambodia] the rich and noble.Chou Ta-kuan 周達観 (Zhou Daguan, fl.1297), Customs of Cambodia 風土記 , transl. Paul Pelliot and J. Gilman d'Arcy Paul, Bangkok, Siam Society, 1993, p. 2. The imprisonment by the Khmer ruler Jayavarman VIII of a Mongol emissary in 1281Chou Ta-kuan 周達観 (Zhou Daguan, fl.1297), Customs of Cambodia 風土記 , transl. Paul Pelliot and J. Gilman d’Arcy Paul, Bangkok, Siam Society, 1993, pp.xviii-xix. \\"These [golden towers] are the monuments that have caused merchants from overseas to speak so often of 'Cambodia the rich and noble; ibid., p. 2. would have been ample justification for Marco's remark on the inhumanity of its people: he said that Locach \\"was such a savage place that few people ever go there\\", and that \\"the king himself does not want anyone to go there or to spy out his treasure or the state of his realm\\". Marco also noted the abundance of elephants in Locach; Locach was notable in the Chinese annals for sending elephants as tribute.Paul Pelliot, Notes on Marco Polo, Paris, Imprimerie Nationale, 1963, Vol.II, p.554, note 2. Paul Wheatley, \\"Lochac Revisited\\", Oriens Extremus, vol.16, 1969, pp.85-110. Beach, as a mistranscription of Locach, originated with the 1532 editions of the Novus Orbis Regionum by Simon Grynaeus and Johann Huttich, in which Marco Polo's Locach was changed to Boëach, which was later shortened to Beach.Simon Grynaeus and Johann Huttich, Novus Orbis Regionum, Basel and Paris, 1532, Marco Polo cap.xi, \\"De provincia Boëach\\"; cited in Thomas Suarez, Early Mapping of Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Periplus, 1999, p.160. Pentan is the island of Bintan, and Malaiur was the old Tamil name for the Sumatran city of Jambi (and is the origin of the national name Malay).Sir Henry Yule (ed.), The Book of Ser Marco Polo, London, Murray, 1921, Vol.II, pp.280-283 Jave la Grande as a composite of Regio Patalis and Brasielie Regio Robert J. King has suggested that Alfonse's description of La Grande Jave could also fit the Regio Patalis promontory on Oronce Fine's world map, and indicates that the Dieppe Maps appear to have conflated Marco Polo's Greater Java with Fine's Regio Patalis and Brasielie Regio.Robert J. King, \\"The Jagiellonian Globe, a Key to the Puzzle of Jave la Grande\\", The Globe, no. 62, 2009, pp. 1-50. A high-resolution image of Fine's 1531 world map, Nova Universi Orbis Descriptio, can be found at: On the Dieppe Maps, the great promontory of JAVE LA GRANDE (Greater Java) extends, like the Regio Patalis, northward from the Austral continent. The evolution of Fine's REGIO PATALIS into JAVE LA GRANDE may have been influenced by the phrase used by Ludovico di Varthema, an Italian from Bologna who made a voyage in 1505 from Borneo to Java, who said that Java \\"prope in inmensum patet\\" (\\"extends almost beyond measure\\").Simon Grynaeus and Johann Huttich, Novus Orbis Regionum, Basel, 1532, Ludovico di Varthema, Itinerario, p.271; cited in Franz von Wieser, Magalhães-Strasse und Austral-Continent. Auf den Globen Johannes Schöner. Beitrage zur Geschichte der Erdkunde im xvi. Jahrhundert, Innsbruck, 1881 (reprinted Amsterdam, Meridian, 1967), p. 67. Although the word patet (\\"extends\\") has no connection with the city of Patala (now Thatta) at the mouth of the Indus River, which gave its name to the Regio Patalis (\\"Region of Patala\\"), the Dieppe mapmakers may have misunderstood the name to mean \\"the Extensive Region\\". Ludovico di Varthema also said that he had been told by the captain of the ship in which he had made the voyage from Borneo that on the southern side of Java Major, to the southward, \\"there are peoples who sail with their backs to our stars of the north until they find a day of but 4 hours, where the day does not last more than four hours\\", and that there it was colder than in any other part of the world.Ludovico di Varthema, Book 3, On India, Chapter 27; George Percy Badger (ed.) and John Winter Jones (transl.), The travels of Ludivico di Varthema in Egypt, Syria, Arabia Deserta and Arabia Felix, in Persia, India, and Ethiopia, A.D. 1503 to 1508, translated from the original Italian edition of 1510, London, Hakluyt Society, 1863, \\"The Chapter showing how the Mariners manage the Navigation towards the Island of Java\\". The region where the shortest day would only last four hours would be in latitude 63° South. This could explain Jean Alfonse's description of La Grande Jave as an extension of the giant Antarctic continent: \\"This Java touches the Straight of Magellan in the west, and in the east Terra Australis ... I estimate that the coast of the Ocean Sea called the Austral coast extends eastwards [from the Straight of Magellan] to Java, to the western coast of the said Java\\".\\"Cest Jave tient en occident au destroict de Magaillan, et en orient à la terre Australle ... J'estime que cest coste de la mer Occéane qu'est dicte coste Australle se va rendre en Oriant, à la Jave, du cousté d'occident de ladicte Jave\\". Jean Alfonse, La Cosmographie, ff.150v and 159r, in Georges Musset (ed.), Receuil de Voyages et de Documents pour servir à l’Histoire de la Géographie, XX, Paris, 1904, pp.399 and 427. See also the entry on Alfonse in Dictionnaire de Biographie française, Paris, 1933, p. 1491. Guillaume Le Testu’s Grande Jave of 1556 is part of the Terre Australle, and bears a Baie Braecillie on its northwest coast, an appellation, as noted by Armand Rainaud in 1893, \\"which without doubt comes from the globes of Schoener and the maps of Oronce Fine\\".\\"qui provient sans doute des globes de Schoener et des cartes d’Oronce Finé\\", Armand Rainaud, Le Continent Austral: Hypothèses et Découvertes, Paris, Colin, 1893 (repr. Amsterdam, Meridian Pub. Co., 1965), p. 291. This appellation appears on other Dieppe maps as baie bresille on the Rotz map, Baye bresille on the Harleian, and Baye bresill on the Desceliers, indicating the reliance of their makers on the Schoener/Fine cosmography. Johannes Schoener defined Brasilia australis as \\"an immense region toward Antarcticum newly discovered but not yet fully surveyed, which extends as far as Melacha and somewhat beyond; close to this region lies the great island of Zanzibar\\".Johannes Schoener, Opusculum Geographicum, Norimberga, [1533], f.21v ; quoted in Roger Hervé, Découverte fortuite de l’Australie et de la Nouvelle- Zélande par des navigateurs pourtugais et espagnols entre 1521 et 1528, Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, 1982, p. 65, n.145. On Fine's 1531 mappemonde, BRASIELIE REGIO is shown as part of the Terra Australis lying to the east of Africa and to the south of Java, just where Schoener located BRASIELIE REGIO on his 1523 globe, and where the Dieppe maps locate their Baye Bresille. King concludes that the Dieppe cartographers identified the Regio Patalis, shown on Oronce Fine's world maps of 1531 and 1534 as a huge peninsula of the southern continent, with either Locach, as did Gerardus Mercator on his 1541 globe, or with Java Major (Jave la Grande).

He notes that Java Minor was identified with the island of Madura by Antonio Pigafetta, the diarist of Magellan's expedition. Pigafetta recorded that at Timor, the local people had explained to them, in response to their query regarding Java Minor: \\"that the lesser Java was the isle of Madura and half a league near to Greater Java\\". The mis-identification of Java Minor with the island of Madura allowed the southern coast of Java Major to remain undefined. This in turn permitted 16th century cartographers to identify Java Major as a promontory of the Terra Australis and with Polo's Region of Locach.Robert J. King, “Java on the Paris Gilt Globe, c.1524-1528”, Globe Studies, vol. 64/65, 2018, pp.64-73.

Being Jews, the Cassirer family fled the Nazis in the 1930s. As a refugee scholar, Heinz went to University of Glasgow working with Professor H. J. Paton, who persuaded him to write a book on Kant's third Critique, the Critique of Judgment. Following Paton, he moved to Oxford, lecturing at Corpus Christi College, where his students included Iris Murdoch (Weitzman: 1999). He returned to the University of Glasgow in 1946, having been appointed to a permanent lectureship, and remained there until 1960 when he withdrew to focus on newfound biblical interests. He was a noted scholar on the thought of Kant. He thought highly of Karl Barth's understanding of Kant. Cassirer, a \\"translator and interpret of Kant, is reliably reported to have asked, ‘Why is it that this Swiss theologian understands Kant far better than any philosopher I have come across?’\\" (Gunton 2002: xvi). While at Glasgow, his observations of society in Scotland led him to speak of \\"'Highland ravings' - the obsessive clinging on to what is wholly illusory\\" (Weitzman 1997: 30). As a middle-aged adult, reading the New Testament for the first time, Cassirer was struck by the writings of St. Paul in relation to ethics. As he studied, he committed himself to the Christian faith and was baptized in the Anglican Church in 1955. He produced a translation of the New Testament from the Greek sources, titled God's New Covenant: A New Testament Translation. His translation is also noted for its formal language. Below is a sample passage, Matthew 7:24-25. Cassirer's translation efforts began with a topic-based collation of Paul's letters, divided into forty categories. This work went through several iterations and a list of the category headings is printed at the end of God's New Covenant: A New Testament Translation (pp. 493–494). In the final year of his life, Cassirer also completed a translation of Sophocles' last play, Oedipus at Colonus. This work and the Categories remain unpublished. Writings by Heinz Cassirer  * 1927.

The fire lasted for almost an hour and caused several traffic jams in Fortunato F. Halili Avenue and the North Luzon Expressway.  Related incidents  Bocaue is well known in the Philippines for its fireworks production. However, because of this, the town is also susceptible to large fires every New Year. In 1988, the town was rocked by earth-shaking blasts from exploding makeshift factories that produce firecrackers and other pyrotechnic devices. Another incident in 2004 even killed 8 and affected 1000 homes. The cause of this incident is fireworks testing when a man tested a firework called higad, (\\"caterpillar\\" in English) the sparks reached a display of firecrackers. The explosions on 2007, 2004 and 1988 were among the many powerful blasts plaguing the pyrotechnics industry. These, notwithstanding the use of children in the manufacture and sale of these devices.  Government restrictions  The Philippine government has put several restrictions regarding fireworks use and several fireworks are actually banned from use. However, these restrictions are usually ignored. The sore point of these restrictions is the Republic Act 7183 which regulates the sale, manufacture, sale, distribution and use of firecrackers and other pyrotechnic devices. The only allowed firecrackers and pyrotechnics are enlisted in the law including the maximum amount of gunpowder that can be used in an individual firecracker.Philippine Laws, Statutes And Codes - Chan Robles Virtual Law Library  Location  Municipality of Bocaue in Bulacan province where the fire occurred. The fire occurred in Barangay Turo, Bocaue, Bulacan. At the site there are stores selling fireworks in which they are beside one another. Beside them is an electric substation of Meralco, few meters away is the Bocaue Exit of North Luzon Expressway and there is a gas station nearby.  Causes  The Bureau of Fire Protection believes that somebody lit a cigarette and accidentally threw it into a stack of fireworks at the back of a store. The Philippine National Police believes that it is caused by a chemical reaction. The fireworks testing theory has also been a probable cause but has been since put down. As of 2 January 2008, the cigarette theory is accepted as the cause of the fire.  Events  People run to safety when the fireworks exploded in the streets. (Courtesy of GMA Network TV Show: 24 Oras) Even before the fire, several people noticed the problems regarding the setting of the fireworks stores. They noticed that there are no gaps between the stores and some even warned the vendors the dangers in the event of a fire. Coincidentally, a day before the fire, 30 December, the same area suffered a power blackout when a fuse of a power post exploded that morning. This left several stores and houses without power. On 31 December 2007, the firemen on duty on the area was transferred, leaving everything susceptible to a major fire. The incident occurred a day before the New Year. Every year, this portion of the town becomes a market of fireworks and people from all over flock at this place. The trading is at its height when the fire occurred and many people are present. At 10:00 AM, the fire began when a Judas Belt, was ignited when a cigarette was thrown away according to the authorities. It exploded and its sparks reaches a stack of fireworks from another store. Store owners attempted to put out the fire but an explosion rippled the stores entirely. In a few minutes, in what appeared to be a small firework explosion turned into a large, uncontrollable fire. During the fire, motorists plying the North Luzon Expressway saw the smoke from the fire and even slowed down to see it. The people ran for safety to a nearby vacant lot, just behind a terminal of passenger vans servicing the route of Bocaue, Bulacan to SM City Pampanga in the City of San Fernando, Pampanga, causing a stampede. The explosion reached the street and broke some of the windows of nearby houses and establishments. Establishments across the road managed to quickly cover their glass windows and doors, thus preventing them from being shattered. In a matter of minutes the firemen arrived at the scene and before 11:00 AM the fire was put out.  Casualties  The fire injured 7 people including two crewmen of GMA Network and there are four people missing, but they were soon recovered. All of the stores have burned and the remaining fireworks are disposed. Nobody was killed. A total of three vehicles burned during the fire.  Aftermath  Several people are dismayed by what happened. They believe that lack of strict enforcement of local laws made the incident possible. They also believe that somebody should be liable for what happened since the fires and series of explosions shattered the glass windows around the area, causing injuries. Atty. Carlo Santiago, one of the witnesses,GMANews.TV - Witness recounts experience in Bocaue explosion - Video - Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs - Latest Philippine News - BETA will file a case against the store owners. The fire department was criticized, due to an absence of firemen at the time of the fire. Although swift, the firemen still arrived too late with nothing left on the stores. After the incident, the other store owners who closed their stores reopened. After several hours, the situation was back to normal. The prices of the fireworks also dropped significantly as the New Year approached although it is not attributed to the incident. The store owners also tried retrieve their properties and the authorities found out several flaws on the side of the store owners. On 2 January 2008, the Bureau of Fire Protection is considering a revoke of permits to Bocaue store owners and the investigators have drawn up a list of possible \\"suspects\\" but refused to name them while the investigation is pending.GMANews.TV - BFP may revoke permits of Bocaue stall owners - Regions - Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs - Latest Philippine News - BETA According to investigators, the store owner where the fire started will not be sued since everything happened accidentally.GMANews.TV - Bocaue firecracker store owner where fire started won't be sued - Video - Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs - Latest Philippine News - BETA Also, the investigation of the accident is stalled due to absence of witnesses.GMANews.TV - Lack of witnesses stall Bocaue blast probe - Regions - Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs - Latest Philippine News - BETA Senator Aquilino Pimentel also proposed a total ban of fireworks.

Patch Description The agency's uniform shoulder patch depicts two Maryland Militiamen, who also happened to be Baltimore County Deputy Sheriffs who were killed during the British land and sea attack at the Battle of North Point on September 12, 1814, in the War of 1812 (later celebrated as a state, county, and city holiday as \\"Defenders' Day\\" - simultaneous with the bombardment of Fort McHenry from the Patapsco River on September 13-14th, and the inspiration for the writing of the National Anthem, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" by Francis Scott Key, 1779-1843). Henry Wells and Richard McComas have historically been given credit for shooting and killing the commanding British General Robert Ross and were later both killed in the following skirmish and battle. A memorial known as the \\"Wells-McComas Monument\\" to the two fallen Militia Soldiers/Deputies is located on North Gay Street by the intersecting Aisquith and Orleans Streets in \\"Ashland Square\\" in East Baltimore City, where they were buried beneath after being exhumed in the 1870s from their original grave site and moved with great ceremony and publicity to Ashland Square. A smaller memorial where the two Deputies/Militiamen and nearby General Ross were killed is located on Old Battle Grove Road in Dundalk near \\"Battle Acre\\", the small, one-acre park donated to the State on the 25th Anniversary of Defenders' Day, in 1839 marking the center of the North Point Battlefield off Old North Point Road, its later parallel by-pass - North Point Boulevard at the intersection with German Hill Road, from September 12, 1814. Here to celebrate the extensive week-long \\"Star-Spangled Banner Centennial Anniversary\\" in 1914, the historic site was surrounded by an decorative cast-iron fence and a large stone base with a bronze cannon surmounting it and with a historical bronze plaque mounted on the side. Large stone-base signs with historical markers visible to passing traffic noting the \\"Battle of North Point\\" and \\"War of 1812\\" sites were also erected north and south of the historic battlefield area in the median strip of the 1977-era Baltimore Beltway, (Interstate 695) by the Maryland Department of Transportation's State Highway Administration that were placed through the efforts finally in 2004 of various local historical preservation-minded citizens and the Dundalk-Patapsco Neck Historical Society.

It was released on DVD on February 5, 2008. The film takes place in the fictional town of Ferntiuktuk, Alaska. It is the final installment in the series to feature Buddy himself as well as any characters from the Air Bud films. Plot Air Bud's five Golden Retriever puppies known as the Buddies from the town of Fernfield, Washington are having fun with their new owners before they go to school. The puppies meet up in the park and decide to play hide and seek. Budderball sees an ice cream truck and decides to go in, forcing the others to try and rescue him. However, the Buddies become trapped in a truck heading to Ferntiuktuk, Alaska. Upon arrival, the Buddies meet Shasta, a Siberian Husky puppy whose 11-year-old owner, Adam Bilson, is determined to win the Alaskan sled dog race because of what happened to his father. The puppies decide to help Shasta pursue his dreams as well as get to the airport, located at the finish line. Unfortunately, as Shasta's parents are both dead, this puts the puppies in a predicament as there is nobody to teach them how to become snow dogs. Fortunately, Shasta manages to persuade a legendary Alaskan Malamute named Talon, who had taught Shasta's father, into teaching the puppies into becoming his new protégés. When Shasta introduces Adam to his new sleigh team, the child is delighted at the prospect of his dreams coming true and the team pursue vigorous training routines. Adam begins building a new sleigh with his team of hard-working puppies. Talon proudly watches as the team's efforts come to fruition and it seems as though they are cooperating as a team. The older town huskies, however, are not impressed and begin to plan their downfall. They reveal to the Buddies that Shasta's parents were killed in a dog sled race last year when the ice beneath them shattered to dishearten them. They perished on that fateful day. Talon calls the puppies to the mountain lake one night to view the Northern Lights before he goes of telling Shasta that he knows all he needs to know and that he can become the great leader that his father was. The following morning, the puppies enter the race with Adam. But everyone else laughs at the thought of a boy and puppies entering a race. The sheriff goes over the rules and sees Adam wrote his own name in the entry list. After being reminded how treacherous the race is by the sheriff, the puppies begin their trek while Jean George III, an unscrupulous French musher and last year's champion, cheats his way through every race by sabotaging the other mushers' sleds or pushing them off their sleds. Soon only young Adam and Jean George are left but news of a terrible blizzard arrives and it's too late to call off the race as the racers have already gotten past the midway checkpoint. Meanwhile, the puppies' parents, Buddy and Molly follow the puppies to Alaska, after being tipped by Himalayan cat Miss Mittens, where the Saint Bernard dog Bernie informs them of their participation in the race. Sheriff Ryan gets a message sent by Fernfield's Deputy Dan asking for any information on the Buddies. The Sheriff phones Deputy Dan to inform him that the Buddies are in Alaska. A dangerous blizzard forces Adam and the team to take shelter in an igloo provided by an Inuit until the storm subsides. They come head to head with Jean George, and Adam gets injured. Adam then recovers while Francois and Philippe, the lead dogs of Jean George's team, get into trouble when the ice beneath them shatters. Jean George continues and abandons his dogs while Adam and the puppies begin a rescue operation despite Shasta's fears of his parents' death. The puppies pull Francois and Philippe out of the icy waters and Jean George continues the race without any gratitude and abandons their rescuers. Francois and Philippe realize they owe nothing to their owner for leaving them to die, and everything to Shasta and the Buddies for rescuing them, and so, decide to \\"go on strike.\\" They stop and refuse to run any further, causing Jean George to lose the race. Adam is victorious and the Buddies reunite with Buddy and Molly. Jean George scolds his dogs for embarrassing him, and they respond in kind by chasing him around the Arctic. The Buddies sadly say goodbye to their new best friend, Shasta, as well as Adam, and both groups promise that they will stay in touch with each other. All seven Buddies return home via airplane and are greeted by their owners Sam, Bartleby, Billy, Alice, Pete, Henry and Noah; who were waiting for them. Budderball and his owner, Bartleby, are watching the news the next day and Bartleby is completely dumbstruck when he watches the part about the Buddies, Adam and Shasta winning the race. That night, Buddy and Molly sit on the roof of their house and discuss their puppies' accomplishments, while wondering if there'll ever outgrow exploring. The film ends with Adam and a now nearly full-grown Shasta hiking through Alaska on a cold, winter night with five new adult huskies, while Talon narrates a reminder for the audience that \\"life may lead you where you least expect, but have faith, and you'll know exactly where you were meant to be.\\" Cast *Skyler Gisondo as B-Dawg *Jimmy Bennett as Buddha *Josh Flitter as Budderball *Henry Hodges as Mudbud *Liliana Mumy as Rosebud *Tom Everett Scott as Buddy *Molly Shannon as Molly *Kris Kristofferson as Talon, an Alaskan Malamute *James Belushi as Bernie, a St. Bernard *Paul Rae as Phillipe, Jean George's secondary lead husky *Lothaire Bluteau as Francois, Jean George's primary lead husky *Whoopi Goldberg as Miss Mittens, a Himalayan cat *Christian Pikes as Henry *John Kapelos as Jean George *Dylan Sprouse as Shasta, a Siberian Husky puppy *Richard Karn as Patrick *Dominic Scott Kay as Adam Bilson *Cynthia Stevenson as Jackie *Dylan Minnette as Noah Home video Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray on January 31, 2012.

Other features include a music video, bloopers and behind the scenes. Production An American Humane Certified Safety Representative visited the Snow Buddies set the first day of filming. Fifteen Golden Retriever puppies were on set and fifteen other were being treated by a local veterinarian, and their illnesses were eventually diagnosed as Giardia and Coccidia. On request from the representative the remaining puppies on set received additional veterinary checks. Twenty-five of the puppies were from an American breeder and five were from a Canadian breeder. It was discovered that the puppies were approximately 8 weeks old, which lead to the belief that the puppies were only 6 weeks old when they were brought by the trainer to the movie set. Per the USDA it was at the time illegal to transport puppies under the age of 8 weeks. Three of the removed puppies had to be euthanized due to intestinal complications. After the removal of all 30 puppies, 28 older Golden Retriever puppies were brought in to continue filming. All of the 28 older puppies were unfortunately exposed to parvovirus, six fell ill after exposure to the virus and an additional five died after the exposure. As a result, the movie was not permitted to use the \\"No animals were harmed...\\" disclaimer and received an Unacceptable marking from the American Humane Association.

It was produced by Associated Talking Pictures. It is also known as Call a Cop. The film features the songs, \\"I'm The Ukulele Man\\", \\"On The Beat\\", \\"I Wish I Was Back On The Farm\\" and \\"I'm Shy\\". Beryl Reid makes her film debut in an uncredited role, while Ronald Shiner appears similarly uncredited, in the role of the Piano Mover and Tuner. Working on the film as associate producer and writer, this production was an early assignment for director Basil Dearden: \\"it was relatively easy to fit the Formby films into the new demands thrown up by the war: whereas George had typically had to overcome rogues and villains in his 1930s films, these were now simply replaced by spies and saboteurs\\". The film title is a pun, using the colloquial term \\"copper\\" meaning a policeman, with the longer phrase \\"spare a copper\\" used by beggars - meaning can you spare a penny (which I might have). Synopsis Formby plays a bumbling War Reservist police officer called George Carter who aspires to become a member of the flying squad. The film is set in Merseyside where the battleship HMS Hercules is being built. A group of saboteurs are planning to blow it up. George manages to foil them. One of the saboteurs, called \\"Jake\\", is played by Bernard Lee. The saboteurs include fellow police officers who plan to shoot Formby in a remote area but he escapes in a motorised toy car. A crazy chase ensues ending in Formby going round and round a wall of death before foiling the plot.

The shells of species in the genus Physa are left-handed or sinistral. Description The shell is 7 to 12 mm high and 4 to 7 mm wide. The spiral has four to five whorls ( the last of which forms more than three- quarters of the shell height) and the apex is rounded. The shell is very thin- walled, translucent, shiny and is a pale horn colour. The aperture is wide and oval, and the mouth edge is very thin and brittle. The body color is brown to black. The edges of the mantle extend as finger-like lobes over the exterior of the shell. The tentacles are long, slender and cylindrical, with the eyes at the base. The foot is long and thin. Bladder snails are hermaphrodites. Ecology This species is an opportunist inhabiting streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, springs, canals and irrigation ditches. It occurs in both nutrient-poor and richly vegetated habitats. It may be found in (moderately) polluted water bodies. Distribution This species has a wide distribution in the western Palaearctic but confusion with similar species makes the eastern limits of its distribution uncertain. The range is probably Eurasian Boreo-temperate. Some ‘species’ found in North America may be conspecific in which case the range could be Circumpolar Boreo-temperate.

The album was released in 2008 on March 14 (Europe), April 9 (Japan), April 29 (North America). This is the first original White Lion studio album since their 1991 album Mane Attraction and is the only studio album with the new-line up which still features original lead singer Mike Tramp. The album is also a sequel to the band's 1987 album Pride. Following the release of the compilation album The Best of White Lion the band was mostly known as Tramp's White Lion or White Lion 2 due to legal reasons with former members but is now once again simply known as White Lion. Tour The band did a world tour to support the album. White Lion toured India and played to 42,000 at Shillong, Meghalaya, and a 30,000 plus crowd at the Dimapur stadium in Nagaland. The band was invited to India by the head of the Tripura Royal Family Maharaja Kirit Pradyot Deb Burman. Reception Return of the Pride received mostly lukewarm reviews from fans and critics alike. Sea of Tranquility criticized the album for deviating from the core White Lion sound commenting the album \\"has absolutely nothing in common with the real White Lion.\\" Reviewer Murat Batmaz noted that some of the songs were strong as Mike Tramp solo numbers but did not work under the White Lion moniker due to the absence of guitarist Vito Bratta. Sputnik Music gave the album a similar rating. It was defined as being \\"conventional\\" and \\"[not] horrible.\\" The review also argues that the abundance of keyboards is due to the guitarist not being up to the standards of Bratta. While the reviewer praised Tramp's vocals on some of the songs as being \\"strong\\" and \\"clear,\\" they also pointed out that songs like \\"Take Me Home\\" were like a \\"third-rate\\" version of \\"When the Children Cry.\\" Melodic Rock was more positive about the release, awarding it a 91 out of 100. The reviewer likened the songs to older White Lion albums such as Pride and Mane Attraction and considered them an \\"extension of [Tramp's songwriting].\\" Rock Eyez gave the album three stars and remarked: \\"this record is somewhat of a mixed bag to me with some truly good songs and a few misses along the way. Come to think of it, if you look back at the last couple WHITE LION releases before this (“Big Game” and “Mane Attraction”) you sort of got the same thing, so this maybe is closer to the old WHITE LION than I originally thought.\\" The Metal Forge praised the epic song \\"Sangre De Cristo\\" comparing it to White Lion's \\"Lights & Thunder\\" but also pointed out that he couldn't \\"help but feel a little misled, cheated and disappointed\\" with the album in general. Greg Prato of All Music heaped praise on guitarist Jamie Law noting it is \\"no small task\\" to fill in Vito Bratta's shoes and described the album opener \\"Sangre de Cristo\\" \\"surprisingly heavy.\\" Track listing #\\"Sangre de Cristo\\" - 8:44 #\\"Dream\\" - 5:08 #\\"Live Your Life\\" - 4:52 #\\"Set Me Free\\" - 4:59 #\\"I Will\\" - 4:13 #\\"Battle at Little Big Horn\\" - 7:32 #\\"Never Let You Go\\" - 4:50 #\\"Gonna Do It My Way\\" - 4:24 #\\"Finally See the Light\\" - 4:55 #\\"Let Me Be Me\\" - 4:00 #\\"Take Me Home\\" (European bonus track) - 3:50 =Bonus tracks= *\\"Dream\\" (Alternate version) (Japanese bonus track) *\\"Wait\\" (Live) (North American bonus track) *\\"When the Children Cry\\" (Live) (North American bonus track) Singles *\\"Dream\\" *\\"Live Your Life\\" Band members *Mike Tramp - vocals *Jamie Law - guitars *Claus Langeskov - Bass *Troy Patrick Farrell - drums *Henning Wanner - keyboards  References  External links *Official White Lion Website *Official Mike Tramp Website *Official Troy Patrick Farrell Website Category:White Lion albums Category:2008 albums Category:Frontiers Records albums ","title":"Return of the Pride"},{"id":"14992965","text":"KZWY (94.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a classic rock format. Licensed to Sheridan, Wyoming, United States. the station is currently owned by Lovcom, Inc. All Lovcom stations are located in the Sheridan Media Radio Center, at 1716 KROE Lane on Sheridan's east side. History The station went on the air as KROE-FM on December 5, 1977, becoming Sheridan, Wyoming's first FM radio station. KROE-FM's 20,000 Watt transmitter was located in the new KROE building and the signal was broadcast to the Sheridan area from an antenna mounted on the KROE tower. Through most of the 1980s and the early to mid 1990s, KROE-FM aired various satellite-delivered Adult Contemporary music formats. Responding to local demand, the format was shifted to a more rock- oriented lineup toward the later part of that decade. On June 30, 1997, the station changed its call sign to KZWY. Along with the call letter change, the music format was solidified with a locally programmed rock format and a new slogan: \\"Rock and Roll from Yesterday and Today.\\" Also in the late 1990s, the station was moved to a new transmitter site at the top of the Big Horn Mountains and the power was increased to 75,000 Watts. This allowed the station to cover a large portion of Northeast Wyoming, including most of Sheridan, Johnson and Campbell counties. In 2003, the slogan was modified to \\"Wyoming's Best Rock,\\" while the format continued to be a mix of classic and new rock. Most of the programming on KZWY remained locally generated, but some nationally syndicated weekend shows were added including The Beatle Years, Flashback, The House of Hair, The Tour Bus and Harddrive. In 2012, Lovcom, Inc. signed on KOWY at 102.3 FM, and the Adult contemporary format which had been airing on KLQQ-HD2 (and translated on K240DW at 95.9 FM) was moved to this new station. \\"Magic 95.9\\" became \\"Magic 102.3.\\" Meanwhile, the hybrid rock library on KZWY was split into two distinct formats. At the end of May 2012, KZWY began airing a straight classic rock format with an accompanying slogan change to \\"Wyoming's Classic Rock,\\" while the new rock was moved to the newly available KLQQ-HD2 (and corresponding translator), which was relaunched as an Active Rock station branded \\"95.9 The Edge.\\" KZWY began broadcasting in HD Radio in the fall of 2005. Initially, a heavier rock format called \\"Nitro\\" was aired on the HD-2 channel and ESPN Radio on HD-3. Various HD multicast format changes occurred over the next few years, eventually settling on a Waitt Radio Networks Oldies format on HD-2 and eliminating the HD-3 channel. The Oldies channel is called \\"Oldies 105.9\\" because it is rebroadcast on two analog translators (K290BL and K290BM), both at 105.9 FM. In 2013, failures in the HD equipment on KLQQ forced a move of the Active Rock format from KLQQ-HD2 to KZWY-HD3. This channel is rebroadcast on translator K240DW as \\"95.9 The Edge.\\" As of 2014, KZWY is the only station in the Lovcom group broadcasting in HD Radio. In February 2017, KZWY added an HD-4 channel carrying a non- political talk format - also rebroadcast on a translator (K292DZ) - branded as \\"Smart Talk 106.3\\" Translators K240DW rebroadcasts KZWY's HD-3 programming, branded as \\"95.9 The Edge\\". K290BL and K290BM both rebroadcast KZWY's HD-2 programming, which is branded as \\"Oldies 105.9\\" to reflect the dial position of the translators on which it appears.

Situated on the borders of the railroad, it shelters the headquarters of Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel and also Unidos de Padre Miguel, as well as many of their components. Its principal road is called Rua Belisário de Souza, that goes from the ensemble of IAPI, in Padre Miguel, until Realengo.  History  The area where, nowadays, Vila Vintém is located, once belonged to the Army. The first residents needed to ask permission from the militants to build their houses, that were, almost always, of stucco and sapê (General name for diverse grassy plants, normally used on the covering of cabins or on rustic houses). There were nor sewers neither lights - instead they used drains, candles, and torches. The stoves were made of firewood and there were only some “collective water pipes”, where residents would get water with tins. In 1939 the railway station of Moça Bonita was built, where before stood only a little stop of the train at the railway. The workers of the railway station began to populate Vila Vintém. The workers that built the apartments situated in Marechal Falcão da Frota Street also came to live in the community, that grew each time more. There was little commerce, only some grocery stores and a coal-pit; the light came until the residents' association where it was distributed to the whole community. The basic sanitation (piped water and sewerage system) came in the government of Carlos Lacerda. In the 1950s, the railroad station of Moça Bonita became called \\"Padre Miguel\\" (that later became the name of the neighborhood), to homage the priest Miguel de Santa Maria Mochon, that dedicated all his life to the church Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Conceição de Realengo. All the region of Moça Bonita became known as “Padre Miguel”.  Localization and access The community of Vila Vintém is located between 2 neighborhoods: Realengo (where it starts in Barão do Triunfo street) and Padre Miguel (ends in General Gomes de Castro street). You can get to the community through Avenida Brasil (dismounting Estrada da Água Branca, Barão do Triunfo street, and Lomas Valentina street in Realengo; and Jacques Ouriques street, Gal. José Faustino, General Gomes de Castro in Padre Miguel). Arriving from Avenida Santa Cruz (other side of the railway track), you cross the viaduct of Realengo or Padre Miguel dismounting also the streets of Barão do Triunfo or Gal. Gomes de Castro, where you arrive at the streets Belizário de Souza and/or Mesquita, the principal streets of Vila Vintém. Drug trafficking Vila Vintém is also known as a place where there is much drug trafficking, for it is one of the favelas controlled by the criminal faction Amigos dos Amigos. There is the residence of the drug trafficker Celso Luís Rodrigues, mostly known as Celsinho of Vila Vintém, imprisoned in 2002.

Khandallah railway station is one of eight stations on the Johnsonville Line, a commuter branch railway north of Wellington in New Zealand’s North Island. The station was erected and operated by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR) on their line from Wellington to Longburn. From the acquisition of the WMR by the New Zealand Railways Department in 1908 until the opening of the Tawa Flat deviation in 1937, the station was on the North Island Main Trunk Railway. Electric multiple unit trains are operated under the Metlink brand through this station in both directions to Johnsonville (to the north) and Wellington (to the south).  History  Khandallah was one of three stations constructed by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company on what is now known as the Johnsonville Branch. It was opened on 21 September 1885 along with the first section of the company’s line between Wellington and Paremata. Timetabled services began several days later on the 24th. As originally constructed by the WMR, the \\"flag\\" station had a single side platform, a small wooden passenger shelter, and a crossing loop. Later, after the government assumed control of the line, the station had a signal box built at the north end of the platform, a second loop and a back shunt. By 1947, there was only one loop and the second platform had been installed with its own passenger shelter. The back shunt and signal box were removed more recently, possibly when the WMR station building was replaced in 1967. In January 2019 a SUV was accidentally driven onto the station tracks.  Operation  Up trains use the loop at this station, with Down trains remaining on the main line. Safety sidings are located at the northern and southern ends of the loop for Up and Down trains (respectively). Colour light signals are also located at both ends of the platforms.  Services  Station car park. Trains run in both directions through this station, departing at half-hourly intervals, supplemented by a 13/13/26 schedule at peak times on week days.  Facilities  This station has dual side platforms with a passenger shelter on each. There is a small station car park (9 parks) off Station Road, behind the Up train platform. The original station and signalbox buildings were on the Down platform. Pedestrian access to the station is from the north ends of the Up and Down platforms to Station Road, which is also gives access between the platforms via a level crossing with automatic half-arm barriers. There is also pedestrian access from the south end of the Down platform via a zig-zag path to the junction of Cashmere Avenue and Agra Crescent. There is a pedestrian path from the north side of the crossing to the bottom of the Burma Road hill and a pedestrian rail crossing with bells between Burma Road and Poona Street.

History The Forest of Dean was an extra- parochial area in the St Briavels Hundred of Gloucestershire. It was without the usual parish structure until the West Dean and East Dean townships were formed in 1844. For poor relief, West Dean was grouped into the Monmouth Poor Law Union and was included in the Monmouth rural sanitary district. Following the Local Government Act 1894, West Dean became a civil parish in the West Dean Rural District. In 1974 the rural district was abolished and West Dean became one of 41 civil parishes in the Forest of Dean district.List of Forest of Dean Parish Councils Governance West Dean parish is divided electorally into 5 wards with a total of 15 councillors as follows: * Ellwood and Sling Ward - 2 councillors * Christchurch Ward - 1 councillor * Bream Ward - 5 councillors * Pillowell Ward - 5 councillors * Berry Hill Ward - 2 councillors. The council is consulted by all public service providers and has a statutory right to comment on all planning applications in West Dean. In 2000 it purchased and refurbished Bream Community Centre, which has since been extended and a Parish Office established there. Other areas Council have become involved in are provision of bus shelters, street cleaning, footpaths, play areas, environmental improvements and capital projects such as the restoration of Bream Cenotaph and works at Parkend Churchyard. The Council meets on the last Wednesday of each month at Beam Community Centre at 7pm. Every Council meeting begins with a Public Open Forum to enable electors to ask questions or comment on matters that affect the Parish. Geography West Dean is the largest civil parish in the Forest of Dean district, both in respect of its population and its geographical size. At the 2001 census there were 10,305 people living in West Dean Parish, more than in any of the Forest towns.

Indicates birthplace and age 53. Indicates age 40. His career included host duties at various radio stations in Canada and the United States. His most prominent work was with Q107 in Toronto, where he became morning host in 1980. After broadcasting in other cities, he returned to Q107 in the early 1990s to join \\"The Q Morning Zoo\\". In 1980, after Terry Fox was forced to abandon his Marathon of Hope, Connors responded by raising CAD$72,000 for cancer research by continuously hosting a 36-hour \\"Scruff-a-thon\\" on Q107. Radio stunts At one point while working at Q107 in 1982, Connors confined himself to the station's on-air studio and repeatedly aired the Led Zeppelin song \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". By July 1982, Connors completed 107 trips in seven hours on the Mighty Canadian Minebuster roller coaster at Canada's Wonderland establishing a record during the theme park's initial years. Connors conducted a contest in 1989 as an announcer at CHTZ-FM in St. Catharines, Ontario, claiming that the Mayflower would be stationed at a nearby port so that 40 winners would be eligible to have a Thanksgiving meal there. However, what actually appeared was a moving truck from Mayflower Transit. While still at CHTZ-FM, the disc jockey announced during a 21 March 1990 broadcast that \\"new kids\\" would appear at the station the following day. The music group New Kids on the Block were scheduled to play in nearby Hamilton later that week. Although that band's music was not aired on the rock-oriented CHTZ-FM, hundreds of fans of the boy band appeared at the station, expecting to see their idols. Instead, they were greeted with limousines arriving at the station containing several mothers and their newborn infants (or \\"new kids\\"). Some of the upset crowd tried to enter the station building, requiring the station to secure the facilities. In January 1995, while working in Winnipeg, Connors was given a week's suspension by CJKR-FM management after he announced a contest where selected listeners could watch Super Bowl XXIX in Miami. 1200 listeners submitted their entries by fax of whom 30 were chosen to meet Connors at Winnipeg International Airport. However, the winners boarded a bus at the airport rather than a plane, and their destination was Miami, Manitoba to watch the game on a monochrome television at Chatterbox Lounge. Connors reacted to the controversy stating \\"How was I supposed to know Miami was in Florida?\\" Controversy In mid-1982, CHUM-FM avoided direct mention of Toronto club venue Scuffers during its entertainment announcements due to its naming resemblance to Scruff Connors at rival station Q107. Scuffers' owners suspended advertising at CHUM- FM because the radio station referred to their club by its address or as \\"The Cave\\". When Connors was working for The Bear (CFBR-FM) in Edmonton in 1992, he was charged with sexual assault in a case that purportedly occurred at a hotel in October 1992. He was acquitted of these charges in January 1993, although Connors reconsidered his broadcasting career due to the stress of this case. The broadcaster sustained a reported nervous breakdown in October 1995, which he blamed on job stress and uncertainty. During a broadcast at Toronto's MOJO Radio on 16 November 2001, Connors and co-host John Derringer joked about obtaining a job at a multicultural radio station. The duo called Fairchild Radio only to receive a voice mail message, at which point Connors proceeded to speak around the recording with a phony Chinese accent. The Executive Director of the Chinese Canadian National Council complained to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) charging that the broadcast was racist. The CBSC ruled that this incident did not breach the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Code of Ethics regarding \\"abusive or discriminatory\\" material, although the dialogue could be considered in questionable taste. Declining health Connors incurred injuries to his two rotator cuffs, limiting his arm movements. His last on-air job, at MOJO radio, was terminated in July 2005 when the station changed its format. Within a few months, Connors experienced a pair of heart attacks which required quadruple heart bypass surgery. Later in 2005, doctors discovered that Connors had contracted bladder cancer. In late January 2008, during an interview with fellow radio broadcaster Fred Patterson, Connors indicated that he was in good health following various operations. He stated that he was recuperating in Osoyoos, British Columbia. In August 2008, a poster to a Canadian radio discussion board posted a rumour that Connors had died the previous evening, but Connors later clarified in an interview with the Toronto Sun that he was still alive and had recently won over $100,000 in a Lotto 6/49 draw. On 18 December 2016, Newfield unexpectedly died. Career Connors' work included the following radio stations: * 1980 - 1985: Q107, Toronto * late 1980s: WYSP, Philadelphia * 1989-1992: CHTZ-FM, St. Catharines, Ontario * August - October 1992: CFBR-FM, Edmonton * January 1993 - July 1994: Q107, Toronto * July 1994 - 1995: CJKR-FM Winnipeg * 2001-July 2005: CFMJ (MOJO), Toronto References Category:1952 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Canadian radio hosts Category:People from Toronto ","title":"Scruff Connors"},{"id":"14993184","text":"KLXF (90.5 FM) is a non-commercial educational radio station licensed to serve Modesto, California.

It is located in the Karpoš Municipality of Skopje, North Macedonia. It is named after the former president, Boris Trajkovski, who died in a plane crash in 2004. It has a maximum seating capacity of 7,000 for handball, 7,500 for basketball and 10,000 for concerts. The arena is home to the North Macedonia national basketball team (men and women), North Macedonia national handball team (men and women) and North Macedonia national volleyball team (men and women). The venue also contains four restaurants and a sports bar. It was one of two venues used for the 2008 European Women's Handball Championship. History Construction began in June 2004 with the city of Skopje as the main investor. It was introduced as one of the capital projects of former mayor Risto Penov. The initial term set by the city authorities for the completion was one year, but it was repeatedly set back by problems during construction. At the beginning, while digging the foundation, underground water broke and the whole site was flooded. This brought additional costs of around one million euros, on several occasions the city coffers remained low, which at times led to stoppage of the resumption of the construction work. Upon arrival by Trifun Kostovski as mayor, the city began negotiations with the government to hand over the facility in their jurisdiction. Negotiations were conducted with the previous government but had ended unsuccessfully. In February 2007, the government signed an agreement for the handover. A joint stock company \\"Boris Trajkovski\\" was established to manage the facility, with each investor receiving an appropriate number of shares by the money they invested for the final construction. The Harlem Globetrotters, were first to perform at the arena following the opening ceremony on 22 May 2008. In 2011, a hockey rink and karting track were opened. The government had funded most of the investment, which was worth 430,000 euros.

Description The shells of Discus rotundatus in the adult stage measure in diameter and in height.AnimalBase Shells are reddish brown with darker cross bands, flat and densely ribbed. The umbilicus is quite wide, reaching about 1/3 of the shell diameter. Among the species of Discus in Europe and North America, Discus rotundatus is recognized by the alternating pattern of reddish brown spots, tight coiling of the whorls and broad and shallow umbilicus. The body of this gastropod is bluish black on the upperside, while the lower side is greyish white. They mainly feed on plant debris, humus, algae and fungi. Cycle of life Shell of Discus rotundatus These snails, like most terrestrial gastropods, are hermaphrodite. The reproductive season last from May to October. Usually they lay 20-50 eggs in rotting wood or below decaying leaves. Eggs are white and flattened, measure about 1 mm and hatch after 10–30 days. These gastropods reach their maturity only in the second or third season and can live 2–3 years. Unlike many terrestrial snails they do not have a sex dart. Distribution This species lives in Western and Central Europe. It is found in the Czech Republic, Poland, UkraineBalashov I. & Gural-Sverlova N. 2012.

It is also found in Great Britain, Ireland, France, Italy, southern Scandinavia, and other countries.Fauna Europae Its range includes Turkey.Örstan, A. 2003. The first record of Discus rotundatus from Turkey. Triton, No. 7, p. 27. The species has been introduced to North America where it was first found in 1937 and now is known from six Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador) and 16 states, as well as the District of Columbia, in the United States. It does not appear to have the capability to become an invasive pest species in North America, as it lives in leaf litter and forms colonies where the individuals do not tend to spread widely. Habitat These gastropods live in forests and humid shady places, in dead wood logs, under stones, on humus and in soil litter, sometimes in colonies, at an elevation of above sea level. They can live both in natural habitats and in environments modified by humans, like gardens.Wiese, V. 2014. Die Landschnecken Deutschlands: Finden - Erkennen - Bestimmen. Quelle & Meyer: Wiebelsheim.

For more modern territorial division of Kraków region, see Kraków Voivodeship. Seniorate Province, also known as the Senioral Province (), Duchy of Kraków (Księstwo krakowskie), Duchy of Cracow, Principality of Cracow, Principality of Kraków, was the superior among the five provinces established in 1138 according to the Testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth. It existed during the period of fragmentation of Poland until 1320, centered at Kraków in Lesser Poland. The Seniorate Province was supposed to be ruled by the rotating head of the royal Piast dynasty, a principality that he held as overlord (Senior Prince or High duke, princeps) of the other Polish dukes. Senioral principle thumb300pxFragmentation of Poland in 1138: The senioral principle established in the testament stated that at all times the eldest member of the dynasty was to have supreme power over the rest (Dux, the Dukes) and was also to control an indivisible \\"Seniorate Province\\". In 1138 Bolesław's III eldest son Władysław II, took up the rule over a vast strip of land running north–south down the middle of Poland, composed of: *Lesser Poland, except for the eastern Duchy of Sandomierz allocated to Bolesław's III minor son Henry; *eastern parts of Greater Poland around Gniezno, the Polish ecclesiastical center, and Kalisz; *western Kuyavia; *the lands of Łęczyca, held by Bolesław's III widow Salomea of Berg for life. The High Duke resided at Kraków, Poland's capital since 1038. The Senior's prerogatives also included control over the Duchy of Silesia and his Pomerelian vassals at Gdańsk in eastern Pomerania. The Senior was tasked with defense of borders, the right to have troops in provinces of other Dukes, carrying out the foreign policy, supervision over the clergy (including the right to nominate bishops and archbishops), and minting the currency. The High duke generally had his own principality (province, dukedom), which he had inherited within his own branch of the Piast dynasty, and left to his personal heirs within his own branch, whereas Kraków followed the seniorate (fell to the oldest of them). Kraków was a substantial addition to the resources of the incumbent, whoever it was, and was intended to put him higher in might than his vassal dukes. However the seniorate soon collapsed, with the first Senior - Władysław II the Exile - failing his bid to take over other provinces and in 1146 was expelled by his younger half-brothers, an incident which led to long-time Polish particularism. The Duchy The duchy neighboured originally each of the four partition duchies of Masovia at Płock, Sandomierz, Silesia at Wrocław and Greater Poland at Poznań. Even after many of those were further partitioned, it bordered on several principalities, and was at least close to all. Upon the exile of High Duke Władysław II the rule was assumed by Władysław's II eldest brother Bolesław IV the Curly, Duke of Masovia, who died without issue in 1173. He was followed in the Seniorate by the second eldest Mieszko III the Old, while Masovia and the Kuyavian lands passed to Bolesław's IV minor son Leszek. The senioral principle finally turned out to be a failure as Mieszko's III rule at Kraków was not only challenged by the sons of expelled Władysław II, but also by the youngest son Casimir II the Just, who had not received any share by his late father's testament. Though upon the death of Bolesław IV the Curly he had received the Duchy of Sandomierz, in 1177 he took the occasion of an uprising by Lesser Polish nobles (magnates) and assumed the rule as High Duke from his elder brother Mieszko III. A long-term struggle between the brothers followed, whereby Mieszko III was able to incorporate the northwestern lands of Gniezno and Kalisz into his Duchy of Greater Poland. The Seniorate remained contested after Kraków was inherited by Casimir's II son Leszek I the White in 1194, still by his uncle Mieszko III (d. 1202), then by his younger brother Konrad of Masovia, by his cousin, Mieszko's III son Władysław III Spindleshanks and also by the second son of Władysław II the Exile, Duke Mieszko IV Tanglefoot of Upper Silesia. In the long-term struggle Leszek I was killed in 1227 and the Pomerelian lands got lost, when Duke Swietopelk II of Gdańsk declared himself independent. In 1232 the Silesian duke Henry I the Bearded finally prevailed, re-uniting the thrones of Wrocław and Kraków under his rule as determined by the will of late Duke Bolesław III Krzywousty in 1138. However, a re-establishment of the Polish kingdom under the rule of the Silesian Piasts failed, when Duke Henry's I son Henry II the Pious was killed during the Mongol invasion at the 1241 Battle of Legnica. After an interregnum he was succeeded by Leszek's I son Bolesław V the Chaste, who upon his death in 1279 appointed Konrad's grandson Leszek II the Black of Kuyavia. The Silesian Piasts once again reached for the Senioral Province, when Leszek II died without heirs in 1288, and Duke Henry IV Probus of Wrocław became High Duke at Kraków but likewise had no issue upon his death in 1290. The Seniorate was again contested between the dukes Przemysł II of Greater Poland and Władysław I the Elbow-high of Kuyavia. Przemysł II brought the royal Přemyslid dynasty of Bohemia into the Polish affairs, when he allied with King Wenceslaus II, whom he ceded the throne at Kraków. In 1295 however, he switched sides and had himself crowned as King of Poland (the first since the deposition of Bolesław II the Bold in 1079) at Greater Polish Gniezno. As he was killed the next year, Władysław I proclaimed himself his successor, he nevertheless had to deal with the permanent pressure by the claimants of the Bohemian Přemyslid and Luxembourg dynasties, who had begun to vassalize the southwestern Silesian duchies. In 1320 Władysław I, against the fierce resistance of King John of Bohemia, reached the consent by Pope John XXII to have himself crowned Polish king at Kraków. The Duchy of Kraków was finally incorporated into the Lands of the Polish Crown as Kraków Voivodeship. Władysław's I successor King Casimir III the Great had to buy off the Bohemian claims by renouncing Silesia in the 1335 Treaty of Trentschin. Dukes of Kraków In this list, titular claims are not noted, not as full rule; only true and real ducal power over Kraków is noted. In 1138 Bolesław III Krzywousty, Duke of all Poland at Kraków, divided his realm into five duchies, with the Seniorate Province allocated to: * 1138-46 Władysław II the Exile, also Duke of Silesia, deposed by his younger half-brothers and exiled * 1146 (possibly already earlier in power in Cracow) - 1173 Bolesław IV the Curly, half-brother, also Duke of Masovia and Duke of Silesia until 1163 (return of Władysław's II sons) * 1173-77 Mieszko III the Old, brother, Duke of Greater Poland, deposed * 1177-(90/90-)94 Casimir II the Just, also Duke of Sandomierz since 1173  1190 briefly Mieszko III again * 1194-99 Leszek I the White, son of Casimir II, Duke of Sandomierz, deposed * 1199-1202 Mieszko III, again * 1201 Leszek I of Sandomierz, again, deposed * 1202 Konrad, brother, Duke of Masovia, deposed * 1202-06 Władysław III Spindleshanks, son of Mieszko III, Duke of Greater Poland, deposed  1202- Leszek I of Sandomierz, in strife against Wladyslaw III * 1206-27 Leszek I of Sandomierz, again  1210-11 Mieszko IV Tanglefoot, Duke of Upper Silesia * 1227-29 Wladyslaw III of Greater Poland, again, deposed * 1227-28 Konrad of Masovia, again, deposed (strife against Wladyslaw III) * 1228-38 Henry I the Bearded, Duke of Lower Silesia (strife)  1229-32 Konrad of Masovia, in strife * 1238-41 Henry II the Pious, Duke of Lower Silesia * 1241 Bolesław II the Bald, Duke of Lower Silesia, driven away 1241  Mongol invasion (Konrad of Masovia was again overlord, though hardly held Cracow) * 1243-79 Bolesław V the Chaste, Duke of Sandomierz * 1279-88 Leszek II the Black, Duke of Kuyavia * 1288-90 Henry IV Probus, Duke of Wrocław (in Lower Silesia) * 1290-91 Przemysł II, Duke of Greater Poland, crowned king 1295  1291-1305 King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia  1305 King Wenceslaus III of Bohemia, deposed * 1305- Władysław I the Elbow- high, Duke of Kujavia, crowned king 1320 See also *Lesser Poland (Małopolska) Category:12th-century establishments in Poland Category:14th- century disestablishments in Poland Kraków Category:History of Poland during the Piast dynasty Category:History of Lesser Poland Category:States and territories established in 1138 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1320 ","title":"Seniorate Province"},{"id":"14993244","text":"WAYR may refer to: * WAYR (AM), a radio station (550 AM) licensed to Fleming Island, Florida, United States * WAYR-FM, a radio station (90.7 FM) licensed to Brunswick, Georgia, United States ","title":"WAYR"},{"id":"14993247","text":"WAYR-FM (90.7 MHz) is a non-profit radio station licensed to Brunswick, Georgia, USA, and serving the Georgia coast and northern suburbs of Jacksonville, Florida.

The monastic complex is famous for the diversity of its architecture which include Roman remains and significant pre-Romanesque, Romanesque and Renaissance buildings. In 2011, it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of a group of seven inscribed as Longobards in Italy, Places of Power (568-774 A.D.). The monastery is traditionally considered the place where Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne and daughter of the Lombard King Desiderius, spent her exile after the annulment of her marriage in 771. History San Salvatore was founded in 753 by Desiderius, future king of the Lombards, and his wife Ansa, as a female monastery, his daughter Anselperga becoming the first abbess. After the Lombard defeat by Charlemagne, San Salvatore maintained its privileges as a royal institution, and enlarged its possessions. Alfred the Great visited this monastery when he went to Rome in the 850s. He later founded his own monastery for nuns at Shaftesbury Abbey in Dorset, putting his own daughter in charge; although there is no clear evidence, it is possible he took this monastery as his inspiration.Studies in the Early History of Shaftesbury Abbey. Dorset County Council, 1999 In the 12th century most of the edifices were rebuilt or restored in the Romanesque style, and the oratory of Santa Maria in Solario was erected. In the 15th century all the structures were again restored and a dormitory was added. In 1599 the church of Santa Giulia was finished. The monastery was suppressed in 1798 after the French invasion of Lombardy, and turned into barracks. It remained in poor condition until 1882, when it became a Museum of the Christian Age; the decay was however not totally halted before 1966, with a general restoration and the creation of a new Museum of Santa Giulia. Overview Interior of San Salvatore's church The monastery complex includes: *The Basilica of San Salvatore, dating from around the 9th century. It has a nave and two apses, and is located over a pre-existing church, which had a single nave and three apses, and in turn was built over a Roman edifice dating from the 1st century BC, destroyed in the 5th century AD. The bell tower, rebuilt in the 13th-14th century, has frescoes by Romanino. The interior of the basilica houses frescoes by Paolo da Cailina the Younger, as well as other from the Carolingian age. The presbytery (converted in the 16th century) is a former nun choir built in 1466. Interior and frescoes Santa Maria in Solario. *The Oratory of Santa Maria in Solario, added in the 12th century. It has a square plan with an octagonal lantern and small arched loggia. The second floor is decorated with scenes of the life of Jesus. *The 16th century church of Santa Giulia. *The museum, including ancient finds dating from the Bronze Age to Roman times. Among them is the 4th century ivory Brescia Casket and a \\"Winged Victory\\" statue. There is also a plan probably showing the appearance of the Roman centre of Brixia at the time of Emperor Vespasian. The medieval section of the museum houses a crucifix alleged to have belonged to Desiderius. There are also architectural remnants from local buildings now destroyed, such as frescoes from the city's Broletto, a statue of St. Faustine and a fresco cycle by Moretto da Brescia. Also visible in the complex are some Roman houses (domus), excavated beneath the former nuns' orchard.

It is commonly used for wines from Franconia in Germany, but is also used for some Portuguese wines, in particular rosés, where the bottle is called cantil, and in rare cases for Italian wine (in this case called pulcianella) and Greek wine.  History  A Silvaner from Franconia packaged in the traditional Bocksbeutel. This bottle shape is derived from that of field bottles, which were known already in antiquity, and which were manufactured with a flattened shape for practical purposes, for example to keep the bottle from rolling away on uneven ground. The Bocksbeutel has been used for wine from Franconia at least since the early 18th century, initially for the wines from the region's most famous vineyard, the Würzburger Stein, and later for other Franconian wines, in particular those of better quality. The city council of Würzburg decided in 1728 that the best wines from the city's own winery, the Bürgerspital, should be filled in Bocksbeutel bottles.  Origin of the name  There are two conflicting claims of the origin of the name Bocksbeutel, although the Beutel-part stands for \\"container\\" in both cases. One claim is that it is derived from the Low German term Booksbüdel, which stands for a small sack used to protect and carry books, in particular prayer books or song books carried on travels (see girdle books). These sacks were used already in pre-Reformation times, but became eventually outdated and were seen as a whimsical expression of overly conservative behavior. Another claim is that the term actually means \\"ram's scrotum\\", which is supposed to be of similar shape as the bottle. This explanation is given as early as 1690 in a dictionary by Kaspar von Stieler. The term Bokesbudel with this meaning is said to have existed in the Early Middle Age, before song books were used. However, the explanations are not mutually exclusive. Franconia is well distant from the Low German-speaking lands, and a term like Booksbüdel would not normally have been understood there. If the Low German term was adopted in Franconia, any similar local words are likely to have influenced this process. There is a later expression einen Bocksbeutel anhängen (\\"to attach a Bocksbeutel [to someone]\\"), meaning \\"to make someone an object of ridicule\\", attested in the 19th-century Deutsches Wörterbuch. A physical Bocksbeutel was indeed used as a practical joke (cf. the \\"Kick me\\" prank, cuckold horns and other forms of public humiliation such as \\"donkey ears\\"), but a wine bottle is an unlikely object to use for such a purpose. Both a Booksbüdel and a ram's scrotum are perfectly suitable, being small and light objects with a connotation of ridiculousness. Thus, it is hard to determine to what extent either Booksbüdel or Bokesbudel or both contributed to the modern term.  Protected bottle shape  A wine from Franconia in a Bocksbeutel Within the European Union, the Bocksbeutel enjoys the status of a protected bottle shape.Council Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 of 29 April 2002 laying down certain rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as regards the description, designation, presentation and protection of certain wine sector products, Annex I: Reservation of certain types of bottle The regulations describe the Bocksbeutel as a short-necked glass bottle, pot-bellied but flattened in shape, with the base and the cross-section of the bottle at the point of greatest convexity ellipsoidal in shape. The ratio between the long and short axes of the ellipsoidal cross-section is approximately 2:1, and the ratio of the height of the convex body to the cylindrical neck of the bottle is approximately 2.5:1. The Bocksbeutel may be used for the following wines: * German wines of QbA and Prädikatswein quality from:  Franconia  Certain parts of Baden, in the district known as Tauber Franconia (Tauberfranken) and around Baden-Baden * Certain wines from Northern and Central Italy at the DOC and DOCG level:  Santa Maddalena (St. Magdalener),  Valle Isarco (Eisacktaler), if made from Silvaner or Müller-Thurgau  Terlaner, if made from Pinot blanc  Bozner Leiten  Alto Adige (Südtiroler), if made from Riesling, Müller-Thurgau, Pinot noir, Moscato giallo, Silvaner, Lagrein, Pinot blanc or Moscato rosa  Greco di Bianco  Trentino, if made from Moscato  (in ancient times) Montepulciano * Certain Greek wines  Agioritiko  Rombola Kephalonias  Wines from the island of Kefalonia  Wines from the island of Paros  Wines from the Peloponnese * Certain Portuguese wines, such as Mateus. The use is limited to rosé wines and those other quality wines and vinho regional which can prove that they have traditionally been bottled in cantil-type bottles before they received their present classification.

He formerly played professionally for Cesena as a midfielder. Playing career A former midfielder, Ballardini spent seven years as a player with Cesena, under youth team coach Arrigo Sacchi and first team coach Osvaldo Bagnoli, which are often cited by him as his personal mentors. Coaching career Ballardini started his coaching career serving as youth team coach for Bologna, and successively Cesena and A.C. Milan. He then worked as Parma under-19 youth team coach from 2002 to 2004. He was then appointed by Sambenedettese as new head coach for the 2004–05 season, ended with an impressive fourth place and the consequent participation in the promotion playoffs, then lost to Napoli in the semi-final. He was subsequently chosen by Massimo Cellino as new Cagliari boss for their 2005–06 Serie A campaign, being however sacked only a few weeks later, on 11 November, and replaced by Nedo Sonetti. Ballardini started the 2006–07 season at the helm of Serie B side Pescara, where he however lasted only until October, following a very unimpressive beginning in the league. He was surprisingly announced as new boss of last-placed Serie A team Cagliari on 27 December 2007, succeeding Sonetti, who ironically replaced him during his first period at the helm of the Sardinian side. Under his tenure as head coach, Cagliari dramatically improved their results, winning 32 points in 21 weeks, thus rising up the table and managing to escape relegation in advance of a week. However, Ballardini failed to find an agreement with Cagliari chairman Massimo Cellino for a contract extension, and they ultimately decided to part company on 28 May. On 4 September 2008 Palermo announced to have dismissed head coach Stefano Colantuono, appointing Ballardini as new rosanero boss in a one-year contract. In his debut match with Palermo, Ballardini led the Sicilians to a very impressive 3–1 home win to A.S. Roma, and then went on to impose the first seasonal loss to Juventus, winning 2–1 in Turin, this being the first time Palermo won at Juventus' home in 47 years. His ability to recover Palermo, leading them to the top league positions, was quickly praised once again by the media. On 7 October, just two days after the rosanero triumph in Turin, Palermo announced to have agreed a two-year contract extension with Ballardini. After weeks of rumours regarding a possible departure of Ballardini from Palermo at the end of the season, on 30 May the rosanero head coach announced he had agreed for a 10-day period to give a definite answer to the club regarding his intentions. Later that day, Palermo chairman Maurizio Zamparini announced Ballardini had asked to be relieved from his position due to his unwillingness to keep on serving as Palermo head coach. A few days later, on 5 June, Palermo unveiled Walter Zenga as new head coach, thus ending speculation regarding Ballardini's future with the rosanero. Despite being dismissed as head coach following these events, Ballardini was however still under a contract for two more years with the Sicilian club. Finally, after long rumours connecting Ballardini's name as the next coach of Lazio following Delio Rossi's departure, he was appointed as the new manager of the Roman club on 15 June 2009. He signed a two-year contract with an option for a third worth €750,000 per year. On his first competitive match as Lazio boss, Ballardini led the club to triumph in the 2009 Supercoppa Italiana, as his side won 2–1 to outgoing Italian champions Inter in a single-legged game played at Beijing National Stadium, Beijing, China. However, Ballardini did not repeat this triumph in Serie A level, and also failed to qualify to the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League knockout round. Later in January and February a number of disappointing results left Lazio in 18th place, in danger of being relegated, leading club chairman Claudio Lotito to dismiss Ballardini and appoint Edy Reja as new head coach. On 8 November 2010 Ballardini returned into management, accepting an offer as head coach of Serie A club Genoa. He signed a two-year contract with the club, but club president Enrico Preziosi terminated the contract with him for no particular reason on 5 June 2011. On 9 November 2011, Ballardini returned to manage Cagliari for the third time in his career. He was dismissed for just cause on 11 March 2012. On 21 January 2013, Ballardini returned to Genoa to try and save them from relegation. He has managed to do so with still one game to go. Nevertheless, chairman Preziosi may decide yet again to let him go at the end of the season. Ballardini is loved by many Genoa supporters for his manners and his energy on the pitch. Many want him to lead Genoa next season too. On 8 January 2014, Serie A club Bologna announced that Ballardini agreed a 6-month deal to coach their first team. On 10 November 2015, he became the manager of Palermo.Palermo: Iachini out, Ballardini in He was later relieved of his duties on 11 January 2016, one day after having been publicly accused of unprofessionalism by team captain Stefano Sorrentino in the wake of a 1–0 away win at Verona.Palermo caccia Ballardini: il nuovo tecnico è Schelotto On 12 April 2016, he was rehired as coach of Palermo after the sacking of Walter Novellino, the ninth managerial change for the club during the 2015–16 season.http://www.football-italia.net/82713/zamp-ballardini-even-b Personal life Ballardini was born in Ravenna.

The station is owned by Canyon Media. History The 1450 kHz frequency was home to KDXU from 1956 until 1985. In September 1985 KDXU switched its radio frequency to 890 kHz and increased power to 10,000 watts. KDXU broadcast engineer and local cable-TV owner Ray Carpenter filed for a new radio station on 1450 kHz, which was granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC); KATJ began operating with an adult contemporary music format in December using the former KDXU transmitter. The new station took its call letters from Carpenter's six grandchildren: Kelly, Amy, Traci, Troy, Jared and Joel. In November 1986, former Bonneville International executives Joseph A. Kjar, Donald Bybee and Blaine W. Whipple, organizing as Color Country Broadcasting, purchased the station from Carpenter, changing the call sign to KDLX \\"DeLux Radio\\" on January 1, 1987. KDLX moved immediately to new studio facilities Kjar, Whipple, and Bybee sold the station in November 1988 to Las Vegas broadcaster Jack London (Paul G. Maziar) who subsequently filed bankruptcy. London's partner in the purchase was veteran broadcast executive E. Morgan Skinner, Jr., a former Bonneville employee. The two sought to change the station's call letters to KSLI, for their consulting venture, Skinner and London, Inc. The change, which went into effect on November 16, drew the ire of Bonneville for being too close to its KSL radio and television stations in Salt Lake City; Bonneville threatened action against the station and ordered it to stop using the KSLI call letters by November 29. To avoid legal costs, London and Skinner acquiesced and changed the call letters to KSGI. On New Year's Eve 1988, the Quail Creek Reservoir Dam near Hurricane broke, sending a wall of water down the Virgin River and causing over US$11 million of damage to houses, farms, roads and utilities, including KSGI, whose transmitter site was located near the river in St. George. The dam breach destroyed the transmitter building and tower site, sending parts of the transmitter downstream nearly Skinner put the station back to the air within two weeks, with the assistance of Las Vegas broadcaster Steve Gold, Las Vegas-based tower builder Dennis Todd and Las Vegas broadcast engineer Patrick O'Gara. In addition, the group bought the bankrupt KCCZ television station in 1993 and returned it to air as KSGI-TV. Skinner sold the station, together with KZEZ 99.9 FM, which Skinner built with partner Lavon Randall, to Simmons Media Group of St. George in 1998. Simmons operated KSGI under an LMA, changing the call sign to KTSP \\"Total Sports\\" in 1998 and again to KZNU in 2001. Simmons was unsuccessful at getting FCC approval of the purchase, resulting from multiple ownership issues, and partnered with M. Kent Frandsen to organize Canyon Media Corporation, of which Western Broadcasting, LLC (Simmons) retained a thirty-percent (30%) non- attributable interest. Canyon Media Corporation acquired KZNU and KZEZ in 2005; the latter is currently broadcasting country music with the call letters KONY.

It participated in the invasion of Ethiopia in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. The formation was reorganized into the 1st Libyan Division Sibelle by the beginning of Italy's entry into World War II. In September 1940, the 1st Libyan Division participated in the Italian invasion of Egypt. By December, the division was dug in at Maktila and was forced to surrender during Operation Compass.  Origins  Following the Italo-Turkish War of 1911-12, Italy occupied the coastal zones of the twin provinces of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, constituting modern Libya. The Italians continued to face very strong opposition from the Senussi, especially in Cyrenaica. From the beginning the Italian Army made use of the former Turkish organised Arab gendarmerie as auxiliaries, augmenting them with regular colonial units recruited amongst the indigenous peoples of Libya. By 1913 these comprised seven battalions of infantry, three squadrons of savari cavalry, one squadron of meharistes (camel troops), a mountain artillery battery and a section of camel artillery.\\"Le Uniformi Coloniali Libiche 1912-42\\" Piero Crociani 1980 By the 1930s the Libyan units had been brought together into the \\"Royal Corps of Libyan Troops\\" comprising infantry, cavalry, artillery, motorised troops and support services.

Construction of the tower began in 1927 and the building rises 404 feet (123 meters) and has 31 floors. The building, which opened in 1929, was originally named the Smith-Young Tower and is the central component of a partially completed development called the Bowen Island Skyscrapers. The eight sided, neo-gothic brick and Ludowici green terra-cotta tower (complete with gargoyles) was designed by noted local architectural firm Ayres & Ayres (Atlee & Robert M. Ayres). The building also housed San Antonio's first Sears, Roebuck and Company store in its lowest 6 levels.Original 1991 National Register of Historical Places Registration Form with pictures and detailed description The other completed building in the development is the former Plaza Hotel (also designed by Ayres & Ayres), which opened in 1927. The property became the local outlet of Hilton Hotels in 1956 and was converted into the Granada Apartments in 1966. Subsequent structures in the development were never built as a direct result of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. In the 1940s the building was renamed the Transit Tower for the San Antonio Transit Company, which the Smith Brothers purchased in 1943. In 1953 a television transmission tower was added to the structure. Renovations in 2010 removed the obsolete television mast in favor of the tower's original design, a copper tophouse with a 100 ft tall flagpole. The building is now named for its current owner, Tower Life Insurance Company. In 1991 the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.Tower Life Building, San Antonio File:San Antonio River Walk July 2017 23 (Tower Life Building).jpgThe Tower Life Building as viewed from the River Walk File:SA tower view from between.jpgThe building is seen in the background to the right, behind the San Fernando Cathedral.

Biography The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Walker, she was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. In 1910, she married Wilbur Mack, and in 1912 they formed the vaudeville team Mack and Walker. By 1929, she had launched a film acting career, her first film role being in Tanned Legs. She appeared in three films in 1929 and easily transitioned to sound films, appearing in another four films in 1930, possibly making the smooth transition because she was never an established actress in silent films. In 1931, her film career took off, with appearances in 10 films that year, five of which were uncredited. Her marriage ended not long after her film career was on the rise, and from 1932 to 1933, she appeared in 15 films, only five of which were uncredited. In 1935, her career improved, and from this year to 1938, she had 23 film appearances. Her biggest film appearance during this period was in Young Dr. Kildare with Lionel Barrymore and Lew Ayres. Throughout the 1930s, her career was strong, and despite never being a premier star, she repeatedly had solid acting roles. She finished the decade strongly in 1939 with nine film roles, only three of which were uncredited. The 1940s mirrored her success of the previous decade in many ways, with appearances in 37 films from 1940 to 1947. Later in her career, and over 60 years of age, she slowed her career for a time, not having another role until 1950 when she appeared in Nancy Goes to Rio with Ann Sothern and Carmen Miranda. She appeared in another two films in 1952, then had her last film acting role in 1954 in the film Sabrina with Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn. Last years and death She appeared in 117 movies, settling in Los Angeles, where she was residing at the time of her death on March 22, 1971, at age 85.

He was best known for his participation in the Krulak Mendenhall mission to South Vietnam in 1963 with General Victor Krulak. Their vastly divergent conclusions led U.S. President John F. Kennedy to ask if they had visited the same country. Mendenhall continued his work in the Indochina region after Lyndon B. Johnson assumed the presidency in wake of Kennedy's assassination. Early life and education Born in Calvert, Maryland, Mendenhall graduated from the University of Delaware in 1940. Mendenhall also studied at Harvard Law School. He then served in the United States Army during World War II and was commissioned captain. Mendenhall served in the United States Foreign Service and was stationed in Turkey, Iceland, Switzerland, South Vietnam, and worked at the U.S. State Department in Washington, D.C. Mendenhall also studied at the National War College in 1962 and 1963.Hoover Institution archives-Papers of Joseph Abraham Mendenhall'The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: A Political, Social, and Military History,' Volume I, Spencer C. Tucker-editor,' ABC-CLIO, Santa Barbara, California, Denver, Colorado, Oxford, England: 2011, Biographical Sketch of Joseph Abraham Mendenhall, pg. 738  Krulak Mendenhall mission  =Background = In May, civil unrest broke out in South Vietnam following the Hue Vesak shootings. Nine Buddhists were gunned down by the regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem after defying a government ban on the flying of Buddhist flags on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha and marching in an anti-government protest. Following the shootings, Buddhist leaders began to lobby Diem for religious equality and compensation and justice for the families of the victims. With Diem remaining recalcitrant, the protests escalated. The self-immolation of Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc at a busy Saigon intersection was a public relations disaster for the Diem regime, and as protests continued, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces loyal to his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu, raided pagodas across the country on August 21, killing hundreds and causing extensive damage under the declaration of martial law. Universities and high schools were closed amid mass pro-Buddhist protests. In the meantime, the fight against the Vietcong insurgency had begun to lose intensity as rumours spread of sectarian infighting among Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) troops. This was compounded by coup plotting by various ARVN officers which distracted attention from fighting the Vietcong insurgency. In the aftermath of the pagoda raids, the Kennedy administration sent Cable 243 to the US Embassy, Saigon, ordering it to explore alternative leadership possibilities. = Expedition = A fact finding expedition dispatched by the Kennedy administration to South Vietnam in early September 1963. The stated purpose of the expedition was to investigate the progress of the war by South Vietnam and the American military advisers against the Vietcong insurgency. The mission was led by U.S Marine Corps Major General Victor Krulak and Mendenhall. The four-day whirlwind trip was dispatched on the same day of a National Security Council meeting on September 6 and came in the wake of increasingly strained relations between the United States and South Vietnam. Civil unrest gripped that nation as Buddhist demonstrations against the religious discrimination of President Ngo Dinh Diem escalated. Following the raids on Buddhist pagodas on August 21 which left an estimated triple figure death toll, the US had authorised investigations into a possible coup in a cable to US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. as South Vietnam descended into chaos. The report of the conclusion was that Krulak presented an extremely optimistic report on the progress of the war, while Mendenhall presented an extremely bleak picture of military failure and public discontent.

It uses the Doppler effect to provide an audible simulation of the heart beat. Some models also display the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM). Use of this monitor is sometimes known as Doppler auscultation. The Doppler fetal monitor is commonly referred to simply as a Doppler or fetal Doppler. It may be classified as a form of Doppler ultrasonography (although usually not technically -graphy but rather sound- generating). Doppler fetal monitors provide information about the fetus similar to that provided by a fetal stethoscope. One advantage of the Doppler fetal monitor over a (purely acoustic) fetal stethoscope is the electronic audio output, which allows people other than the user to hear the heartbeat. One disadvantage is the greater complexity and cost and the lower reliability of an electronic device. The device was invented in 1958 by Dr. Edward H. Hon,Roger K. Freeman, Thomas J. Garite, Michael P. Nageotte, Fetal Heart Rate Monitoring Third Edition, 2003, p. 3. \\"The earliest preliminary report of FHR monitoring came in 1958 from Edward Hon, MD,... via fetal ECG monitor on the maternal abdomen.\\" Google Books citation Originally intended for use by health care professionals, this device is becoming popular for personal use. Types Fetal Heart Rate and Activity Monitor - Baby Doppler Dopplers for home or hospital use differ in the following ways: *Manufacturer: popular manufacturers Baby Doppler, Sonoline, Ultrasound Technologies, Newman Medical, Nicolet (purchased by Natus), Arjo-Huntleigh, and Summit Doppler (now Cooper Surgical). *Probe type: waterproof or not. Waterproof probes are used for water births. *Probe frequency: 2-MHz or 3-MHz probes. Most practitioners can find the heart rate with either probe. A 3-MHz probe is recommended to detect a heart rate in early pregnancy (8–10 weeks gestation). A 2-MHz probe is recommended for pregnant women who are overweight. The newer EchoHeart 5-MHz transvaginal probes aids in the detection of fetal heart tones (FHT) early in pregnancy (6–8 weeks) and for patients who have a retroverted uterus or throughout pregnancy for FHT detection for women who are obese. *Heart rate display: some Dopplers automatically display the heart rate on a built-in LCD; for others the fetal heart rate must be counted and timed by the practitioner. A major advantage of being able to record and share the recording is that it can be emailed to a healthcare professional to be checked if there are any concerns about whether or not it is the fetus's heart rate and whether or not is normal. Typically, they work from about 12 weeks. In response to increasing home usage of clinical fetal doppler systems, the FDA issued a formal statement recommending against at-home use. Fetal dopplers using 2-3MHz ultrasound are prescription devices designed and developed for use by licensed and trained health care professionals. System misuse (duration, angulation) and systems operating outside of intended range can produce thermal and non- thermal effects on fetal tissue, including the possibility for over-heating fetal tissue and introducing mechanical stress on the fetus due to cavitation, radiation force, and acoustic streaming. The use of the word Sonicaid for Doppler fetal monitors comes from the products of the UK company Sonicaid Ltd. Sonicaid products included the D205/206 portable fetal Dopplers and FM2/3/4 series of fetal monitors. The company was acquired by Oxford Instruments in 1987 to form Oxford Sonicaid.

He was born in Reynolds in Taylor County in west central Georgia. Byrd graduated in 1941 from Reynolds High School. During World War II he served in the United States Army from October 1942 to October 1945 in engineer combat units. He fought in Normandy, Northern France, Germany and Austria. He was discharged at the rank of captain. Byrd attended University of Georgia at Athens from 1946 to 1948, where he was a member of Sigma Chi, and earned LL.B. degree from Emory University School of Law in 1948. A lifelong farmer and real estate businessman, he served as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives from 1947 to 1949 from Taylor County. He resigned from the legislature to become director and then assistant director of the state's Veterans Service Department from 1949 to 1952. Elected Lieutenant Governor in 1958 he served this post from January 13, 1959 to January 15, 1963 under fellow Democrat, Governor Ernest S. Vandiver Jr. After he left the lieutenant governor's position, Byrd was Democratic nominee for U.S. Representative from Georgia's 3rd congressional district in 1964. However, he lost to Republican nominee (and 1966 gubernatorial standard-bearer nominee) Howard Callaway. Byrd hence was the first Georgia Democrat to lose to a Republican congressional candidate since the Reconstruction era. In 1966, Byrd ran as a segregationist in the Democratic primary for governor to succeed the term-limited Carl Sanders but finished in a distant fifth place. In the heated runoff election, Byrd endorsed former Governor Ellis Arnall, considered the liberal candidate, who was defeated for the nomination by Lester Maddox of Atlanta, a segregationist who had closed his Pickrick Restaurant in 1964 to avoid serving African American customers. Maddox termed Byrd's support of Arnall \\"a sellout.\\" The state legislature then elected Maddox over the Republican Howard Callaway when neither candidate obtained an outright majority of the vote in the general election, as was then required by the Georgia State Constitution.Billy Hathorn, \\"The Frustration of Opportunity: Georgia Republicans and the Election of 1966\\", Atlanta History: A Journal of Georgia and the South, XXXI (Winter 1987-1988), pp. 37-39 Byrd was a Freemason.

World Statesmen. Retrieved 2011-02-06. Youth Andrija Radović was born to father serdar (count) Jagoš in the village of Martinići, Danilovgrad into the Bjelopavlići clan, in the still unrecognized Principality of Montenegro on 28 January 1872. After finishing the elementary and secondary schools in Cetinje, he went to professionalize in the Kingdom of Italy studying engineering at the Artillery- Engineering Academy from 1890 to 1894 as Nicholas' Pioneer. Upon returning, he got the job as the Military Engineer later raising to the position of Secretary of the Military Council and Court Marshal. At the end of the century, he was appointed by President of the State Council Božo Petrović- Njegoš as State Engineer, Director of Public Works and Head of Department in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. His 1902 marriage with the Duke's daughter proved to be a decisive connection for his career, as he intimately befriended the dynasty and was frequently sent as its representer on numerous European courts, because of his multi-linguistic capabilities. He actively worked until the general governmental structure was reformed by drafting a Constitution for the Montenegrin Princedom in 1905. From 6 December 1905 to 11 November 1906 he was both Minister of Finance and Construction in the reformist Government of Lazar Mijušković. Democratic Activities Andrija Radović ran in his Captainy on the 27 September 1906 parliamentary elections and was elected into the very first session of the Montenegrin National Assembly that was formed in the capital of Cetinje on 31 October 1906. On 19 January 1907 he was sworn Prime Minister of the Princedom of Montenegro and took the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs and acted as the Representative of both the Ministers of War and Finance. 1907 was a year of great turmoil for Radović. He worked actively in an attempt to limit Prince Nicholas' autocracy and united all members of the Serbian National Assembly of the Princedom of Montenegro into the \\"Club of People's Representatives\\" (Клуб народних представника), which quickly transformed under the influence of neighboring parliamentary democracy in Serbia into the People's Party (Народна странка/Narodna stranka), the first and sole Montenegrin political party. Andrija became one of its two leaders. The movement quickly became known as \\"The Clubists\\" (Клубаши).Jubilej Narodne stranke IN4S Radović rapidly lead the NS into opposition with the Monarch, demanding freedom, democracy and more rights to the people and that the Parliament should be the supreme holder of national sovereignty, and the not the sovereign himself. Disgusted also by the worsening relations of Montenegro with the allied brotherly Kingdom of Serbia, Andrija Radovic went into opposition in the face of Nicholas and promoted national enlightenment of the Montenegrin people and the spread of Serbian culture, religion as well as literacy in Montenegro. He demanded that the long promised union with Serbia started to finally be enacted and worked to cooperate with the Serbs outside Montenegro, as well as other South Slavs, in an attempt to achieve total national liberation and unification. It is because of the liberal actions is that Prince Nikola I Petrović-Njegoš sacked Andrija on 4 April 1907 and prosecuted him and his party, chasing them out of political life. Radović's party boycotted the unilaterally newly scheduled 31 October 1907 parliamentary election, as Nikola created his own True People's Party, the so-called \\"Rightists\\", that supported his regime and managed to get elected with very little votes because they were the only candidates. In the so-called 1908 Cetinje Bomb Trail in which the clubbists were massively prosecuted by the authorities for alleged conspiracies against Prince Nikola, Radović was sentenced to 15 years of prison as a political detainee while Marko Daković (Nikola's nephew) was sentenced to death in absentia. In 1913 King Nicholas succumbed to popular demand and pardoned Andrija and others. This enabled Radović to correct his mistake and run on the 25 October 1913 free parliamentary election. Andrija's party decisively defeated the Rightists in the election. He was appointed State Councilor and since the outbreak of World War I he was in charge for supplying food and ammunition from the Allies for the Montenegrin Army. He was shown particularly successful in securing large amounts of ammo and guns from the neighboring Serbia already in late 1914. He also held the seat of Minister of Finance and Construction once more, this time from 20 December 1915 to 29 April 1916, in the national unity government of Milo Matanović. Exile and unification In early 1916 the Kingdom of Montenegro was being occupied by the Central Powers, so Andrija fled together with Nikola to friendly free Italy. On 12 May 1916 Nicholas convinced him to form a Government of the Kingdom of Montenegro in Exile, which settled in Bordeaux, France. From October '16 he was stationed in Neuilly-sur-Seine which was given to Nicholas by the French for the capital of Montenegro in Exile. 1917 was another year of great activities by Radovic. After the government carefully drafted the Memorandum of Unification of Serbia and Montenegro, he as Prime Minister handed it over to King Nikola. The previous negotiations about forming a Yugoslavian confederate realm in which Montenegro would be an autonomous Principality headed by Nicholas have led to the Montenegrin highest officials in exile working on the matter. However the King didn't sign it to make it official, demanding that the form and process of unification should only be decided after the end of World War I. As a sign of protest, Andrija resigned on 17 January 1917 the Premiership job and on 4 March 1917 he created the \\"Montenegrin Committee for National Unification\\" in Geneva with four other Montenegrin leaders, three Ministers and the High Judge. This Board worked in organizing the Montenegrin internees within Austria-Hungary, most notable of whom was Sekula Drljević, and founded Volunteer Legions sending them to fight on the Balkan Front. The Montenegrin Committee put forward liberation of Montenegro from Austro-Hungarian occupation and unification of Montenegro and Serbia into one state, which would then be joined by other Yugoslavian territories, as its prime goals. Andrija was the Editor-in-Chief of the Committee's \\"Unification\\" magazine printed since April '17 in Geneva that propagated the idea of unification of Serbia and Montenegro with national liberation against the Central Powers' occupation as an integral part of such a movement. For his turning to opposition of Nicholas once more, his financing was cut and he had to search the Serbian government in Exile for support. The \\"Unification\\" was published from August '17 to 15 November 1918 in Paris. The Yugoslav Committee and Serbian Royal Government signed the Corfu Declaration on 20 July 1917 that designed the future Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes; the Montenegrin Board under Andrija Radović gave its consent and adopted the resolution's declarations. Andrija Radović also published his thesis on a democratic election and in detail explained the process of unification in his \\"Unification of Montenegro and Serbia\\" work that summed the basic lines of the Montenegrin government's memorandum. In October '18 Andrija Radovic formed together with three prominent supporters of a union with Serbia a Central Executive Committee for Unification of Serbia and Montenegro, that acted from the recently liberated Berane. On 25 October 1918 Andrija drafted the rules for election of a general Assembly and scheduled the election. As a Deputy of Metropolitan bishop Gavrilo Dožić's White List within the on 19 November 1918 elected \\"Great National Assembly of the Serb People in Montenegro\\", he saw his work fulfilled on 26 November 1918 when unification of the Serbian people was proclaimed and King Nicholas I Petrović dethroned. He wrote a book about the situation in Montenegro and about its potential future inside Serbia, which was used as an informative source by the Allied Powers. The Italian-induced Green insurgents raised the Christmas Uprising on 7 January 1919; Radović supported and coordinated the Montenegrin Youth in fighting off the insurgents and subsequently crushing the remaining guerrilla resisters. Chosen by the Great Serbian People's Assembly for representer of Montenegro, Andrija Radović went as the alongside Nikola Pašić in the Delegation on the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to the 1919-1920 Paris Peace Conference. Radović convinced the victorious Great Powers of Nicholas' dreadful path and made them break off all links with the Montenegrin Government in Exile. As the expert of the Montenegrin Question and offering some sort of a final option to the demanded self-determination of the Montenegrin People which Nikola and his close men pleaded for and worried about the bloody events induced by The Greens, he affirmed an agreement to wait for the Constitutional Assembly general election. In the case of majority's turnout and the victory of pro-unification forces, the created status will have to be accepted by everyone. He proposed the annexation of Skadar and explained its question, which brought him in great conflict with Nikola Pasić who demanded respect of the international territorial integrity of Albania. In '18 the Podgorica Assembly on its last session nominated Andrija as one of the Montenegrin members in the Kingdom's Collective Presidency. He was also elected into the Central Montenegrin Committee for Unification, a provisional executive administrating body for Montenegro in the process of unification. Though seated in Podgorica, Radović managed to move it to Cetinje demanding respect for Montenegro's historical legacy. In August 1919 the Greens decided to attack Radović's property in Martinići, furious because of his acts. A detachment of Green rebels traveled four days from their outland hideout to the area of Podgorica and on 6 August 1919 broke into his family's home. They kidnapped Andrija's mother and sister and assaulted his father, who resisted with his personal gun and ended up quickly killed in the shooting. The Greens then left the building and burned the entire Radović household with the corps in it and then raised the remainder of the property. The house contained all of Andrija's precious things and the historical achievements of his family. He never heard from his mother and only sibling again. Andrija condemned the event and demanded that the perpetrators get punished, but that never occurred. He also called for seizure of violence and reconciliation of the two conflicted political currents in Montenegro. Andrija Radović founded together with other prominent Montenegrin intellectuals the Democratic Party in Montenegro, inspired by the pro-reformist democratic views of the Kingdom's construction of DS. On the 28 November 1920 Constitutional Assembly election, he was elected in Montenegro into the parliament as DS's candidate. The election had international mediators and with more than a 67% turnout in Montenegro and victory of the unionist political options in Montenegro, Radović's unification acts were confirmed and the question was sealed, with the Greens' call for boycott suffering a decisive defeat. Radović's DS managed to continually locally win in the northern areas of former Montenegro. Since 1921 he was member of the Directorate of Monopolies. Reelected into the parliament on the 11 September 1927 parliamentary election on DS's list, he was elected a member of the Yugoslavian National Bank. In 1928 appointed Vice-Governor of the Belgrade-based National Bank, he completely abandoned politics partially disappointed by the poor functioning of democracy in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Permanently moving to Belgrade, he spent the rest of his life there, including the World War II 1941-1944 Axis occupation. He reached an old age and died in 1947.

First published by Hans Berliner in 1979, it is related to the A* search algorithm. Summary The algorithm stores intervals for nodes of the tree as opposed to single point-valued estimates. Then, leaf nodes of the tree can be searched until one of the top level nodes has an interval which is clearly \\"best.\\" Details =Interval evaluations rather than estimates= Leaf nodes of a B*-tree are given evaluations that are intervals rather than single numbers. The interval is supposed to contain the true value of that node. If all intervals attached to leaf nodes satisfy this property, then B* will identify an optimal path to the goal state. =Backup process= To back up the intervals within the tree, a parent's upper bound is set to the maximum of the upper bounds of the children. A parent's lower bound is set to the maximum of the lower bound of the children. Note that different children might supply these bounds. =Termination of search= B* systematically expands nodes in order to create \\"separation,\\" which occurs when the lower bound of a direct child of the root is at least as large as the upper bound of any other direct child of the root. A tree that creates separation at the root contains a proof that the best child is at least as good as any other child. In practice, complex searches might not terminate within practical resource limits. So the algorithm is normally augmented with artificial termination criteria such as time or memory limits. When an artificial limit is hit, then you must make a heuristic judgment about which move to select. Normally, the tree would supply you with extensive evidence, like the intervals of root nodes. =Expansion= B* is a best-first process, which means that it is very efficient to traverse the tree, repeatedly descending to find a leaf to expand. This section describes how to choose the node to expand. (Note: Whether or not the tree is memory- resident, is a function of the overall implementation efficiency, including how it may be mapped and/or managed via real or virtual memory.) At the root of the tree, the algorithm applies one of two strategies, called prove-best and disprove-rest. In the prove-best strategy, the algorithm selects the node associated with the highest upper bound. The hope is that expanding that node will raise its lower bound higher than any other node's upper bound. The disprove-rest strategy selects the child of the root that has the second- highest upper bound. The hope is that by expanding that node you might be able to reduce the upper bound to less than the lower bound of the best child. Strategy selection Note that applying the disprove-rest strategy is pointless until the lower bound of the child node that has the highest upper bound is the highest among all lower bounds. The original algorithm description did not give any further guidance on which strategy to select. There are several reasonable alternatives, such as expanding the choice that has the smaller tree. Strategy selection at non-root nodes Once a child of the root has been selected (using prove-best or disprove-rest) then the algorithm descends to a leaf node by repeatedly selecting the child that has the highest upper bound. When a leaf node is reached, the algorithm generates all successor nodes and assigns intervals to them using the evaluation function. Then the intervals of all nodes have to be backed up using the backup operation. When transpositions are possible, then the back-up operation might need to alter the values of nodes that did not lie on the selection path. In this case, the algorithm needs pointers from children to all parents so that changes can be propagated. Note that propagation can cease when a backup operation does not change the interval associated with a node. =Robustness= If intervals are incorrect (in the sense that the game- theoretic value of the node is not contained within the interval), then B* might not be able to identify the correct path. However, the algorithm is fairly robust to errors in practice. The Maven (Scrabble) program has an innovation that improves the robustness of B* when evaluation errors are possible. If a search terminates due to separation then Maven restarts the search after widening all of the evaluation intervals by a small amount. This policy progressively widens the tree, eventually erasing all errors. =Extension to two-player games= The B* algorithm applies to two-player deterministic zero-sum games. In fact, the only change is to interpret \\"best\\" with respect to the side moving in that node. So you would take the maximum if your side is moving, and the minimum if the opponent is moving. Equivalently, you can represent all intervals from the perspective of the side to move, and then negate the values during the back-up operation. =Applications= Andrew Palay applied B* to chess. Endpoint evaluations were assigned by performing null-move searches. There is no report of how well this system performed compared to alpha-beta pruning search engines running on the same hardware. The Maven (Scrabble) program applied B* search to endgames. Endpoint evaluations were assigned using a heuristic planning system. The B* search algorithm has been used to compute optimal strategy in a sum game of a set of combinatorial games.

When he reached Kampala in Uganda he saw the name of Skagit Valley College, Washington state, in a US Information service directory, so he applied and was awarded a place and a scholarship.\\"Destination: Skagit Valley\\", Time Magazine, 19 December 1960, p. 60. Kayira then embarked on a journey of more than 3000 kilometres and walked to Khartoum, Sudan, where he obtained a visa, and people from Skagit Valley raised the money to bring him over to Washington. He arrived at Skagit Valley two years after setting out. After graduating from Skagit Valley, he went on to study Political Science at the University of Washington in Seattle, and then read History at Cambridge University in the UK. Subsequently he worked as a probation officer and was the author of several novels.\\"Legson Kayira\\", themodernnovel.org. His autobiography, I Will Try, was on the New York Times bestseller list for 16 weeks after its publication in 1965.Carol Forsloff, \\"Great Loss to Africa, Remembering Legson Kayira of Malawi\\", Digital Journal, 28 March 2009. He made his home in England, and died in London on 14 October 2012. In October, 2014, an American charitable organization called \\"Youth of Malawi\\" built a primary school in the rural Malawian village of Chimphamba and named it after Legson Kayira. The Legson Kayira Primary School and Community Center is solar-powered, rainwater harvesting, and boasts an outdoor movie projecter. On October 13, 2016, Legson's ashes were to be interred in Chimphamba Village, during a memorial ceremony attended by his children.

AXIS Dance Company is a professional physically integrated contemporary dance company and dance education organization founded in 1987 and based in Oakland, California. It is one of the first contemporary dance companies in the world to consciously develop choreography that integrates dancers with and without physical disabilities. Their work has received nine Isadora Duncan Dance Awards and nine additional nominations for both their artistry and production values. Physically integrated dance Founded in 1987 by Thais Mazur, Bonnie Lewkowicz, Judith Smith and others, AXIS was one of the first contemporary dance companies in the world to consciously develop choreography that integrates dancers with and without physical disabilities. AXIS dancers with disabilities have included wheelchair users (both manual wheelchairs and power wheelchairs), crutch users, and people with amputations using prosthetic limbs. AXIS dancers who are not disabled come with training in a variety of contemporary dance, improvisation and other movement practices. Through interactions between these dancers and nondisabled dancers, a new dance vocabulary began to be developed. This started a trend, which eventually became known as physically integrated dance, which seeks to broaden the definition of ‘dance’ and ‘dancer’ and increase opportunities for artistic expression through movement for a wide spectrum of physical attributes and disabilities.Interview, Judith Smith, “Artistic Director, AXIS Dance Company” conducted by Esther Ehrlich in 2005, Regional Oral History Office, The Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, 2006.

Ownership The team was owned by Swiss businessman Andy Rihs until his death.http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/bmc-racing-owner-andy-rihs-dies-aged-75/ After his death the team passed to Jim Ochowicz and Gavin Chilcott. History The team was founded as BMC Racing Team in 2007, sponsored by the bicycle manufacturer BMC Switzerland. The team signed a number of major international riders for the 2010 season, including 2009 World Champion, two- time Tour de France runner-up and 2011 winner Cadel Evans, 2009 U.S. Road Race Champion George Hincapie, 2008 World Champion Alessandro Ballan and Spring Classics specialists Karsten Kroon and Marcus Burghardt. In 2010 the team participated in their first Grand Tours, having been invited to compete in the 2010 Tour de France and the 2010 Giro d'Italia. In 2011, the team attained UCI ProTeam status, the most prestigious classification available, and BMC rider Cadel Evans won the 2011 Tour de France. For 2012 the team signed Thor Hushovd and Philippe Gilbert, the 2010 and 2012 world-champions respectively. In 2012, Evans was unable to defend his title at the Tour de France, finishing in seventh overall, two places behind teammate Tejay van Garderen. Cadel Evans placed third overall at the 2013 Giro d'Italia. At the 2013 Tour de France, Cadel Evans finished 39th, Tejay van Garderen 45th, with Steve Morabito the highest placed overall at 35th. Shortly after the end of the Tour, it was announced that John Lelangue, who had been directeur sportif since the team was founded in 2007, was leaving the team \\"for personal reasons\\". In September 2013 Jim Ochowicz announced the appointment of Valerio Piva as Lelangue's replacement. For the 2015 season, BMC signed Alessandro De Marchi, Damiano Caruso and Jempy Drucker for the 2015 season The team also announced they had signed Rohan Dennis - his transfer however was effective immediately. Avermaet finished 8th in the World Tour individual classification. Meanwhile, the team won the Team Time Trial World Championship. For the 2016 season, the team signed Richie Porte. He scored podiums at the Tour Down Under and Paris–Nice to finish 7th in the World Tour individual classification, whereas Van Avermaet finished 6th overall after winning the Tirreno–Adriatico and GP de Montréal. In the 2017 season, Van Avermaet won the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, E3 Harelbeke, Gent–Wevelgem and the Paris–Roubaix, therefore he claimed the first place at the World Tour individual classification. Porte finished 12th overall, having won the Tour Down Under and Tour de Romandie. BMC ranked third in the World Tour points classification. In the 2018 season, Porte won the Tour de Suisse. In July 2018 the team announced that CCC would become the new title sponsor of the Continuum Sports-owned team, a move that would expand CCC's presence in cycling, with CCC's Professional Continental team, CCC Sprandi Polkowice, stepping down to the Continental level for the 2019 season as CCC Development Team. Van Avermaet will continue as leader, whereas Porte is expected to leave the team. Doping In April 2010, Thomas Frei tested positive for erythropoietin (EPO), Frei was immediately withdrawn from racing by the team. Frei was later sacked by the team. In August 2017, the UCI confirmed that Samuel Sanchez had returned a positive out of competition drug test for GHRP-2 (Pralmorelin).

A return specialist or kick returner is a player on the special teams unit of a gridiron football team who specializes in returning punts and kickoffs. There are few players who are exclusively return specialists; most also play another position such as wide receiver, defensive back, or running back. The special teams counterpart of a return specialist is a kicking specialist. According to All-American Venric Mark, \\"Returning punts is harder. You have to judge the ball more, you have to know when to fair catch and when not to. You can't be a superhero and try to catch everything. With kickoff returns, you catch the ball and — boom — you're going.\\" Kickoff returner A kickoff returner (KR) is the player on special teams who is primarily responsible for catching the opposing team's kickoff and attempting to run it towards the end zone to score a touchdown. If the ball is kicked into his own end zone, the kick returner must assess the situation on the field while the ball is in the air and determine if it would be beneficial to his team for a return. If he decides that it is not, he can make a touchback by kneeling down in the end zone after catching the ball, ending the play and starting the next play at the 25-yard line to start the drive. The kickoff returner position is often played by a small, faster player such as a cornerback, running back or wide receiver. Backup players frequently assume this role so starting players on the offense take fewer hits as the kickoff returner position, and can play their regular positions. In the days of one platoon football, the returner position was synonymous with the \\"safety man\\" - a quarterback or halfback. In 2012, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell proposed the idea of removing the kickoff play, and quoted that the \\"kickoff return is too dangerous for the game\\". The idea was met with criticism and the idea was eventually dropped. However, rule changes during his tenure have greatly reduced the frequency of NFL kickoff returns. The most significant one was in 2011, when the NFL changed the starting position of the kickoff from the 30 to the 35-yard line, resulting in far more kickoffs going through the end zone or so deep into the end zone that the returner would usually take a touchback. In 2015, another rule change made the touchback give the receiving team the ball on their 25-yard line instead of the 20. On October 27, 2013, wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson of the Minnesota Vikings returned the kickoff 109 yards and scored a touchdown, the longest run possible in NFL standards. In 2014, Devin Hester broke Deion Sanders' record for most kickoff return touchdowns, with 14. He currently remains the record holder. =Notable kickoff returners= *In the movie Forrest Gump, Forrest was an All-American kick returner for the Alabama Crimson Tide under Bear Bryant in the mid 1960s. * Brian Mitchell, who played running back in the NFL for 14 seasons, is the league's career leader in kickoff return yards (14,014) and punt return yards (4,999) by a very wide margin. *Red Grange was one of the sport's first iconic faces, breaking onto the national scene with a 95-yard kickoff return against Michigan. *Gale Sayers was an All-Pro running back who also returned punts and kicked for the Chicago Bears. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1977. He currently holds the record for the highest career kickoff return average at 30.56 yards per attempt. Brad Oremland of Sports Central called him the greatest kick returner in NFL history. *Deion Sanders played cornerback for multiple NFL teams and also played kick returner and a punt returner on special teams. Sanders was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011. Sanders totaled 3,523 kick return yards in his career, including 3 touchdowns. Sanders held the record for most special teams touchdowns, 19 in total, until Devin Hester broke the record in the 2014 season. *Desmond Howard, MVP of Super Bowl XXXI. Howard is the only player ever to win Super Bowl MVP exclusively due to his special teams performance, setting Super Bowl records for longest kickoff return (99 yards), punt return yards (90), total return yards (244) and combined net yards (244). Incidentally, his 99 yard kickoff return in the game was the only kickoff return touchdown of his entire career. *Dante Hall played wide receiver and as a kick returner \\"was the most dangerous player in the NFL for a couple of seasons\\". *Devin Hester played wide receiver and as a return specialist holds the record for the most all- time return touchdowns and most all-time punt return touchdowns. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, return specialist in NFL history. *Glyn Milburn holds the NFL record for most all-purpose yards in a single game, set while playing for the Denver Broncos (404 yards on December 10, 1995) with John Elway quarterbacking. One of the greatest return specialists of all time, he became the Chicago Bears all-time leading kick returner with 4,596 yards. He had 9,788 NFL career kick returning total yards. He also holds the Denver Broncos' franchise record for the most kick return yards in a single season, with 1,269 in 1995. *Josh Cribbs He has tied the NFL career record with eight kickoff returns for touchdowns, and also the NFL record with two kickoffs of 100 yards or more returned for touchdowns in a single game. Punt returner Air Force returning a punt in 2003. A punt returner (PR) has the job of catching the ball after it is punted and to give his team good field position (or a touchdown if possible) by returning it. Before catching the punted ball, the returner must assess the situation on the field while the ball is still in the air. He must determine if it is actually beneficial for his team to attempt a return. If it appears that the players from the punting team will be too close to the returner by the time he catches the ball, or it appears the ball will go into his own end zone, the punt returner can elect not to return the ball by choosing one of two options: *Call for a fair catch by waving one arm above his head before catching the punt. This means that the play will end once the catch is made; the punt returner's team will get the ball at the spot of the catch and no return attempt can be made. The fair catch minimizes the chances of a fumble or injury because it ensures that the returner is fully protected from the opposing team, whose players may not touch the returner or attempt to interfere with the catch in any way after the fair catch signal is given. In the NFL, a fair catch also allows the fair catch kick to be used on the next play, even with no time on the clock remaining, to attempt a field goal via free kick. However, this option is rarely exercised. *Avoid the ball and let it hit the ground. Under this option the ball will go into the returning team's end zone for a touchback, go out of bounds and be spotted at that point, or come to final rest in the field of play and be downed by a player on the punting team. This is the safest option, as it completely eliminates the chance of a fumble and ensures that the returner's team will get possession of the ball. However, it also provides an opportunity for the punting team to pin the returner's team deep in their own territory by downing the ball or sending it out of bounds near the returner's end zone. This can not only give the return team poor field position, but can even lead to a safety. Punt returners sometimes also return kickoffs and usually play other positions, especially wide receiver, cornerback and running back, although sometimes as backups. An analogous position exists in Canadian football, though differences in rules affect play considerably. See comparison of Canadian and American football for a complete discussion of the punt returner's role in the Canadian game.

During the course of 2007, Sony announced several new PlayStation 3 SKUs and discontinued others. The new 40 GB, 80 GB and 160 GB PlayStation 3 models do not feature software emulation of PlayStation 2 hardware.

During this journey, the scenery and the people that Sun-seok sees and meets along the way brings back his memories of his deceased wife. On his journey to his wife's hometown, Sun-seok arrives in a small town called Mulchi. At a local inn, he meets a group of hikers who invite him to join them in gambling and indulging time with some prostitutes. After the group of hikers leave the inn, the inn owner approaches Sun-seok for a favor. The inn owner introduces Sun-seok to an ill old man and his nurse. This old man wants to go back to his hometown, Wolsan, one last time before he dies, but due to his illness he lost his ability to talk and was unable to express his last wish to his son. Ms. Choi, the old man's personal nurse, helps him escape the son's house but they needed a man's help them get to his hometown up north from Mulchi. After the son discovers that his dad is missing, the son sends some men to find them and bring the father back to his home. The local inn owner tells Sun-seok that they are willing to pay him 100,000 won if he helps them with the final stretch of their journey. Sun-seok declines the offer. After declining the offer Sun-seok looks for the group of hikers at their motel. There, a hiker introduces a prostitute that looks like Sun-seok's late wife to him. After sleeping with the prostitute, she suddenly gets a seizure and dies. One of the hiker informs Sun-seok of her death and tells him that he can leave quietly and not get caught up with police affairs. He takes the hiker's offer and leaves quietly. Sun-seok returns to the local inn and asks the inn owner if the nurse and old man still needs help, but he discovers that they already left in a taxi-cab on their own. Sun-seok continues on his journey and he eventually reaches the next town and stays at another local inn. The inn owner sends a prostitute over to him; this is the second prostitute that also looks like Sun-seok's late wife. After sleeping together, this prostitute also suddenly dies in the morning, leaving Sun-seok in disbelief. After collecting himself he continues his journey to the bus station. He wants to buy a ticket to Wontong to find to the nurse and old man but because of the expecting snow storm buses were not running for the rest of the day. However, a taxi-cab offers to drive him to Wontong for a much higher price. Sun-seok agrees to pay the fair, and on his way to Wontong, he runs into the two men that are looking for the old man and Ms. Choi. Sun-seok decides to tag along with these two men in order to find Ms. Choi. They find them in a small inn later that day; the two men bring the old man back to his son's home and coerce Ms. Choi to sign a contract saying she would not expose the old man's wishes to return home to the press. After the men leave, Ms. Choi tells Sun-seok that if he had decided to help them sooner then the events would have turned out differently. Ms. Choi invites Sun-seok to have dinner with her at a local inn, and they chat about their hometown and their next destination. Their meeting seems fateful as Ms. Choi mentions “Auraji River”, a river that Sun-seok's late wife had mention to him before. Ms. Choi also mentions how a fortune teller once told her that at the age of thirty she will meet a man with three coffins behind his back; this man is her husband from a previous life. After a heart-to-heart exchange about their lives, they end up sleeping together. On the morning he decides to leave for Seoul, he takes the rest of his wife's ashes and sends it off with the winter wind. Ms. Choi walks with Sun-seok to the river with the boat that will take him back to Seoul. On their walk, Ms. Choi explains the old man's situation and his family situation to Sun-seok and tears up the old man's only photo with his family members that still live in his hometown. As they are approaching the pier, Sun-seok proposes to Ms. Choi by suggesting that they work towards buying a house together after she visits her hometown and then they reunite in Seoul. As they approach the pier, they see shamans perform some sort of ritual. As Sun-seok sets off to Seoul, Ms. Choi suddenly joins the shaman ritual as she dances in the ritual. Sun-seok is in shock looking at the scene. When he looks at the mountainous horizon, he suddenly sees a large hand that appears. The hand comes closer and closer until only the palm of the hand can be seen. Sun-seok screams and the movie ends, cutting to the credits. Cast * Lee Bo-hee...

Sashimi shop owner * Yu Sun * Gwon Sun-cheol * Kim Dae-hwan * Lee Eun-young * Kim Sun-ae * Im Gwi-ryeon Themes = Korean War and Displacement = One of the main themes of this film is displacement of families. After the Korean War, the Korean DMZ line redefined the physical geographical boundary lines of many homes and families. The division between North and South Korea made it impossible for families to return to their hometown and even keep in touch. One example is Sun-seok's deceased wife. Sun-seok and his wife lived in South Korea, but her hometown is in the DMZ area that is restricted. As a result, he cannot actually get to her hometown to spread her ashes; he is only able to at most get as close as the DMZ line will allow him. DMZ line aside, Sun-seok still has an extremely difficult time getting as close as he legally can because no one he has crossed roads with in South Korea is very familiar with the landscape his late wife had once described to him. Another example is the old man that Ms. Choi tries helping. In The Man with Three Coffins, Ms. Choi explains that the old man has repeatedly expressed his wishes to go back to his hometown to die. The son only considers South Korea to be their home because it is where he had many new-found opportunities and was even able to establish his own successful business and wealth for his family. As a result, the son ignores his father's wishes and continues to insist that South Korea is their only home. Despite Ms. Choi's help the mission was unsuccessful and the old man is brought back to the son's home by the son's men. = Korean Shamanism = Korean Shamanism in The Man with Three Coffins was shown through related imagery of shamanism as well as the discussion of ideas of fate and reincarnation. Some of the imagery and shamanism included cut scenes of bells and scenes of shaman rituals. An example of fate and reincarnation includes Ms. Choi's encounter with a shaman that told her that she was going to meeting a man with three coffins and he is her husband from a previous life.  Film's Critical Response  The Man with Three Coffins artistically portrays the suffering and loss of the families from the north who have been uprooted by the Korean War through non-conventional story-telling; Lee Jang-ho experimental storytelling involved a mixture of the present timeline of Sun- seok's journey to spread his late wife's ashes, shamanistic rituals, encounters with women that look like his wife, and his own flashbacks of his late wife. The seemingly illogical division between shamanism and reality to capture one's strong desire return to one's hometown in North Korea suggests that the reality of the situation of division is deeply embedded in society and is what links people together. The film was also praised for the sepia tones over the film. In an interview, Lee Jang-ho said that the sepia tones were inspired by the colored glass that he and his friends used to hold over their eyes to see the world in different colors, old sepia-colored war newsreels, and the Claude Lelouch's Un homme et une femme (1966). The film was also highly praised for its pansori and shamanistic sounds that interweave and bleed into one another throughout the story.  Film Festivals and Accolades  The Man with Three Coffins has been invited and screened at various film festivals around the world, including: # Busan International Film Festival: BIFF (2018) - Korean Cinema Retrospective # London Korean Film Festival (2016) - CLASSICS REVISITED: Lee Chang-ho Retrospective # Marrakech International Film Festival (2009) - Tribute to South Korean Cinema # Berlin International Film Festival (1988) - Forum In addition to being invited and screened at film festivals, the production team and staff members were also nominated for awards for this film soon after its release. Director Lee Jang-ho received the International Critics Association Award at the 2nd Tokyo International Film Festival (1987), and he also received a special prize in Film Division at the 24th Baeksang Arts Prize (1988). In 1988, Park Seung Bae was nominated and won the Award for Photography at the 8th Korean Film Critics Association Award (Youngpyeong Award). Although New Yorker Films purchased the rights for distribution in the US, the film was never released in theaters.https://twitter.com/MilestoneFilms/status/1214604387739406336?s=20 If it would have been released, it would have been the first South Korean film released in the United States. * References Category:1987 films Category:Korean-language films Category:South Korean films Category:Films directed by Lee Jang-ho ","title":"The Man with Three Coffins"},{"id":"14994127","text":"Campo Alegre (Portuguese or Spanish: happy field) may refer to: *Campo Alegre, a neighbourhood in Caracas, Venezuela. *Campo Alegre, Oporto, a parish in Oporto, Portugal. *Campo Alegre, Alagoas, a Brazilian municipality in the state of Alagoas *Campo Alegre, Puerto Rico, a space for farmers' market in the District of Santurce *Campo Alegre, Santa Catarina, a Brazilian municipality in the state of Santa Catarina *Campo Alegre, an open-air brothel in Curaçao ","title":"Campo Alegre"},{"id":"14994135","text":"Herbert Charles \\"Barney\\" Mellows (29 March 1896 – 25 February 1942) was an Irish Sinn Féin politician, and the brother of Liam Mellows.

Named using the German \\"Turnen\\", meaning gymnastics or physical fitness, it is significant for its association with the American Turners, a German-American athletic, cultural, and political association. The Milwaukee group was founded in 1853 under the title, \\"Socialist Turnverein\\"; its leaders included Socialist Congressman Victor Berger.Gruen, Mardee. \\"Milwaukee Turners, local Jews go back 141 years.\\" Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle April 29, 1994; p. 6, col. 1 The building is one of the largest and most distinctive surviving buildings associated with the Turner movement, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1996. and It is now used as a performance and meeting venue. Description and history The Turner movement was founded in Germany in 1811 by Friedrich Ludwig Jahn as a gymnastic association called Turnverein, encouraging harmonious development of mind and body - to some extent a reaction to French domination during the Napoleonic Wars. After the failed revolutions of 1848, German political and economic refugees came to America, and some brought Turner ideas with them. A society was organized in Milwaukee in 1853, called the Sozializer Turnveirein Milwaukee, then renamed Turnverein Milwaukee. Their creed was \\"Free speech, free press, free assembly for discussion of all questions so that men and women may think unfettered and order their lives by the dictates of conscience.\\" with The Turner Society in Milwaukee grew and by the 1880s they needed a new meeting hall. The building was designed by architect Henry C. Koch, and was completed in 1882, with an addition in 1899. In keeping with the Turner movement's philosophy, the interior is decorated with artwork, including rare murals by German immigrant artists. Stained glass windows are adorned with political slogans relating to the Turner's progressive political stances. left Turner Hall stands in Milwaukee's Westown downtown area, on the east side of North 4th Street between West Highland Avenue and West State Street. It is a four-story masonry building, built out of brick in a High Victorian style. Its front facade is elaborate, with projecting gabled sections near the outer corners, and a central entrance set deeply recessed under another projection. The central section rises to a five-story pyramid- capped tower. The interior includes a ballroom with balcony level, restaurant and beer hall and meeting rooms. A gymnasium with modernized facilities is located in the building basement. In 1994 the Governor proclaimed Turner Hall one of the \\"Ten Most Endangered Historic Sites\\" in Wisconsin. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1996. In 2000, The Milwaukee Turners established the Turner Ballroom Preservation Trust to renovate and maintain the building. It now hosts a wide variety of concerts. The Turner Hall Ballroom was awarded the \\"Venue of the Year\\" at the 2010 Wisconsin Area Music Industry (WAMI) awards.

His film acting career began during the silent film era. Biography Mack was born and raised in Binghamton, New York, and began acting professionally when he joined a repertory theatre when he was 16. He found success performing vaudeville with first wife Nella Walker (\\"Mack and Walker\\"). The couple divorced not far into the marriage and Walker subsequently found success as a supporting actress in the \\"talkies.\\" Mack, meantime, found a new partner: Gertrude Purdy, with whom he reprised his popular husband and wife vaudeville routine (this time headlined \\"Mack and Purdy\\"). In addition to performing, Mack wrote dialogue for skits and words and music for songs in their vaudeville shows. In 1925 Mack entered into a film acting career. His first film appearance was Gold and Grit. With wife Gertrude, he also wrote and performed in a Vitaphone romantic comedy pantomime An Everyday Occurrence (1928). Mack made a smooth transition to talking films, but despite racking up an impressive number of appearances had less success finding lead or even featured roles. In 1930 he made thirteen films; from 1931 through 1933 he appeared in twenty-four; and from 1934 until 1939, he was cast fifty-five times. However, forty-five of those appearances were uncredited. His most notable credited role during that period was the 1936 crime drama The Crime Patrol, alongside Ray Walker. Mack's career in subsequent decades was similar to his career up until that point, with moviegoers seeing him play mostly uncredited roles. Of the seventy-six film appearances he made from 1940 to 1949, only seven were credited. He would continue to appear in both films and television throughout the 1950s and into 1962, with his last being an uncredited part in the 1962 movie Who's Got the Action? starring Dean Martin, Lana Turner, Eddie Albert, and Walter Matthau. Mack was living in Hollywood when he died on March 13, 1964, and was survived by his wife Gertrude (1896-1967).

Rural Poverty According to a recent 'Der Spiegel' article, the children who attend the elementary school in Chynów are suffering the consequences of rising food prices, to the point that a school meal is the best meal a child may receive, and has come to represent a major incentive for a child to attend school. This state of affairs is difficult to reconcile with the facts that Poland is a contributor to many international and EU-wide food- aid programmes, and Chynów is situated in an area well endowed with agricultural land. As to why such a problem has arisen with regard to food supply, above and beyond the current rise in prices, it would seem likely that lack of food production is due to EU agricultural policies and /or mal- administration at the state and/or county levels.

Definition  Elements {e,h,f} of a Lie algebra g form an sl2-triple if : [h,e] = 2e, \\\\quad [h,f] = -2f, \\\\quad [e,f] = h.

The alternative notation for the elements of an sl2-triple is {H, X, Y}, with H corresponding to h, X corresponding to e, and Y corresponding to f.  Properties  Assume that g is a finite dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero. From the representation theory of the Lie algebra sl2, one concludes that the Lie algebra g decomposes into a direct sum of finite-dimensional subspaces, each of which is isomorphic to Vj, the (j + 1)-dimensional simple sl2-module with highest weight j. The element h of the sl2-triple is semisimple, with the simple eigenvalues j, j − 2, …, −j on a submodule of g isomorphic to Vj . The elements e and f move between different eigenspaces of h, increasing the eigenvalue by 2 in case of e and decreasing it by 2 in case of f. In particular, e and f are nilpotent elements of the Lie algebra g. Conversely, the Jacobson–Morozov theorem states that any nilpotent element e of a semisimple Lie algebra g can be included into an sl2-triple {e,h,f}, and all such triples are conjugate under the action of the group ZG(e), the centralizer of e in the adjoint Lie group G corresponding to the Lie algebra g. The semisimple element h of any sl2-triple containing a given nilpotent element e of g is called a characteristic of e. An sl2-triple defines a grading on g according to the eigenvalues of h: : g = \\\\bigoplus_{j\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}} g_j,\\\\quad [h, a]= ja {\\\\ \\\\ }\\\\textrm{ for } {\\\\ \\\\ } a\\\\in g_j. The sl2-triple is called even if only even j occur in this decomposition, and odd otherwise. If g is a semisimple Lie algebra, then g0 is a reductive Lie subalgebra of g (it is not semisimple in general). Moreover, the direct sum of the eigenspaces of h with non-negative eigenvalues is a parabolic subalgebra of g with the Levi component g0. If the elements of an sl2-triple are regular, then their span is called a principal subalgebra.

Cemetery) is a pioneer cemetery in Eugene, Oregon, United States. It is one of the three oldest cemeteries in Eugene. It is the largest in both acreage and burials encompassing with approximately 5,000 burials. History The cemetery was founded in 1872 by the Spencer Butte Lodge No. 9 of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. The cemetery is located adjacent to the campus of the University of Oregon but is not affiliated with the college. It is situated across University street from McArthur Court and is behind the Knight Library. In at least three sessions of the Oregon State Legislature, bills were introduced which would have allowed the University of Oregon to condemn the property, remove graves, and build on the land; the last attempt was in January 1963 with the submission of studies presented to the University of Oregon by the Springfield architecture firm of Lutes and Amundson. All of the legislative bills died in committee. The cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Notable burials in the cemetery include Louis Renninger, who was awarded the Medal of Honor in the American Civil War. Renninger is one of one hundred and forty-five Civil War veterans buried in the cemetery. There is also a section for Spanish–American War veterans and there are many veterans from World War I and World War II. G.A.R. burial plot G.A.R. plot at Eugene Pioneer Cemetery The \\"signature\\" of the Eugene Pioneer Cemetery is the Grand Army of the Republic burial plot located near the center of the cemetery. The plot was purchased in 1887 by the Gen. John W. Geary post of the Eugene G.A.R. There are fifty-seven known graves in the plot including fifty-one Civil War veterans and six women and children. In the center of the plot stands a twenty-five-foot statue of a Union soldier. In 1903, Union veteran John Covell's estate, valued at $2,500, specified that a monument be placed at the G.A.R. plot where he was laid to rest. The bequest was challenged in court by Covell's relatives, but a Eugene judge ruled in favor of the G.A.R. The statue was carved in Vermont and shipped by rail to Eugene. The statue was brought to the cemetery by an eight horse team and raised by block and tackle. In December 2001, vandals broke the head of the statue off and pulverized it. Local artist David Miller was commissioned to sculpt a replacement. An 800-pound block of blue marble was obtained from the same Vermont quarry where the original statue was carved one hundred years before. The new head was installed in February 2003 and dedicated that Memorial Day. In 2007 the G.A.R. plot underwent a major restoration by the Col. Edward D. Baker camp of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War. Notable burials *James Henry Dickey Henderson (1810–1885), U.S. Representative from Oregon *Harrison R.

The show was produced by Visual Voodoo and the executive producer was Ben Devlin. This was filmed four months before Evel's death. Subject The documentary is based around the Evel Knievel Days event in Butte, Montana. The presenter, Richard Hammond, spends four days with former motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel. Knievel, by now 69 years old, had become very ill, requiring an oxygen tank strapped up to him constantly to aid with breathing. 48 hours before the film crew arrived, Knievel had a stroke. At several points during filming, Knievel cuts the interview short and leaves before Hammond has finished asking questions. During the festival Knievel was meant to lead a bike parade, and invited Hammond to ride alongside him, but he was taken to hospital and was unable to lead the parade. He later showed up at the end of the day. On the last day of the festival fellow daredevil Trigger Gumms completed a jump over double what Evel jumped. The day after, in the local newspaper Knievel stated he was not impressed with the jump. Hammond also conducts interviews with Knievel's former bodyguard Gene Sullivan, former daredevil Debbie Lawler and his former publicist Shelly Saltman, who was assaulted by Knievel in 1977, an attack which destroyed Evel's reputation and eventually caused him to declare himself bankrupt. On the final day of filming, Evel asked Hammond to go and view his tombstone which he had paid for himself. Archive clips shown during the programme and discussed with Knievel include his jumps at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, Snake River Canyon, Idaho and Wembley Stadium, London as well as his conversion in the Crystal Cathedral in California. Evel died four months after the show was filmed but before the programme was first broadcast. Knievel is sympathetically but, at the same time, revealingly portrayed as a bitter old man that surely lives up to his legend (showing up for disturbing screenings and even more challenging interviews about his former traumatic failures, despite being ill and in excruciating pain, but displaying nothing more than a grudging attitude), but is reluctant to face the moral challenges that come with re-living his relationships with his family, his \\"rock'n'roll star\\" behaviour patterns and, ultimately, the issue of surviving his career by a long stretch. Knievel's inner controversies are captured in his reluctance to be interviewed by Hammond in the first place, and punctuated by editing and writing of the documentary. Hammond feels somewhat embarrassed to pursue his goal of clarifying the feelings of Evel about his career during the interviews (given the struggle between admiration and ire of being constantly put off by Knievel), and thus gives the viewer even more insight into the Evel's personality and the phenomenon behind his popularity. Finally, the film clearly shows Knievel shutting himself off the BBC filming team, as he finally thanks Hammond in a polite way, but firmly advises him to \\"get on his airplane and get outta here\\". Production Filming took place on location in Butte, Montana from 25–29 July 2007. It can be seen during the programme that Sony DVW-790WSP Digital Betacam cameras were used to provide a widescreen (16:9 aspect ratio) 576i standard definition picture. The documentary progresses through the five filming days in sequence. Pre-arranged interviews with Knievel and other related persons are combined with archive footage, some of which is also shown to the interviewee. Around this, some coverage of the Evel Knievel Days festival is provided, and the sections are linked together by piece to camera segments by Hammond or shots of Hammond riding around Butte on a rented Harley-Davidson motorcycle with voice-over. Hammond conveyed his thoughts before and after a day's filming in a video-diary style filmed in his hotel room at the Lincoln Hotel. In an interview with Radio Times, Hammond described himself as being \\"fascinated, terrified and elated\\" to be in the company of Evel Knievel. Hammond said that during the filming, Knievel \\"shouted at me, the crew and the people with him constantly\\" Reception James Walton—writing for The Daily Telegraph—said he was surprised to find Richard Hammond Meets Evel Knievel \\"a pretty rich documentary\\" describing its real strength as \\"[serving] up lashings of the kind of pure Americana that many other British documentaries have striven much harder for, without matching.\\" The Scotsman presented a more mixed view saying it was a \\"much more reflective Top Gear-related product than usual\\" but commented that \\"Knievel was clearly getting fed up of Hammond and, frankly, I was getting tired of him\\". In contrast to Hammond's conclusion that Knievel was still his hero, the journalist wrote \\"For those of us who didn't play with the wind-up motorbike doll when we were six, [Knievel] didn't seem all that heroic\\". The Observer's Roger Alton describes the show as one of the highlights of the Christmas period when it was first shown, calling it a \\"fantastic achievement\\" and describing it as a \\"stunning, poignant, visually saturated interview\\". Paul Hirons on the TV Scoop website described it as a \\"entertaining and poignant documentary\\" and admired Hammond's \\"refreshingly non-arse-kissy approach to interviewing his hero\\" but described it as \\"a shame\\" that Knievel had not warmed to Hammond. David Belcher's article in The Herald was far more critical describing it as \\"hellish to witness grievous damage being done to the Hamster's cuddly reputation by the ill-advised documentary farrago that was Richard Hammond Meets Evel Knievel.\\" He described Hammond's \\"worship\\" of Knievel as \\"oddly punitive\\" as he \\"pursued the dying man through the streets of his shabby home town, Butte, Montana.\\" =Ratings= The programme finished second in its 9 p.m. timeslot on its first showing in the UK, obtaining 4.4 million viewers which corresponded to an 18% audience share. It beat ITV1's terrestrial premiere of the film Vanity Fair which obtained an audience 2.6 million but was beaten by Monarchy: the Royal Family At Work on sister channel BBC One which drew 5.3 million viewers. The programme was preceded on BBC Two by the last episode of Top Gear's 2007 series (and the evening was promoted as \\"Top Gear Night\\") which had obtained 6.8 million viewers, 2.4 million more than the number that watched Richard Hammond Meets Evel Knievel.

Publication First published in paperback form in 1974 by fiction publisher DAW Books, the then-publisher of Norman's Gor series (and distributed through the same channels as the science-fiction and fantasy paperbacks in DAW's line), the book was then republished in 1997 by Rhinoceros Books, a division of the adult book publishing company Masquerade Books, with a new foreword by noted BDSM author Pat Califia. According to Califia, the original 1974 edition of the book \\"was one of the first above-ground nonfiction books to offer a rationalization for dominant/submissive role-playing and some instructions about how to do it\\". However, the book does not use the terminology which later became common in BDSM circles \\"for the very simple reason that the jargon and conventions we take for granted had not been created when he wrote the book\\". While Norman focuses exclusively on male-dominant heterosexual couples, \\"Imaginative Sex could, however, be used by readers of any sexual orientation or gender\\", according to Califia, since \\"Norman is very good at pinpointing archetypal situations that are ideal for building the tension and polarization crucial to a good scene\\" and \\"It's fairly easy to adapt these scenarios to any S/M or D/S relationship\\".\\"No Fantasy, Please, We're Americans: A Foreword by a Feminist\\", introduction by Pat Califia to the 1997 edition of Imaginative Sex Outline In the book, Norman states that one of his goals as a writer is to allow people's imaginations to become \\"sexually liberated\\". He encourages married couples to use sexual fantasies and role playing in order to enliven their sex lives and explore the mental and spiritual aspects of sexual intercourse. While Norman defends his male dominant/female submissive psychosexual theories (which also underlie the Gor books), it is notable that he does not advise couples to attempt to adopt the customs and institutions of the fictional planet Gor in any literal or simplistic way. Norman places more emphasis on \\"pair-bonding\\" and stable heterosexual relationships than in the Gor books, and when fantasy-scenario whippings are to be enacted, for example, Norman recommends that the man sharply clap his hands together, \\"while the slave reacts as if being whipped\\".

He is the son of Sun Myung Moon, the founder of the Unification Church. He is the founder and owner of Kahr Arms, an American small arms manufacturer and chair of the Sun Moon Education Foundation. Early life Moon is the fourth son of Unification Church leaders Sun Myung Moon and Hak Ja Han. He was born in South Korea, and in 1973 moved to the United States, to Tarrytown, New York, with his family. He attended Hackley School, a small private school in Tarrytown. Moon, who later took the first name Justin, recounts his early interest in firearms: > My first experience shooting was with my older brother when I was 14. He > also liked guns and took me shooting with friends and family. We would have > a great time setting up and shooting targets with an assortment of firearms. > Ever since that first shooting experience, I continued to pursue my interest > in firearms.Massad Ayoob, \\"The Rise of the House of Kahr\\", American > Handgunner (November/December 2001) pp. 58–67. At age 18, Moon got a license to carry a handgun, co-signed by one of his older brothers, but he wasn't satisfied with the small caliber available in a compact handgun. \\"I had been licensed to carry in New York State since I was 18 and had looked for an ultra-compact 9 mm. pistol,\\" Justin later told American Handgunner magazine. \\"To my chagrin, I could not find a pistol with the quality of construction and features in design which I felt were appropriate for a carry gun. Therefore, I decided to design an ultra-compact 9 mm. pistol that I could carry.\\"Quoted in \\"Rev. Moon son made gun\\" Daily News (New York) July 27, 2003. By his junior year of college, he decided to design one himself. \\"I spent the summer and much of my senior year designing the mechanical layout of the pistol and prototyping various design concepts,\\" he told Handgunner. Moon graduated magna cum laude from Harvard with an economics degree in 1992. In graduate school, at University of Miami, he obtained an MBA in 1993. Kahr Arms In 1993, Moon founded Kahr Arms, choosing the name to be suggestive of two of his affections: German engineering and fast cars. “I wanted to create the ultimate line of concealable pistols,” he said.\\"Money, Guns, and God\\" by Christopher S. Stewart, Conde Nast Portfolio, October 2007 Kahr Arms' headquarters is in Greeley, Pennsylvania, and it has a manufacturing facility in Worcester, Massachusetts. It specializes in compact and mid-size semi-automatic pistols chambered for popular cartridges, including .380 ACP, 9 mm Luger Parabellum, .40 S&W; and .45 ACP. Kahr pistols feature polymer or stainless steel frames, single-stack magazines, and double- action striker firing actions. In 1994 the U.S. federal government banned manufacture and importation of pistol magazines with more than a 10-round capacity. These were the so called \\"hi-capacity\\" magazines, which again became legal to manufacture and import in most states in September 2004, after the relevant federal law expired. This change in federal law rendered many staggered-magazine pistol models (commonly with magazine capacities of 15 or more rounds) less popular in the American market. They were now overly large in light of their newly mandated 10-shot limit. Combat Handguns magazine said that Kahr pistols are \\"made like a fine Swiss watch.\\" They are used by some police officers as backup weapons. Tongil Group In 2005 Moon was appointed chairman of Tongil Group, a South Korean business group associated with the Unification Church. As of 2010 he is in the process of reforming its businesses by hiring new managers and by closing unprofitable operations. Among Tongil Group's chief holdings are The Ilwha Company, which produces ginseng and related products; Ilshin Stone, building materials; Tongil Heavy Industries, machine parts including hardware for the South Korean military; and Segye Ilbo, newspaper.

Constance Purdy (August 3, 1887 - April 1, 1960) was an American film actress and classical music performer. Purdy was born in St. Louis, Missouri on August 3, 1887 to American railroad executive Thomas C. Purdy (April 13, 1846; June 17, 1924) and Janet Campbell Purdy (1847; April 10, 1892). As a young girl she reportedly sang for Tsar Nicholas in Russia. At the age of 16 Purdy studied voice in Paris, rooming with future opera diva and film actress Geraldine Farrar, before embarking on a career as a contralto singer, lecturer, and translator of traditional Russian songs. Her friend and personal representative Mabel F. Hammond, often accompanied her on piano. Purdy did not enter into film acting until 1934, with her first appearance, uncredited, being in the film Pursued starring Rosemary Ames. The 1930s saw her in four film appearances, only one of which was credited, that being in the 1935 film Thunder in the Night starring Edmund Lowe and Karen Morley. Most of her film appearances were in the 1940s, playing fifty different roles from 1940 to 1949, of which only six were credited. During the 1950s she had four film appearances, one of which was credited, and one television series appearance. She appeared in a 1951 episode of the TV series The Lone Ranger entitled \\"Trouble at Black Rock.\\" During this period Purdy remained active in music circles, teaming up with Grace Widney Mabee, chair of the National Film Music Council, to launch Film Music Notes, and serving as the journal's co-editor.

In London, his first pumps were powered by an undershot waterwheel housed in the northernmost arches of London Bridge, spanning the tidal River Thames. Early London water supply Until the late 16th century, London citizens were reliant for their water supplies on water from either the River Thames, its tributaries, or one of around a dozen natural springs, including the spring at Tyburn which was connected by lead pipe to a large cistern or tank (then known as a Conduit): the Great Conduit in Cheapside.Water-related Infrastructure in Medieval London, http://www.waterhistory.org/histories/london/ So that water was not removed for unauthorised commercial or industrial purposes, the city authorities appointed keepers of the conduits who would ensure that users such as brewers, cooks and fishmongers would pay for the water they used. Wealthy Londoners living near the a conduit pipe could obtain permission for a connection to their homes, but this did not prevent unauthorised tapping of conduits. Otherwise - particularly for households which could not take a gravity-feed - water from the conduits was provided to individual households by water carriers, or \\"cobs\\", or was taken directly from the Thames or from its tributary streams. The Morice Waterwheels In 1580, Morice applied to city officials for permission to construct a waterwheel and pumps - also known as a forcier - under an arch of London Bridge to supply culinary water to the city. After an impressive demonstration of the power of his pump (he forced a jet of water over the spire of the Church of St Magnus near London Bridge), he was granted a 500-year lease, at an annual rent of just 10 shillings,Shelton Kirby, Richard, Engineering in History on one arch, despite opposition from the city's water carriers. This lease was later (c.1584 and 1701) extended to include additional arches. Initially, water was lifted to the conduit house in Leadenhall, but was later extended to other areas of the city. Waterwheels were also constructed under London Bridge to grind corn. Morice's waterwheels and associated machinery were destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666 (no description remains), but replacements engineered by his grandson remained under the bridge until the early 19th century. In 1731, a description of the machinery was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. The three waterwheels worked a total of 52 water pumps; the wheels could turn in either direction and so be driven by the flowing and ebbing tide; and the pumps were designed to force 132,120 gallons an hour to a height of 120 feet. \\"These water-works, a cumbrous-looking structure of wood, stood on the Middlesex side of the Thames, adjoining the bridge, and near the site of Fishmongers' Hall steam-boat pier.\\"'Southwark: Old St Thomas's and Guy's Hospitals', Old and New London: Volume 6 (1878), pp. 89-100.

Date accessed: 26 December 2007 However, the London Bridge Waterworks alone could not supply the growing City of London with all its water supply, and while it continued in use until 1822, its importance soon dwindled in comparison with Sir Hugh Myddleton's New River water supply project. The waterworks was eventually demolished in 1822, being taken over by the New River Company,Jenkins, Rhys (1936) Links in the History of Engineering and Technology from Tudor Times, Chapter XVII: Notes on the London Bridge Waterworks to allow the construction of the New London Bridge. Just prior to the demolition, the waterworks, supplied 10,417 houses with 26,322,705 hogsheads per annum, at a rental cost of £12,266.

He became involved with the group and succeeded Ripoche as leader after the latter's arrest in March 1943. Under Coquoin's command, the CDLL expanded to Paris and the rest of France, gathering new volunteers in Normandy, Champagne, Bourgogne and Vendée. Coquoin also made contact with other resistance movements in the occupied zone and even in the southern zone of Vichy. His capabilities in chemistry enabled him to develop detonators and abrasive pellets for destroying German trucks. After Coquoin was killed in an ambush in December 1943, Gilbert Védy, CDLL's delegate to the Assemblée consultative provisoire in Algiers, returned to Paris to head the movement. However, three days after his arrival, on 21 March 1944, Védy was arrested and poisoned himself during the interrogation rather than risk divulging any information.

Granville (September 25, 1974 – January 1, 2008) was an American diplomat who worked in South Sudan. On January 1, 2008, he was assassinated in a shooting in Khartoum, Sudan. Career Granville grew up in Buffalo, New York. He was a graduate of Canisius High School in 1993 and of Fordham University. In 2003, he graduated from Clark University with a Master of Arts degree in International Development and Social Change. He studied as a Fulbright Fellow in Africa. After school, Granville joined the Peace Corps and was sent to Cameroon for two years. As a diplomat, Granville worked for the United States Agency for International Development in Kenya and Sudan. In his last assignment, he led a project to provide residents in South Sudan with 75,000 radios that could be powered by a crank generator or solar panels. The project was part of the preparations for the upcoming 2009 elections in South Sudan. \\"He told his mom several times ... that it's dangerous, what he's doing, but he wouldn't want to be doing anything else,\\" said U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins, who spoke with Granville's mother, Jane Granville, after her son's death.  Attack  On January 1, 2008, Granville was attacked by gunmen while being driven home from a New Year's Eve party at the British Embassy in Khartoum. According to Sudanese officials, Granville was ambushed by two gunmen who stopped their car in front of his. His driver, Abdel Rahman Abbas, was killed immediately. Another gunman shot Granville in the neck and chest. He died a few hours later, after being taken to a hospital. Ali Sadiq, a spokesman for Sudan's Foreign Ministry, has stated, \\"We do not know why this happened. All options are possible.\\" However, other Sudanese officials stated that gun crime is unusual in Khartoum. The United States State Department refused to comment because their investigation was in progress. The attack followed a warning by the United Nations that a terrorist cell in Sudan was planning to attack foreigners. Investigations Both the US and the Sudanese government have announced investigations as to the causes of the shooting and efforts to find the perpetrators. The US effort will consist of a joint State Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation team. Four days after the murders, a previously unknown militant group, Ansar al-Tawhid (Companions of Monotheism) claimed responsibility via a post on a website used by Islamists. In September, five Sudanese men admitted their roles in the shooting in filmed confessions. On June 24, 2009 four men were sentenced to death by hanging for the killing. A fifth man received a two-year prison term for providing the weapon used in the attack. The convicts were identified as Abdelraouf Abu Zaid Mohamed Hamza, Mohamed Makawi Ibrahim Mohamed, Abdelbasit Alhaj Alhasan Haj Ahmad, and Mohanad Osman Yousif Mohamed. In June 2010, the four men broke out of prison, killing a police officer and wounding another during their escape. Sudanese authorities then issued a global Interpol warrant for their arrest. One was recaptured three weeks later. Another was killed in Somalia in May 2011.United States Department of State Memorials Granville's family in Buffalo said he was committed to his work in Africa. \\"John's life was a celebration of love, hope and peace,\\" a family statement said. \\"He will be missed by many people throughout the world whose lives were touched and made better because of his care.\\" On January 29, 2008, City Honors School in Buffalo awarded John Granville their annual Keeping The Dream Alive award, honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. On May 2, 2008, John Negroponte, Deputy Secretary of State, addressed the American Foreign Service Association's memorial plaque ceremony in which he and others honored John Granville.United States Department of State Remarks From The American Foreign Service Association's Memorial Plaque Ceremony See also * United States Agency for International Development (USAID) * Elections in Sudan * 1973 Khartoum diplomatic assassinations References ;Notes ;Sources * *  External links  Category:1974 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Assassinated American diplomats Category:American diplomats Category:2000s murders in Sudan Category:2008 crimes in Sudan Category:2008 murders in Africa Category:Clark University alumni Category:Fordham University alumni Category:People from Buffalo, New York Category:Peace Corps volunteers Category:Khartoum Category:American terrorism victims Category:Terrorism deaths in Sudan Category:American people murdered abroad Category:People murdered in Sudan Category:Deaths by firearm in Sudan Category:Fulbright Scholars Category:People of the United States Agency for International Development ","title":"John Granville (diplomat)"},{"id":"14994746","text":"Richard Forlani Neely (born August 2, 1941) is a former justice and chief justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals from 1973 to 1995. When he took office, he became the youngest judge of a court of last resort in the English-speaking world in the 20th century. Early life and education Neely graduated in 1964 from Dartmouth College, in economics. In 1967 he graduated from Yale Law School. From 1968 to 1969, Neely served as an army artillery captain in Vietnam, where he was assigned to the staff of John Paul Vann and then to the staff of Ambassador Charles S. Whitehouse. Among other duties, Neely supervised the economic development program for a quarter of South Vietnam and then wrote the economic development section of the 1969 American pacification plan. He was awarded the Bronze Star. He is the grandson of Matthew M. Neely, who served as Governor of West Virginia and later as U.S. Senator.  Legal career  Upon returning to civilian life, Neely started his own law practice in Fairmont, West Virginia and in 1970 was elected to the West Virginia Legislature. Thereafter, he was elected state-wide as a Democrat to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. As a supreme court justice, Neely led reform of the State mental hospitals and juvenile penal schools. Decisions written by him extended greater protections to mental patients, and wiped out the old, brutal state reform school system for both boys and girls, forcing the substitution of real therapeutic models. Neely is known for his pioneering work in domestic law. Decisions he wrote for the Court, along with his books and articles, created the foundation for the child custody sections of the American Law Institute's Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution. From 1980 until his retirement from the Court in 1995, Neely was among the best known judges in the United States: he wrote regularly for national publications such as The Atlantic Monthly, The New Republic, and The Wall Street Journal. Neely's scholarly work usually involved the sociology of courts. His oft-reprinted cover article for the August 1982 Atlantic Monthly, \\"The Politics of Crime\\", explained, for example, that criminal courts are more incompetent than they should be because criminal judges are also civil judges and civil defendants, like insurance companies, actively lobby to keep courts as incompetent as possible to make it harder for civil plaintiffs to sue them. Neely's best-known book, How Courts Govern America was written at the height of judicial activism. Frankly admitting that he was a restrained judicial activist, Neely explained the practical and political limits to courts' powers, making his book an important contribution to arguments for judicial restraint. The book remains in print. Neely always maintained an active interest in teaching: He was one of the first American professors to teach law in China in 1984 when China opened up; he served as Atherton Lecturer at Harvard; and, for over a decade he was professor of economics at the University of Charleston. On April 15, 1995, Neely retired from the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals and returned to private practice, starting the firm of Neely & Hunter (now Neely & Callaghan) in Charleston, West Virginia. =Controversies= In 1985 while serving a rotation as Chief Justice, Neely dismissed his secretary, Tess Dineen from her job because she wanted to stop baby-sitting his 4-year-old son. While Neely defended his right to order his staff to perform duties such as baby-sitting, collecting his laundry, and typing books he has written, he stepped down as Chief Justice before his rotation ended.https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/29/us/around-the- nation-judge-bows-to-pressure-on-baby-sitting-demand.html In 1989 he sued Trans World Airlines for $38,000 after his baggage arrived 70 minutes late at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Neely had flown from Seattle, Washington, to New York to appear on a television program, 20/20. In his suit, he sought $3,000 from TWA as a speaker's fee because he informed fellow passengers about the delay.http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Judge- Sues-Airline-Over-Luggage-Delay/id-119f6e569ea603564dcce49547004c4f He settled out of court for $12,500.http://www.neelycallaghan.com/press/r/1990_02_12_NEELY_SETTLES_LAWSUIT.pdf Neely received national attention for controversial remarks at American Legion youth leadership conferences. In 1989 he told the conference > \\"It's time for citizens like you and me to go home and get our baseball > bats\\" to attack drug dealers. In 1990 Neely told the all-male conference that society would be better off if women stayed home with their children. He said drinking, womanizing and fighting in wars are all right until men have a family. At the same conference he stated that he \\"wouldn't work within 500 yards of a person with the AIDS virus.\\" Bibliography Neely's other major publications include: *\\"Why Wage-Price Guidelines Failed: A General Theory of the Second Best Approach to Inflation Control\\", 79 W.

Originally, the district covered only Danville, but it was granted an increasing geographical region as the state decommissioned surrounding districts. It expanded to cover all but the very northernmost townships of Montour County. Later, with the decommission and annexation of South Danville School District, it took up part of Northumberland County as well. In 1957, Danville School District was awarded the designation of \\"Area\\" in its name.

He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full-day kindergarten would be recouped by districts in lower special education costs. Danville Area School District has seen a slight decrease in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding minimal budget savings. The district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815 for special education services. This funding was in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or declining local tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30.

Definition  Abstractly, given a ring A , the Steinberg group \\\\operatorname{St}(A) is the universal central extension of the commutator subgroup of the stable general linear group (the commutator subgroup is perfect and so has a universal central extension). = Presentation using generators and relations = A concrete presentation using generators and relations is as follows. Elementary matrices — i.e. matrices of the form {e_{pq}}(\\\\lambda) := \\\\mathbf{1} + {a_{pq}}(\\\\lambda) , where \\\\mathbf{1} is the identity matrix, {a_{pq}}(\\\\lambda) is the matrix with \\\\lambda in the (p,q) -entry and zeros elsewhere, and p eq q — satisfy the following relations, called the Steinberg relations: : \\\\begin{align} e_{ij}(\\\\lambda) e_{ij}(\\\\mu) & = e_{ij}(\\\\lambda+\\\\mu); &&  \\\\left[ e_{ij}(\\\\lambda),e_{jk}(\\\\mu) \\\\right] & = e_{ik}(\\\\lambda \\\\mu), && \\\\text{for } i eq k;  \\\\left[ e_{ij}(\\\\lambda),e_{kl}(\\\\mu) \\\\right] & = \\\\mathbf{1}, && \\\\text{for } i eq l \\\\text{ and } j eq k. \\\\end{align} The unstable Steinberg group of order r over A , denoted by {\\\\operatorname{St}_{r}}(A) , is defined by the generators {x_{ij}}(\\\\lambda) , where 1 \\\\leq i eq j \\\\leq r and \\\\lambda \\\\in A , these generators being subject to the Steinberg relations. The stable Steinberg group, denoted by \\\\operatorname{St}(A) , is the direct limit of the system {\\\\operatorname{St}_{r}}(A) \\\\to {\\\\operatorname{St}_{r + 1}}(A) .

Mapping {x_{ij}}(\\\\lambda) \\\\mapsto {e_{ij}}(\\\\lambda) yields a group homomorphism \\\\varphi: \\\\operatorname{St}(A) \\\\to {\\\\operatorname{GL}_{\\\\infty}}(A) . As the elementary matrices generate the commutator subgroup, this mapping is surjective onto the commutator subgroup. = Interpretation as a fundamental group = The Steinberg group is the fundamental group of the Volodin space, which is the union of classifying spaces of the unipotent subgroups of GL(A).  Relation to K-theory  = K1 = {K_{1}}(A) is the cokernel of the map \\\\varphi: \\\\operatorname{St}(A) \\\\to {\\\\operatorname{GL}_{\\\\infty}}(A) , as K_{1} is the abelianization of {\\\\operatorname{GL}_{\\\\infty}}(A) and the mapping \\\\varphi is surjective onto the commutator subgroup. = K2 = {K_{2}}(A) is the center of the Steinberg group. This was Milnor's definition, and it also follows from more general definitions of higher K -groups. It is also the kernel of the mapping \\\\varphi: \\\\operatorname{St}(A) \\\\to {\\\\operatorname{GL}_{\\\\infty}}(A) . Indeed, there is an exact sequence : 1 \\\\to {K_{2}}(A) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{St}(A) \\\\to {\\\\operatorname{GL}_{\\\\infty}}(A) \\\\to {K_{1}}(A) \\\\to 1.

On the region's of vineyards in 2008, white wine grapes dominate with 75% and Riesling is the most common variety with 27.2%.German Wine Institute: German wine statistics 2009/2010 A characteristic of the Nahe region is that the soils are very varied owing to the region's volcanic origins. Although the region was populated already in Roman times, and the village of Monzingen was mentioned as a wine village as early as 778,Jancis Robinson (ed), \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\", Third Edition, p 468-469, Oxford University Press 2006, the Nahe wine region was defined only with the 1971 German wine law. Before that, the wines were sold as plain \\"Rhine wine\\". In recent decades, several Nahe producers have made a name for themselves with Riesling wines that have been rated very highly by international wine critics, and have come to be seen as being on par with the best wines of Moselle and Rheingau wines. History Old Nahe Bridge in Bad Kreuznach, 1900. The Nahe was one of the last few German wine regions to develop significant plantings, being planted nearly six centuries after the Romans first cultivated the Mosel region. By the Middle Ages, viticulture was flourishing in the region under the care of Church-run vineyards. During the 19th century, the Nahe was considered one of Germany's finest wine regions and continued its prosperity till experiencing economic downturns following the world wars of the 20th century. While other German wine regions became more industrialized, the more rural Nahe fell behind and its presence on the world's wine market was dramatically reduced. Towards the end of the 20th century, reforms and renewed optimism among the Nahe winemakers would usher in a period of renaissance in the Nahe wine industry.T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pg 362-363 Dorling Kindersley 2005 Climate and geography The Nahe wine region follows the path of the Nahe river in its northeasterly descent towards the Rhine. The river helps moderate the temperate climate of the region and the valleys of the Nahe's tributaries help foster diverse microclimates through the region. The Soonwald ranges to the northeast and rocky foothills to the east help retain heat and moderate the amount of rainfall that the region receives. Some south-facing vineyards have microclimates that are similar to a Mediterranean climate and are being experimented with for red wine grape cultivation. The Nahe flows parallel to the Moselle and lies to the southeast of the Mosel wine region. The Mittelrhein and Rheingau wine regions lie to the north/northeast with the Rheinhessen forming the region's eastern border. Vineyards are located on steep slopes along the Nahe and its tributaries typically at elevations of 100–300 meters (330–985 ft). Subregions Nahe wine regions The majority of the vineyards in the Nahe wine region are found along the banks of the Nahe from Martinstein, near the historic village of Monzingen and then downstream to its confluence with the Rhine at Bingen am Rhein. The region is broadly divided into three subregions, though there are quality wines that carry the \\"Nahe\\" designation that are produced outside of these. The main regions are the Upper Nahe, Bad Kreuznach and Lower Nahe. The wine-producing areas outside of these subregions includes the river Alsenz area that meets the Nahe at Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg and the villages of Bockenau, Roxheim, Sommerloch and Wallhausen several miles northwest of the Nahe. The Nahe formally has only one overlapping district Bereich Nahetal that includes 7 Grosslagen (collective sites) and 328 Einzellagen (vineyards). The 7 Grosslagen are: *Grosslage Burgweg-on the Upper Nahe, shares a name with Grosslagen in the Rheingau and Franconia. Most noted for its Riesling wine production. *Grosslage Paradiesgarten-on the Upper Nahe, includes the historic village of Monzingen. Some producers here are noted for their Rieslings of cult wine status. *Grosslage Kronenberg-in the Bad Kreuznach region, considered one of the best quality Grosslagen in the Nahe. *Grosslage Pfarrgaten-northwest of Bad Kreuznach around the village of Wallhausen, one of the Nahe's smallest Grosslagen. *Grosslage Rosengarten-northwest of Bad Kreuznach, shares a name with a Grosslage in the Rheingau; the region is widely planted with Müller- Thurgau and Silvaner. *Grosslage Schlosskapelle-on the Lower Nahe, one of the Nahe's most promising Grosslagen for Pinot blanc and Pinot gris. *Grosslage Sonnenborn-on the Lower Nahe and centered on the village of Langenlonsheim. =Upper Nahe= Porphyry cobblestones The Upper Nahe region includes the westernmost and oldest vineyards on the Nahe. The region begins with the villages of Martinstein, Monzingen and follows the river to Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg where it meets the Alsenz. The area is noted for its vast diversity of vineyard soils, particularly in the area near Oberhausen where a single vineyard can include soils of sandstone, slate, melaphyre and porphyry. This region of the Nahe was modernized during the Flurbereinigung reforms of the late 20th century and is now characterized by steep, terraced vineyards along the banks of the Nahe planted mostly with Riesling. The climate of the region gets progressively warmer downstream with low amounts of annual rainfall that is favorable for the production of late harvest wines. Wine villages of the Upper Nahe include-(moving downstream) *Monzingen-including the Frühlingsplätzchen and Halenberg vineyards *Meddersheim-including the Rheingrafenberg vineyard *Schlossböckelheim-including the Felsenberg and Kupfergrube vineyards *Oberhausen-including the Brücke vineyard *Niederhausen- including the Hermannshöhle and Kerz vineyard. A 1901 classification of Nahe's vineyard carried out by the office of the Royal Prussian Surveyor listed the Hermannshöhle vineyard as the highest-ranking vineyard on the Nahe.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 224-225 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 *Norheim-including the Dellchen and Kirschheck vineyards *Traisen- including the Bastei and Rotenfels vineyards =Bad Kreuznach= The subregion of Bad Kreuznach includes the vineyards north of the town that are dominated with clay- and loess-based soils. The area has been traditionally led by large family-owned estates, such as those of the Anheuser family (of which the brewer Eberhard Anheuser was a part) and the Reichsgrafen von Plettenberg who are still producing wine today. These families were instrumental in the years after World War II in sustaining the reputation of Nahe wine but the Bad Kreuznach region, as a whole, has seen a steady decline since the end of the 20th century with very few vineyards participating in the VDP (Verband Deutscher Prädikats- und Qualitätsweingüter) organization. The region still has some quality vineyards with the Kahlenberg and Krötenpfuhl being the most significant. =Lower Nahe= Riesling The Lower Nahe subregion follows the Nahe past Bad Kreuznach north to the river's confluence with the Rhine at Bingen. Vineyards in the area tend to be quartzite and slate. In addition to Riesling, Scheurebe, Silvaner and Pinot blanc all have significant plantings in this area. The wines of the Lower Nahe tend to have more similarities to the wines of the Mittelrhein rather than the wines from other parts of the Nahe. This includes characteristic flavors of wet stones and minerals with citrus and stone fruit notes. Wine villages of the Lower Nahe include-moving north *Dorsheim-including the vineyards of Troll-Bach, Burgberg, Goldloch and Pittermännchen *Münster-Sarmsheim-including the vineyards of Dautenflänzer and Pittersberg *Laubenheim-including the vineyard of St. Remigiusberg *Windesheim-including the vineyard of Rosenberg Grapes and wine Ahr wines at Bad Kreuznach. The Nahe is a predominantly white wine region with Riesling being the most significant planting. Riesling's prominence is due in part to the reforms of the Flurbereinigung and the decline of Müller-Thurgau which was once the Nahe's most widely planted variety but now accounts for around 16% of plantings. In the 1960s, Silvaner occupied more than half of all vineyards on the Nahe but fell in favor to plantings of Müller-Thurgau and Riesling such that it now accounts for a little less than 10%. Plantings of Pinot blanc, Pinot gris and the red Pinot noir have been increasing. Overall, red grape varieties account for around 23% of the Nahe's vineyards with Dornfelder, Blauer Portugieser and Pinot noir being the most popular plantings. Other varieties found in the Nahe include Bacchus, Faberrebe and Kerner. For a large part of the Nahe's history, grapes from the region were blended with other German wine grapes and labeled as \\"Rhine wine\\". Today the majority of Nahe wine is consumed domestically with the nine member estates of the VDP having the largest export market of the region. Unlike other German wine regions, co-operatives have a smaller presence that pales in comparison to the influences of the large German supermarket chains that form a large sector of the Nahe wine market.

In 1934 she would again have the lead starring roles in all of her films, first in I Believed in You, followed by Such Women Are Dangerous and Pursued. Her first premier role was alongside Janet Gaynor and Warner Baxter in the 1935 film One More Spring. She followed that starring opposite Edmund Lowe and Victor McLaglen in The Great Hotel Murder, and opposite Shirley Temple and Joel McCrea in Our Little Girl that same year.

Most developed countries do not allow a deduction for interest on personal loans, so countries that allow a home mortgage interest deduction have created an exception to those rules. The Netherlands, Switzerland, the United States, Belgium, Denmark, and Ireland allow some form of the deduction.  Status in countries  = Canada = Canadian federal income tax does not allow a deduction from taxable income for interest on loans secured by the taxpayer's personal residence, but homes used in businesses as a landlord who owns a rental residential property can deduct interest as any other reasonable business expense. The difference being the deduction is allowed only when the property is not used for the taxpayer's personal use but is used as in any other type of business.https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tax-resources/tax- deductions/is-interest-deductible.jsp However, there may be additional exclusions for passive activity losses. An indirect method, known as the Smith Manoeuvre, for making interest on mortgage for personal residence tax deductible in Canada is through an asset swap, whereby the homebuyer sells his existing investments, purchases a house in full or in part by the sale, gets a mortgage on the house, and finally, buys back his investments with the money from the mortgage.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/mortgages-and- rates/the-smith-maneuver-a-canadian-mortgage-tax-deductible- plan/article12059456/ The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled in 2001 in the Singleton v. Canada case that transactions in the asset swap are to be regarded as distinct, thus rendering the interest on home mortgage acquired as part of the asset swap tax deductible. The home ownership rate in Canada was about the same as in the United States in 2008Worthwhile Canadian Initiative despite the difference in tax policy. = Denmark = In Denmark part of the interest is deductible. In 1987 it was 73%. In 1993 it was 50% and in 1998 it was 46%. From 1998 to 2001 it was reduced to 32%. It is the plan that in 2019 it will be 25.5%. = France = France does not allow a home mortgage interest deduction. In 2007, newly elected President Nicolas Sarkozy proposed creating the deduction as part of his legislative plan for sparking the French economy. In August 2007, the Constitutional Council, the highest court in France, struck down the mortgage interest deduction as unconstitutionally creating a tax advantage that goes far beyond its stated goal of encouraging non-homeowners to buy homes. The Court noted that the deduction would apply to people who already own homes.http://www.conseil- constitutionnel.fr/decision/2007/2007555/2007555dc.htm (French) = India = Home loan interest portion is deductible (under section 24(b)) up to 150 000 rupees in a tax year for acquiring or constructing a property. The deduction is available only when the construction is complete or you have possession of the property. Interest of pre-construction period is deductible in five equal installments. The first installment is deductible in the year in which construction of property is completed or property acquired. The principal is deductible under section 80C, which has a limit of 150 000 rupees., Benefits of Home Loan Tax Exemptionhttp://mytaxes.in/index.php?topic=9.0 Home Loan Deduction = Netherlands = In the Netherlands, a part of the interest payments can be deducted for a maximum period of 30 years. The deduction percentage is based on a person's income.http://www.belastingdienst.nl/variabel/buitenland/en/private_taxpayers/private_taxpayers-12.html However, before deduction the taxable income is increased by a percentage of the property value (so-called \\"notional rental value\\"http://www.belastingdienst.nl/variabel/buitenland/en/private_taxpayers/private_taxpayers-10.html , ) with the reasoning that the property has a potential income-generating purpose. Still in place currently, the mortgage interest tax deduction is subject to fierce debate, and a political issue during most recent elections. Although largely an emotional point of discussion with the Dutch electorate, and described by many as \\"political suicide\\", most Dutch people believe that the mortgage interest tax deduction will eventually be reformed. Many reasons for abolishment have been identified, often fuelled by a political ideology (e.g. creating house price inflation, limiting government earnings in times of economic downturn, mortgage interest tax deduction is increasing already high tax levels in the Netherlands, benefiting high income individuals more disproportionally).:nl:Hypotheekrenteaftrek As it stands now, Dutch politicians and other organisations research possible strategies to end interest payments tax deduction and are fuelling public debate to prepare the Dutch public for eventual abolishment.http://www.tns-nipo.com/pages/nieuws- pers-vnipo.asp?file=persvannipo\\\\pol_woningmarkt-08062010.htm Only 18% of the Dutch public support eliminating the mortgage interest deduction entirely. = Norway = Norway considers any interest paid, whether it is for a home mortgage or other debt, as a deductible expense. The result is a reduction of the tax bill of 25% of all interest paid. The fact that the government in effect subsidises 25% of the interest bill has made home ownership highly beneficial in Norway, and critics argue that the deduction has increased the cost of real estate. The Center Party has proposed reducing the deduction. = Sweden = A tax credit of 30% of interest up until 100,000 SEK, and 21% over that amount.https://www.skatteverket.se/privat/skatter/arbeteinkomst/avdragslexikon/r.4.5fc8c94513259a4ba1d800042806.html The amount was about 10,000 SEK per taxpaying person with debts. = United Kingdom = The United Kingdom introduced a scheme called MIRAS in 1983 to allow mortgage interest to be tax deductible. It was abolished in 2000. = United States = Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86), the interest on all personal loans (including credit card debt) was deductible. TRA86 eliminated that broad deduction, but left the narrower home mortgage interest deduction. While some Americans may believe that Congress created the home mortgage interest deduction as a way to encourage home ownership, historians point out that this was never the case, as explained in a New York Times article that notes that, in 1913, when interest deductions started, Congress \\"certainly wasn't thinking of the interest deduction as a stepping-stone to middle-class home ownership, because the tax excluded the first $3,000 (or for married couples, $4,000) of income; less than 1 percent of the population earned more than that;\\" moreover, during that era, most people who purchased homes paid upfront rather than taking out a mortgage. Rather, the reason for the deduction was that in a nation of small proprietors, it was more difficult to separate business and personal expenses, and so it was simpler to just allow deduction of all interest. Under of the Internal Revenue Code, the United States allows a home mortgage interest deduction, with several limitations. First, the taxpayer must elect to itemize deductions, and the total itemized deductions must exceed the standard deduction (otherwise, itemization would not reduce tax). Second, the deduction is limited to interest on debts secured by a principal residence or a second home. Third, interest is deductible on only the first $1 million of debt used for acquiring, constructing, or substantially improving the residence, ($500,000 if filing separately) or the first $100,000 of home equity debt regardless of the purpose or use of the loan. The cost to the federal government of the mortgage interest deductions in 2018 was approximately $25 billion, down from $60 billion for 2017 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In the United States, there are additional tax incentives for home ownership. For example, taxpayers are allowed an exclusion of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of capital gains on the sale of real property if the owner used it as primary residence for two of the five years before the date of sale. Economists have demonstrated that high-cost high-income areas receive most of the tax benefit. For example, San Francisco, California receives $26,385 per home while El Paso, Texas receives $2,153 per home, a 1,225% difference.See Table 4 in The five highest income metros receive 87% of tax inflows, with over half going into California alone.  Controversy  The standard justification for the deduction is that it gives an incentive for home ownership, but most economists believe the deduction is bad policy and is counterproductive. They note that it increases inequality, is an unnecessary market distortion, and contributes to housing unaffordability. The National Association of Realtors strongly opposes eliminating the mortgage interest deduction, claiming, \\"Housing is the engine that drives the economy, and to even mention reducing the tax benefits of home ownership could endanger property values. Home prices, particularly in high cost areas, could decline 15 percent if recommendations to convert the mortgage interest deduction to a tax credit are implemented.\\" The Tax Foundation argues that few low- and middle-income taxpayers benefit,Who Benefits from the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction? calling it a subsidy for the real estate industry. Alan Mallach, a senior fellow at the Center for Community Progress and a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, argues that the deduction artificially inflates home prices. Critics in the United States also estimate that it contributes between $70 billion and $100 billion annually to the federal budget deficit. Economist Edward Glaeser remarked in The New York Times that the policy \\"is public paternalism at its worst\\" and wrongfully \\"encourages people to leave urban areas\\" as well as to borrow as much as possible to bet on housing. On 9 March 2012, PBS aired an episode of its show Need to Know in which a bipartisan panel discussed tax reform. The panel, which consisted of former Democratic politician Eliot Spitzer, tax law professor Dorothy A. Brown, Reagan domestic policy advisor Bruce Bartlett, and libertarian economist Daniel J. Mitchell, unanimously opposed the federal mortgage interest deduction.

After rebuilding fortresses that had been destroyed by the Mongols and establishing his authority over the outer towns of the province, he left his brother Mubaraz al-Din Abu'l-Fath in charge of Sistan and traveled to the ordo of Ögedei Khan. There Shams al-Din was confirmed as the khan's vassal; he was obliged to pay Mongol taxes and to destroy a stronghold in the district of Farah. In 1253 the town of Nih in western Sistan was besieged by the Mongol commander Neguder. Shams al-Din led an army in support of Nih and forced Negüder to negotiate for peace in Shahr-i Sistan. He also spent a year campaigning in northern Baluchistan. In 1255, however, a rebellion in the capital broke out, a problem which became more serious when the Kartid malik of Herat, Shams ud-Din, marched south and seized Shahr-i Sistan. When Shams al-Din left the safety of his palace, he was killed by the rebels.

He was brought to Istanbul after being recruited by the Ottoman scouts in Rumelia, educated, served several Ottoman sultans, and became a teacher at Enderun School. Life Matrakçı Nasuh (bin Abdullah; son of Abdullah), born in the Bosnian town of Visoko, was a gifted Janissary who went through both the Infantry and devşirme system, a gifted swordsman, and sharpshooter well known for his intellect; he spoke five languages and was recruited into the Ottoman Navy. Although born to Bosnian Muslim parentage, Nasuh was drafted into the devşirme system, otherwise reserved for the Christian populace of the empire. Exceptionally, however, in Bosnia, the devşirme was also extended to local Muslim families.The Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age 1300–1600, Halil Inalcik, (1973), p. 78.The Balkans since 1453, L.S. Stavrianos, (New York, 1958), p. 84. After a long period of studies on mathematics and geometry, he wrote his works Cemâlü'l-Küttâb and Kemalü'l- Hisâb and submitted them to the Ottoman sultan Selim I. He wrote also the two books named Mecmaü't-Tevârih and Süleymannâme. They deal with the history of the period of 1520–43. He also wrote a historical piece on the Persian campaign of Suleiman I titled Fetihname-i Karabuğdan. A recent study of his book Umdet-ul Hisab revealed an unknown fact that Matrakçı had invented some genuine multiplication methods. One of the significant results displayed in this book was that the lattice method had been widely used in the Enderun School nearly 50 years before John Napier reintroduced it to Europe. Besides his works on mathematics and history, he is famous because of his miniatures. He created a naturalist style which focuses on panoramic views of landscapes and cities painted with the greatest detail (his most famous work, the Istanbul landscape picture, shows almost every street and building of the city). In Ottoman miniature art, this was later known as the \\"Matrakçı style\\". The most important of his four historic volumes of miniatures is the one dealing with Suleiman I's Safavid war, upon which he had written his historical work Fetihname-i Karabuğdan. Besides illustrating the march of the Ottoman army from Istanbul to Baghdad and then Tabriz and its return via Halab and Eskisehir, Nasuh also includes all the cities met by the army along the way. The Library of Istanbul University hosts the only copy of this work. Nasuh was also a soldier and a master bladesmith. He worked as a weapons teacher at Enderun School. He and his students demonstrated their skills in a show which was part of the circumcision celebrations of Suleiman I's sons. Because of his success in this demonstration, Nasuh received the honorary title of Ustad (\\"master\\") and Reis (\\"chief\\") from the Sultan. He also wrote a book about usage of various weapons and techniques of cavalry and infantry fight, called Tuhfet-ül Guzât.

The majority are dark in color and range in size from approximately 1.5 to 5.0 mm. Most specimens have been collected in arid climates, but one species from Madagascar is known to occur in a humid forest habitat. Although males have functional wings, heterogynaid females are typically brachypterous, a trait which is unique among spheciform wasps. Wing venation is reduced in both sexes. All species are diurnal, with the exception of H. nocticola. Other aspects of their biology are completely unknown, but details of their morphology have prompted researchers to hypothesize that they may be non-fossorial parasitoids adapted to hunt in tight spaces, such as under tree bark. This is speculative and has not yet been confirmed by actual observations of behavior. It is also possible that modifications of the female metasomal tergum VI and gonostyli may represent a unique prey transport mechanism, but this is also unconfirmed. The Heterogynaidae were historically considered the sister taxon to the remainder of the Apoidea, but recent studies utilizing molecular characters do not support this hypothesis. While monophyly of the genus is strongly supported, it is now considered to be related to the Crabronidae or, most recently, a lineage within the Bembicidae.Manuela Sann, Oliver Niehuis, Ralph S.

Such animals or their wings may be described as \\"brachypterous\\". Brachypterous wings generally are not functional as organs of flight and often seem to be totally functionless and vestigial. In some species however, wings that are vestigial in the sense of not retaining any function related to flight, may have other functions, such as organs of aposematic display in some Orthoptera and Phasmatodea. Brachyptery occurs commonly among insects. An insect species might evolve towards brachyptery in reducing its flight muscles with their associated energy demands, or in avoiding the hazards of flight in windy conditions on oceanic islands, in which flying insects are prone to drowning. Brachyptery also is common in ectoparasitic insects that have no use for wings, and inquiline insects with socially parasitic life strategies that do not require functional wings. In some species of insects, brachyptery occurs in some members (say in only one sex, or only some castes), whereas fully functional wings occur in macropterous individuals. Other forms of brachyptery may depend on the temperature at which the insect grew and developed. In winter for example, some species grow reduced wings, whereas in summer they grow fully developed wings that are adequate for migration. The extreme form of brachyptery, in which no wings grow at all, such as in fleas or worker ants is called aptery.

Education and career Rubadiri attended King's College, Budo, in Uganda from 1941 to 1950, then Makerere University in Kampala (1952–56), where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in English literature and History. He later studied Literature at King’s College, Cambridge. He went on to receive a Diploma in Education from the University of Bristol. At Malawi's independence in 1964, Rubadiri was appointed Malawi's first ambassador to the United States and the United Nations. When he presented his credentials to President Lyndon B. Johnson at the White House on 18 August 1964, he expressed the hope that his newly independent country would get more aid from the USA; he said that Malawi needed help to build its democratic institutions and noted that Malawi was already receiving US economic and technical help.Nyasaland Times, Tuesday, 18 August 1964.

Yang was criticized by traditional historians for his flattery.  Background  It is not known when Yang Zaisi was born, but it is known that his family was from Zheng Prefecture (鄭州, roughly modern Zhengzhou, Henan). He passed the imperial examination when he was young, and was made the sheriff of Xuanwu County (玄武, in modern Deyang, Sichuan). On one occasion, when he was in the capital Chang'an on official business and staying at an inn, there was a thief who stole his baggage. As the thief was leaving, Yang happened to encounter him, and the thief begged for forgiveness. He told the thief, \\"You, sir, must be committing this crime only out of poverty. Please go and not make a sound, as to not alert anyone else. Just leave me my official papers; the money you can have.\\" The thief left, and Yang borrowed money for the remainder of his trip. He was eventually promoted to serve as a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs, and then as imperial censor.  During Wu Zetian's reign  In 694, Yang Zaisi was still serving as censor when he was made Luantai Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (鸞臺, Luantai), and was given the designation of Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto. In 697, during a rebellion by Khitan's khan Sun Wanrong, Eastern Tujue's khan Ashina Mochuo, who had been at times ally and at times enemy of Wu Zetian's Zhou Dynasty, indicated that he was willing to be aligned with Zhou against Khitan and made a number of requests for return of Tujue people who had surrendered to Zhou, various treasures, and food supplies, which, after Yang and fellow chancellor Yao Shu argued were necessary to maintain an alliance with Eastern Tujue, Wu Zetian agreed to give Ashina Mochuo, allowing him to become even stronger than before. In 699, Yang was removed from his posts and made imperial censor reviewing central government affairs (左臺大夫, Zuotai Daifu), no longer chancellor. In 704, troubled by the fact that prefectural prefects were not performing well, Wu Zetian asked the chancellors for suggestions. Li Jiao and Tang Xiujing suggested that this was the result of the tendency at the time for officials to consider central government duties, no matter how menial, to be more honored than local government duties. They further suggested that central government officials be rotated to the prefectures, offering to go first themselves. Wu Zetian ordered that central government officials be put into random drawings, and some 20 officials were drawn out. She allowed them to keep their central government posts, but ordered that they also serve as acting prefects. Yang was one of the officials drawn, although it is not known which prefecture he was given. Later in 704, he was serving as the official in charge of then-capital Luoyang while Wu Zetian was at Chang'an, when he was made Neishi (), the head of the legislative bureau (鳳閣, Fengge) and a post considered one for a chancellor. It was said that, during the years that Yang served as a chancellor under Wu Zetian, he was known for his flattery. Once, when at a feast held by the official Zhang Tongxiu (), an older brother of Wu Zetian's lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, Zhang Tongxiu joked with Yang that he looked like someone from Goguryeo. Yang, taking the joke in stride, immediately made a hat, put it on, and did a Goguryeo-style dance, causing the guests to laugh. At that time, there was someone who praised Yang Changzong's looks, stating, \\"Liulang [(Zhang Changzong's nickname)] has a face that looks like a lotus flower.\\" Yang objected, and when Zhang Changzong asked why, he responded, \\"It is not that Liulang looks like lotus flower, but rather that the lotus flower looks like Liulang.\\" Later in 704, when Zhang Tongxiu and two other brothers, Zhang Changqi () and Zhang Changyi () were accused of corruption, Zhang Changzong was also investigated for corruption. The censors Li Chengjia () and Huan Yanfan proposed that Zhang Changzong be removed from office. Zhang Changzong objected, stating, \\"I have contributions to the state, and my crimes did not call for removal.\\" Wu Zetian asked the chancellors, \\"Does Zhang Changzong have contributions?\\" Yang responded, \\"Zhang Changzong made medications that are good for Your Imperial Majesty. This is the greatest contribution possible.\\" (Wu Zetian had used the guise that Zhang Changzong was making her medication as the rationale to let him have access to the palace.\\" Wu Zetian was very pleased, and she pardoned Zhang Changzong. This, however, caused the people to view Yang as a flatterer, and a low level official, Dai Lingyan (), wrote a satirical poem entitled, the Ode to the Two-Footed Fox (兩腳狐賦, Liangjiaohu Fu), satirizing Yang as a two-footed fox. When Yang saw the poem, he was incensed and demoted Dai. During his years serving under Wu Zetian, he also received progressively greater noble titles, from Baron of Hongnong eventually to Duke of Zheng.  During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign  In 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup. Tang Dynasty was restored, and her son Li Xian the Crown Prince, formerly emperor, was restored to the throne. A number of chancellors were removed from their posts as chancellors, but Yang was not; rather, he was made the minister of census (戶部尚書, Hubu Shangshu) with the de facto designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (), and made the official in charge of Chang'an. He was soon instead made the acting secretary general at Yang Prefecture (揚州, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), but kept the chancellor designation and did not appear to actually report to Yang Prefecture. Later in 705, he was again made acting head of the legislative bureau (now named Zhongshu Sheng (), with its head's title changed to Zhongshu Ling () and still chancellor. Four months later, he was made Shizhong (), the head of the examination bureau (now changed to Menxia Sheng ()) and still chancellor. By this point, he appeared to be a part of the faction of Emperor Zhongzong's powerful wife Empress Wei. In 706, when Emperor Zhongzong's son-in-law Wang Tongjiao () was accused of a treasonous plot with Zhang Zhongzhi (), Zu Yanqing (), and Zhou Jing (), of plotting to kill Empress Wei's lover Wu Sansi the Prince of Dejing (Wu Zetian's nephew) and then depose her, Zhang, while being interrogated, openly accused Empress Wei and Wu Sansi of adultery. Yang and another chancellor aligned with Empress Wei, Wei Juyuan, who were conducting the interrogation, were said to have simply ignored the accusations as if they did not hear them. In 707, Emperor Zhongzong's crown prince Li Chongjun, who was born of a concubine, angry at insults by Empress Wei's daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle and Li Guo'er's husband Wu Zhongxun (武崇訓, Wu Sansi's son) and attempts by Li Guo'er to be made crown princess to displace him, rose in rebellion and killed Wu Sansi and Wu Chongxun, and then approached the palace, intending to seize Empress Wei and Li Guo'er, as well as Emperor Zhongzong's concubine Consort Shangguan Wan'er, who was also Wu Sansi's lover. Yang was one of the high level officials who commanded troops against Li Chongjun, who subsequently was defeated and killed. In the aftermath of the rebellion, the chancellors Zong Chuke and JI Chuna, who wanted to implicate the senior chancellor Wei Yuanzhong (on account that Wei Yuanzhong's son Wei Sheng () had been forced into the rebellion), Yang supported Zong and Ji's efforts, and eventually, Wei Yuanzhong was exiled and died in exile. Later that year, Yang was again made Zhongshu Ling.

Dubbed the \\"King of Pop\\", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance techniques such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His sound and style have influenced artists of various genres, and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. Jackson is the most awarded artist in the history of popular music. The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records, and rose to solo stardom with his fifth studio album Off the Wall (1979) during the peak of the disco era. By the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those for \\"Beat It\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", and \\"Thriller\\" from his sixth studio album Thriller (1982), are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. Jackson's prominence propelled him and the television channel MTV into cultural phenomenons of 1980s pop culture. At the 1984 Grammy Awards, Thriller won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. Jackson continued to innovate with videos on the global best-seller albums Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991) and HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995). Starting in the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of court, and Jackson was not indicted. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. Four years later, while preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray. Fans around the world expressed their grief, and Jackson's public memorial service was broadcast live. In August 2009, the Los Angeles County Coroner ruled that Jackson's death was a homicide, and Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in November 2011. Seven years later, the documentary Leaving Neverland, which detailed posthumous allegations of child sexual abuse, led to another media backlash against Jackson. Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide. Thriller is the best-selling album of all time, with estimated sales of 66 million copies worldwide. In addition, the remix album Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix (1997) is the best- selling remix album of all time. Bad was the first album to produce five Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles. Jackson had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number- one singles, more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era, and was also the first artist to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. He received 13 Grammy Awards, the Grammy Legend and Grammy Lifetime Achievement awards, six Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness World Records, including the \\"Most Successful Entertainer of All Time\\". Jackson's inductions include the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Dance Hall of Fame (the only recording artist to be inducted), and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame. In 2016, his estate earned $825 million, the highest yearly amount for a celebrity ever recorded by Forbes. Life and career =1958–1975: Early life and the Jackson 5= Jackson's childhood home in Gary, Indiana, pictured in March 2010 with floral tributes after his death Michael Joseph JacksonCounty of Los Angeles Department of Health Services (2009). Michael Jackson death certificate. was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. Joe's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a US Army scout; family lore held that he was also \\"a Native American medicine man\\". Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth. Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose,\\" and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. Jackson said his youth was lonely and isolated. In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine. Later that year, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to the Jackson 5. The following year, the group won a talent show; Michael performed the dance to Robert Parker's 1965 song \\"Barefootin'\\" and singing lead to The Temptations' \\"My Girl\\". From 1966 to 1968 they toured the Midwest; they frequently played at a string of black clubs known as the \\"Chitlin' Circuit\\" as the opening act for artists such as Sam & Dave, the O'Jays, Gladys Knight, and Etta James. The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and cocktail lounges, where striptease shows were featured, and at local auditoriums and high school dances. In August 1967, while touring the East Coast, they won a weekly amateur night concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. African American performers to attain a crossover following. The Jackson 5 recorded several songs for a Gary record label, Steeltown Records; their first single, \\"Big Boy\\", was released in 1968. Bobby Taylor of Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers brought the Jackson 5 to Motown after the group opened for Taylor at Chicago's Regal Theater in 1968. Taylor also produced some of their early recordings for the label, including a version of \\"Who's Lovin' You\\". After signing with Motown, the Jackson family relocated from Gary to Los Angeles. In 1969, executives at Motown decided Diana Ross should introduce the Jackson 5 to the public—partly to bolster her career in television—sending off what was considered Motown's last product of its \\"production line\\". The Jackson 5 made their first television appearance in 1969 in the Miss Black America Pageant where they performed a cover of \\"It's Your Thing\\". Rolling Stone later described the young Michael as \\"a prodigy\\" with \\"overwhelming musical gifts\\" who \\"quickly emerged as the main draw and lead singer\\". In January 1970, \\"I Want You Back\\" became the first Jackson 5 song to reach number one the US Billboard Hot 100; it stayed there for four weeks. Three more singles with Motown—\\"ABC\\", \\"The Love You Save\\", and \\"I'll Be There\\"—also topped the chart. In May 1971, the Jackson family moved into a large house on a two-acre estate in Encino, California. During this period, Michael developed from a child performer into a teen idol. As he emerged as a solo performer in the early 1970s, he maintained ties to the Jackson 5. Between 1972 and 1975, Michael released four solo studio albums with Motown: Got to Be There (1972), Ben (1972), Music & Me (1973), and Forever, Michael (1975). \\"Got to Be There\\" and \\"Ben\\", the title tracks from his first two solo albums, sold well as singles, as did a cover of Bobby Day's \\"Rockin' Robin\\". The Jackson 5 were later described as \\"a cutting-edge example of black crossover artists.\\" They were frustrated by Motown's refusal to allow them creative input. Jackson's performance of their top five single \\"Dancing Machine\\" on Soul Train popularized the robot dance. =1975–1981: Move to Epic and Off the Wall= From left, back row: Jackie Jackson, Michael Jackson, Tito Jackson, Marlon Jackson. Middle row: Randy Jackson, La Toya Jackson, Rebbie Jackson. Front row: Janet Jackson (1977) In 1975, the Jackson 5 left Motown. They signed with Epic Records, a subsidiary of CBS Records, and renamed themselves the Jacksons. Their younger brother Randy joined the band around this time; Jermaine stayed with Motown and pursued a solo career. The Jacksons continued to tour internationally, and released six more albums between 1976 and 1984. Michael, the group's main songwriter during this time, wrote songs such as \\"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)\\" (1979), \\"This Place Hotel\\" (1980), and \\"Can You Feel It\\" (1980). In 1978, Jackson moved to New York City to star as the Scarecrow in The Wiz, a musical directed by Sidney Lumet. It costarred Diana Ross, Nipsey Russell, and Ted Ross. The film was a box-office failure. Its score was arranged by Quincy Jones, who later produced three of Jackson's solo albums. During his time in New York, Jackson frequented the Studio 54 nightclub, where he heard early hip hop; this influenced his beatboxing on future tracks such as \\"Working Day and Night\\". In 1979, Jackson broke his nose during a dance routine. A rhinoplasty led to breathing difficulties that later affected his career. He was referred to Steven Hoefflin, who performed Jackson's subsequent operations. Jackson's fifth solo album, Off the Wall (1979), established him as a solo performer and helped him move from the bubblegum pop of his youth to more complex sounds. It produced four top 10 entries in the US: \\"Off the Wall\\", \\"She's Out of My Life\\", and the chart- topping singles \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\" and \\"Rock with You\\". The album reached number three on the US Billboard 200 and sold over 20 million copies worldwide. In 1980, Jackson won three American Music Awards for his solo work: Favorite Soul/R&B; Album, Favorite Soul/R&B; Male Artist, and Favorite Soul/R&B; Single for \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\". He also won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B; Vocal Performance for 1979 with \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\". In 1981 Jackson was the American Music Awards winner for Favorite Soul/R&B; Album and Favorite Soul/R&B; Male Artist. Jackson felt Off the Wall should have made a bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release. In 1980, he secured the highest royalty rate in the music industry: 37 percent of wholesale album profit. =1982–1983: Thriller and Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever= The sequined jacket and white glove worn by Jackson at Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever. British Vogue called Jackson \\"a fashion pioneer [...] who gave new meaning to moonwalking, immortalised solitary, [and] sparkly gloves\\"Jackson recorded with Queen singer Freddie Mercury from 1981 to 1983, recording demos of \\"State of Shock\\", \\"Victory\\" and \\"There Must Be More to Life Than This\\". The recordings were intended for an album of duets but, according to Queen's manager Jim Beach, the relationship soured when Jackson brought a llama into the recording studio, and Jackson was upset by Mercury's drug use. The songs were released in 2014. Jackson went on to record \\"State of Shock\\" with Mick Jagger for the Jacksons' album Victory (1984). In 1982, Jackson contributed \\"Someone in the Dark\\" to the storybook for the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Jackson's sixth album, Thriller, was released in late 1982. It was the best-selling album worldwide in 1983, and became the best-selling album of all time in the US and the best-selling album of all time worldwide, selling an estimated copies. It topped the Billboard 200 chart for 37 weeks and was in the top 10 of the 200 for 80 consecutive weeks. It was the first album to have seven Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles, including \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". On March 25, 1983, Jackson reunited with his brothers for Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16, 1983, to an estimated audience of , and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars. Jackson's solo performance of \\"Billie Jean\\" earned him his first Emmy Award nomination. Wearing a glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his moonwalk dance, which Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier, and it became his signature dance in his repertoire. Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to the show, believing he had been doing too much television. But at the request of Motown founder Berry Gordy, he performed in exchange for an opportunity to do a solo performance. Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore called the performance \\"extraordinary.\\" Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis Presley's and the Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times praised the perfect timing and technique involved in the dance. Gordy described being \\"mesmerized\\" by the performance. At the 26th Annual Grammy Awards, Thriller won eight awards, while Jackson also won an award for the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. Winning eight Grammys in one ceremony is a record he holds with the band Santana. Jackson and Quincy Jones won the award for Producer of the Year (Non-Classical). Thriller won Album of the Year (with Jackson as the album's artist and Jones as its co-producer), and the single won Best Pop Vocal Performance (Male) award for Jackson. \\"Beat It\\" won Record of the Year and Best Rock Vocal Performance (Male). \\"Billie Jean\\" won two Grammy awards: Best R&B; Song and Best R&B; Vocal Performance (Male), with Jackson as songwriter and singer respectively. Thriller also won the Grammy for Best Engineered Recording (Non Classical), acknowledging Bruce Swedien for his work on the album. At the 11th Annual American Music Awards, Jackson won another eight awards and became the youngest artist to win the Award of Merit. He also won Favorite Male Artist, Favorite Soul/R&B; Artist, and Favorite Pop/Rock Artist. \\"Beat It\\" won Favorite Soul/R&B; Video, Favorite Pop/Rock Video and Favorite Pop/Rock Single. The album collectively won Favorite Soul/R&B; Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Album. Jackson had the highest royalty rate in the music industry at that point, with about $2 for every album sold (), and was making record- breaking profits. Dolls modeled after Jackson appeared in stores in May 1984 for $12 each. In the same year, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, a music documentary, won a Grammy for Best Music Video (Longform). Time described Jackson's influence at that point as \\"star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too.\\" The New York Times wrote \\"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else.\\" =1984–1985: Pepsi, \\"We Are the World\\", and business career= During the Thriller era, Jackson (pictured in 1984) had established himself as the most famous figure in pop culture. In November 1983, Jackson and his brothers partnered with PepsiCo in a $5 million promotional deal that broke records for a celebrity endorsement (). The first Pepsi campaign, which ran in the US from 1983 to 1984 and launched its \\"New Generation\\" theme, included tour sponsorship, public relations events, and in-store displays. Jackson helped to create the advertisement, and suggested using his song \\"Billie Jean\\", with revised lyrics, as its jingle. On January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi commercial overseen by Phil Dusenberry, a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its Michael Jackson Burn Center is named in his honor. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for $10 million. The second campaign covered 20 countries and provided financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987–88 world tour. Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, but none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi. On May 14, 1984, President Ronald Reagan gave Jackson an award recognizing his support of alcohol and drug abuse charities, and in recognition of his support for the Ad Council's and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Drunk Driving Prevention campaign. Jackson allowed the campaign to use \\"Beat It\\" for its public service announcements.The Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers. Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated , to charity. During the last concert of the Victory Tour at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Jackson announced his split from The Jacksons during \\"Shake Your Body\\". His charitable work continued with the release of \\"We Are the World\\" (1985), co-written with Lionel Richie, which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa. It earned $63 million (), and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with 20 million copies sold. It won four Grammy Awards in 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie as its writers. The project's creators received two special American Music Awards honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the USA for Africa idea. Jackson, Jones, and promoter Ken Kragen received special awards for their roles in the song's creation. Jackson collaborated with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s, and learned that McCartney was making $40 million a year from owning the rights to other artists' songs. By 1983, Jackson had begun buying publishing rights to others' songs, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly Stone collection included \\"Everyday People\\" (1968), Len Barry's \\"1-2-3\\" (1965), and Dion DiMucci's \\"The Wanderer\\" (1961) and \\"Runaround Sue\\" (1961). In 1984 Robert Holmes à Court announced he was selling the ATV Music Publishing catalog comprising the publishing rights to nearly 4000 songs, including most of the Beatles' material. In 1981, McCartney had been offered the catalog for £20 million ($40 million). Jackson submitted a bid of $46 million on November 20, 1984. When Jackson and McCartney were unable to make a joint purchase, McCartney did not want to be the sole owner of the Beatles' songs, and did not pursue an offer on his own. Jackson's agents were unable to come to a deal, and in May 1985 left talks after having spent more than $1 million and four months of due diligence work on the negotiations. In June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that Charles Koppelman's and Marty Bandier's The Entertainment Company had made a tentative offer to buy ATV Music for $50 million; in early August, Holmes à Court contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson's increased bid of $47.5 million () was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due diligence. Jackson also agreed to visit Holmes à Court in Australia, where he would appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. Jackson's purchase of ATV Music was finalized on August 10, 1985. =1986–1987: Changing appearance, tabloids, and films= Jackson's skin had been medium-brown during his youth, but from the mid-1980s gradually grew paler. The change drew widespread media coverage, including speculation that he had been bleaching his skin. Jackson's dermatologist, Arnold Klein, said he observed in 1983 that Jackson had vitiligo, a condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment, and sensitivity to sunlight. He also identified discoid lupus erythematosus in Jackson. He diagnosed Jackson with lupus that year, and with vitiligo in 1986. Vitiligo's drastic effects on the body can cause psychological distress. Jackson used fair-colored makeup, and possibly skin-bleaching prescription creams, to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness. The creams would have further lightened his skin, and, with the application of makeup, he could appear very pale. Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and could not control his vitiligo, adding, \\"When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me.\\" He became friends with Klein and Klein's nurse Debbie Rowe. Rowe later became Jackson's second wife and the mother of his first two children. In his autobiography and the 1993 interview with Winfrey, Jackson said he had had two rhinoplasty surgeries and a cleft chin surgery but no more than that. He said he lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in diet to achieve a dancer's body. Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy, and speculated he was suffering from anorexia nervosa. Periods of weight loss became a recurring problem later in his life. After his death, his mother Katherine told Winfrey that he first turned to cosmetic procedures to remedy his vitiligo, because he did not want to look like a \\"spotted cow.\\" She said her son had received more than the two cosmetic surgeries he claimed and speculated that he was addicted to them. In 1986, tabloids reported that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow aging, and pictured him lying in a glass box. The claim was untrue, and tabloids reported that he spread the story himself. It was also reported, by the tabloids, that Jackson took female hormone shots to keep his voice high and facial hair wispy, proposed to Elizabeth Taylor and possibly had a shrine of her, and had cosmetic surgery on his eyes. Jackson's manager Frank DiLeo denied all of them, except for Jackson having a chamber. DiLeo added \\"I don't know if he sleeps in it. I'm not for it. But Michael thinks it's something that's probably healthy for him. He's a bit of a health fanatic.\\" When Jackson took his pet chimpanzee Bubbles to tour in Japan, their public appearances caused a stir in the media. They portrayed Jackson as an aspiring Disney cartoon character who befriended various animals. Meanwhile, it was also reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick (the \\"Elephant Man\\"). In June 1987, the Chicago Tribune reported Jackson's publicist bidding $1 million for the skeleton to the London Hospital Medical College on his behalf. The college maintained the skeleton was not for sale. DiLeo said Jackson had an \\"absorbing interest\\" in Merrick, \\"purely based on his awareness of the ethical, medical and historical significance.\\" These tabloid stories inspired the name \\"Wacko Jacko,\\" which Jackson came to despise. According to music journalist Joseph Vogel, the demeaning name first appeared in British tabloid The Sun in 1985. The name's origins come from Jacko Macacco, the name of a famous monkey used in monkey-baiting matches at the Westminster Pit in the early 1820s. \\"Jacko\\" was subsequently used in Cockney slang to refer to monkeys in general, hence a racist connotation behind the name. In 1987, Rolling Stone described Jackson as \\"the flighty-genius star-child, a celebrity virtually all his life, who dwells in a fairy-tale kingdom of fellow celebrities, animals, mannequins and cartoons, who provides endless fodder for the tabloids.... But it’s the same child in Michael who inspires the artistry that fuels all the subsidiary industries, who turns his primal fears and fantasies into wondrous, hyperkinetic and emotional music.\\" Jackson worked with George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola on the 17-minute $30 million 3D film Captain EO, which ran from 1986 at Disneyland and Epcot, and later at Tokyo Disneyland and Euro Disneyland. After having been removed in the late 1990s, it returned to the theme park for several years after Jackson's death. In 1987, Jackson disassociated himself from the Jehovah's Witnesses. Katherine Jackson said this might have been because some Witnesses strongly opposed the Thriller video. Jackson had denounced it in a Witness publication in 1984. =1987–1990: Bad, autobiography, and Neverland= Jackson and President George H. W. Bush at the White House on April 5, 1990. It was the second time that Jackson had been honored by a President of the United States. Jackson's first album in five years, Bad (1987), was highly anticipated, with the industry expecting another major success. It became the first album to produce five US number-one singles: \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\", \\"Bad\\", \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\", \\"Man in the Mirror\\", and \\"Dirty Diana\\". Another song, \\"Smooth Criminal\\", peaked at number seven. Bad won the 1988 Grammy for Best Engineered Recording – Non Classical and the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Music Video, Short Form for \\"Leave Me Alone\\". Jackson won an Award of Achievement at the American Music Awards in 1989 after Bad generated five number-one singles, became the first album to top the charts in 25 countries and the best-selling album worldwide in 1987 and 1988. By 2012, it had sold between 30 and 45 million copies worldwide. The Bad world tour ran from September 12, 1987, to January 14, 1989. In Japan, the tour had 14 sellouts and drew 570,000 people, nearly tripling the previous record for a single tour. The 504,000 people who attended seven sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium set a new Guinness world record. In 1988, Jackson released his autobiography, Moonwalk, with input from Stephen Davis and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. It sold 200,000 copies, and reached the top of the New York Times bestsellers list. Jackson discussed his childhood, the Jackson 5, and the abuse from his father. He attributed his changing facial appearance to three plastic surgeries, puberty, weight loss, a strict vegetarian diet, a change in hairstyle, and stage lighting. In October, Jackson released a film, Moonwalker, which featured live footage and short films starring Jackson and Joe Pesci. In the US it was released direct-to- video and became the best-selling video cassette. The RIAA certified it as Platinum. In March 1988, Jackson purchased of land near Santa Ynez, California, to build a new home, Neverland Ranch, at a cost of $17 million (). He installed a Ferris wheel, a carousel, a movie theater and a zoo. A security staff of 40 patrolled the grounds. Shortly afterwards, he appeared in the first Western television advertisement in the Soviet Union. Jackson became known as the \\"King of Pop\\", a nickname that Jackson's publicists embraced. When Elizabeth Taylor presented him with the Soul Train Heritage Award in 1989, she called him \\"the true king of pop, rock and soul.\\" President George H. W. Bush designated him the White House's \\"Artist of the Decade\\". From 1985 to 1990, Jackson donated $455,000 to the United Negro College Fund, and all profits from his single \\"Man in the Mirror\\" went to charity. His rendition of \\"You Were There\\" at Sammy Davis Jr.'s 60th birthday celebration won Jackson a second Emmy nomination. =1991–1993: Dangerous, Heal the World Foundation, and Super Bowl XXVII halftime show= − In March 1991, Jackson renewed his contract with Sony for $65 million (), a record-breaking deal, beating Neil Diamond's renewal contract with Columbia Records. In 1991, he released his eighth album, Dangerous, co-produced with Teddy Riley. It was certified seven times platinum in the US, and by 2008 had sold 30 million copies worldwide. In the US, the first single, \\"Black or White\\", was the album's highest charting song; it was number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks and achieved similar chart performances worldwide. The second single, \\"Remember the Time\\" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. At the end of 1992, Dangerous was the best-selling album of the year worldwide and \\"Black or White\\" the best-selling single of the year worldwide at the Billboard Music Awards. Jackson was also the best-selling artist of the 1980s. In 1993, he performed \\"Remember the Time\\" at the Soul Train Music Awards in a chair, saying he twisted his ankle during dance rehearsals. In the UK, \\"Heal the World\\" made No. 2 on the charts in 1992. Jackson during the Dangerous World Tour in 1993. Dangerous has been recognized by writers as an influence on contemporary pop and R&B; artists. Jackson founded the Heal the World Foundation in 1992. The charity brought underprivileged children to Jackson's ranch to use the theme park rides, and sent millions of dollars around the globe to help children threatened by war, poverty, and disease. That July, Jackson published his second book, Dancing the Dream, a collection of poetry. The Dangerous World Tour ran between June 1992 and November 1993 and grossed (); Jackson performed for 3.5 million people in 70 concerts, all of which were outside the US. Part of the proceeds went to Heal the World Foundation. Jackson sold the broadcast rights of the tour to HBO for $20 million, a record-breaking deal that still stands. Following the death of HIV/AIDS spokesperson and friend Ryan White, Jackson pleaded with the Clinton administration at Bill Clinton's inaugural gala to give more money to HIV/AIDS charities and research and performed \\"Gone Too Soon\\", a song dedicated to White, and \\"Heal the World\\" at the gala. Jackson visited Africa in early 1992; on his first stop in Gabon he was greeted by more than 100,000 people, some of them carrying signs that read \\"Welcome Home Michael\\". During his trip to Ivory Coast, Jackson was crowned \\"King Sani\\" by a tribal chief. He thanked the dignitaries in French and English, signed documents formalizing his kingship, and sat on a golden throne while presiding over ceremonial dances. In January 1993, Jackson performed at the Super Bowl XXVII halftime show in Pasadena, California. The NFL sought a big-name artist to keep ratings high during halftime following dwindling audience figures. It was the first Super Bowl whose half-time performance drew greater audience figures than the game. Jackson played \\"Jam\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Black or White\\", and \\"Heal the World\\". Dangerous rose 90 places in the album chart after the performance. Jackson gave a 90-minute interview to Winfrey on February 10, 1993. He spoke of his childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood, and said that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated for the first time that he had vitiligo. Dangerous re-entered the album chart in the top 10, more than a year after its release. In January 1993, Jackson won three American Music Awards: Favorite Pop/Rock Album (Dangerous), Favorite Soul/R&B; Single (\\"Remember the Time\\"), and was the first to win the International Artist Award of Excellence.

Jordan said he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. Jordan's mother initially told police that she did not believe Jackson had molested her son; however, her position wavered a few days later. Evan was recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, which Jackson used to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father trying to extort money. Jackson's older sister La Toya accused him of being a pedophile, which she later retracted. Police raided Jackson's home in December and found books and photographs featuring young boys with little or no clothing. The books were legal to own, and Jackson was not indicted. Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's genitals. A strip search was made, and the jurors felt the description was not a match. In January 1994, Jackson settled with the Chandlers out of court for $25 million (). The police never pressed criminal charges. Citing a lack of evidence without Jordan's testimony, the state closed its investigation on September 22, 1994. Jackson had been taking painkillers for his reconstructive scalp surgeries, administered due to the Pepsi commercial accident in 1984, and became dependent on them to cope with the stress of the sexual abuse allegations. On November 12, 1993, Jackson canceled the remainder of the Dangerous Tour due to health problems, stress from the allegations and painkiller addiction. He thanked close friend Elizabeth Taylor for support, encouragement and counsel. The end of the tour concluded his relationship with Pepsi-Cola which sponsored the tour. In late 1993 Jackson proposed to Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis Presley, over the phone. They married in La Vega, Dominican Republic in May 1994 by civil judge Hugo Francisco Alvarez Perez. The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a publicity stunt to deflect Jackson's sexual abuse allegations and jump-start Presley's career as a singer. Their marriage ended little more than a year later, and they separated in December 1995. Presley cited \\"irreconcilable differences\\" when filing for divorce the next month and only sought to reclaim her maiden name as her settlement. After the divorce, Judge Perez said, \\"They lasted longer than I thought they would. I gave them a year. They lasted a year and a half.\\" =1995–1997: HIStory, second marriage, and fatherhood= In June 1995, Jackson released the double album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. The first disc, HIStory Begins, is a greatest hits album (reissued in 2001 as Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I). The second disc, HIStory Continues, contains 13 original songs and two cover versions.

It is the best-selling multi-disc album of all time, with 20 million copies (40 million units) sold worldwide. HIStory received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. The New York Times reviewed it as \\"the testimony of a musician whose self-pity now equals his talent\\". The first single from HIStory was \\"Scream/Childhood\\". \\"Scream\\", a duet with Jackson's youngest sister Janet, protests the media's treatment of Jackson during the 1993 child abuse allegations against him. The single made number five on the Billboard Hot 100, and received a Grammy nomination for \\"Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals\\". The second single, \\"You Are Not Alone\\", holds the Guinness world record for the first song to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It received a Grammy nomination for \\"Best Pop Vocal Performance\\" in 1995. In 1995 the Anti-Defamation League and other groups complained that \\"Jew me, sue me, everybody do me/ Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me\\", the original lyrics of \\"They Don't Care About Us\\", were antisemitic. Jackson released a version with revised words. In late 1995, Jackson was admitted to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance, caused by a stress-related panic attack. In November, Jackson merged his ATV Music catalog with Sony's music publishing division, creating Sony/ATV Music Publishing. He retained ownership of half the company, earning $95 million up front () as well as the rights to more songs.Jackson at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for the Michael Jackson's Ghosts short film premiere \\"Earth Song\\" was the third single released from HIStory, and topped the UK Singles Chart for six weeks over Christmas 1995. It became the 87th-bestselling single in the UK. At the 1996 Brit Awards, Jackson's performance of \\"Earth Song\\" was disrupted by Pulp singer Jarvis Cocker, who was protesting what Cocker saw as Jackson's \\"Christ-like\\" persona. Jackson said the stage invasion was \\"disgusting and cowardly\\". In 1996, Jackson won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form, for \\"Scream\\" and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist. Jackson promoted HIStory with the HIStory World Tour, from September 7, 1996, to October 15, 1997.

The show raised a million dollars for refugees of the Kosovo War, and additional funds for the children of Guatemala. Later that month, Jackson organized a series of \\"Michael Jackson & Friends\\" benefit concerts in Germany and Korea. Other artists involved included Slash, The Scorpions, Boyz II Men, Luther Vandross, Mariah Carey, A. R. Rahman, Prabhu Deva Sundaram, Shobana, Andrea Bocelli, and Luciano Pavarotti. The proceeds went to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, the Red Cross and UNESCO. From August 1999 to 2000, he lived in New York City at 4 East 74th Street. At the turn of the century, Jackson won an American Music Award as Artist of the 1980s. In 2000, Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer. In September 2001, two 30th Anniversary concerts were held at Madison Square Garden to mark Jackson's 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson performed with his brothers for the first time since 1984. The show also featured Mýa, Usher, Whitney Houston, Destiny's Child, Monica, Liza Minnelli, and Slash. The first show was marred by technical lapses, and the crowd booed a speech by Marlon Brando. Almost 30 million people watched the television broadcast of the shows in November. After 9/11, Jackson helped organize the United We Stand: What More Can I Give benefit concert at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. on October 21, 2001. Jackson performed \\"What More Can I Give\\" as the finale. The release of Invincible was preceded by a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had expected the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him in the early 2000s, after which he would be able to promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits, but clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract. Invincible was released on October 30, 2001. It was Jackson's first full- length album in six years, and the last album of original material he released in his lifetime. It debuted at number one in 13 countries and went on to sell 6 million copies worldwide, receiving double-platinum certification in the US. Jackson in 2003 On January 9, 2002, Jackson won his 22nd American Music Award for Artist of the Century. Later that year, an anonymous surrogate mother gave birth to his third child, Prince Michael Jackson II (nicknamed \\"Blanket\\"), who had been conceived by artificial insemination. On November 20, Jackson briefly held Blanket over the railing of his Berlin hotel room, four stories above ground level, prompting widespread criticism in the media. Jackson apologized for the incident, calling it \\"a terrible mistake.\\" On January 22, promoter Marcel Avram filed a breach of contract complaint against Jackson for failing to perform two planned 1999 concerts. In March, a Santa Maria jury ordered Jackson to pay Avram $5.3 million. On December 18, 2003, Jackson's attorneys dropped all appeals on the verdict and settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount. On April 24, 2002, Jackson performed at Apollo Theater. The concert was a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and former President Bill Clinton. The money collected would be used to encourage citizens to vote. It raised $2.5 million. The concert was called Michael Jackson: Live at the Apollo and this would be Jackson's final on-stage performance. In July 2002, Jackson called Sony Music chairman Tommy Mottola \\"a racist, and very, very, very devilish,\\" and someone who exploits black artists for his own gain, at Al Sharpton's National Action Network in Harlem. The accusation prompted Sharpton to form a coalition investigating whether Mottola exploited black artists. Jackson also charged that Mottola had called his colleague Irv Gotti a \\"fat nigger\\". Responding to those attacks, Sony issued a statement calling them \\"ludicrous, spiteful, and hurtful\\" and defended Mottola as someone who had championed Jackson's career for many years. Sony ultimately refused to renew Jackson's contract and claimed that a promotional campaign had failed because Jackson refused to tour in the US for Invincible. =2002–2005: Second child sexual abuse allegations, trial, and acquittal= Jackson's mug shot, taken on November 20, 2003 Beginning in May 2002, a documentary film crew led by Martin Bashir followed Jackson for several months. The documentary, broadcast in February 2003 as Living with Michael Jackson, showed Jackson holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with a 12-year-old boy. He also said that he saw nothing wrong with having sleepovers with minors and sharing his bed and bedroom with various people, which aroused controversy. He insisted that the sleepovers were not sexual and that his words had been misunderstood. On December 18, 2003, Santa Barbara authorities charged Jackson with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of intoxicating a minor with alcoholic drinks. Jackson denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty. The People v. Jackson trial began on January 31, 2005, in Santa Maria, California, and lasted until the end of May. Jackson found the experience stressful and it affected his health. If convicted, he would have faced up to 20 years in prison. On June 13, 2005, Jackson was acquitted on all counts. After the trial, he became reclusive and moved to Bahrain as a guest of Sheikh Abdullah. Jermaine Jackson later said the family had planned to send Michael there had he been convicted. On November 18, 2003, Sony released Number Ones, a greatest hits compilation. It was certified triple platinum by the RIAA, and six times platinum in the UK, for shipments of at least 1.2 million units. =2006–2009: Closure of Neverland, final years, and This Is It= Jackson and his son Blanket in Disneyland Paris, 2006 In April 2006, Jackson agreed to use a piece of his ATV catalog stake, then worth about $1 billion, as collateral against his $270 million worth of loans from Bank of America. Bank of America had sold the loans to Fortress Investments, an investment company that buys distressed loans, the year before. As part of the agreement, Fortress Investments provided Jackson a new loan of $300 million with reduced interest payments (). Sony Music would have the option to buy half of his stake, or about 25% of the catalog, at a set price. Jackson's financial managers had urged him to shed part of his stake to avoid bankruptcy. The main house at Neverland Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure, while Jackson lived in Bahrain at the hospitality of Sheik Abdullah, the ruler's son. At least 30 of Jackson's employees had not been paid on time and were owed $306,000 in back wages; Jackson was ordered to pay $100,000 in penalties. In early 2006, it was announced that Jackson had signed a contract with a Bahrain-based startup, Two Seas Records; nothing came of the deal, and Two Seas CEO Guy Holmes later said it was never finalized. That October, Fox News reported that Jackson had been recording at a studio in County Westmeath, Ireland. It was not known what Jackson was working on, or who had paid for the sessions; his publicist stated that he had left Two Seas by then. During his period in Ireland he sought out Patrick Treacy for cosmetic treatment after reading about his experience with hyaluronic acid fillers and his charitable work in Africa. Treacy became Jackson's personal dermatologist. In November 2006, Jackson invited an Access Hollywood camera crew into the studio in Westmeath, and MSNBC reported that he was working on a new album, produced by will.i.am. On November 15, Jackson performed at the World Music Awards in London and accepted the Diamond Award honoring the sale of over records. He returned to the US in December 2006 to attend James Brown's funeral in Augusta, Georgia, where he gave a eulogy calling Brown his greatest inspiration. In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought another music publishing company, Famous Music LLC, formerly owned by Viacom. The deal gave him the rights to songs by Eminem and Beck, among others. In March 2007, Jackson gave a brief interview to the Associated Press in Tokyo, in which he said he had no regrets about his lifelong career despite difficulties and \\"deliberate attempts to hurt [him]\\". That month, Jackson visited a US Army post in Japan, Camp Zama, to greet over 3,000 troops and their families. In September 2007, Jackson was still working on his next album, which he never completed. In 2008, Jackson and Sony released Thriller 25 to mark the album's 25th anniversary. Two remixes were released as singles: \\"The Girl Is Mine 2008\\" (with will.i.am), based on a demo version without Paul McCartney, and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008\\" with Akon. For Jackson's 50th birthday, Sony BMG released a series of greatest hits albums titled King of Pop. Different versions were released in various countries, based on polls of local fans. An aerial view of part of Jackson's 2,800-acre (11 km2) Neverland Valley Ranch near Los Olivos, California, showing the rides In 2008, Fortress Investments threatened to foreclose on Neverland Ranch, which Jackson had used as collateral for his loans. Fortress sold Jackson's debts to Colony Capital LLC. In November, Jackson transferred Neverland Ranch's title to Sycamore Valley Ranch Company LLC, a joint venture between Jackson and Colony Capital LLC. The deal earned him . Jackson arranged to sell a large collection of his memorabilia of more than 1,000 items through Julien's Auction House. On the eve of the first public exhibit, Jackson canceled the action after earning between $200 million to $300 million of initial sales from a series of concerts to be held in London. In March 2009, amid speculation about his finances and health, Jackson announced a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, at a press conference at The O2 Arena. The shows were to be his first major concerts since the HIStory World Tour that ended in 1997. Jackson suggested he would retire after the shows. The initial plan was for 10 concerts in London, followed by shows in Paris, New York City and Mumbai. Randy Phillips, president and chief executive of AEG Live, predicted the first 10 dates would earn Jackson £50 million. The London residency was increased to 50 dates after record-breaking ticket sales; over one million were sold in less than two hours. The concerts were to run from July 13, 2009 to March 6, 2010. Jackson rehearsed in Los Angeles in the weeks leading up to the tour under the direction of choreographer Kenny Ortega, whom he worked with during his previous tours. Most rehearsals took place at the Staples Center owned by AEG. Death Fans placed flowers and notes on Jackson's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on the day of his death On June 25, 2009, less than three weeks before the first This Is It show was due to begin in London, with all concerts sold out, Jackson died from cardiac arrest. Conrad Murray, his personal physician, had given Jackson various medications to help him sleep at his rented mansion in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. Paramedics received a 911 call at 12:22 pm Pacific time (19:22 UTC), and arrived three minutes later. Jackson was not breathing and CPR was performed. Resuscitation efforts continued en route to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, and for more than an hour after arriving there, but were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm Pacific time (21:26 UTC). Jackson had taken propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam; his death was caused by a propofol overdose. News of his death spread quickly online, causing websites to slow down and crash from user overload, and putting unprecedented strain on services and websites including Google, AOL Instant Messenger, Twitter, and Wikipedia. Overall, web traffic rose by between 11% and 20%. MTV and BET aired marathons of Jackson's music videos. Jackson specials aired on television stations around the world. MTV briefly returned to its original music video format, and aired hours of Jackson's music videos, with live news specials featuring reactions from MTV personalities and other celebrities. =Memorial service= Jackson's unmarked crypt at the end of the Sanctuary of Ascension in the Holly Terrace of the Great Mausoleum, Forest Lawn Glendale Jackson's memorial was held on July 7, 2009, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, preceded by a private family service at Forest Lawn Memorial Park's Hall of Liberty. Over 1.6 million fans applied for tickets to the memorial; the 8,750 recipients were drawn at random, and each received two tickets. The memorial service was one of the most watched events in streaming history, with an estimated US audience of 31.1 million. Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, Jennifer Hudson, and Shaheen Jafargholi performed at the event. Smokey Robinson and Queen Latifah gave eulogies. Al Sharpton received a standing ovation with cheers when he told Jackson's children, \\"Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal with. But he dealt with it anyway.\\" Jackson's 11-year-old daughter Paris Katherine, speaking publicly for the first time, wept as she addressed the crowd. The Rev. Lucious Smith provided a closing prayer. Jackson's body was entombed on September 3, 2009, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. =Criminal investigation and prosecution= Fans visiting the makeshift memorial set up outside the Neverland Ranch entrance shortly after Jackson's death. In August 2009, the Los Angeles County Coroner ruled that Jackson's death was a homicide. Law enforcement officials charged Murray with involuntary manslaughter on February 8, 2010. On June 25, 2010, the first anniversary of Jackson's death, fans, family and friends visited Jackson's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, his family home, and Forest Lawn Memorial Park. Many left tributes at the sites. Murray's trial took place from September 27 to November 7, 2011, and he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and held without bail to await sentencing. 22 days after the trial ended, Murray received the maximum sentence of four years in prison. He was released on October 28, 2013 due to California prison overcrowding and good behavior. =Posthumous sales= At the 2009 American Music Awards, Jackson won four posthumous awards, including two for his compilation album Number Ones, bringing his total American Music Awards to 26. In the year after his death, more than 8.2 million of Jackson's albums sold in the US, and 35 million albums worldwide, more than any other artist in 2009. He became the first artist to sell one million music downloads in a week, with 2.6 million song downloads. Thriller, Number Ones and The Essential Michael Jackson became the first catalog albums to outsell any new album. Jackson also became the first artist to have four of the top 20 best- selling albums in a single year in the US. On March 16, 2010, following the surge in sales, Sony Music signed a $250 million deal () with the Jackson estate to extend their distribution rights to Jackson's back catalog until at least 2017; it had been due to expire in 2015. It was the most expensive music contract for a single artist in history. They also agreed to release ten albums of previously unreleased material and new collections of released work. In 2017, Sony Music Entertainment extended its deal with the estate; that July, a Los Angeles court awarded Jones $9.4 million of disputed royalty payments for Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad. In July 2018, Sony/ATV bought the estate's stake in EMI for $287.5 million. In 2014, Jackson became the first artist to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. In December 2015, Thriller was certified for 30 million shipments by the RIAA, one of only two albums to do so in the US. A year later, it was certified at 33× platinum, after Soundscan added streams and audio downloads to album certifications. =Posthumous releases and productions= The first posthumous Jackson song, \\"This Is It\\", co-written in the 1980s with Paul Anka, was released in October 2009. The surviving Jackson brothers reunited to record backing vocals. On October 28, 2009, Sony released a documentary film about the rehearsals, Michael Jackson's This Is It. Despite a limited two-week engagement, it became the highest-grossing documentary or concert film ever, with earnings of more than worldwide. Jackson's estate received 90% of the profits. The film was accompanied by a compilation album of the same name. In late 2010, Sony released the first posthumous album, Michael and the promotional single \\"Breaking News\\". Jackson collaborator Will.i.am expressed \\"disgust\\" regarding the posthumous album, Michael, explaining that Jackson was such a perfectionist that he would not release them without his approval. Video game developer Ubisoft released a music video game featuring Jackson for the 2010 holiday season, Michael Jackson: The Experience; it was among the first games to use Kinect and PlayStation Move, the motion-detecting camera systems for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 respectively. Xscape, an album of unreleased material, was released on May 13, 2014. Later that year, Queen released a duet recorded with Jackson and Freddie Mercury in the 1980s. A compilation album, Scream, was released on September 29, 2017. In October 2011, the theater company Cirque du Soleil launched Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour, a $57-million production, in Montreal, with a permanent show resident in Las Vegas. A larger and more theatrical Cirque show, Michael Jackson: One, designed for residency at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas, opened on May 23, 2013 in a renovated theater. A jukebox musical, Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, is due to debut on Broadway in mid-2020. The musical is directed and choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon and features a book by Lynn Nottage. A developmental lab for the musical was delayed and a pre-Broadway run in Chicago was canceled in the wake of the renewed claims of child sexual abuse. In April 2011, Mohamed Al-Fayed, chairman of Fulham Football Club, unveiled a statue of Jackson outside the club stadium, Craven Cottage. It was moved to the National Football Museum in Manchester in May 2014, then removed from display in March 2019 following renewed sexual assault allegations. In 2012, in an attempt to end a family dispute, Jackson's brother Jermaine retracted his signature on a public letter criticizing executors of Jackson's estate and his mother's advisers over the legitimacy of his brother's will. T.J. Jackson, son of Tito Jackson, was given co-guardianship of Michael Jackson's children after false reports of Katherine Jackson going missing. A duet between Jackson and Justin Timberlake titled \\"Love Never Felt So Good\\" was released in 2014, which made him the first artist to have a top 10 single on the US Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades when the single reached number 9. In November 2019, it was reported that a Jackson biopic, produced by Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) producer Graham King, was in the works, with the screenplay written by John Logan. Jackson's estate granted King the rights to his music and will work with King. =Leaving Neverland and posthumous child sexual abuse allegations= Jackson and Safechuck (right) in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1988 In 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old. In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck, alleging sexual abuse over a four-year period from the age of ten. Both had testified in Jackson's defense during the 1993 allegations; Robson did so again in 2005. In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed on the grounds of being filed too late. Safechuck's claim was also time barred. In 2017, it was ruled that Jackson's corporations could not be held accountable for his alleged past actions. Robson and Safechuck's lawsuits were on appeal. Robson and Safechuck's allegations became the subject of the documentary Leaving Neverland released in March 2019. The documentary covered their allegations of Jackson sexually abusing them in graphic detail, saying Jackson abused them \\"hundreds of times.\\" Radio stations in New Zealand, Canada, the UK and the Netherlands removed Jackson's music from their playlists. Jackson's family condemned the film as a \\"public lynching.\\" The Jackson estate released a statement calling the film a \\"tabloid character assassination [Jackson] endured in life, and now in death\\". The film drew criticism from Jackson fans. Close associates of Jackson, such as Corey Feldman, Aaron Carter, Brett Barnes, and Macaulay Culkin, said that Jackson had not molested them. At the same time, Jackson's albums rose in the charts following the documentary. Number Ones jumped to No. 23 in the UK iTunes charts. The Essential Michael Jackson climbed to No. 76; Thriller climbed to No. 133 and Bad to No. 142. Billboard senior editor Gail Mitchell said she and a colleague interviewed about thirty music executives who believed Jackson's legacy could withstand the controversy. On February 21, 2019, the Jackson estate sued HBO for breaching a non-disparagement clause from a 1992 contract. The suit sought to compel HBO to participate in a non-confidential arbitration that could result in $100 million or more in damages rewarded to the estate. HBO said they did not breach a contract and filed an anti-SLAPP motion against the estate. On September 20, Judge George H. Wu denied HBO's motion to dismiss the case, allowing the Jackson estate to arbitrate. In the fourth quarter of 2019, some New Zealand and Canadian radio stations re-added some of Jackson's music to their playlists, citing \\"positive listener survey results\\". Legacy and influence Michael Jackson graffiti in 170x170pxJackson's Bad era wax figure at 214x214pxJackson has been referred to as the \\"King of Pop\\" because he transformed the art of music videos and paved the way for modern pop music. For much of Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger generation. His influence extended beyond the music industry; he impacted dance, led fashion trends, and raised awareness for global affairs. Jackson's music and videos fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and steered its focus from rock to pop music and R&B;, shaping the channel into a form that proved enduring. In songs such as \\"Man in the Mirror\\", \\"Black or White\\", Heal the World, \\"Earth Song\\" and \\"They Don't Care About Us\\", Jackson's music emphasized racial integration and environmentalism and protested injustice. He is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by Guinness World Records. He is considered one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. > \\"Trying to trace Michael Jackson's influence on the pop stars that followed > him is like trying to trace the influence of oxygen and gravity. So vast, > far-reaching and was his impact — particularly in the wake of Thrillers > colossal and heretofore unmatched commercial success — that there weren't a > whole lot of artists who weren't trying to mimic some of the Jackson > formula.\\" — J. Edward Keyes of Rolling Stone Danyel Smith, chief content officer of Vibe Media Group and the editor-in- chief of Vibe, described Jackson as \\"the Greatest Star\\". Steve Huey of AllMusic called him \\"an unstoppable juggernaut, possessed of all the skills to dominate the charts seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice, eye- popping dance moves, stunning musical versatility and loads of sheer star power\\". BET said Jackson was \\"quite simply the greatest entertainer of all time\\" and someone who \\"revolutionized the music video and brought dances like the moonwalk to the world. Jackson's sound, style, movement and legacy continues to inspire artists of all genres.\\" In 1984, Time pop critic Jay Cocks wrote that \\"Jackson is the biggest thing since the Beatles. He is the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley. He just may be the most popular black singer ever.\\" He described Jackson as a \\"star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style, and color too.\\" In 2003, Daily Telegraph writer Tom Utley described Jackson as \\"extremely important\\" and a \\"genius\\". In 2007, Jackson said: \\"Music has been my outlet, my gift to all of the lovers in this world. Through it, my music, I know I will live forever.\\" At Jackson's memorial service on July 7, 2009, Motown founder Berry Gordy called Jackson \\"the greatest entertainer that ever lived\\". In a June 28, 2009 Baltimore Sun article, Jill Rosen wrote that Jackson's legacy influenced fields including sound, dance, fashion, music videos and celebrity. Pop critic Robert Christgau wrote that Jackson's work from the 1970s to the early 1990s showed \\"immense originality, adaptability, and ambition\\" with \\"genius beats, hooks, arrangements, and vocals (though not lyrics)\\", music that \\"will stand forever as a reproach to the puritanical notion that pop music is slick or shallow and that's the end of it\\". During the 1990s, as Jackson lost control of his \\"troubling life\\", his music suffered and began to shape \\"an arc not merely of promise fulfilled and outlived, but of something approaching tragedy: a phenomenally ebullient child star tops himself like none before, only to transmute audibly into a lost weirdo\\". In the 2000s, Christgau wrote: \\"Jackson's obsession with fame, his grotesque life magnified by his grotesque wealth, are such an offense to rock aesthetes that the fact that he's a great musician is now often forgotten\\". Artistry =Influences= Jackson's Bad era jacket on display at the 193x193pxJackson was influenced by musicians including James Brown, Little Richard, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, and David Ruffin. Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, but Brown was his greatest inspiration; he later said that as a small child, his mother would waken him whenever Brown appeared on television. Jackson described being \\"mesmerized\\". Jackson's vocal technique was influenced by Diana Ross; his use of the oooh interjection from a young age was something Ross had used on many of her songs with the Supremes. She was a mother figure to him, and he often watched her rehearse. He said he had learned a lot from watching how she moved and sang, and that she had encouraged him to have confidence in himself. Choreographer David Winters, who met Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana!, said that Jackson watched the musical West Side Story almost every week, and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in \\"Beat It\\" and the \\"Bad\\" video. =Vocal style= Jackson sang from childhood, and over time his voice and vocal style changed. Between 1971 and 1975, his voice descended from boy soprano to high tenor. He was known for his vocal range. With the arrival of Off the Wall in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; Rolling Stone compared his vocals to the \\"breathless, dreamy stutter\\" of Stevie Wonder, and wrote that \\"Jackson's feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling falsetto that's used very daringly.\\" By the time of 1982's Thriller, Rolling Stone wrote that Jackson was singing in a \\"fully adult voice\\" that was \\"tinged by sadness\\". The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the introspective album Dangerous. The New York Times noted that on some tracks, \\"he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth\\" and he had a \\"wretched tone\\". When singing of brotherhood or self- esteem the musician would return to \\"smooth\\" vocals. Of Invincible, Rolling Stone wrote that, at 43, Jackson still performed \\"exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies\\". Joseph Vogel notes Jackson's ability to use non-verbal sounds to express emotion. Neil McCormick wrote that Jackson's unorthodox singing style \\"was original and utterly distinctive\\". =Musicianship= Jackson had no formal music training and could not read or write music notation. He is credited for playing guitar, keyboard and drums, but was not proficient in them. When composing, he recorded ideas by beatboxing and imitating instruments vocally. Describing the process, he said: \\"I'll just sing the bass part into the tape recorder. I'll take that bass lick and put the chords of the melody over the bass lick and that's what inspires the melody.\\" Engineer Robert Hoffman recalled Jackson dictating a guitar chord note by note and singing string arrangements part by part into a cassette recorder. =Themes and genres= Jackson during his Bad tour in Vienna, June 1988 Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\". With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed his maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co- wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona. In Bad, Jackson's concept of the predatory lover is seen on the rock song \\"Dirty Diana\\". The lead single \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" is a traditional love ballad, and \\"Man in the Mirror\\" is a ballad of confession and resolution. \\"Smooth Criminal\\" is an evocation of bloody assault, rape and likely murder. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine states that Dangerous presents Jackson as a paradoxical person. The first half of the record is dedicated to new jack swing, including songs like \\"Jam\\" and \\"Remember the Time\\". It was the first Jackson album in which social ills became a primary theme; \\"Why You Wanna Trip on Me\\", for example, protests world hunger, AIDS, homelessness and drugs. Dangerous contains sexually charged songs such as \\"In the Closet\\". The title track continues the theme of the predatory lover and compulsive desire. The second half includes introspective, pop-gospel anthems such as \\"Will You Be There\\", \\"Heal the World\\" and \\"Keep the Faith\\". In the ballad \\"Gone Too Soon\\", Jackson gives tribute to Ryan White and the plight of those with AIDS. HIStory creates an atmosphere of paranoia. In the new jack swing-funk rock tracks \\"Scream\\" and \\"Tabloid Junkie\\", and the R&B; ballad \\"You Are Not Alone\\", Jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels, and directs his anger at the media. In the introspective ballad \\"Stranger in Moscow\\", Jackson laments his \\"fall from grace\\"; \\"Earth Song\\", \\"Childhood\\", \\"Little Susie\\" and \\"Smile\\" are operatic pop songs. In the \\"D.S.\\", Jackson launched a verbal attack against the lawyer Tom Sneddon, who had prosecuted him in both child sexual abuse cases. He describes Sneddon as an antisocial white supremacist who wanted to \\"get my ass, dead or alive\\". Sneddon said he had not listened to the song. Invincible was produced by Rodney Jerkins. It includes urban soul tracks such as \\"Cry\\" and \\"The Lost Children\\", ballads such as \\"Speechless\\", \\"Break of Dawn\\", and \\"Butterflies\\" and mixes hip hop, pop, and R&B; in \\"2000 Watts\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Invincible\\". =Music videos and choreography= 254x254px Jackson released \\"Thriller\\", a 14-minute music video directed by John Landis, in 1983. The zombie-themed video \\"defined music videos and broke racial barriers\\" on MTV, which had launched two years earlier. Before Thriller, Jackson struggled to receive coverage on MTV, allegedly because he was African American. Pressure from CBS Records persuaded MTV to start showing \\"Billie Jean\\" and later \\"Beat It\\", which led to a lengthy partnership with Jackson, and helped other black music artists gain recognition. The popularity of his videos on MTV helped the relatively new channel's viewing figures, and MTV's focus shifted toward pop and R&B.; His performance on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever changed the scope of live stage shows, making it acceptable for artists to lip-sync to music video on stage. The choreography in Thriller has been copied in Indian films and prisons in the Philippines. Thriller marked an increase in scale for music videos, and was named the most successful music video ever by the Guinness World Records. In \\"Bad\\"'s 19-minute video—directed by Martin Scorsese—Jackson used sexual imagery and choreography, and touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Winfrey in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he said it was spontaneously compelled by the music. Time magazine described the \\"Bad\\" video as \\"infamous\\". It featured Wesley Snipes; Jackson's later videos often featured famous cameo roles. For the \\"Smooth Criminal\\" video, Jackson experimented with leaning forward at a 45 degree angle, beyond the performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe to lock the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to lean forward. They were granted for the device. The video for \\"Leave Me Alone\\" was not officially released in the US, but in 1989 was nominated for three Billboard Music Video Awards and won a Golden Lion Award for its special effects. It won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form. He received the MTV Video Vanguard Award in 1988; in 2001 the award was renamed in his honor. The \\"Black or White\\" video simultaneously premiered on November 14, 1991, in 27 countries with an estimated audience of 500 million people, the largest audience ever for a music video at the time. Along with Jackson, it featured Macaulay Culkin, Peggy Lipton, and George Wendt. It helped introduce morphing to music videos. It was controversial for scenes in which Jackson rubs his crotch, vandalizes cars, and throws a garbage can through a storefront. He apologized and removed the final scene of the video. \\"In the Closet\\" featured Naomi Campbell in a courtship dance with Jackson. \\"Remember the Time\\" was set in ancient Egypt, and featured Eddie Murphy, Iman, and Magic Johnson. The video for \\"Scream\\", directed by Mark Romanek and production designer Tom Foden, gained a record 11 MTV Video Music Award Nominations, and won \\"Best Dance Video\\", \\"Best Choreography\\", and \\"Best Art Direction\\". The song and its video are Jackson's response to being accused of child molestation in 1993. A year later, it won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form. It has been reported as the most expensive music video ever made, at $7 million; Romanek has contradicted this. The \\"Earth Song\\" video was nominated for the 1997 Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form. Michael Jackson's Ghosts, a short film written by Jackson and Stephen King and directed by Stan Winston, premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. At over 38 minutes long, it held the Guinness world record for the longest music video until 2013, when it was eclipsed by the video for the Pharrell Williams song \\"Happy\\". The 2001 video for \\"You Rock My World\\" lasts over 13 minutes, was directed by Paul Hunter, and features Chris Tucker and Marlon Brando. It won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Music Video in 2002. In December 2009, the Library of Congress selected \\"Thriller\\" as the only music video to be preserved in the National Film Registry, as a work of \\"enduring importance to American culture\\". Huey wrote that Jackson transformed the music video into an art form and a promotional tool through complex story lines, dance routines, special effects and famous cameos, while breaking down racial barriers. Honors and awards platinum certified record on display at the Hard Rock Cafe, Hollywood. As of 2017, it is certified 33× platinum.198x198px Jackson's estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide make him the best-selling pop act of all time and the third-best-selling music artist in history. He had 13 number-one singles in the US in his solo career—more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era. He was invited and honored by a President of the United States at the White House three times. In 1984, he was honored with a \\"Presidential Public Safety Commendation\\" award by Ronald Reagan for his humanitarian endeavors. In 1990, he was honored as the \\"Artist of the Decade\\" by George H. W. Bush.

He also was honored with the World Music Awards' Best-Selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium and the Bambi Pop Artist of the Millennium Award. Jackson was inducted onto the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1980 as a member of the Jacksons, and in 1984 as a solo artist. He was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Vocal Group Hall of Fame as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and again as a solo artist in 2001. In 2002 he was added to the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2010, Jackson was the first recording artist to be inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame, and in 2014 he was posthumously inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame. Jackson received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Fisk University in 1988. In 1992, he was invested as a titular king of Sanwi, a traditional kingdom located in the south-east of Ivory Coast. In July 2009, the Lunar Republic Society named a crater on the Moon after Jackson. In August, for what would have been Jackson's 51st birthday, Google dedicated their Google Doodle to him. In December, the American Film Institute recognized Jackson's death as a \\"moment of significance\\". In 2010, two university librarians found that there were references to Jackson in academic writing on music, popular culture, chemistry and other topics. On December 19, 2014, the British Council of Cultural Relations deemed Jackson's life one of the 80 most important cultural moments of the 20th century. World Vitiligo Day has been celebrated on June 25, the anniversary of Jackson's death, to raise awareness of the auto-immune disorder that Jackson suffered from. On December 29, 2009, the American Film Institute recognized Jackson's death as a \\"moment of significance\\". Earnings In 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts were estimated at $125 million. Forbes placed Jackson's annual income at $35 million in 1996 and $20 million in 1997. Estimates of Jackson's net worth during his life range from negative $285 million to positive $350 million for 2002, 2003 and 2007. Forbes reported in August 2018 that Jackson's total career pretax earnings in life and death were $4.2 billion. Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated $300 million in royalties. He may have earned another $400 million from concerts, music publishing (including his share of the Beatles catalog), endorsements, merchandising and music videos. In 2013, the executors of Jackson's estate filed a petition in the United States Tax Court as a result of a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over US federal estate taxes. The executors claim that it was worth about $7 million, the IRS that it was worth over $1.1 billion. In February 2014, the IRS reported that Jackson's estate owed $702 million; $505 million in taxes, and $197 million in penalties. A trial was held from February 6 to 24, 2017, and a decision was still pending as of 2020. In 2016, Forbes estimated annual gross earnings by the Jackson Estate at $825 million, the largest ever recorded for a celebrity, mostly due to the sale of the Sony/ATV catalog. In 2018 the figure was $400 million.

Completed in 1896, it is the oldest-standing Russian Orthodox church in Alaska and was a major center for the assimilation of the local Native population. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places shortly after. Today the church is a member of the Orthodox Church in America Diocese of Alaska and further the Kenai Deanery. History Alaska became a diocese in the Russian Orthodox Church in 1840, and the Church's popularity in the Kenai Peninsula region grew, particularly among the Kenaitze, the native people of the peninsula. Bishop Innocent created six parishes in Alaska, including one for the Kenai region. The first chapel was built that same year by the Russian-American Company near the village of Kenai within Fort St. Nicholas. The first priest to serve the parish, Igumen Nikolai Militov, arrived in 1844 and served until his death in 1869. Igumen Nikolai oversaw the construction of a church in 1849 on a different portion of the lot. He opened a school in the early 1860s, and Russian became the principal language in both education and commerce. The church served as a vital method of assimilating the natives to the Russian culture. In addition to religious and educational purposes, the church served as an administrative and judicial center for the region. Built from 1895 to 1896, the church was the second Orthodox church at the site, replacing the 1849 structure. The church was built from logs in the Pskov style, that is in the shape of a ship. The bell tower was completed later in 1900. The interior contains an elaborate iconostasis. The Chapel of St. Nicholas was built in 1906. It rests over the graves of Igumen Nikolai, his assistant and reader Makari Ivanov, and an unrecorded monk. The chapel sits on the site of the original chapel, across the street from the church, on a bluff overlooking the confluence of the Kenai River and Cook Inlet. The rectory was built in 1881 and is considered the oldest building in the Peninsula. The church site, including the rectory, cemetery, and chapel, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970. and List of priests Early on, the parish was served by priests who emigrated from Russia. From 1860, Nikolai Militov and Makary Ivanov, in whose honor the Chapel of St. Nicholas was built, traveled the region and vaccinated thousands of Dena'ina from smallpox.

In various texts, they referred to their tradition as Yuktavāda (the doctrine of logic), and another name for them was Hetuvāda.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 56, 164. The Vaibhāṣika school was an influential subgroup of the larger Sarvāstivāda school. They were distinguished from other Sarvāstivāda sub-schools like the Sautrāntika and the \\"Western Masters\\" of Gandhara and Bactria by their orthodox adherence to the doctrines found in the Mahāvibhāṣa. Vaibhāṣika thought significantly influenced the Buddhist philosophy of all major Mahayana Buddhist schools of thought and also influenced the later forms of Theravāda Abhidhamma (though to a much lesser extent).KL Dhammajoti. The Contribution of Saṃghabhadra to Our Understanding of Abhidharma Doctrines, in Bart Dessein and Weijen Teng (ed) \\"Text, History, and Philosophy Abhidharma across Buddhist Scholastic Traditions.\\" The Sarvāstivāda tradition arose in the Mauryan Empire during the second century BCE, and was possibly founded by Kātyānīputra (ca. 150 B.C.E.).Dhammajoti (2009) p. 55. During the Kushan era, the \\"Great Commentary\\" (Mahāvibhāṣa) on Abhidharma was compiled, marking the beginning of Vaibhāṣika as a proper school of thought. This tradition was well supported by Kanishka, and later spread throughout North India and Central Asia. It maintained its own canon of scriptures in Sanskrit, which included a seven-part Abhidharma Pitaka collection. Vaibhāṣika remained the most influential Buddhist school in northwest India from the first century CE until the seventh century. Despite numerous variations and doctrinal disagreements within the tradition, most Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣikas were united in their acceptance of the doctrine of \\"sarvāstitva\\" (all exists), which says that all phenomena in the three times (past, present and future) can be said to exist.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 59. Another defining Vaibhāṣika doctrine was that of simultaneous causation (sahabhū-hetu), hence their alternative name of \\"Hetuvāda\\".  Sources  Stupa of Jayendra Vihar at Ushkur (Huṣkapur) near Baramulla, Jammu and Kashmir, during excavations in 1869. Jayendra was known as great center of learning and Xuanzang is said to have studied Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma here.Lal Mani Joshi (1977). Studies in the Buddhistic Culture of India During the 7th and 8th Centuries A.D., p. 139. Motilal Banarsidass Publ. = Canonical texts = The main source of this tradition is was the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma Pitaka. The texts of the Sarvāstivādin Abhidharma Pitaka are: * Saṃgītiparyāya ('Discourses on Gathering Together'), essentially a commentary on the Samgiti- sutra (T 9, Digha-nikaya no. 33). * Dharmaskandha ('Aggregation of Dharmas'), a list of key doctrinal topics. * Prajñāptiśāstra ('Treatise on Designations'), a list of doctrinal topics followed by question and answer sections. * Dhātukāya ('Collection of Elements'), similar to the Dhātukathā, though it uses a different doctrinal list of dharmas. * Vijñānakāya ('Collection of Consciousness'), attributed to master Devasarman. It is here that the existence of all dharmas through past, present and future, is first found. * Prakaraṇapāda ('Exposition') Together, these comprise the Six Treatises (Chinese: 六足論; Sanskrit: ṣaḍ-pāda-śāstra). The seventh text is the Jñānaprasthāna ('Foundation of Knowledge'), also known as Aṣṭaskandha or Aṣṭagrantha, said to be composed by Kātyāyanīputra.Yaśomitra is said to have likened this text to the body of the above six treatises, referring to them as its legs (pādas). = Exegetical texts = The Jñānaprasthāna became the basis for Sarvastivada exegetical works called vibhāṣa, which were composed in a time of intense sectarian debate among the Sarvāstivādins in Kashmir. These compendia not only contain sutra references and reasoned arguments but also contain new doctrinal categories and positions.Willemen, Charles; Dessein, Bart; Cox, Collett. Sarvastivada Buddhist Scholasticism, Handbuch der Orientalistik. Zweite Abteilung. Indien. Brill, 1998, p. 229 The most influential of these was the Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣa Śāstra (\\"Great Commentary\\"), a massive work which became the central text of the Vaibhāṣika tradition who became the Kasmiri Sarvāstivāda Orthodoxy under the patronage of the Kushan empire.Willemen, Charles; Dessein, Bart; Cox, Collett. Sarvastivada Buddhist Scholasticism, Handbuch der Orientalistik. Zweite Abteilung. Indien. Brill, 1998, p. XII There are also two other extant Vibhasa compendia, though there is evidence for the existence of many more of these works which are now lost. The Vibhasasastra of Sitapani and the Abhidharmavibhasasastra translated by Buddhavarman c. 437 and 439 A.D. are the other extant Vibhasa works. Though some scholars claim the Mahāvibhāṣa dates to the reign of Kanishka during the first century CE, this dating is uncertain. However, we at least know it was translated into Chinese by the late 3rd or early 4th century.Willemen et al 1998, p. 148. = Treatises = In addition to the canonical Sarvāstivādan Abhidharma, a variety of expository texts or treatises were written to serve as overviews and introductions to the Abhidharma. The best known belonging to the Sarvāstivāda tradition are:Willemen, Charles; Dessein, Bart; Cox, Collett. Sarvastivada Buddhist Scholasticism, Handbuch der Orientalistik. Zweite Abteilung. Indien. Brill, 1998 * Abhidharma-hṛdaya-sastra (The Heart of Abhidharma), by the Tocharian Dharmasresthin, circa 1st. century B.C., Bactria. It is the oldest example of a systematized Sarvāstivāda treatise. * Abhidharmaāmrtaṛasa (The Taste of the Deathless) by the Tocharian Ghoṣaka, 2nd century AD, based on the above work. * Abhidharma-hṛdaya-sastra (The Heart of Abhidharma) by Upasanta, also based on Dharmasresthin's hṛdaya-sastra. * Samyuktabhidharma-hṛdaya by Dharmatrata, also based on Dharmasresthin's hṛdaya-sastra. * Abhidharmakośabhāsya (Treasury of Higher Knowledge) by Vasubandhu (4th or 5th century) – a highly influential series of verses and accompanying commentary by Vasubandhu. It often critiques Vaibhāṣika views from a Sautrantika perspective. This is the main text used to study Abhidharma in Tibet and East Asia. It remains influential in Chinese and Tibetan Buddhism. However, K.L. Dhammajoti notes that this work sometimes presents the Vaibhāṣika views unfairly. * Abhidharmakośopāyikā-ṭīkā, a commentary on the Kośa by Śamathadeva * Nyāyānusāra (Conformance to Correct Principle) by Saṃghabhadra, an attempt to criticize Vasubandhu and defend orthodox Vaibhāṣika views. * Abhidharmasamayapradīpikā, a compendium of the above by Saṃghabhadra. * Abhidharmavatara (\\"Descent into the Abhidharma\\"), an introductory treatise by master Skandhila (5th century). * Abhidharma-dipa and its auto-commentary, the Vibhasa-prabha-vrtti, a post-Saṃghabhadra Vaibhāṣika treatise which follows closely the Abhidharmakośa verses and attempts to defend Vaibhāṣika orthodoxy. The most mature and refined form of Vaibhāṣika philosophy can be seen in the work of master Saṃghabhadra (ca fifth century CE) , \\"undoubtedly one of the most brilliant Abhidharma masters in India\\". His two main works, the *Nyāyānusāra (Shun zhengli lun 順正理論) and the *Abhidharmasamayapradīpikā (Apidamo xian zong lun 阿毘達磨顯宗論), are very important sources for late Vaibhāṣika thought. His work was referenced and cited by various important figures, such as Xuanzang and Sthiramati.  Dharmas  = Dharmas and their characteristics = All Buddhist schools of Abhidharma divided up the world into \\"dharmas\\" (phenomena, factors, or \\"psycho-physical events\\"), which are the fundamental building blocks of all phenomenal experience.Ronkin, Noa, \\"Abhidharma\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2018 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). Unlike the sutras, the Abhidharma analyzes experience into these momentary psycho-physical processes. Dharmas refers to the discrete and impermanent instances of consciousness along with their intentional objects that rapidly arise and pass away in sequential streams. They are analogous to atoms, but are psycho-physical. Hence, according to Noa Ronkin, \\"all experiential events are understood as arising from the interaction of dharmas.\\" From the Vaibhāṣika perspective, \\"Abhi-dharma\\" refers to analyzing and understanding the nature of dharmas and the wisdom (prajñā) that arises from this. This systematic understanding of the Buddha's teaching was seen by Vaibhāṣikas as the highest expression of the Buddha's wisdom which was necessary to practice the Buddhist path.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 10, 16 It is seen as representing the true intention of the Buddha on the level of absolute truth (paramārtha-satya).Dhammajoti (2009) p. 16 According to the Mahāvibhāṣa, \\"abhidharma is [precisely] the analysis of the intrinsic characteristics and common characteristics of dharmas.\\" For Vaibhāṣikas, dharmas are the \\"fundamental constituents of existence\\" which are discrete and real entities (dravya).Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 8, 19. K.L. Dhammajoti states: > A dharma is defined as that which holds its intrinsic characteristic > (svalakṣaṇadhāraṇād dharmaḥ). The intrinsic characteristic of the dharma > called rūpa, for example, is the susceptibility of being molested (rūpyate), > obstructability and visibility; that of another dharma called vedanā is > sensation, etc. And for a dharma to be a dharma, its intrinsic > characteristic must be sustainable throughout time: A rūpa remains as a rūpa > irrespective of its various modalities. It can never be transformed into > another different dharma (such as vedanā). Thus, a uniquely characterizable > entity is a uniquely real (in the absolute sense) entity, having a unique > intrinsic nature (svabhāva): “To be existent as an absolute entity is to be > existent as an intrinsic characteristic (paramārthena sat svalakṣaṇena sad > ityarthaṛ).”Dhammajoti (2009) p. 19. This idea is seen in the Jñānaprasthāna which states: \\"dharmas are determined with respect to nature and characteristic ...Dharmas are determined, without being co-mingled. They abide in their intrinsic natures, and do not relinquish their intrinsic natures (T26, 923c).\\"Dhammajoti (2009) p. 8. According to Vaibhāṣikas, the svabhāvas of dharmas are those things that exist substantially (dravyasat) as opposed to those things which are made up of aggregations of dharmas and thus only have a nominal existence (prajñaptisat). This distinction is also termed the doctrine of the two truths, which holds that there is a conventional truth (saṁvṛti) that refers to things which can be further analyzed, divided or broken up into smaller constituents and an ultimate truth (paramārtha) referring to that which resists any further analysis.Siderits, Mark (2007). Buddhism as philosophy, p. 112. Thus, a dharma's intrinsic characteristic (svalakṣaṇa) and the very ontological existence of a dharma (i.e. svabhāva, \\"intrinsic nature\\", or dravya, \\"substance\\") is one and the same.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 19 For the Vaibhāṣika school, this \\"own nature\\" (svabhāva) was said to be the characteristic of a dharma that persists through the three times (past, present and future).Westerhoff, 2018, p. 70. Vaibhāṣika Abhidharma also describes dharmas as having \\"common characteristics\\" (sāmānya-lakṣaṇa), which applies to numerous dharmas (for example, impermanence applies to all material dharmas and all feelings, etc). Only the mental consciousness can cognize common characteristics.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 20. However, the intrinsic characteristics of a dharma have a certain kind of relativity due to the relationship between various dharmas. For example, all rūpa (form) dharmas have the common characteristic of resistance, but this is also an intrinsic characteristic with respect to other dharmas like vedanā (feeling).Dhammajoti (2009) p. 21. Also, various sources state that the intrinsic nature of a dharma is \\"weak\\" and that they are interdependent with other dharmas. The Mahāvibhāṣa states that \\"conditioned dharmas are weak in their intrinsic nature, they can accomplish their activities only through mutual dependence\\" and that \\"they have no sovereignty (aisvarya). They are dependent on others.\\"Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 187-188. Thus, an intrinsic nature (svabhāva) arises due to dependently originated processes or relationships between various dharmas and therefore, a svabhāva is not something which is completely ontologically independent. = Classification of dharmas = Abhidharma thought can be seen as an attempt at providing a complete account of every type of experience. Therefore an important part of Vaibhāṣika Abhidharma comprises the classification, definition and explanation of the different types of dharma as well as the analysis of conventional phenomena and how they arise from the aggregation of dharmas. Thus there is the element of dividing up things into their constituents as well as the element of synthesis, i.e. how dharmas combine to make up conventional things. The Vaibhāṣikas made use of classic early Buddhist doctrinal categories such as the five skandhas, the sense bases (ayatanas) and the \\"eighteen dhātus\\". Beginning with the Pañcavastuka of Vasumitra, the Vaibhāṣikas also adopted a five group classification of dharmas which outlined a total of 75 types of phenomena.Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 35-37. The five main classifications of dharmas are: * Rūpa (11 dharma types), refers to matter or physical phenomena/events. * Citta (1 type), refers to thought, intentional consciousness or the bare phenomenon of consciousness. Its main characteristic is cognizing an object. * Caitasikas (46 types) refers to \\"thought- concomitants\\", mental events or \\"associated mentality\\". * Cittaviprayuktasaṃskāras (14 types) refers to \\"conditionings disjoined from thought\\" or \\"factors disassociated from thought\\". This category is unique to Vaibhāṣika and not shared with other Abhidharma schools. It groups together various experiential events that are not associated with thought but are also not physical. * Asaṃskṛta dharmas (3 types) refers to the three unconditioned dharmas: space and two states of cessation (nirodha). Dharmas are also classified and divided into further taxonomical categories providing further aids to understanding the Buddhist view and path. Some of the major ways that the Vaibhāṣikas classified dharmas include the following:Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 37–43. * Skillful, wholesome or useful on the path (kuśala), unskillful (akuśala) or non-defined/non-determined (avyākṛta). Skillful dharmas generate desirable and good outcomes, unskillful ones are the opposite. Non-defined dharmas are neither good nor bad. * Saṃskṛta (conditioned, fabricated), or asaṃskṛta (unconditioned). According to the Mahāvibhāṣa, a dharma is conditioned \\"if it has arising and ceasing, cause and effect, and acquires the characteristics of the conditioned.\\" * Sāsrava (with āsravas, which are the \\"outflows\\" or mental impurities, a synonym for defilement) and anāsrava (without āsravas). * Darśana-heya are sāsrava dharmas abandonable by vision (into the four noble truths), bhāvanā-heya are sāsrava dharmas abandonable by cultivation of the Buddhist path, and aheya dharmas are anāsrava dharmas that are not to be abandoned. = Rūpa (matter) = Matter is that which is \\"subject to deterioration or disintegration.\\" As Vasubandhu says, it is what \\"is repeatedly molested/broken\\" by contact.Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 188-189. The main way of defining matter for Vaibhāṣikas is that it has two main distinctive natures: resistance (sa-pratighātatva), which is “the hindrance to the arising of another thing in its own location,” and visibility (sa- nidarśanatva), which allows one to locate matter since \\"it can be differently indicated as being here or being there\\" (Saṃghabhadra).Dhammajoti (2009), p. 190. The primary material dharmas are the four Great Elements (mahābhūta, \\"Great Reals\\") — earth (pṛthivī), water (ap), fire (tejas), air (vāyu). All other dharmas are \\"derived matter\\" (upādāya-rūpa/bhautika) which arise on the basis of the Great Realities.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 193. According to Dhammajoti: \\"The four Great Elements exist inseparably from one another, being co-existent causes (sahabhū-hetu) one to another. Nevertheless, rūpa-dharma‑s are manifested and experienced in diverse forms because of the difference in intensity or substance of one or more of the four Elements.\\"Dhammajoti (2009), p. 195. Vaibhāṣika also had a theory of atoms. However, these atoms (paramāṇu) were not seen as eternally immutable or permanent and instead are seen as momentary.Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 198-199. For Vaibhāṣika, an atom is the smallest unit of matter, which cannot be cut, broken up and has no parts. They come together (without touching each other) to form aggregations or \\"molecules\\". They held that this is \\"known through mental analysis.\\"Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 199, 205-206. = Mind and mental factors = In Vaibhāṣika Abhidharma, the mind is a real entity, which is referred to by three mostly synonymous terms: citta, manas (thinking) and vijñāna (cognition), which are sometimes seen as different functional aspects of the mind.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 211. As defined by K.L. Dhammajoti, citta \\"is the general discernment or apprehension with respect to each individual object. This discernment is the mere grasping of the object itself, without apprehending any of its particularities.\\"Dhammajoti (2009), p. 227 Saṃghabhadra defines it as what \\"grasps the characteristic of an object in a general manner.\\"Dhammajoti (2009), p. 228 Citta never arises by itself, it is always accompanied by certain mental factors or events (caittas or caitasikas), which are real and distinct dharmas that make a unique contribution to the mental process. Therefore, a moment of thought always has a specific nature and content. Cittas and caittas always arise together simultaneously in mutually dependent relationships.Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 212-213. The doctrine which said that these two always arise and operate together is called \\"conjunction\\" (saṃprayoga). What conjunction meant was a disputed topic among the early masters. Later, it came to be accepted that for citta and caittas to be conjoined, the following had to be true: both must be supported by the same basis (āśraya i.e. sense organ), they must have the same object (ālambana), mode of activity (ākāra), same time (kāla), and the same substance (dravya). This doctrine was repudiated by the Sautrāntika, who held that dharmas only arise successively, one after the other.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 225. As seen in their list of dharmas, the Vaibhāṣikas classified caittas into various sub- categories based on various qualities. For example, the first classification, the universal dharmas (mahābhūmika), are so called because they exist in all types of citta. Then there are also universal good dharmas (kuśala mahābhūmikā) and universal defilements (kleśa).Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 215-216. One of the major controversies in Abhidharma Buddhism dealt with the question of the original nature of citta. Some, like the Mahāsāṃghika, held the view that it retains an originally pure nature. Vaibhāṣikas like Saṃghabhadra rejected this view, holding that the nature of citta can also be defiled.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 234 . = Cittaviprayuktasaṃskāras = Unlike other Abhidharma schools, the Vaibhāṣikas added another ultimate classification termed citta-viprayukta-saṃskāra, “conditionings (forces) disjoined from thought.” These \\"are real entities which are neither mental nor material in nature, which yet can operate on both domains\\" and can be seen as laws of nature.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 285. Dhammajoti notes however that the Abhidharma works of other schools like the *Śāriputrābhidharma also contain this category, just not as one of the main ultimate classifications.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 286. He also notes that there was never full agreement on how many dharmas are found in this category and that the Sautrāntikas did not accept their reality. Thus it was a much debated topic in Northern Abhidharma traditions.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 291. Perhaps the most important of these conditionings are acquisition (prāpti) and non-acquisition (aprāpti). Acquisition: > Is a force that links a dharma to a particular serial continuity > (santati/santāna), i.e., the individual. Non-acquisition is another real > entity whose function and nature are just opposed to those of acquisition: > It acts to ensure that a given dharma is delinked from the individual serial > continuity...It was at a relatively later stage that acquisition came to be > defined generally as the dharma that effects the relation of any dharma to a > living being (santāna).Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 293, 296. > These conditionings are particularly important because, due to their theory of tri-temporal existence, acquisition is central to the Vaibhāṣika understanding of defilement and purification. Since a defilement is a real dharma that exists always (sarvadā asti); it cannot be destroyed, however it can be de- linked from an individual by disrupting the acquisition-series. This also helps to explain how one can obtain a pure dharma such as nirvāṇa, since it is only through acquisition that one experiences nirvāṇa.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 300. Another doctrinally important set of conditionings are \\"the four characteristics of the conditioned (saṃskṛta-lakṣaṇa).\\" Dharmas are said to have the production-characteristic (jāti-lakṣaṇa) which allows them to arise, the duration-characteristic (sthiti-lakṣaṇa) which is what enables it to temporarily remain and the decay-characteristic (jarā‑lakṣaṇa) which is the force which impairs its activity so that it can no longer continue projecting another distinct effect. A dharma also has the impermanence or disappearance characteristic (anityatā/vyayalakṣaṇa) which is what causes it to enter into the past.Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 306-307. = Asaṃskṛta (the unconditioned) = Unconditioned dharmas are those which exist without being dependently co- arisen (pratītya-samutpanna), they are also not temporal or spatial. They transcend arising and ceasing, and are real existents that possess a unique efficacy (though not a temporal causal efficacy like other dharmas).Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 472-474. The Vaibhāṣika school taught three types of unconditioned dharmas: space (ākāśa), cessation through deliberation (pratisaṃkhyā-nirodha), and cessation independent of deliberation (apratisaṃkhyā-nirodha).Dhammajoti (2009), p. 471. In the MVŚ, some disagreement among Sarvāstivāda masters regarding these dharmas can be seen. Some like \\"the Bhadanta\\" (Dharmatrāta) denied the reality of space. Meanwhile, Dārṣṭāntikas denied the ontological reality of all three.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 473. According to Dhammajoti, cessation through deliberation refers to \\"the cessation of defilements acquired through the process of discriminative or deliberative effort.\\" There are just as many of these cessations as there are with-outflow dharmas. Cessation independent of deliberation meanwhile \\"are those acquired simply on account of the deficiency in the required assemblage of conditions for the particular dharma‑s. They are so called because they are independent of any deliberative effort.\\" There are as many of these cessations are there are conditioned dharmas. Cessation through deliberation is also the technical term for the Buddhist goal of nirvāṇa, which is also defined as \\"a disjunction (visaṃyoga) from with-outflow dharma‑s acquired through the process of discrimination/deliberation (pratisaṃkhyāna) which is a specific outflow-free prajñā.\\"Dhammajoti (2009), p. 474. Nirvāṇa is the absolute absence of karma and the defilements, the escape from the skandhas and all saṃsāric existence which attained by an arhat.Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 275-476.  Nirvāṇa's real existence  In Sarvāstivāda, nirvāṇa is a \\"distinct positive entity\\" (dravyāntara). It is \\"an ontologically real force that is acquired by the practitioner when a given defilement is completely abandoned.\\" This force ensures that the defilement's acquisition will never arise again. Master Skandhila’s definition indicates how this real entity has a positive presence, which is said to be \\"like a dike holding back the water or a screen blocking the wind.\\"Dhammajoti (2009), p. 476. Vaibhāṣika holds that the real existence of nirvāṇa is supported both by direct perception and by scripture which depict the Buddha stating that \\"there is definitely the unborn.\\"Dhammajoti (2009), p. 477. Sautrāntikas disagree with this interpretation of scripture, holding that the unborn simply refers to the discontinuity of birth (janmāpravṛtti), and thus it is a mere concept referring to the absence of suffering due to the abandoning of the defilements and thus it is only relatively real (prajñaptisat). However, Saṃghabhadra argues that \\"it is only when the unborn is conceded to be a distinct real entity that it is meaningful to say 'there is'. Besides, if there were no such entity, the Buddha should have simply said 'there is the discontinuity of the born.'\\"Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 483. According to Vaibhāṣika, nirvāṇa must be an ultimately real existent because no real supporting phenomena can be found which could serve as the basis on which to designate nirvāṇa as a relative existent (as the aggregates serve to designate the self as relative, for example).Dhammajoti (2009), p. 278. Also, if nirvāṇa is not a real force, then beings could not give rise to delight in nirvāṇa and disgust towards saṃsāra, for nirvāṇa would be inferior in terms of existence. It would also mean that the Buddha had been deluding everyone by speaking of non-existents in the same way that he spoke of the existents.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 479. Furthermore, if nirvāṇa was unreal, it could not be one of the four noble truths, since a non-existent cannot be said to be true or false. An ārya is said to directly see the four truths, including the third truth of duḥkhanirodha (the end of suffering, i.e. nirvāṇa) and wisdom cannot arise with regard to a non-existent object.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 480.  Time and Ontology  = Existence = The name Sarvāstivāda literally means \\"all exists\\" (sarvām asti), referring to their doctrine that all dharmas, past present and future, exist.Westerhoff, 2018, p. 61. This doctrine of tri-temporal existence has been described as an eternalist theory of time.Kalupahana, David; A history of Buddhist philosophy, continuities and discontinuities, page 128. What does it mean for a dharma to exist? For the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharmikas, the main reasons that something is real or existent is causal efficacy and the fact that it abides in its own nature (svabhāva).Dhammajoti (2009), p. 65. The Vaibhāṣika philosopher Saṃghabhadra defines an existent as follows: \\"The characteristic of a real existent is that it serves as an object-domain for generating cognition (buddhi).\\"Dhammajoti (2009), p. 69. Each cognition is intentional and it has a distinctive character which is caused by the intrinsic characteristic (svalakṣaṇa) of the object of cognition. If there is no object of cognition (viṣaya), there is no cognition.Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 72-73. Furthermore, according to Saṃghabhadra, only if there are true existent forms can there be a difference between correct and incorrect cognitions regarding material things.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 73. Saṃghabhadra further adds that they are of two types of existents: > What exists truly (dravyato’sti) and what exists conceptually > (prajñaptito’sti), the two being designated on the basis of conventional > truth and absolute truth. If, with regard to a thing, a cognition (buddhi) > is produced without depending on anything else, this thing exists truly — > e.g., rūpa, vedanā, etc. If it depends on other things to produce a > cognition, then it exists conceptually/relatively — e.g., a vase, army, > etc.Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 69-70. Furthermore, things that truly exist are also of two types: those things that just have their own nature and those things that have both their own nature and also have activities (kāritra). Additionally, this last type is divided into two: \\"with or without function (sāmarthya/vyāpara/śakti).\\" Lastly, relative existents are also of two types, \\"having existence on the basis of something real or on something relative, like a vase and an army, respectively.\\" = Arguments in favor of temporal eternalism = According to Jan Westerhoff, one reason they had for holding this theory was that moments of consciousness are intentional (are directed, \\"about something\\") and thus if there are no past entities which exist, thoughts about them would be objectless and could not exist.Westerhoff, 2018, p. 62. Another argument is that to account for past actions (karma) which have effects at a later time. If an act of karma no longer exists, it is difficult, argues the Vaibhāṣika, to see how they can have fruits in the present or future. Finally, past, present and future are mutually interdependent ideas. If past and future are non-existent, argued the Vaibhāṣikas, how can one make sense of the existence of the present? In the Samyukta-abhidharma-hrdaya, a fourth century Gandharan Sarvāstivāda text, the core Sarvāstivāda theory is defended thus: Vasubandhu outlines the main arguments based on scripture and reason for all exists as follows:Dhammajoti (2009), p. 63. * a. For, it has been said by the Buddha: “O bhikṣus, if past rūpa did not exist, the learned noble disciple could not have become disgusted with regard to the past rūpa. It is because past rūpa exists that the learned noble disciple becomes disgusted with regard to the past rūpa. If future rūpa did not exist, the learned noble disciple could not have become free from delight with regard to the future rūpa. It is because future rūpa exists that…” * b. It has been said by the Buddha, “Conditioned by the two [— sense organ and the object —], there is the arising of consciousness…” * c. Consciousness arises when there is an object, not when there is no object. This is a fixed principle. If past and future [dharma‑s] were non- existent, there would be a consciousness having a non-existent object. Hence, in the absence of an object, consciousness itself would not exist. * d. If past [dharma‑s] were non-existent, how could there be in the future the fruit of pure or impure karma? For it is not the case that at the time of the arising of the fruit a present retribution-cause exists! =Temporality= Regarding time (adhvan), for Vaibhāṣikas, it is just a superimposition on the activity of these different types of dharmas and does not exist independently.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 119. Because of this, there was a need to explain how one experiences time and change. Among the different Sarvāstivāda thinkers, there were different ideas on how dharmas change so as to give rise to the experience of time. The Mahāvibhāṣa (MVŚ) speaks of four major theories which attempt to do this: * The theory which says there is a change in mode of being (bhāva-anyathātva). * The theory which says there is a change in characteristic (lakṣaṇa-anyathātva). * The theory which says there is a change in state or condition (avasthā-anyathātva). * The theory which says there is a change in [temporal] relativity (anyathā-anyathātva). The positions are further outlined by Vasubandhu as follows:Poussin; Pruden, Abhidharmakosabhasyam of Vasubandhu, Vol 3, 1991, p. 808. # \\"The Bhadanta Dharmatrata defends change in mode of being, that is, he affirms that the three time periods, past, present, and future, are differentiated by their non-identity of existence (bhava). When a dharma goes from one time period to another its nature is not modified, but its existence is.\\" # \\"The Bhadanta Ghosaka defends change in characteristic, that is, the time periods differ through the difference in their characteristics. A dharma goes through the time periods. When it is past, it is endowed with past characteristics (laksana), but it is not deprived of its present and future characteristics...\\" [and so on with present and future] # \\"The Bhadanta Vasumitra defends change in state/condition, that is, the time periods differ through the difference of condition (avastha). A dharma, going through the time periods, having taken up a certain condition, becomes different through the difference of its condition, not through a difference in its substance. Example: a token placed on the square of ones, is called one; placed on the square of tens, ten; and placed on the square of hundreds, one hundred.\\" #\\"The Bhadanta Buddhadeva defends change in [temporal] relativity, that is, the time periods are established through their mutual relationships. A dharma, going throughout the time periods, takes different names through different relationships, that is, it is called past, future, or present, through a relationship with what precedes and with what follows. For example, the same woman is both a daughter and a mother.\\" In the Abhidharmakośa, Vasubandhu argues that \\"the best system is that of Vasumitra\\".Poussin; Pruden, Abhidharmakosabhasyam of Vasubandhu, Vol 3, 1991, p. 810. The Samyukta- abhidharma-hrdaya agrees.Charles Willemen, Bart Dessein and Collett Cox; Sarvāstivāda Buddhist Scholasticism, p 23. Later Sarvāstivāda developed a combination of the first and third views. This can be seen in Saṃghabhadra, who argues that while a dharma's essential nature does not change, its function or activity (kāritra) and its existence (bhāva) changes: > The essential nature of a dharma remains eternally; its bhāva [existence] > changes: When a saṃskṛta [conditioned] dharma traverses through adhvan > [time], it gives rise to its kāritra [activity] in accordance with the > pratyaya-s [conditions], without abandoning its substantial nature; > immediately after this, the kāritra produced ceases. Hence it is said that > the svabhāva exists eternally and yet it is not permanent, since its bhāva > changes.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 123. Thus, for Saṃghabhadra, \\"a dharma is present when it exercises its kāritra, future when its kāritra is not yet exercised, past when it has been exercised.\\"Dhammajoti (2009) p. 126. The term kāritra is defined as \\"a dharma’s capability of inducing the production of its own next moment.\\"Dhammajoti (2009) p. 129. When the right set of conditions come together, a dharma becomes endowed with activity (which vanishes in a single moment). When it does not have activity, a dharma's own nature still has the capacity to causally contribute to other dharmas.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 130-133. = Svabhāva in time = Regarding the essential nature (svabhāva) or reality (dravya) of a dharma, all Vaibhāṣika thinkers agreed that it is what remains constant and does not change as a dharma moves throughout the three times. However, as noted by K.L. Dhammajoti, this does not necessarily mean that a dharma's svabhāva \\"is immutable or even permanent, for a dharma’s mode of existence and its essential nature are not different, so that when the former is undergoing transformation, so is its svabhāva.\\" From the Vaibhāṣika perspective this is not a contradiction, since it is the same process that remains (even while changing) throughout time. Thus, in this particular sense, there is no change in the svabhāva or svalakṣaṇa. This is said to be the case even though a dharma is always being transformed into different modes of being. Each of these is actually a new occasion or event in a causal stream (though it is not different in terms of its nature than previous dharmas in that stream).Dhammajoti (2009) p. 135 Thus according to K.L. Dhammajoti, there is a way in which the essential natures are transformed, and yet, one can say that they remain the same ontologically. Dharmatrāta used the example of a piece of gold that is transformed into different things (cups, bowl, etc). While there are different entities, the essential nature of gold remains the same. This perspective is expressed by Saṃghabhadra who argues that svabhāva is not permanent since it goes through time and its existence (bhāva) varies through time. Saṃghabhadra also notes that a dharma is produced by various causes (and is part of a causal web which has no beginning), and once a dharma has ceased, it does not arise again. However, for Saṃghabhadra, one can still say that dharmas do not lose their svabhāva. He uses the example of vedanās (sensation). Even though we speak of various modes of sensation, all the types of sensation in a person's mindstream have the same nature of being sensitive phenomena (prasāda rūpa). Saṃghabhadra then states: > It is not the case that since the function is different from the existence, > that there can be the difference in the functions of seeing, hearing, etc. > Rather, the very function of seeing, etc., is none other than the existence > of the eye, etc. On account of the difference in function, there is > definitely the difference in the mode of existence… Since it is observed > that there are dharma‑s that co-exist as essential substances and whose > essential characteristics do not differ but that [nevertheless] have > different modes of existence, we know that when dharma‑s traverse the three > times, their modes of existence vary while their essential characteristics > do not change. He also states: > [Our explanations] also have properly refuted the objection that [our theory > of sarvāstitva] implies the permanence of [a dharma’s] essential nature, > for, while the essential nature remains always [the same], its avasthā > [condition] differs [in the stages of time] since there is change. This > difference of avasthā is produced on account of conditions and necessarily > stays no more than one kṣaṇa [moment]. Accordingly, the essential nature of > the dharma too is impermanent, since it is not distinct from the difference > [that arises in it]. [But] it is only in an existent dharma that changes can > obtain; there cannot be change in a non-existent. In this way, therefore, we > have properly established the times.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 136. According to K.L. Dhammajoti, what the Vaibhāṣikas had in mind with this view was that even though the different dharmas in a causal series are different entities, there is an overall \\"individuality or integrity\\", and the series thus remains \\"dynamically identical.\\" This is a relationship of identity-in- difference (bhedābheda). In this sense, a svabhāva is not a static entity, it is impermanent and undergoes change and yet \\"ontologically it never becomes a totally different substance.\\"Dhammajoti (2009) p. 137. Saṃghabhadra claimed that it is only when understood in this way that the doctrine of \\"all exists\\" is logically compatible with the doctrine of impermanence. =Momentariness= Orthodox Sarvāstivāda also defended the theory of moments (kṣaṇavada). This doctrine held that dharmas last only for a moment, this measure of time is the smallest measure of time possible, it is described in the Samyukta-abhidharma- hrdaya as:  Theory of Causality  An important topic covered in Vaibhāṣika Abhidharma was the investigation of causes, conditions and their effects. Vaibhāṣikas used two major schemes to explain causality: the four conditions (pratyaya) and the six causes (hetu).Dhammajoti (2009) p. 143. In this system, the arising of dharmas is totally dependent on specific causes. Causal force is what makes a dharma real and thus they are also called saṃskāras (conditioning forces). Because of this, all dharmas belong to some kind of causal category, and are said to have causal efficacy.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 146. Indeed, it is only through examining their causes that the intrinsic nature manifests in a cognizable way. In the Vaibhāṣika system, the activities of dharmas arises through the mutual interdependence of causes. Thus, their intrinsic natures are said to be \\"feeble\\", which means they are not able to act on their own, and their activity is dependent on other dharmas.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 148-149. A particularly unique feature of the Vaibhāṣika system is their acceptance of simultaneous causation. These \\"co-existent causes\\" are an important part of the Sarvāstivāda understanding of causality. It allowed them to explain their theory of direct realism, that is to say, their affirmation that we perceive real external objects. It also was used in their defense of temporal eternalism. Thus, it was central to their understanding of cause and effect. For thinkers like Saṃghabhadra, a sense organ and its object must exist at the same moment together with its effect, the perception. Thus, for a cause to be efficacious, it must exist together with its effect.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 162-163. This view of simultaneous causation was rejected by the Sautrāntikas, but later adopted by the Yogācāra school. = The Six Causes = *Efficient cause (kāraṇa-hetu). According to Dhammajoti, \\"It is any dharma that either directly or indirectly — by not hindering — contributes to the arising of another dharma.\\" Vasubandhu defines it as: \\"A conditioned dharma has all dharma‑s, excepting itself, as its efficient cause, for, as regards its arising, [these dharma‑s] abide in the state of non-obstructiveness.\\" This is type of cause is rejected by Sautrāntikas like Śrīlāta.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 149-150. *Homogeneous cause (sabhāga-hetu). This refers to the kind of causality in which an effect is of the same moral type as the previous cause in a series. Thus, in the series c1 → c2 → c3, if c1 is skillful, it is the homogenous cause for c2 which is also skillful, and so on. According to Vaibhāṣika, this form of causality exists among mental and material dharmas, but Sautrāntikas deny that it can apply to material dharmas.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 150. *Universal cause (sarvatraga-hetu). This is similar to the homogeneous cause in that it is a cause that produces the same kind of effect, however, it only applies to defiled dharmas. Another way it is distinct from the homogeneous is that there is \\"no necessary homogeneity in terms of category of abandonability.\\" This is because, as Saṃghabhadra says in the Nyāyānusāra, \\"they are the cause of [defiled dharma‑s] belonging to other categories as well, for, through their power, defilements belonging to categories different from theirs are produced.\\"Dhammajoti (2009) p. 152. *Retribution cause (vipāka-hetu). This is the skill or unskillful dharmas that are karmic causes, and thus lead to good or bad karmic retribution.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 153. For Vaibhāṣikas, retribution causes and their fruits comprise all five aggregates. Sautrāntikas held that retribution cause is only volition (cetanā), and retribution fruit comprises only sensation (vedanā).Dhammajoti (2009) p. 153. *Co-existent cause (sahabhū-hetu). This is a new causal category developed by Sarvāstivāda. The Mahāvibhāṣa states that the intrinsic nature of the co- existent cause is \\"all the conditioned dharma‑s.\\" Saṃghabhadra's Nyāyānusāra states that this refers to those causes \\"that are reciprocally virile effects, on account of the fact that they can arise by virtue of mutual support … For example: the four Great Elements are co-existent cause mutually among themselves … for it is only when the four different kinds of Great Elements assemble together that they can be efficacious in producing the derived matter (upādāya rūpa)... In this way, the whole of the conditioned, where applicable (i.e., where a mutual causal relationship obtains) are co‑existent causes.\\"Dhammajoti (2009) p. 155. Another sense in which they are co-existent is because they come together to produce a common effect, they function together as causes at the time of the arising of a dharma.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 159-161. *Conjoined cause (saṃprayuktaka-hetu). This refers to co-existent causes in the mental domain of citta-caittas. According to Saṃghabhadra: \\"This [conjoined] cause is established because thought and thought concomitants, being conjoined, accomplish the same deed by grasping the same object.\\"Dhammajoti (2009) p. 156. = The Four Conditions = Saṃghabhadra argues that even though the arising of dharmas depends on numerous conditions, the Buddha taught only four conditions in the sutras. Against the Sautrāntikas, who held that these were mere conceptual designations, Vaibhāṣikas assert that they are real existents.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 171. The four conditions are first found in Devaśarman’s Vijñānakāya (ca. 1st C.E.) and they are:Dhammajoti (2009) p. 169-175. *Condition qua cause (hetu-pratyaya). According to Dhammajoti, \\"This is the condition in its capacity as direct cause in the production of an effect — it is the cause functioning as the condition.\\" This condition subsumes all causes, except the efficient cause. *Equal-immediate condition (samanantara-pratyaya). This refers to a mental process (a citta or caitta) that is a condition for the arising of the next mental process. Dhammajoti: \\"It both gives way to and induces the arising of the next citta-caitta in the series.\\" For Vaibhāṣikas, this does not apply to matter, but Sautrāntikas argued that it does. *Condition qua object (ālambana- pratyaya). This refers to the fact that cognition cannot arise without an object and thus \\"in this sense, the object serves as a condition for the cognition.\\" Since the mind can take any object, \\"the condition qua object is none otherthan the totality of dharma‑s (Saṃghabhadra).\\" *Condition of dominance (adhipati-pratyaya). Dhammajoti defines it thus: \\"This is the most comprehensive or generic condition, corresponding to efficient cause: It is whatever serves as a condition, either in the sense of directly contributing to the arising of a dharma, or indirectly through not hindering its arising. From the latter perspective, the unconditioned dharma‑s — although transcending space and time altogether — are also said to serve as conditions of dominance.\\" = Five Fruits = The Sarvāstivāda also taught that there are five fruits i.e. causal effects:Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 177-183. * Disconnection fruit (visaṃyogaphala). This refers to disconnection from the defilements, and is acquired through the practice of the noble path which leads to the acquisition of the dharma \\"cessation through deliberation\\" (pratisaṃkhyā- nirodha). * Virile fruit (puruṣakāra-phala). This is related to the co- existent cause and the conjoined cause. According to Vasubandhu it is \\"That which is the activity or efficacy (kāritra) of a dharma; [so called] because it is like a virile action.\\" * Fruit of dominance (adhipati-phala). This is the most generic fruit, they are produced by efficient causes. According to Dhammajoti, \\"the fruits commonly shared by a collection of beings by virtue of their collective karma‑s belong to this category. Thus, the whole universe with all its planets, mountains and oceans, etc., is the result — the fruit of dominance — of the collective karma‑s of the totality of beings inhabiting therein.\\" * Uniform-emanation fruit (niṣyanda-phala). This is a fruit issued from a cause of a similar nature, it is correlated to the homogeneous cause and the universal cause. * Retribution fruit (vipāka-phala). This fruit only deals with individual sentient beings (sattvākhya), and is correlated with the retribution cause.  Epistemology  The Vaibhāṣika epistemology defended a form of realism that is established through experience. Their theory of knowledge held that one could know dharmas as unique forces with unique characteristics by two means of knowledge (pramāṇa): direct perception (which includes spiritual vision) or inference (anumāna), which relies on direct experience.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 242. For Vaibhāṣikas like Saṃghabhadra “the characteristic of an existent (sal-lakṣaṇa) is that it can serve as an object producing cognition (buddhi)”. Because of this, an object of knowledge is necessarily existent, though it can be either a true existent (dravyata) or a conceptual existent (prajñapti). As Dhammajoti notes, \\"the possibility of knowing an object necessarily implies the true ontological status of the object.\\"Dhammajoti (2009) p. 267. This view was rejected by Sautrāntikas like Śrīlāta, who argued that a cognitive object could be unreal, pointing to examples such as optical illusions, dreams, the false cognition of a self or really existent person (pudgala), and so on. The Vaibhāṣika response to this is that even in the case of such mistaken cognitive constructs, there is a real basis which acts as part of the causal process. As explained by Dhammajoti: > An absolute non-existent (atyantam asad) has no function whatsoever and > hence can never engender a consciousness. Thus, in the case of the > perception of the unreal pudgala, the perceptual object is not the pudgala > which is superimposed, but the five skandha‑s which are real > existents.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 268. Furthermore, as noted by Dhammajoti: \\"sensory perception as a pratyakṣa experience is fully accomplished only in the second moment on recollection.\\" This is because the external object must first be experienced by \\"direct perception supported by a sense faculty\\" (indriyāśrita-pratyakṣa) before a discerning perception (buddhi-pratyakṣa) can arise, since the discerning perception uses the previous sense faculty perception as a cognitive support (ālambana).Dhammajoti (2009) p. 277. Vaibhāṣika defended the real existence of external objects by arguing that mental defilements arise in different ways because of the causal force of the mind's intentional object. Likewise, sensory perception (pratyakṣa) is said to arise due to various causes and conditions, one of which is a real external object.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 243. According to Dhammajoti, for Vaibhāṣikas like Saṃghabhadra, \\"a sensory consciousness necessarily takes a physical assemblage or agglomeration of atoms (he ji 和集; *saṃcaya, *saṃghāta, *samasta). What is directly perceived is just these atoms assembled together in a certain manner, not a conceptualized object such as a jug, etc.\\" For Vaibhāṣika knowledge (jñāna) is a caitta (mental factor) that has the distinguishing characteristic of being \\"understanding that is decisive or definite (niścita)\\". There are various kinds of knowledge, for example, dharma-knowledge (dharma-jñāna), is the knowledge that realizes the true nature of dharmas, conventional-knowledge (saṃvṛti-jñāna) deals with conventional (not ultimate) things and knowledge of non-arising (anutpāda-jñāna) refers to the knowledge one has when one knows nirvana has been achieved.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 247-249.  Defilement (kleśa)  The goal of Buddhism is often seen as the freedom from suffering which arises from the complete removal of all defilements (kleśa). This is a state of perfection that is known by an arhat or Buddha through the \\"knowledge of the destruction of the outflows\\" (āsravakṣaya-jñāna). Ābhidharmikas saw the Abhidharma itself, which in the highest sense is just wisdom (prajñā), as the only means to end the defilements.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 322. Kleśa is commonly defined as that which \\"soils\\" or defiles as well as that which disturbs and afflicts a psycho-physical series.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 324. Another important synonym for defilement is anuśaya, which is explained by Vaibhāṣikas as a subtle or fine (aṇu) dharma that adheres and grows with an object, \\"like the adherence of dust on a wet garment or the growth of seeds in an irrigated field\\".Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 325, 344. This is in contrast to other interpretations of anuśaya, such as that of the Sautrāntikas, who saw them as \\"seeds\\" (bīja) of kleśas. Thus, for Vaibhāṣikas there is no such thing as a latent defilement.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 341. The defilements are seen as the root of existence (mūlaṃ bhavasya), since they produce karma, which in turn leads to further rebirths.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 325. The most fundamental defilements are known as the three unskillful roots (akuśala-mūla), referring to greed (rāga), hostility (pratigha) and ignorance (avidyā).Dhammajoti (2009) p. 334. Out of these, ignorance is the most fundamental of all. It is defined by Saṃghabhadra as \\"a distinct dharma which harms the capability of understanding (prajñā). It is the cause of topsy-turvy views and obstructs the examination of merits and faults. With regard to dharma-s to be known it operates in the mode of disinclination, veiling the thought and thoughtconcomitants.\\"Dhammajoti (2009) p. 335. According to Dhammajoti, other major terms used to describe defilements are: 1. fetter (saṃyojana); 2. bondage (bandhana); 3. envelopment (paryavasthāna); 4. outflow (āsrava); 5. flood (ogha); 6. yoke (yoga); 7. clinging (upādāna); 8. corporeal tie (kāya- grantha); 9. hindrance (nivaraṇa).Dhammajoti (2009) p. 326. These numerous categories are used to describe various doctrinal topics and create a taxonomy of dharmas. For example, all dharmas are either with or without outflows (āsrava), which are dharmas that keep sentient beings flowing on through existence and also cause impurities to flow through the sense fields.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 327. These are also further divided into sub- categories. For example, there are three āsrava types: sensuality-outflow (kāmāsrava), existence-outflow (bhavāsrava) and ignorance-outflow (avidyāsrava); there are four clingings: sensuality-clinging (kāmopādāna), view-clinging (dṛṣṭy-upādāna), clinging to abstentions and vows (śīlavratopādāna), and Soul-theory-clinging (ātmavādopādāna); and there are five hindrances: (i) sensual-desire, (ii) malice, (iii) torpor-drowsiness (styāna-middha), (iv) restlessness-remorse (auddhatyakaukṛtya), and (v) doubt.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 327-329. For Vaibhāṣikas, the elimination of the defilements thus begins with an investigation into the nature of dharmas (dharma-pravicaya). This examination is carried out in various ways, such as investigating how defilements arise and grow, what its cognitive objects are, and whether a defilement is to be abandoned by insight into the four noble truths (darśanapraheya) or by cultivation (bhāvanāpraheya).Dhammajoti (2009) p. 331. In the Vaibhāṣika system, the abandonment of a defilement is not the complete destruction of it, since all dharmas exist throughout the three times. Instead, one becomes defiled when the dharma of acquisition links one with the defilement (saṃyoga), and one abandons the defilement when there is both the ceasing of the dharma of acquisition as well as the arising of the acquisition of disconnection (visaṃyoga-prāpti).Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 345-347. While the abandonment of a dharma happens at once and is not repeated, the acquisition of disconnection can take place over and over again, reflecting deeper and firmer spiritual progress.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 347. This is important because as Dhammajoti notes, Vaibhāṣikas affirm that \\"freedom from duḥkha must be gained by gradually and systematically abandoning the defilements\\" and reject the view that awakening happens abruptly.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 352. There are four methods of abandoning a defilement, the first three deal with abandonment by insight (darśana-heya):Dhammajoti (2009) p. 353. # ālambana-parijñāna: Complete understanding of the nature of the object due to which the defilement arises. # tadālambana-saṃkṣaya: The destruction of a defilement which is the object of another defilement along with the destruction of the latter (the subject). # ālambana-prahāṇa: The abandonment of a defilement that takes as object another defilement by abandoning the latter — the object. # pratipakṣodaya: The abandonment of a defilement on account of the arising of its counteragent. This is specifically applied to the defilements that are abandoned by cultivation (bhāvanā-heya).  Karma  While the Vaibhāṣikas acknowledge the profound and ultimately inconceivable nature of karma, they still attempted to give a rational account of its basic workings and to show how it was a middle way between determinism and absolute freedom.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 369-370. The Mahāvibhāṣa (MVŚ) notes that there are different but related ways in which the term karma is used. It can refer to actions in a general sense and it can refer specifically to ethical actions which have desirable or undesirable effects.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 370. Karma is also used to refer to the actual retribution causes (vipāka‑hetu) of actions, which according to Dhammajoti, play a crucial role \\"in determining the various spheres (dhātu), planes (gati) and modes of birth (yoni) of a sentient being’s existence and in differentiating the various types of persons (pudgala) with their various life-span, physical appearances, social status, etc.\\"Dhammajoti (2009) p. 370. It is also important to note that, karma is not the only contributing factor to rebirth, as Vasubandhu states: \\"It is not karma alone which is the projector of a birth (janman).\\" Karma is also related to the defilements since the defilements act as the generating cause and supporting condition for karma.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 374. = Classifications = There are three main types of karma: bodily, vocal and mental.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 371. Out of all the different elements of karma, it is the volitional aspect (abhisam-√kṛ, cetanā), which comprises all mental karma, that is the most central and fundamental, since it is originates and assists the other types of karma.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 370-371. Saṃghabhadra, citing the sutras, states that volition (i.e. mental karma) is karma \\"in the proper or specific sense inasmuch as it is the prominent cause (*viśiṣṭa-hetu) in projecting a sentient existence.\\"Dhammajoti (2009) p. 372. The Vaibhāṣikas also had further classifications of the different types of karma. For example, there are:Dhammajoti (2009) p. 374. * Volitional karma (cetanā) and karma subsequent to willing (cetayitvā); *Informative (vijñapti) and non‑informative (avijñapti) karma. This refers to bodily and vocal actions which inform others of the corresponding mental state. * Skillful (kuśala), unskillful (akuśala) and morally neutral (avyākṛta) karmas. * Karmas which are with-outflow (sāsrava) and outflow-free (anāsrava) karmas. *Determinate (niyata) and indeterminate (aniyata) karma. *Karma that is done (kṛta) and karma that is accumulated (upacita). *Projecting (ākṣepaka) and completing (paripūraka) karmas. The informative and non-informative category is particularly important. For the Vaibhāṣika, both types are real entities and are included as cetayitvā karma. Also, the nature of informative karma is material, it is the specific bodily shape at the time of the accomplishment of an action (which includes sound). Saṃghabhadra defends this by arguing that if all karma is mere volition (as held by Sautrāntika), then as soon as one has the intention to kill, this is the same as committing the deed.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 377. Vaibhāṣikas also held that non-informative karma was a kind of subtle \\"non-resistant\\" matter which preserved karmic efficacy, a view that was vigorously attacked by the Sautrāntikas.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 379-381, 392. Like other Buddhist schools, the Vaibhāṣikas taught the ten paths of karma as a major ethical guide to what should be avoided and what should be cultivated. It should be emphasized that volition remains the core of this teaching, that is, even if one avoids acting on one's harmful intentions, the intention itself remains an unskillful karma.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 386. = Karma through time = The Vaibhāṣika theory of karma is also closely related to their theory of tri-temporal existence, since karmas also exist in the past and in the future. Indeed, the efficacy of past karma is part of their argument for \\"all exists\\", since, for the Vaibhāṣika, if a past karmic retributive cause ceases to exist completely, it cannot lead to the karmic effect or fruit.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 385 As Dhammajoti explains: > At the very moment when a retributive cause arises, it determines the causal > connection with the fruit-to-be; i.e., ‘it grasps the fruit’. At a > subsequent time, when the necessary conditions obtain, it, although past, > can causally actualize the fruit by dragging it, as it were, out of the > future into the present; i.e., ‘it gives the fruit’.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. > 389-390. This was of course rejected by the Sautrāntikas, who posited a competing theory, known as the theory of seeds, which held that a volition creates a chain of momentary dharmas called seeds, which are continuously transmitted in the mind stream until they sprout, producing the karmic effect.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 390. Saṃghabhadra critiques this theory by pointing out that when a seed turns into a plant, there is no interruption in the process. But in the Sautrāntika view, there can be an interruption, as when a person has thoughts of a different ethical type or when they enter into meditations that completely interrupt mental activity (such as asaṃjñi-samāpatti or nirodha- samāpatti). And since Sautrāntikas are presentists, the past karma has also ceased to exist at this point and thus cannot be a cause for its fruit.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 391. = Karmic retribution = In Vaibhāṣika Abhidharma, the nature of karmic retribution, i.e. how a person experiences the results of their actions, is not fixed and depends on different conditions, such as the spiritual status and wisdom of the person. There are six factors that effect the gravity of karmic retribution (and subsequently, how bad one's future rebirth is):Dhammajoti (2009) p. 410. * The actions performed after the major karmic act. * The status of the ‘field’ (kṣetra- viśeṣa), referring to the ethical and spiritual status of the person. * The basis (adhiṣṭhāna), which is the act itself. * The preparatory action (prayoga) leading up to the main act. * Volition (cetanā), the intentional mental force behind the act. * The strength of the intention (āśaya-viśeṣa). There are also said to be some karmas that may or may not lead to retribution at all, these are indeterminate (aniyata) karmas which are contrasted with determinate karmas, i.e. those that necessarily cause retribution (whether in this life, in the next or in some further life).Dhammajoti (2009) p. 411. These indeterminate karmas can be rendered weak or fruitless through the practice of the spiritual path. The \\"Salt-simile sutra\\" (Loṇa-phala-sutta) is cited in support of this. Determinate karmas are particularly dark acts, such as killing one's parents, which cannot be so transformed. Another important distinction here is that between karma that is done (kṛta) which refers to preparatory and principal actions, and karma that is accumulated (upacita) which refers to the consecutive actions which \\"complete\\" the action. For example, one may prepare to kill someone and attempt to do so, but fail. In this sense, the action is not accumulated. Also, an action not done intentionally is not accumulated. Though the preparation is still a bad karma, it is not necessarily retributive. If however, something willed and accomplished is necessarily retributive.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 414. Yet another key distinction is that between projecting (ākṣepaka) and completing (paripūraka) karmas. A projecting karma is a single act which is the principal cause that projects one's future existence (as well as for the intermediate existence, the antarā-bhava), while completing karmas are responsible for specific experiences within that one existence, such as lifespan.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 417. Finally, it is important to note that in this system, karma is primarily individual. That is to say, one person's karma will not cause a retribution fruit to be experienced by another person.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 425. However, there is a karmic fruit which is experienced by a collective of individuals, which is the fruit of dominance (adhipati-phala), which affects the vitality and durability of external things, such as plants and planets. This is used to explain how, when persons do good actions, the external world is affected by the \\"four increases\\": \\"of lifespan, of sentient beings, of external items of utility and enjoyment (pariṣkāra), and of skillful dharma‑s.\\" In this sense then, there is \\"collective karma.\\" Thus, for the Vaibhāṣikas, the whole universe is the collective karma (i.e. the fruit of dominance) of all beings living in it.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 426.  Dependent Origination  The Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma interpretation of the key Buddhist doctrine of Dependent Origination (pratītya-samutpāda) focuses on how the 12 links (nidāna) contribute to rebirth from the perspective of three periods of existence (past, present, future). This is explained in the following way:Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 418-419. * _Past causes_ 1. ignorance (avidyā), represents all the defilements in one's past life, since all defilements are conjoined with and caused by ignorance. 2. conditionings (saṃskāra), this refers to all past karmic constructions driven by ignorance. * _Present effects_  3. consciousness (vijñāna), this specifically refers to the consciousness that enters the womb at the moment of rebirth.  4. psycho- physical complex (nāma-rūpa), represents the body and mind, particularly as it develops in the womb  5. six sense fields (ṣaḍāyatana), refers to the five senses and the mental sense  6. contact (sparśa), refers to contact between the sense faculties and their objects  7. sensation (vedanā), refers to different pleasant, unpleasant and neutral sensations * _Present causes_  8. craving (tṛṣṇā), craving for sensuality, desire for material things and sex  9. grasping (upādāna), strong clinging for the objects of craving  10. existence (bhava), refers to all present karmas that project a future existence * _Future effects_  11. birth (jāti), represents the first re- linking consciousness in a future birth  12. old-age-and-death (jarā- maraṇa), represents everything that happens from future rebirth until death. Though presented in a linear way in the form of a list, these factors are said to be mutually conditioning among each other in various interconnected ways. Though the three life model, also called \\"prolonged\\" (prākarṣika), is the most widely used way of understanding dependent origination, Sarvāstivāda Abhidharmikas also accepted three other ways of explaining it:Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 420-422. * Momentary (kṣaṇika): the 12 links are explained as being present within a single mind moment. * Pertaining to states (āvasthika): This model states that the five aggregates are present in each of the 12 links. Each link is so named because it is the predominant force among the aggregates at that moment, and thus the entire collection of aggregates is given the name ignorance (and so on) at that point in time. * Connected (sāṃbandhika): Refers to how the 12 links are conjoined with the entire field of causes and effects, i.e. \\"all conditioned dharmas\\" or the whole of phenomenal existence.  Spiritual path  The study of the nature and function of spiritual paths is important to Abhidharma. For the Vaibhāṣikas the spiritual path is a gradual process of abandoning the defilements; there is no \\"sudden enlightenment\\".Dhammajoti (2009) p. 433. The analysis of the various spiritual paths provided by the Vaibhāṣika Abhidharma correspond to the abandoning of various defilements. The beginning of the path consists of preliminary practices: approaching \\"true persons\\", listening to the Dharma, contemplating the meaning and practicing the Dharma and what accords with the Dharma.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 345. Preparatory practices also include the observance of the ethical precepts (śīlaṃ pālayati), giving, and studying the Abhidharma.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 436–438. The Mahāvibhāṣa (MVŚ) contains the following succinct explanation of the stages leading up to stream entry: > At the beginning, because of his aspiration for the fruit of liberation, he > diligently practices [i] giving (dāna) and the pure precepts (śīla); [ii] > the understanding derived from listening, the contemplation of the impure, > mindfulness of breathing and the foundations of mindfulness > (smṛtyupasthāna); and [iii] warmth, summits,receptivities and the supreme > mundane dharma‑s; and [then he enters into] [iv] the 15 moments of the path > of vision. This is collectively said to be “firmly on one’s feet”.Dhammajoti > (2009) pp. 436–437. = Stages of the path = Vaibhāṣika developed an influential outline of the path to awakening, one which was later adapted and modified by the scholars of the Mahayana tradition into the schema of the \\"five paths\\" (pañcamārga):Watanabe, Chikafumi (2000), A Study of Mahayanasamgraha III: The Relation of Practical Theories and Philosophical Theories. Ph.D. dissertation, The University of Calgary, pp. 38–40.Losangsamten, Introduction to the Buddhist PathWatanabe, Chikafumi, A Study of Mahayanasamgraha III: The Relation of Practical Theories and Philosophical Theories, 2000, pp. 40–65. The original Vaibhāṣika schema is divided into seven stages of preparatory effort (prayoga) and four stages of spiritual fruits (phala):Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 440–449. _The Seven prayogas_ : * Mokṣabhāgīya (\\"conducing to liberation\\") refers to meditations which are causes for liberation, mainly calm and insight. These are not completely separate and can exist together in the same thought. They are also said to constitute the wisdom (prajñā) derived from cultivation. These are outlined as follows:  Śamatha (calming meditation) practices, mainly contemplation on the impure (aśubha-bhāvanā) and mindfulness of breathing (ānāpānasmṛti), but also includes other meditations such as loving kindness (maitrī).  Vipaśyana (insight meditation), consisting of the fourfold application of mindfulness (smṛtyupasthānas) practiced one at a time, contemplating how they are impure, unsatisfactory, impermanent and without a Self.  In a more advanced stage of vipaśyana, one meditates on the four smṛtyupasthānas at the same time. * Nirvedhabhāgīya (\\"conducing to penetration\\") refers to the \\"four skillful roots\\" (kuśalamūla) of the arising of out-flow free knowledge. It thus refers to that which leads stream entry, the first noble (ārya) stage of liberation. They are said to be the wisdom derived from reflection. Each one serves as a cause for the next one:  Uṣmagata (warmth) is the initial arising of \\"the warmth of the noble knowledge capable of burning the fuels of defilements\\" (MVŚ). This is a lengthy stage, where one gradually accumulates wisdom through study, contemplation and meditation on the Dharma, especially the 16 aspects of the four noble truths. At this point, one may still retrogress.  Mūrdhan (summits). One continues to contemplate the 16 modes of the four noble truths, but at the highest level of excellence, their \\"summit\\" or \\"peak\\". At this point, one may still retrogress.  Kṣānti (receptivities) is the stage of the highest level of receptivity or acceptance of the four noble truths. One is so receptive to them that one can no longer retrogress from accepting them. There are various receptivities covering the sense sphere as well as the upper spheres of existence.  Laukikāgradharma (supreme mundane dharmas). These dharmas contemplate the unsatisfactoriness of the sphere of sensuality and refer to those dharmas that are a condition for the arising of the darśana-mārga (path of vision). _The four phala:_ Each has two stages, the candidacy stage and the fruit stage. * Srotaāpatti (stream-enterer).  The candidate for the fruit of stream-entry (srotaāpatti-phalapratipannaka), also known as the darśana-mārga (path of vision).  The “abider in the fruit of stream entry” (srotaāpatti- phala-stha). At this point, one has entered the bhāvanā-mārga (path of cultivation), where one gradually eliminates all the remaining defilements. * Sakṛdāgāmin (once returner), both stages fall within the bhāvanā-mārga. * Anāgāmin (non-returner), both stages also fall within the bhāvanā-mārga. * Arhat. Its candidacy stage is part of the bhāvanā-mārga, but the phala stage is known as aśaikṣa-mārga (path of no more learning). In the prayoga stages, the contemplation of the four noble truths was done with knowledge that are with-outflow (sāsrava). Immediately after the last prayoga stage, one is able to access outflow-free knowledges (anāsrava-jñāna), and must apply these to the noble truths. This is known as direct realization (abhisamaya), direct spiritual insight into the intrinsic and common characteristics of the four truths. This takes 16 thought moments.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 451–454. Insight into the truths is achieved in two moments called \\"paths\\". Dhammajoti explains them as follows: > In the first moment, called the unhindered path (ānantarya-mārga), the > outflow-free understanding that arises is called a receptivity (kṣānti) to > knowledge, and with this, the defilements abandonable by vision into the > particular truth are abandoned. In the following moment, called the path of > liberation (vimukti-mārga), knowledge proper arises through the induction of > which the acquisition (prāpti) of the cessation through deliberation > (pratisaṃkhyā-nirodha) of the defilements arises. In this way, for the whole > contemplative process covering the sphere of sensuality followed by the two > upper spheres, there arise eight receptivities and eight knowledges, all > being prajñā in their intrinsic nature.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 451–452. From the first moment of insight, which is the first moment of receptivitity, one is said to be an ārya, a noble being. This is because the out-flow free path has arisen in them and thus they are no longer an ordinary worldling (pṛthagjanatva).Dhammajoti (2009) p. 457. Also, according to this system, when one has entered into stream entry, there is no no going back, no retrogression.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 460. Regarding arhatship, some arhats can retrogress, mainly those who, due to their weak faculties, entered the path as a \\"pursuer through faith\\" (śraddhānusārin). Those who have sharp faculties and have studied and understood the teachings (dharmānusārins) are not retrogressible, they are ‘ones liberated through wisdom’ (prajñā- vimukta).Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 458, 464. = The three vehicles and noble beings = The Vaibhāṣika Sarvāstivādins are known to have employed schema of the Three Vehicles, which can be seen in the Mahāvibhāṣā: # Śrāvakayāna – The vehicle of the disciples, who reach the attainment of an Arhat. # Pratyekabuddhayāna – The vehicle of the \\"Solitary Buddhas\\". # Bodhisattvayāna – The vehicle of the beings who are training to become a fully enlightened buddha (samyaksambuddha). The Vaibhāṣikas held that though arhats have been fully liberated through the removal of all defilements, their wisdom (prajñā) is not fully perfected and thus inferior to a Buddha's wisdom.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 256. Also, arhats have subtle traces (vāsanā) that the defilements have left behind after they have been abandoned.Dhammajoti (2009) p. 357. Thus, for Vaibhāṣikas, arhats are said to have a certain non-defiled ignorance (akliṣṭājñāna), which Buddhas lack. Furthermore, a Buddha has both omniscience (sarvajñā) and ‘wisdom of all modes’ (sarva‑ākāra‑jñāna), i.e. a knowledge of all the spiritual paths.Dhammajoti (2009) pp. 256–257. The inferiority of the arhat attainment can be seen in texts such as the Sarvāstivādin Nāgadatta Sūtra, which critiques the Mahīśāsaka view of women in a narrative about a bhikṣuṇī named Nāgadatta. Here, the demon Māra takes the form of her father, and tries to convince her to work toward the lower stage of an arhat. Nāgadatta rejects this, saying, \\"A Buddha's wisdom is like empty space of the ten-quarters, which can enlighten innumerable people. But an Arhat's wisdom is inferior.\\" However, against the docetic view of the Mahāsāṃghikas, the Sarvāstivādins viewed the Buddha's physical body (Skt. rūpakāya) as being impure and improper for taking refuge in, and they instead regarded taking refuge in the Buddha as taking refuge in bodhi itself (awakening) and also in the Dharmakāya (body of the teaching). The Sarvāstivādins also admitted the path of a bodhisattva as a valid one. References to the bodhisattva path and the practice of the six pāramitās are commonly found in Sarvāstivāda works.Baruah, Bibhuti. Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism. 2008. p. 456 The Mahāvibhāṣā of the Vaibhāṣika Sarvāstivādins includes a schema of four pāramitās: generosity (dāna), discipline (śīla), energy (vīrya), and wisdom (prajñā), and it says that the four pāramitās and six pāramitās are essentially equivalent (seeing patience as a kind of discipline and meditation as a kind of intuitive wisdom).

It had been intended to sell it for the price of a mid-range automobile. The Junior had two problems which brought production to a halt: its three-cylinder Szekely SR-3 radial engine tended to throw its cylinders, made more serious by the pusher configuration; and the unexpected location of the propeller caused accidents to people walking up to the plane on the ground. Some Juniors were still being flown in 2012. Design and production Designed as a minimalist, affordable aircraft, the Junior was marketed as \\"built to sell for the price of an automobile in the medium price class\\". Curtiss-Robertson's plans to produce such an aircraft were driven by the imminent arrival of the Aeronca C-2 and American Eagle Eaglet on the market. Hoping to compete in the same class, the company purchased the rights to the Snyder Buzzard but soon discovered that it simply could not be made to perform well enough. To replace it, the Skeeter was produced as an all-new design that retained the Buzzard's basic configuration. The aircraft featured a fuselage of square cross-section made from steel tube covered in fabric. The top of the fuselage was left open to create an open cockpit for the pilot and a passenger sitting in tandem. The tiny pusher engine was mounted to the upper surface of a parasol wing. The undercarriage was of the fixed, tailwheel type. By the time the aircraft was ready to market in 1931, Curtiss-Robertson's parent company, Curtiss, had merged into Curtiss-Wright, and the Skeeter was awarded the new designation and name CW-1 Junior. Sales were brisk through 1931, with some 270 aircraft sold at $1,490 each, but the success did not last long. The pusher propeller arrangement was the source of two serious problems. First, the chosen powerplant, the three-cylinder Szekely SR-3 radial engine had a noted tendency to throw cylinders. In the pusher design, this resulted in the cylinder passing through the propeller. While Junior owners solved this problem by wrapping a steel cable around the engine so that any thrown cylinder would stay in place until the aircraft was safely on the ground (some sources imply that the steel cable was also added to dampen engine vibrations, and thus reduce the failure rate), the second problem was not so easily solved. The Junior's low stance on the ground and the presence of a propeller in a position where people were not used to finding one led to a number of accidents where people on the ground (particularly passengers disembarking the aircraft) simply walked into the spinning propeller. These issues, combined with a highly publicised fatal crash, spelled the end of the Junior's marketability. By early 1932, sales had virtually stopped, and Curtiss- Wright's head office decided to end production. Operational history Curtiss-Wright Junior at the Udvar Hazy Center Several Juniors were still flown by private pilot owners in 2012. A number of Juniors are preserved as museum aircraft, some in flying condition. Collections containing an examples include the National Air and Space Museum, Fantasy of Flight, Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome, Yesterday's Flyers and the Pioneer Flight Museum. The Pioneer flight museum's example is one of a few experimentally fitted with the French Salmson AD-9 radial engine. The fuel tank on this example is cone shaped.

It was demobilized and reduced to the brigade in July, 1936, but again mobilized 15 April 1939, under the \\"19th Infantry Division Venezia\\" name. The only difference between line infantry divisions and mountain infantry divisions was that the latter's artillery was carried by pack mules instead of the standard horse-drawn carriages. Italy's real mountain warfare divisions were the six alpine divisions manned by the \\"Alpini\\" mountain troops. In October–November 1943, it has gradually get transformed into the partisan Garibaldi division fighting together with Yugoslav Partisans against Axis.http://www.regioesercito.it/reparti/fanteria/rediv19.htm History =Second Italo-Ethiopian War= The Gavinana division was staying in Eritrea near Ethiopian border in the Adi Quala and Enda-Ghergis. 3 October 1935, it crossed Mareb River as part of the Italian II Corps, thus beginning the invasion. On that day, it crushed an Ethiopian fortified position at De’āro Teklē. 4 October 1935, the Gavinana division have captured the Ādī Ābun town, and 6 October 1935, has captured an important road junction at Adwa town. The advance than largely stopped, as several battles were fought around Adwa, particularly at Inda Mīka’ēl to the south of the town. After the eventual Ethiopian counter-attack was stalled, the Gavinana division has participated in the Second Battle of Tembien, starting from 26 February 1936 an attack around Shire, Ethiopia. 2 March 1936 it destroyed a large Ethiopian formation near Mai Nebri, Eritrea, and 3 March 1936 was in pursuit of shattered Ethiopian troops along the Tacazze River, returning to Inda Silasē near Shire, Ethiopia 4 March 1936. 5–7 March 1936, it reached Indabaguna town. 9 March 1936, the Gavinana division have occupied Debarq, and 2 April 1936, have stopped at Dabat. It was relieved from the front-line duties 22 April 1936 and sent to Axum. For the rest of war, it participated in mopping-up operations around Mendefera. =Occupation of Albania= The reformed \\"Venezia\\" division was mobilized for the occupation of Albania, landing in Durrës during 25–30 April 1939. It was responsible for the cities of Elbasan and Pogradec. =Greco-Italian War= Coat of Arms of the 83rd Infantry Regiment \\"Venezia\\", 1939 10 June 1940, the Venezia division was close to Yugoslavian border in the valley of Drin, the Bulqizë and southern shores of Debar lake. 26 October 1940, it got the orders to transfer to the Greek border to Korçë area. 2 November 1940, the Venezia division was relocated to the south of Lake Prespa to parry an anticipated Greek attack. Its defence stretched along Zaroshkë- Bilisht-Kapshticë line. 3 November 1940, the Greek forces have attacked the division right flank. Although the Venezia division initially held the position, during 4–5 November 1940, it was pushed out of Kapshticë, Bilisht and Bitincke towns, falling back to the Devoll river. Consequently, Greek have shifted the focus of their attacks on centre and left (northern) flank of the Venezia division, but without much success despite heavy fighting 8–15 November 1940. Meanwhile, the Venezia division was outflanked on south by Greek breakthrough to Ersekë 16 November 1940. It tried to rectify the frontline by pulling out the southern flank from the Devoll river valley, while Greek intensified their attacks on retreating Italians 17–19 November 1940. 21 November 1940, the contact with neighbour Italian forces on the south flank was lost, as the division had made a stand at the Pogradec–Buçimas–Bregu i Zervaskës line on southern tip of Lake Ohrid. The Greek resumed their attacks 26 November 1940, but the Venezia division have started to retreat to Shkumbin river valley only 29 November 1940, after again being outflanked from the right. Rearguard have fought a fierce delaying battle 1–7 December 1940, in the outskirts of the city of Pogradec and southern shores of Lake Ohrid, from Kalasë to as far to south as pass of Qafa e Vashës. The outstretched southern flank of Venezia division was retreating to the north, but rapid Greek advance have resulted in some elements of the division being stranded by 9 December 1940 on mountaintop of \\"Breshenihcut\\" surrounded by Greek forces until being rescued 23–24 December 1940. At the beginning of the 1941, the division was reinforced by the 72nd blackshirts militia legion (regiment). Despite the reinforcement and severe weather, the division positions continued to crumble, resulting in failure of the \\"Kungullit\\" mount defences 7 January 1941. Unexpectedly, it was a last major loss for the Venezia division, as the fighting intensity had begun to decrease during January–March, 1941. 7 April 1941 was recorded a last Greek attack on Qafa e Vashës. 14 April 1941, the Italian forces began a general offensive. The Venezia division have participated by advancing first to Pogradec, and than turned south to Maliq and Korçë, capturing it 15 April 1941, without meeting a severe resistance. 18 April 1941, the Venezia division have reached Ersekë =Operations in Yugoslavia= In July, 1941, the Venezia division was transferred to the Montenegro coast near Shkodër, quartering in city of Podgorica, and towns of Berane and Kolašin Municipality. It was tasked with mopping-up and anti- partisan fighting. In 1942, the division was reinforced by 383rd infantry regiment and continue to operate in the same area. In 1943, the partisans encroachment on the city of Podgorica become apparent, resulting in more fighting. The cooperation with the Chetniks have saved the Venezia division from severe losses. Transformation to the Garibaldi brigades With the onset of the Armistice of Cassibile 9 September 1943, the 118th Jäger Division (Wehrmacht) and soon Chetniks have demanded the Venezia division to disarm, but were refused as division command was able to consolidate the forces and maintain discipline. But cooperation with Chetniks have deepened from early October, 1943, resulting in fights against Germans starting from 13 October 1943. The area of fighting included Berane, Kolašin Municipality, Brodarevo, and Murina, Montenegro (Murino). During these battles, the division was reorganized into the 6 brigades, from Venezia I to Venezia VI. Further reorganization happened 1 December 1943, resulting in 3 brigades: Garibaldi II, Garibaldi III and Garibaldi IV, with some additions from the other Italian units. Garibaldi I is mostly unrelated brigade, despite some personnel flow to it.

Vasey (February 28, 1822 – March 4, 1893) was an English-born American botanist who collected a lot in Illinois before integrating the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), where he became Chief Botanist and curator of the greatly expanded National Herbarium. Biography George Vasey was born in 1822 in Snainton near Scarborough, England, the fourth of ten children. His family emigrated to the United States the next year, and they established in Oriskany, New York. He left school at 12 to take a job as a store clerk. He took interest in botany after borrowing and, since he could not afford the volume, manually copying a book on the subject. This interest was later encouraged after a chance encounter with Peter D. Knieskern, another naturalist who allowed Vasey to begin writing to various other botanists. Until 1870 he would maintain an extensive correspondence and collect a great many specimens both in Oneida County and later McHenry County, but did not publish material of scientific relevance until the 1870s. Vasey married Martha Jane Scott in 1846, having graduated the same year from Berkshire Medical Institute with a M.D. degree, and shortly after they moved to establish themselves in Ringwood, Illinois. In 1854 he opened a dry good store to support his family of 7: four children and his mother. In 1858 he was a founding member of the Illinois Natural History Society, and over the next few years, began writing prolifically for the society and the Prairie Farmer. He had two more children by 1861, but in 1864 he lost his youngest to whooping cough. When his wife began to grow weaker, Vasey relocated the family to Richview, to no avail. Martha Vasey died in 1866. After a brief period where he stopped writing, he remarried to a widow, but was beset with heavy financial trouble by the time John Wesley Powell invited him to participate in an expedition in 1868. Greatly enthused by the adventure, he dedicated himself to scientific pursuit. He briefly edited Entomologist and Botanist before being curator of the Illinois State University Natural History Museum. He resigned the latter position to succeed Charles Christopher Parry as the USDA Chief Botanist. He quickly began work to improve the poor state of the National Herbarium, then organized an exhibit of the country's trees for the Centennial Exposition. The herbarium, hosted by the Smithsonian Institution, is considered the crowning of his career, particularly its grass collection, of which he was a specialist; in 1889 the Institute named him Honorary Curator. As Chief Botanist he launched the Contributions from the United States National Herbarium. With George Thurber he worked on grasses for Asa Gray and John Torrey's Flora of North America. He was granted an honorary M.A. in 1864 from Illinois Wesleyan University. In 1869 he was made a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and in 1892, of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; that same year he was representative to the 1892 International Botanical Congress in Genoa, where he was a Vice- President. Of his published work his several-volumes monograph of the United States grass, the last part of which was published after his death, is one of the most notable, as are his 1884 Agricultural Grasses of the United States and his work to describe unpublished species who had accumulated in the herbarium, a work he completed less than a week before his death in 1893, from peritonitis. Three genera (Vaseya, now part of Muhlenbergia, Vaseyochloa, and Vaseyanthus), as well as numerous species were named after him, although it is not always clear whether they are named after himself or his son, George Richard Vasey, who collected widely after his father entered the USDA, and after which Rhododendron vaseyi is most likely named.

Biography Roosevelt in Westward Bound Roosevelt was born as Kenneth Stanhope Sanderson in Meeker in Rio Blanco County in northwestern Colorado. He was an athlete and a cowboy in his youth. He started performing as a stuntman in 1916, his first work being on the film Hell's Hinges. He continued working as a stuntman as well as an actor throughout his long Hollywood career. Roosevelt served in the United States Navy during World War I. Although it has been said that he served aboard the USS Norfolk, and that it was sunk during that war, no record of a USS Norfolk being in service during World War I has been found. After World War I, Roosevelt returned to Hollywood to perform stunts in films as notable as The Sheik, the 1921 movie classic starring Rudolph Valentino and for which Valentino would become most remembered. Roosevelt's first acting role was in the 1924 film Down in Texas. He would star in thirty-seven films from 1924 to 1929, most of which were western films. He made a successful transition to \\"talking films\\", mainly because of his abilities as a stuntman. In 1930, he appeared alongside William Haines and Leila Hyams in Way Out West, which continued him on the path of western film roles, mostly in Poverty Row films but he also made small or uncredited appearances in major films. During the 1930s he appeared in 66 films—some in which he both acted and did stunt work—almost all being westerns, and appeared with such notable actors and actresses as Harry Carey, Hoot Gibson, Gloria Stuart, Joel McCrea, Edward G. Robinson, Bette Davis, and Humphrey Bogart. He also was a frequent stand in for Ronald Colman beginning with Clive of India (1935).p. 28 Days Best Hollywood Story Toronto Blade 3 June 1942 In 1939 he both performed stunts and had a minor role in the Claire Trevor-John Wayne classic Stagecoach, and in 1940 he appeared, uncredited, again with John Wayne in The Man from Dakota, in which he also performed stunts. Throughout the 1940s he both appeared in or performed stunts in 32 films, most notably alongside Randolph Scott and Lloyd Bridges in Abilene Town. During World War II he interrupted his film career by enlisting in the U.S. Coast Guard.http://www.rioblancocounty.org/hometown-kenneth-sanderson- becomes-buddy-roosevelt-in-the-movies/ In the 1950s, he appeared in sixty-five episodes as an unnamed townsman on the ABC/Desilu television series, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, with Hugh O'Brian in the title role. Jimmy Noel appeared similarly in 144 episodes of the same series. From 1950 through 1962 he appeared in or perform stunts in thirty-six films and two television series. In 1957 he appeared uncredited as a Townsman in The Lonely Man. He retired after 1962 with his last appearance being uncredited in the John Wayne and James Stewart film The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. He returned home to Meeker, Colorado, where he was living at the time of his death on October 6, 1973, at the age of seventy-five.

It is one of the most important discoveries in this area, competing only with Ekven, Russia. It is the type site for the Ipiutak culture, which arose possibly as early as 100–200 BCE and collapsed around 800 CE. The Ipiutak culture occurred from south of the Bering Strait, across the Brooks Range and possibly as far north as Point Barrow. The Ipiutak site was discovered in 1939 by archaeologists Helge Larsen and Froelich Rainey, who completed a monograph on the site in 1948. The site consists of nearly 600 abandoned house depressions along four beach ridges that impart a linearity that was originally interpreted as purposeful design as roads or \\"avenues.\\" Many of the houses are too close to be contemporaneous and the range of several radiocarbon ages suggests a duration of 300–400 years to build all of the houses. Archaeologists have modeled the population history of the site to infer that only about 125–200 people lived at the site during any one generation and occupied 20 to 30 houses. The original population estimates of over 4000 are in error. Excavations in 1940 and 1941 produced sizable collections from 74 square driftwood constructed houses and over 120 burials, now archived within three museums: the National Museum of Denmark, the American Museum of Natural History and the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The site is renowned for its mortuary offerings, one of which is termed a \\"mask.\\" One Point Hope Ipiutak mask represents a human face with a gaping mouth and blowfly larvae issuing from its nostrils; a symbol pregnant with shamanistic meaning. A very similar \\"maskoid\\" is reported from Deering, that is dated between 600 and 800 CE. A variety of open work ivory carvings, engraved with iron burins, are renowned for their figurative representations that include polar bears, loons, seals, and (rarely) humans. Ipiutak houses contain evidence of military and craft specialization in working walrus tusk, while a number of graves show evidence of violence associated with warfare. Two technological hallmarks of Ipiutak culture are its very finely crafted stone tools used in arrow points and its lack of ceramics. The Ipiutak culture is defined by a distinctive linear, circle and dot aesthetic, that closely resembles the Old Bering Sea culture, which is restricted to Bering Strait and adjacent Siberia. Ipiutak is contemporaneous with the later phases of Old Bering Sea and very likely had had political, economic and social ties with it. The original excavators, Larsen and Rainey, linked the Ipiutak open work animal carving style with the distant and Scthyo-Siberian cultures of the Ukraine, but little data support this supposition. Instead, Ipiutak closely resembles the widespread pan Alaska Norton culture, which did use ceramics and relied on salmon fishing. The subsistence basis of Ipiutak was sea mammal hunting, most importantly of ringed seal and walrus, although caribou hunting was also crucial. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961 and was added to the National Register of Historical Places in 1966. Several other sites have also been linked to Ipiutak: at Cape Krusenstern, Itivlik Lake, Hahanudan Lake, Feniak Lake, Onion Portage Archeological District, and Anaktuvuk Pass, Alaska. The culture is noted for the elaborateness of its artwork, which seems to be an ancestor of Inuit art. It is still unclear why the Ipiutak apparently did not hunt whale or make pottery, considering that they lived in highly developed settlements.Helge Larsen and Froelich Rainey, Ipiutak and the Arctic Whale-Hunting Culture, Anthropological Paper 42, American Museum of Natural History, New York, 1948.Douglas D.

These have diesel engines of 2.8 and 3.6 litres respectively. These engines were later upgraded to more powerful, cleaner units. A much larger (53 seats) rear-engined bus called Journey K appeared in 1972 and was replaced by the Isuzu Erga Mio in 1999.

Geography The town lies west of Le Puy-en-Velay. History A former stronghold of the Gévaudan, Saugues grew in the 12th century under the authority of the Bishops of Mende and the Lords of Mercœur. A fire in 1788 destroyed most of the town's historical centre. It is in the mountains around and near Saugues that the famous beast of Gévaudan is said to have originated. =The Pilgrimage to Compostela= Saugues is situated on the Via Podiensis, a variant route of the Way of St. James pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Pilgrims arrive in the town from Monistrol-d'Allier, and continue to the next communes of Chanaleilles, La Dômerie du Sauvage and La Chapelle Saint-Roch. Saugues was the traditional meeting point for pilgrims coming from Auvergne, as the path coming from Brioude made them able to avoid Le Puy-en-Velay and instead wind though the Allier River valley through Langeac, Chanteuges and Pourcheresse forest, connecting them to the secondary tracks that took pilgrims from Cantal and Puy-de-Dôme. =The Confraternity of Penitents= The Confrérie des Pénitents, or the Confraternity of Penitents, was founded in Saugues on 14 May 1652, with the permission of the Monseigneur of Marcillac and under the leadership of five of the town's nobles; Lord of Courère Antoine de Langlade, Lord of Valletta Jacques de Langlade, both canons of the local collegiate church of Saint Médard, the Royal Notary Jacques de Langlade, the bourgeois Benoît Paparic, and the apothecary Antoine Pichot. The confraternity was officially recognised by a bull from the Archconfraternity of the Gonfalone in Rome. Population Sights Famous for its woodturning of \\"esclops\\" (clogs), Saugues is rich in old houses and dominated by La Tour des Anglais, a square keep dating back to the 13th century.

She is the youngest daughter of the well known composer Saint-Preux. In France she became well known in 2000 while singing with Johnny Hallyday and later with Jean-Baptiste Maunier. In 2007 she got international attention by raising enough financial support on Sellaband. In 2011 she obtained a small role in the movie Perfect Baby as Amy.  Biography  The daughter of composer Saint Preux and a painter/author mother, Clémence, from a young age, grew up in an artistic world, making it only natural for her to turn towards music and singing early in her life, learning piano and guitar and taking lessons in dance and comedy. When she was 12 years of age, the young girl met Johnny Hallyday. Enchanted by her voice, he recorded the song On a tous besoin d'amour with her. The song garnered great success in France (it attained 4th place on the top 50 in November 2001). Nevertheless, she had to wait until 2005 to be recognized at the fore of the music scene. That year, she took part in a duet with Jean-Baptiste Maunier – who had also then just made his glowing debut with the success of Les Choristes – releasing the single Concerto pour deux voix. The song, which compares itself more to a vocal exercise because of the absence of words, is an adaptation of Concerto pour une Voix (Concerto for One Voice), composed by Saint Preux in 1969. The success was once more that of a partnership, however, and at the end of 2005, Clémence released a solo single, Sans défense (Without Defense), followed by La vie comme elle vient the following year. On 18 March 2007, Clémence became the fourth artist to reach a grand total of $50,000 in \\"parts\\" sold on Sellaband, thereby allowing her to start recording an album. Her first album, entitled Mes Jours (My Days), was recorded to follow directly after and scheduled to appear in shops in France on the 12 December 2007. Clémence wrote three of the fourteen songs on the disc herself. She has starred a film called Perfect Baby, starring Jean-Baptiste Maunier, Deng Chao and Jane March. Clémence married Joachim Lellouche in March 2017.

That season Pitino guided the Gophers to an 11-7 record in the Big Ten, which was Minnesota's most wins in conference in 20 years. On March 21, 2019, in the first round of the 2019 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, No. 10 Minnesota faced No. 7 seed Louisville, a school he previously helped coach and a program which his father Rick had been head coach of for 16 years. Minnesota defeated the Cardinals 86–76 to move on to the Round of 32. In the Round of 32, the Gophers lost to #2 Michigan State 70-50.

It is used primarily for assessing concrete that is too fluid (workable) to be measured using the slump test, because the concrete will not retain its shape when the cone is removed. Application When fresh concrete is delivered to a site by a truck mixer, its consistency needs to be checked before it is poured into formwork. If consistency is not at the desired level, concrete will not have the required strength and other qualities once it has set. If concrete is too pasty, cavities may form within it.

He was also a physician and co-founder of Western Reserve University's Medical School, as well as what would become the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.

Kirtland was born in Wallingford, Connecticut. His mother was Mary, daughter of Dr. Jared Potter, a famous physician of Wallingford. His father, Turhand Kirtland, was largely interested in the purchases made by the Connecticut Land Company in Ohio, and moved to the Western Reserve in 1803. In the meantime the son remained in Wallingford. When Potter died in 1810, he left a legacy to provide for Jared's medical education at Edinburgh. But the War of 1812 with Great Britain prevented the voyage, and when the Yale School of Medicine went into operation in 1813, Kirtland was the first matriculated student in a class of 38 members. He was married in May, 1814, to Caroline, second daughter of Joshua Atwater, of Wallingford, and after graduation in 1815 he practiced in Wallingford until 1818, when he made a journey to Ohio to perfect arrangements for a removal thither. But on returning for his family he found a peculiarly attractive opportunity for establishing himself in Durham, Conn., and there remained until the death of his wife in 1823, when he carried out his intention of settling in Poland, Ohio. He had acquired a large country practice, and had also been for three terms a member of the legislature, when in 1837 he was elected to the professorship of the theory and practice of medicine in the Ohio Medical College at Cincinnati. He resigned this position in 1842, having in the meantime purchased a fine fruit farm in East Rockport, five miles from the city of Cleveland, where he spent the rest of his life. In 1843 the medical department of the Western Reserve College was established, at Cleveland, and he filled the chair of theory and practice in that institution until 1864. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855. Besides his professional attainments, Dr. Kirtland was interested in all departments of natural history. He was an efficient assistant in the first geological survey of Ohio, and was untiring in his efforts to improve the horticulture and agriculture of his adopted state. He died at his residence in East Rockport, Dec. 11, 1877, aged 84 years. Shortly alter the death of his first wife he was married to Hannah F. Toucey, of Newtown, Conn. Of three children by his first marriage, one daughter survived him.

History  The OMG set up a Business Rules Working Group in 2002 as the first standards body to recognize the importance of the \\"Business Rules Approach\\". It issued 2 main RFPs in 2003 - a standard for modeling production rules (PRR), and a standard for modeling business rules as business documentation (BSBR, now SBVR). PRR was mostly defined by and for vendors of Business Rule Engines (BREs) (sometimes termed Business Rules Engine(s), like in Wikipedia). Contributors have included all the major BRE vendors, members of RuleML, and leading UML vendors.  Evolution  # The PRR RFP originally suggested that PRR use a combination of UML OCL and Action Semantics for rule conditions and actions. However, expecting modellers to learn 2 relatively obscure UML languages in order to define a production rule proved unpalatable. Therefore PRR OCL was defined that included OCL extensions for simple rule actions (as well as external functions). PRR OCL is currently considered \\"non-normative\\" i.e. is not part of the PRR standard per se. PRR beta applies just to a PRR Core that excludes an explicit expression language. # The PRR RFP envisaged covering both forward and backward chaining rule engines. However, the lack of vendor support for / interest in backward chaining caused this to be revise to forward chaining and \\"sequential\\" semantics. The latter is simply the scripting mode provided by many BPM tools, where rules are listed and executed sequentially as if programmed. This provides PRR with better compatibility with typical BPM scripting engines (and acknowledges the fact that most BREs today support a \\"sequential\\" mode of operation, improving performance in some circumstances).  Status  PRR is currently at version 1.0. Per the OMG process it is currently being revised by a Revision Task Force expecting to release a 1.1 version in 2010. Revision task force members were ILOG Inc (co- chair), NoMagic Inc, TIBCO Software Inc, Business Semantics Ltd, Inferware LLC, Sandpiper Software Inc, and 88 Solutions Inc.

It was released in Japan in July 2007, and in North America on November 6, 2007. The game uses both of the DS's screens, touch functionality, and the microphone during game play. The story revolves around colorful spirits called Ontama, who live on a tropical island and can create music. The player must quickly capture Ontama with the stylus while keeping up with the beat. Plot Taking place on a tropical island, the focus of the story are the Ontama spirits. Someone steals the Ontama by hypnotizing the island's people. Beat and Rest, the main characters, are both \\"Ontamaestros\\" and they attempt to free the Ontama by battling the islanders in musical fights. =Storyline= Ontama are colorful musical spirits that exist in the world of Ontamarama, a peaceful world of beauty and natural rhythm. Ontama are extremely precious to the people there because their playful nature and soothing music bring happiness to everyone; Ontamaestros devote their lives to study the Ontama and learn how to orchestrate them to make music. A young boy and girl, Beat and Rest live on a small tropical island in this world. As childhood friends as well as friendly rivals who aspire to become famous Ontamaestros, they compete to see who will be the one to achieve their dream first. One day, on their way back home from the OntaConservatory, where they study to become Ontamaestros, Beat and Rest find a weakened Otama in the middle of the road. This surprises them because Otama rarely appear in these places. It turns out that Blast, a demon seeking power, is capturing all of the Otamas. The player picks to play as either Beat or Rest, and must play against various enemy ontamaestros who use captured Otamas. =Characters= Beat: A high spirited boy who is studying to become an Ontamaestro. He is good at sports and has the ability to communicate with Ontamas. Rest: A smart girl who thinks before she acts instead of relying on her instincts like Beat does. She is studying to become an Ontamaestro. Coda: The teacher at the OntaConservatory. She has a friendly face but strict personality. She teaches the player how to conduct music with Ontama in tutorial mode. Alto: A fairy who, while taking a nap with the Ontamas, was woken up by a terrible noise. She becomes hypnotized by a robot and is forced to capture Ontamas. Aria: A maid in the village inn who follows a strange woman outside the window at night. It turns out the woman is playing a mysterious melody to capture Ontamas. When the woman discovers that Aria had followed her, she placed a Track Disk into Aria's necklace, causing her to fall unconscious. Gig and Club: Club and his pet alligator, Gig, grew up together. Although Gig was too wild to be a house pet, Club found a way to calm Gig down using the music of Ontamas. The two of them are in search of an Ontama that will play music by itself without having to be conducted. Elegy: An infernal robot created by Blast to collect the Ontamas. Elegy cannot speak but is able to fly. Poco: A boy who lives in the jungle. While investigating the cause of strange phenomena in the jungle, Poco meets a boy who tells Poco that the strangeness is caused by the Ontama. The boy hands a track disk to Poco, tricking him into capturing Ontamas in order to save the jungle. Dia and Tonic: A boy who was adopted by a wealthy family and led an extravagant, but boring, life. While strolling through the forest hoping to find some excitement, he finds Blast, who convinces Tonic to work with him. Suite: A fangirl of Blast from the demonic realm. She decides to follow and help Blast when she accidentally sees him go into the human world. Rubato: A butler who has served and raised many princes in the demonic realm. He follows Blast in order to keep an eye on him. Blast: A prince of demons who yearns for greater power because he is insecure about his short stature and weaknesses. He escaped to the human world in order to gather Ontama to strengthen his powers. Gameplay Ontamarama's gameplay is a combination of games like Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) and Elite Beat Agents. The player must hit a D-pad direction as it passes through a circle, similar to DDR, but with the stylus. Each arrow has a color and will only register if enough colored energy is stored. To store energy, the player must touch colored Ontama that move across the touch screen. Black Ontamas may appear and block the colored ones, and some Ontama need to be touched twice. Blowing into the microphone allows the player to clear the screen of all Ontama, but this can only be used a limited number of times. The player should focus on clearing all the Ontamas on the screen. Ontama can be freed by tapping them with the stylus or drawing a circle around a group of Ontama of the same color. The player can also hold or swing Otama to clear them. Points are rewarded when Ontama are freed. However, Black Ontamas penalize the player for clearing them. Chains and bonus multipliers increase the score. For example, three Ontama cleared in a row gives the player a 3× multiplier. Once an Otama is freed, it fills its corresponding colored note, which corresponds to an arrow on the control pad that must be pressed at the time when it reaches the circle at the end. Hold notes require the player to press the button down at the start of the note and release it at the end of the note. Depending on the player's timing, a score (Good/Great/Master) is added to the overall performance score. There is a performance gauge that indicates how well the player is doing. The player will have to replay the song if performance falls to zero. In addition to gameplay, Ontama Points can be used to buy items from the shop. =Ontama= Different colored Otamas have different abilities. White: Do not correspond to any notes, but give a boost to the performance gauge. Black: Do not correspond to any notes and lower the performance gauge. Red, Blue, Green, Yellow: Normal Ontama that correspond to notes. =Modes= Tutorial mode is for beginners to learn the basic gameplay. Story mode is the only mode available at the start; it goes through 12 stages. There are three levels of difficulty. Free mode is unlocked following the first time Story mode is beaten. It gives the player access to play any of the songs from Story mode, including bonus tracks. There are multiple modes to unlock, such as Challenge mode and Random mode. Song List The song, \\"Let's Go Onmyoji!\\" is a recognizable song for fans of J-Pop. The other songs were created solely for the game. Development According to Atlus USA, Ontamarama was a worthy project for them to take on because \\"it stood out as a lively and fun game that is easy to learn, yet challenging to master.\\" The North American version of the game has almost all the same songs as the Japanese release. However, a few songs had to be dropped due to licensing issues. Reception Ontamarama received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN felt that the gameplay was too complicated, but that the game had plenty of charm. Aaron Kaluszka, a reviewer from Nintendo World Report, said, \\"Ontamarama is certainly no Elite Beat Agents, but its style of gameplay is definitely unique.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one seven, one four, and two sixes, for a total of 23 out of 40.

It is the parish capital of St. Andrew.Jamaicans.com: Regions in Jamaica Half Way Tree is served by the Kingston 10 post office.Postal Corporation of Jamaica Press Release In recent years, as a result of crime and violence in Downtown Kingston and Cross Roads, Half Way Tree has overtaken these areas as the central hub of the capital, Kingston and, perhaps, the busiest thoroughfare in the city. The area has become a popular location to do business in Kingston because of its central location and close proximity to Downtown Kingston, the New Kingston Business District as well as it being the transportation of hub of Kingston. The National Works Agency, for example, estimates that approximately 250,000 commute through the Half Way Tree area on a daily basis from Monday through Saturdays. In recent years, the area has become increasingly attractive as a residential neighbourhood to young professionals, again because of its proximity to where many of them work. The apartments and townhouses are located mainly on Surbiton Road, Winchester Road, Ruthven Road and Cecelio Avenue. As a result, Half Way Tree has become one of the most expensive areas in Kingston to purchase real estate: an acre of land can run as high as US$1.5 million. A number of prominent schools, including St Andrew High School for Girls and Holy Childhood High School, are located in the heart of Half Way Tree. A busy shopping district, Half Way Tree is also home to the most well-known plazas and malls—such as Twin Gates, Mall Plaza, Tropical Plaza, Kings Plaza, Lane Plaza, the Pavilion Mall—in Kingston and Jamaica as a whole. There are also a number of prominent churches in the area such as Holy Cross Church and Webster Memorial. Devon House, home of the first West Indian millionaire of African descent.

History Siam Park's construction started in 2004 and cost 52 million euros (US$58.7 million) Originally stated to open in May 2007, it has endured construction problems, however the park finally opened to the public on September 17, 2008. The park's plans also originally included a roller coaster, but the park has opted to focus on developing the first phase of the park in order to open the park as soon as possible. Siam Park includes Thai theming on all of its rides, park buildings, and restaurants. The park's 25 buildings are the largest collection of Thai- themed buildings outside Thailand. The park's designer, Christoph Kiessling, received permission from the Thai royal family to use the park's name and theme; but, to respect the family's wishes, he did not copy royal palaces, temples, or statues of Buddha in the park.

Early life Beeckman was born on April 15, 1866 in New York City, New York. He was the son of Gilbert Livingston Beeckman (1823–1874) and Margaret Atherton (née Foster) Beeckman (1832–1904). His sister, Katherine Livingston Beeckman, was married to Louis Lasher Lorillard, the son of Pierre Lorillard III, and another sister, Martha Beeckman, was married to New York banker Amos Tuck French. His family ancestry can be traced back to Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam dating to 1654. His ancestors include Robert Livingston the Elder, Declaration signer Philip Livingston and \\"The Chancellor\\" Robert Livingston. His family owned the financial firm Lapsley Beeckman & Co. When Beeckman was young, his family moved to Newport, Rhode Island. He left school at the age of sixteen to become a stockbroker. Career At the age of 16, Beeckman began his career at a stock brokerage firm in New York. At age 21, Beeckman became one of the youngest ever members of the New York Stock Exchange, being a member from 1887 until 1906. By 1916, he retired from the brokerage business. After this time, he was a member of the board of directors of several corporations, including the Industrial Trust Company, the Newport Trust Company, the International Silver Company, and the Newport Casino. =Sportsman= Beeckman was also a prominent polo player and tennis player. He played in the finals of the 1886 United States National Tennis Championships, which took place in Newport. He lost to defending champion Richard Sears with the score was 4–6, 6–1, 6–3, 6–4. =Political career= Beeckman's first political office was a Rhode Island state Representative in the General Assembly from Newport, from 1908 to 1912. At the time, Beeckman said \\"he was entering active politics because he believed it to be his duty. He felt the time had come for the step, which he had weighed carefully before accepting the responsibilities the office would incur.\\" He was a state Senator from 1912 to 1914, until his election as the governor of Rhode Island in 1914. He held the governor's office from January 5, 1915 to January 4, 1921.Sobel, Robert and John Raimo. Biographical Directory of the Governors of the United States, 1789-1978. Greenwood Press, 1988. During his administration, Beeckman pushed for reforms in State institutions including hospitals, prisons, and insane asylums, established an inheritance tax, and established a state Parole Board. He was the governor during the First World War. He visited Rhode Island troops on the battlefield in France and pushed for state appropriations to provide for dependent families of servicemen. Beeckman advocated for removing the property qualification for Rhode Island voters. A close friend of then Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, he was mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate in 1920, but ultimately Calvin Coolidge was selected and became president upon Harding's death in 1923. Beeckman was governor during the Spanish flu pandemic, which struck the state in early September 1918. Acting on the advice of superintendent of health Charles V. Chapin, Beeckman delayed issuing a closure order until October 6. The peak of the pandemic occurred October 3-9, with over 6,700 cases reported. Beeckman lifted the closure order on October 25. A second, smaller wave hit Rhode Island schools in January, and the flu was declared eradicated in Rhode Island in February 1919. After Beeckman stepped down from the governorship after three terms, he unsuccessfully ran in 1922 to represent Rhode Island in the United States Senate, losing to the incumbent Democratic senator, Peter Goelet Gerry. During the campaign, it was alleged that Beeckman and his campaign manager, J. Henry Reuter, attempted to bribe Herve J. Lagage with $1,500. Beeckman admitted to the payment, but \\"insist[ed] that it was their understanding that Lagace had agreed to work for Beeckman and that the money paid to him was to be used for legitimate expenses of the campaign.\\" Personal life The gravesite of Robert Livingston Beeckman Beeckman was married first to Eleanor Thomas of Zanesville, Ohio in 1902. She was the daughter of Gen. Samuel Russell Thomas and Ann Augusta (née Porter) Thomas and the sister of Edward Russell Thomas. Upon her father's death in 1903, she inherited the income from half of his $10,000,000 estate. After his first wife's death in 1920, he remarried Edna (née Marston) Burke at Bar Harbor, Maine in September 1923. Edna, who was divorced from Oscar Meech Burke, was the daughter of Edwin Sprague Marston, the former president and chairman of the board of directors of the Farmers' Loan & Trust Company (predecessor firm of Citigroup), and Emma Bennett (née Doty) Marston. He had no children. He was an active member of the Freemasons.The Political Graveyard: Freemasons, politicians, Rhode Island at politicalgraveyard.com He died on January 21, 1935 at his winter home in Santa Barbara, California, of a heart attack. He was interred at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York. After his death, his widow remarried to Archibald Gourley Thacher in 1937. =Residences= In 1903, Beeckman purchased the former home of Wallace C. Andrews at 854 Fifth Avenue between 66th and 67th Streets for $325,000. He hired architects Warren & Wetmore to build him a six-story Beaux-Arts residence which was completed in 1905. They owned the home until 1912 when they decided to live full-time in Rhode Island and, after leasing it to Pittsburgh banker Benjamin Thaw Sr. for a number of years, the home was sold to George Grant Mason for $700,000.

Livingston Beeckman, who has survived more railroad, polo, and yachting accidents than any other member of Newport society,\\" was in a railroad accident in Sulphur Springs which he escaped without serious injury. The Beeckman's also owned a winter home in Providence, Rhode Island, which was damaged by a fire in January 1912. Their Newport estate, known as Lands End, was also damaged by a fire in September 1912. He later became a winter resident of Santa Barbara, California, where he rented the home of Arthur Meeker, although he was renting the Edward Ryerson house at the time of his death.

He served as the 58th Governor of Rhode Island and Judge for the Rhode Island Superior Court. Early life Quinn was born in 1894 in Phenix, Rhode Island, the son of Charles Quinn and Mary Ann (McCabe) Quinn. He graduated from Brown University in 1915, and completed his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1918. He served in the United States Foreign Service during World War I as a member of the U.S. Diplomatic Intelligence Service in England and France. After he left the Foreign Service in 1919, he practiced law with his uncle in Rhode Island. Political career He began his political career as a Democrat in the Rhode Island Senate serving from 1923 to 1925 and again from 1929 to 1933. In 1932 he was elected Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island and served from 1933 to 1937. He served as governor from 1937 to 1939. =State Senate= Quinn entered the Rhode Island Senate in 1923 as one of a trio of young progressive politicians, a group which included Governor William S. Flynn and Lt. Governor Felix A. Toupin. Their agenda of reform included a 48-hour work week and an end to property qualifications for voting in city council elections. The Republican-controlled state senate blocked these reforms, and the 1923 and 1924 sessions were spent mostly in deadlock. Finally, in June 1924, Quinn and Lt. Governor Toupin came up with a desperate plan: they would stage a marathon multi-day filibuster. Toupin read from \\"Hamlet\\" and the Encyclopædia Britannica, in hopes that enough exhausted Republicans would leave the chamber, giving Democrats the majority they needed to pass the measure. By June 19, Republicans had had enough, and sent a Boston gangster to set off a bromine gas bomb in the Senate chamber. Quinn and Toupin were unhurt, but the entire Republican delegation fled the chamber, and indeed fled the state. The Senate was then unable to form a quorum to get anything done. The Providence Journal blamed the gas attack on the Democrats, who lost widely in November 1924. =Governor= He was nominated for governorship of Rhode Island when incumbent Governor Theodore Francis Green chose to run for a seat in the United States Senate. 1937 Library of Congress photo He held the governor's office from January 5, 1937 to January 3, 1939. During his administration, Quinn advocated a merit system for state workers, a personal income tax, and exemption for the poor from real estate taxes. Nicknamed \\"Fighting Bob\\", he set up a battle known as the \\"Race Track War\\" against the highly successful Thoroughbred racing venue Narragansett Park in 1937. From the first incident on September 2, the \\"War\\" would not be resolved until October 16. The National Guard was called out and men with machine guns blocked the front entrance to the track. Time Magazine reported the story nationwide in October 1937.Time Magazine 9/20/37. Quinn won in the short-term, as Walter O'Hara was removed from his post as president and manager of the Narragansett Racing Association, and Judge James E. Dooley officially took control of the track. Quinn was unsuccessful in his re- election bid in 1938 when he lost to millionaire William Henry Vanderbilt III, a brother to Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr. who was a major figure in Thoroughbred racing. Ultimately, the \\"Race Track War\\" was considered a national embarrassment.An Album of Rhode Island History by Patrick T. Conley =Superior Court= Quinn returned to his law practice after leaving the governor's office. He won appointment to a Superior Court judgeship in 1941, serving as judge for the Rhode Island Superior Court. During World War II, he entered the military as a commander in the navy's legal branch. He served for four years, rising to the rank of captain. He returned to the bench after the end of the war. =United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces= On May 22, 1951 he was nominated by President Truman as Chief Judge of a new United States Court of Military Appeals. He was confirmed by the Senate June 19, and was sworn the next day, June 20 of 1951. He was reappointed to his position as Chief Justice by President Johnson for another 15-year term, but he retired from that in 5 years in 1971. He fully retired from the court in 1975, shortly before his death. In 1964 he was awarded the first honorary life membership by the Federal Bar Association, and in 1966 he was elected to the Rhode Island Hall of Fame. Death Quinn died on May 19, 1975 at age 81 in a nursing home in Warwick. He is interred at Quinn Family Cemetery in West Warwick. Family life In 1923 Quinn married Mary Carter. They had five children including Norma Marie, Robert Carter, Pauline, Cameron Peter and Penelope Dorr. References Further reading * Sobel, Robert and John Raimo.

It is a target to be visited by the Lucy mission in August 2027. Discovered during the second Palomar–Leiden Trojan survey in 1973, it was later named after Eurybates from Greek mythology. The C/P-type asteroid belongs to the 60 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 8.7 hours. Eurybates has one known satellite, named Queta, that was discovered in images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in September 2018.  Discovery  Eurybates was discovered on 19 September 1973, by Dutch astronomers Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden, on photographic plates taken by Tom Gehrels at the Palomar Observatory in California, United States. In 1951, it was first observed as ' at the Goethe Link Observatory, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 22 years prior to its official discovery observation at Palomar. Since the discovery of 588 Achilles by Max Wolf in 1906, more than 7000 Jupiter trojans, with nearly 4600 bodies in the Greek camp, have already been discovered. = Palomar–Leiden Trojan survey = While the discovery date aligns with the second Palomar–Leiden Trojan survey, Eurybates has not received a prefixed survey designation, which was assigned for the discoveries made by the fruitful collaboration between the Palomar and Leiden observatories in the 1960s and 1970s. Gehrels used Palomar's Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden Observatory where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of several thousand asteroids.  Orbit and classification  Eurybates is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of Jupiter's orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7–5.7 AU once every 11 years and 10 months (4,321 days; semi- major axis of 5.19 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the ecliptic. = Eurybates family = Eurybates is the parent body of the small Eurybates family (), with 218 known members of carbonaceous and/or primitive composition. Only a few families have been identified among the Jovian asteroids; four of them in the Greek camp. This potentially collisional family was first characterized by Jakub Rozehnal and Miroslav Brož in 2011, and further described in 2014. Members of this family include the Jupiter trojans , 8060 Anius, 9818 Eurymachos, , and 360072 Alcimedon.  Physical characteristics  Eurybates has been characterized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid by both the Lucy mission team and Brian Warner's Lightcurve Data Base. The overall spectral type for members of the Eurybates family is that of a C- and P-type. = Rotational lightcurves = In May 1992, a rotational lightcurve of Eurybates was obtained from photometric observations by Stefano Mottola and Maria Gonano–Beurer using the now decommissioned ESO 1-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory in northern Chile. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 8.711 hours with a brightness variation of 0.20 magnitude (). In October 2010, photometric observations by American astronomer Robert Stephens at the Goat Mountain Astronomical Research Station in California gave a concurring period of 8.73 hours and an amplitude of 0.19 magnitude (). Eurybates has two determined spin axes at (143.0°, −45.0°) and/or (325.0°, –61.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Eurybates measures between 63.89 and 72.14 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.052 and 0.060. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link agrees with IRAS, and derives an albedo of 0.0491 and a diameter of 72.08 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 9.6.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Eurybates, the Ancient hero from Greek mythology, who was a herald for the Greek armies during the Trojan War. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 28 April 1991 ().  Lucy mission target  Eurybates is planned to be visited by the Lucy spacecraft which will launch in 2021. The fly by is scheduled for 12 August 2027, and will approach the asteroid to a distance of 1000 kilometers at a velocity of 5.8 kilometers per second and a solar phase angle of 81°. The mission's seven targets in chronological order with their flyby dates are:https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/pdf/2025.pdf * 52246 Donaldjohanson — 20 April 2025: 4 km diameter C-type asteroid in the inner main-belt, member of ~130Myr old Erigone family; * 3548 Eurybates — 12 August 2027: 64 km diameter C-type Jupiter Trojan in the Greek camp at , largest member of the only confirmed disruptive collisional family in the Trojans; * 15094 Polymele — 15 September 2027: 21 km diameter P-type Trojan at , likely collisional fragment; * 11351 Leucus — 18 April 2028: 34 km diameter D-type slow rotator Trojan at ; * 21900 Orus — 11 November 2028: 51 km diameter D-type Trojan at ; * 617 Patroclus — 2 March 2033: P-type binary Trojan. The primary, Patroclus, has a mean diameter of 113 km and its companion, Menoetius, has a diameter of 104 km. The pair orbit at a separation of 680 km. The binary resides in the Trojan camp at .  Satellite  Discovery images of Queta taken by Hubble on 12–14 September 2018 Eurybates has one known satellite, named Queta after Mexican Olympic athlete Enriqueta Basilio. Provisionally designated S/2018 (3548) 1, the satellite was discovered by Keith S. Noll and colleagues in images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in September 2018. Subsequent follow-up observations later confirmed the satellite's existence, and the discovery was announced on 9 January 2020. The satellite was given the name Queta on 15 October 2020, in accordance with the International Astronomical Union's Olympic athlete naming convention for small Jupiter trojans (H > 12). In the naming citation, Enriqueta Basilio was recognized as the first woman torchbearer at the 1968 Summer Olympics, analogous to the role of heralds like Eurybates. Queta is very dim, with an apparent magnitude of ~26.77. It is at least 6,000 times fainter than Eurybates, suggesting that it is likely very small in size, less than in diameter. Assuming that Queta has the same albedo as Eurybates, its diameter would be . The satellite has an orbital period of days, with a semi-major axis of and low eccentricity of . It is probably a fragment of Eurybates since it is part of a known collisional family. The presence of the satellite does not pose any adverse effects on the Lucy mission, though it provides an additional object for the spacecraft to study during its flyby in 2027.

The show's aim was to answer curious questions about the human body, where the Super Junior members perform the answers by doing experiments with their own bodies. The show succeeded in attracting a wide audience due to its comedic and educational content.  Background  After previous popular shows X-Man and Reverse Drama ended, SBS's Good Sunday decided to air a new educational program, introducing the audience to the human body. Shin Dong-yup was chosen to be the lead MC, with the Super Junior members being regulars and co-MCs of the program. Ratings for the show became the highest of all three shows that aired in SBS's new Good Sunday lineup as the show is educational and entertaining to watch. It was also the first and currently the only variety show that included every member of Super Junior as regulars. Each episode has a main topic to explore regarding the human body. In the first episode, which involved the tongue and blindness, the Super Junior members taste very hot peppers and extremely bitter-tasting drinks to test the mysteries of the tongue. The Super Junior members also test the blindness of their eyes by doing eye-fooling tests. Many episodes do not simply involve the physical features of the body.

It was discovered on 15 October 1985, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at the Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, in the United States. The dark D-type asteroid belongs to the 50 largest Jupiter trojans and has a relatively long rotation period of 40.59 hours. It was named after the Greek hero Talthybius, who was a herald during the Trojan War.  Orbit and classification  Talthybius is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60° ahead its orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.0–5.4 AU once every 11 years and 10 months (4,334 days; semi-major axis of 5.2 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 16° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery at Palomar Observatory in December 1950, almost 35 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.  Physical characteristics  In the SDSS-based taxonomy, Talthybius is dark D-type asteroid. Pan-STARRS's survey also characterized it as a D-type, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) assumed it to be of a carbonaceous C-type composition. = Rotation period = In June 1994, a rotational lightcurve of Talthybius was obtained by Stefano Mottola and Anders Erikson using the Bochum 0.61-metre Telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 40.59 hours with a brightness variation of 0.38 magnitude (). Photometric observations by Robert Stephen at the Goat Mountain Astronomical Research Station in November 2009 and at the Center for Solar System Studies in February 2015, gave two concurring periods of 40.40 and 40.44 hours with a corresponding amplitude of 0.31 and 0.38 (). While not being a slow rotator, Talthybiuses period is significantly longer than that of most larger Jupiter trojans, which have a spin rate of typically 10 hours. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Talthybius measures between 68.92 and 74.11 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.062 and 0.093.

The Trojan asteroid was discovered on 14 October 1985, by American astronomer Carolyn Shoemaker at the Palomar Observatory in California, United States, and named after Polypoites from Greek mythology. The dark D-type asteroid belongs to the 50 largest Jupiter trojans. It has a rotation period of 10 hours and possibly a spherical shape.  Orbit and classification  Polypoites is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of the Gas Giant's orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9–5.6 AU once every 12.00 years (4,381 days; semi-major axis of 5.24 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 20° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as ' at Crimea–Nauchnij in July 1971. The body's observation arc begins at Palomar on 21 September 1985, just three weeks prior to its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  In both the Tholen- and SMASS-like taxonomy of the Small Solar System Objects Spectroscopic Survey (S3OS2), Polypoites is a D-type asteroid. It is also a generically assumed C-type asteroid. = Rotation period = Between 2010 and 2017, several rotational lightcurves have been obtained from photometric observations by Robert Stevens at the Center for Solar System Studies in California. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve from April 2016 gave a period of 10.039 hours with a brightness variation of 0.12 magnitude (). A low brightness amplitude between 0.12 and 0.18 is also indicative of a rather spherical shape. These results supersede a period of 43 hours () measured at the Calvin–Rehoboth and Calvin College observatories in 2007. = Diameter and albedo = Results from space-based surveys diverge significantly: according to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Polypoites measures between 65.30 and 99.09 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.0452 and 0.087. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link agrees with the results obtained by IRAS (11 observations) and derives a diameter of 99.01 kilometers with an albedo of 0.0413 based on an absolute magnitude of 9.1.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after the Greek hero Polypoites, who fought during the Trojan War. In a competition among the Greek warriors, he was able to throw an iron meteorite the farthest and won the game against Leonteus, after whom the minor planet 3793 Leonteus is named. On landing, the meteorite formed an impact crater. The asteroid's name was suggested by Dorothy and Jerome Preston, with the remark, that, had the Shoemakers been present, they would have examined the event closely. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 2 April 1988 ().

The squadron is based at CFB Petawawa, Ontario with a fleet of Bell CH-146 Griffon helicopters. It was founded during the Second World War as No. 427 Squadron RCAF.  History  427 Squadron started as a bomber squadron formed at Croft, England on 7 November 1942 and spent its wartime entirely in England as a part of No. 6 Group RCAF, RAF Bomber Command. 427 flew Vickers Wellington Mk IIIs and Mk Xs from its first operational mission on 14 December 1942, a minelaying sortie to the Frisian Islands, until May 1943 when it was relocated to Leeming, North Yorkshire. Re-equipped with Handley Page Halifax Mk V aircraft, the squadron flew intensely until early 1944 when it replaced its inventory with Halifax Mk III aircraft. This fleet saw the greatest number of missions and in slightly more than a year's time they were then replaced by Avro Lancaster bombers prior to the end of World War II. The Lancasters were used for prisoner of war repatriation until the end of May 1946. 427 was stood down on 1 June 1946. The squadron was reformed on 1 August 1952 at RCAF Station St. Hubert (a suburb of modern-day Montreal, Quebec, Canada) as 427 Fighter Squadron, flying Canadair Sabres, and was transferred to No. 3 (Fighter) Wing at Zweibrücken in March 1953. Selected as the first European RCAF squadron to receive the CF-104 Starfighter in the nuclear strike role, the squadron was stood down from its day-fighter role on 15 December 1962 and reformed as 427 (Strike-Attack) Squadron two days later. On 1 February 1968, unification integrated 427 into the new Canadian Forces. The squadron was again disbanded on 1 July 1970. 427 came back into existence as 427 Tactical Helicopter Squadron at CFB Petawawa, where it remains today. The squadron has also taken an active role in humanitarian efforts such as the January 1998 ice storm in eastern Canada, where the squadron deployed eight aircraft to Ottawa and Kingston, and the November 1998 mission to help the victims of Hurricane Mitch. With only 24 hours' notice, four 427 Squadron Griffons deployed to La Ceiba, Honduras. Once in the country, Griffon crews airlifted medical teams into communities cut off by the hurricane. For the next six weeks, the squadron ferried supplies and aid workers to many isolated towns and villages. On 1 February 2006, command of 427 was transferred to Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, as it took on a full-time role of special operations aviation support. Shortly thereafter, it was renamed as, 427 Special Operations Aviation Squadron (SOAS). Unlike the 160th SOAR (US Army) and other units in CANSOFCOM—JTF 2, CSOR, and CJIRU—there are no specialized standards (in the \\"Special Operations\\" context) for any 427 SOAS members and entrance into 427 SOAS requires only \\"negotiations through Career Managers and losing units.\\" The squadron has a dedicated concrete helipad, measuring , at Petawawa Heliport.

It can be used to estimate summatory functions of the form :\\\\sum_{n \\\\leq N} f(n)\\\\Lambda(n) where f is some arithmetic function of the natural integers n, whose values in applications are often roots of unity, and Λ is the von Mangoldt function. Procedure for applying the method The motivation for Vaughan's construction of his identity is briefly discussed at the beginning of Chapter 24 in Davenport. For now, we will skip over most of the technical details motivating the identity and its usage in applications, and instead focus on the setup of its construction by parts. Following from the reference, we construct four distinct sums based on the expansion of the logarithmic derivative of the Riemann zeta function in terms of functions which are partial Dirichlet series respectively truncated at the upper bounds of U and V, respectively. More precisely, we define F(s) = \\\\sum_{m \\\\leq U} \\\\Lambda(m) m^{-s} and G(s) = \\\\sum_{d \\\\leq V} \\\\mu(d) d^{-s}, which leads us to the exact identity that :-\\\\frac{\\\\zeta^{\\\\prime}(s)}{\\\\zeta(s)} = F(s) - \\\\zeta(s) F(s) G(s) - \\\\zeta^{\\\\prime}(s) G(s) + \\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\zeta^{\\\\prime}(s)}{\\\\zeta(s)} - F(s)\\\\right) (1-\\\\zeta(s) G(s)). This last expansion implies that we can write :\\\\Lambda(n) = a_1(n) + a_2(n) + a_3(n) + a_4(n), where the component functions are defined to be :\\\\begin{align} a_1(n) & := \\\\Biggl\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\Lambda(n), & \\\\text{ if } n \\\\leq U;  0, & \\\\text{ if } n > U\\\\end{matrix}  a_2(n) & := - \\\\sum_{\\\\stackrel{mdr = n}{\\\\stackrel{m \\\\leq U}{d \\\\leq V}}} \\\\Lambda(m) \\\\mu(d)  a_3(n) & := \\\\sum_{\\\\stackrel{hd=n}{d \\\\leq V}} \\\\mu(d) \\\\log(h)  a_4(n) & := -\\\\sum_{\\\\stackrel{mk=n}{\\\\stackrel{m > U}{k > 1}}} \\\\Lambda(m) \\\\left(\\\\sum_{\\\\stackrel{dk}{d \\\\leq V}} \\\\mu(d)\\\\right). \\\\end{align} We then define the corresponding summatory functions for 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq 4 to be :S_i(N) := \\\\sum_{n \\\\leq N} f(n) a_i(n), so that we can write :\\\\sum_{n \\\\leq N} f(n) \\\\Lambda(n) = S_1(N) + S_2(N) + S_3(N) + S_4(N). Finally, at the conclusion of a multi-page argument of technical and at times delicate estimations of these sums,N.b., which if you read Davenport frequently enough will lead you to conclude evident properties about the difficulty level of the complete details to proving Vaughan's identity carefully. we obtain the following form of Vaughan's identity when we assume that f(n) \\\\leq 1,\\\\ \\\\forall n, U,V \\\\geq 2, and UV \\\\leq N: :\\\\sum_{n \\\\leq N} f(n) \\\\Lambda(n) \\\\ll U + (\\\\log N) \\\\times \\\\max_{w} \\\\left\\\\sum_{w \\\\leq r \\\\leq \\\\frac{N}{t}} f(rt)\\\\right + \\\\sqrt{N} (\\\\log N)^3 \\\\times \\\\max_{U \\\\leq M \\\\leq N/V} \\\\max_{V \\\\leq j \\\\leq N/M}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{V < k \\\\leq N/M} \\\\left \\\\sum_{\\\\stackrel{M < m \\\\leq 2M}{\\\\stackrel{m \\\\leq N/k}{m \\\\leq N/j}}} f(mj) \\\\bar{f(mk)}\\\\right\\\\right)^{1/2} \\\\mathbf{(V1)}. It is remarked that in some instances sharper estimates can be obtained from Vaughan's identity by treating the component sum S_2 more carefully by expanding it in the form of :S_2 = \\\\sum_{t \\\\leq UV} \\\\longmapsto \\\\sum_{t \\\\leq U} + \\\\sum_{U < t \\\\leq UV} =: S_2^{\\\\prime} + S_2^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}. The optimality of the upper bound obtained by applying Vaughan's identity appears to be application-dependent with respect to the best functions U = f_U(N) and V = f_V(N) we can choose to input into equation (V1). See the applications cited in the next section for specific examples that arise in the different contexts respectively considered by multiple authors. Applications * Vaughan's identity has been used to simplify the proof of the Bombieri–Vinogradov theorem and to study Kummer sums (see the references and external links below). * In Chapter 25 of Davenport, one application of Vaughan's identity is to estimate an important prime-related exponential sum of Vinogradov defined by :S(\\\\alpha) := \\\\sum_{n \\\\leq N} \\\\Lambda(n) e\\\\left(n\\\\alpha\\\\right). In particular, we obtain an asymptotic upper bound for these sums (typically evaluated at irrational \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\setminus \\\\mathbb{Q}) whose rational approximations satisfy :\\\\left \\\\alpha - \\\\frac{a}{q} \\\\right \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{q^2}, (a, q) = 1, of the form :S(\\\\alpha) \\\\ll \\\\left(\\\\frac{N}{\\\\sqrt{q}} + N^{4/5} + \\\\sqrt{Nq}\\\\right) (\\\\log N)^4. The argument for this estimate follows from Vaughan's identity by proving by a somewhat intricate argument that :S(\\\\alpha) \\\\ll \\\\left(UV + q + \\\\frac{N}{\\\\sqrt{U}} + \\\\frac{N}{\\\\sqrt{V}} + \\\\frac{N}{\\\\sqrt{q}} + \\\\sqrt{Nq}\\\\right) (\\\\log(qN))^4, and then deducing the first formula above in the non-trivial cases when q \\\\leq N and with U = V = N^{2/5}. * Another application of Vaughan's identity is found in Chapter 26 of Davenport where the method is employed to derive estimates for sums (exponential sums) of three primes. * Examples of Vaughan's identity in practice are given as the following references / citations in this informative post:.

Thus Laika's traits of trust and eagerness to please are portrayed through her non-verbalised behaviour, and the reactions of the more sympathetic humans with whom she comes in contact. Mistreated as a young dog, Laika shows a need to gain human affection and approval that leads her through a harsh training regime to death in space. Even the empathetic Yelena accepts that animals will die in the space programme, though bitterly regretting that her \\"special dog\\" is the one to be sent with no hope of survival. Many of the incidents portrayed by Abadzis, such as Laika being taken home by a senior officer to play with his children shortly before the launch, are recorded as having actually occurred.\\"The Age - 06Nov2007- 50 years ago, a dog paved way for space travel\\" The graphic novel concludes with a real-life statement of regret by Oleg Gazenko, made in 1998: \\"Work with animals is a source of suffering to all of us.

Electric multiple unit trains are operated under the Metlink brand through this station in both directions to Johnsonville (to the north) and Wellington (to the south).  History  sidings used to be; with Malvina Major Retirement Village (on Burma Road), and Broadmeadows on the skyline. Station car parking off Fraser Avenue. Raroa came into existence subsequent to electrification to serve the needs of the expanding population north of Wellington and was opened on 17 June 1940.Evening Post 12 June 1940 page 6 Construction was authorised in February 1940, and when it was opened, so few houses could be seen from the station that a guard with a sense of humour used to call out Snake Gully, five minutes for refreshments (referring to the then- popular Australian radio serial \\"Dad and Dave from Snake Gully\\"), until someone complained. Raroa Station is notable as the terminus for the last freight traffic on the Johnsonville Branch. Because of transport licensing regulations under a 1931 Act of parliament that required rail to be used in preference to road to cart goods over certain distances if there was a rail option, livestock trains were run on the Johnsonville Branch to transport livestock to the railhead nearest the abattoirs in the Ngauranga Gorge. The terminus of this service used to be the stockyards at Johnsonville station, but public pressure in the 1950s resulted in the stockyards being relocated to Raroa and livestock transhipped there from 2 February 1958. From the stockyards, the livestock were transported by truck to the abattoir. Though the provision relating to the transport of livestock was repealed in 1962, the trains continued to run until about 1973. The siding was not closed until 4 October 1976, and the track was lifted about 1982.  Services  Trains run in both directions through this station, departing at half-hourly intervals, supplemented by a 13/13/26 schedule at peak times on week days. There are no bus connections with this station. The train station is very close to Raroa Intermediate and Onslow College  Facilities  This station has a single side platform and passenger shelter. Access to the station is from Fraser Avenue, with pedestrian access from Haumia Street via a walkway, and from Burma Road (Onslow College and Raroa Intermediate School), Raroa Park and Tuapapa Street via a footbridge.

While Young-nak is no longer the biggest church in South Korea, it is, however, the most prominent Protestant church in the country. Like Kyung- Chik Han himself, his church's earliest ministry was primarily to northern defectors and this remains a hallmark of Young-nak church to this day. When he was awarded a Templeton prize, he sold it and gave the money to charity.

Longtime residents of the area claim Briscoe Springs was named after Father Briscoe who built a small log chapel next to one of the numerous springs in the shallow valley in the late 19th century. The story goes per local historians that he mixed wagon repair with his ministry and that one day Father Briscoe fell in love with a young woman who stopped at the spring. He left the area with her, never to be seen again. Briscoe Springs has many other names. The unincorporated community was also known at varying times as Perry's Corners, named after the blacksmith Jeff Perry, in the late 19th century and as Dye's Corners, after the Dye family that built a service station and a Durant automobile dealership there in the mid-1920s. Briscoe Springs landmarks include the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation signs on its northern and southern ends. A foundation stone said to be per former residents from the chapel built by Father Briscoe is still visible in the yard of a farm owned by John and Ruth McDougall. A one-room schoolhouse, Hemlock School, that was moved into the area when Briscoe Springs began to grow in the 1920s. The school was originally located near Diamond Road and now is located on rte 173 and used as a construction company's office. In 2006 the Burke family purchased the Hemlocks (named because of the Hemlock trees located in the area) located on Diamond Road and renamed the area Hemlock Creek for a dry creek bed located on the property. The Burke family also refer to the private residence on the property as Hemlock Creek Resort. The people of Briscoe Springs included Native American Indians as the first people to inhabit the area known for its springs. Part of Father Briscoe legend is that he came here first as a missionary to the Indians. The first settlers were farmers. Today the area is populated by people from a variety of professions. Medical professionals, retirees, educators, skilled trades people, farmers, and business professionals make up the current population. Many of the homes are obscured by rolling hills and wooded lots. Briscoe Springs as a community didn't develop till after the state paved a six-mile section of Route 173 leading to Grove City in 1922. The first three houses were erected by Ernest Northcote, Henry Hodgson and Everet Swarts in 1923. Today, there are some 50 homes and a smattering of small businesses. Benjamin Dye and his sons opened a service station and garage to sell Durant automobiles in 1924; one of their buildings was occupied by the Palmer-Smith linen company. The Bowie Coal Mine operated on the Nicklin Farm off what is now Nicklin Road in the 1930s. The community was the home of Wolf Creek Outfitters, a fishing and hunting equipment supplier which closed in 2007, the Grove City Bus Line storage garage was closed in the 1990s and Scott's Auto Body. Today the building is home to Lamb & Webster Tractor & Farm Equipment. Swarts Broom Factory moved into a garage owned by Evert Swarts here from Grove City in the 1960s, but is no longer a business.

It is, according to Peter Viney, a historian of the group, \\"the Big Pink track that has appeared on most subsequent live albums and compilations\\", second only to \\"The Weight\\". The music for the piece was written by guitarist Robbie Robertson. Total authorship is typically credited solely to Robertson, although the lyrics, according to Levon Helm, were originally improvised by Levon Helm and Richard Manuel, telling the story of a man who becomes sick when he is spurned by the woman he loves.Levon Helm and Stephen Davis. This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band Robertson has since said the lyrics were nonsensical, used only while the instrumental tracks were recorded. \\"I'm not sure that I know the words to 'Chest Fever'; I'm not even so sure there are words to 'Chest Fever'.\\" He has also stated the entirety of the song does not make sense. At the Woodstock Festival in 1969, the Band performed on the final day, between Ten Years After and Blood, Sweat, and Tears. They opened the set with \\"Chest Fever\\". The song featured a dramatic solo organ intro played by Garth Hudson. Writing in the 3rd edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Paul Evans stated that \\"The organ mastery of 'Chest Fever' unleashed the Band's secret weapon, Garth Hudson.\\" The introduction is based on Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor. In live performances, this solo evolved into an improvisation drawing from numerous musical styles and lasting several minutes. \\"When Levon Helm has complained about the share out of royalties at this period, this is the song he quotes,\\" states Viney. \\"His theme is that Garth's contribution was always grossly under-estimated and under-credited. As he says, 'what do you remember about 'Chest Fever' - the lyrics or the organ part?'\\" Later performances Viney notes that despite the death of Richard Manuel later line-ups of the Band continued to perform \\"Chest Fever\\" with Helm singing lead vocals. It \\"rapidly became an on-stage showpiece for Garth's organ\\", and as such it was an essential song. The intro was an improvisation piece called \\"The Genetic Method\\". He says the definitive recordings of the song can be found on Live in Washinton (sic) an Italian bootleg of the group's 1976 King Biscuit Flower Hour performance, or the version on The Complete Last Waltz. The song has been covered numerous times by bands including Three Dog Night, Sugarloaf, and most recently, the rootsy jam band Widespread Panic. It has also been covered by John Mayer during his Battle Studies tour. The song was chosen by Paul Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra to accompany Bill Murray as Murray emerged from a giant cake during his final appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman on the show's penultimate episode in 2015.

It opened on June 1, 2007, just over 2 months after park opening due to gaps in the track that required re-welding. It is currently the second tallest roller coaster at Lagoon, surpassed only by Cannibal. Description Wicked is located at the front (west side) of the park and is easily seen from I-15. It has a green track with mostly silver supports, the only exception being the bright yellow supports of the launch tower. Elements: horizontal to vertical launch, launch tower, airtime hill, Immelmann turn, heartline roll (Zero-G Roll), double halfpipe, and a tunnel. Wicked on its inversion, June 2007 Wicked was designed by Dal Freeman/Lagoon Corporation, manufactured by Zierer, and fabricated by Stakotra Manufacturing. The ride is thrilling because the car is launched to high speed vertically without any significant warning, has a 90-degree descent on the tower hill, pulls 4.885 gs, features a unique lap-bar restraint, and features an Immelmann turn and heartline roll. It was rumored to be named by the daughter of Dal Freeman (a designer/engineer of Magnum XL-200) as \\"Wicked,\\" after the famous musical and book, or after the fact that the design looked \\"wicked\\" to her. Wicked was the first LSM (linear synchronous motor) launched roller coaster to utilize a flywheel inverter. The LSMs are not only used for launching the trains, but for also braking the trains. The energy recovered by braking the trains is used to spin the flywheel inverter where potential energy is stored and used to launch the trains. Riders start by turning into a dark tunnel with a siren and a loud boom, before shooting straight up the 110 ft vertical launch hill at 40 MPH, cresting, and then descending vertically down the other side of the tower at speeds reaching 55 MPH. Riders then go up and over a small airtime hill with a trim brake, before going up and quickly flipping around an Immelmann turn. The track levels out before sending riders up into a heartline roll. They then descend and then quickly pass around a small, shallow turn into the trim/safety brake. Riders descend into a double half- pipe, then being twisted to the right, left, then into a right half downward helix, then twisting to the left, then descending into a trench covered by a tunnel, before ascending and leveling out into the reduction brake run as the ride ends. Incidents In 2014, a train that had been dispatched for launch unexpectedly lost speed after the initial acceleration track, causing the train to roll back through the section. The train was re-dispatched and was able to complete the layout. Nobody was injured. There have also been multiple cases of the cart rolling back after not gaining enough acceleration up the 90 degree launch, however no one is injured, all they do is relaunch the cart back up the hill. With the key factor launching it being magnets it is not always a 100 percent guarantee for it to work everytime, so this is expected, like Jet Star 2 ..

The company offered six of its ferries for sale in June 1961, citing the fact that \\"trade had dwindled to the vanishing point\\" and service ceased in August 1961. WIF&SS; Co., in its role as a car ferry operator, acted as both a railroad and a steamship line. The service was described as “The Superior All-Rail Route to Cuba.” Freight from anywhere in North America could be routed to Cuban consignees “in the same cars and packaging in which it left point of origin in the United States.” This had advantages enumerated in WIF&SS; Co. sales literature – reduced transit time, less handling of freight, and no repackaging. Vessels During its history, the WIF&SS; Co. operated a total of five car ferries to Cuba very similar in design and operation to the ferries built for Great Lakes service. In addition the company operated two other vessels between the United States and Cuba. *SS Grand Haven (Car Ferry) *SS Henry M. Flagler (Car Ferry) *SS Joseph R. Parrott (Car Ferry) *SS New Grand Haven (Car Ferry) *SS City of New Orleans (Car Ferry) *SS Sea Level (Ship) *SS City of Havana (Automobile Ferry) The Grand Haven was formerly a Grand Trunk Milwaukee Car Ferry Company vessel used previously in trans-Lake Michigan service. She was built by Craig Shipbuilding Company of Toledo, Ohio, in 1903 and appears, from photographic evidence, to be the only ferry in Cuban service fitted with a stern gate, a U.S. Coast Guard requirement for Great Lakes car ferries. She was retired by the WIF&SS; Co. in 1960. (Grand Trunk Milwaukee was a Grand Trunk Railway subsidiary which itself was a subsidiary of Canadian National Railway, then a Crown corporation.) The Henry M. Flagler and the Joseph R. Parrott, former Florida East Coast Car Ferry Company vessels, were built by William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia in 1914 and 1916 respectively for service between Key West, Florida and Havana, Cuba. Requisitioned by the US Navy for duties in World War II, they were subsequently acquired by WIF&SS; Co. for post-war service. (Florida East Coast Car Ferry Company was a Florida East Coast Railway subsidiary and chose not to reenter the car ferry trade after the war.) The New Grand Haven was built by Canadian Vickers, Ltd. in Montreal in 1951. The City of New Orleans was built by Kure Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Kure City, Japan, in 1959. It is believed she only made approximately a hundred trips before service to Cuba was suspended. In addition to the car ferries, the company purchased from Seatrain Lines, Seatrain New Orleans, a four-deck ship built by Swan, Hunter, and Wigham Richardson of Newcastle upon Tyne, England, in 1928. She ran from Belle Chasse (New Orleans) to Havana. Cars were loaded and unloaded by crane and cradles. She was renamed Sea Level by the WIF&SS; Co. and continued in service from Belle Chasse. The company also operated an automobile and passenger ferry, the City of Havana, between Key West and Havana. All the car ferries were active till the cessation of service except for the Grand Haven which had been retired in 1960. =Rail equipment= The WIF&SS; Co. operated at various times a fleet of WIF marked refrigerator cars and boxcars. In the railroad section of the January 1957 Official Railway Equipment Register, 260 cars were listed. Connections At Palm Beach, the company connected with the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) via the West Palm Beach Terminal Company (WPBT). WPBT physically switched railcars on and off the ferries for the WIF&SS; Co. Freight in cars from any North American railway could be routed to the FEC by way of interchange in Jacksonville, Florida. [1] In Havana connection was with the Ferrocarriles Unidos de la Habana (FCUH) or in English United Railways of Havana, which had interchanges with the other Cuban railways. At Belle Chase, LA the WIF&SS; Co. connected the rest of the North American system via the New Orleans and Lower Coast, a Missouri Pacific subsidiary. Operations No transfer of commodities was necessary upon arrival or railcars in Havana; Cuban railways handled the railcars directly to consignees. North American owned railcars operated routinely throughout Cuba, but evidence suggests that cars of the Cuban railways rarely, if ever, operated on North American roads. The WIF&SS; Co. maintained a fleet of refrigerator cars and boxcars with WIF reporting marks. WIF boxcars did regularly operate throughout the United States. Cargo carried northward included tobacco, refined sugar, pineapples, rum, tomatoes, slaughterhouse byproducts, and scrap metal. Cuban bound freight included less-than-carload merchandise, manufactured goods, chemicals, lard, railway equipment, temperate zone fruit such as apples, pears, and grapes, meat, dairy, steel products, and machinery, including oversized loads. Forerunners and competitors Other known companies engaged in United States–Cuba car ferry service are as follows: The Florida East Coast Car Ferry Company, beginning in 1915, operated a service from Key West, Florida to Havana. After the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 destroyed the FEC Key West Extension, service was transferred to Port Everglades. Three ferries were operated until World War II when they were requisitioned by the Navy. The two that survived the war were acquired by the WIF&SS; Co. and restored their original names. After the war, FEC did not resume car ferry service. Seatrain Lines participated in the coasting trade beginning in 1929 hauling railcars between Hoboken, New Jersey, Savannah, Georgia, New Orleans, Louisiana, Havana, Cuba, and Texas City, Texas. In 1953 Seatrain sold its rights and one vessel in the New Orleans to Havana trade to the WIF&SS; Co. Suwannee Trainferry Lines operated at least one ship,the Antonio Maceo, out of Port Everglades to Cuba. The Antonio Maceo had a substantially different configuration than the Great Lakes style ships used by the WIF&SS; Co. Very little documentation exists on this company and possibly service did not last for an extended period. Service started some date after World War II.

It is virtually the same as the statistic that some football leagues refer to as combined net yards. In the game of football, progress is measured by advancing the football towards the opposing team's goal line. Progress can be made during play by the offensive team by advancing the ball from its point of progress at the start of play known as the line of scrimmage or by the defensive team after taking possession of the football via a change of possession (such as punt, kickoff, interception, punt block, blocked kick or fumble). When the offensive team advances the ball by rushing the football, the player who carries the ball is given credit for the difference in progress measured in rushing yards. When the offensive team advances the ball by pass reception, the player who catches the reception is given credit for the difference in progress measured in reception yards. Although the ball may also be advanced by penalty, these yards are not considered all-purpose yards. Progress lost via quarterback sacks is classified variously. Thus, all-purpose yards is a combined total of rushing yards, receiving yards, and all forms of return yards only. Some sources do not specify which types of return yards count toward this total because the most common forms of return yards are kick and punt return yards. Football associations differ on their own specific definitions of the term. The National Collegiate Athletic Association, for example, defines the term as \\"the combined net yards gained by rushing, receiving, interception (and fumble) returns, punt returns, kickoff returns and runbacks of field goal attempts. All-purpose yardage does not include forward passing yardage\\" (at pg. 206). The National Football League (NFL), however, defines combined net yards as \\"Rushing, receiving, interception returns, punt returns, kickoff returns, and fumble returns\\". Neither of these totals makes clear how they record yards from blocked punts recovered, blocked field goals, and missed field goal returns. Records by league ;NCAA Brian Westbrook holds the NCAA all-division record for career all-purpose yards, while Christian McCaffrey holds the single-season record.In order to confirm NCAA records, one must examine all four official NCAA record books—FBS, FCS, Division II, and Division III. ;NFL Jerry Rice holds the NFL career combined net yards record with 23,546 yards, while Darren Sproles set the single-season record in the 2011 season with 2,969 yards. ;CFL Pinball Clemons holds the Canadian Football League (CFL) record for career all-purpose yardage with 25,396 yards which also set a professional football record, while Chad Owens set a new single-season record during the 2012 season with 3,863 yards, which also set a new professional football record.http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/story/2012/11/01/sp-cfl-hamilton- tiger-cats-toronto-argonauts-recap.html On 27 October 2017, in a game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Diontae Spencer set a new CFL single-game record with 496 all-purpose yards: 133 yards receiving, 165 kickoff return yards, 169 punt return yards and 29 missed field goal return yards.

On 1 April 1990 he was assassinated in his apartment in the town of Nynäshamn south of Stockholm. The murder remains officially unsolved. However, the Iranian government is widely believed to have ordered the assassination as it had many similarities with other assassinations and assassination attempts on eastern Kurdish dissidents around the world at this time. In 2003, Sveriges Television showed a documentary film about the case by filmmaker Oscar Hedin. In the film, titled I nationens intresse (\\"In the Interest of the Nation\\"), an Iranian intelligence officer named Reza Taslimi was identified as the probable assassin. The Swedish Security Service (SÄPO) was severely criticised for having obstructed the criminal investigation carried out by the local Swedish police by withholding important information. For example, it was alleged that Taslimi had been identified by a taxi driver, who had driven him from Nynäshamn to Stockholm the day after the murder. However, this information was passed to the local police investigators three years after the assassination and by this time Taslimi had already left Sweden after having been arrested by SÄPO one year earlier on unspecified grounds and secretly deported back to Iran. Arne Nilsson, a retired police officer who was working with the case, said in the film: \\"It's terrible. One of the most vicious crimes has been committed and we didn't get the opportunity to hear a person of much interest for the investigation [...] When we see what they [SÄPO] have withhold from us, it feels very unsatisfactory\\".

Background In March 1940 Cedric Hardwicke initiated plans for a movie made without remuneration by British writers, directors and actors/actresses, intended to honor their homeland's spirit and to benefit war relief charities, with RKO Studios financing the production costs of the film with a $300,000 budget: it was estimated that had the film's pro bono participants been salaried the film would have cost $6 million (the actors and actresses appearing in the film were reportedly paid $60 a week as mandated by Equity - their pay may have been routinely donated). The film - whose first working title was Let The Rafters Ring with This Changing Time and Forever and a Day both later put forward as possibilities - had its original projected completion date of 1 June 1941 negated by the screenplay not being completed until April 1941. W. P. Lipscomb - who was paid $10,000 - wrote this screenplay, reportedly drawing on the brainstorming sessions of a committee of writers musing on a scenario proposed by Robert Stevenson. This scenario, attributed by Stevenson to an unpublished novel he'd written, overtly reprised the scenario of Cavalcade (1933), the first British film to emphatically find favor with the American film industry and moviegoers, which had outlined the personal history of the families resident in a London townhouse within the context of the historical events of 1899 to 1929. To accommodate a large cast of British-born stars Forever and a Day had an extended timespan of 136 years (1804-1940), and was filmed - with minimal advance publicity - in May–December 1941. The film's first episode - directed by Herbert Wilcox and starring his wife Anna Neagle as well as Ray Milland and Claude Rains - was filmed in two weeks in May 1941, with Neagle and Rains reprising their roles in the second episode completed - under Robert Stevenson's direction - in June. The film was then dormant for several months due to scheduling issues with its projected stars: Ronald Colman and Greer Garson had offered to appear in the film but they were disallowed by MGM from playing the focal couple of the third episode, that studio feeling it would lessen the impact of the upcoming Colman/Garson star vehicle Random Harvest. The episode's director Victor Saville extended an invitation to British stage musical star Jessie Matthews, then in New York City preparing for a Broadway role, to replace Garson (Saville had helmed the most successful films made by Matthews in her homeland in the 1930s): Matthews agreed to film Garson's intended scenes over three days in Hollywood in September 1941, playing opposite Ian Hunter whose services MGM had donated to cover for Colman (Hunter had been Matthews' leading man in one of her lesser films: The Man from Toronto (1933)). The fourth episode was set to film in the autumn of 1941 after Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock - the leading man and director - had completed the film Suspicion: the availability of the episode's leading lady: Ida Lupino, was a non-issue, the actress being on suspension at Warner Bros. When the filming of Suspicion ran overtime preventing both Grant and Hitchcock from filming the fourth episode in September 1941 Brian Aherne replaced Grant as Lupino's leading man, with René Clair replacing Hitchcock as director. Filming on the fifth episode - with Edmund Goulding directing leading players Robert Cummings and Merle Oberon - began 27 November 1941, with the film as originally envisioned completed after the filming day of 1 December 1941: however the 8 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor infused in Hardwicke the need to modify the film to reflect the direct involvement in World War II which Pearl Harbor made inevitable. When the film remained incomplete several months into 1942, RKO - who by then had spent $100,000 over the agreed $300,000 production costs budget - insisted the film be \\"wrapped\\" and made ready for release, assigning Frank Lloyd to direct Kent Smith and Ruth Warrick - both RKO contract players - in a \\"framing\\" segment set in 1941 which would open and close the film also popping up between the second and third episode. It was hoped that Forever and a Day could be released in November 1942: however the film would not be released until March 1943.Dayton Journal 14 February 1942 \\"Biggest All-Star Cast Works 2 Years in Secret: nation's entry into war causes change; title still uncertain\\" by Frederick C.

The band has been praised by critics for the melding of different music styles. In 2015 Eftekasat became the resident performing band for Saturday Night Live Arabia. Eftekasat is one of the few Egyptian independent music groups to establish its reputation in a short time. Origin and history Growing up in a musical family and influenced by classic music, Amr Salah started composing music during his youth. He kept experimenting and writing music until he was introduced to the jazz scene. Although exposing his music wasn't an easy process, he kept documenting the music by notation, sequencer, or recording. One of his first tunes, written around 1992, is \\"Anxiety\\", which turned out to be \\"Anxious Dance\\", the first track on the album Mouled Sidi El-Latini. Salah met Samer George at the French Cultural Centre where Samer was performing Beatles songs. Salah was so fascinated that after the show he hugged Samer, and they started their musical journey. In 1995 they traveled to Bahrain and with drummer Amr Khairy formed a trio that played cover songs. When they returned to Cairo seven years later, they played original compositions at a jazz festival hosted by the Cairo Jazz Club. By this time, ney player Hany El Badry had become a member of the band. In February 2002, Eftekasat was introduced at the Jazz Festival at the Cairo Jazz Club, joined by a vocalist, Hany Adel. After Cairo Jazz Club, recording of the demo started with the addition of percussionist Hany Bedair. The demo was sent to Bansko International Jazz Festival in Bulgaria and they were invited to perform there. Later, the band started putting music together for Mo'taz El Demerdash's talk show with vocalist Amr Yehia and performed in several international festivals in Arab countries. The band noticed the way audiences interacted with them and decided to become an instrumental group. The six members became Eftekasat. The name comes from a slang term for spontaneity that was popular with young people in Cairo. In January 2006, Eftekasat was awarded a production grant of $3500 from the Culture Resource \\"Al-Mawred Al Thaqafy\\" and recorded their first album, Mouled Sidi El-Latini, which required an fund of $11000. Set in Media Production City Studios, the recording started in April 2006 and ended in July of the same year. Mixing was made at Sound Design, Amr Yehia's studio, while the sound engineers were Amr Yehia and Alaa El Kashef. American composer Daryl Kennedy, who sometimes shared a stage with the band, produced the album. Besides the fact that Mouled Sidi El-Latini was released internationally, Eftekasat became international when they were invited to perform at the 2008 Carthage Jazz Festival in Tunis, performing with Gilberto Gil from Brazil, the Portuguese Maria João & Mário Laginha, William Parker from the U.S., Dhafer Youssef from Tunis, the Italian Gino Paoli, the Frenchman Jacques Schwarz-Bart, and the Englishman Murray Head. Influences Although Amro Salah is the composer of the group, Ousso the guitarist has also contributed in writing some of the songs. Their influences had a great impact on Eftekasat, especially Amro's, which included classical, jazz, pop and rock. His mother had a great impact, as she worked as a classical piano teacher and he began playing classical music. Other influences include Omar Khairat, Algerian Mohamed El Anka, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, McCoy Tyner, Lyle Mays, Spyro Gyra, Yellowjackets, Ziad Rahbani, Frank Zappa, and The Beatles, who had a great impact on him. Before he played jazz, he memorized, played, and sang Beatles songs. Salah's ambition is to become internationally recognized like Chick Corea's Electric Group or Spyro Gyra. The group regularly performs at Cairo Opera House, Bibliotheca Alexandrina, Cairo Jazz Club, and \\"Sakia\\" (El Sawy Culturewheel) \\"ساقية الصاوى\\".

Sui Generis, was initially formed in 1969 by Charly García (keyboards and vocals), Nito Mestre (guitar, flute and vocals), Rolando Fortich (bass guitar), Juan Belia (guitar), Alberto Rodriguez (drums) and Carlos Piegari (vocals). Later on, Sui Generis became a duo as everyone left except for García. After the band split in 1975, Nito Mestre formed a new band called \\"Nito Mestre y los Desconocidos de Siempre\\" with María Rosa Yorio on vocals, Rodolfo Gorosito on guitar, Alfredo Toth on bass, Ciro Fogliatta on keyboards and Juan Carlos \\"Mono\\" Fontana as a drummer. In the early 80s, Nito pursued a solo career. Biography =Early years= Throughout its five years of existence, Sui Generis sold a record 600,000 albums, a statistic which in those early days of rock and roll in Argentina, clearly marked the importance and the impact which the duo would have on the local scene. Initially formed in 1969, the band consisted of Charly García (keyboards and vocals), Nito Mestre (guitar, flute and vocals), Rolando Fortich (bass guitar), Juan Belia (guitar), Alberto Rodríguez (drums) and Carlos Piégari (vocals). Charly and Nito had met during their third year at high school. They both had their own bands: Charly, together with Rodríguez and Correa, had formed \\"To Walk a Spanish\\" and Nito, together with Piégari, formed and was the lead singer in \\"The Century Indignation\\". As a sextet, the band made its debut on the stage of the Santa Rosa School in Buenos Aires in 1969, but the group would undergo many changes until it finally became an acoustic duet. In 1970, they performed at a series of small venues and that same year, they made their first TV appearance on Channel 7, endorsed by a renowned artist called Eduardo Falú. Soon after, they traveled to Mar del Plata where they co-started with songwriter Litto Nebbia. In May 1971, they took part a series of concerts that would become the turning point in their careers. For almost two months, they performed alongside the bigger tickets: Roque Narvaja and Pedro y Pablo with guest stars, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Héctor Starc and Emilio Del Guercio, among others. After having been turned down by various record labels, Sui Generis Manager Pierre Bayona contacted Microfon Producer, Jorge Álvarez, whom, after a test performance, signed the group on with his record label. Mestre (left) and Charly García photographed in the beginning of their careers with Sui Generis Their debut album was called \\"Vida\\" (Life) having among others, guest musicians like violinist Jorge Pinchevsky, bass guitar player Alejandro Medina and Claudio Gabis on the electric guitar. Recording was completed in October, 1972. The band then made two significant performances. One, again at the Olympia Theatre alongside Raul Porchetto, the other late that year at the third edition of the Buenos Aires Rock Festival (B.A.Rock). With the performance of Canción Para Mi Muerte, eventually one of their most popular songs, they appeared in the movie \\"Hasta que se Ponga el Sol\\" (Until the Sun Sets) directed by Aníbal Uset, the first Argentine film to address rock n' roll, shot during that festival. As a preview to the album, the Record Company released a single with both Canción para mi Muerte and Amigo Vuelve a Casa Pronto. The official release of the album took place at the conspicuous Buenos Aires Opera Theatre in April 1973. The repercussion was enormous. In May, Francisco \\"Paco\\" Pratti (drums) and Alejandro Correa (bass) joined Nito and Charly in the band. One month later, they returned to the studio to record Aprendizaje (Learning) and Bienvenidos al Tren (Welcome to the Train), the first two songs in the second album, called \\"Confesiones de Invierno\\" (Winter Confessions) which was completed in August. It included recordings by David Lebón on guitar and Leon Gieco, and was released in October. In the summer of 1974, they went on a very successful tour to Córdoba, Mar del Plata, Punta del Este and Santa Fe. On their return, Juan Rodríguez replaced Pratti on drums. He would later become a part of Nito's band Nito Mestre y Los Desconocidos de Siempre. After many months of rehearsing, they began the recording of their third album. It was titled \\"Pequeñas Anécdotas sobre las Instituciones\\" (Small Anecdotes about the Institutions). This album faced problems with censorship which in those days was obsessed with the political persecution of both young and old artists. As a result, some songs had to be replaced by others. Such was the case with Juan Represión (John Repression) which was replaced by Tango en Segunda and El Tuerto y Los Ciegos (The One-Eyed and the Blind) which replaced Botas Locas (Crazy Boots). On other songs, lyrics had to be rewritten: Instituciones (Institutions), Las Increíbles Aventuras del Sr. Tijeras (The Incredible Adventures of Mr. Scissors) and Para Quién Canto Yo Entonces (Whom Do I Sing For Then). On this occasion, David Lebón, Jorge Pinchevsky and León Gieco were all invited to take part in the recordings. Mestre c. 1975 From this moment on, Charly Garcia begins to experiment with new instruments that had been brought from the United States: a moog, an ARP string synthesizer and a Fender Rhodes keyboard. In those days, it was an audacious move, and gave the album more of an electronic sound. While recordings were taking place, the band took part in the recording and staging of \\"La Biblia\\" (The Bible) by Vox Dei together with Billy Bond, David Lebón, Espíritu (band)Espíritu and La Pesada del Rock. After this presentation, bass player Rinaldo Rafanelli replaced Alejandro Correa. The new songs were first performed on December 13 at the Teatro Coliseo to an audience of 1800 spectators. The album was released three days later and had already sold over 30,000 copies before it hit the stores. During the winter of 1975, Charly and Nito went on the PorSuiGieco Tour with María Rosa Yorio, Raúl Porchetto and León Gieco. Meanwhile, Rafanelli and Correa joined Lebón in an experience that later became Polifemo. When touring was over, Charly, sick and tired of having to deal with censorship, proposed that the group be dissolved in order to keep it from wearing out. Together with Nito, they decided to try their luck abroad but two months down the road, Nito had to agree with Charly that the time had come for the duo to separate. They began to rehearse for a great goodbye concert. The show is still remembered to this day. On the September 5th, 1975 at the Luna Park Stadium in two consecutive performances before a record audience of 30,000 people, Sui Generis bade farewell to its followers on a memorable night. From the Concert, there was a movie made. It was called \\"Adiós, Sui Generis\\", directed by Bebe Kamin, under the supervision of the great Leopoldo Torre Nilsson. The film was released on September 2, 1976 at the Plaza Cinema and was rated by the authorities, still under the supervision of Miguel Paulino (\\"Tato\\"), the Mr. Scissors from the song, as an X rated movie. Finally, the band departed doing a small tour of the province of Buenos Aires and these were to become Sui Generis' last performances before their final separation. In December 2000 Nito and Charly got back together again for a series of concerts to mark the 25th Anniversary of the band. =Solo career= Nito Mestre with his band, \\"Los Desconocidos de Siempre\\" formed after the Sui Generis disolution, c. 1976 \\"Nito Mestre and Los Desconocidos de Siempre\\" was formed in early 1976, after Sui Generis had finally separated. During its early stage, the band was formed by María Rosa Yorio, Alfredo Toth, Rodolfo Gorosito, Francisco Pratti, Osvaldo Calo and Mestre himself. Their first album was recorded at ION Studios in Buenos Aires in 1976 and was released on September 6 in a show at the Estrellas Theatre with a series of performances that lasted for two months. The band was one of the few rock groups to play such a significant number of live gigs during those days. It was awarded the prize for the best folk group of the year and Nito won the Best Rock Singer title for his third consecutive year. The departure of Osvaldo Calo from the band – he was invited to play with Astor Piazzola in France - marked the arrival of a series of pianists like Alejandro Lerner, Eduardo Zvetelman and finally Ciro Fogliata, ex keyboard player for the renowned Los Gatos. The band's second album was recorded between Argentina and Brazil in 1978 and was followed by a two-month tour of Brazil together with Leon Gieco and Crucis. On their return to Buenos Aires, the band performed at the Luna Park and in 1979, Nito Mestre and Los Desconocidos de Siempre recorded SALTABA SOBRE LAS NUBES (Jumping Over the Clouds), an LP that made record sales that year. Ciro Fogliata later emigrated to Spain and was replaced by Mono Fontana who played first the drums and then piano, leaving the drum work to Claudio Martinez, former member of Espiritu. In 1980, after having made a great many live presentations both in Argentina and abroad, Los DESCONOCIDOS DE SIEMPRE dismembered in August. Mestre embarked on a solo career that same year with the hit album 20/10. In 1981, Mestre reappeared on the music scene with both a new band and a new album: 20/10, another gold record that was first performed on stage at the Ferro Carril Oeste Football Stadium in a sold-out concert. The concert marked a turning point in his career and he embarked on a 52-show tour up and down the country (Argentina) as well as an important appearance in Montevideo, Uruguay alongside Seru Giran. In 1982 he records Nito Mestre en Vivo (Live), in Montevideo Uruguay, and receives yet another gold record for the album. Between 1983 and 1985, he traveled outside his native Argentina to Peru and other neighbouring countries, playing as a solo artist for the first time. After Nito finished recording his third solo album Escondo Mis Ojos Al Sol (Hiding My Eyes from the Sun) and concluded a series of national and international tours, in 1984 he joined Juan Carlos Baglietto, Oveja Negra and Celeste Carballo on a tour designed to explain: “Por Que Cantamos” (Why We Sing), inspired in the words of the Uruguayan Poet Mario Benedetti. This performance made a significant contribution to the meaning of Rock ‘n Roll in Argentina: “We sing in the name of love, freedom and life.” The spirit behind the tour took them all around the country and abroad. In November of that same year, the tour was consolidated in a doble album of the same name, “Por Que Cantamos” recorded live at the Coliseum Theatre in Buenos Aires. In October 1986, the fourth solo album, NITO, was released. This work reunited such artists as Mercedes Sosa, the renowned folklore singer, Charly Garcia, Andres Calamaro, Fito Paez and Celeste Carballo. Nito, the album, was also released In Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Chile, Peru, Uruguay and Bolivia. It was until 1988, that Nito traveled all over the region presenting his work with enormous repercussion. In 1989, he set himself up in Chile to tour the country with important local artists such as Los Jaivas, Congreso and his friend Eduardo Gatti with whom he later recorded Entrada de Locos (Locos For Starters). In 1990, he returned to Argentina where he began work on his album Tocando El Cielo (Reaching for the Sky), which he himself produced. During that time, Mestre experimented in the making of his own videos alongside the celebrated Alfredo Lois. In 1993, he recorded the techno and dance versions of Rasguña Las Piedras with David Lebon, something that to this days still surprises Nito’s listeners. Later that year, he would start working on Nito Canta Sui in Miami and Los Angeles together with a cast of musicians of extraordinary talent and international repute. These included Julian Navarro, also the producer, John Robinson (drums), Larry Coryel (guitar), Abraham Laboriel (base), Alex Acuna (percussion) Tom Scott (Saxophone), the Los Angeles String Ensemble amongst other virtuosos in the world of music. This album gave Mestre the opportunity of a lifetime to record the old Sui Generis classic songs to the sounds of the modern age. Nito has also performed these songs to the most enthusiastic of audiences all over Latin America and even to this day, he continues to perform the symphonic version of the songs with classical orchestras around Argentina. During the last decade, Nito has also had the honor and pleasure of being invited to open acts for the great international stars and his very own favourite musicians of all times. Amongst them, Paul Simon (1991), Elton John (1992) and the larger than life Paul McCartney (1994) with whom he remains friends to this day. In 1997, he plays in a series of international festivals in Chile and Peru and in 1999, under his own record label Discos Tekla, he releases Colores Puros (Pure Colors). This gem of an album is a compilation of beautiful songs, some written by the likes of Fito Paez, Miguel Zavaleta, Silvio Rodriguez and one in duo with his inseparable friend Leon Gieco. The record stands out for its profound message, its high production quality and the emphasis in Nito’ s characteristic tone of voice. In the year 2000 and after 25 years of music, came the very long-awaited reunion and album with Charly Garcia. Nito and Charly decided to get together for a series of concerts to please not only their followers of the seventies but their children and their children’s children, three generations gathered on a memorable occasion at the Boca Juniors Football Stadium. The result an album entitled “Sinfonias para Adolescentes” (Symphonies for Teenagers). A great record followed by “Si” which is yet another living proof of the chemistry between the two artists. Mestre in 2007 Recently, Sony Argentina released a doble album commemorating Nito’s 30th Anniversary with music, a doble album called ‘Anos” (Years). The record was performed at the Billboard on Miami’s Ocean Drive in 2002. Nito Mestre has just concluded work on his album number 22, in Miami, USA. Only recently, Nito Mestre finished recording his most recent album which has still to be given a name. The songs were carefully chosen : Ven Al Jardin (Come to the Garden) was written and recorded with the lead singer of La Ley, Beto Cuevas; as in previous works, Leon Gieco is also present in the album in Veo Tus Ojos (I See Your Eyes) with his characteristic voice and the magical notes that spring from his harmonicas. Alejandro Lerner also did his part in the song \\"Me Dijeron\\" (They Told Me So) as did Eduardo Cautinio from Puerto Rico and Cris Zalles from Chile who wrote the music and lyrics of \\"Recordando lo que Tengo que Olvidar\\" (Remembering That Which I Have To Forget) song in which Ale Lerner also contributed with the piano and harmonies, and the lyrics of \\"Hay formas de llegar\\" and \\"El fin del mundo\\". Nito Mestre wrote the music of 5 songs in this album, and a couple of lyrics, too. Ernesto Salgueiro was present throughout the recording sessions in Argentina on guitar, Andres Dulcet on base and Diego Ferrar played drums on two of the tracks. The album – produced by Pablo Manavello – was recorded in two separate phases: the first in the Miami Studios of Iker Gastaminza and the second at El Pie in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Mestre currently finds himself tweezing and tweaking the very last details of the project before releasing this new material to the public. “I want the album to be treated with the love and affection we all poured into it when we were putting it together...” says Mestre. And everything seems to indicate that he is right for the unreleased 10 track album, has aroused very good reviews and the acceptance of the general public both in the United States and Latin America where Nito, on occasions has played some of the new songs to his diverse audience. A number of solo albums followed (as of January 2008, Mestre has released over 9 recordings under his own name), and continues to record and perform. Nito is currently touring South, Central and North America presenting his latest CD, DVD \\"Nito Mestre Completo: En Vivo\\", recorded live in Buenos Aires; at the Teatro Ateneo released in 2007.

They forecast the cloud cover, transparency and astronomical seeing, parameters which are not forecast by civil or aviation forecasts.A. Danko., \\"'A Weather Clock for Observers'\\", Sky and Telescope Apr 2003; 62; They forecast hourly data, but are limited to forecasting at most 48 hours into the future. Each individual chart provides data for only a 9 mile radius, and so are essentially point forecasts. There are clear sky chart forecasts for over 5300 locations, though the coverage area is limited to Canada, the USA and parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. Locations are typically cities, professional and public observatories, colleges and science centers. However there are also clear sky charts for star parties and backyard observatories. Sample image of a clear sky clock for one particular observatory. History In 2000, Allan Rahill, a meteorologist at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) and amateur astronomer, created a forecast processing step that took data from CMC's Global Element Multi-scale (GEM) forecast model and created a new forecast of cloud cover.*Ivan Semeniuk., \\"STARSTRUCK: Clear Sky Clock\\", Daily Planet, Discovery Channel. April 15, 2005 Rahill specially designed his cloud forecast to consider the formation of cirrus clouds. The cirrus cloud modeling distinguishes Rahill's model from other cloud forecast models, as sufficient cirrus clouds to make a night unusable for astronomers is still called \\"clear\\" by civil weather forecasts. In later years, Rahill added a forecast of astronomical transparency, which is a measure of how much starlight traverses the Earth's atmosphere when otherwise free of clouds. Rahill also added a forecast of astronomical seeing which uses forecast data of turbulence and temperature gradients in the atmosphere to forecast its optical steadiness. In 2001, Attilla Danko, computer programmer and amateur astronomer, began to summarize Rahill's hundreds of forecast maps by displaying only one pixel, from each map, laid out in rows.Lydia Lousteaux., \\"'Interview with the creators of the Clear Sky Clock'\\" astronomytoday.com; The resulting meteogram, called a clear sky chart, showed all of Rahill's forecast data, but for only one location. Danko writes \\"It shows at a glance when, in the next 48 hours, we might expect clear and dark skies for one specific observing site\\". Danko accepts requests from observatories and private individuals to create new CSCs for locations not currently covered.\\"The Clear Sky Clock\\" Sky News magazine. #54  Volume IX, Issue 6  March/April, 2004 However, since CMC's GEM model only covers North America, CSCs are limited to North America. =Name change= On February 29, 2008 Danko changed the name of the CSCs to \\"clear sky charts\\" to avoid any possibility of legal action on the part of Skyclock company of Michigan who owns a USA registered trademark on the name \\"SKYCLOCK\\".\\"'Clear Sky Chart FAQ: Why the name change?'\\"; cleardarksky.com; Danko's attorney opined that he was not infringing Skyclock Company's trademark, but also advised that changing the name was the \\"least painful\\" and least \\"expensive\\" solution.\\"'Clear Sky Chart News'\\"; Feb 29, 2008; cleardarksky.com; However, there continue to be references to the old name on web sites not controlled by the domain cleardarksky.com. =Alternative Services= In January of 2017, Astrospheric was created to summarize Rahill's astronomy forecast and make better use of the increased data output from the CMC's Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS). While both Clear Sky Charts and Astrospheric display similar data, Astrospheric uses the underlying binary data to provide wind direction, dew point temperatures, and improved Transparency forecasts, \\"'Improved data availability'\\" all using bi-linear interpolation of model data. \\"'Bilinear interpolated map data'\\" Astrospheric also generates forecasts dynamically which allows for a visual forecast to be built for any location within the RDPS window instead of using pre-defined locations. Recognition Rahill and Danko have received awards from meteorological and astronomical organizations: *In 2010, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific awarded their Amateur Achievement Award to Allan Rahill on behalf of the Clear Sky Chart team composed of Allan Rahill and Attilla Danko.http://www.astrosociety.org/membership/awards/10winnerspub.html *In 2009, Asteroid discoverer Andrew Lowe named asteroids 161693 Attilladanko (2006 HL46) and 171153 Allanrahill (2005 GL81) in recognition of Danko's and Rahill's forecasts. *In 2004, the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society (CMOS) granted a citation to Rahill and Danko for a \\"vivid example of meteorology in support of astronomy\\".CMOS Prizewinners 2004 / Lauréats des prix de la SCMO, 2004 *In 2005, the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada awarded Danko the Ken Chilton Prize in recognition of the \\"Clear Sky Clock\\". *In 2003, the Astronomical League awarded Danko the Omega Centauri Award for making observing more efficient through the clear sky clock.TSP History Since the clear sky charts terms of use permit non-commercial web sites to display clear sky chart images, they are most commonly recognized by private and club astronomy websites in North America.

Population: History Kalashnikovo was first mentioned in 1779 as a village belonging to the selo of Yegoryevskoye. At the time, it belonged to Novotorzhsky Uyezd of Tver Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was transformed to Tver Governorate. The village has grown considerably after the railway construction was completed in 1851, and even more after the glass factory has been constructed in 1886—1887. In 1918, the factory was nationalized. On July 12, 1929 the governorates and uyezds were abolished. Likhoslavlsky District, with the administrative center in Likhoslavl, was established within Tver Okrug of Moscow Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. In 1932, Kalashnikovo was granted urban-type settlement status. On January 29, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Likhoslavlsky District was transferred to Kalinin Oblast. On July 9, 1937 Likhoslavlsky District was included into Karelian National Okrug, which was established as a Tver Karelians autonomy. On February 7, 1939 the okrug was abolished. In February 1963, during the abortive administrative reform by Nikita Khrushchev, Likhoslavlsky District was merged into Torzhoksky District, but on March 4, 1964 it was re-established.

It is the oldest bus operator in the Philippines and in Asia. It is also the only bus carrier with a nationwide public transport franchise. Philtranco currently has more than 250 buses for its operations. History Philtranco was established in 1914 when Mr. Albert Louis Ammen and Mr. Max Blouse organized the AL Ammen Transportation Company (ALATCO), operating passenger buses from Iriga to Naga. In 1958, ownership was transferred to the Tuason family, and just before Martial Law, in 1971, to the Mantrade Group. It was then known as Pantranco South Express, Inc. (PSEI) Creditors took over and re-engineered the company in 1974, enabling a financial turnaround despite the series of financial setbacks that hit the country in the eighties. By 1979, the company expanded its coverage to the eastern Visayas region and went into ferry operations at the San Bernardino Strait three years after. In 1984, the company formally changed its name to Philtranco Service Enterprises, Inc. Two years later, in 1986, the LUZVIMINDA run was launched. This was the first archipelago-wide bus-cum-ferry operation which finally united the islands of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Soon after, both cargo truck and air-conditioned bus services followed with the company’s Mindanao expansion.

The pilot episode aired on Adult Swim on May 13, 2007. The series premiered on November 23, 2008 and ended its run on January 25, 2009. The cancellation of the show was confirmed by a Maakies comic.http://www.maakies.com/?attachment_id=54 Dino Stamatopoulos provided the voice of the title character and David Herman the voices of Uncle Gabby and Captain Maak. Millionaire's wife Becky Thyre co-starred as the voice of the Captain's Daughter and Phoebe Bird. Pamela Adlon provided the voice of Mademoiselle DeBoursay, as well as many of the other female characters. Creators Tony Millionaire and Eric Kaplan also provided additional voices. They Might Be Giants perform the show's theme song. Setting The show centers on Drinky Crow (an often drunk crow) and Uncle Gabby described as a drunken Irish monkey. It has a 19th-century nautical setting, where the main characters are constantly at war with the French, who are mostly alligators. It is characterized by graphic violence and surreal humor, so it normally is rated TV-MA-V for graphic violence. Production The animation is somewhat unusual in that, although it is CGI-animated and rendered in 3D using Maya, its resolution and its color palette are deliberately kept low. This gives the show a more traditional cel-animated look, reminiscent of 1950s children's TV cartoon shows. Matt Danner and Eddie Trigeruos are show animators, while physical production is handled at Mirari Films. Characters * Drinky Crow (Dino Stamatopoulos) - A desperate, depressed, tormented, romantic, suicidal, alcoholic crow. * Uncle Gabby (David Herman) - A self-centered, stubborn, overweight Irish monkey who is only after girls and booze. He tends to only think of himself and sometimes tries to manipulate Drinky Crow. * Phoebe Bird (Becky Thyre) - Drinky Crow's on-again, off-again, long-suffering sober seagull girlfriend. She used to date a walrus, but lost interest with him as he kept bringing his work home. * Captain Maak (David Herman) - The brutal, lash-wielding captain of the boat Drinky Crow and Uncle Gabby work on. He is an American who does not care much for Uncle Gabby. He will only allow homosexuals near his daughter. * Captain's Daughter (Becky Thyre) - A flirtatious, barefooted, sadistic, Betty Boop-style character who, like her title says, is the captain's daughter. Her real name is never given and the characters refer to her as \\"Captain's Daughter\\" (which is likely her real name). Her hobbies include never bathing and flossing her teeth while taking dumps. * Lieutenant Vronchy (Dino Stamatopoulos) - An evil alligator who also is a naval captain for France. * Mademoiselle DeBoursay (Pamela Adlon) - The French spy who works for Lieutenant Vronchy. She is able to sneak in and out mostly by seducing Uncle Gabby and Drinky Crow. * Veteran Adult Swim voice actor George Lowe, played many background characters, but did not receive credit on any of the episodes. Episodes =Pilot (2007)= =Season 1 (2008–09)= Home release Although The Drinky Crow Show has never been released on DVD, all episodes, excluding the pilot, are available on iTunes.

WMPL exists as an international community of approximately 6,000 members with formal offices in the United States (Minneapolis, Minnesota) and Canada (Camrose, Alberta). The Prayer League supports approximately 120 workers serving in twenty countries throughout Africa, Asia, North America, and South America.  History  The first international workers were sent in 1904 by the World Mission Prayer League's predecessor agency, The American Board of the Santal Mission. They joined the Santal Mission work in India, sponsored by sister agencies in Norway and Denmark, which had been under way since 1867. By the mid-1930s, a band of students, pastors, and friends in the Minneapolis, Minnesota, area joined together to approach the foreign mission boards of the existing Lutheran synods, but they found no budget for new outreach. In 1937, they organized themselves to accept missionary volunteers and send them into areas of special concern, without the constraint of budgetary limitations. They were committed to providing a way for lay participation in mission, without the requirement of ordination, and to complement the regular work of the Lutheran synods, without diverting means or personnel from their programs. The mission was formally organized on May 25, 1937, as the South American Mission Prayer League. Its first two missionaries left the next year for Bolivia. Later, other volunteers were sent to Central Asia, and eventually to Africa, and Eastern Europe. In 1939, the Mission adopted its present name, the World Mission Prayer League, to reflect its growing involvements around the world. In 1945, the League adopted its constitution and incorporated in the state of Minnesota. In 1969, a sister organization, the World Mission Prayer League/Canada, adopted its constitution and incorporated in Edmonton, Alberta. In 1972, the American Board of the Santal Mission merged with the World Mission Prayer League. The American Board had been founded in Minneapolis in 1894, as the American partner of the Norwegian Board and the Danish Board of the same Mission.

The term covers a broad class of spirits produced across the world, and typically excludes beverages made from grapes, which are referred to as plain brandy (when made from distillation from wine) or pomace brandy (when made directly from grape pomace). Apples, pears, apricots, plums and cherries are the most commonly used fruits. Definition According to a legal definition in the United States, a \\"fruit brandy\\" is distilled \\"solely from the fermented juice or mash of whole, sound, ripe fruit, or from standard grape, citrus, or other fruit wine, with or without the addition of not more than 20 percent by weight of the pomace of such juice or wine, or 30 percent by volume of the lees of such wine, or both.\\" In the European Union, fruit spirits may not be labeled as \\"fruit brandy\\"; instead, the legal English denomination is fruit spirit, which is \\"produced exclusively by the alcoholic fermentation and distillation of fleshy fruit or must of such fruit, berries or vegetables, with or without stones\\".While this category legally includes vegetable spirits, the latter, too, must be labeled truthfully according to mash ingredients. For example: \\"vegetable spirit\\" or \\"carrot spirit\\", etc. A great number of European fruit spirits have a protected designation of origin, and are labeled with their respective protected names instead of \\"fruit spirit\\" (\\"apricot spirit\\", etc.). Cider spirit and perry spirit (fruit spirit distilled from cider or perry) form a separate legal category. Some fruit spirits may be labeled with alternative names such as kirsch (cherry spirit) or slivovitz (plum spirit) regardless their country of origin. The term Cider Brandy is PGI protected within Europe and The United Kingdom and refers specifically to the products of the Somerset Cider Brandy Company; these Cider Brandies are mainly sold at 42% ABV alongside a number of derivative products.www.ciderbrandy.co.uk In British usage, \\"fruit brandy\\" may also refer to liqueurs obtained by maceration of whole fruits, juice or flavoring in a distilled beverage, and such liqueurs are legally labeled as \\"cherry brandy\\", \\"apricot brandy\\" etc. all across the European Union. Such beverages are used similar to cordials, and as an ingredient in cocktails and cakes. Fruit spirits obtained by distillation are often referred by the French term eau de vie. Fruit spirit usually contains 40% to 45% ABV (80 to 90 US proof). It is often colourless. Fruit spirit is customarily drunk chilled or over ice, but is occasionally mixed.

For example: Schwarzwälder Kirschwasser (cherry spirit of the Black Forest), Framboise d'Alsace (raspberry of Alsace), Aprikot dell'Alto Adige (apricot of South Tyrol), etc. They are often regulated more strictly than generic fruit spirits; other than limiting their region of origin, restrictions may include fruit variants, mashing and fermenting technology, distilling apparatus, barrel aging, etc. Among the better known fruit spirits are: *Applejack is an American apple spirit made from the distillation of hard cider.

In 1466, he published the first printed Bible in the German language, the .  Life  In 1447, Johannes Mentelin gained the rights of a Strasbourg citizen. He was first a Goldschreiber (calligrapher and book scribe) by profession and worked in addition as an episcopal notary. Exactly when and where he learned the technique of book printing is not known. Since at the end of the 1450s, when Mentelin founded his Strasbourg printery, there was still no other place where printing was done besides Mainz, it is likely that he either got his knowledge directly there or through a middleman. Such a go-between might have been Heinrich Eggestein. It is suspected that he had been introduced to the trade of book printing during his stay in Mainz from Johannes Gutenberg. He did not set up his own Offizin (an old German term for a book printery) until the middle of the 1460s. Due to a lack of sources, the final clarification of this question must unfortunately remain unanswered for now. From the available data, it can however be concluded that Mentelin was the first book printer active in Strasbourg (and thus one of the first anywhere in Europe), even before Eggestein. The first printing which carries Mentelin's name is Augustine's Tractatus de arte praedicandi from the year 1465. However, it is assumed that Mentelin had already begun to print significantly earlier, probably even already in 1458. His oldest known printed work is a Latin Bible printed with 49 lines per page (\\"B49\\"), whose first volume is dated 1460. As Gutenberg's Bible was printed with 42 lines per page, Mentelin's had fewer pages and proved handier. Mentelin quickly achieved business success, which made him a prosperous man. In 1466, he was even awarded a coat of arms by Emperor Frederick III. After about 20 years as a book printer, Mentelin died on December 12, 1478 in Strasbourg. He was buried in the cemetery of the (no longer existing) St.-Michael's-Chapel. His grave was later removed and is now inside Strasbourg Cathedral. His two daughters married the book printers, Martin Schott and Adolf Rusch. The latter, also called the printer with the bizarre R, took over the Offizin.  Work  About 40 printed works are ascribed to Mentelin's Strasbourg Offizin. His printing and publishing list contained predominantly theological and philosophical works in Latin, whose purity of text was ensured by scholarly proofreaders. Among others, works of Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Aristotle, John Chrysostom, Isidore of Seville and Albertus Magnus were issued. In 1472 he published the Postilla super totam Bibliam, Nicolaus de Lyra's commentary of the Bible. Mentelin also published texts of classical antiquity (such as Virgil's Opera and the Comoediae of Terence). As the only German book printer, Mentelin printed Medieval court literature, such as Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival and Der jüngere Titurel (\\"The Younger Titurel\\") of Albrecht von Scharfenberg. His first printing of a Bible in vernacular language stands out, the so-called Mentelin Bible of 1466, the first attested edition of the full Bible in the German language, translated from the Vulgate, and one of the earliest printed works in German. The Mentelin Bible was the basis for a further thirteen pre-Reformation editions of the Bible (including those by Zainer and Sorg) which appeared in southern Germany before editions of the Luther Bible, based on Hebrew and Greek, from 1522.

News accounts indicated his mission was to report on air developments in the Russo-Finnish War (where the harsh winter conditions provided a special opportunity to observe the interplay between meteorology and military aeronautics). As the German armed forces began their Norwegian Campaign, Losey was directed first to Sweden, then to Norway. After arriving in Norway he immediately became involved in efforts to evacuate the American legation to safety across the Swedish border. The American legation was divided into two parties. The first party, including Losey and U.S. Minister Florence Jaffray Harriman, reached Sweden safely but had lost contact with the second party. Losey volunteered to return to Norway in search of the remainder of the American legation.

Seeking out the Americans, Losey and the chauffeur passed through Dombås, a strategic railway intersection, just as a German Luftwaffe bombing began. The two sought refuge in a railway tunnel with others, but once in the tunnel Losey stood where he could observe the bombing. After a bomb fell near the entrance to the tunnel, a fragment of it pierced Losey's heart, killing him. In addition to Losey, five Norwegians were killed by the bomb, and 18 wounded. Several days later, Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring sent to Major General Arnold a message of regret regarding Losey's death.\\"Nazis Regret Losey's Death,\\" Oakland Tribune, 1940-04-26, at D3.

It was first published when it was included in the Five New Plays of 1653,Not to be confused with the Brome collection of 1659 published by Andrew Crooke and Henry Brome, also titled Five New Plays. the collection of Brome works published by Humphrey Moseley, Richard Marriot, and Thomas Dring. Date and performance There is no firm evidence on the date of The City Wit; scholars and critics have generally judged the play to be one of Brome \\"earliest surviving\\" plays.Steggle, p. 37. It probably dates from c. 1629–32. The acting company that premiered it is similarly unknown – though early in his career Brome was writing for the King's Men, the troupe that staged his The Northern Lass in 1629. City Wit, like Northern Lass, is unusually rich in music: in the former drama, the boy player filling the role of Crack sings no less than a dozen times. The title role of Constance in Northern Lass shows a comparable richness in music. It is not impossible that both plays were staged by the King's Men, and even that both musical roles were acted by the same vocally talented boy actor. Genre and influences The City Wit fits securely into the subgenre of city comedy, and draws upon the rich tradition of earlier city comedies for many of its elements. One obvious debt is to Thomas Dekker and John Webster's Westward Ho (c. 1604). In that play, the London merchant Justiniano faces business difficulties and a rocky marriage; he pretends to leave London but in fact remains in the city to assume various disguises to manipulate the other characters. Brome adopts this plot wholesale for City Wit. Given Brome's strong allegiance to the comedy of Ben Jonson, it is not surprising to find Jonsonian elements in the play too. In fact, City Wit has been termed Brome's \\"most overtly Jonsonian comedy.\\"Woolland, p. 88. In Act III, scene i, Crack specifically compares the play's three charlatan characters, Master Crasy, himself, and Mistress Tryman, to Subtle, Face, and Doll in The Alchemist. In turn, Brome's derivative play spawned a derivation of its own: Restoration playwright George Powell's comedy A Very Good Wife, staged and printed in 1693, borrowed heavily from The City Wit and from Brome's The Court Beggar. \\"Place realism\\" The City Wit shows the same tendency that Brome displays in other works, like The Weeding of Covent Garden and The Sparagus Garden, of exploiting the actual locations of London for the settings of his scenes. In City Wit he carries this tendency to a surprisingly bold extreme, setting one scene (IV, ii) in the presence chamber at the court of King Charles I,Matthew Steggle, \\"Placing Caroline politics on the professional comic stage,\\" in Atherton and Sanders, pp. 154–170; see p. 157. where he has his characters argue and brawl. Synopsis Master Crasy is a London merchant who has suffered a decline in fortune; he is honest and generous to a fault and has encumbered himself with a load of debt. In the play's opening scene, a dinner is being held at his house for his debtors and creditors; the plan is that the two sides will reach an agreement that will keep Crasy from bankruptcy. Crasy himself, however, hesitates to join the dinner; he sits poring over his \\"empty Money-bags, Bills, Bonds, & Bookes of accomptes, &c.;\\" and brooding on his decline. His apprentice Jeremy then brings him the news that the dinner has turned into a disaster: Crasy's mother-in-law Pyannet Sneakup, a shrew and harridan, has denounced him to the assembled company as a hopeless case: \\"Her mischievous tongue has over-thrown the good / Was meant to you.\\" The woman herself enters and reveals herself to be a ceaseless talker who browbeats her husband Sneakup into silence in her presence. Several of Crasy's debtors linger, including the pedant Sarpego, the courtiers Rufflit and Sir Andrew Ticket, and the merchant Mr. Linsey-Wolsey. Crasy makes a last attempt to get them to pay what they owe him, but without success. Crasy announces that he is leaving on a journey, a final attempt to restore his fortunes; he gives his apprentice Jeremy his freedom. Crasy's wife Josina returns to her parents' home. Crasy's departure, however, is a ruse; he remains in London to seek his revenge and the restoration of his credit. Disguised as a crippled ex-soldier, he robs Sarpego at sword-point and recovers the ten pounds the pedant owes him. Crasy's next disguise is more subtle: with a false beard and a gown, he masquerades as a physician, \\"Pulsefeel,\\" who seeks out Josina as his new patient. She shows no remorse over her husband's fall and is ready to move on to new fortunes and pleasures. Josina is handicapped by her illiteracy: she cannot read the love-letters and solicitations that Rufflit and Ticket send her. Crasy, as \\"Pulsefeel,\\" promises to send a confidential servant to help her. Crasy the phony doctor is approached by Crack, a boy pimp in the service of a young woman calling herself Mistress Tryman. Tryman is a fallen woman who masquerades as a wealthy young widow, just come to town from Cornwall; she is instantly the target of fortune hunters, and has found a residence in the house of Mr. Linsey-Wolsey. A woman in her position can use a doctor as a confidant; and Crasy quickly joins with Tryman and Crack, three allies in confidence tricks and chicanery. Linsey-Wolsey plans to marry Tryman himself, and lays out money in pursuit of that goal; but his neighbour Pyannet Sneakup barges in to disrupt things, with a goal of winning the supposedly wealthy widow for her son Toby. Tryman feigns sickness and tempts her would-be exploiters with the bequests of her last will and testament. Toby Sneakup has recently won a place at Court; Crasy masquerades as a Court messenger to send false messages back and forth among the characters, playing on their greed and ambition. The talkative Pyannet admits to have cheated Crasy of valuable jewels; the disguised Crasy manages to reclaim them as they pass as intended bribes and gratuities. Crasy manages yet another disguise: Doctor \\"Pulsefeel\\" sends \\"Footwell\\" (Crasy-as-dancing- master) to Josina as her servant. Josina is eager to have a courtly lover, and is willing to accept either Ticket or Rufflit; \\"Footwell\\" pretends to be her go-between, but actually works to frustrate the intentions of all concerned. He inspires Josina to send gems and jewellery to the courtiers, and vice versa...only to intercept the gifts himself. He helps Ticket climb to Josina's balcony for an assignation...only to suspend him in mid-air, so that Rufflit can beat him with a stick. He deludes Pyannet into believing that her husband Sneakup is cheating on her, making her a \\"cucquean\\" (a female cuckold); she goes to court to find Sneakup and beat him with a truncheon. The tangle of confusion and trickery comes to a head in the final act. Linsey-Wolsey, irate at losing the widow Tryman, apprehends Crack and threatens to turn the boy over to the beadles for whipping; and Crack agrees to expose all. At the Sneakup house, a marriage contract between Tryman and Toby Sneakup is arranged, and a marriage masque is rehearsed in which the real situation is revealed, to everyone's discomfort. Linsey-Wolsey bursts in with Crack, planning to expose Tryman as a fraud – but the exposé is even more extreme than expected, when Tryman lifts \\"her\\" skirts to show his trousers underneath. \\"Tryman\\" is actually Crasy's apprentice Jeremy in disguise, and Crack the supposed boy pimp is Jeremy's brother; they have been acting their roles to help Crasy recover his fortune and reputation. (It is in this sense that the play's subtitle, \\"the woman wears the breeches,\\" applies.) Neither Linsey- Wolsey, nor Toby and the Sneakups, want to face public embarrassment over courting a boy in disguise; for all concerned, it is best to let the matter drop. Crasy has cheated his debtors out of the funds they owed him to begin with, and so has evened his score. Josina has not actually committed adultery with either of her would-be lovers, so that a reconciliation with her husband is possible; and Crasy the City Wit has managed to restore himself to his old prosperity once more.

History The Beginning: An ROTC Band (1920-1929): In the fall of 1920, Mr. Ralph A. Van Wye, a student in the College of Engineering, had just returned to the University of Cincinnati after a tour of duty in the US Army during World War I as an army bandsman. At the time, ROTC was compulsory for all male students at the University of Cincinnati. Since Mr. Van Wye had just completed two years of army service, he did not feel obligated to continue as a member of ROTC on campus, requesting to have his requirement waived. However, when the commandant saw that he was an army bandsman, he told Mr. Van Wye that he was just the man they needed. They wanted to organize an ROTC band, but had no one available to serve as bandmaster. Rather than being excused from ROTC, Mr. Van Wye was appointed as bandmaster to the first University of Cincinnati ROTC band. That fall Mr. Ralph A. Van Wye held his first rehearsal in one of the laboratories in the College of Engineering. Eight members were in attendance. Looking back on the group, Mr. Van Wye humorously remarked, \\"The only letter we could form was the letter I\\". Mr. Van Wye continued as band director until his graduation in the spring of 1923. In September 1923, Sergeant Victor Norling transferred from Ft. Thomas, Kentucky to the ROTC detachment at the University of Cincinnati as the second band director. He remained in this position until 1929. Throughout these first nine years, the UC Band was an ROTC band, administered by the ROTC unit. In addition to performing at all ROTC functions, it also presented halftime shows at UC football games. At the Nippert Stadium Dedication Day game between Oberlin College and UC on November 8, 1924, the band made its first appearance in uniforms. In 1925, the bandsmen initiated the idea of the coed band sponsor, and in the same year elected Julia E. Sale their first band sponsor. Candidates from local sororities would be nominated for the band sponsor, who would then be selected each year at the band’s annual Fall banquet. This single female bandmember would provide a social “in” to the world of dating for the all-male band. During Sgt. Norling's tenure as director, the UC Band also began making trips with the team to some of the away football games. The Transitioning Years: A Student Group (1929-1942): In 1929 Colonel R. A. Aderegg, Assistant Dean of the College of Engineering, was appointed faculty advisor to the band. In the fall of 1929, Merrill B. Van Pelt assumed the position of director of the UC Band. At this point the band shifted from an ROTC band to a student activity for all male students on campus. Up to this point, all membership had been from the College of Engineering. Mr. Van Pelt looked to change this and began recruiting students from other colleges. Among his recruiting efforts was the development of the \\"Varsity Vanities\\", a musical review sponsored by the UC Band in which students from all colleges and groups participated. During the 1930s the UC Band gained a national reputation at football games. Mr. Van Pelt and the UC Band were one of the first to use animated formations and dance steps in football halftime shows. The band also traveled extensive ly during these years. World War II: Incorporation of Bandswomen (1942-1949): The rise of World War II put an end to football games after the fall season of 1942. While the band stopped marching, it did not stop playing. Combined concerts with the Conservatory Symphonic Band were held, while the band also played for all formal military functions and War Band Rallies. Throughout the first twenty-three years of its existence, the membership of the band was only men. However Due to the recruitment needs of World War II, only two bandsmen were left on campus from previous years by the fall of 1944. At this time, the UC Band began accepting women for membership on a temporary basis. For the remainder of World War II, membership in the band was predominantly female. Then with the close of World War II in 1945, football games resumed and the UC Band returned to perform on the football field, both men and women. The return of older band members in 1946 though created tension within the UC Band. Many of the returning men felt that the band should revert to its all male status. Their case eventually lost, and the band officially became coed. The 1946-1947 school year was highlighted by a trip to the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, as the UC Football Team made its first appearance in a major bowl game. In the spring of 1947, Mr. Van Pelt submitted his resignation in order to devote full-time to his responsibilities as Supervisor of Instrumental Music in the Cincinnati Public Schools. The search for a new director brought Mr. Clarence E. Mills to the UC Band as its fourth overall director and first full-time director. Mr. Mills had recently been released from the Army where he had served as an Army bandmaster during World War II. He served as director from 1947 to 1949, completely reorganizing and branching the band into a precise, intricate marching Bearcat Band, two pep bands and an intramural band. Varsity Vanities continued, along with a Band Clinic that proved successful for area high school bands. It was during this period that the concert band began its development. In 1949 Mr. Mills left the University of Cincinnati in order to return to the Army as Special Services Officer. The Expansion Years: The Bearcat Bands (1949-1970): Mr. Robert Hamilton served as director of the band from 1949 until the spring of 1954, when he left to take a position in California. Mr. Hamilton introduced the \\"story-telling maneuver\\", adding a new dimension to halftime entertainment. In the spring of 1954, Dr. Roy Robert Hornyak became the sixth director of the UC Band. That fall he introduced the famed CHARGE down the stadium steps, and in 1955 he established the Bearkittens drill team. Due to the increased scope of the activities of the band, 1955 also saw the name of the organization changed to the plural: The University of Cincinnati Bearcat Bands. The UC Band's first Band Camp convened in the fall of 1958. Later that same year, the band was spotlighted on national television as they performed at Chicago's Wrigley Field for a Chicago Bears game. In 1959 the Bearcat Varsity Band joined the Concert Band and the Marching Band as one of the three basic units within the band organization. In 1964, a Stage Band program was initiated and quickly grew under the leadership of Mr. John Defoor, a former arranger for the UC Bands. In 1968 the Brass Band was discontinued and absorbed by the CCM Symphonic Band. The University Band program was incorporated into the College Conservatory of Music around this time as well. Due to increasing demands upon his ti me from other CCM obligations, Dr. Hornyak completed his tenure as director of the UC Bands in the spring of 1970. The Seventies: Searching for Stability (1970-1979): In September 1970, Dr. Robert Wojciak became the seventh director of the UC Bands. The band saw many national appearances through performing at Cincinnati Reds and Bengal games. In 1972, Harry McTerry took over as director of the UC Bands and focused on improving the driving marching and playing style of the UC Marching Band. The UC Band also performed at the 1972 National League Play- offs and World Series. In 1973, Prof. Woodrow Hodges became the ninth director of the UC Bands. During his tenure the band saw much travel with trips to Philadelphia, Disney World, Athens, Georgia, and Louisville. The band was met with great enthusiasm with each trip and received praise for its outstanding performances. The UC Marching Band also performed at the 1975 National League Play-offs and World Series, the 1976 World Series and a Monday Night Football for the Cincinnati Bengals. During Mr. Hodges tenure more emphasis was placed on the basketball Varsity Band. Under the leadership of \\"Woody\\", the UC Band was well known for its high-stepping marching style, original music arrangements, and powerful sound. After four action packed years, Mr. Hodges left to take a position in Wisconsin. The fall of 1977 marked the arrival of the tenth UC Marching Band director, Prof. Glenn Richter, former assistant director of the University of Texas Longhorn Band. Mr. Richter introduced the \\"show band\\" techniques of the southern marching bands, and created the UC Band Flag Corps, incorporating a new color and dimension to the band's performances. After two years with the UC Band, Mr. Richter headed further north to accept a position as director of the University of Michigan marching band. Into the Modern Era: The Return of the CHARGE (1979-1994): Dr. Terence G. Milligan, former director of the Northwest Missouri State University Bands, became the eleventh Director of Bands at UC in 1979. During \\"Doc's\\" time, the band went through a style change to the glide step that is currently used. In the fall of 1981, Dr. Milligan introduced the Rifle Line to complete the UC Color Guard. Dr. Milligan also reintroduced the tradition of charging down the stadium steps during pre-game that had been lost over the years. In the winter of 1986, students in the band organized the \\"Varsity Clown Band\\", which entertained the crowds at basketball games throughout the season. Although popular with the crowd, the Clown Band was disbanded after only two years of performance. In 1987 Mr. Eugene Corporon took the position as Director of Wind Studies at CCM. His new position at UC included responsibility for the Bearcat Bands, and so in the fall of 1988 he instituted \\"Campus Band\\". This new band was designed as a year-round concert band open to all students, faculty, and employees at the University of Cincinnati. Due to changes in the athletic department and the introduction of a new University Dance Team, the Bearkittens were disbanded in the fall of 1989. In 1993, the Bearcat Bands were dropped from CCM funding and for a brief period, the band found itself completely independent of any university sponsorship. Mr. Matthew McInturf, a CCM graduate student, was hired as the interim director of the UC Bands. In the spring of that year, the band was officially transferred from C CM to the Athletic Department. The band also went to an off campus location for band camp, the first time since it was moved on campus by Dr. Milligan. Student members in the band were very excited with the leadership change and off-site band camp, which created a much improved marching band for the 1993 season. A New Era: The Modern Band (1994–Present): In the fall of 1994, the beginning of the marching season brought Dr. Terren Frenz, Sr. to the UC Band as the thirteenth director. Under the baton of Dr. Frenz, several changes helped the UC Band evolve into a much more effective unit. The leadership of the band was transferred from the students of band council, who had been running the band in recent years, to Dr. Frenz. The 1990s were a time of great improvement in the image of the UC Band. New uniforms, provided by the university administration, gave the Band a much-needed face-lift. These new contemporary style uniforms debuted at the Humanitarian Bowl in Boise, Idaho in 1997. This trip marked the first bowl trip for the Bearcats since the Sun Bowl in 1956. However, bowl trips would become almost a regular occurrence at the turn of the century as the football team continued to improve. The year 1999 led to many innovations, including the first appearance of the UC Band at a professional football game in recent history when the Bengals celebrated their last game in Riverfront Stadium. Dr. Frenz would continue this relationship with the Bengals for many years to come. Also in 1999, the band welcomed assistant director Mr. David Martin, who would serve the band for over a decade. The same year, the Bearcat Bands was incorporated as its own independent Department under the Office of Student Life. In the Spring of 2000, the band was finally presented with a new, \\"temporary\\" facility in Armory Fieldhouse. This marked the first real home for the Bearcat Bands in almost 25 years and replaced its previous lodgings in the basement of Laurence Hall. The band would remain there until March 29, 2005 when the Rockwern Band Center was officially dedicated on May 26, 2005. Also in 2005, the university hired an additional assistant band director, Mr. Nick Angelis, bringing the staff to 3 full-time directors. The continued success of the basketball and football teams led to increased exposure for the band all throughout the first decade of the new millennium. Through this exposure and the development of the UC Bands as a whole, membership peaked at over 250 members in 2010. The same year, assistant director David Martin retired after many years of hard work and dedication to the UC Bearcat Bands. His retirement gave way to new assistant band director Dr. Jody Besse graduate from the University of Southern Mississippi. On May 3, 2017. the university announced Mr. Christopher Nichter (assistant director for The Pride of West Virginia as the new band director, replacing Dr. Besse who served as interim director for the last 5 months.

Traditions of the Bearcat Bands The UC Bearcat Band charges down Nippert Stadium's steps. The Bearcat Bands have many traditionshttps://www.ucbearcatbands.com/home/about/traditions/ that are held dear. Although they continually strive for growth, their traditions tie them to the past and provide continuity despite other changes that may occur. 1\\\\. No Cutting Through the Band: Due to the potential for injury to performers or intruders, no one except emergency medical personnel may cut through the band while in formation. If someone attempts to cut through, a band member first asks them politely to go around, and if necessary, briefly explains the tradition. If necessary, appropriate security personnel will be alerted. Likewise, should a band member see another member attempting to prevent an outsider from cutting through, assistance is required. No one may cut through the band. 2\\\\. Good Luck Taps: Before each performance, band members give good luck taps to other members of the band. These consist of two knocks with the knuckles on the other person’s chest over the C-paw. This stems from an old theater tradition. 3\\\\. Pre-game Inspection: Before the warm-up show on Sigma Sigma Commons, band members will form two lines facing each other. Drum Majors then inspect each individual member’s uniform using the proper criteria. 4\\\\. Down the Drive: Before every home football game, the band enters the stadium by marching down Corry Boulevard while playing the band's signature cadence, \\"Down the Drive.\\" The booming cadence establishes the band's arrival to Nippert Stadium. 5\\\\. Charge Down the Stadium Steps: Before the pre-game performance at each home football game, the brass, woodwind and color guard sections line up at the top of Nippert Stadium, play the Army Fanfare, and CHARGE down the stadium steps into formation. 6\\\\. No Music: The UC Band never takes the field for a marching performance with sheet music, and music is expected to be memorized. 7\\\\. Sitting Hat Ripple: After pre-game and halftime performances, the Director and Drum Majors dismiss the band into the stands. No one sits until the Drum Majors give a signal, after which the entire band sits together. The Drum Majors then give another signal for the hat ripple. The person at the appointed end of each row takes off their hat and everyone follows in order. This forms a sort of race between the rows. After the hat ripple, the gloves must be taken off. This keeps our appearance organized and professional. 8\\\\. Post Game: Cheer Cincy/Alma Mater: After every football and basketball game, the band will play Cheer Cincy followed by the Alma Mater. Auxiliary members sing while wind and percussion members play. 9\\\\. Wearing Hats Backwards: If the football team wins the game, the band will turn their hats around during the final playing of Cheer Cincy. The hats are turned around and worn properly for the Alma Mater. 10\\\\. Dismissal: After all relevant rehearsals and performances of the Bearcat Marching Band, the Drum Majors will dismiss the band. This dismissal consists of a vocal and physical cadence modeled after the one originated by George N. Parks. 11\\\\. Confetti Toss: When the basketball team scores its first field goal of the 1st half of the game, the band will throw confetti up into the air. 12\\\\. Sectional Traditions: Most sections within the band have their own traditions, which will be taught to new individuals by the upperclassmen in their sections. 13\\\\. SEE NUMBER 1.

Semaphore is one of the earliest forms of fixed railway signals. These signals display their different indications to train drivers by changing the angle of inclination of a pivoted 'arm'. Semaphore signals were patented in the early 1840s by Joseph James Stevens, and soon became the most widely used form of mechanical signal. Designs have altered over the intervening years, and colour light signals have replaced semaphore signals in most countries, but in a few they remain in use.  Origins  The first railway semaphore signal was erected by Charles Hutton Gregory on the London and Croydon Railway (later the London Brighton and South Coast Railway) at New Cross, southeast London, about 1842 on the newly enlarged layout also accommodating the South Eastern Railway.. John Urpeth Rastrick claimed to have suggested the idea to Hutton Gregory.The National Archives RAIL 386.58. The semaphore was afterwards rapidly adopted as fixed manual signals throughout Britain and the United States superseding all other types in most uses by 1870. Such signals as electrically operated automatic and interlocking signals were widely adopted in the U.S. After 1908 with the advent of the Union Switch & Signals \\"Stye's \\"B\\" & \\"S\\" and the General Railway Signal Company's universal Model 2A mechanisms manual semaphores and earlier electric disc signals quickly began to disappear.  Form  = Components = The British semaphore signal arm consists of two parts: A wooden or metal arm (or \\"blade\\") which pivots at different angles, and a spectacle holding coloured lenses which move in front of a lamp in order to provide indications at night. Usually these were combined into a single frame, though in some types (e.g. \\"somersault\\" signals in which the arm pivoted in the centre), the arm was separate from the spectacle. The arm projects horizontally in its most restrictive aspect; other angles indicate less restrictive aspects. On double lines in Great Britain signal posts are generally placed on the left of the track and always with the semaphore arm(s) facing left with the spectacle and lamp on the right of the post or doll (but on the left of the post or doll for upper quadrant signals). Sighting problems may mean that the post is placed on the right of the other line on double track branches and on single lines, could be placed either side of the track. Note that US semaphore equivalents faced right and as generally on the European continent, on double track branches, up & down lines are opposite to those in the UK. Depending on the arm's position, the appropriately coloured lens is illuminated from behind by either an oil lamp, a gas lamp, or an incandescent lamp run at a low voltage (white LED clusters have also been tested for this purpose). Where a green light was required, a blue lens would usually be used. When combined with the mainly yellow-emitting flame of an oil lamp, this produced a green colour; it was important that the resultant colour was not even yellow-green in appearance, as this could have been confused for a distant signal at 'caution'. Later signals using electric lamps used green lenses. Some signals converted to electric lamps from oil, used a yellow-tinted bulb with the original blue lens to maintain the correct colour or from 1996 on the Western Region of British Railways, a 12volt 5watt bulb was fitted but fed at 10.7volts to produce a brilliance approximating to the colour temperature of an oil wick flame, thus providing a correct red or green aspect during darkness. Most railways in Great Britain employed lower quadrant semaphores, that is to say, the arm dropped from the horizontal, the 'danger' aspect to 'clear' at up to 60° below horizontal and variations in appearance between main and subsidiary lines or sidings existed. On some company's lines, a 3-aspect semaphore prevailed and these showed an intermediate 'Caution' aspect and thus bore a three-lensed spectacle. In 1911, the Metropolitan Line was first to use an upper quadrant semaphore, the idea being brought over from the United states. Following nationalisation in 1948, British Railways standardised on upper quadrant semaphores and all regions gradually adopted that mode, replacing lower quadrant signals gradually except that the Western Region stayed with their well-proven and nicely proportioned lower quadrant semaphores with eventually, a heavy cast iron spectacle bearing circular coloured glasses, replacing the former thinly bordered cast spectacle frame with shaped coloured glasses, the main arms being 4ft long and subsidiaries 3ft with other subsidiaries 2ft long. Previous GWR 5ft arms placed if higher than 26ft above rail level, were changed to 4ft. All replacements were of enamelled steel and bore the appropriate arm colours, red with white band for 'Stop' arm and chevroned yellow arm with black chevron for 'Distant' (Caution) arms. Both types are white on the reverse side with black band or chevron as appropriate. The final 'Call-on', Shunt' or 'Warning' arms on the Western Region were 2ft with red-white-red horizontal stripes and showed a reduced light during darkness with the appropriate black letter, C, S or W, back-lit in the 'proceed' state with a green light shown in that mode. The stop aspect was generally lunar-white during darkness. All are now removed but examples can be seen on UK heritage lines. As at 2020, there are only a few remaining semaphore signals on the Western Region of Network Rail, LED signals having replaced the majority of semaphores. Materials that were commonly used to make signal posts for semaphore signals included timber, lattice steel, tubular steel and concrete. The Southern Railway in Great Britain frequently made use of old rail for signal posts. German semaphore home signals, which are totally different in appearance to the British semaphore signal, include one or two white arms with a red outline and a small circular disk at the end of it, and coloured lenses which display the position of the aspect(s) of the signal during nighttime operation and these arms face right of the post. German semaphore distant signals consist of one yellow disk with a black and white outline and an (optional) thin yellow arrow-shaped disk with a black and white outline. Both the disk and arrow have coloured lenses to aid drivers during nighttime. Those types were to be seen in some other countries which used German signalling principles. = Lower quadrant and upper quadrant = Lower quadrant stop signals at St. Erth in 2007 British Semaphores come in lower quadrant and upper quadrant forms. In a lower quadrant signal, the arm pivots downwards for the less restrictive (known as \\"off\\") indication. Upper quadrant signals, as the name implies, pivot the arm upward for \\"off\\". During the 1870s, all the British railway companies standardised on the use of semaphore signals, which were then invariably all of the lower quadrant type.Vanns, M.A., (1997), An Illustrated History of Signalling, Ian Allan, , p.25 From the 1920s onwards, upper quadrant semaphores almost totally supplanted lower quadrant signals in Great Britain, except on former GWR lines.Vanns, M.A., (1995), Signalling in the Age of Steam, Ian Allan, , p.80 The advantage of the upper quadrant signal is that should the signal wire break, or the signal arm be weighed down by snow (for instance), gravity will tend to cause the signal to drop to the safe \\"danger\\" position. In a lower quadrant signal, the opposite may happen, sending the signal to \\"off\\" when in fact it should be illustrating \\"danger\\". Their spectacle cases, which are on the opposite side of the spindle on which the signal arm is pivoted, are therefore required to be sufficiently heavy to prevent this happening.Kichenside, G.M. & Williams, Alan, (1978), British Railway Signalling, Fourth Edition, Ian Allan, , p.15 Current British practice mandates that semaphore signals, both upper and lower quadrant types, are inclined at an angle of 45 degrees from horizontal to display an \\"off\\" indication.Rail Safety and Standards Board Handbook RS521 Signals, Handsignals, Indicators and Signs, p.26 = Two-position and three- position signals = The first British railway semaphore signals had arms that could be worked to three positions, in the lower quadrant. Used in conjunction with the time-interval system, the arm horizontal meant \\"danger\\", inclined downwards at 45 degrees meant \\"caution\\" and the arm vertical (arm hidden within the post) meant \\"clear\\". The vertical indication gradually came to be discontinued as the absolute block system superseded time-interval working. The Great Northern Railway was the first company to introduce \\"somersault\\" signals, mounted away from the post, after an accident in January 1876 when a train passed a signal giving a false \\"clear\\" aspect because the signal arm had frozen into its slot during a blizzard. Somersault signals at Carrickfergus railway station, showing the distinctive central pivot about which the arm \\"somersaults\\"A later development was the upper quadrant three-position semaphore signal. These worked in the upper quadrant to distinguish them from the then standard two-position lower quadrant semaphores. When the arm is inclined upwards at 45 degrees, the meaning is \\"caution\\" and the arm in the vertical position means \\"clear\\". Thus, three indications can be conveyed with just one arm and without the need for a distant arm on the same post. The early abandonment of the three-position semaphore signal in the UK allowed for the widespread replacement of two-position lower quadrant signals by two- position upper quadrant signals.Vanns, M.A., (1997), An Illustrated History of Signalling, Ian Allan, , p.75 = Colouring and shape of arm = Red was quickly chosen as the best colour for semaphore arms as it was clearly visible against most backgrounds. To enhance the visibility of the arm, a marking of contrasting colour, such as a stripe or spot, is usually applied. The rear of the arm is usually coloured white with a black marking. Where particularly poor background contrast cannot be avoided, a sighting board (usually painted white) can be placed behind the arm to provide adequate contrast which improves visibility. Alternatively, part of a bridge abutment conveniently located behind a signal may be painted white. From 1872, distant signal arms (see below) were distinguished by having a \\"fishtail\\" notch cut into the end. All signal arms were still painted red at this time. In the 1920s, the British railway companies began to colour their distant signal arms yellow to better distinguish them from the red stop signals. The red lenses in distant signals were changed to yellow at the same time. The practice of using red distant arms has survived in some countries however. A third type of arm with a pointed end extending outward is often used (though not in the UK) to indicate that the signal operates automatically (as in automatic block signalling systems) and in many cases indicates that the signal is 'permissive', and can be passed when showing its most restrictive aspect, at a low speed. For most types of semaphore arm, the colour of light shown when the arm is in the \\"on\\" (most restrictive) position generally corresponds to the colour of the arm itself (i.e. red for a stop signal, yellow for a distant signal). When the arm is in the \\"off\\" position, a green light is displayed. Other shapes and colours of semaphore arms were used for specific purposes in different countries around the world.  Operation  Santa Fe Railroad, 1943. The vertical position indicates a \\"clear\\" aspect. Worldwide, the first semaphore signals were controlled by levers situated at the signals. Some early signals protruded from the roof of the controlling signal box. Later, remote operation was effected by levers connected to the signal by single wires (UK), pairs of wires (Continental Europe), or pipes supported on rollers (US). The levers were grouped together in a building known as a \\"signal box\\" (UK & Australia) or \\"interlocking tower\\" (US). In the UK multiple signal wires were grouped together, and in station areas were commonly routed beneath platform faces just above rail level. The operation of a single signal wire would cause some of the adjacent wires to 'jangle', and this noise was one of the many characteristic sounds of railway travel until the gradual introduction of colour-light signals from the mid 20th century. Semaphore signals may also be operated by electric motors, hydraulically or pneumatically, allowing them to be located further from the controlling signal box. In some cases, they can be made to work automatically. The signals are designed to be fail-safe so that if power is lost or a linkage is broken, the arm will move by gravity into the horizontal position. For lower quadrant semaphores this requires the spectacle case to be sufficiently heavy to ensure the arm rises rather than falls; this is one of the reasons for the widespread switch to upper quadrant signals. (The purpose of the balance weight often found on a lever lower down the post of a semaphore signal is actually to ensure the signal wire returns to its normal position when the controlling lever is put back. Otherwise, again, the signal could fail to return to danger. These counterweights are used just as commonly on upper- as on lower-quadrant signals.)  Usage  = Stop signals = British semaphore stop signal (lower quadrant type) A stop signal is any signal whose most restrictive indication is 'danger' (which compels a stop). Stop signals are used to protect junctions, points (US - 'switches'), level crossings, movable bridges, platforms or block sections. A particular signal box may control one or more stop signals on each running line. In a traditional mechanically signalled area, it is most common for a signal box to have two stop signals governing each line. The first reached by a train is known as the home signal. The last stop signal, known as the starting or section signal, is usually located past the points etc. and controls entry to the block section ahead. The distance between the home and starting signals is usually quite short (typically a few hundred yards), and allows a train to wait for the section ahead of it to clear without blocking the line all the way back to the previous section. German home semaphore signals (Haupt Formsignale) can display a danger aspect if the upper arm is in a 90 degree position (horizontal), and can display a proceed aspect if the upper arm is in a 45 degree position (diagonal). Home signals may have an additional lower arm which can display a proceed at reduced speed (40 km/h), however these are not mandatory.  Outer home  At some locations, more than one home signal might be provided on the same line. These will be identified by names such as outer home and inner home, or first home, second home etc. An outer home protects a neutral long of a quarter of a mile (440yards/400m) clear of any points or sidings. This allows trains to approach when the station or junction is obstructed. It is noted that the junction in the Sunshine rail accident did not have outer home signals.  Advanced starting  An advanced starting signal might be used at a location where it might be desirable to advance a train from a station platform before the section ahead becomes available. In this scenario, the starting signal permits the train to draw forward from the station area toward the advanced starting signal, which controls entry to the section ahead. If any of the signals beyond the first stop signal are at 'danger', the previous signals will also be held at 'danger' until the train is almost at a stand, to indicate to the driver that the next signal is at 'danger'. This can be enforced by instruction or by electrical interlocking, which requires the provision of a track circuit on the approach to the signal. In North America, the foregoing terminology was not used, as the development of American signalling practice diverged from that in the United Kingdom during the late nineteenth century. In America, where the term home signal is in common usage, it generally refers to the \\"generic\\" British definition of 'stop signal', namely any signal whose most restrictive indication is 'danger'. = Distant signals = British semaphore distant signal (lower quadrant type) A signal that provides advance warning of a stop signal ahead (and which does not compel a stop when in its most restrictive position) is referred to as distant signal. The term originated in the UK and is used throughout the English-speaking world. In some regions, notably North America, the terms distant signal and approach signal are both in common usage. Because of the long distance required to bring a moving train to a stand, distant signals must be located on the approach to the corresponding stop signal by at least the braking distance of the worst braked train to use the route. This is particularly important on high-speed routes. At one time it was practice to take sighting distance into account when positioning distant signals; the distant signal could therefore be positioned at less than braking distance to the corresponding stop signal. The driver of a train encountering a distant signal at 'caution' must expect the stop signal to be at 'danger' and must adjust the train's speed so as to bring the train to a stand before reaching it. The driver of a train encountering a distant signal in the 'clear' position knows that all applicable stop signals controlled by the same signal box are in the 'clear' position. This is enforced by interlocking; the distant signal is prevented from assuming the 'clear' position unless all relevant stop signals controlled by the signal box display 'clear'. German semaphore distant signals (Vor Formsignale) are able to display an expect proceed aspect if the disk is not visible and the arrow is pointing downwards, and are able to display an expect stop aspect if the disk is visible and the arrow is pointing downwards. Additionally, the optional arrow is used to indicate an expect proceed at a reduced speed if the disk is visible and the arrow is pointing diagonally downwards to the right. Unlike British signals, all German home signals have a respective distant signal and these are both operated from the same lever. A typical signal box layout. The crossover and level crossing are protected by the home signal, while a starting signal guards the entrance to the next block section.  Changes in colour and meaning  In the U.K., until the 1920s, distant signals were coloured red, with a red light at night. Given that their meanings were different, it was obviously unsatisfactory to have both home and distant signals showing the same colour, but one of the problems which delayed a change in the colour of distant signals to yellow was the lack of a suitable yellow glass for the spectacle frame. Some British railway companies used the Coligny-Welch signal lamp to clarify night aspects; this was fitted to distant signals and showed a white vee in addition to the main red or green light. The Ministry of Transport recommended that the colour of distant signal arms and spectacles be altered from red to yellow in the early 1920s, although this was not universally adopted in the UK until the late 1920s. Since this time, the yellow caution aspect has remained a British railway standard. The Victorian Railways in Australia changed only isolated distant signals, leaving combined home and distant signals showing green over red at the caution position. The New South Wales Government Railways retained the red distant signal everywhere, adding a fixed upper green light so that an isolated distant signal displayed green over red, like a combined home and distant signal at caution. In the 19th century, a distant signal on the Victorian Railways required the train to stop when the signal was at red, not just to proceed with caution as is the case now. However, having stopped at a distant signal at red, the train could then proceed carefully to the home signal, being prepared to stop short of any obstruction between the two signals. Thus the distant signal at that time was a bit like a later \\"outer home\\" signal. That practice at a distant signal at that time may have been a factor in the Sunshine rail accident of 1908. = Combined stop and distant signals = British semaphore stop and distant signals on common post (lower quadrant type) Where signals are closely spaced, a stop signal and a distant signal can be mounted on the same post. The distant signal is always the lower of the two. The two signals are \\"slotted\\" so that the distant signal can only clear if the stop signal is clear. Both signals display a light at night, which means that the 'danger' indication appears as red over yellow. Exceptionally in New South Wales home and distant signals controlled from the same signal box would be installed, especially on outer home signals. = Shunting and subsidiary signals = Shunting signals and subsidiary signals also exist in semaphore form, with smaller arms and lights than are provided for main signals. These signals may also take the form of a disc with a horizontal stripe which is rotated 45 degrees to the clear position. = Train order signals = In North America, the earliest semaphores were employed as train order signals,Calvert, J.B. (2004). \\"Train Order Signals.\\" Railways: History, Signalling, Engineering. with the purpose of indicating to engineers whether they should stop to receive either a \\"19 Order\\" or a \\"31 Order\\" telegraphed. Train order signals were typically located at the station building or signal tower, with a tall common post mounting signal arms facing in opposing directions. These were supplemented by Automatic Block Signal semaphores (a U. S. invention), first pneumatically powered in the 1880s and then by the 1890s, automatic electric motor driven semaphores were correctly seen as the future and were continued in manufacture well into the second world war. Although U.S. invented and manufactured 2 arm lower quadrant electro-gas and 3 position upper quadrant electric semaphores were experimented with in the U.K.(such as the ECML, at London Victoria respectively and in isolated areas elsewhere) they never were widely adopted by any means. = Non-railway uses = Signals on the River Weaver Navigation, directing boats into the paired locks Railway-style semaphore signals have been used to control movements of boats or ships (e.g. at swing bridges) and also to control road traffic (e.g. at level crossings).  Decline in usage  Abandoned German semaphore with missing lenses Mechanical signals worldwide are being phased out in favour of colour light signals or, in some cases, signalling systems that do not require lineside signals (e.g. ERTMS). In the United States, mechanical signals have almost gone from main lines. As of 2008, significant remaining installations include the following: * two separate segments of the CSX Transportation line from Louisville, Kentucky to Chicago, Illinois, on the route of the former Monon Railroad; * on the BNSF Railway's Glorieta Subdivision in New Mexico (used by the Southwest Chief). In the UK, semaphore signals are as of 2020 still present on the national network's secondary routes, though increased spending on renewals has led to a faster rate of decline in recent years.scot-rail.co.uk  See also  * Signal passed at danger * Rule 55 * Pass of Brander stone signals * Semaphore line  References  *Section on signals from 'The Signal Box' website Category:Railway signalling ","title":"Railway semaphore signal"},{"id":"14997749","text":"Cyperus acuminatus is a common species of sedge known by several common names, including tapertip flatsedge and pale umbrella-sedge.

She spent her brief career seal hunting in Bass Strait. George was a sloop of 28 tons that John Palmer of Sydney had built on the Hawkesbury River, New South Wales. On 15 May 1803 George ran aground on New Year's Island on her way to Bass Strait. She was eventually refloated on 1 February 1804, although a carpenter drowned in the process.McNab (1907), pp.116-7. In 1806, George, under the command of Thomas Birbeck, was carried onto rocks by a strong current in Twofold Bay in late January or early February. When George was refloated she was found to be so badly damaged that she was immediately beached. Aborigines attacked the crew, throwing spears and burning grass at them. Birbeck and the crew opened fire and killed several aborigines. The crew then set off for Sydney in the ship's boat and arrived there on 13 February 1806. On 20 March 1806 Venus left Sydney to find the wreck and refloat it. However, on arrival it was discovered to be in such bad condition that the cargo of 5000 sealskins were removed and the ship set on fire to salvage the ironwork. Venus returned to Sydney leaving a party of five behind for no apparent reason. One of the men, Yankey Campbell, went missing on 20 April and was presumed to have been killed by aborigines. The remaining four fought a pitched battle with some aborigines and then took to their small boat. Bad weather forced them to land at Jervis Bay where they asked two aborigines to guide them to Sydney. They arrived in Sydney on 13 May 1806.Bateson (1972), p.44.

Professional background Tobias is an American investigative attorney and author. His law practice specializes in technical fraud and related investigations that require the use of special interviewing and interrogation techniques and polygraph testing. Tobias has conducted or reviewed investigations involving locks, safes, security and locking products and technologies for both public and private clients. He also consults with corporations and government agencies with regard to the analysis of locks, alarms and security hardware for bypass capabilities and defective product designs that could lead to breaches in physical security. Tobias has provided expert testimony in patent infringement lawsuits and defective product litigation with regard to product design and security defects, and in criminal trials. He was trained as both a lawyer and criminal investigator and has been a certified polygraph examiner for the past twenty years. He has conducted thousands of polygraph examinations in both criminal and civil investigations involving cases of kidnapping and murder to employee theft from commercial businesses. Security analysis Tobias has analyzed and released numerous security alerts with regard to the security flaws in locks, ranging from high security, state-of-the-art systems that are installed in the White House and the Pentagon to the basic pin-tumbler cylinder locks that are commonly used around the world. He has been responsible for the disclosure of such security defects as the bypass of tubular locks with ball point pens, the insecurity of gun locks that are relied upon to protect children, many popular consumer security devices, lock bumping in the United States, and most recently the security flaws in one of the most recognized high-security locks in the United States. As a lock expert he has demonstrated the vulnerabilities of the security products of many lock companies, including Kwikset, Medeco, Targus, Master Lock and others.

He was an influential member of the American labor movement, helping to co-found the American Federation of Labor. Early life Duncan was born on May 5, 1857,Who's Who in New England, 1915. in Portlethen, Kincardineshire in Scotland. His parents were David and Mary (Forbes) Duncan. His father was a farmer, and David was raised Presbyterian. He attended public elementary school in Aberdeen, then apprenticed as a granite cutter. In 1873, Duncan became a full-fledged granite cutter. His first trade was as a maker of headstones, but he later carved granite statues as well. Duncan married the former Lillian Holman in 1887. The couple had one child.Fink, Biographical Dictionary of American Labor, 1984. Union career In 1880, Duncan emigrated to the United States and settled in New York City. He joined the Granite Cutters' National Union in 1881, and was elected the local's secretary. Duncan moved to Baltimore, Maryland, in 1884, and joined the Granite Cutters' union in that city as well. He was elected the local union's secretary shortly thereafter.At least one source says Duncan moved to Baltimore in 1885. See Fink, Biographical Dictionary of American Labor, 1984. In May 1895, Duncan was elected secretary of the Granite Cutters' National Union. He was also named the editor of the union's journal, the Granite Cutters' Journal. He moved the union's headquarters to Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1900, where he took up residence. The Granite Cutters' National Union had been organized in 1877 as the Granite Cutters' International Union of the United States and the British Provinces of America. The union's founder and first president was Thompson H. Murch, of Maine. He was elected to Congress in 1878, and was replaced by Josiah B. Dyer. Dyer moved the union's headquarters from Maine to Concord, New Hampshire. The union was, at best, a loose federation of largely independent locals. Although it claimed jurisdiction over and had locals in Canada, the Canadian members were an afterthought to the union. In 1880, the union changed its name to the Granite Cutters' National Union and changed its constitution to reduce its jurisdiction to the United States.Najita and Roberts, Roberts' Dictionary Industrial Relations, 1994; Orth, The Armies of Labor, 1919.Whitney, Jurisdiction in American Building-Trades Unions, 1914. During his first few years in office, Duncan proposed and won passage of numerous amendments to the union's constitution, forming the Granite Cutters' National Union into one of the most effective unions in the country.Wood, \\"Tools and Machinery of the Granite Industry, Part IV,\\" Chronicle of the Early American Industries Association, March 2007. He was not, however, a supporter of civil rights for African Americans. Duncan negotiated several contracts in the Deep South which required employers to fire black granite cutters and hire Caucasian ones. When the American Federation of Labor (AFL) later complained about the agreements, Duncan strongly defended them and invoked the AFL's principle of autonomy for member unions in defense. The matter was dropped.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States. Vol. 2: From the Founding of the American Federation of Labor to the Emergence of American Imperialism, 1955. In 1886, Duncan attended the founding convention of the American Federation of Labor as a delegate of the Granite Cutters' union. He was elected second vice-president of the AFL in 1894 and served on its executive council, positions he would hold until his death. Duncan became one of Samuel Gompers' closest friends and confidantes. A political independent, Duncan successfully pushed Gompers to avoid making political endorsements and support for a single political party.Taft, The A.F. of L. in the Time of Gompers, 1957. In 1900, Duncan led the granite cutters out on a nationwide strike.This is not quite as important as it sounds, for granite cutters were primarily located in New England and a few other northern states. The strike began on March 1, 1900, and was settled on May 16, 1900, after the intervention of former Senator William Andrews Clark (whose home needed granite for its construction). The strike was successful, and the subsequent collective bargaining agreement made the Granite Cutters' National Union the first American labor union to win the eight-hour day for every single local.Cahill, Shorter Hours: A Study of the Movement Since the Civil War, 1932; Markowitz, \\"Hazardous History: Researching the Dangerous Trades,\\" Reviews in American History, June 1998; \\"Granite Cutters to Strike,\\" New York Times, February 28, 1900; \\"Granite Cutters' Strike Settled,\\" New York Times, April 29, 1900; \\"Granite Cutters' Strike Ends,\\" New York Times, May 17, 1900. Duncan's success in securing the eight-hour day for his members led him to be elected first vice-president of the AFL later that year.\\"James Duncan Dies,\\" New York Times, September 15, 1928. In 1903, Duncan proposed expanding the union's jurisdiction across North America. His proposal was not approved by the union's national convention, but he won passage of the jurisdictional expansion in 1905. Afterward, the union was known as the Granite Cutters' International Association. In 1905, Duncan established the first old-age pension plan for union workers in the United States.Munnell, The Economics of Private Pensions, 1982; Kotlikoff and Smith, Pensions in the American Economy, 1984. Duncan served in a number of capacities for the federal government as well. In 1913, President Woodrow Wilson appointed him to a national commission to study workers' compensation insurance. In June 1917, Wilson appointed Duncan Envoy Extraordinary to Russia.\\"Glennon's Words End Fleet Mutiny at Sebastopol,\\" New York Times, June 25, 1917; \\"Root Has Faith Russia Will Stand,\\" New York Times, August 5, 1917. In 1918, Wilson chose Duncan to be one of the American trade union delegates to the Paris Peace Conference. He served as a member of the commission which established the International Labour Organization.\\"Choose U.S. Labor Delegates to Paris,\\" New York Times, December 29, 1918; Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States.

In 1924, Samuel Gompers named Duncan one of the AFL delegates to the Pan-American Federation of Labor in Mexico City. The ailing 74-year-old Gompers collapsed on December 6, and doctors said he did not have long to live. Gompers, Duncan and the AFL delegation rushed back to the United States. When the train reached San Antonio, Texas, on December 12, Gompers was taken to a private home. As he lay dying, Duncan held his hand. Gompers died at 4:10 a.m. on December 13, and Duncan was highly distraught for several hours after his death.\\"End Comes On Home Soil,\\" Associated Press, December 14, 1924. James Duncan was nominated for president of the American Federation of Labor after Gompers' death. But Matthew Woll, not Duncan, was the first choice of the \\"Gompers faction\\" on the council. The anti-Gompers faction, led by John L. Lewis, was adamantly opposed to Woll's election. Woll promoted Duncan as the candidate of the status quo, but he was easily defeated by William Green, a member of the United Mine Workers and a man generally considered subservient to Woll and Lewis.Phelan, William Green: Biography of a Labor Leader, 1989; Goulden, Meany, 1972; Robinson, George Meany and His Times, 1981.

Early life and education Frankfort was born to Salomon Simon Frankfort and Dine Bendien-Frankfort. He was the youngest of eight children. His father was a devoutly religious merchant, and Eduard's upbringing reflected his father's strict religious beliefs. When he was eleven years old, his family moved to Amsterdam, where Salomon Simon Frankfort hoped Eduard would eventually take a municipal job. My Father's Morning Prayer Eduard, however, showed an early interest in painting. From ages eleven to seventeen, he underwent formal training at Atelier Bing to become a visual artist. In 1887, he studied under master painter August Allebé at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten (the Royal Academy for Visual Arts) in Amsterdam. Afterwards, he studied painting for several months at the Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen (the Antwerp Royal Academy of Fine Arts) in Antwerp, Belgium. Career Eduard Frankfort remained in Amsterdam until 1905. Many of his paintings featured Jewish religious themes. Like other contemporary artists, Frankfort was drawn to Laren. In 1903, he was awarded a gold medal by the Royal Art Society \\"Arti et Amicitiae\\". He was highly regarded at that time and was asked to teach at several schools. In 1905, he followed his sister to South Africa, where he toured and painted portraits. One such portrait he did during this time was of Esther de Boer-van Rijk.

Launched in 2000 as the Patent Lens, the site allowed free searching of over 10 million full-text patent documents, including United States patents and applications, Australian patents and applications, European patents and Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications. The Patent Lens was distinguished as being the only not-for-profit facility of its kind, with international coverage and links to non-patent literature and tutorials. In 2013 the Patent Lens was officially replaced with Cambia's new site The Lens. The Lens made improvements in the visual presentation of patent analysis and workspace management. It also features a biological facility with a number of tools for searching and analysing sequences found in patents. Features Searches of the Lens can be undertaken using numerous variables, including full-text, title, abstract, inventor, applicant/assignee, publication number and filing number. A user is also able to search for lapsed, abandoned, or expired US patents via the INPADOC patent status and family information service. Patent families may be visualized using graphical trees as PDF files. The Lens currently links to regulatory data in the form of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations. Biological sequence data is integrated via links to National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank and the Patent Lens's own gene sequences. The Patent Lens Sequence Project, commenced in June 2006, provides the only public facility to enable users to explore over 80 million DNA and protein sequences disclosed in patents. Patent tutorials are available on the site covering patent claims, freedom to operate, patent inventorship, and continuing patent applications. Plant breeders' rights (PBR), also known as plant variety rights (PVR), are also addressed. This has the intention to \\"forge a learning resource that participants in innovation systems at all levels... can use to learn of critical and timely issues relevant to improving the public good... by engaging with the patent system\\". Native language support The patent search interface is available in Chinese, English and French, with the full text of European Patent Office (EPO) patents being searchable in English, French and German. PCT applications are searchable in Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Russian and Spanish. Technology landscapes In addition to the patent search engine, the Lens also hosts a number of \\"technology landscapes\\". These landscapes analyse volumes of specialized patent, scientific, technical and business data around particular topics into a more navigable form. In the field of health and medicine, landscapes have been created for human genome patenting, the influenza genome, the human Telomerase gene, molecular markers outside gene sequences, and adjuvants. For agriculture and the environment, landscapes exist to describe the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of plants, promoters used to regulate gene expression, antibiotic resistance genes and their uses in plant genetic transformation, resistance to Phosphinothricin, positive selection, bioindicators/ambiosensors, and the rice genome. From 2000–2004, the Rockefeller Foundation backed development of the initial technology landscapes. In 2005, the Patent Lens made the landscapes fully navigable, interactive, and updatable by users. Endorsement The landscaping activities of the Patent Lens have been endorsed by Dr. Francis Gurry, director general of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in March, 2009, in \\"view of the shared objective of making patent information systems more comprehensive and accessible, and turning raw patent data into useful information resources so as to strengthen the empirical basis of international policy processes\\".

It is a subsidiary of the Air France–KLM Group and a founding member of the SkyTeam global airline alliance. As of 2013 Air France serves 36 destinations in France and operates worldwide scheduled passenger and cargo services to 175 destinations in 78 countries (93 including overseas departments and territories of France) and also carried 46,803,000 passengers in 2019. The airline's global hub is at Charles de Gaulle Airport with Orly Airport as the primary domestic hub. Air France's corporate headquarters, previously in Montparnasse, Paris, are located on the grounds of Charles de Gaulle Airport, north of Paris. Air France was formed on 7 October 1933 from a merger of Air Orient, Air Union, Compagnie Générale Aéropostale, Compagnie Internationale de Navigation Aérienne (CIDNA), and Société Générale de Transport Aérien (SGTA). During the Cold War, from 1950 until 1990, it was one of the three main Allied scheduled airlines operating in Germany at West Berlin's Tempelhof and Tegel airports. In 1990, it acquired the operations of French domestic carrier Air Inter and international rival UTA – Union de Transports Aériens. It served as France's primary national flag carrier for seven decades prior to its 2003 merger with KLM. In 2018, Air France and its regional subsidiary Hop carried 51.4 million passengers. Air France operates a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing widebody jets on long-haul routes, and uses Airbus A320 family aircraft on short-haul routes. Air France introduced the A380 on 20 November 2009 with service to New York City's JFK Airport from Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport. Air France Hop (formerly HOP!) operates the majority of its regional domestic and European scheduled services with a fleet of regional jet aircraft.  History  = Formation and early years = The inauguration of the Aérogare des Invalides on 21 August 1951 Air France was formed on 7 October 1933, from a merger of Air Orient, Air Union, Compagnie Générale Aéropostale, Compagnie Internationale de Navigation Aérienne (CIDNA) and Société Générale des Transports Aériens (SGTA). Of these airlines, SGTA was the first commercial airline company in France, having been founded as Lignes Aériennes Farman in 1919. The constituent members of Air France had already built extensive networks across Europe, to French colonies in North Africa and farther afield. During World War II, Air France moved its operations to Casablanca (Morocco). In 1936, Air France added French-built twin engine Potez 62 aircraft to its fleet featuring a two compartment cabin that could accommodate 14 to 16 passengers. A high wing monoplane, it had a wooden fuselage with composite coating while the wings were fabric covered with a metal leading edge. Equipped with Hispano-Suiza V-engines, they were used on routes in Europe, South America and the Far East. Although cruising at only 175 miles per hour, the Potez 62 was a robust and reliable workhorse for Air France and remained in service until the Second World War with one used by the Free French Air Force.\\"For Air France: The Potez 62: Cruising Speed of 175 mph with Fourteen Passengers\\". Flight, 21 March 1935, p. 304. 1936 Air France ad for service using Potez 62 twin-engine aircraft An Air France Douglas DC-3 at Manchester Airport in 1952 On 26 June 1945 all of France's air transport companies were nationalised. On 29 December 1945, a decree of the French Government granted Air France the management of the entire French air transport network. Air France appointed its first flight attendants in 1946. The same year the airline opened its first air terminal at Les Invalides in central Paris. It was linked to Paris Le Bourget Airport, Air France's first operations and engineering base, by coach. At that time the network covered 160,000 km, claimed to be the longest in the world. Société Nationale Air France was set up on 1 January 1946. European schedules were initially operated by a fleet of Douglas DC-3 aircraft. On 1 July 1946, Air France started direct flights between Paris and New York via refuelling stops at Shannon and Gander. Douglas DC-4 piston-engine airliners covered the route in just under 20 hours. In September 1947 Air France's network stretched east from New York, Fort de France and Buenos Aires to Shanghai. Lockheed Super Constellation of Air France at Heathrow Airport in April 1955 By 1948 Air France operated 130 aircraft, one of the largest fleets in the world. Between 1947 and 1965 the airline operated Lockheed Constellations on passenger and cargo services worldwide.Marson, Peter, \\"The Lockheed Constellation Series\\", Air-Britain (Historians) Ltd, 1982, , pp. 137–141 In 1946 and 1948, respectively, the French government authorised the creation of two private airlines: Transports Aériens Internationaux – later Transports Aériens Intercontinentaux – (TAI) and SATI. In 1949 the latter became part of Union Aéromaritime de Transport (UAT), a private French international airline.Aeroplane – Airline of the Month: UTA – Five-star independent, Vol. 109, No. 2798, p. 4, Temple Press, London, 3 June 1965 Compagnie Nationale Air France was created by act of parliament on 16 June 1948. Initially, the government held 70%. In subsequent years the French state's direct and indirect shareholdings reached almost 100%. In mid-2002 the state held 54%. On 4 August 1948 Max Hymans was appointed the president. During his 13-year tenure he would implement modernisation practices centred on the introduction of jet aircraft. In 1949 the company became a co-founder of Société Internationale de Télécommunications Aéronautiques (SITA), an airline telecommunications services company. = Jet age reorganisation = Passengers disembarking an Air France Sud-Est SE-161 In 1952 Air France moved its operations and engineering base to the new Orly Airport South terminal. By then the network covered 250,000 km. Air France entered the jet age in 1953 with the original, short-lived de Havilland Comet series 1, the world's first jetliner. During the mid-1950s it also operated the Vickers Viscount turboprop, with twelve entering services between May 1953 and August 1954 on the European routes. On 26 September 1953, the government instructed Air France to share long-distance routes with new private airlines. This was followed by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport's imposition of an accord on Air France, Aigle Azur, TAI and UAT, under which some routes to Africa, Asia and the Pacific region were transferred to private carriers. On 23 February 1960, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport transferred Air France's domestic monopoly to Air Inter. To compensate for the loss of its domestic network Air France was given a stake in Air Inter. The following day Air France was instructed to share African routes with Air Afrique and UAT. The airline started uninterrupted jet operations in 1960 with the Sud Aviation Caravelle and the Boeing 707; jet airliners cut travel times in half and improved comfort. Air France later became an early Boeing 747 operator and eventually had one of the world's largest 747 fleets. One of Air France's Caravelle jetliners in 1977 On 1 February 1963 the government formalised division of routes between Air France and its private sector rivals. Air France was to withdraw services to West Africa (except Senegal), Central Africa (except Burundi and Rwanda), Southern Africa (including South Africa), Libya in North Africa, Bahrain and Oman in the Middle East, Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) in South Asia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore in Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand as well as New Caledonia and Tahiti. These routes were allocated to the new Union de Transports Aériens (UTA), a new private airline resulting from the merger of TAI and UAT. UTA also got exclusive rights between Japan, New Caledonia and New Zealand, South Africa and Réunion island in the Indian Ocean, as well as Los Angeles and Tahiti.Aeroplane – Airline of the Month: UTA – Five-star independent, Vol. 109, No. 2798, pp. 4–6, Temple Press, London, 3 June 1965 From 1974, Air France began shifting the bulk of operations to the new Charles de Gaulle Airport north of Paris. By the early 1980s, only Corsica, Martinique, Guadeloupe, most services to French Guiana, Réunion, the Maghreb region, Eastern Europe (except the USSR), Southern Europe (except Greece and Italy), and one daily service to New York (JFK) remained at Orly. In 1974, Air France also became the world's first operator of the Airbus A300 twin-engine widebody plane, Airbus Industrie's first commercial airliner for which it was a launch customer. = Concorde service and rivalry = An Air France Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Airport in 2003 On 21 January 1976, Air France operated its inaugural supersonic transport (SST) service on the Paris (Charles de Gaulle) to Rio (via Dakar) route with Anglo-French BAC-Aérospatiale Concorde F-BVFA. Supersonic services from Paris (CDG) to Washington Dulles International Airport began on 24 May 1976, also with F-BVFA. Service to New York (JFK) – the only remaining Concorde service until its end – commenced on 22 November 1977. Paris to New York was flown in 3 hours 23 minutes, at about twice the speed of sound. Approval for flights to the United States was initially withheld due to noise protests. Eventually, services to Mexico City via Washington, D.C. were started. Air France became one of only two airlines – British Airways being the other – to regularly operate supersonic services, and continued daily transatlantic Concorde service until late May 2003. By 1983, Air France's golden jubilee, the workforce numbered more than 34,000, its fleet about 100 jet aircraft (including 33 Boeing 747s) and its 634,400 km network served 150 destinations in 73 countries. This made Air France the fourth-largest scheduled passenger airline in the world, as well as the second-largest scheduled freight carrier. Air France also codeshared with regional French airlines, TAT being the most prominent. TAT would later operate several regional international routes on behalf of Air France. In 1983 Air France began passenger flights to South Korea, being the first European airline to do so.Rahn, Kim. \\"Air France Celebrates 25th Years in Korea.\\" The Korea Times. 25 September 2008. Retrieved on 29 June 2010. In 1986 the government relaxed its policy of dividing traffic rights for scheduled services between Air France, Air Inter and UTA, without route overlaps between them. The decision opened some of Air France's most lucrative routes on which it had enjoyed a government-sanctioned monopoly since 1963 and which were within its exclusive sphere of influence, to rival airlines, notably UTA. The changes enabled UTA to launch scheduled services to new destinations within Air France's sphere, in competition with that airline. Air France operated 33 Boeing 747s by 1983. Here, a 747-100 is seen at Paris (CDG) in 1978 Paris-San Francisco became the first route UTA served in competition with Air France non-stop from Paris. Air France responded by extending some non-stop Paris-Los Angeles services to Papeete, Tahiti, which competed with UTA on Los Angeles- Papeete. UTA's ability to secure traffic rights outside its traditional sphere in competition with Air France was the result of a campaign to lobby the government to enable it to grow faster, becoming more dynamic and more profitable. This infuriated Air France. In 1987 Air France together with Lufthansa, Iberia and SAS founded Amadeus, an IT company (also known as a GDS) that would enable travel agencies to sell the founders and other airlines' products from a single system. In 1988, Air France was a launch customer for the fly-by-wire (FBW) A320 narrowbody twin, along with Air Inter and British Caledonian. It became the first airline to take delivery of the A320 in March 1988, and along with Air Inter became the first airlines to introduce Airbus A320 service on short-haul routes. = Acquisitions and privatisation = A Dassault Mercure of Air Inter, which became part of Air France in 1990. On 12 January 1990, the operations of government-owned Air France, semi-public Air Inter and wholly private Union de Transports Aériens (UTA) were merged into an enlarged Air France. Air France's acquisition of UTA and Air Inter was part of an early 1990s government plan to create a unified, national air carrier with the economies of scale and global reach to counter potential threats from the liberalisation of the EU's internal air transport market. On 25 July 1994, a new holding company, Groupe Air France, was set up by decree. Groupe Air France became operational on 1 September 1994. It acquired the Air France group's majority shareholdings in Air France and Air Inter (subsequently renamed Air Inter Europe). On 31 August 1994, Stephen Wolf, a former United Airlines CEO, was appointed adviser to the Air France group's chairman Christian Blanc. Wolf was credited with the introduction of Air France's hub and spoke operation at Paris Charles de Gaulle. (Wolf resigned in 1996 to take over as CEO at US Airways.)Statement from Air France Group Chairman regarding Stephen M. Wolf. Business Wire, 16 January 1996 In 1997, Air France Europe was absorbed into Air France. On 19 February 1999, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's Plural Left government approved Air France's partial privatisation. Its shares were listed on the Paris stock exchange on 22 February 1999. In June 1999, Air France and Delta Air Lines formed a bilateral transatlantic partnership. On 22 June 2000, this expanded into the SkyTeam global airline alliance. = Air France–KLM merger = The merger of Air France and KLM occurred in 2004 On 30 September 2003, Air France and Netherlands-based KLM Royal Dutch Airlines announced the merger of the two airlines, the new company to be known as Air France–KLM. The merger became reality on 5 May 2004. At that point former Air France shareholders owned 81% of the new firm (44% owned by the French state, 37% by private shareholders), former KLM shareholders the rest. The decision of the Jean-Pierre Raffarin government to reduce the French state's shareholding in the former Air France group from 54.4% to 44% of the newly created Air France–KLM Group effectively privatised the new airline. In December 2004 the state sold 18.4% of its equity in Air France–KLM. The state's shareholding in Air France–KLM subsequently fell to just under 20%. Air France–KLM became the largest airline in the world in terms of operating revenues, and third-largest (largest in Europe) in passenger kilometres. Although owned by a single company, Air France and KLM continued to fly under their own brand names. Air France–KLM remained part of the SkyTeam alliance, which then included Aeroflot, Delta Air Lines, Aeroméxico, Korean Air, Czech Airlines, Alitalia, Northwest Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Air Europa, Continental Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, Vietnam Airlines and Saudi Arabian Airlines. As of March 2004, The group employed 71,654 people. As of March 2007, the group employed 102,422 personnel. = Open Skies venture = On 17 October 2007, the creation of a profit and revenue-sharing transatlantic joint venture between Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines was announced during a press conference at Air France- KLM's headquarters. The venture became effective on 29 March 2008. It aimed to exploit transatlantic opportunities to capture a major share of long-haul business traffic from London Heathrow Airport, which opened to unrestricted competition on that day as a result of the \\"Open Skies\\" pact between the EU and US. It was envisaged that Air France and Delta would begin nine daily round trips between London-Heathrow and destinations in the US, including a daily London (Heathrow) to Los Angeles service by Air France. Once the new Air France-Delta venture received antitrust immunity, it was to be extended to the other two transatlantic SkyTeam partners, enabling all four partners to codeshare flights as well as to share revenue and profit. The new transatlantic joint venture marks the Air France-KLM Group's second major expansion in the London market, following the launch of CityJet-operated short-haul services from London City Airport that have been aimed at business travellers in the City's financial services industry. However, the daily London (Heathrow) to Los Angeles service was not as successful as hoped, and was discontinued in November 2008. = 2010s = On 12 January 2012, Air France-KLM announced a three-year transformation plan, called Transform 2015, to restore profitability. The plan was to restore competitiveness through cost-cutting, restructuring the short- and medium-haul operations and rapidly reducing debt. The main objective of this plan was to turn Air France-KLM back into a world player by 2015. Air France had been losing 700 million euros a year. As the financial results of 2011 demonstrated, the long-haul operations, also subject to increasing competition, would not be able to offset these losses. On 22 February 2012, Air France released its plan for the summer schedule. Because of the uncertain economic environment, Air France-KLM set a limit of 1.4% maximum increase in capacity from 25 March 2012 – 28 October 2012. On 21 June 2012, Air France-KLM had announced its decision to cut just under 10% of the total 53,000 workforce (about 5,000 jobs) by the end of 2013 in an attempt to restore profitability. The airline expected to lose 1,700 jobs through natural turnover and the rest by voluntary redundancies. As of August 2012, the Transform 2015 plan was accepted by ground staff and pilot unions but rejected by cabin crew unions. An Air France 777-200ER taking off from Vancouver International Airport At the beginning of July 2012, it was announced that Air France-KLM found partners for the new African start-up airline Air france, which was co-founded by six countries in Central Africa to replace the former Air Afrique. But several problems and two partners, who decided to back out, delayed the implementation of the project. Following its launch, Air france announced it would commence operations in 2013. In September 2013, Air France introduced a brand new Economy product along with an improved Premium Economy seat and service. It is expected that the new improvements would be fitted on aircraft from June 2014 onwards. In October 2013, Air France-KLM announced it was writing off the 25% stake in Alitalia, as it was hesitant the struggling carrier would obtain the 300 million euros in financing. The group has denied Alitalia of additional funds as it is currently struggling to restructure itself to profitability with the Transform 2015 plan. In December 2013, Air France announced that Cityjet no longer meets the short haul needs of the group and is in the process of closing a deal with German firm Intro Aviation by the end of Q1 of 2014. In 2014, the airline was targeted by a negative publicity campaign, spearheaded by PETA, for being the only major airline that permits the transport of primates for research. On 4 February 2014, the new business product was unveiled, featuring a fully flat bed from Zodiac Aerospace. The seat was fitted on Boeing 777 aircraft from June 2014 onwards. In September 2014, Air France announced it would sell a 3 percent stake in travel technology company Amadeus IT Group for $438 million. Late in 2015, Air France faced a financial crisis, which was exacerbated by a pilot's strike against the airline. The airline answered the strike by announcing it would cut some 2,900 jobs. In December 2015, Air France announced the retirement of its last Boeing 747-400 with a special scenic flight on 14 January 2016. The airline operated the 747 in several variants since 1970.aero.de – \\"Air France bids farewell to the Jumbo\\" (German) 8 December 2015 In January 2017, Air France received its first Boeing 787–9. In November, CityJet no longer operated on Air France flights and the affected destinations were served by Air France and HOP! from then on. In July 2017, Air France-KLM entered into a multi-airline strategic partnership with Delta Air Lines, China Eastern Airlines and Virgin Atlantic, solidifying the existing ties between the carriers. Under the agreement Delta and China Eastern would each buy 10% of Air France-KLM, while Air France-KLM would buy 31% of Virgin Atlantic.cnn.com online article dated 28 July 2017;\\"Four huge airlines on three continents are creating a virtual super- airline;\\"https://money.cnn.com/2017/07/27/news/companies/delta-airfrance- virgin-china-tie-up/index.html In December 2019, the purchase of Virgin Atlantic was cancelled.Branson Drops Air France Deal to Keep Control of Virgin Atlantic Bloomberg 2 December 2019 Air France announced it would terminate services to Iran from September 2018, explaining the concern that the route to Iran is no longer commercially viable due to the redefined US sanctions.

In 1993, its subsidiary, Air Charter, began operating flights between Paris and Taipei via Hong Kong,French plans for Taipei, South China Morning Post, 8 September 1993 but after Air Charter ceased operations in 1998, a subsidiary called Air France Asie was established.FRANCE'S TAIWAN POLICY: A CASE OF SHOPKEEPER DIPLOMACY, Jean Pierre Cabestan, 2001 The airline was one of a number of airline subsidiaries flying under the \\"Asia\\" name with the purpose of flying to Taiwan, which included Japan Asia Airways (a Japan Airlines subsidiary), KLM Asia, British Asia Airways, Swissair Asia, and Australia Asia Airlines (a Qantas subsidiary). The livery of Air France Asie differed from that of Air France by having blue and white stripes on the tailfin, rather than blue, white and red ones, representing the French Tricolour. Air France Asie used two Airbus A340-200 aircraft, F-GLZD and F-GLZE, and two Boeing 747-428Ms, F-GISA and F-GISC. Similarly, Air France Cargo Asie used a 747-200 Combi (for passengers and freight), F-GCBH) or the all-cargo (F-GCBL, F-GPAN and F-GBOX). Air France Asie ceased operations in 2004 while Air France Cargo Asie ceased operations in 2007. = Outsourcing = In 2010 Air France migrated from an internally managed Passenger service system (Alpha3) that manages reservation, inventory and pricing to an external system (Altéa) managed by Amadeus.

Routes have become available to operators in accordance with European rail liberalisation on 1 January 2010.Air France, Veolia plan high-speed rail venture Reuters, 8 September 2008 = Livery = Air France's present livery is a \\"Eurowhite\\" scheme, comprising a white fuselage with the blue Air France title and design. The tail is white with a series of parallel red and blue lines across the tail at an angle, and a small European flag at the top. This livery has been in use since the late 1970s. Prior to the \\"Eurowhite\\" livery, Air France aircraft had a bare-metal underside, extending up to a blue cheat-line that ran across the cabin windows. Above the cheat-line the fuselage was again white, with Air France titles and a French flag. The tail was white with two thick blue lines, which tapered from the rear of the tail and met at point towards the front bottom. This basic livery, with minor variations, would appear on all post-war Air France aircraft until the late 1970s. On January 2009, to coincide with Air France's new logo, a new livery was unveiled. Air France rolled out its new livery on 11 February 2009. The 2009 livery saw the tail slightly changed; there are now 3 blue bars running down instead of 4 previously. The bars also now curve at the bottom, reflecting the design of the logo. In 2017, Air France received their first Boeing 787 with a revised livery which included a larger Air France titles. In 2019, Air France revised the livery with the arrival of the Airbus A350, with blue winglets featuring the hippocampe ailé. At the same time, Air France returned the tradition of naming each of their aircraft, with the name written under the front cabin windows.

Air France has used different popular music groups for its marketing and on-board ambience, ranging from The Chemical Brothers in 1999 to Telepopmusik in 2010. Air France launched a new ad campaign in 2015 designed by BETC and directed by We Are From LA, focusing on French culture. Along with the ad campaign and print ads, Air France also introduced a similarly themed safety video. The music is a customised version of Glass Candy's song Warm in the Winter. = Uniforms = Air France uniforms denote the ranks for the flight attendants. Two silver sleeve stripes denote a Chief Purser. One silver sleeve stripe denote a Purser. Flight attendants do not have any sleeve stripes. The female cabin crew uniforms feature the stripes on the breast pocket rather than the sleeve for their male counterparts. Air France's current uniforms were created by French fashion designer Christian Lacroix. = Branding = Upon its formation, Air France adopted the seahorse logo of its predecessor Air Orient, known as the hippocampe ailé (sometimes derisively called \\"la crevette\\" – or shrimp – by its employees), as its insignia. Prior to the Air France-KLM merger, the hippocampe ailé was used on the nose section of aircraft next to the Groupe Air France title; after the merger, the Air France-KLM logo was substituted at the nose area, and the hippocampe ailé was relocated to engine nacelles. The acronym \\"AF\\" has also featured prominently on the airline's flag and its signage. On 7 January 2009, Air France officially changed its logo to a red stripe.

Air France-KLM has a commitment for 37 Boeing 787s, 25 directly and 12 leased, of which 16 are earmarked for Air France to replace some A340-300s, subsequent A340s would be replaced by Airbus A350s from 2019. The first Boeing 787-9 entered into service with KLM in 2015 and with Air France in early 2017. Air France-KLM has 28 A350s on firm order. In June 2019 the group announced a revision of the original order with Air France becoming the sole operator of the Airbus A350, with KLM only operating Boeing 787s, including six originally earmarked for Air France. The first Airbus A350-900 (named Toulouse) was delivered to Air France on 27 September 2019. = Narrowbody fleet = Air France operates a fleet of all four variants of the Airbus A320 ceo family aircraft with a total of 114 jets. In July 2019 a first order was announced as part of replacing its narrowbody fleet. The smaller Airbus A318 and A319 fleet will be replaced by 60 Airbus A220-300s starting in 2021. Air France would have to cut emission by half by 2024 for flights within mainland France as part of conditions of a €7 billion state support from France. As a result, Air France plans to place more Airbus A220 onto its domestic network. = Concorde = The aerial view of an Air France Concorde (registration: F-BVFA) at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia The five Air France Concordes were retired on 31 May 2003, as a result of insufficient demand following the 25 July 2000 crash of AF Concorde F-BTSC, at Gonesse (near Charles de Gaulle Airport), as well as higher fuel and maintenance costs. British Airways flew its last Concorde service on 24 October 2003. Concorde F-BVFA was transferred to the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles International Airport. F-BVFB was given to the Sinsheim Auto & Technik Museum in Germany, F-BTSD to the Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace at Le Bourget Airport in Paris, while F-BVFC returned to its place of manufacture in Toulouse, at the Airbus factory. F-BVFF is the only example to remain at Charles de Gaulle Airport.  Boeing 747  A retired Air France Boeing 747-400 The airline started operating the 747 on 3 June 1970, when a 747-100 was put into service that was delivered 20 March that year.\\"Orders and Deliveries: Boeing 747.\\" The Boeing Company. Retrieved: 1 March 2018. It would go on to operate the -200, -300 and -400 variants. In January 2016, Air France finally retired its last Boeing 747–400. They were replaced by Airbus A380s and Boeing 777-300ERs. Freighter versions were replaced by Boeing 777Fs.  Airbus A380  Air France signed as a launch customer for the Airbus A380-800 \\"superjumbo\\" in 2001. Air France had ordered 12 Airbus A380-800 aircraft, with options on a further two. Air France was the first airline in Europe to operate the A380. The first A380 was delivered on 30 October 2009, and the Paris to New York route was used as the first route. All of Air France's Airbus A380s depart from the airline's international hub at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Terminal 2E (Main Terminal, Satellites 3 and 4). In 2018, the Chairman and CEO of Air France-KLM, Benjamin Smith announced the airline would retire 50% of the Airbus A380 fleet by 2021 due to expensive costs, poor efficiency, and in favor of adding more Airbus A350-900s and Boeing 787 Dreamliners to the fleet. Air France is only retiring the five aircraft that were leased to the airline by not renewing their leases and instead of returning them directly to Airbus. The five Airbus A380 aircraft bought by Air France will continue service from 2020 onwards with renewed cabins. On 23 June 2019, Air France-KLM began considering removing all of their Airbus A380s earlier than planned due to concerns that investments for cabin retrofitting and economics would not work. This means that if Air France-KLM makes the decision to remove all their Airbus A380s earlier than planned, the non-leased Airbus A380s will never be seen with retrofitted and modernized cabins. In August 2019, Air France-KLM revised retirement plans on the Airbus A380 and announced that the entire Airbus A380 fleet would be retired by 2022. This will lead to Air France-KLM eliminating all quad-jet planes from their fleet by 2022 with the exception of the three KLM Cargo Boeing 747-400ERFs operated by Martinair. Instead Air France-KLM will evaluate the Airbus A330neo aircraft and/or additional Airbus A350s and Boeing 787s as replacement aircraft to replace the A380 fleet instead their original plan of refurbishing 50% of the Airbus A380 fleet with modernized cabins. Air France- KLM announced an additional order in December 2019 for 10 more Airbus A350-900s, intended for Air France, to replace the nine remaining Airbus A380s and increase the Airbus A350 fleet size from 28 to 38 aircraft. This should help make up capacity that will be left behind once the Airbus A380 is retired but will be more efficient than the Airbus A380. On 2 January 2020, Air France retired its first A380. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Air France-KLM retired its nine remaining A380s by May of 2020 instead of 2022.Air France Retiring All Airbus A380s Immediately Forbes 20 May 2020On 26 June 2020 operates the farewell flight with a tour over France on the A380.

The sixth tropical storm of the season, Elena developed from a tropical wave to the south of Louisiana on August 29. It tracked generally west-northwest, strengthening little before making landfall on Matagorda Island on September 1 as a minimal tropical storm; the storm quickly dissipated over land. Elena dropped moderate rainfall along its path, causing two direct deaths in Houston from drowning; storm damage was minor, amounting to less than $10 million (1979 USD, $28 million 2007 USD). Lightning from the storm set fire to an oil supertanker in Houston, causing three indirect deaths and 13 injuries. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 17. It tracked westward, passing through the Lesser Antilles on August 22, and on August 27 the weak wave axis crossed through Florida. A tropical disturbance organized along the wave axis, with ship and buoy reports indicating the development of a low-level circulation by August 29. At 2308 GMT later that day, a Hurricane Hunters flight reported the existence of a tropical depression; it was classified as Tropical Depression Thirteen, while located about 240 miles (390 km) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River. With a ridge of high pressure located over the southeastern United States, the depression continued tracking generally westward and intensified into Tropical Storm Elena late on August 30. Elena was the sixth tropical storm of the season, as Hurricane Frederic attained tropical storm status six hours prior to Elena. Unfavorable northerly vertical wind shear persisted through much of Elena's duration, which prohibited the development of convection. An approaching frontal trough weakened the high pressure system to its north, which resulted in Elena turning northwestward toward the Texas coastline. The storm remained poorly organized, failing to strengthen further, and on September 1 it made landfall on Matagorda Island as a minimal tropical storm. The cyclone rapidly weakened after moving ashore, and early on September 2 Elena degenerated into a remnant low pressure area over southeastern Texas. Trapped between two high pressure systems, the remnant mid-level circulation drifted southwestward just inland for several days before dissipating on September 6. Impact Rainfall Summary for Tropical Storm Elena As Elena was upgraded to a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center issued a gale warning from Port O'Connor, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana; these remained in effect until the storm moved ashore. Winds were fairly minor in association with the storm; a station in Galveston, Texas recorded a peak wind gust of 46 mph (74 km/h). As Elena moved ashore, it produced a 3-foot (0.9 m) storm tide at Galveston and Baytown. Rainfall from the storm was generally limited to the coastline, and peaked at 10.3 inches (261 mm) at Palacios; light rainfall also extended along the coastline of Louisiana. Near Houston, 4.6 inches (117 mm) of precipitation was reported, which caused two drownings from flooding. Overall storm damage was fairly minor, totaling to less than $10 million (1979 USD, $28 million 2007 USD). At a dock owned by Shell Oil Company in Deer Park near Houston, a lightning bolt from thunderstorms of Elena struck the oil supertanker SS Chevron Hawaii. The lightning started a fire on the ship, which expanded and wrecked one adjacent barge and burned nearby docks. The ship was nearly split in half from the lightning strike, and oil seeped into Houston Ship Channel for several hours. Firefighters combated the fire on the tanker in boats, but their efforts were hindered due to unsettled weather from Elena, as well as unsafe water to travel through. The fire caused three deaths and 13 injuries, and damage related to the incident totaled $27 million (1979 USD, $76 million 2007 USD).

It is organized under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which means it is a tax-exempt, non-profit foundation that does not engage in lobbying.26 U.S. Code Section 501. The Institute's main sources of funding are corporations, other foundations, and individual donors. History and philosophy The Lexington Institute was founded in 1998 by former U.S. Representative James Courter (R-NJ), former congressional aide Merrick Carey, and former Georgetown University professor Loren Thompson. As of July 2018, they are respectively the chairman, chief executive officer and chief operating officer of the Institute. The institute's political philosophy is center-right, peace through strength, defense of U.S. economic interests, energy independence, and market-driven solutions to social needs. Although the organization's mission statement does not describe it as \\"conservative\\" or \\"libertarian,\\" it opposes tax increases, the creation of entitlements, and federal intervention in the daily lives of citizens. =Defense policy= The Lexington Institute has been called the \\"defense industry's pay-to-play ad agency\\", since it receives funding from military contractors and issues a stream of reports, usually favorable, about the performance and status of weapons programs. However, institute staffers are frequently critical of particular weapons or policies, assailing (among other things) the Navy's next-generation destroyer, the Army's future troop carrier, a proposed joint replacement for the Humvee light tactical vehicle and most of the acquisition reform measures proposed during the Obama Administration. Media citations frequently note that Lexington staffers have ties to military contractors. Thompson stated, \\"I'm not going to work on a project unless somebody, somewhere, is willing to pay. This is a business. My bottom line is that if what I write and say is true, it doesn't really matter what my motives are.\\" Lexington analyst Loren Thompson has said that \\"the United States cannot continue to spend, especially on defense, the way it has been over the past decade.\\"Spires, Shelby G. \\"Expert: Federal spending freeze beats alternative.\\" The Sun, 7 February 2011. Archived from the original on February 1, 2019. He has also called for a shift in American defense spending towards items such as the Littoral Combat Ship and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II that can be exported to allies. =Politics= The Institute also covers purely political topics. For example, Thompson wrote that most of the candidates in the 2012 U.S. Republican presidential primary were \\"unsuited to high office\\". =Energy= The Lexington Institute’s energy efforts focus on improving the resiliency and reliability of the U.S. electricity grid. Constance Douris, Vice President of the Lexington Institute, manages the energy portfolio and regularly writes about this subject in her Forbes column. Most recently, Douris has published articles about how electric vehicles impact the electric grid. She has spoken about this on CBS Radio and RealClearEnergy has featured her work. Douris also gave a speech on cybersecurity of the grid at EnergySec's Distribution Security Forum in March 2018. The Institute hosted a \\"Cybersecurity of the Electric Grid\\" Capitol Hill Forum on June 8, 2018. Lexington analyzed California’s decision to provide a financial reward when utilities adopt distributed energy resources. A white paper titled \\"California Aims To Incentivize Utilities To Adopt Third-Party Energy Resources\\" written by Douris was released in March 2017. Articles about distributed sources have been published in Forbes and other media outlets. With the aim of identifying a reasonable balance between access to and privacy of data generated from the smart grid, Lexington hosted a Capitol Hill event titled \\"Securing Smart Grid Data\\" in May 2017. Lexington published \\"Balancing Smart Grid Data and Consumer Privacy\\" in July 2017. Lexington has also published articles on how to balance privacy and smart grid data access. To improve the cybersecurity of the electric grid, the think tank released \\"Cyber Threat Data Sharing Needs Refinement\\" in August 2017.

He earned his undergraduate degree from FSU in 1969 and his law degree from FSU in 1972. Upbringing and education Pajcic was raised in Jacksonville. He attended Annie R. Morgan Elementary School, Paxon Middle School, and Paxon High School. \\"Gary and Steve Pajcic donate $1 million to help bring veteran teachers to challenged schools in Duval County\\"], Florida Department of Education website, April 29, 2002. At Paxon High, he played football, basketball and baseball. He was the first player to be named Most Outstanding Football and Basketball player in Duval County. Pajcic was honored as Scholar-Athlete for the State of Florida. College Pajcic played a big role in the success of teammate Ron Sellers, his friend from early childhood, who eventually was a 1968 first team All-American, sixth pick overall in the first round of the 1969 NFL draft, and played five years of professional football. Pajcic was a sought-after recruit, but had made a pact with Sellers that the two would go to college together as a quarterback/receiver combination. University of Florida wanted Pajcic, but not Sellers, so the pair instead went to Florida State University.Lamar, Jim: Osceola, August 2, 2006, \\"'Pacjij' just a prince of a man\\" A freshman star in 1965, Pajcic became FSU's starting quarterback in 1966. That was the season he threw the pass that resulted in \\"The Catch\\", the most controversial play in Florida State football history. In the home game against rival University of Florida, FSU trailed by 3 with less than a minute left in the fourth quarter. Lane Fenner, who was fresh because he had not yet played in the game, replaced Sellers, who had taken a blow in the last play. At the snap, he blew past the Gator defensive backs and Pajcic threw a perfect 45-yard pass to Fenner in the end zone, who caught it over-the-shoulder. The crowd erupted, but a few seconds later, the linesman, who trailed the play from the line of scrimmage, arrived at the goal line and signaled the catch out of bounds. Pictures in newspapers the following day seem to support the claim that he was in-bounds and many Seminoles regard this event as the start of their bitter rivalry with the Gators. FSU Football History, \\"The Great Game Robbery\\" With eight touchdowns and an impressive throwing record, Pajcic was named honorable mention All-America honors in '66, though an arm injury in 1966 hampered the rest of his college career. Law Pajcic passed the Florida Bar and started as an Assistant State Attorney in Jacksonville in 1972. Within 18 months, he was promoted to Division chief, then accepted the position of Assistant General Counsel for the City of Jacksonville in 1974. Also that year, Gary and brother Steve Pajcic decided to go into private practice together, forming Pajcic & Pajcic. Politics Gary Pajcic managed brother Steve Pajcic's unsuccessful campaign for Florida governor in 1986. In 1995, Gary Pajcic and his brother Steve managed Nat Glover's campaign to become Jacksonville's first African-American sheriff. Most political \\"experts\\" gave Glover little chance of success, but against the odds, the Pajcic brothers campaign strategy gave Sheriff Nat Glover a victory. Philanthropy in education Besides working as an attorney, Pajcic remained an active proponent of education as a private citizen. In 1992, Pajcic and his brother, Steve, established a million dollar endowment at the University of North Florida to pay the full tuition of any graduate of their alma mater, Paxon High School, who was accepted and enrolled at UNF. Other significant donations include $1 million to bring better teachers to Jacksonville elementary schools and a 2002 gift of $1 million to Seminole Boosters, which Pajcic also served as a member of the national board of directors. That same year, Pajcic and his brother donated another $1 million to boost education at five inner-city elementary schools in Jacksonville Diamond, Laura, \\"CORE program draws praise, ideas from education groups\\", dtujax.com; accessed July 29, 2017. including Annie R. Morgan elementary school, which both brothers had attended. Two other high-profile donations included $100,000 to the Warrick Dunn Foundation to help single mothers buy their first homes and $100,000 to former Florida quarterback Danny Wuerffel's Desire Street Ministries to help victims of Hurricane Katrina. Death Pajcic fell ill on a Friday night, experiencing chills that had developed by Saturday into a fever. He was hospitalized on Sunday after having a seizure and fell into a coma. On Wednesday, August 2, 2006, he was taken off life support and died. He was 58 years old. Tests confirmed that he had contracted viral encephalitis.

The personnel consist primarily of around 50 Police Staff, mainly IT professionals specialising in a range of discrete technologies, with a large contingent of those staff Java EE developers and Oracle DBAs. SPSA-ICT also retains a small number of development staff specialising in .NET technologies. Non-technical members of staff include project managers, administrative staff, internal personnel resources, software testers, senior management, and a very small number of seconded police officers with specialist knowledge of the areas impacted by projects under construction. Seconded police officers are drawn from Scotland's eight police forces, and from SPSA-Criminal Justice (formerly SCRO).  Projects Undertaken  = The Scottish Intelligence Database (SID)= The Scottish Intelligence Database was designed by an external supplier, ABM United Kingdom Limited, under the supervision of a team from SPIS, headed by Detective Superintendent Ian McCandlish, seconded from Strathclyde Police. In respect of his involvement with the SID Project, Det Supt McCandlish was a contributor to the Bichard Inquiry (concerning the 2002 murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman by Ian Huntley, in particular the concerns that case raised regarding how a person with Huntley's police record and background could have been approved to work in proximity to children). = Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR2)= The ANPR2 Project is an ongoing SPSA-ICT project, concerning the provision of automated number plate recognition (ANPR) technologies to the Scottish Police Service. Notable/controversial aspects of the technologies employed in the project include the collection of information via hidden cameras, concealed in cats eyes in the road. = The Scottish Criminal Records Office replacement system = The Scottish Criminal Records Office replacement system, also known as the Criminal History System (CHS), was developed by SPIS for SCRO (now known as Scottish Police Services Authority - Criminal Justice, or SPSA-CJ for short). The CHS Project was undertaken between 2001 and 2007. It was implemented using Java EE and Oracle, with Hibernate and Spring. The Project proved problematic for SPIS / SPSA-ICT, eventually culminating in negative news coverage and questions being asked in the Scottish Parliament regarding the cost of the system, the rationale of its design, and the way it had been managed (see Controversy and External Criticism below). = Scottish National Firearms Certificate Holders Register (SNFCHR) = The SNFCHR project was developed by SPIS between 1995 and 2005. In July 2005 a decision was made that an off-the- shelf software package that was already being used by several English police forces provided a better-value solution to the issue of maintaining a register of persons authorised to keep firearms, and as a consequence the SNFCHR project was cancelled. = The National Custody System = The National Custody System was designed for the .NET and Oracle platforms. Initial scoping and design work took place between November 2002 and January 2007, with first rollout of the system to a Scottish Force (Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary) taking place in February 2007. As of January 2008, the system is currently being reviewed for rollout within a second Scottish force, Strathclyde Police. = Human Resources System = The HRS Project aimed to provide a single, coherent personnel system to the Scottish Police Service. Another personnel system, originally developed internally by Tayside Police, known as SCOPE, also remained in use, however. As a combined result of the move from SPIS to SPSA-ICT, and of the elements within Tayside Police responsible for SCOPE also moving to come under the SPSA, as of April 2007, the SPSA is effectively maintaining two, essentially competing, systems geared at providing a personnel management solution. A decision has still to be made regarding which of the two systems will go on to become the single system originally envisaged. This issue is complicated by the fact that different forces in Scotland independently use each system, and by the fact that some of SPSA- ICT's own projects (for example, the National Custody Project) are actually designed to interface solely with the SCOPE solution that was developed by Tayside Police, rather than the HRS solution that was developed by their own staff.  Controversy and external criticism  SPIS, and later SPSA-ICT, came under considerable public criticism for their handling of the delivery of the Criminal History System project. The cost of the system rose from an initial estimate of £1.5m, to an eventual bill of over ten times that amount. In addition to the cost overrun, the system was delivered more than three years later than even a revised estimate of the delivery date, and did not provide any new capabilities that the system it was intended to replace had previously provided. In the most literal sense, the new system was an exact replica of the 1980s-style green-screen, unifont, text-only system that preceded it; the only difference was that this exactly identical interface was presented to users via a secure web browser, rather than via a mainframe terminal. The rationale given for this decision to re-invent an outdated wheel was that proceeding this way would save on training costs for existing staff. This was widely perceived as incredibly shortsighted, given that staff retire or leave and are replaced on a rolling basis, and that consequently the training of new staff will therefore always be an issue, regardless of the nature of the system they require to be trained upon. Additionally, as the new system did not take full advantage of the considerable advances in information technology that have come along since the original 1980's design was envisaged, it was felt that a chance to significantly enhance the safety and efficiency of, for example, the processes that allow persons to be vetted for working with children had been missed. Questions about SPIS / SPSA-ICT's handling of the project were raised in the Scottish news media, by the BBC News, and by an opposition MSP, Stewart Maxwell, in the Scottish Parliament, who called the project \\"a complete disaster\\". The net result of the criticism received was that an external software supplier, Real Time Engineering, was brought in to provide Development expertise and Project Management oversight to the project during the period Summer 2005 - Autumn 2007.

He became the first, and still remains the only, Australian to climb all 14 \\"eight-thousanders\\" (the peaks over 8,000-metres above sea level) on 2 October 2009, and is the 18th person to ever complete this feat. He climbed 13 of the 14 without using bottled oxygen, only using it on Mount Everest, which he has summited twice.Andrew Lock is the most successful athlete most Australians have never heard of. Andrew Lock is the first Australian to successfully climb all 14 of the world’s 8000-metre peaks, including four that he has summited twice. He retired from eight-thousander climbing in 2012. Climbing His preferred climbing style is in very small teams, mostly climbing without even sherpa support, and without the use of bottled oxygen (except on Everest). His physical ability to perform at high altitude has been noted by other Himalayan climbers.Climbing unsupported, and sometimes solo like Andrew did, takes a staggering resistance to physical discomfort, not to mention a calm acceptance that the following day could easily be your last. Not only is he supremely fit, but he must have a physiology shared by only a few people. He is obviously super strong at high altitude. The length of some of his summit days – in terms of vertical altitude gain and the number of hours he stayed on his feet – would have polished off most of us before we were halfway through them. The term \\"gritty\\" is often used to describe Lock, and he is noted for his understated and self- depreciating manner. Unusually for a long-standing high-altitude climber, Lock has lost no digits to frostbite. Climbing all 14 eight-thousanders, and surviving, is an uncommon feat as the deaths-to-summits ratio on some of the mountains is at one-in-five (including Annapurna, K2, Nanga Parbat, Kangchenjunga), and it often takes more than one attempt, on average, to climb an eight-thousander (Lock has an overall eight-thousander success rate of circa 50%). He has achieved six first Australian ascents of eight-thousanders, namely Dhaulagiri, Nanga Parbat, Hidden Peak, Manaslu, Annapurna, and Shishapangma. He has made four solo ascents of eight-thousanders, namely Lhotse, Broad Peak, Shishapangma Central and Cho Oyu. He summited Mount Everest twice. His first 8,000-metre summit was of K2, which he climbed in 1993 with a small team that included legendary Himalayan climber Anatoli Boukreev, who later died in 1997 on Annapurna. The \\"Savage Mountain\\" lived up to its fearsome reputation when three of his summit partners were killed in separate falls (on the same face), and Lock rescued a Swedish climber. In 2004, he was a climber and cinematographer for the acclaimed Discovery Channel six-part miniseries, Discovery Channel-Ultimate Survival: Everest, which has been broadcast many times in North America. On that expedition, Lock had to rescue three members of other teams coming down from the summit, giving up his own oxygen along the way. Lock has climbed with several leading high-altitude Himalayan mountaineers, including Anatoli Boukreev (K2 in 1993), Göran Kropp (Broad Peak in 1994), Doug Scott and Wojciech Kurtyka (Nanga Parbat Mazeno Ridge in 1995), and Iván Vallejo & Iñaki Ochoa de Olza (Annapurna 2007). After Ecuadorian Iván Vallejo, Lock is the second, and still the only other, Southern Hemisphere climber to complete all 14 eight-thousanders. While Lock has climbed with partners that he did not particularly enjoy, or get on with, his unhappy experience when climbing with U.K. mountaineer Alan Hinkes (who claims to have climbed all 14 eight-thousanders, although one is disputed), on Nanga Parbat in 1998, is recounted in his book, Summit 8000. In May 2011, Lock attempted Everest for the third time, but his first without supplementary oxygen (to complete the rarer Reinhold Messner feat of climbing all 14 eight- thousanders without oxygen). His solo climb of Everest's North Ridge was unsuccessful due to high winds and blizzard conditions.Howling winds and the threat of frostbite have thwarted Australian mountaineer Andrew Lock's attempt to reach the summit of Mount Everest alone, and without oxygen. Lock made a second attempt to summit Everest solo, via the North side, without supplementary oxygen in May 2012, but abandoned the climb 300 metres from the summit due to self diagnosed early symptoms of Cerebral Oedema.High on the slopes of Mt Everest a fortnight ago, and haunted by hallucinations of giant bats, 50-year-old Lock made the decision to give up the fate-tempting game of high-altitude mountaineering. [This was incorrectly reported as High altitude pulmonary oedema]. Lock retired from personal high-altitude climbing after his 2012 Everest experience, however, a final \\"oxygenless\\" ascent of Everest (his third Everest ascent), remains a potential project. He continues to guide commercial expeditions to Mt Everest and other peaks in the Himalaya and around the world, specialising in small teams with high logistical support. Personal In 2009 Lock was awarded the Australian Geographic Society's Adventurer of the Year award. On 13 June 2011, Lock was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to mountaineering. Lock is an ambassador of the Sir David Martin Foundation. Lock is the author of SUMMIT 8000 which was published in Australia and New Zealand in 2014, and MASTER OF THIN AIR, which was published in the United States of America in 2015.

The accidental discovery of her intact tomb during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 has provided an opportunity for patriotic demonstrations. She was the only 12th-century Hungarian queen whose remains were studied by scientists, and her appearance was reconstructed. Life She was the daughter of Raynald of Châtillon,Bernard Hamilton, The Leper King and His Heirs: Baldwin IV and the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, (Cambridge University Press, 2000), 104-105. and Constance, Princess of Antioch.Guida Myrl Jackson-Laufer, Women Rulers Throughout the Ages: An Illustrated Guide, (ABC-CLIO, 1999), 104. The exact date of her birth is uncertain. It is assumed that she was born soon after the secret marriage of her parents, which took place before May 1153. The most common belief in historiography was that Agnes was born in 1154.M. Wertner: Az Árpádok családi története, Nagy-Becskerek 1892, p. 359; History of Hungary, ed. E. Pamlenyi, London 1975, p. 60, 608; J. Louda, M. MacLagan: Lines of Succession: Heraldry of the Royal Families of Europe, ed. II, London 1999, table 89. At the baptism she probably received the name of Agnes.Chronicler Alberic of Trois-Fontaines named Agnes one of the three daughters born from Constance and Raynald who was also the wife of the King of Hungary Béla (Chronica Albrici Monachi Trium Fontium [in:] Monumenta Germaniae Historica, XXIII, Hannover 1874, pp. 849–850). By contrast, in a fragmentary manuscript preserved from Lignages d'Outre-Mer and stored in the Vatican Library (Vaticanus Latinus 7806, Il parentado de Beimonte principe 9, fol. 172), are mentioned only two daughters from Constance and Raynald, who are named Joanna and Maria. =In Constantinople. Marriage= Her father was captured by the Muslims in November 1160 and was confined in Aleppo for the next fifteen years. Princess Constance died ca. 1163/67, and around 1170 Agnes went to Constantinople, where her older half-sister Maria had been living as the wife of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus.S. Runciman: A History of the Crusades, t. II, Harmandsworth 1978, p. 365. On the Emperor's request, Agnes was married to Caesar Alexios (born prince Béla of Hungary), who had been engaged to the Emperor's daughter, Maria Comnena until the birth of Manuel's son, Alexios in 1166. The wedding date of Agnes and Alexios is unknown; is believed that may have occurred about 1168W. Dworzaczek: Genealogia, Warsaw 1959, table 84. and no later than 1172.V. ö. Városy: Antiochiai Anna királyné, \\"Századok. A Magyar Történelmi Társulat Közlönye\\", 1886, p. 866. In historiography, there are two precises dated for the wedding: September 1169P. Gautier: Les lettres de Grégoire, higoumène d'Oxia, \\"Revue des études byzantines\\", 31–32, 1973, p. 206: After the birth of the heir to Byzantine throne, the Emperor broke off the engagement between his daughter Maria and Caesar Alexios (later Bela III) and as a compensation he was married with the sister of Empress Maria of Antioch. and March 1171.L. Garland, A. Stone: Maria Porphyrogenita, daughter of Manuel I Comnenus [in:] De Imperatoribus Romanis: An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Rulers and Their Families 2006 [retrieved 30 March 2015]: Agnes was visiting Constantinople with her brother Bohemond III of Antioch when she was engaged. She received the name Anna in the imperial court. In the Hungarians documents she always appeared with her new name,M. Wertner: Az Árpádok családi története, Nagybecskerek 1892, p. 358. probably because Agnes was rare at that time. =Queen of Hungary= The new couple went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem where they made a donation for the Knights Hospitaller. In the summer, after the death of King Stephen III of Hungary (4 March 1172), her husband ascended the throne as King Béla III, and they moved to Hungary. Anna was crowned queen alongside her husband at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Stephen in Székesfehérvár on 13 January 1173.A magyar királyok koronázótemploma in: www.szikm.hu [retrieved 30 March 2015]. The spread of French cultural patterns in the Kingdom of Hungary is attributed to Anna/Agnes.G. Lukács: La Hongrie et la civilisation, Paris 1929, p. 361; A. Echols, M. Williams: An annotated index of medieval women, New York-Oxford 1992, p. 53; G. Moravcsik: Byzantium and the Magyars, Budapest–Amsterdam 1970, p. 129; G. Klaniczay: The chaste prince and the athleta patriae [in:] G. Klaniczay: Holy Rulers and Blessed Princesses. Dynastic Cults in Medieval Central Europe, Budapest 2002, p. 184. In many publications emphasizes, however, that Béla III followed the Western European model after his life at the Byzantine court of Manuel I. The Queen's activities were also connected with the presence in Hungary of the first Cistercian monks, who came from Burgundy. Anna could keep in touch with Burgundian Cistercians through ancestral linkages. The first Cistercian monastery in Hungary, founded in 1182, was in fact closely associated with three Cistercian abbeys located near Pontigny and the surrounding estates belonged to the Donzy family, from which Anna descended.M.

Kristo (ed.): Korai magyar térténeti lexikon, Budapest 1994, p. 473, 479-480. =Issue= During her marriage, Anna gave birth to at least sixIldikó Hankó: Királyaink tömegsírban, 2004, attributed a seventh child to Anna, an unnamed daughter.

Dworzaczek, Genealogia, Warsaw 1959, table 84. Anna was the ancestress of all subsequent Kings of Hungary, as well as the Hungarian princesses, and by marriage of the Piast Duchesses St. Kinga and Bl. Jolenta of Poland. In addition, from her descended the Kings of Bohemia from the Přemyslid, Luxembourg, Jagiellon and Habsburg families.D. Piwowarczyk: Słynni rycerze Europy. Rycerze Chrystusa, Warsaw 2007, p. 309. =Death= Anna's death date was not recorded in any contemporary source, but it is assumed that she died in the year 1184,W. Dworzaczek: Genealogia, Warszawa 1959, table 84; A. Echols, M. Williams: An annotated index of medieval women, New York-Oxford 1992, p. 53. although it is possible she died a little earlier than that.M. Wertner: Az Árpádok családi története, Nagy-Becskerek 1892, p. 356; Ildikó Hankó: Királyaink tömegsírban, 2004 - year 1183. Burial Anna was buried at Cathedral Basilica of Saint Stephen in Székesfehérvár. Her remains were confidently identified by archeologists during late 19th century excavations at the ruined cathedral of Székesfehérvár. Her remains were afterwards reinterred at the Mathias Church in Budapest, with those of her husband.

Cyperus erythrorhizos is a plant of wet areas such as rivers and ditches, generally at low elevations. It gets its common and scientific names from the red color of its roots. This sedge grows to a maximum of a meter in height, but is usually quite a bit shorter. It may have a number of long, wispy leaves around the base of the plant. The inflorescence may contain one to several spikes, each spike containing 20 to over 100 spikelets. Each spikelet is light greenish brown to reddish brown and is made up of up to 30 bracted flowers. The fruit is a glossy achene about a millimeter long.
