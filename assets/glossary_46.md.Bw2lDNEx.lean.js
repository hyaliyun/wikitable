The car took its name from two of the founders of the company; Robert C Davis and Charles J Bour. Production of the car was started in Detroit, before moving to Frankfort, Indiana, in 1918. A distinctive feature of the Model 17 and Model 18B cars built in Detroit and Frankfort was the slightly slanted and pointed radiator. Prices ranged from $1250 to $1500 in 1916, rising to $1650 in 1919. In 1918 the company was taken over by the Shadbourne Brothers of Chicago, who reorganised the company, with production now located in Shreveport, Louisiana, from 1919 onwards. Company advertising placed heavy emphasis on the Bour-Davis's new home, with the car being referred to as the \\"Pride of Shreveport\\". A contest was held amongst readers of the \\"Shreveport Times\\" for a new name for the car. Although the name \\"Louisianne\\" was chosen, this name was never adopted. Features of the Bour-Davis included a radiator placed slightly ahead of the front axle, and the continuation of the leather front seat over the seat's top and down to the rear floor. The Model 21 and Model 21S were powered by a Continental Straight-6 engine, with prices ranging from $1700 for a 1920 Model 20 tourer, up to $2300 for a 1922 Model 21S tourer. In 1923 the company was taken over by JM Ponder and the Ponder Motor Manufacturing Company, but lack of finance lead to production never occurring. Total production of the Bour-Davis between 1916 and 1922 was approximately 1500 cars.

They use an unconventional delayed blowback system combined with in-line design to reduce perceived recoil and muzzle climb.  History  KRISS Vector SMG on a shooting range at the 2010 leftIn the spring of 2007, TDI announced their development of a new submachine gun. It was an experimental weapon under advanced stages of development at that time. The name Kriss comes from a Southeast Asian dagger with a flame-shaped blade.Future Weapons, Season 2 episode 10, first broadcast March 17 2007 The second generation prototype of the Vector, called the K10, was announced at 2011 SHOT Show. It is a slightly more compact version of the Vector that is based on the same Super V system. The main difference is a redesign of the lower receiver intended for easy caliber interchangeability; utilizing just a single takedown pin, users can change between 9x19mm, .40 S&W; and .45 ACP by mounting different lower receivers. This also brought a redesign of the charging handle, which now travels diagonally, almost vertically, and can be mounted on either side of the weapon. Other notable differences were a new telescoping stock instead of a folding one, and a four-sided accessory rail tube around the barrel. The K10 was not displayed after SHOT Show 2013 and its status is unknown and likely has been canceled. Kriss announced \\"Gen II\\" versions of the original Vector models in 2015. These feature a redesigned pistol grip, trigger, safety selector, and compatibility with a new 9x19mm lower. These appear to have replaced the K10 prototypes, though no features from the K10 were carried over.  Design  leftThe Vector uses an articulated mechanism referred to as the \\"Kriss Super V,\\" which allows the bolt and an inertia block to move downward into a recess behind the magazine well. The theory is that at the end of this travel, the energy is transmitted downward rather than rearward, thus reducing the felt recoil. When fired, the barrel axis is in line with the shoulder as in the M16 rifle, but also in line with the shooter's hand. This is intended to reduce muzzle climb when combined with the off-axis bolt travel, though it also greatly raises the sight line in comparison to the bore axis. The initial prototype model by TDI achieved a rate of fire of 1,500 rounds per minute, though this was brought down to around 1,200 rounds per minute on the production models. Civilian models are limited to semi-automatic only. The Vector is split into two major assemblies in a similar manner to the AR-15 rifle, secured together with four push pins. Due to the weapon's unusual layout, the lower contains the action, charging handle, magazine well and barrel, while the upper contains the ejection port, rail system, pistol grip and fire control components, as well as the stock for configurations that have one. This modular design allows for toolless caliber conversions by swapping out only the lower. The Vector's safety is ambidextrous (as well as the fire mode selector on the auto trigger pack) while the ejection port, charging handle, bolt release catch and magazine release are not, and are only available in a right-handed configuration. Calibers such as .22 LR, .40 S&W; and 9√ó19mm Parabellum were mentioned when the gun was first released. The Gen II versions with multiple design changes including a new 9mm variant were confirmed at SHOT Show 2015,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV8vfXzY0TQ though the .22LR version had yet to materialize and was thought to have been canceled up until SHOT Show 2020, when they announced its release. Vector‚Äôs chambered in .45 ACP are designed to accept standard Glock 21 pistol magazines. A special \\"MagEx 30\\" kit was available to convert a factory 13-round .45 ACP Glock magazine to an extended high-capacity version, but was later marketed as a \\"25+\\" round kit. Vector‚Äôs chambered in 9√ó19mm Parabellum uses standard Glock 17 magazines. In 2019, KRISS released the \\"MagEx2\\" which extends the capacity of a factory standard Glock Magazine. The MagEx 2 is available in 9mm for an overall capacity of 40 rounds, 33 rounds of 10mm and 30 rounds of .45 ACP.  Variants  The KRIS Vector has undergone two generations of modification. The Gen I version is the baseline model of the Vector family. It was later replaced by the improved Gen II version which features a redesigned pistol grip and trigger and has the swing angle of the safety lever reduced from 120 to 45 degrees. It also eliminates the opening above the barrel for the original weapon's optional Surefire weapon light, since these are no longer manufactured. In addition to the original Flat Black finish, optional factory Cerakote coatings now come in Olive Drab (green), Flat Dark Earth (tan), Alpine (white), or Combat Gray. The Vector SMG variant is only available for military and law enforcement use. It features a 5.5-inch barrel (with an option of a 6.5-inch barrel on the Gen II version), a folding stock, flip-up Midwest Industries back-up iron sights (BUIS) (MagPul MBUS on Gen II weapons), a full-length Picatinny rail for mounting various optics/scopes, and either two mode fire selector (single and full-auto) or a three mode fire selector (single, two-round burst and full-auto). It is only sold as a complete weapon in .45 ACP and 9√ó19mm Parabellum, though due to the nature of the weapon the auto trigger pack is compatible with any Vector lower. The 9mm model uses Glock 17-compatible magazines (typically the extended 33-rounder used by the Glock 18) and the .45-caliber model uses Glock 21 magazines. Semi-automatic variants are produced and available for the US civilian market. There are three main configurations, the Vector CRB, Vector SBR and Vector SDP. In addition to 9√ó19mm Parabellum and .45 ACP, they can also be chambered in .40 S&W; (using Glock 22 magazines), 10mm Auto (using Glock 20 magazines), or .357 SIG (using Glock 31 magazines). A variant chambered for 9√ó21mm IMI that feeds from standard 9√ó19mm Glock 17 magazines is available for the Italian civilian market. The .22 LR variant feeds from a proprietary 10 round magazine, and functions using a traditional straight blowback operating system rather than the Super V delayed system. The Canadian (and some American) civil market versions only come with the blocked 10-round magazines rather than the full capacity magazines. Like the Law Enforcement / Military SMG models, the civilian model Vectors can be converted to chamber and fire other calibers if the lower receiver groups are changed. KRISS Vector CRB 18.6 inch barrel (Canadian version) * The Vector CRB (carbine) is a semi-automatic carbine with a permanently affixed extension to the standard 5.5-inch barrel, extending it to , intended for states with short-barrel rifle bans, with an 18.6-inch (470 mm) version produced for the Canadian market. The standard model has a folding stock (fixed in states where state law prohibits). Variants exist for compliance with various state gun laws, including a California-legal \\"featureless\\" variant with a Kydex grip-wrap barrier (prohibits gripping the back of the pistol grip), a hand stop replacing the usual vertical foregrip, and a permanently affixed Defiance DS150 stock to give an overall length of 36.5-inch (930 mm). * The Vector SBR (Short Barrel Rifle) is a semi-automatic short-barreled configuration featuring the same 5.5-inch barrel as the selective fire submachine gun. * The Vector SDP (Special Duty Pistol) is a semi-automatic pistol configuration that has a permanently affixed cap with a sling mount in place of a folding stock. There is also a configuration of the Vector SDP fitted with an SB Tactical arm brace called the Vector SDP-SB (Special Duty Pistol - Stabilizing Brace).https://kriss- usa.com/pistols/stabilizing-brace/vector-sdp-sb-black The \\"Enhanced\\" versions of the Gen II CRB and SBR are also available with collapsing M4-style stock adaptors instead of the standard folding stock (with a Magpul UBR stock included) and a rectangular barrel shroud for the CRB, though these accessories can also be purchased separately.  Derivatives  KRISS announced development of a semi-automatic pistol called the \\"KRISS KARD\\" in 2010, using the Super V system in a much smaller package to minimize recoil and muzzle rise in 9√ó19mm Parabellum and .45 ACP calibers. It does not have a blowback slide, instead it has a T-shaped cocking handle on the rear. As TDI, Kriss also announced a 12-gauge shotgun called the MVS and a .50 BMG heavy machine gun using a double Super V mechanism called the \\"Disraptor,\\" but the Disraptor has not been mentioned since their name change, while the MVS was removed from the TDI website in late 2009.

Ecotechnics thinks of the body as a technology which makes possible the inclusion of a whole new range of bodies. This gives people more agency and biopower over their own use of their bodies. This makes it usable for queer theory and disability studies. An interpretation also refers to the term as the craft of the home. In classifying the body as a technical object, Jean-Luc Nancy explained how it works by partitioning bodies into their own zones and spaces, which also allow such bodies to connect with other bodies. Hence, Nancy claims that technology determine our interactions with other beings in the world. Ecotechnics is also central in Sullivan's and Murray's collection of essays Queering the Technologisation of Bodies. It is built on Bernard Stiegler's work that sees the body and technology as a double process: the technology and the body are informed by each other. Derrida who extends on both Nancy and Stiegler's ideas argues that the 'proper body' implicates interconnections of technical additions. Ecotechnics goes against the essentialist and binary notion of the body as a technological object which positions it within post-structuralism. The body can only be understood within its environment and this environment is a technical one. Nancy also applied the ecotechnics concept to contemporary issues such as war and globalization. He maintained, for instance, that modern conflicts are produced by the dividing lines between: North and South; rich and poor; and, integrated and excluded. He also believes that ecotechnics is undoing communities due to the elimination of the polis and the prevalence of oikos, calling for a global sovereignty that would administer the world as a single household.

The second and third main theorems allow refinements of orthogonality relations for ordinary characters which may be applied in finite group theory. These do not presently admit a proof purely in terms of ordinary characters. All three main theorems are stated in terms of the Brauer correspondence. Brauer correspondence There are many ways to extend the definition which follows, but this is close to the early treatments by Brauer. Let G be a finite group, p be a prime, F be a field of characteristic p. Let H be a subgroup of G which contains :QC_G(Q) for some p-subgroup Q of G, and is contained in the normalizer :N_G(Q), where C_G(Q) is the centralizer of Q in G. The Brauer homomorphism (with respect to H) is a linear map from the center of the group algebra of G over F to the corresponding algebra for H. Specifically, it is the restriction to Z(FG) of the (linear) projection from FG to FC_G(Q) whose kernel is spanned by the elements of G outside C_G(Q). The image of this map is contained in Z(FH), and it transpires that the map is also a ring homomorphism. Since it is a ring homomorphism, for any block B of FG, the Brauer homomorphism sends the identity element of B either to 0 or to an idempotent element. In the latter case, the idempotent may be decomposed as a sum of (mutually orthogonal) primitive idempotents of Z(FH). Each of these primitive idempotents is the multiplicative identity of some block of FH. The block b of FH is said to be a Brauer correspondent of B if its identity element occurs in this decomposition of the image of the identity of B under the Brauer homomorphism. Brauer's first main theorem Brauer's first main theorem states that if G is a finite group and D is a p-subgroup of G, then there is a bijection between the set of (characteristic p) blocks of G with defect group D and blocks of the normalizer N_G(D) with defect group D. This bijection arises because when H = N_G(D), each block of G with defect group D has a unique Brauer correspondent block of H, which also has defect group D. Brauer's second main theorem Brauer's second main theorem gives, for an element t whose order is a power of a prime p, a criterion for a (characteristic p) block of C_G(t) to correspond to a given block of G, via generalized decomposition numbers. These are the coefficients which occur when the restrictions of ordinary characters of G (from the given block) to elements of the form tu, where u ranges over elements of order prime to p in C_G(t), are written as linear combinations of the irreducible Brauer characters of C_G(t). The content of the theorem is that it is only necessary to use Brauer characters from blocks of C_G(t) which are Brauer correspondents of the chosen block of G. Brauer's third main theorem Brauer's third main theorem states that when Q is a p-subgroup of the finite group G, and H is a subgroup of G, containing QC_G(Q), and contained in N_G(Q), then the principal block of H is the only Brauer correspondent of the principal block of G (where the blocks referred to are calculated in characteristic p).

Situated near the Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border and about 6 km from Gauribidanur, it played a major role in the Indian independence movement.  Etymology  The name Vidurashwatha is derived from that of a big Ashwatha (sacred fig) tree located in this village.http://www.gowribidanurtown.mrc.gov.in/Tourism According to a legend of the times of Mahabharata, this tree was planted by Vidura, a courtier in the kingdom of Dhritarashtra; and hence the name Vidurashwatha.A brief description of Vidurashwatha is provided by In 2001, this ancient tree fell to the ground.Vidurashwatha: End of Flora-era The legend says that Yamadharma Raja was cursed to be born as a human being and was thus born as Vidura. After seeing all the bloodshed during the war, Vidura became remorseful and asked Krishna for salvation. Krishna asked him to go for a theerthayatra (pilgrimage). After visiting many places, Vidura came to this place, which was actually a hermitage of Maithreya Maharishi. Once during sandhyavandhana in the river, Vidura got a small sapling when he was about to offer argya to Surya. Maithreya Maharishi asked Vidura to worship the sapling to get salvation. With great devotion, Vidura worshiped the sapling and Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, pleased with the devotion, gave him dharshan, and thus the name of the location became Vidura Ashwatha. Another story is that, a long time ago when the river was flowing rapidly, two brothers who could not cross the river took shelter on the other side of the river bank where there is a temple to Shiva. In the night, one of the brothers dreamed that Ashwathnaryana came and asked the brother to worship him so that he and his future generations would be benefited. The next day the brother was found on the other side of the river bank under the great sacred fig. From then on, the worship of Ashwathnaryana was done by this family only. History Vidurashwatha is known as the jalian wala bhag of south. 35 freedom fighters martyred while hoisting congress flag here. Nagaprathistha One of the most important ceremonies which is done in this place is Nagaprathista, it's done by the people who have sarpa dosha in their horoscope. Here the devotees come and pray to the lord asking for a specific boon (such as a child or for marriage). Once the boon is fulfilled, they perform a prathistha. Not all devotees need to do the same, only those devotees who had taken a vow in front of the lord need to do it. Nagaprathista when done under the fig tree is the most auspicious and fruitful for the devotees, as this fig tree is the oldest and most sacred, doing prasthita here is considered most beneficial. Adi Shankaracharya interprets this tree as representing the entire cosmos. 'Shwa' in Sanskrit means tomorrow. 'a' indicates negation, and 'tha' means one that stands or remains. He interprets Ashwatha to indicate \\"One which does not remain the same tomorrow\\", or the universe itself. The eternal life of the Ashwatha Tree has inspired many Indian philosophers and Hindu thought. Present The village has a temple and few Kalyanamandapa (marriage halls).

It produced both licensed retro games and current format video games, including the emulation code for C64 titles on Nintendo's Virtual Console service. Alten8 ceased trading in December 2010. History The company was formed by Paul Andrews after his involvement with the website Retro-Trader, which led him to be commissioned to gather retro game licenses for a plug-into-TV video game console using games such as Ant Attack (originally on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum). When this was never realised he formed Alten8 to make use of the gathered licenses and expanded its remit, gaining Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, Wii and Xbox 360 developer status. An initial GBA release, GT Racers, through another publisher convinced Alten8 to self-publish all titles where possible from that point onwards, or to develop console titles under contract only from major publishers, billing itself as the \\"Alten8 way of publishing games\\". Games Alten8 published over 500 licensed retro games across formats such as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amiga. Many mobile phone games were both developed and owned by Alten8, with other licensed PC and Nintendo DS games published across the globe, including the DS remake of the popular homebrew Dreamcast game, Cool Herders. As well as developing the code for several retro titles on the VC, Alten8 also worked with new pioneering mobile phone companies such as Greystripe and Vollee. Controversies In March 2006, Alten8 declared it would be publishing the mobile phone game Office Massacre. This led to a torrent of community and media backlash, with many people offended by the potentially gory and violent content. Bethesda Softworks founder Christopher Weaver even went to the lengths of name-calling Alten8 \\"... [a] bunch of idiots who don't understand the first thing about social responsibility\\". The game was quickly cancelled, with Alten8 stating \\"No offence ... was intended by this game, and we resent the comments made [and] the unfair and unjust comparison of this game to other extreme games.\\" Office Massacre re-appeared, some months later as a reskinned, censor-friendly Office Zombies, not too dis-similar to the controversy (and subsequent solution) surrounding Stainless Games' Carmageddon. In 2008, Alten8 came under fire inadvertently, after an independent contract designer Luc Bernard who had done a single phone game for Alten8 did an independent interview. Bernard's anti-holocaust-themed DS game ‚Äòconcept‚Äô was discussed, and then subsequently misdescribed by the press in an interview with the NY Times, Imagination Is The Only Escape, which was then immediately met with a media 'controversy' storm, with everyone from Destructoid who stated the concept was ‚Äúthe evolution of gaming, and the chance for videogames to tackle sensitive issues‚Äù to The New York Times itself having an distorted view on the interview they themselves carried out. But despite the initial press fuelled public confusion over the concept, an official quote from the Anti-Defamation League spokeswoman Myrna Shinbaum in which she appeared to actually endorse the game concept being made stating ‚ÄúWe certainly believe that we have to find new ways of teaching lessons of the Holocaust as new technologies are being developed‚Äú According to several erroneous internet sources, Nintendo themselves claimed that the game would never be released, however, this was confirmed to not be the case, and the game never went past the developers concept art. Imagination and its well-meant intentions by the developer was strongly backed by Alten8, but Alten8 itself had never known of its concept prior to the media storm, nor had any contract with the developer to produce it. Bernard went on to try to crowd fund and develop the game himself in 2013, but was unsuccessful. DVD Content As well as video games, Alten8 also licensed material for release on DVD, as well as publishing its own content. In particular, the Johnny Morris DVD, \\"The Magic Memoirs\\" is a poignant release, as it was the last recorded Animal Magic episode, and was co-hosted by Terry Nutkins. Expansion In 2008, Alten8 restructured its corporate layout to accommodate the many new staff and many new directions the company was heading in. Whilst the name of the company was the same, Alten8 itself was more of an umbrella term for the many studios underneath its banner, as well as the publishing brand for upcoming releases. Games development created with new IP were to be created by the Skull Monkey Games division, whilst Retro- Soft took care of the licensing and recreation of classic game brands owned by the company, such as the virtual console conversions and retro content for the iPhone.

It designates a style of paintings by Japanese artists made in accordance with Western (European) traditional conventions, techniques and materials.  History  European painting was introduced to Japan during the late Muromachi period along with Christian missionaries. Early religious works by Japanese artists in imitation of works brought by the missionaries can be considered some of the earliest forms of Y≈çga. However, the policy of national seclusion introduced by the Tokugawa bakufu in the Edo period effectively ended the influence of western art on Japanese painting, with the exception of the use of perspective, which was discovered by Japanese artists in sketches found in European medical and scientific texts imported from the Dutch via Nagasaki. In 1855, the Tokugawa bakufu established the Bansho Shirabesho, a translation and research institute for western studies, including a section to investigate western art. This section was headed by Kawakami T≈çgai, whose assistant Takahashi Yuichi was a student of English artist Charles Wirgman. Takahashi is regarded by many as the first true Y≈çga painter. In 1876, the Kobu Bijutsu Gakk≈ç (Technical Art School) was established by the Meiji government as Japan's first dedicated Y≈çga art school. Foreign advisors, such as the Italian artist Antonio Fontanesi, were hired by the government to teach Japanese artists, such as Asai Ch≈´ in the latest western techniques. In the 1880s, the general reaction against Westernization and the growth in popularity and strength of the Nihonga movement caused the temporary decline of Y≈çga. The Kobu Bijutsu Gakk≈ç was forced to close in 1883, and when the Tokyo Bijutsu Gakk≈ç (the forerunner of the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music) was established in 1887, only Nihonga subjects were taught. However, in 1889, the Meiji Bijutsukai (Meiji Fine Arts Society) was established by Y≈çga artists, and in 1893, the return of Kuroda Seiki from his studies in Europe gave fresh impetus to the Y≈çga genre, with the establishment of the Hakuba-kai (White Horse Society). From 1896, a Y≈çga department was added to the curriculum of the Tokyo Bijutsu Gakk≈ç, and from that point onwards, Y≈çga has been an accepted component of Japanese painting. Since that time, Y≈çga and Nihonga have been the two main divisions of modern Japanese painting. This division is reflected in education, the mounting of exhibitions, and the identification of artists. However, in many cases Nihonga artists also adopted realistic Western painting techniques, such as perspective and shading. Because of this tendency to synthesize, although Nihonga forms a distinct category within the Japanese annual Nitten exhibitions, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to draw a distinct separation in either techniques or materials between Nihonga and Y≈çga.  Materials  Y≈çga in its broadest sense encompasses oil painting, watercolors, pastels, ink sketches, lithography, etching and other techniques developed in western culture. However, in a more limited sense, Y≈çga is sometimes used specifically to refer to oil painting.

Part II\\" in Engineering Magazine 11. 1896 After the 1864 fire, the East Armory was rebuilt on its predecessor's foundation, to designs by General William B. Franklin, the company's general manager and a former U.S. Army engineer, and completed in 1867. It is a 5-story brick structure with brownstone accents, in dimensions, with its main entrance in the center of a five-bay pavilion projecting from the main facade. The building is capped with a distinctive onion-shaped, sheet metal dome, painted deep blue with gold stars, and resembling that of the 1855 armory. A gilded ball sits atop the dome, above which is a gilded fiberglass replica of the original \\"Rampant Colt\\". (Its gilded wood original is now on display at the Museum of Connecticut History at Connecticut State Library.)Museum of Connecticut History web site, retrieved 21 July 2008 Four Porter-Allen steam engines drove the armory's machine tools through a maze of shafts and belts. Mark Twain, who lived in the nearby Mark Twain House, visited Colt's armory in 1868 and described it thus: \\"It comprises a great range of tall brick buildings, and on every floor is a dense wilderness of strange iron machines‚Ä¶ a tangled forest of rods, bars, pulleys, wheels, and all the imaginable and unimaginable forms of mechanism‚Ä¶ It must have required more brains to invent all those things than would serve to stock 50 Senates like ours.\\" Today the factory complex includes: the Forge Shop and the Foundry (from the original 1855 factory); the East Armory with its distinctive blue onion dome, rebuilt in 1867; the South and North Armories (1921), the Machine Shop, Warehouse, Power Plant, and Garage, built in 1916 to accommodate World War I production; and the World War II Office Building (1942). The state of Connecticut has been trying to place the complex under the administration of the National Park Service as a National Historical Park, similar to designation granted the Lowell National Historical Park, another important site in the history of American industrialism. In 1994, Colt's Manufacturing Company vacated the Hartford complex amid financial difficulties, consolidating operations at a West Hartford, CT location opened in the 1960s. A former tenant in the East Armory, U.S. Fire Arms Manufacturing Company, originally manufactured replicas of historic Colt pistols, before diversifying and discontinuing the replicas. Colt's Armory Printing Press In addition to Colt firearms, the factory produced a number of items under contract for other companies. The most famous of these was a letterpress printing press designed by Merrit Gally, known as the Universal. From 1873 to 1902, the Armory manufactured a series of these presses that developed a reputation as the finest hand-fed platen press ever made (a reputation which survives to the present). These presses eventually became known generically as \\"Colt's Armory\\" presses, although they were distributed under names including Colt's Armory, Universal, Victoria, Hartford, National and Laureate. The fascinating history of the design, production, sales and business battles behind these storied presses was summarized in a 1983 article in the typographic journal Type & Press.The Great Colt's Armory War in Type & Press See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford, Connecticut Notes References * Charles Louis Flint, One Hundred Years' Progress of the United States, L.

The division was formed in 1918, initially as the 2nd Penza Infantry Division. After becoming the 5th Rifle Division a month later, it fought in the Counteroffensive of Eastern Front in spring 1919 and later operations in Siberia. In the spring of 1920, the division was relocated west and fought in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, participating in the Battle of Warsaw. The division was awarded the Honorary Revolutionary Red Banner for its actions during the wars in 1929. In September 1939, it fought in the Soviet invasion of Poland and was then sent to Lithuania under the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty. After Operation Barbarossa, the division fought in the Baltic Operation and the Leningrad Strategic Defensive. During the winter of 1941-1942, it participated in the Battle of Moscow, fighting in the Kalinin (Tver) area. During the summer of 1942, the division fought in the Rzhev- Vyazma Offensive and became the 44th Guards Rifle Division for its actions there on 5 October. Just more than a week later, the 5th Rifle Division was reformed from a rifle brigade in the Moscow Military District. In February 1943, the division fought in offensives in the Mtsensk and Tver areas. In July, it fought in Operation Kutuzov and was awarded the honorific \\"Orel\\" after it captured the city on 4 August. Between September and October, it fought in the Bryansk Offensive. It continued to advance and participated in the Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive and reached the Dnieper before it went on the defensive in early December. In February 1944, the division fought in the Rogachev-Zhlobin Offensive and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its actions. From June 1944, the division fought in Operation Bagration, It was awarded the Order of Suvorov 2nd class for breaking through German defenses on the Drut River. It the fought in the Minsk Offensive and Belostock Offensive. For its capture of Vawkavysk on 14 July, the division received the Order of Kutuzov 2nd class. The division continued its advance and reached the Narew in August. From then until November, it fought in the battle for the Narew bridgeheads. In 1945, the division fought in the Mlawa-Elbing Offensive and the Berlin Offensive. It was awarded the Order of Lenin for its actions. The division was disbanded in June 1946.  History  = First formation = The division was initially formed in September 1918 as the 2nd Penza Infantry Division. It was later renamed as the 5th Rifle Division (October 1918), Saratov (1920), Vitebsk (1921), and 'in the name of the Czechoslovak Proletariat' (1925). For successful operations during the Russian Civil War it was awarded the Honourable Revolutionary Red Banner in 1929. In August 1939 it was deployed to the Belorussian Special Military District. On September 17, 1939, the Division was assigned to the 4th Rifle Corps, Third Army of the Belorussian Front. On October 2, 1939, the Division was reassigned to the 10th Rifle Corps, Third Army of the Belorussian Front. In September‚ÄìOctober 1939 it took part in the Soviet invasion of Poland. From October 1939 it was deployed in Lithuania according to the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty. Since July 1940 it was stationed in the Baltic Military District. During the Second World War, the Division was part of the Eleventh Army (where it was part of 16th Rifle Corps at the outbreak of the war), 27th Army, Soviet First Guards Army and 65th Army. As of October 1, 1941, the Division was a part of the 31st Army of the Soviet Reserve Front. The Division participated in defensive fights on as part of the Soviet Western Front, in Moscow and at the Battle of Stalingrad, in fights for Donbass and clearing of Left-bank Ukraine, in the Gomel-Rechitsa, Belarus, Mlawo-Elbing, East Pomerania and the Berlin offensive operations. For its service in battle the Division became the 44th Guards Rifle Division on October 5, 1942.

Background The term \\"soft laser desorption\\" has not been widely used by the mass spectrometry community, which in most cases uses matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) to indicate soft laser desorption ionization that is aided by a separate matrix compound. The term soft laser desorption was used most notably by the Nobel Foundation in public information released in conjunction with the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Koichi Tanaka was awarded 1/4 of the prize for his use of a mixture of cobalt nanoparticles and glycerol in what he called the ‚Äúultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method‚Äù of laser desorption ionization. With this approach, he was able to demonstrate the soft ionization of proteins. The MALDI technique was demonstrated (and the name coined) in 1985 by Michael Karas, Doris Bachmann, and Franz Hillenkamp, but ionization of proteins by MALDI was not reported until 1988, immediately after Tanaka's results were reported. Some have argued that Karas and Hillenkamp were more deserving of the Nobel Prize than Tanaka because their crystalline matrix method is much more widely used than Tanaka's liquid matrix. Countering this argument is the fact that Tanaka was the first to use a 337 nm nitrogen laser while Karas and Hillenkamp were using a 266 nm Nd:YAG laser. The \\"modern\\" MALDI approach came into being several years after the first soft laser desorption of proteins was demonstrated. The term soft laser desorption is now used to refer to MALDI as well as \\"matrix free\\" methods for laser desorption ionization with minimal fragmentation. Variants =Graphite= The surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization (SALDI) approach uses a liquid plus graphite particle matrix. A colloidal graphite matrix has been called \\"GALDI\\" for colloidal graphite-assisted laser desorption/ionization. =Nanostructured surfaces= The desorption ionization on silicon (DIOS) approach is laser desorption/ionization of a sample deposited on a porous silicon surface. Nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS) is a variant of DIOS that uses \\"initiator\\" molecules trapped in the nanostructures. Although nanostructures are typically formed by etching, laser etching can also be used, for example as in laser-induced silicon microcolumn arrays (LISMA) for matrix-free mass spectrometry analysis. =Nanowires= A commercial NALDI target Silicon nanowires were initially developed as a DIOS-MS application. This approach was later commercialized as Nanowire-assisted laser desorption/ionization (NALDI) uses a target consisting of nanowires made from metal oxides or nitrides. NALDI targets are available from Bruker Daltonics (although they are marketed as \\"nanostructured\\" rather than \\"nanowire\\" targets). =Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI)= The surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) variant is similar to MALDI, but uses a biochemical affinity target. The technique known as surface-enhanced neat desorption (SEND) is a related variant of MALDI with the matrix is covalently linked to the target surface. The SELDI technology was commercialized by Ciphergen Biosystems in 1997 as the ProteinChip system. It is now produced and marketed by Bio-Rad Laboratories. =Other methods= The technique known as laser induced acoustic desorption (LIAD) is transmission geometry LDI with a metal film target.

Vocalist Soichiro \\"Ume\\" Umemura died in 2007 after nearly twenty years fronting the band. Tokyo Yankees however continue to perform with the other members sharing vocals. History =Beginning and success= Tokyo Yankees formed in 1988 and began playing shows in the local club scene the following year. Umemura and Nori were previously in the heavy metal band Guerilla, while U.D.A. and Ami were in the speed/thrash metal band Rommel. Rockin 'f, a Japanese heavy metal publication, issued their first single, \\"Joker\\", with an issue of their magazine in 1990. That same year their song \\"Rat Race\\" was issued on an omnibus album titled The End of the Century Rockers Emergency Express II. The band eventually signed with Extasy Records, who released their debut album, Do The Dirty, in 1991. That year they participated in Extasy Records' Extasy Summit '91 at the Nippon Budokan to a crowd of 14,000. The band released another record, Overdoing, on Extasy in 1992. The band's popularity peaked at that point, gaining them a contract with major label Nippon Columbia, where they released two albums; 1993's Ghost Rider and 1994's Vacate Your Useless Brain. The band's popularity declined afterwards, and they returned to the indies scene in 1995. Ami and U.D.A left after the band returned to the indies scene. Yoshinuma (ex. Grimm the Capsule) replaced Ami in 1996, and Yamato replaced U.D.A. Ricky replaced Yamato after their 1996 tour. After Tokyo Yankees, Ami went on to form Charisma, who released three albums between 1997 and 2000. A Tokyo Yankees compilation LP was issued from Nippon Columbia in 1996. The band continued to perform in the local club circuits, and participated in V/A releases. After U.D.A returned in 2000, the band released Pre-Emptive Strike in 2003. A year later they issued 777, their second EP. It features covers of influential bands (The Damned, Black Sabbath, Venom, and Anthrax) and well as re- recordings of two classic Yankees tracks; \\"Dirty Dog\\" and \\"Devil\\". =Recent Activity= Vocalist Soichiro \\"Ume\\" Umemura died on December 11, 2007. The band decided to continued on, with Yoshi and Nori taking over vocal duties. One of the band's first shows following Ume's death was the \\"hide memorial summit\\" in May 2008, where they performed with Extasy Records alumni X Japan and Luna Sea. On May 4, 2008, Tokyo Yankees performed at the hide memorial summit at the 50,000 seat Ajinomoto Stadium, giving the group the opportunity to play for a large audience. Later that month, the band was featured on 413Tracks' Mot√∂rhead Tribute album with a recording of \\"Ace of Spades\\" and a live rendition of \\"Overkill\\". July saw the release a history DVD chronicling Tokyo Yankees career, and celebrating their 20th anniversary titled 20 and Alive [We Are The Yankees Of The Underworld And We're Undead!], which Yankee's supported with a small tour. Nori, Yoshi and U.D.A continue to perform as Tokyo Yankees and gig in the greater Tokyo area, and around Japan. Recent videos posted on Facebook and YouTube show the band sometimes performing with guest vocalists. The band also has maintained a friendly relationship with former members Ami and Tohda, both of whom occasionally join the band on stage. Sometimes they play entire shows with Ami on bass and Tohda on guitar (the former being somewhat more frequent), in which case Yoshinuma takes over full-time on vocals for the performance. In September 2012, they performed alongside Ra:IN, Der Zibet and Ladies Room at the Yokohama Summer Rock Fes. ‚Äì Revolution Rocks 2012. In 2015, Tokyo Yankees joined several other well known Japanese rock bands, including X JAPAN, Luna Sea, Buck-Tick, and Dir en grey, to play at Luna Sea's rock festival LUNATIC FEST, in Tokyo, Japan. Since 2003 Nori has been active in his side-band From Hell, they have released two EP's and play one or two shows a month. Yoshi also plays in his side-band Blotto Rockers once a month. Occasionally when Nori plays with Kabukichou Boys and Yoshi with Go Bands, both bands use the name Fake And Liar.

Character's background  Alexx Woods, originally from Los Angeles, California, is a medical examiner who worked for the Miami-Dade Police department for six seasons on the show. She is married with two children and is always upbeat and has a good bedside manner with her patients, despite being a coroner. Alexx has a tendency, displayed in many episodes, to talk to the corpses she is examining. She often addresses the corpses as \\"sweetie\\", \\"honey\\", or \\"baby boy/girl\\" in a maternal way, and she often comments that the victims were too young to die. It is nearly her mantra. She is also like a maternal figure to her colleagues, especially to Ryan and Eric when they were injured. She has two children, a son Bryan and a daughter Jamie. She's also married, her husband's name is Henry.  Major events leading up to Alexx leaving CSI  As mentioned above, Alexx addresses the corpses in a maternal way. She is also seen addressing her own children in a very natural maternal way when talking about \\"bad people\\" to them after a case involving a child (episode 106, \\"Broken\\"). At the beginning of Episode 214, \\"Slow Burn\\", Alexx has a near death encounter when she is collecting a body from a crime scene when a seemingly controlled fire in the Everglades becomes out of hand and nearly burns her to death.

Alexx is shaken up and talks with Horatio about not wanting to end up like the bodies on her table. Alexx also hosts groups from alcohol treatment programs, showing them the consequences (i.e., dead bodies) of drunk driving. One of the participants, a young former Navy corpsman, asks her for a job, and Alexx agrees to a one-week trial. When a flask belonging to one of the corpses disappears, she suspects the young man stole it. However, Alexx later discovers that it was in fact one of her fellow medical examiners, Dr. Glen Monroe, who purloined it, saying that the dead man wouldn't miss it. Alexx informs Dr. Monroe that if he does not report himself to the chief medical examiner, she would. Not long after, Dr. Monroe in a drunken stupor kills himself and a teenager when he gets in a car accident, and Alexx shows his body to the next group of alcohol treatment members, bitterly reminding them not only of the cost of their behavior to others but to themselves, as well (episode 311, \\"Addiction\\"). In episode 316, \\"Nothing To Lose,\\" Alexx is held hostage by serial killer, Kendrick, and forced to dress his gunshot wound. While being held hostage, Kendrick made repeated threats towards her children. She is eventually rescued by Horatio Caine. Kendrick flees capture into an Everglades wildfire. His body is later identified by Alexx when she recognizes her own handiwork over his gunshot wound. She has a close relationship with Horatio Caine and his team of CSIs from the lab, and considers them an extension of her family. This has led to friction in the autopsy room from her fellow MEs as well as her boss, who at one point tells her to transfer to night shift if she wishes to have any future promotions. Alexx is very maternal by nature and looks out for her co-workers as though they were her children. This is evident in season 4 of the show when she continues to care for and worry about Ryan Wolfe after he is injured by a nail gun. She gives him a name of an eye doctor after she believes his experiencing vision troubles may be due to an infection resulting from the trauma (episode 410, \\"Shattered\\"). She is superficially injured when a rocket is launched at the courthouse where she is preparing to give testimony. Alexx immediately begins to treat the wounded while the police attempt to discover the reason for the attack (episode 514, \\"No Man's Land\\"). When Eric Delko is shot in the head not long afterwards, she and her colleagues at the crime lab express great concern over his well-being. Alexx is the first to point out that because of the nature of the injury, Delko, if he should recover, might not be the same person they knew before (episode 515, \\"Man Down\\"). She has had to autopsy several people she knew, including CSI Tim Speedle (episode 301, \\"Lost Son\\") and Officer Aaron Jessop (episode 425, \\"One of Our Own\\"). Alexx is also horrified when her best friend's husband ends up on her table. And far from his being the victim of a random shooting, he was targeted by his wife's young lover at her instruction. Despite equivocal evidence and being taken off of the case, Alexx believes her best friend guilty of setting up her husband's murder (episode 123, \\"Freaks and Tweaks\\"). A coroner's report from another M.E. also gains her attention as she delivers it to Calleigh, but gets around reading it by saying that she can read upside down. After much contemplation, Alexx decides that she is going to leave CSI. In the episode Going Ballistic, her replacement, Shannon Higgins (Alison McAtee), arrives at a crime scene and was murdered a short time later. Alexx officially resigns from her post in episode 619, \\"Rock and a Hard Place.\\" Her son Brian had nearly got himself into deep trouble for associating with juvenile delinquents and she realized that she has to spend more time with him. She tells Horatio that \\"I need to spend more of my time taking care of the living.\\" Horatio replies saying the position of medical examiner \\"will always be open\\" for her. Alexx then bids farewell to the rest of the team.  Guest reappearances  Woods is seen in Episode 714, \\"Smoke Gets in Your CSI's\\", running out of a hospital's emergency room to the ambulance where an unconscious CSI Calleigh Duquesne is on a stretcher. She accompanies her into the emergency room and is seen fighting for Calleigh's life. At the end of the episode, she is seen talking to Horatio and invites him to family night at her house with her family. She returned for the eighth-season premiere of the show, in a flashback episode. She also was at the hospital where Eric was being treated and returned again for the episode \\"Bad Seed\\".

It was based at Tachikawa, in Tokyo Prefecture. History =Tachikawa Aircraft= In November 1924, Ishikawajima Shipyards (the future IHI Corporation) established a subsidiary company, the . In 1936, the Imperial Japanese Army acquired a controlling interest in the company, and renamed it the Tachikawa Aircraft Company Ltd. The company manufactured a number of types, mostly training aircraft and fighters for the Imperial Japanese Army. Some were its own designs placed into full production, such as the Ki-9 and Ki-36. A number of others were either short-run specials, or prototypes that did not enter production, such as the Ki-77. In 1940, the company received license-production rights to the Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra which it produced as the Army Type LO transport. Tachikawa also produced aircraft designed by other Japanese manufacturers. As with all Japanese manufacturers, production of all types ceased after the surrender of Japan to Allied forces in August 1945. The facilities of Tachikawa Aircraft had been severely damaged by bombing during the war, and most of its property, including its airfield, were seized by the American military and become part of the Tachikawa Air Base. Many of its engineers went to work for Nissan and Toyota, helping develop the technologies of the Japanese automobile industry. The Prince Motor Company (later acquired by Nissan) was a direct spin-out from the former Tachikawa Aircraft Company.Tama Electric Vehicle E4S-47 (JSAE Official Website) =New Tachikawa Aircraft Company = During the occupation of Japan after the end of World War II, all of Japan's aerospace industry was dismantled, designs destroyed and plants converted to other uses. After the ban on aircraft development was lifted in November 1949, Tachikawa Aircraft was reconstituted as the . Shin Tachikawa built prototype training aircraft, the R-52 and R-53 in the early 1950s. The R-52 was the first post-war, all-Japanese aircraft constructed. However, neither aircraft were commercially successful and the company survived by making precision components for aircraft, and for non-aircraft related industries. In 1955, the company name was changed to to emphasize its lack of involvement with the aviation industry. Since 1976, after the return of a large amount of land occupied by the United States Air Force since the end of World War II, the company turned towards real estate development, consumer electronics, and the production of automotive parts.

It was the only significant right-wing conservative political party in the late 1940s. Key elements in this program were enacted, including the exclusion of the Communist Party from power, closer relations with the United States, and amnesty for Marshal Philippe P√©tain's supporters. It was absorbed by the National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNI) in 1951.Vinen, 1993, The PRL's aim was to unite French conservatives, who had been totally discredited in 1944 due to the numbers of Vichy collaborators in their ranks, and the role they played during the interwar period.

An upper tangent arc seen over the setting Sun, Santa Rosa Beach, Florida November 24th, 2015. halo display observed over the South Pole. Featured in the photo are several distinct phenomena: A parhelic circle (horizontal line), a 22¬∞ halo (circle) with a sundog (bright spot), and an upper tangent arc. Photo: Cindy McFee, NOAA, December 1980. Tangent arcs are a type of halo, an atmospheric optical phenomenon, which appear above and below the observed Sun or Moon, tangent to the 22¬∞ halo. To produce these arcs, rod-shaped hexagonal ice crystals need to have their long axis aligned horizontally.  Description  = Upper arc = The shape of an upper tangent arc varies with the elevation of the Sun; while the Sun is low (less than 29‚Äì32¬∞) it appears as an arc over the observed Sun forming a sharp angle. As the Sun is seen to rise above the Earth's horizon, the curved wings of the arc lower towards the 22¬∞ halo while gradually becoming longer. As the Sun rises over 29‚Äì32¬∞, the upper tangent arc unites with the lower tangent arc to form the circumscribed halo. = Lower arc = The lower tangent arc is rarely observable, appearing under and tangent to a 22¬∞ halo centred on the Sun. Just like upper tangent arcs, the shape of a lower arc is dependent on the altitude of the Sun. As the Sun is observed slipping over Earth's horizon the lower tangent arc forms a sharp, wing-shaped angle below the Sun. As the Sun rises over Earth's horizon, the arc first folds upon itself and then takes the shape of a wide arc. As the Sun reaches 29-32¬∞ over the horizon, it finally begins to widen and merge with the upper tangent arc to form the circumscribed halo. Since by definition, the Sun elevation must exceed 22¬∞ above the horizon, most observations are from elevated observation points such as mountains and planes.  Origin  Both the upper and lower tangent arc form when hexagonal rod-shaped ice crystals in cirrus clouds have their long axis oriented horizontally. Each crystal can have its long axis oriented in a different horizontal direction, and can rotate around the long axis. Such a crystal configuration also produces other halos, including 22¬∞ halos and sun dogs; a predominant horizontal orientation is required to produce a crisp upper tangent arc. Like all colored halos, tangent arcs grade from red towards the Sun (i.e., downwards) to blue away from it, because red light is refracted less strongly than blue light.

Lannes was born in Los Angeles, California where her father did financial management for small production companies formed by actors in the entertainment industry. Her early horror fiction often explored family relationships and abuse, and its frequently graphic nature led to Lannes's early involvement in the Splatterpunk movement. Her story \\"Goodbye Dark Love\\" is considered a classic in the genre, and her work also paved the way for later female writers of horror fiction.

The play had a successful Broadway run in 1961 and was broadcast on NBC in 1971 as a Hallmark Hall of Fame special. The story Chayefsky drew from three chapters in the Book of Judges in writing this play, which explores the relationship of an ordinary man to God. \\"The Angel of the Lord\\" appears before Gideon and drafts him to perform one of God's miracles. Gideon is to save his people from idolatry by winning an impossible battle in which 300 Israelites will defeat 120,000 Midianites. In the second act, which a Time magazine review described as the weaker of the play's two acts, Gideon asks to be released from his \\"covenant of love\\" with God. Gideon ignores God's order to kill some idolatrous Hebrew tribal chiefs, one of whom has a daughter who performs a seductive dance. Gideon tells God, \\"You are too vast a concept for me.\\" Gideon explains that his pity for fellow humans is above God's law. The Lord acknowledges that man wants to be \\"a proper god. You know, he might some day.\\" The cast In the original Broadway version, Gideon was played by Douglas Campbell and Fredric March played \\"The Angel of the Lord.\\" In the television adaptation, Peter Ustinov played Gideon and Jos√© Ferrer played \\"The Angel of the Lord.\\" The Time reviewer described Campbell's portrayal of Gideon in the 1961 production as \\"a simple-minded oaf one minute and a Judaic Henry V the next.\\" TV Guide noted that Ustinov played Gideon as \\"a lumbering Hebrew\\" in the NBC adaptation. Reception Gideon was a critical success. A highly positive review appeared in the Chicago Tribune, where it was written that Chayefsky \\"has a knack for looking into the lives and personalities of common people and finding humor, pathos and even greatness.\\" John J. O'Connor conversely stated, \\"Neither very deep nor especially sweeping, 'Gideon' is a modest achievement, but its very modesty can be charming.\\" Television adaptation The 90-minute Hallmark Hall of Fame adaptation on NBC aired in the United States on Friday, March 26, 1971 at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time. It pre-empted Name of the Game. Chayefsky's Broadway script was adapted for television by Robert Hartung. George Schaefer produced and directed the TV version. =Closed-circuit experiment= Four performances of the play were transmitted over telephone lines from the stage of the Plymouth Theatre to a screen in the Auditorium Theater in Rochester, New York, in March 1962 to test closed-circuit television.

It runs one of the largest private network of schools in India, operating 12,000 schools with over 32,00,000 students, as of 2016 and has its registered headquarters in Lucknow with a functional headquarters in Delhi and a sub-office in Kurukshetra. Contributing to the Indic education.  History  RSS, under the tutelage of M. S. Golwalkar established its first Gita school at Kurukshetra in 1946. But, the ban on RSS in 1948 put a damper on the spread of the Gita school model. After the ban was lifted, the first Saraswati Shishu Mandir brand school was established in Gorakhpur in 1952, by Nanaji Deshmukh. The Saraswati Shishu Mandir model was quickly replicated across several locations and as the number of schools increased, there arose the need of a definite management structure. Accordingly, Shishu Shiksha Prabandak Samiti, was set up to coordinate activities between these schools at the state level. Such committees were set up in Delhi, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. In 1977-78, an all-India apex body, Vidya Bharati was set up to coordinate the activities between these state committees and was headquartered in Delhi. This coincided with the Bharatiya Jan Sangh (political arm of RSS) winning the national elections, as a member of the Janata Party. Incidentally, Vidya Bharati used to have an associated National Academic Council with educationists, which enjoyed the trust of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).  Organisation  By the early 1990s, the network had grown to 5,000 schools and by 2003, to about 14,000 schools with 1.7 million pupils. This expansion was facilitated by the growing demand for education in India and the disaffection with the state school system. As of March 2002, it had 17,396 schools, 2.2 million students, over 93,000 teachers, 15 teacher training colleges, 12 degree colleges and 7 vocational and training institutions. Most of the Vidya Bharati schools are affiliated to the Central Board for Secondary Education or their local State Boards. Vidya Bharati-run educational programs were adopted in Madhya Pradesh as an alternate model of education when BJP was in power. In addition to formal schools (which go by a variety of names such as ', ', ', ' etc.), Vidya Bharati also runs sanskar kendras (cultural schools) and single-teacher schools for cultural education. It controls over 250 intermediate colleges and about 25 institutions of higher education and training colleges. = Presence = It has schools in remote areas of the north-eastern states as well as states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu where RSS does not have much influence. Particular attention is given to underdeveloped regions and regions inhabited by tribal communities. The chain has over 29 state and regional committees affiliated to it, making it the largest voluntary association in India. = Funding and patronage = Funds for this expansion have been collected through various means, including charities across the world. According to Awaaz, a London-based organisation, a significant portion of the Sewa International earthquake funds for Gujarat have been used to build RSS schools. The network also benefited from favourable allotment of land by Jana Sangh and BJP politicians. It was also helped with miscellaneous patronage by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) whenever it was in power in the states or in the Centre (1999-2004). Nanaji Deshmukh believed that the movement had turned 'materialistic', during the later phases but was not paying enough attention to recruiting high-quality teachers. The schools attract the children of urban and small-town shopkeepers and those of professional and government official families. Ideology and Objectives Dinanath Batra, former General Secretary of Vidya Bharati, said that they were fighting an \\"ideological battle against Macaulay, Marx and Madrasawadis\\". In comparison to which Vidya Bharati advocates \\"Indianization, nationalization and spiritualization\\" of education. In the areas of study that are peripheral to the core curriculum, like physical education, music and cultural education, the institution worked out its own curriculum.  Cultural education  Wherever they are asked to use the standard NCERT textbooks, Vidya Bharati schools supplement them with their own books which emphasize the Hindutva ideology. They blame the \`internal disunity' of Hindus for the invasions of Turks, Mongols and Mughals. Christian pastors are described as instruments of colonialism. The Hindu divinities and historical Hindu heroes are listed along with RSS founders Hedgewar and Golwalkar. In addition to the prescribed curriculum, the Vidya Bharati schools teach five extra subjects: moral education, which includes stories of heroes, songs, honesty, and personal hygiene, physical education, which includes learning to wield a stick, martial arts and yoga, music, Sanskrit and Vedic mathematics. Girls are given kanya bharati sessions where they discuss the real-world problems especially \\"women-centric\\" sensitive issues and learn how to deal with them. They are trained to become strong leaders idolizing Queen of Jhansi Lakshmibai, Sarojini Naidu, and other successful women in various fields like Kalpana Chawla, Sunita Williams, Kiran Bedi, etc. In the morning assembly, the children are taught to sing prayers and songs steeped in religious devotion and the spirit of patriotism. Assemblies and stage performances organized on Hindu festivals also serve to convey the Hindutva ideology. The virtual absence of non-Hindu children in the schools leads to a collective sense of Hindu identity. In the words of a Vidya Bharati commentator \\"dedication to the motherland with a deep Bharatiya spirit inculcates in the child the will to change his character [and] adjust his nature and programme so as to fulfill the nation's will and necessity.\\" The schools also use the students as conduits for spreading RSS ideology. The teachers go to students' houses to tell the parents about their children's performance and current activities in the schools. Children are asked to take home pamphlets about RSS and VHP activities to their parents. Promising students and volunteers are sent to RSS summer camps for further ideological training.

These branches focus on agriculture, healthcare, child education, and sports. It also works to create cultural awareness among janjatis thereby facilitating the idea of preservation of their tradition and customs followed in different groups. The organization is a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, the family of organisations affiliated with the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). History Folk dance by tribal at Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram function The Ashram was founded in 1952 by Ramakant Keshav Deshpande (also known as Balasaheb Deshpande), an official of the Orissa State Department of Tribal Welfare, with the support of the State Government and the RSS. After Independence, Balasaheb was appointed by the then Ravi Shankar Shukla Government to work in tribal-dominated Jashpur area as ‚ÄòRegional Officer‚Äô of the ‚ÄòTribal Development Scheme‚Äô. This particular area had gone into the iron grip of the Christian missionaries who had converted the simple tribal people to their religion by using all means fair and foul. Their conversion to Christianity had alienated them from the cultural and national moorings. Its aim was to counter the appeal of Christian missionary schools to the tribals. Based in Jashpur (214 km from Raigarh), it established schools in Raigarh and Surguja districts - areas with large tribal populations. The Ashram grew rapidly and a permanent office was established in 1963, inaugurated by the RSS chief M. S. Golwalkar. In 1977, during the Janata Party Government, it acquired national status (expressed in its new name, BhƒÅratiya VanavƒÅsi KalyƒÅn ƒÄshram). From 1978 to 1983, the number of its full-time volunteers rose from 44 to 264 (56 of whom were tribal). In Jashpur, a hospital was established, and schools, hotels, and centers for an apprenticeship in manual trades were also established in 40 villages. The programs are presently located in 312 districts throughout the country and are supervised by more than a thousand full-time workers. While most districts have primary schools, many other places have residential schools, hostels, libraries, and health centers. Important annual events include establishing medical camps, playing traditional sports, and celebrating tribal festivals.

He served as the first Bishop of Fall River from 1904 until his death in 1907. Biography William Stang was born at Langenbr√ºcken in the Grand Duchy of Baden, Germany. He received his early education at the local gymnasium and then attended the minor seminary of Sint-Niklaas in Belgium. He entered the American College of Louvain in 1875, where he completed his theological studies. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 15, 1878. Stang briefly taught at the Catholic University of Leuven before coming to the United States in September 1878 to work in the Diocese of Providence, Rhode Island. He primarily ministered to the local German Catholic community while also serving as a curate at the Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul in Providence. He was named pastor of St. Anne's Church in Cranston in 1884. He then served as rector of Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral until 1895, when he returned to the Catholic University of Leuven to serve as vice-rector and professor of moral theology. He returned to Providence in 1899, becoming head of the diocesan mission band. He was named pastor of St. Edward's Church in 1901 and also served as chancellor of the diocese. On March 12, 1904, Stang was appointed the first Bishop of the newly created Diocese of Fall River, Massachusetts, by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following May 1 from Bishop Matthew Harkins, with Bishops Michael Tierney and John Brady serving as co-consecrators, at Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral. During his tenure, he established eleven parishes and founded St. Anne's Hospital. He once described divorce as a \\"pernicious practice...contrary to the moral order and the law of Christ,\\" and condemned Saturday dances as \\"a source of scandal [that] must be stopped at once.\\" Stang died at St. Mary's Hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, at age 52.

Outside Japan, Aimachi is most known for its marching music and color guard ensembles. A selection from their 130-member marching band compete internationally as an indoor percussion ensembles, indoor marching ensembles, baton twirling, and winter guards. The group rehearses outside of Nagoya in Handa City. Aimachi Band The Aimachi Band was started in 1962 with four members. The founder of the band, Kiyokazu Sekine, is the son of Aimachi's founder and continues to serve as the group's director. In 1998, the Aimachi marching band became the All-Japan National Champion in the All-Japan Marching and Baton Twirling championships for the first time in their history. They have gone on to win in January 1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2007, December 2008, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018, and performing in exhibition in December 2007 and 2010. They also won the 2002 WAMSB World Championship for Marching Showbands in Chiba, Japan. Since 1990, Americans on Aimachi's instructional and design staff have included Gordon Henderson (Band Director), Mitch Rogers, Michael Gaines, Jim Campbell, Tim Fairbanks, Erik Johnson, Scott Kretzer, Brett Kuhn, Jim Moore, Martin Rhees, Dean Westman, William Plenk, Christian Carichner, Stephen Mason, Aidan Ritchie and Kevin LeBoeuf. In July 2011, the Aimachi Band traveled to Switzerland to perform at the Basel Tattoo. In May 2012, the Aimachi Band celebrated its 50th anniversary with a show performed at the Nagoya Century Hall entitled \\"Evolution.\\" Other international performances have included those in Thailand, Taiwan and Shanghai. Indoor percussion This group performs in many competitions across Japan, the Winter Guard International championships, and other exhibition performances throughout Asia. At WGI Percussion, they placed 3rd in 2000, 2006 and 2008 in the Independent World Division. A group celebrating their cultural origins, they deviate from conventional battery percussion by adding taiko drums, shime-daiko drums, and the odaiko drum to a traditionally western activity. They add many elements from their award- winning Winter Guard into their performances, including flags, rifles, sabres, batons, and dance sections to offer a visual package unique in the percussion circuit.

History ;Introduction From its beginnings as a small jazz band called the Merry Young Man Band, the Aimachi Band has become one of the best-known marching bands around the world. The Band's founder was Sekine Kiyokazu, who continues in the role of director to this day. The foundations from where the Band developed from are closely tied to the introduction of the Tenri religion to the Nagoya area by Sekine Kiyokazu's father, Sekine Toyomatsu. The elder Sekine moved to Tokoname outside of Nagoya in 1923 to visit families in the area that were interested in the Tenri religion. In 1926, he moved into Nagoya and began holding services in a small rented house. In 1930, as the church began to grow, he moved into another small house on the grounds of what is now the main Aimachi Church in Nagoya. ;Sekine Kiyokazu Early Years On January 23, 1943, Sekine Kiyokazu was born in Nagoya. Sekine was exposed to music at a very young age. His father was a strong proponent of introducing traditional Japanese music into the Tenri church services. His father also really enjoyed attending kabuki performances, and his mother's family was involved in building traditional Japanese instruments used in the performances. So music was all around the young Kiyokazu from the very beginning. As an elementary school student, Sekine's music teacher, Mr. Watanabe, taught him singing and how to play the xylophone. Influenced by one of his friends who played marimba, Sekine later attended an after school program, taught by Suiho Yoshikawa, that specialized in teaching students to play the marimba. In 1952, at the age of nine, Sekine entered a xylophone contest that was broadcast live on a local radio station. His third-place finish in the contest encouraged him to continue his study of music. One of the experiences that made a strong impression on Sekine was a display by the local fire department. In addition to a dazzling water demonstration by the fireman, they also had a band that performed and started to make Sekine think that he would like to lead a band someday. ;Aimachi Band Beginnings The Aimachi Band came into existence at a time following World War II that Japanese culture was greatly influenced by the presence of American military bases throughout the country. All things American, whether it be sports (baseball, which had first been introduced to Japan in 1872, had a surge of popularity following the war), movies or music, became very popular throughout Japan. American military bases all had radio stations broadcasting music such as jazz, American popular music, and band music. Following World War II, the Tenri religion in Nagoya quickly grew in membership, and in 1955, the present day Aimachi Church was built. In addition to religious services, the Church began to offer a variety of clubs for activities such as singing, karate and other sports. In 1962, as a 19-year-old Aichi University student studying law, Sekine Kiyokatsu became the director of all of these activities for the Aimachi Church. It was at this time that Sekine formed the Merry Young Man Band, a small combo that played jazz and popular music. The name arose from one of the beliefs of the Church that being happy, or merry, is a very important aspect of a person's life. The success of the Merry Young Man Band led Mr. Sekine to want to organize a concert band. After talking to Aimachi Church members about it, they donated enough money for Sekine to purchase 15 instruments. The only problem was that he didn‚Äôt have anyone who could play these concert band instruments. About the same time, he met Mr. Nagasaka who had played in the band at Meiden High School in Nagoya, and who wished to continue playing, but he didn‚Äôt have his own instrument or a group to play in. Mr. Nagasaka told Mr. Sekine that he had 14 friends who were graduates of Meiden High School that also wanted to play in a band. So these 15 Meiden High School graduates, none of whom belonged to the Tenri religion, started coming to the Aimachi Church to play in a band conducted by Mr. Sekine. When this band performed, it would sometimes be known as the Meiden High School Alumni Band and at other times as the Aimachi Church band. As the band progressed over the next year, most of the Meiden High School alumni continued to play and Aimachi Church members started to join. By October 1963, the band purchased its first set of uniforms for the group that included 13 Meiden alumni and six Aimachi Church members as well as baton twirlers. The Meiden alumni began giving music lessons to many of the young members of the Aimachi Church as more and more church members joined the Band. The Band was soon involved in marching in local parades in addition to the concert performances. ;International Influences Genkichi Harada, who had served as a tuba player in the famed NHK Orchestra, conducted numerous clinics around Japan about band music. Sekine attended one of these clinics and the two soon became friends. As a member of the NHK Orchestra, Mr. Harada had made several world tours and knew many prominent musicians around the world whom he would often visit later on his own. Sekine accompanied Harada on one of these trips to London to visit Harry Mortimer, a famous English composer and conductor of brass bands, and Philip Jones, conductor of the internationally renowned Philip Jones Brass Ensemble. Meeting such distinguished international musicians inspired Sekine to continue to develop his skills as a teacher and conductor. Mr. Harada, who later became the Executive Director of the Japan Marching Band Baton Twirling Association, also helped guide Mr. Sekine during this period. A major event that promoted the growth of band music in Japan was the World EXPO held in Osaka in 1970. One of the bands featured during that event was the Purdue University Band from Lafayette, Indiana. The performances by the Purdue Band, an in particular the Band's ‚ÄúGolden Girl‚Äù Selita Sue Smith, had a lasting effect on the 64 million people who attended the EXPO. Around this same time, Mr. Sekine attended a clinic in Japan held by Mr. Thomas Davis, a percussionist who was also the Director of the Marching Band at the University of Iowa from 1968 to 1972. Sekine's first trip to the U.S. was to see a marching band contest in Enid, Oklahoma in about 1970. During this trip, he also visited the Ludwig Drum Company in Chicago. Harada encouraged Sekine to travel to the U.S. to follow Drum Corps International events, which he started to do on a regular basis. ;Era of Growth An important moment in the development of the Aimachi Band came in 1970, when the Tenrikyo Young Men's Association invited the Band to perform at an event in Tokyo at the Nippon Budokan, a famous arena that was built to host the judo competition at the 1964 Summer Olympics events but has also hosted numerous other events such as indoor marching events and rock concerts, including those by groups such as the Beatles, Pearl Jam, Ozzy Osbourne, the Doobie Brothers and Journey. For this performance, the Aimachi Band designed its first field show using Japanese popular music and traditional block formations. The success of this performance led to discussions with Mr. Harada to organize, in March 1972, a marching band association for the bands in the midsection of the country, which was part of the All Japan Marching Band Association (in 1979, the name was changed to the All Japan Marching Band and Baton Twirling Association). For the next few years, the Aimachi Band would perform in Nagoya at events hosted by this Association in a non-competitive festival format, along with other bands from the area. Before the development of this Marching Band Association, the All Japan Band Association, which focused on concert bands, was already well established throughout the country. At that time, many of the concert bands avoided including marching activities into their programs due to a fear that it would be detrimental to the quality of the sound of their bands. Mr. Sekine introduced Mr. Harada, who was a member of the All Japan Band Association, to many of the band directors in the central part of Japan and helped to overcome these fears. Many Japanese band directors had resisted becoming involved in the marching activity due to space constraints at their schools, but larger obstacles were their lack of knowledge about it, a fear that it would be harmful to the quality of sound of their concert bands and that it was not part of the Japanese tradition up to that point. Mr. Harada was a key figure in helping to overcome these concerns, and the variety of international influences eventually led to a great deal of interest in marching bands and drum corps. In 1973, the All Japan Marching Band and Baton Twirling Association held its first national event at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, which had been built in 1954 for the World Wrestling Championship and was later used for gymnastic events at the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Aimachi Band appeared at this event, which at this time also used a non- competitive festival format. The Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium remained the site of this event until 1977, when it moved to the Nippon Budokan, where it remained for over 20 years. In August 1974, the Band traveled to Hawaii to perform at the Tenrikyo Hawaii Convention held by the Tenrikyo Hawaii Young Men's Association. Due to the importance placed on their performance by the leaders of the Tenri Church, the Band scheduled a great deal more rehearsal time than they had for earlier events, and the playing level dramatically improved. The divisions of the All Japan Marching Band and Baton Twirling Association included those for kindergartens, elementary schools, high schools and the open class that Aimachi participated in. The format of the event gradually evolved until the top two bands and baton corps in each division from each of three regions of the country (North, Midsection and South) met in Tokyo for an exhibition performance. A major change for the Aimachi Band occurred in 1975, when Mr. Sekine married Hatsume and relocated to Handa City. When he arrived there, he had to build the Tenri Church membership starting with a very small group and very limited facilities. This made it infeasible for him to continue working with the Aimachi Band, at that time still located at the Aimachi Church in Nagoya, and he stepped down as Director. Once a site had been selected for the new church buildings in Handa City, he had to help cut down the trees and clear the land to make it possible to start construction. Finally, in 1981, the new Aikiyo Church opened in its current location. The Sekine family grew with the births of four children, Kazue, Tatsuo, Yoshie, and Kiyotaka. A new director of the Aimachi Band was selected by Mr. Sekine and for the next few years the Band continued along as it had before. In 1982, Mr. Sekine returned as Director and was assisted by Mr. Narita in building the quality of the Band. Sekine then started going to the U.S. on a regular basis to see drum corps competitions and meet staff from many American bands and drum corps. Throughout the 1980s the Band remained relatively small (around 40 or 50 members). The Band continued to travel to the Final performance at the Budokan (except in 1986 when they were involved in several events at the main church in Tenri), but since it was only an exhibition performance, there was not a lot of motivation for band members to always be at rehearsal, or to push to a higher level of performance. This changed in 1990, when the Final performance became a competition. The Aimachi Band found themselves far down in the rankings, and as a result, decided to work harder to achieve the goal of winning the Final competition. Mr. Sekine became more involved in the day to day rehearsals. Sekine also invited a number of Japanese clinicians to come work with the Band. One of these was Fukuda Makato, the Director of the Tenri High School Marching Band around this time. Fukuda brought the Tenri Band to perform at the 1990 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California. At the same time as this trip to the U.S., the Band was preparing for their field show performance at the All Japan Marching Band and Baton Twirling Association Championship less than two weeks after their return to Japan (in 1990, this event changed its non-competitive format into a contest within each division). To help with their preparations, Fukuda asked an American clinician he knew, Frank Dorritie, to come work with his Band while they were in Pasadena, however, Frank was unavailable that week and he suggested that Mr. Fukuda call Gordon Henderson, Director of the Marching Band at UCLA and the Brass Arranger for the Santa Clara Vanguard Drum and Bugle Corps, since he lived close to Pasadena. Mr. Henderson spent a day with the Tenri Band to work on their ‚ÄúWest Side Story‚Äù field show. Upon Fukuda's return to Japan, Sekine asked him about possible American arrangers and clinicians for the Aimachi Band and he suggested that he contact Mr. Henderson. For the 1991-92 season, Mr. Henderson arranged a show based on Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Unfortunately, the Band was not able to perform at the Championship at the Budokan in Tokyo that year due to a problem at the finals of the regional competition. During that performance, a member of the Band made a mistake of stepping over the boundary line that resulted in a ten- point penalty (out of 100!) and caused the Band to not qualify for the Final Competition. ;Drum and Bugle Corps Influences Drum Corps International Championship videos started becoming available in Japan in the late 1970s and members of the Aimachi Band loved to watch these over and over again. Around this time, a percussionist in the Aimachi Band, Uichi Kajiyama, met a member of the Velvet Knights Drum Corps percussion section who was Japanese when the Aimachi Band performed on a TV show called ‚ÄúDo Marching World.‚Äù Uichi began to express an interest in traveling to the U.S. to march in one of the American drum and bugle corps as a way to learn more about the marching activity. Many Aimachi Church members were not in favor of this, but Mr. Sekine wholeheartedly supported it, since he thought that it would be a great asset for the Aimachi Band to have someone with that training to help the Band once they returned. Although Uichi did not yet have the skills as a percussionist to perform with one of the top DCI corps, he did tour as a volunteer with the Cavaliers from Rosemont, Illinois for the 1992 season. Uichi had originally planned to tour with the Santa Clara Vanguard, but when Mr. Henderson was hired by the Cavaliers as the Head Brass Instructor, Mr. Fukuda recommended that Uichi go to Cavaliers instead. During this first year in Rosemont, Uichi met several other Cavalier staff and marching members who would later become members of Aimachi's staff, including Mitch Rogers, Jim Campbell, Michael Gaines, Michael Tarr, and Rosie Miller Queen. After his volunteer chores each day, Uichi would practice diligently and observe rehearsals and performance. Uichi marched as a member of the Cavaliers percussion section in 1993 through 1996. During this time, he was enrolled in Concordia College in Chicago studying English. Over the next several years, more Aimachi Band members, including two of his children, Kazue and Kiyotaka, traveled to the U.S. to join various drum corps including the Cadets, Blue Devils, Carolina Crown, Santa Clara Vanguard, Troopers, Blue Stars, Phantom Regiment and several more to the Cavaliers. Most of these people returned to the Band and have served as instructors or in leadership positions in the Band such as section leader. In 1992, after meeting Henderson during DCI Finals Week in Madison, Wisconsin, Sekine asked him to arrange a piece of music from the Tenri religion called ‚ÄúThe Truth of the Creation.‚Äù Mr. Henderson casually mentioned to Uichi that he would like to come to Japan someday to work with the Aimachi Band. Sekine immediately responded with an invitation to come visit in January 1993, as the Band prepared for the Final Competition. The Band finished third at the Budokan competition that year, behind the Yokohama Renaissance Vanguard and the Yokohama Inspires, but Henderson was able to give Sekine many ideas about how to improve the Band's performance, including instruments to purchase, designers and instructors to bring in and how to address problems with their practice facilities. In November 1993, Henderson returned to work with the Band along with the Band's new drill designer, Mitch Rogers, and percussion arranger, James Campbell. During this visit, Mr. Sekine asked the three Americans to come up with a hip, cool English nickname for him (Fukuda Makato was known to everyone as ‚ÄúMac‚Äù and Sekine wanted a similar moniker). After thinking about it for several days, the three came up with ‚ÄúCoz‚Äù which was drawn from the third syllable of his given name Kiyokazu. Through Sekine and Uichi's connections with the Cavaliers, Michael Gaines was hired to come to Japan to work with the Color Guard for the Aimachi Band and also to prepare the Color Guard for their first performance at the Winter Guard International Championships in Dayton, Ohio in 1996. Since then, the Color Guard has returned to perform at WGI in 1999, 2002, 2004 (in San Diego), 2007 and 2009. The Color Guard finished 3rd at the last two of the trips, but their performance at the 2004 WGI Championship may have made the most lasting impression, due to World Champion Twirler Seishi Inagaki's stunning featured performance with the group. Michael also brought in other clinicians to work with the group, such as Rosie Miller Queen and Jim Moore. ;Rehearsal Facilities During the Band's early years, the primary rehearsal site for the Band was the basement of the Aimachi Church in Nagoya. As the Band began to be more involved in ‚Äúfield‚Äù shows, it would practice in parks at night in downtown Nagoya. Once they started to become more serious about the competition in the early 1990s, they began practicing in gymnasiums all around Nagoya. During the week, these rehearsal would usually start about 6pm, but due to most members‚Äô school and work schedule, the full band rehearsal usually wouldn‚Äôt really get going until about 8pm. Most of the facilities would close at 9pm, meaning that at 8:45pm, there would be a mad scramble to move all of the instruments and equipment out of the gymnasium and back on the Band's truck. This would be repeated night after night! When the Band would travel to Tokyo for the Final Competition, they would practice outside, sometimes in wet, muddy (and cold) flood control areas. After it became apparent that these situations did not promote the best possible performance, they started to find gymnasiums in Tokyo on the day of the Final Competition starting in 1994. On weekends, especially on Sundays, a place was usually found that would allow for longer rehearsals, sometimes outside. In 1995, Mr. Sekine broke ground on a new gymnasium to be built on the grounds of the Aikiyo Church in Handa. This required moving the ‚ÄúDome House‚Äù (a guest house used by visiting church officials, instructors and some band members) off its foundation and over about 50 feet. The new gym has two levels. On the first floor these is a large office, rehearsal rooms for each brass section, a large rehearsal room for the full brass section, a large battery percussion rehearsal room, and storage rooms. The soundproofing of these rooms is so effective that even with the battery and full brass rooms adjacent to each other, the sound cannot be heard between the rooms. The second floor has a 40-meter square gym floor for band, percussion, color guard and twirler rehearsals. This mimics the size of many of the Band's performance venues that are built with a floor this size to accommodate sumo wrestling competitions. This floor also houses a small office, and a foyer that is used by the pit percussion section, along with other storage spaces. Above the gym floor is a walkway along all four sides with a small viewing area on one side, which is mainly used by instructors during rehearsals. Hanging from the ceiling is a huge banner displaying a photograph of Mr. Sekine's father, Sekine Toyomatsu. Over the years, banners and props from various shows have been hung from the ceiling and walkway. With the completion of this facility, the Band was able to rehearse more often, longer and more effectively than ever before. ;The First All Japan Championship From 1994 to 1997, the Band performed shows based on common themes such as the music from the opera Carmen, various symphonic band works, and Russian music. The Band improved its ranking to second place during this period but was unable to put together a championship show. Starting with the 1996 show, ‚ÄúWinds of Spain,‚Äù the Band started to perform at a much higher level. In 1997, the Aimachi Band's score tied for first place, but the Renaissance Vanguard was again named Champion due to the All Japan tiebreaking formula. Finally, in January 1998, the Band's ‚ÄúMiss Saigon‚Äù show put them on top. The music was taken from the Santa Clara Vanguard's show in 1991, but the outstanding feature of the show was a nearly full scale helicopter that was assembled by members of the Church. Since the door onto the competition field at the Budokan was very small, the helicopter had to be assembled in the back of the field during the Band's show and then hoisted on a scissor lift just as it made its appearance. A member of the Band sat inside the helicopter and operated the crank that spun the huge propeller. As the helicopter appeared at the end of the show, the crowd response was overwhelming and at the very end, the entire helicopter was spun around to create a very dramatic effect. With this victory, the Band's first at the All Japan Marching Band and Baton Twirling Association Championships, Mr. Sekine was inspired to come up with more spectacular and unusual effects to introduce in future shows. After coming in second in 1999, the Band looked for a theme for the next year's show that would take advantage of their strong drumline and decided that a show entitled ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äù would do that, and it also opened up numerous opportunities for costuming and other effects. In 2001, Mr. Sekine decided to do a show entitled ‚ÄúNative American.‚Äù To do research for this show, Mr. Sekine traveled to Calgary, Alberta, Canada to visit with Mr. Robert Eklund, President of the World Association of Marching Show Bands, who took him to visit Indian tribes there and gather ideas for costuming, movements and props. The Aimachi Band took first place with both of these shows that featured elaborate costuming and props, which led the All Japan Marching Band Baton Twirling Association to create rules that limited the size and nature of props that would be allowed in shows. However, these new rules did not stop the Aimachi Band and Mr. Sekine became even more creative with effects that he incorporated into the shows. The Aimachi Band became the first band in this division to be invited to perform in exhibition at the All Japan Championship the following year, 2002. The Band put together another consecutive pair of Championships in January 2006 and 2007, with shows entitled ‚ÄúGear‚Äù and ‚ÄúFinal Tradition,‚Äù which led to the exhibition appearance at the All Japan Championships in December 2007, performing a show entitled ‚ÄúHoliday in New York‚Äù which displayed more comical effects than are normally found in Aimachi's shows. Two more consecutive Championships were achieved in December 2008 and 2009 with very controversial shows. In 2008, the show was entitled ‚ÄúGuernica‚Äù that told the story of a love affair between a German soldier and a peasant girl during the Spanish Civil War. The 2009 show, entitled ‚ÄúVirus,‚Äù showed a mad scientist creating a deadly disease in his laboratory with another team of ‚Äúgood‚Äù scientists racing to find an antidote to prevent an epidemic! Once again, the Aimachi Band was honored to perform in exhibition at the 38th Annual All Japan Championships. Over the previous six years, the Aimachi Band had completed an amazing stretch of four Championships and two exhibition performances. For the exhibition performance at the 38th Annual, Mr. Sekine designed a show that conveyed a strong sense of Japanese tradition, because he planned to take this show to Basel, Switzerland in July, 2011 to perform at the internationally renown Basel Tattoo along with ensembles from Switzerland, England, Scotland, Germany, Australia, Ireland, and Bahrain. The Aimachi Band performed over a dozen times during the week-long event, and took sightseeing trips to Lucerne, Interlaken, and Strasbourg. The trip to Basel was a great way to celebrate the most successful era in the Band's history. Many of the Aimachi Band members who marched with DCI corps became friends with many Americans who expressed an interest in coming to Japan to march with the Aimachi Band, and for the next several years, there was almost always a few veterans of top DCI corps marching in the Band. This practice ended after the 2008 season when the All Japan Association decided that only foreigners with visas would be allowed to perform. At the same time, several Thais came to Aimachi to march, and since they were required to obtain visa to come to Japan, they were not affected by this new rule. ;Show Themes December 1973 (1st Annual All-Japan National Championship) ‚Äì ‚ÄúTruth‚Äù January, 1975 (2nd Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúNew Sound in Marching‚Äù 1977 (4th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúFight the Field‚Äù 1982 (9th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe New World‚Äù 1983 (10th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúSong for Departure‚Äù 1984 (11th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúNew Sound 84‚Äù 1985 (12th Annual) - ‚ÄúAi (Love) March‚Äù 1986 ‚Äì did not compete due to events at Tenri for the church 1987 (14th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúMemory‚Äù 1988 (15th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúSpace Alive‚Äù 1989 (16th Annual ‚Äì ‚ÄúPassion For Love‚Äù 1990 (17th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúAimachi 90‚Äù 1991 (18th Annual) ‚Äì Finals held in Nagoya due to reconstruction of the Budokan 1992 (19th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúBeethoven‚Äôs Ninth Symphony‚Äù, Drum Major Mr. Michihusa Sato 1993 (20th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Truth of the Creation‚Äù, Drum Major Mr. Michihusa Sato 1994 (21st Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Music of France‚Äù, Drum Major Mr. Michihusa Sato 1995 (22nd Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúInternational Symphonic Works‚Äù, Drum Major Mr. Michihusa Sato 1996 (23rd Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúWinds of Spain‚Äù, Drum Major Mr. Michihusa Sato 1997 (24th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúTreasures of Russia‚Äù, Drum Major Mr. Michihusa Sato 1998 (25th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúMiss Saigon\\" (1st Place), Drum Major Mr. Michihusa Sato 1999 (26th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúPhantom of the Opera‚Äù, Drum Major Mr. Michihusa Sato January 21‚Äì22, 2000 (27th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äù (1st Place) Drum Major Mr. Michihusa Sato 2001 (28th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúNative American‚Äù (1st Place) Drum Major Mr. Michihusa Sato 2001 Sudler Shield Award presented by the John Philip Sousa Foundation 2002 (29th Annual) ‚Äì ‚ÄúVirtuoso - Dream Entertainment‚Äù (Exhibition) Drum Major Mr. Michihusa Sato July 27, 2002 ‚Äì WAMSB World Championship for Marching Show Bands held in Chiba, Japan.

It has a morphological classification of SA(s)0/a, which indicates it is a lenticular galaxy of the pure spiral type. This is a starburst galaxy, which means it is forming new stars at a high rate. This is occurring in a band of gas surrounding the central nucleus. There is a single arm, which spirals outward from this ring. It is frequently but not consistently identified as a member of the Leo Triplet group. This galaxy is known to contain two counter-rotating populations of stars. That is, one set of stars is rotating in the opposite direction with respect to the other. One means for this to occur is by acquiring gas from an external source, which then undergoes star formation. An alternative is by a merger with a second galaxy. Neither scenario has been ruled out. The age of the lower mass, counter-rotating population is younger by about than the primary star population of the galaxy.

A bead breaker is a tool used for separating tires from rims. The innermost diameter of the tire that interfaces with the rim of a wheel is called the tire bead. The bead is a thicker section of rubber, and is reinforced with braided steel cables, called the bead bundle.https://beadbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ST_2.0.jpg The surface of the bead creates a seal between the tire and rim on radial and bias-ply tires. Often, the bead can become stuck to the rim after rusting or corrosion occurs, requiring the use of a bead breaker in order to be removed.  Usage  Tire changers have a semi-automated bead loosening system for removing tires, but due to the high cost and lack of portability, these were not suitable in many cases. In addition, tire beads adhered to rims by heat or rust must often be broken free manually; in these cases, a bead breaker is ideal. Used like a chisel, a bead breaker leverages a mechanical advantage to drive the bead away from the rim. A need was experienced by 4x4 enthusiasts and overland travellers for a simple tool to effectively and efficiently remove the tire from the rim of a wheel, in the event that a tire requires repairs to its inside. Many vehicles, including ATVs, motorcycles, passenger vehicles, trucks, off-road vehicles, and light aircraft have an additional feature on the rim called the bead retainer, a ridge that prevents the tire bead from slipping inward on the rim and losing the air seal. On ATVs and UTVs, these bead retainers are substantially large, as their tires are often run at very low air pressures (~) and experience severe side loading forces from trail riding. The large bead retainer is necessary to prevent unintentional dislocation of the tire bead from the bead seat. Furthermore, if an ATV tire does lose pressure from a puncture, the large bead retainer will keep the tire in place for low-speed riding, allowing the rider to navigate to the trail head without the tire coming completely off of the rim. While the large bead retainers of ATVs are quite effective at keeping the tire in place during operating conditions, they also prevent tires from being easily changed with normal tools even in a shop setting.  Types  There are three categories of tire bead breaker designs: the \\"shoe-and-lever\\" mechanism, the \\"plier-type\\" mechanism, and the \\"clamp-and-ram\\" mechanism. 208x208px = Shoe- and-lever-type = The shoe-and-lever mechanism performs well on many motorcycle tires, passenger vehicle tires and trailers, but with more difficult tires, it often fails because of the nature of the design. A shoe, operated by a lever, pushes down on the tire sidewall next to the tire bead, and if the bead is stuck, the shoe may slip and press against the middle of the sidewall instead.https://beadbuster.com/wp- content/uploads/2015/09/ST_3.2B-325x477.jpg Furthermore, due to their design (which uses a stand), shoe-and-lever bead breakers are quite large, and thus not a good portable solution for tire changes. These bead breakers are typically inexpensive compared to other designs. = Plier-type = The plier- type mechanism has a spike that pushes in between the tire bead and lip of the rim, putting a separating force on the bead bundle. However, the pivot point results in an arc that quickly transitions to pushing on the sidewall. Plier- type bead breakers are generally more effective than shoe-and-lever designs, but they have some disadvantages. Such tools must be adjusted for different diameter wheels, and since the metal part of the tool makes contact with the rim, it may scratch aluminum or painted wheels. Some coordination and balance is required, as the user has to stand on the tire and use their body weight to operate the tool. It is fairly large yet portable, and is often used in races for pit stop tire changes. Ultimately, this type of bead breaker also struggles to work reliably on the stubborn tires of ATVs, 4x4 trucks, and tractors. The cost of plier-type bead breakers varies. = Clamp-and-ram-type = Lastly, the clamp-and-ram mechanismhttps://beadbuster.com/wp- content/uploads/2015/09/bd381dcf84a06ddbf81e3aa6a82b4263.jpg is perhaps the most effective for breaking beads on ATVs and other difficult-to-change tires, in addition to being fairly compact. This style of tool has a pointed foot that sits on the sidewall and enters the space between the tire bead and lip of the rim, and a padded clamp that screws into position. The ram foot is then actuated by another screw, breaking the bead loose. Because the tool is clamped in place, it cannot slide down the sidewall and damage the tire. Since the ram foot pushes directly on the steel bead bundle of the tire, it works well on old and deteriorated tires.

He was South Africa's first trained architect and brought with him a distinctive mannered neo-classicism.  Life and career  Born 28 September 1750 in Picquigny, Picardy in France, Thibault was trained at the Royal Academy of Architecture in Paris. At the time, the Academy under Ange-Jacques Gabriel, provided the best architectural training available. Gabriel was an architect in the classical tradition, and had an important formative influence on Thibault's style. After qualifying at the Academy, details of the next few years of Thibault's life are unknown. It is known, however, that he studied military engineering in Paris under the sponsorship of Colonel Charles Daniel de Meuron. Cape under Dutch occupation to 1795 The Swiss mercenary DeMeuron Regiment in the service of the Dutch East India Company, arrived in Cape Town on 7 January 1783 with Lieutenant Thibault among them, only to re-embark almost immediately on the Hermione to Ceylon where they were to assist French Admiral Suffren. Ceylon had been under Dutch rule since 1665, but in the latter part of the 18th century, the British began to move eastward from India. In Ceylon, the DeMeuron Regiment took part in the expulsion of the British from Cuddalore, which had been occupied by the English under General Stuart. Two other regiments, the R√©giment de Pondich√©ry and the mercenary Legion of the Prince of Luxemburg, were posted at the Cape and landed in Cape Town in April 1782 by order of Admiral de Suffren to reinforce the resistance of France's Dutch ally and prevent their mutual enemy, Britain, from capturing the Cape. After peace in Ceylon, the DeMeuron Regiment shared garrison duty with the R√©giment de Pondich√©ry, in Cape Town. On 5 August 1785 he transferred to the Dutch East India Company, retaining his rank, and in February 1786 was appointed Company building inspector under Captain Sebastiaan Willem van de Graaff, son of the Governor. In August 1786 he was chosen to direct the School of Cadets started by the Governor; his duties included being Professor of Mathematics and Military Science. Thibault settled in a place that came to be known as the Brand House, and later the Wale Street police-station. Between 1786 and 1790 Thibault designed all new public buildings and a number of private houses. From this date on Thibault's work is associated with that of Anton Anreith, a young sculptor and woodcarver from Freiburg, who had arrived as a soldier in the Company's service in 1777, and with Hermann Schutte, a young architect and builder from Bremen who arrived in 1789. In 1790 the Dutch East India Company was virtually bankrupt and all work on public buildings and fortifications was stopped. Private commissions, however, continued unabated. In 1788 Thibault had been promoted from lieutenant of engineers to captain and by 1795 to chief military engineer. Before and during the British occupation of the Cape, Thibault was obliged to carry out orders from Colonels de Lille and Gordon, which as an accomplished military strategist, he knew to be unsound. Cape under British occupation 1795‚Äì1803 It was in that capacity that he and Major Georg K≈©hler drew up an inventory of the assets of the liquidated Dutch East India Company in 1795, when the British occupied the Cape. Thibault lost all the privileges of rank and became a civilian once more. Major-General James Henry Craig, who was acting governor at the Cape from 1795 to 1797, discovered that Thibault was compiling a map of the Colony. Craig proposed that Thibault donate the map to him in return for the position of royal geographical engineer ‚Äì an offer which Thibault declined, also turning down a later offer of 100 guineas. Craig was succeeded by Earl Macartney and Major-General Francis Dundas. In 1799 Dundas put Thibault in charge of repairs to military buildings as an architect. When Sir George Yonge, 5th Bt (1731‚Äì1812) replaced Dundas as Governor, he appointed Thibault as architect of military works under his aide- de-camp. Cape under Dutch rule 1803‚Äì1806 As he had sworn allegiance to England, Thibault went through a period of disfavour when the Cape was returned to the Dutch. Nevertheless, he was appointed Inspector of Public Buildings, which allowed him to design all new public buildings, and supervise their construction and repair. Cape under British occupation 1806 onwards Despite Thibault's having served under General JW Janssens in the field, Sir David Baird who had become Acting Governor, reappointed him Inspector of Public Buildings. The British though preferred their Georgian Colonial architecture and used their own architects, so that Thibault had very few commissions. He accordingly became a sworn surveyor in 1807 and in 1811 followed Jan Willem Wernich as Government surveyor. The final years of his life were largely taken up with surveying properties on the road from Cape Town to Simonstown. In 1811 a special commission was appointed to determine the extent of land around Cape Town which was not in private hands and therefore regarded as \\"disposable\\" by the Government. This led to beacons and boundaries frequently being moved by the Commission over the objections raised by Thibault. His health rapidly deteriorated during this time and he died on 15 November 1815 of pneumonia, believed by his widow to have been brought on by his working in the cold and wet. He was buried in the Somerset graveyard, at a point now under the lower part of the Buitengracht.  Family  On 2 April 1786, Louis Michel Thibault married Elizabeth van Schoor d. 11 June 1820, daughter of an old Cape family.

Buildings  Even though his association with Anreith and Schutte was not a legal partnership, they worked together whenever possible, having complete faith in each other's professional competence and integrity. A fourth person, the wood-worker JJ Graaff, worked with them on so many projects that he is normally included in references to the partnership. Except for Anreith, who was a confirmed bachelor and lived in a modest house in Bloem Street, the others helped each other out with modifications and additions to their respective homes. Graaff's house at 14 Keerom Street had changes by way of an upper storey with cornice and architrave with fluted pilasters at the front door. Thibault bought the house at 17 Heerengracht, site of the present Markham's building. =Some of Thibault's important works= * Papenboom, Newlands for Dirk Gysbert van Reenen (1787‚Äì88).

The project was commenced by the Dowding Labor government in the late 1980s, and its main feature project was the Joondalup railway line and linked bus services, which have been a core component of the Transperth transport network since the line's opening to passengers on 21 March 1993. The need for the project arose from the rapid and sustained growth of the northern suburbs of Perth during the 1970s and 1980s, which had placed a considerable strain on infrastructure, including the bus system and the Mitchell Freeway. However, prior to the opening of the railway, the proposal was controversial as many in the community believed that upgrading the Mitchell Freeway or providing a guided busway would be better solutions. The Northern Suburbs Transit System name has been used subsequently for additions to the original line, including the Currambine to Butler extension which was built as far as Clarkson in 2004, and extended to Butler in 2014. History The transport needs of Perth's northern corridor were evaluated as far back as 1982, with the preparation of the report Transport 2000 ‚Äì A Perth Study by the then Office of the Director General of Transport. Accessed at State Records Office of Western Australia, Perth The report looked at Perth's transport needs into the 21st century and beyond, at a broad strategic level. It provided some strategic travel forecasts, and made a limited evaluation of rapid transit options for the northern corridor. By the late 1980s, the Mitchell Freeway, along with major arterial routes servicing the northern corridor, were constantly clogged during peak hour, with the community at large dissatisfied with the bus services provided for the region. The government of the day, after a strong political push, decided to plan and construct a rail service, to known as the Northern Suburbs Rapid Transit System. It was aimed at restructuring the bus network for the northern corridor, while going some way to reduce car dependence in Perth. =The case for rail= As part of research into community attitudes on public transport within the northern corridor, Donovan Research was engaged during 1987 to undertake focus group and telephone research to determine information on the following key points: Pg. 1, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth * Determine people's overall beliefs and attitudes about and expectations from Transperth; * Determine major perceived issues of importance related to public transport within the region; * Ascertain attitudes towards the concept of a transport liaison committee; * Measure interest in participation in such a committee; * Obtain specific information as to the various aspects of suggested operation of the committee, such as communications channels used, method of community participation; and * To obtain specific demographic information from respondents. The focus groups consisted of two sub-groups of participants, one consisting of public transport users residing within established suburbs, and the other of public transport users from newer and developing suburbs. Combined within these sub-groups were subsets of both regular and irregular users, with regular users being defined as those using public transport at least once per week. The participants from both sub-groups all held similar views in relation to the public transport; that of bus overcrowding, poor connections, poor timing, and poor route design impacted negatively on their perceptions and opinions of public transport. Over 43% of the participants described the public transport system as it currently stood as either poor or very poor. Public Transport for Perth‚Äôs Northern Suburbs In its 1986 election campaign platform, the Australian Labor Party stated that \\"A study will be conducted on the most appropriate form of rapid transit service for the northern suburbs.\\" Accessed at State Records Office of Western Australia, Perth Accessed at State Records Office of Western Australia, Perth The study was commenced in early 1988 under the auspices of the then Minister for Transport and Small Business, after receiving Cabinet approval 10 November 1987. Due to the budget position of the then Department of Transport, it was not possible to fund the nine-month project from within its existing budget, which necessitated a request to Treasury for additional funds. The Minister for Budget Management approved the request for additional funding, allocating A$150,000 (1987) for the study. The study entitled Public Transport for Perth‚Äôs Northern Suburbs was completed in September 1988 by consulting firms Travers Morgan, Pack Poy and Kneebone, Blackwell and Associated, and Uloth and Associates. It evaluated a number of rapid transport options for Perth's northern corridor as well as garnering public feedback on those options. Amongst the methods used to collect data for the report were surveys sent to residents of Beldon, Duncraig, Balga, and Karrinyup, along with previous respondents to a survey initiated through local papers in December 1987. Accessed at State Records Office of Western Australia, Perth At the time, members of the then Liberal-National Coalition Opposition, and local community groups, rallied against what they claimed was the lack of the then government's commitment to transport in the northern corridor. Accessed at State Records Office of Western Australia, Perth Opposition Leader Barry MacKinnon called on the state government to put plans to construct a new northern suburbs highway on hold, and redirect funds to upgrading and extending the Mitchell Freeway instead. He also commented that northern suburbs residents faced road journeys of up to an hour to reach the Perth CBD. This was a view also supported by the then president of the Greenwood, Kingsley, Warwick, and Woodvale Citizens' Association, Cheryl Edwardes (later the Liberal Member for Kingsley and Environment Minister during the Court Government). Preliminary studies evaluated a number of possible options including: * Buses on a separate roadway * Guided busway (similar to the O-bahn in Adelaide) * Light rail * Heavy rail * Automated trains on a guideway * High-capacity monorail * Automated people mover systems The majority of these options were rejected on the basis that introducing another mode of public transport to the city would serve little or no purpose, considering the existing modes of bus and rail functioned effectively. A number of routes were examined for use as part of the eventual system, which included: Accessed at State Records Office of Western Australia, Perth * West Coast Highway * Mitchell Freeway * west of the Mitchell Freeway * east of the Mitchell Freeway * Wanneroo Road * Alexander Drive During the study, various surveys were undertaken to establish public attitudes towards the transport options that were being considered. In order of preference respondents selected electric railway (41%), bus expressway (34.4%), guided busway (19.3%). The most important factors making a selection were faster journeys, and lower capital costs. However, those who preferred the electric railway option cited greater comfort, less crowding, and less pollution as important factors in their preference. In addition, quite a number of respondents liked the railway idea due to it being \\"forward thinking\\". In his response, then Minister for Transport Bob Pearce noted the recommendation by the consultants for the implementation of a bus-based system using an exclusive right-of-way in the median of the Mitchell Freeway. However, he noted that further detailed evaluation of a rail-based option was still being carried out. The report noted that while its preference was to construct a bus expressway, the extension of such a busway beyond Warwick would provide little or no benefits in terms of speed, time, and economics. During the public debate over the future of public transportation in the northern corridor, Transport Minister Pearce claimed that the NSTS would never be built under a Liberal coalition government. Opposition Leader Barry MacKinnon stated that charge was \\"totally untrue\\". Accessed at State Records Office of Western Australia, Perth 1989 Transport Study As part of the analysis of a rail service in Perth's northern corridor, a comprehensive study was undertaken in 1989 to establish the best route and potential station options. Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth The locations of possible station sites included: * Burns Beach Road (to include park-and-ride space, due to limitations at Joondalup, and rail storage, as well as providing for further extension northward); * Joondalup; * Ocean Reef Road; * Whitfords Avenue; * Hepburn Avenue; * Dunwood (named for its location between the suburbs of Duncraig and Greenwood); * Warwick Bus Station; * Northern Perimeter Highway (now known as the Reid Highway); * Erindale Road; * Wishart Street; * Cedric Street; * McDonald Street; * Scarborough Beach Road; and * Oxford Street. At the time, a possible deviation of the rail alignment was considered to directly service the suburb of Innaloo. However, this idea was rejected by both the project coordinators and the public at large due to the significant cost, lack of identifiable benefits, and environmental impact. The study predicted that by 2001, the line would have 13,000 passenger boardings during peak hour. Over 12,000 of these passengers were predicted to board the services prior to reaching the maximum load point, defined by the report as Scarborough Beach Road. =Alternate suggestions= A number of theoretically innovative ideas for possible transport systems were put forward by various people within the Western Australian business and transport communities, but ultimately rejected. Personal Vehicle Fast Track System One proposal, from Tom Proctor, Managing Director of Modular Commuting Systems, was for a \\"Personal Vehicle Fast Track System\\", in which car-like vehicles travelled automatically, suspended from an overhead beam. The vehicles were then used as electronically driven cars on the road once having reached the end of the track network. Proctor claimed that the system had been selected for use in connecting two shopping centres and other local infrastructure in Campbelltown, New South Wales, but the Acting Deputy Director General was not impressed with the concept having shifted a number of times in conversation and there still not a working prototype in place for evaluation. Linear induction-based rail system Retired engineering design consultant, John Stephens, told the Wanneroo Times that a skytrain system using a linear induction motor would be ideal for use along the Mitchell Freeway. Accessed at State Records Office of Western Australia, Perth He said that the proposed rail line in the middle of the freeway would be an eyesore, and claimed that skytrain systems installed in Vancouver, Toronto, and Boston had been quite successful. =Enabling legislation= State Cabinet gave in-principle support for the construction of a railway and the enabling legislation passed parliament and was assented to on 15 January 1989. The first spike for the line was driven on 14 November 1989, by then Premier Peter Dowding. Project Scope While the original project to construct the line was known as the Northern Suburbs Transit System, all subsequent projects involving additions or upgrades to the line have carried the same name. =Original Project= The project was estimated to cost $220 million (1989), including $130 million (1989) for infrastructure including earthworks, bridges, and stations. A further $90 million (1989) would be spent on the purchase of a 22 additional two-car electric trains, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perthnow known as the A-series train. The remaining cost of the trains was to be funded from a financing package being drafted by the government. The proposed rail line would run along the centre of the Mitchell Freeway, and designed to closely link the new rail infrastructure with bus services through the construction of several interchange stations along the route. The proposed project initially included: * 29.2 km of electric rail line from Perth Station to Joondalup Station; * The construction of seven stations; * New footbridges at Oxford Street, Britannia Road and Leeder Street; * Construction of three road and railway bridges at Vincent, Powis, and Scarborough Beach Roads within the freeway reserve; * Construction of a new road bridge at Ocean Reef Road; * Construction of tunnels at Roe Street, Hodges Drive/Joondalup Drive, Collier Pass, Joondalup Drive/Shenton Avenue (Double Segment), and Moore Drive; * Replacement of existing pedestrian level crossing at Milligan Street with a Pedestrian Bridge; * Construction of new western concourse at Perth station and appropriate facilities; and * Passenger Information Systems Related to the project was the realignment of the Mitchell Freeway between Loftus and McDonald Streets. At the time, the northbound and southbound carriages of the freeway in this section were constructed next to each other. To allow for the rail corridor down the middle of the freeway, that section of road required realignment. While necessary bridges and some associated works for the realignment were included as part of the project cost, the rebuilding of the section of road in the realigned section was funded separately from the project, using regular road funding sources. The transit system was designed to provide for a rapid service, allowing rail cars using the line to operate at speeds of , which would allow a journey from Perth to Joondalup to be completed in approximately 20 minutes. Stage One Stations Stations to be constructed as part of the first stage of the project were: * Glendalough; * Stirling; * Warwick; * Whitfords; * Edgewater; and * Joondalup The first stage of the project was expected to be operation by the end of 1992. Stage Two Stations A station to be constructed as part of the projects second stage was: * North Joondalup, which later became known as Currambine The second stage of the project was expected to be in operation by the middle of 1993. Future Station options Other possible future stations sites included: * Oxford Street (which later became known as Leederville); * Near Wishart Street, Gwelup; and * Greenwood Fitzgerald Street Bus Bridge Already in existence prior to the planning for the line was a level crossing at the intersection of Fitzgerald and Roe streets in central Perth. The crossing allowed buses coming from Wellington Street Bus Station to connect with Fitzgerald Street and then run to the northern and north-eastern suburbs. Due to the need to construct a rail tunnel under Roe Street, it was considered unsafe and impractical to retain the existing level crossing, because it would be situated very near the tunnel entrance, and so make impossible for train drivers to see any vehicles on the crossing and take evasive action. That led to the construction of the Fitzgerald Street Bus Bridge. Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth Estimated in 1991 to cost $2.88 million, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth the bridge was designed as a flyover from Roe Street, accommodating two bus lanes, and a shared use path for pedestrian and cycle movements. To construct the bridge, a significant amount of land then occupied by a Perth City Council car park, and a number of buildings, would have to be compulsorily acquired. However the planned flyover was abandoned in favour of moving the existing level crossing some 250 metres to the west of its original position underneath the Hamilton Interchange approaches. In 2008 construction began on the Perth Arena Bus Bridge, crossing Roes Street, which would offer a similar route to the abandoned Fitzgerald Street option. Railcar financing When the project commenced, it was believed that Westrail, then responsible for the provision and management of metropolitan rail transport for Transperth, would not have enough rolling stock to operate the new line. Further to that, the funding available to Westrail would not permit the purchase of rolling stock from current or future operating funds. On 20 November 1989, the State Cabinet allowed Westrail to pursue an operating lease to permit the acquisition of the required 22 2-car A-series trains. Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth On 30 November 1989, the contract to construct the trains was awarded to Walkers-ABB despite a funding deal not being in place. Westrail sought out a financing arrangement to enable the purchase. In the end, options for the financing of the purchase came down to two companies, Westpac and Allco Leasing. One of the more interesting notes to the Allco proposal was the nature of the financing arrangements it was proposing. At the time of the proposed financing deal, interest rates in Australia were around 16-17%, placing a significant burden on companies in their business dealings. To work around this, Allco proposed a financing structure that involved a cross-border financing arrangement in Japan. It also required the establishment of a special purposes lessor company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, to minimise withholding tax liabilities from the Japanese and Australian taxation agencies. Allco refused to release specific information on the proposed structure, due to its policy prohibiting the release of specific details of this financing arrangement until it had secured a mandate for their services. On 29 April 1991, after much deliberation, then Minister for Transport, Pam Beggs, made a recommendation to State Cabinet that the financing package offered by Westpac be accepted. Her recommendation was subsequently approved by Cabinet on 20 May 1991. The final financial facility provided by Westpac was valued in 1991 at over $160 million, to be paid off over a period of 20 years. However, the establishment of the funding facility was not without significant incident. Substantial argument between the Western Australian Government and Westpac ensued, in respect of liability if Westrail defaulted on payments. Of concern was the recourse Westpac would have against the Western Australian Government Consolidated Revenue Fund, particularly in the context of the Crown Suits Act of 1889 and 1947, if such a default event occurred. The position of Westpac's lawyers was in direct conflict with that of the Government's legal advisors on the project, Mallesons Stephen Jaques. The Government's lawyers considered that Westpac would have reasonable recourse against the Government, and its Consolidated Revenue Fund, in the event that a default occurred. One solution proposed by Clayton Utz was to enjoin the Minister for Transport as a party to the financing facility contract. However, after further significant problems arose with proposed changes by Westpac to the funding arrangements, its contract for the finance facility was terminated in August 1992. =Currambine to Clarkson Extension= In 2000, the Department of Transport released the report from the Urban Rail Planning and Implementation Steering Committee outlining plans for the extension of the line from Currambine to Clarkson, and its continuation to a new railway depot to be located at Nowergup, within the future Mitchell Freeway reserve. Pg. 1, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth This was the result of a commitment from the then Court Liberal Government that it would extend the Joondalup Line from Currambine to Clarkson during its term of government. The report was initiated following the completion of the South West Metropolitan Railway (SWMR) Master Plan, which was the basis of the Mandurah railway line and associated works. Estimated in 2001 to cost $81 million, Pg. 89, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth the report recommended the undertaking of the following works to complete the project: Pg. 55-56, 65, 67-71, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth * The amendment of the Metropolitan Region Scheme to excise 202 hectares of land from the adjoining Neerabup National Park, while returning some 572 hectares to the park in the same adjustment; * Acquisition of relevant lands, funded from the 2000/2001 state budget; * The construction of a new Currambine Station to a location in the middle of the Mitchell Freeway reserve, along with associated approach works; * Demolition of the existing Currambine Station, including associated sidings and rolling-stock cleaning facilities; * Construction of the Clarkson Station and associated works; * Construction of a rail bridge at Burns Beach Road; * Construction of a road bridge at Hester Avenue; * Construction of a new rail depot at Nowergup; * Construction of the rail reserve and four kilometres of railway track from Burns Beach Road to Nowgerup, along with associated works including communications and signalling; * Lengthening existing station platforms along the line to 144 metres to accommodate 6-car trains; Pg. 74, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth and * The purchase and delivery of new rolling stock at a cost of $23 million (2000). The plan also recommended a delay in the construction of Greenwood Station, because it could not be adequately serviced until additional rolling stock had been delivered. Pg. 4, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth The project was to be funded from government borrowings over four years from 2001 to 2004. Pg. 3, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth The supply of additional rolling stock was critical to the completion of the project, particularly in the context of the future planned rail needs for Perth. Existing rolling stock was being utilised to capacity, and based on future projections, that included the operation of a fifth railway line and passenger numbers modelling, the size of the existing fleet would not be able to cope. Relocation of Currambine Station At the time of the project's proposal, there was significant community discussion relating to the relocation of the Currambine Station into the middle of the freeway reserve. In the 1989 master plan, the location of the station was designed to reduce the 'transfer penalty' in moving from train to bus/car, and to better integrate with the surrounding suburb. Pg. 9, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth The committee took these factors into account in its final report, and noted that the relocation was seen as having major environmental and social benefits. Improved frequency, journey speed, and reliability would be more significant factors than an additional walk. The report noted that this was supported by the fact that Warwick and Whitfords were at the time the busiest stations on NSTS, attracting a combined 18,000 passenger movements on weekdays. 60% of those passengers did not arrive or depart by bus, but arrived by car or by walking about across the Mitchell Freeway. Passenger modelling found that the relocation to the station would have no effect on project passenger boardings. The relocation would also help retain consistency with rest of the line and the future SWMR. It was further supported in surveys and opinion polls undertaken in Glen Iris, South Lakes and Atwell and with commercial business as part of SWMR planning processes. Pg. 10, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth If the railway station and subsequent rail reserve had remained on the western side of the freeway, there would have been significantly increased expenditure because of the need for additional noise reduction measures and other engineering works. Pg. 40, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth New Railway Depot While Nowergup was selected as the final site for the planned railway depot, Neerabup was suggested as the original site. Pg. 39, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth However, as the new railway depot would require some of space in the middle of the freeway reserve, it would have a significantly larger footprint in the Neerabup National Park. The environmental assessment recommended that the depot be relocated to a site in Nowergup to lower the environmental impact while retaining larger areas of the park in pristine condition. Parking and Facilities One of the other major problems noted in the report was the availability of parking at stations along the line. Pg. 37, Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth One of the key features of the Greenwood Station was to be additional parking, which would remove any need to construct a multi-story parking facility at Whitfords and Warwick Stations. That was in addition to the construction of a further 240 car parking bays at Whitfords Station, costing $780,000 in 2000, on the southern side of the station. Construction of a multi-story parking structure at Warwick was not considered as an option due to a number of social and environmental concerns. =Clarkson to Butler extension= In 2008, the state government announced a further extension to the line, taking it as far as the northern suburb of Butler. Previously, Alannah MacTiernan, the Planning and Infrastructure Minister, had announced that funds of $2.1 million (2007) had been set aside in the 2007-08 state budget for the Public Transport Authority to undertake preparation of the master plan for that segment of works. Some of the groundwork for the works had been laid during construction of the Clarkson to Currambine extension, with the rail surface necessary to allow access to the Nowergup railway depot already constructed as a two track reserve. That was in addition to the planning for that section recognising the need to further extend the railway to areas further north, beyond the depot. Construction of the extension commenced in 2011, with the opening of services planned for late 2014. By early 2014, works were running early, leading to a revised opening date of September 2014.

It dramatises a road trip by two parents and their three young children to visit grandparents for the Christmas holiday, and the emotional turmoil that they undergo. A significant element of the production schema is a Western, contemporary employment of bunraku, an ancient form of Japanese puppetry. Production history The play, under the direction of Oskar Eustis, premiered at Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, Rhode Island on May 16, 2003 as a co- production between Trinity Repertory Company and the Long Wharf Theatre. The play featured Samisen player Sumie Kaneko and puppets by Basil Twist.Hernandez, Ernio. \\"World Premiere of Vogel's 'The Long Christmas Ride Home' Plays RI, May 16-June 29\\" Playbill, May 16, 2003 The play opened Off- Broadway in November 2003 at the Vineyard Theatre, directed by Mark Brokaw. The cast featured Will McCormack (Stephen), Catherine Kellner (Rebecca), Enid Graham (Claire), Mark Blum (Father) and Randy Graff (Mother). The Japanesque set was designed by Neil Patel, with costumes by Jess Goldstein and puppetry by Basil TwistFinkle, David. \\"Review. 'The Long Christmas Ride Home'\\" theatermania.com, November 5, 2003 This production received 2004 Lucille Lortel Award nominations for: Outstanding Play, Outstanding Director, Outstanding Sound Design, (David Van Tieghem), and won the 2004 Lucille Lortel Award, Outstanding Featured Actor, Will McCormack. The play was presented at the Long Wharf Theatre (New Haven, Connecticut) in January and February 2004, directed by Oskar Eustis with the cast that featured Chelsea Altman, Angela Brazil, Timothy Crowe, Julio Monge, Anne Scurria and Stephen Thorne.Hernandez, Ernio. \\"Long Wharf's 'Long Christmas Ride Home' Starts in Connecticut, Jan. 14\\" Playbill, January 14, 2004 It has subsequently appeared throughout the United States in both university, regional, and Off-Broadway productions. Notable productions include those at the Studio Theatre (Washington, D.C.). Many of these productions have honored Vogel's assertion that the play, while partly about Christmas, is not meant as a seasonal \\"Christmas play\\" (unlike, for example, adaptations of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol). Therefore, like the world and New York City premieres, many productions are presented during what Vogel terms \\"the before and aftermath\\" of the holiday season (e.g., October, January). Characterization While the characters of the mother, father, and children (in adulthood) are portrayed by human performers, the children (in youth) are portrayed by puppeteers and initially voiced by narrators. Vogel bases the presence of puppets on what she claims is \\"one Westerner's misunderstanding of bunraku,\\" the centuries-old form of Japanese puppetry. (Vogel does, however, write that other styles of puppets would be acceptable, so long as the children-puppets do not become \\"cute or coy.\\") Vogel indicates the play's flexibility in regard to the use and number of puppeteers. Some productions, including the world premiere, utilize three- person bunraku teams to manipulate the puppets: an omozukai controls the right hand of the puppet, a hidarizukai controls the left hand of the puppet, and an ashizukai controls the feet. Other productions, sometimes responding to the economic considerations of hiring additional performers, have used a single puppeteer for each child puppet (though this makes it impossible to use traditional bunraku puppets). Regardless of the type of puppeteering arrangement employed, the chief (or in some cases, sole) puppeteer will later assume the role of the child as an adult. Both the 2003 world premiere at the Trinity Repertory Company and subsequent 2004 production at the Long Wharf Theatre featured bunraku puppets created by Basil Twist, a New York-based puppeteer. The traditional bunraku function of the Japanese tay≈´ (or chanter), who, among other narrative tasks, performs a puppet character's utterances, is fulfilled by the Man or Woman narrator at the beginning of the journey and then by a puppeteer (one per child character) in the latter part of the journey. In so doing, Vogel is able to continue the traditional tay≈´'s fluctuation between first-person and second-person address. The Man and Woman, who begin the play as omniscient narrators, soon assume the roles of the mother and father during the journey. These two performers initially speak all stage dialogue, including the lines of the children and some stage directions. Gradually, the three actors who begin the play as the chief puppeteers of the three children begin to speak the children's lines, relegating the Man and Woman to roles as the parents and occasional narrators. The human actors speaking the children's lines during the opening automobile journey abandon the puppets in the latter portion of the play to fully embody the adult characters during lengthy monologues. Music and sound Acknowledging the continual presence of music in traditional bunraku, Vogel has indicated her preference that \\"music and sound effects run under the entire play.\\" Many productions make great use of traditional Japanese music by shamisen players, though Vogel states that aural effects as varied as a boom box, Western Christmas carols \\"tuned to the tonal scales of bunraku,\\" wooden clappers, or Hawaiian guitars are acceptable. The music for the Off-Broadway premiere production in 2003 was performed live by Luke Notary.Brantley, Ben. \\"Theater Review. To Grandmother's House We Go (With Baggage)\\" The New York Times, November 5, 2003 Scenic design Vogel intends the work to be played on a \\"simple, elegant, bare\\" set: stools, benches, and simple chairs. Such minimalism will, she hopes, \\"allow the action [to] flow as much as possible.\\" Real stage properties (e.g., an actual umbrella) should be used only \\"when absolutely necessary.\\" Most major productions have adopted Vogel's suggested scenic design. Reception Productions of The Long Christmas Ride Home have been generally well received by most reviewers. The New York Times, though bemoaning a \\"lag\\" in action as the adult children monologues appear in the latter portion of the play, nonetheless determined the work \\"is as pure as mathematics in its translation of the prosaic into the abstract. At its most touching, the play collapses time and space into moments of disarming, and affecting, beauty.\\"Dewitt, David. \\"THEATER REVIEW; There's Mom and Dad, And a Lot of Problems\\" The New York Times, February 1, 2004 The CurtainUp reviewer wrote: \\"...In deconstructing one family's image of American as apple pie togetherness on the ultimate family holiday, Vogel returns to the central prop d [sic] of How I Learned to Drive and the painful memories of her brother's death from AIDS explored in The Baltimore Waltz. It is also the outgrowth of her interest in fostering experimental theatrical techniques and acknowledging the roots of that experimental spirit. \\"Sommer, Elyse. \\"Curtain Up review. The Long Christmas Ride Home‚Äîa puppet play with actors\\" CurtainUp, October 31, 2003 Critics have compared the work to fellow Pulitzer Prize-winner Thorton Wilder's own automobile journey one-act play, The Happy Journey to Trenton and Camden. Vogel confirms this association as purposeful, labeling her own Christmas work an \\"homage\\" to Wilder's \\"great gift to the American theatre [of] presentational, rather than representational theatre.\\" References External links * * Curtain Up review Category:2003 plays Category:Bunraku Category:Plays by Paula Vogel ","title":"The Long Christmas Ride Home"},{"id":"10682855","text":"Niamat Khel is a Yusufzai subtribe.

Life and career Howison was born in Detroit, Michigan but moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting; with his distinctive long white hair, he was a natural for low-budget horror films, and has since played the character \\"Renfield\\" on four separate occasions (making him the actor who has portrayed this iconic character from Dracula more than any other). In 1995, Howison and wife Sue Duncan started Dark Delicacies, a store devoted entirely to horror books, films and gifts. Dark Delicacies, located in Burbank, California, is dedicated solely to horror. The store has also published a number of charity anthologies, including The Altruistic Alphabet and Conjuring Dark Delicacies (a horror-themed cookbook). In 2005, Howison and co-editor Jeff Gelb published Dark Delicacies: Original Tales of Terror and the Macabre (Carroll and Graf), which included stories by Ray Bradbury, Clive Barker, F. Paul Wilson, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, David J. Schow, Steve Niles, Roberta Lannes, Gahan Wilson, and more. The book went on to win the 2005 Bram Stoker Award for Best Anthology. In January 2019, when Dark Delicacies was forced to relocate, film director Guillermo del Toro backed a fundraising campaign to save the bookstore. In 2007, Howison and co-editor Jeff Gelb published Dark Delicacies II: Fear (Carroll and Graf). In 2008 it was nominated for a Bram Stoker Award and a Shirley Jackson Award for Best Anthology. Howison also co- edited The Book of Lists: Horror with Amy Wallace and Scott Bradley which was released in September 2008 by Harper Collins. Howison has also written a number of non-fiction horror articles and interviews for such publications as Gauntlet and Rue Morgue magazine. In 2008 his short story The Lost Herd (originally published in the erotic horror anthology Hot Blood 12: Strange Bedfellows 2004) was purchased for the television series Fear Itself. It was scripted by Mick Garris and the title changed to Red Snow. The title was once again changed to The Sacrifice and it was directed by Breck Eisner. The episode became the series premiere episode airing on June 5, 2008. His short story The Necrosis Factor was chosen for the anthology Traps which was released in December 2008. In 2010 he co-authored the book Vampires Don't Sleep Alone with Elizabeth Barrial under the pseudonym of D. H. Altair. That year he also released the book When Werewolves Attack under his own name.

The work also served to counter the growing threat posed to Catholicism by the Reformation, which was promoted in Lithuania by the mighty Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family. It was also the first book in Lithuanian to be printed in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

In the Polish preface, Dauk≈°a advocates the promotion of the Lithuanian language in the Grand Duchy and gave a brief definition of the Lithuanian nation and state. The book is regarded as more valuable and important than the Catechism, and constitutes one of the monuments of the Lithuanian language. In his translations, Dauk≈°a used the central High Lithuanian dialect, influenced by both eastern High Lithuanian and Samogitian. As one of pioneers of written Lithuanian, he is credited with the introduction of several neologisms, among them mokytojas (teacher), valia (will), ƒØkvƒópimas (inspiration) and i≈°mintis (wisdom).

It was named for Robert Anderson, who was a Revolutionary War veteran. Although it had been a thriving textile and trading community, it suffered from repeated floods and was bypassed by the railroad. The construction of Lake Hartwell displaced the remnants of the community. Today the nearest incorporated communities are Hartwell, Georgia, across the lake to the southwest, and Anderson, South Carolina, to the North. History The town of Andersonville was settled at the fork of the Seneca River and the Tugaloo River. In 1801, the South Carolina General Assembly established the town. The town was named for Robert Anderson, who was one of the commissioners that laid out the community. The town grew as a trading and textile center. The Southern Clock Company and textile mills were built in the town. In 1840, a flood struck the community and destroyed the textile mills. The textile mills were rebuilt, but they were destroyed by another flood in 1852. The railroads bypassed Andersonville. As rail traffic overtook the river traffic, the town lost its industry and many residents. The Andersonville post office was closed in 1893. The area was largely flooded in the construction of Lake Hartwell. Most of those buried at the cemetery were moved to Andersonville Baptist Church on the eastern shore of the lake. Andersonville Island, which is a narrow island about two miles long, is all that remains of the community.

He was cast in the role primarily because he was an actor with a Screen Actors Guild card, and a qualified firefighter specialist engineer able to drive and operate the fire engine. During the time Emergency! was in production, Stoker was an engineer at LACoFD Station 69 in Topanga Canyon, which is about 20 miles from Universal Studios, where the series was filmed. As an engineer, it was Stoker's responsibility to drive Engine 69 to the scene of the call, and operate Engine 69's pump to provide water to crews fighting the fire ‚Äì exactly as his character did in the television series. Of the main characters, Stoker's was perhaps one of the least seen on camera, ostensibly due to his firefighting shift work schedule. However, he became the production's face for public safety, making several commercials for fire prevention and awareness, mostly shot on the Emergency! set. When Emergency! ended in 1978, Stoker opted to continue in his firefighting career as opposed to acting, eventually achieving the rank of Captain with the LACoFD. Stoker's last assignment was out of Station 106 in Rolling Hills Estates, California prior to his retirement from LACoFD in 1996.

After Parliamentary Election on 9 October 2011 was transformed for two ministries: Ministry of Interior (Minister: Jacek Cichocki) and Ministry of Administration and Digitization (Minister: Micha≈Ç Boni). It was recreated in late 2015. History and function The ministry was founded in 1918 as the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ministerstwo Spraw Wewnƒôtrznych). During a reform of the Polish government in 1996 the administration branch was merged into the Ministry and it was renamed to its current name (on 24 December). That was one of the most important governmental cabinet positions in Poland,It is equivalent to the Interior Ministry of other countries, the Home Office of the United Kingdom, or similar to a combination of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Homeland Security (United States). The ministry was responsible for the following: * The general interior security of the country, with respect to criminal acts or natural catastrophes  including the major law-enforcement forces (see law enforcement in Poland) * the Polish National Police (Policja) * the Polish Border Guard (Stra≈º Graniczna)  Civil defence * the State Fire Brigade (Stra≈º Po≈ºarna) * Search and rescue and the oversight of ambulance services * the granting of identity documents (Polish passports, identity cards) and driving licenses through the network of voivodeships * relations between the central government and local governments (except in the case of regional development, which is undertaken by the Ministry of Regional Development * logistics and organization of political elections, at the national and voivodeship levels (but the results of the elections are overseen by the Supreme Court of Poland)http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/polski/kon1.htm article 101 * regulation of immigration and preventing illegal immigration * integration and registration of legal immigrants While the ministry of the Interior supervises police forces, it does not supervise criminal enquiries; criminal enquiries are conducted under the supervision of the judiciary. The Ministry's headquarters was located on the Stefan Batory Street, south of Warsaw's city centre and the governmental district which surrounds the Belweder. The Ministry could be referred to by its initials 'MSWiA'. The last Minister of the Interior and Administration before it was split in 2011 was Jerzy Miller.

The eponymous Yancy is a popular public figure who is actually a virtual person, created by teams of 'Yance-men'. All aspects of day-to-day life are commentated on by Yancy through advertisements and broadcast shows, from breakfast cereal to music to politics. The populace of the society are essentially being de-politicized and homogenised by the messages of Yancy. All of Yancy's opinions are the least controversial possible; the way his speech is written appears to be profound, yet the content is such that very little is being said.

Other former names for the mountain include \\"Garrycastle\\" and \\"Kilmainham Begg\\" (a reference to Kilmainham Priory which once owned the lands around the mountain). It is high and is the 561st highest mountain in Ireland. It forms part of the group of hills in the Dublin Mountains which comprises Two Rock, Three Rock, Kilmashogue and Tibradden Mountains.Healy, p. 105. The views from the summit encompass Dublin to the north, Two Rock to the east and the Wicklow Mountains to the south and west.Fourwinds, p. 154. The geological composition is mainly granite and the southern slopes are strewn with granite boulders. The summit area is a habitat for heather, furze, gorse and bilberry as well as Sika deer, foxes and badgers. The forestry plantation on the slopes ‚Äì known as the Pine Forest ‚Äì contains Scots pine, Japanese larch, European larch, Sitka spruce, oak and beech. The mountain is also a site of archaeological interest with a prehistoric burial site close to the summit. History =Prehistoric monuments= Close to the summit is a prehistoric burial site. Local tradition associates it, incorrectly, with Niall Gl√∫ndub.Curtis, p. 107. It was excavated in 1849 by members of the Royal Irish Academy who found a stone- lined cist containing a pottery vessel and cremated remains, now preserved by the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin.Healy, p.91.Fourwinds, p. 23. In its present form, the site consists of an open circular chamber in diameter with a narrow passage.Healy, p. 92. For many years, it was believed that this monument was a passage grave and the author Robert Graves refers to it as such in his poetic mythological work The White Goddess (1948).Fourwinds, p. 153. However, conservation work done at the site in 1956 revealed that the chamber and passage were not original features but had probably been created at the time of the original excavation in the nineteenth century.Fourwinds, p. 23-24. A stone bench was also found in the centre, apparently built for the convenience of visitors to the site. It is now accepted that the monument is in fact a chambered cairn with a cist burial at the centre. The site may be the burial place of Br√≥d√°in, after whom the mountain is named.Joyce, p. 135 The monument is not at the summit of the mountain but is located slightly to the north at a position where the view across Dublin Bay to Howth is not obscured by Two Rock. Within the chamber itself lies a stone with a spiral pattern. It became a national monument in 1940.'The Irish Times', Saturday, 9 Nov 1940 O'Connell's Rock. =Other sites of historical interest= The antiquarian Weston St. John Joyce described a rude carving of a cross and a crowned figure with upraised arms on one of the rocks to the south of the summit.Joyce, p. 134-135. This feature was also documented and photographed by the archaeologist Patrick Healy.Healy, Rathfarnham Roads, p. 92-93. Although the cross is in an early Christian style, Joyce and Healy both surmised it and the figure to have been carved at some time in the nineteenth century. Both carvings are still somewhat visible (the figure less so than the cross) but require direct light on the rock. On the southern slopes, along the R116 road is a stone with the inscription, ‚ÄúO'Connell's Rock, 23 July 1823‚Äù. Daniel O'Connell gave an address to the local populace from this rock as they celebrated Garland Sunday that year. The dedication plaque for the Dublin Mountains Way in the Pine Forest. Access and recreation Access to the mountain is possible via the Pine Forest, a Coillte-owned forest recreation area on the slopes of the mountain which is managed by the Dublin Mountains Partnership. Tibradden is also traversed by the Dublin Mountains Way hiking trail that runs between Shankill and Tallaght while the Wicklow Way hiking trail runs to the southeast of the summit. The first part of the Dublin Mountains Way to be completed was the section linking Tibradden, Kilmashogue and Cruagh forests and a dedication plaque marking its opening on 19 June 2009 by Mr √âamon √ì Cu√≠v, T. D., Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs can be found along the route of the Way in the Pine Forest. There is another dedication plaque in the Pine Forest, near the car park, marking the inauguration of the Dublin Mountains Partnership on 24 October 2008 by Mr Eamon Ryan, T. D., Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.

The band consists of Bradford Cox (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Moses Archuleta (drums, electronics, sound treatments), Lockett Pundt (guitar, vocals, keyboards), Josh McKay (bass) and Javier Morales (keyboards, synthesizers, alto saxophone). Founded by Cox and Archuleta, Deerhunter's first stable line- up included guitarist Colin Mee and bass guitarist Justin Bosworth. After recording a split EP with Alphabets, Bosworth died of head injuries, suffered during a skateboarding accident. The band recorded their first studio album, Turn It Up Faggot (2005), with Josh Fauver occupying the vacant role of bass guitarist. Following the album's release, Cox asked childhood friend, Lockett Pundt, to join Deerhunter as a song-writing partner, second guitarist, and occasional lead vocalist. Recorded in two days, the band's follow-up, Cryptograms (2007), combined ambient work and more angular garage rock songs. The release was quickly followed by the EP, Fluorescent Grey. While touring the releases, Mee departed from Deerhunter, due to disagreements over the band's schedule, but rejoined soon after. Deerhunter released two studio albums, Microcastle and Weird Era Cont., in 2008. Both albums were recorded without the participation of Mee, who again departed for a second and final time. The band enlisted former cheerleader and high school friend of Cox, Whitney Petty, as his touring replacement. Recorded as a four-piece with producer Ben H. Allen, the band's fourth studio album, Halcyon Digest (2010), was released to widespread critical acclaim, ranked as Pitchfork's 29th and Stereogum's 78th best album of the decade. In 2012, the departure of long-time bassist Fauver placed the band's future in doubt. Cox, Pundt and Archuleta regrouped with new members, bassist Josh McKay and guitarist Frankie Broyles, to record the primitivist garage rock and musique concr√®te-influenced Monomania (2013). The album expanded on a darker and more disturbing sound, complete with treated tape recordings of rats and insects, exploring themes of disassociation and mental illness. The following year, Cox was struck by a vehicle while walking his dog near his home in Atlanta's Grant Park. During his recovery and rehabilitation he focused on writing songs resulting in the album Fading Frontier (2015). Deerhunter have described themselves as \\"ambient punk,\\" though they incorporate a wide range of genres, including noise, garage rock, art rock, as well as significant pop elements. History =2001‚Äì2005: Formation and Turn It Up Faggot= The band was co-founded in 2001 by vocalist Bradford Cox and drummer and keyboardist Moses Archuleta. The name Deerhunter (Which Cox has repeatedly remarked upon despising) was chosen by the band's first drummer, Dan Walton. Cox didn't care what the band was called as he thought it to be just another temporary art project. The band was joined by Colin Mee, whom Cox met while Mee was living at the Atlanta label Die Slaughterhaus Records with members of Black Lips. The two bonded over a shared interest in Dada and 20th Century Composers Oliver Messiaen and Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, as well as British bands The Fall, The Raincoats, and Cabaret Voltaire. In 2004 the group's first bassist, Justin Bosworth, died of head injuries suffered in a skateboarding accident. He appeared on only one Deerhunter release, the Deerhunter/Alphabets Split, issued before their debut album. Joshua Fauver, of Atlanta punk band Electrosleep International, then took up the position as bassist. Deerhunter's first album, Turn It Up Faggot, was \\"the result of a lot of negativity\\". After the band finished the album, in an indication of how difficult it was to record in the wake of his bandmate's death, Cox said \\"I don't ever want to make this album again\\". The album's liner notes are dedicated to Bosworth. After the release of Turn It Up Faggot, Cox asked his best friend from high school, Lockett Pundt, to join the band. =2005‚Äì2007: Cryptograms and Fluorescent Grey EP= The band, now featuring Pundt's reverb-saturated guitar sound, went on tour, playing shows with the likes of Lightning Bolt and Gang Gang Dance. This tour culminated in a recording session engineered by acclaimed folk musician Samara Lubelski at Rare Book Room, New York City. This session failed to produce anything that could be used, due to Cox's mental and physical state at the time, as well as technical disagreements that emerged with Lubelski. Cox has kept a copy of the sessions on \\"a scratched CD-R under my bed\\" and has stated that \\"nobody will ever hear them\\". In spite of Cox's claim excerpts from those sessions were later posted as a free download on the band's blog. The band returned to the same studio where they recorded their first album outside Athens, Georgia and decided to give recording their second album another attempt. This was partly due to advice received from the band Liars, who encouraged them to re-record it. It took only two days in November 2005 for the band to record their second album, entitled Cryptograms. In 2006, before its release, Pitchfork Media added \\"Spring Hall Convert\\", a song from the record, to its \\"Infinite Mix Tape series\\". The album was released by Kranky in January 2007. The album revealed a more subdued and introverted sound for the band. As with their first album, Cryptograms also had a dedication inside the album's liner notes, this time to a friend of Cox's, Bradley Ira Harris, a heroin addict who died in 2005. On May 8, 2007, the group released the Fluorescent Grey EP, which was recorded in July 2006. The EP featured more use of rudimentary keyboards, bells, and pianos. On August 29, 2007, the group became a quartet with the loss of guitarist Colin Mee. Mee departed because he \\"...couldn't make it to a couple of shows we had booked next weekend and that was unacceptable to certain bandmates\\". Mee rejoined the band four months later, but departed the band for the final time before 2008. =2007‚Äì2009: Microcastle/Weird Era Cont., Rainwater Cassette Exchange EP, and hiatus= Deerhunter contributed the song \\"After Class\\" to Living Bridge, a compilation put together by Rare Book Room Records. The song was recorded in the same place where they attempted to record their second album. They returned to Rare Book Room studios in April 2008 to record \\"Oh, It's Such A Shame,\\" a Jay Reatard cover that would be released as a split single with Reatard himself covering the Fluorescent Grey title track. In the same month they recorded their next album, Microcastle. Prior to the announced release date for the LP, the band continued to tour, with one date opening for The Smashing Pumpkins and a select of fall shows opening for Nine Inch Nails. The quartet's third offering, Microcastle, was set to be released on October 27, 2008, although it became available through peer-to peer networks in late May. In an attempt to reward fans who awaited for the street date, the group reconvened to record a new album of material, Weird Era Cont., which later leaked before its street date also. However, Microcastle did manage to debut at No. 123 on the Billboard 200, a first for Deerhunter. Colin Mee again left the band, to be replaced by a high school friend of Cox's, Whitney Petty. The band enlisted former cheerleader and high school friend of Cox, Whitney Petty, as his touring replacement. While touring the Microcastle album in the UK, Cox booked an evening in a studio and recorded what would become the On Platts Eyott cassette. This was released in two batches of 100 copies each; an edition of pink cassettes was given out to competition winners by his record label and orange cassettes were sold at a special Halloween concert in Atlanta on the 31st of October 2008. In a comment left on the Deerhunter blog on February 28, Cox announced that Whitney Petty was no longer a member of the band, stating: While on tour, the band managed to release Rainwater Cassette Exchange, an EP of songs written during the Microcastle sessions, and \\"Vox Celeste 5,\\" a Sub Pop single of songs from Weird Era Cont. and Microcastle. To promote the releases, they embarked on a short summer trek with No Age and Dan Deacon as the \\"No Deachunter Tour.\\" Later during a performance at All Tomorrow's Parties 2009 Music Festival in September (curated by The Flaming Lips), Bradford Cox announced that the band will be going on hiatus to \\"devote time to some other things,\\" calling the show their last \\"for a long time.\\" During the hiatus, Bradford Cox continued with Atlas Sound and released his second album Logos, Josh Fauver resumed work with his record label Army of Bad Luck, Moses Archuleta enrolled in culinary school, and Lockett Pundt performed some shows in celebration of The Floodlight Collective, his debut album as Lotus Plaza released in March of that year. =2010: Halcyon Digest= In early January, it was revealed that the group would serve as openers on the upcoming Spoon tour to promote their album Transference. Along with the Spoon tour, the group also announced some shows of their own, including stops at the 2010 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, and All Tomorrow's Parties (curated by Simpsons creator, Matt Groening.) During these shows, the band began to debut some new material, including the songs \\"Helicopter,\\" \\"Primitive 3D,\\" \\"Fountain Stairs\\" and \\"Revival,\\" all of which would end up being recorded for their next studio session to follow. In June, Deerhunter took a short break from touring to record Halcyon Digest. Initial news of the album became public when music industry firm, Milk Money, posted a message on their Twitter account that the band had been mixing the new record with Ben Allen (who also worked on Animal Collective's Merriweather Post Pavilion and Fall Be Kind EP.) A week later the band launched a new website, where they announced the title and release date of the LP, along with a guerilla style marketing campaign. The first single, \\"Revival,\\" was made available to fans who had assisted the band with promotion for the new album through a link via official email. In the same month, director John Albrecht posted a trailer for an upcoming live video on his Vimeo page set to be released later in the year. In 2012, it was announced that Deerhunter was to provide an original score to The Curve of Forgotten Things, a short film by the fashion line Rodarte starring Elle Fanning. That same year, bassist Josh Fauver left the band via email in 2012, just prior to the recording of Monomania. =2013‚Äì2014: Monomania= On March 22, 2013, Deerhunter announced their sixth studio album would be released on May 7, 2013. The album, entitled Monomania, was recorded in New York with frequent collaborator and producer Nicolas Vernhes at his Rare Book Room Studio, where Microcastle and Parallax were taped. For Monomania, Josh McKay took over bass duties, and Atlanta native Frankie Broyles was brought in to play guitar. Deerhunter's press release described the record as \\"nocturnal garage\\" while having an avant garde context. On April 2, 2013, the band performed the song \\"Monomania\\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Deerhunter headlined and curated the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival held at Pontins holiday camp in Camber Sands, England from the 21‚Äì23 June 2013. At the event they performed the Cryptograms, Microcastle & Halcyon Digest albums in full, with Atlas Sound also performing. Deerhunter was announced as a headliner at Austin Psych Fest, the 6th annual festival held April 26‚Äì28, 2013, Heineken Primavera Sound (Barcelona), Optimus Primavera Sound (Porto), and perform live at Dancity Festival (Foligno, Italy) along with FYF Fest in Los Angeles during 2015. Deerhunter have also been asked to play at the Meredith Music Festival this December in Victoria, Australia. On December 4, 2014, frontman Bradford Cox was seriously injured and hospitalized after being hit by a car in Atlanta, GA. =2015‚Äì2017: Fading Frontier= On August 16, 2015, Deerhunter released a video for a new song titled \\"Snakeskin,\\" and announced that their new album, Fading Frontier, was released on October 16, 2015, on the 4AD label. The song featured alto saxophonist Zumi Rosow and the video was directed by Valentina Tapia. On 13 October, Deerhunter shared the video for 'Living My Life', dedicated to Miles Davis. The LP was very well received by critics. =2018-present: Double Dream of Spring and Why Hasn‚Äôt Everything Already Disappeared?= In 2018, the band released a cassette-only studio album during their Spring 2018 tour called Double Dream of Spring. A mostly instrumental album, it was made to fill the void until their next album would be released the following year. Deerhunter's eighth album Why Hasn't Everything Already Disappeared? was released on January 18, 2019. The album's first single, \\"Death in Midsummer\\", was released in October 2018 co-produced by Cate Le Bon. Former bass guitarist Joshua Fauver died in November 2018. He was a member of the band from 2004 to 2012. On Halloween 2019, Deerhunter released the 13-minute long single \\"Timebends\\". A separate entity to their eighth studio album, Why Hasn‚Äôt Everything Already Disappeared?, \\"Timebends\\" is a partly- improvised stream-of-consciousness outpouring, recorded live direct to tape and in one take with minimal overdubs and mastered using a completely analogue signal chain. The next day, Cox released the Myths 004 EP in collaboration with Cate Le Bon, recorded in Marfa, Texas as part of an ongoing series with Dev Hynes, Ariel Pink and Connan Mockasin. Musical style and influence The band has revealed many artists and genres that contribute to Deerhunter's sound. The New York Times concert review mentioned \\"the Breeders, Stereolab, disco rhythm, krautrock, Sonic Youth‚Äôs noise breakdowns, girl-group pop, the picked eighth-note bass lines of 1980s indie rock\\", as influences. The song \\"Coronado\\" from Halcyon Digest features saxophone sounds inspired by the Rolling Stones' album Exile on Main St. Cox recalled, \\"I wanted that sax on there because I was listening to the Stones' Exile on Main St reissue a lot...I began to see a pattern forming.

On 30 August 2007 Kaczmarek was detained for 48 hours on allegations of hampering the investigation and submitting false testimonies. Some observers in the Polish press initially regarded this arrest as a political dirty trick intended to silence critics of the Kaczynski government. However, on the press conference on August 31, 2007 prosecutors presented several evidences supporting the charges presented to Kaczmarek. On September 6, 2007, a Warsaw criminal court declared that the August 30 arrest of Kaczmarek was not necessary and irregularly made, although did not undermine the charges against him.

For all but its final , the route lies within Plymouth County. Its southern terminus is at Route 28 at the Rochester‚ÄìWareham town line and its northern terminus is at Route 18 in Weymouth. Along the way it intersect several major highways including Interstate 495 (I-495) in Wareham and U.S. Route 44 (US 44) in Carver. Route description Northbound entering Hanson Route 58 begins at Route 28 on the Rochester‚ÄìWareham town line. The route follows the town line for approximately a tenth of a mile before being wholly in Wareham. It then crosses I-495 before clipping the corner of Middleborough and re-entering Wareham for a short while before finally entering Carver. For the first of this route, none of the town line changes are signed. The route turns northward through the town of Carver, passing Edaville Railroad and the King Richard's Faire grounds as well as the center of town. In North Carver the town intersects U.S. Route 44 just east of where that route becomes a four- lane freeway. Before the freeway was completed, the route had a short concurrency between its current exit ramps to Plymouth Road, where the route continued eastward to Plymouth. Route 58 then passes through the small town of Plympton and into Halifax, where it intersects Route 106. It then passes between the East and West Monponsett Ponds before crossing into Hanson. In Hanson, Route 58 intersects Route 27 before sharing a concurrency with Route 14, passing the Town Hall and Wampatuck Pond before splitting northwestward. The route takes a few turns before entering Whitman, turning northward at a rotary into the town of Abington. It intersects Route 123, the Plymouth/Kingston commuter rail line, and Route 139, all before ending just over the Weymouth town line at Route 18, just west of the former South Weymouth Naval Air Station site. Route history When first established in the late 1920s, Route 58 went from Wareham to Canton ending at Route 138. In Abington, instead of heading straight at the intersection with Route 123, the route went right, running concurrent along Centre Avenue until Spring Street where it turned left and crossed into Weymouth on Union Street. Route 58 then followed what would be the 1931-1959 routing of Route 128 through Weymouth (Columbian Street), Braintree (Columbian Street, Grove Street, Franklin Street, and West Street), Quincy (Blue Hill River Road), Milton (Blue Hill River Road, Hillside Street) and Canton (Royall Street) before ending at Route 138. In 1931, with the establishment of the new path of Route 128 from Dedham to Hingham, Route 58 was truncated back to Main Street in Weymouth continuing its modern path north of Route 123 to end at what is today the intersection with Route 18.Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Road Map of Massachusetts, 1929.

Composition and plot  Gorbunov and Gorchakov is a forty-page long poem. Gorbunov and Gorchakov are patients in a mental asylum near Leningrad. The poem consists of lengthy conversations between these two patients in the Soviet psychiatric prison as well as between each of them separately and the interrogating psychiatrists. The topics vary from the taste of the cabbage served for supper to the meaning of life and Russia's destiny. In Sanna Turoma‚Äôs words, the psychiatric hospital of Gorbunov and Gorchakov as a metaphor of the Soviet State is one example of Brodsky‚Äôs perception of the Kafkaesque absurdity of Soviet surreality. Gorbunov and Gorchakov mirrors the balance that Brodsky struck when he was compelled to weigh the benefits and dangers of psychiatric diagnosis in his dealings with the Soviet state. In the poem, fourteen cantos are named in a such way that the table of contents in Russian language has the rhyming structure of the sonnet: # Gorbunov and Gorchakov # Gorbunov and Gorchakov # Gorbunov in the Night # Gorchakov and the Doctors # A Song in the Third Person # Gorbunov and Gorchakov # Gorbunov and Gorchakov # Gorchakov in the Night # Gorbunov and the Doctors # A Conversation on the Porch # Gorbunov and Gorchakov # Gorbunov and Gorchakov # Conversations about the Sea # Conversation in a Conversation  History  At the very end of 1963, Brodsky was committed for observation to the Kashchenko psychiatric hospital in Moscow where he stayed for several days. A few weeks later, his second hospitalization took place: on 13 February he was arrested in Leningrad and on 18 February the Dzerzhinsky District Court sent him for psychiatric examination to ‚ÄòPryazhka‚Äô (Psychiatric Hospital No. 2Now located on the ) where he spent about three weeks, from 18 February to 13 March. These two stints in psychiatric establishments formed the experience underlying Gorbunov and Gorchakov called by Brodsky ‚Äòan extremely serious work.‚Äô. The poem was written between 1965 and 1968 and published in 1970.  Translations  There are several English translations of the poem including one by Carl Ray Proffer with Assya Kumesky, one by Harry Thomas and one by Alan Myers.

History Sun Yat-Sen established the Republic of China in 1911 using Hong Kong's manhua to circulate anti-Qing propaganda. Some of the manhua that mirrored the early struggles of the transitional political and war periods were The True Record and Renjian Pictorial. By the time the Japanese occupied Hong Kong in 1941, all manhua activities had stopped. With the defeat of the Japanese in 1945, political mayhem between Chinese Nationalists and Communists took place. One of the critical manhua, This Is a Cartoon Era by Renjian Huahui made note of the political backdrop at the time.Wong, Wendy Siuyi. [2002] (2001) Hong Kong Comics: A History of Manhua. Princeton Architectural Press, New York. The turmoil in China continued into the 1950s and 1960s. The rise of Chinese immigration turned Hong Kong into the main manhua-ready market, especially with the baby boom generation of children. The most influential manhua magazine for adults was the 1956 Cartoons World, which fueled the best-selling Uncle Choi. The availability of Japanese and Taiwanese comics challenged the local industry, selling at a pirated bargain price of 10 cents. Manhua like Old Master Q were needed to revitalise the local industry. Actually, the development of Hong Kong's political comics is non-stop, comics artists got the idea based on the political situation in China or Hong Kong.Either pro- communist side or anti-communist side had published the political comics such as Ar-Chung Yen E-king's creations.. Before the 1980s, many newspapers welcome submission of comics strips, because there was a huge competition between different newspapers, newspapers need to reformat usually, this situation brought a big demand of publisher and artists.J.C, Yuan. \\"Interview with Hong Kong Cartoonist Association\\". Hong Kong Comics Hong Kong Story. Hong Kong Arts Centre. Retrieved from http://www.hkmemory.org/comics/index.html#/feature/29 The arrival of television in the 1970s was a changing point. Bruce Lee's films dominated the era and his popularity launched a new wave of Kung Fu manhua. The explicit violence helped sell comic books, and the Government of Hong Kong intervened with the Indecent Publication Law in 1975. Little Rascals was one of the pieces which absorbed all the social changes. The 1995 amendment on the Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance have much influence on the industry. The materials would also bloom in the 1990s with work like McMug and three-part stories like \\"Teddy Boy\\", \\"Portland Street\\" and \\"Red Light District\\". Many famous painters such as Wong Yuk-Long appeared. A comics publishing company, The Jademan (Holdings) Ltd (now Culturecom Holdings Ltd.) Initial public offering in 1986. Chinese translation of Japanese manga are also very popular. Since the 1950s, Hong Kong's manhua market has been separate from that of mainland China. Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty back to China in 1997 may signify a reunification of both markets. Depending on how cultural materials are to be handled, especially via self-censorship, the much larger audience in the mainland can be beneficial to both. Sun Zi's Tactics by Lee Chi Ching won the first International Manga Award in 2007 and Feel 100% by Lau Wan Kit won the second International Manga Award in 2008. Characteristics Modern Chinese-style manhua characteristics is credited to the breakthrough art work of the 1982 Chinese Hero. It had innovative, realistic drawings with details resembling real people. Most manhua work from the 1800s to the 1930s contained characters that appeared serious. The initial start for Hong Kong manhua was based on the inspiration and developments in politics and cartooning in mainland China. The development of Hong Kong manhua not only has a strong tie with China but also followed China's tradition of the involvement of political themes and contents in the cartoon works. The development of mainstream Hong Kong manhua (cartoons) after the war was in the direction of leisure and entertainment reading rather than a serious critique of current events and political situations. The influx of translated Japanese manga of the 1960s, as well as televised anime in Hong Kong also made a significant impression. Unlike manga, manhua comes in full colour with some panels rendered entirely in painting for the single issue format. However, the local manhua of Hong Kong shares cultural values and details with their readers, elements that cannot be found in Japanese manga. For example like the \\"Old master Q\\", the author writes the life of the ordinary people and it turns to be very popular.Mr. Ng Chung Hing 04/09/2009 „ÄäËÄÅÂ§´Â≠êÔºåÂõõÂçÅÂ§öÂπ¥ÁöÑÊÖ£ÊÄßÊî∂Ë¶ñ„Äã(interview) Retrieved fromhttp://www.hkmemory.org/comics/text/index.php?p=home&catId;=6&photoNo;=0 Many of local produced comics are published weekly, and have published for many hundred volumes over many years and have not finished yet.

It is the owner of Justify, winner of the 2018 Triple Crown, along with Super Saver, winner of the 2010 Kentucky Derby; Drosselmeyer, winner of the 2010 Belmont Stakes; and Creator, winner of the 2016 Belmont Stakes. It stands several notable stallions, including Tiznow, Distorted Humor and Pioneerof the Nile, sire of American Pharoah. WinStar Farm won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Owner in 2010 and also won the Outstanding Breeder award in 2016. Background The core of the property was Silver Pool Farm, a farm settled in the late 1700s by the Williams family from the Tidewater area of Virginia, which remained in that family for over 150 years. The area was first surveyed in 1788 and the original Silver Pool farm was settled by Daniel Williams, a descendant of Roger Williams. His wife, Mary, was a relative of Andrew Jackson. The couple were among the founders of the local Baptist Church. Their sons Daniel and John went on to own the Silver Pool property and it was used for raising livestock and for manufacturing products from hemp. John's grandson, Claude S. Williams, also lived there and was known as a successful and \\"locally prominent\\" farmer and stockman. The farm was known to have been owned by the Williams family at least through the 1930s. Several buildings on the property are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The original pond was used as a location for cutting and hauling ice. The NRHP historic portion of the property is part of the Pisgah Rural Historic District and lies mostly along Pisgah Pike road. The conforming structures include the original farmhouse from the settlement period, circa 1784-1790, when Virginia families first moved into the region. It had additions built onto it sometime after the Civil War but retains its historic character. A brick smoke house, tobacco barn that was converted to a horse barn, and the spring-fed, stone-lined pond also are listed. Along a portion of the Pisgah Pike that adjoins the property, a natural hedge of Osage orange has grown so tall that it has become a canopy arching over the road, and is also noted on the NRHP as a historically significant feature. Over time, most of Silver Pool became part of the 400-acre Prestonwood Farm, owned by Houston, Texas oilmen Jack, Art, and J. R. Preston, whose better known horses included Da Hoss and Victory Gallop. In 2000, Kenny Troutt and Bill Casner, both with long-standing interests in horses, came together to purchase Prestonwood, renaming it WinStar Farm. Included in the purchase were the stallions Distorted Humor, still standing at WinStar and the sire of 2003 Kentucky Derby winner Funny Cide, and Kris S.. Over the years, WinStar has steadily grown, incorporating land from the nearby Olsen, Johnson and Kinkead farms, and as of 2016, consists of over housing over 20 stallions, as well as a large broodmare band and facilities for weanlings and yearlings. Breeding shed In 2002, WinStar made its first major stallion acquisition ‚ÄîTiznow, the only two-time winner of the Breeders' Cup Classic, having won that event in 2000 and 2001. Although Tiznow's pedigree was not fashionable, WinStar took a gamble that paid off when Tiznow became the leading freshman sire of 2005. He has ranked among the top thirty sires in North America for many years, and was among the top five sires in 2008 and 2009. He is now developing into a successful sire of sires. Doug Cauthen, brother of jockey Steve Cauthen, was named the first president and CEO of WinStar. In 2005, W. Elliott Walden, who had trained Distorted Humor and several WinStar horses, became vice president and racing manager. In 2010, Troutt and Casner dissolved their partnership, leaving Troutt as the sole owner of WinStar. Later that year, Walden replaced Cauthen as president and CEO. In 2013, WinStar built a new stallion barn that houses 18 stallions, with covered access to two breeding sheds and two viewing areas. There are twenty- two paddocks of 3 acres each in which the stallions are turned out each day. A secondary barn acts as a quarantine area for stallions shuttling to the Southern Hemisphere, and also houses stallions when there is no room for them in the main barn. They also have an extensive training facility for teaching young Thoroughbreds the basics of racing. Graduates of their training program include such notable horses as Songbird and Honor Code. WinStar was a finalist for the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder in 2008. WinStar won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Owner in 2010. WinStar offers an innovative \\"Dream Big\\" program, which offers breeders the opportunity to earn a lifetime breeding right to a young stallion after producing just two live foals from his first books. Troutt said that in the volatile thoroughbred industry, the keys to survival are to not let emotions drive bidding and to always be willing to sell. WinStar Farm won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder of 2016 after leading all North American breeders with earnings of $10,516,427, led by Tourist. Horses bred by WinStar earned 15 graded stakes wins and 239 overall wins in 2016, placing WinStar first in these categories as well.

Career =Early career= Prior to forming his business, Karlan worked as an attorney, first with Covington & Burling and then with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). While at the IRS, Karlan was drafter of federal regulations relating to 401(k) plans. Karlan's published works as an attorney include \\"Differences in Treatment of Employees and Independent Contractors Under Selected State and Federal Statutes,\\" 1998 American Bar Association Section of Taxation Mid-Year Meeting (with Kurt L.P. Lawson) and \\"Cash or Deferred Arrangements, Matching Contributions, and Employee Contributions,\\" 1998 Annual American Law Institute-American Bar Association Conference (with Mary Oppenheimer). =Professionals in the City= Karlan founded Professionals in the City to bring the local professional community together and to familiarize residents with the activities their cities have to offer. On December 31, 2006, when he was simultaneously hosting New Year's Eve Galas at both the French Embassy and the Washington Plaza Hotel, the Washington Post wrote a cover story about Karlan that characterized him as \\"an expert party guy.\\" On December 31, 2007, Karlan hosted the farewell party for the historic Hotel Washington, Washington, D.C.'s oldest continuously operated hotel, the hotel located across the street from the White House. With more than 3,000 attendees, this was the largest party in the history of the Hotel Washington. At the same time, Karlan hosted a second Gala at the Embassy of Italy. In March 2009, the Washington Post published a cover story about how more children of immigrants are seeking partners of the same ethnicity, and how Professionals in the City is catering to this societal change by expanding \\"its repertoire of lectures and wine-tastings over the past year to include 'speed dating' nights for people of Asian, Latino or South Asian descent.\\" This article quoted Karlan as saying that targeting ethnic groups makes sense in the Washington area, which has more than 1 million immigrants. In March 2009, in a feature that also included Oprah Winfrey and Suze Orman, ABC News filmed a Professionals in the City speed dating event where it quoted Karlan as saying that credit score dating websites are a double-edged sword because they enable singles to meet other singles who are preselected for certain financial criteria, but that these sites are unable to avoid the situation of singles still having to find a person to whom they are attracted in the first place.\\" In July 2009, Karlan was featured in a Professionals in the City marketing video promoting its speed dating events, further emphasizing the group's increasing focus on singles. In August 2009, Nikkei Trendy in Japan featured Karlan and his Professionals in the City speed dating events as what is currently trendy in the United States.

It was formed by a group of enthusiasts following a cricket holiday in Malvern. Forty-nine games were arranged in that first season, and the popular cricket festival at Stowe Lane, Colwall, which is still held today, was launched. By the following season there were ten affiliated clubs, by 1934 there were eighty, and by 1938 the number had reached 123. At its peak there were 208 affiliated clubs and 94 school and junior teams. By 1931 the first county associations had been formed, and Durham played a combined Cheshire and Lancashire XI. Four years later the country was divided into five regional associations: East, Midlands, North, South and West. The WCA handed over the running of women's cricket in England to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 1998 and disbanded.

It was hosted by music duo Sam and Mark. The show aims to get one million children to try out new things; literally to \\"do something different\\", also referred in the programme as 'DSD-ing'. A child who completes a DSD is referred to as a 'DSDer'. Premise The idea of the show is to get one million children to do something that they haven't previously tried, by the end of summer 2007. It doesn't matter what activity the viewer chooses to do, as long as it is something 'different' from their normal pastimes and activities. Ideas suggested by the presenters have been incredibly diverse and have included cooking a Spanish Omelette, learning to DJ, taking up a new sport, learning the ukulele, and (somewhat tongue-in cheek) the suggestion to \\"cross breed some lions and puffins\\" to make 'luffins'. Channel and timeslot The 'first run' of the series was transmitted during the UK schools' Easter holidays on BBC Two, as well as on the CBBC Channel. This initial run comprised ten 45 minute episodes. Each episode was first shown at 8 a.m. on BBC Two, with a different episode being shown for each of the ten weekdays of the Easter holidays. The 'second run' of the show began transmission during the UK schools' summer holidays, in the same timeslot. Although it started one week earlier in the time slot 7:15am‚Äì8:00am on BBC TWO Format Each of the Easter and Summer shows contained different 'strands' - *DSD Challenge *My DSD - A different person every time telling you about the hobby they do and how to do it and where you can do it and when you can do it. *Sam Challenge / Mark Challenge *Boys vs Girls *Links Each episode was recorded in a different location within the UK. In the links presenters Sam and Mark would try out a DSD, such as swimming with sharks, trying out the infamous 'cola and mentos' experiment, pigeon racing or racing cars at Silverstone. The DSD Challenges were 18 minute films, divided into three sections. All three parts to a challenge were shown within one episode of the programme. The films followed the journey of a different viewer each episode, who had been challenged to do a specific DSD activity - for example, one child who was a hip-hop street dancer learned to be a ballroom dancer, and took part in a national competition. Some of the children used in the Easter shows were previously 'gamers' on the shows predecessor, Level Up. The Sam and Mark Challenge films were similar to the DSD challenges, but they followed the progress of the two presenters being challenged to DSD. These had five parts, with one part from one of the challenges being shown in each episode of the programme. Sam's challenge was to train to become a stuntman in the US, and take part in a stunt-show. Mark's challenge was to learn hip-hop dancing, and take part in a one on one battle at the UK Hip Hop Dance Championships. The Boys vs Girls segments of the show were presented by Ayesha. In these segments, a group of three boys and a group of three girls would learn a new activity. They would receive training in this activity from a child mentor who had excelled in that field. The activities included golf, pottery, indoor skydiving and playing the xylophone. Once they had received training, the boys and girls would compete against each other. After each team had a go at the activity, the mentor judged which group performed better. A different group of children was featured for each episode. Overall, the girls won during the Easter run, beating the boys 6 - 4. Website The show is heavily dependent upon the website which accompanies the series. The website is divided into a number of sections, including 'How you can DSD', 'Pledge a DSD', and 'Ayesha's Stats'. In the 'Plegde a DSD' section, viewers can suggest 'DSDs' for users to try out, and pledge to do the suggestions. Once a DSD has been pledged, the user can then mark it as completed, once they have tried the activity. Each child who registers on the website adds to the growing total, with the ultimate goal of reaching one million DSDs. The 'Ayesha's Stats' area contains statistics such as the number of DSDs that have been completed, the regions of the UK that have the most DSDers, the most pledged and most popular DSDs.

ANTI ‚Äì Contemporary Art Festival presents site-specific contemporary art covering all artistic forms from sculpture and environmental art to dance, live art and performance. The yearly festival is held in Kuopio, Finland. The first ANTI Festival was organised in 2002 by The Arts Council of Northern Savonia. The ANTI ‚Äì Contemporary Art Festival Association was established in 2005 to coordinate the festival. With an emphasis on performance, ANTI has established itself as Finland's foremost presenter of live art while also showcasing new developments in sonic and visual arts. Site-specific and time based works take place in public spaces, on streets, in office buildings, parks, shopping-centres and other privately owned sites, depending on the festival's theme and the nature of the works. The festival programme consists of artworks created by invited artists and artists selected by an open proposal process. ANTI means ‚Äùgift‚Äù in Finnish. Therefore, it is very appropriate that the artworks which are presented are free of charge. There is a small fee only for the seminars, artists‚Äô talks and workshops. The ANTI Festival wants to make art more accessible for everybody. People who usually don't gravitate towards art may become participant viewers of artworks by chance. 24.9.2013 ANTI ‚Äì Contemporary Art Festival launched a new international art award ANTI Festival International Prize for Live Art which was awarded for the first time in 2014.  Live Art Prize  In 2014 the ANTI festival instigated an International Live Art prize of 30,000 euros The 2014 prize was awarded to Cassils The 2015 prize was awarded to Willoh S.

Main artists of the festival were butch artist Saga Kobayashi from Japan and Live Art artists Eve Dent and Kira O'Reilly from England. 2004 International programme included artists from many countries such as Great Britain, Canada, United States of America, Germany, Japan and Netherlands. During four days there were 17 performances. One of them was Will Kwan's (CA) performative lecture in University of Kuopio which was mentioned in media as well as Jennifer Nelson's (US) and Glen Redpath's (CA) work Prisma Relay. Prisma Relay was held in local super market where it brought running competition and consuming hysteria of Friday afternoon together. 2005 Theme of the year was time. The theme was crystallized by Charles Landry who said: ‚ÄùIt is important that a city does not wipe out its memory‚Äù. 2006 Some place might make you laugh. Some place will make you think. Somewhere you will not find art at all. You will walk through the city with a headset on. You will breath the same air with the artist. Somewhere you perhaps will feel strange pleasure. You will not even dare to enter somewhere. Somewhere you might get shocked. You may discover a slight disorder. There were 17 artists from all over the world giving their performances in Kuopio City Hall, V√§in√∂l√§nniemi Tennis Court, Youth Center 44, Hotel Puijonsarvi, Huuhanm√§ki Observatory, Cinema Maxim, an empty property on Tasavallankatu, balcony of the Carlson department store, Kuopio airport, Savonia University of Applied Sciences, Health Professions Kuopio, an apartment mediated by the real estate agency Huoneistokeskus and the office of Reijo Kela. 2007 For the 2007 edition of the festival a community college, a skateboarding park, the pages of a city newspaper, a late-night grill, a children's playground and an entire island were negotiated by an international program of artists. One of the most attractive works of the year was the vacuum cleaner's One Hundred Thousand Pieces of Possibility where the artist gave away 1000 euros in 1 cent pieces. Claire Blundell Jones's work Introducing Tumbleweed to the Finnish Landscape was also well noticed in media. 2008 For ANTI 2008 Kuopio's residents opened their homes to audiences and host works made for domestic space. Other projects took place in a sports stadium, on a public stage, across the network of city streets and on, and under, the R√∂n√∂ bridge. 2009 In year 2009 the theme of ANTI was walking. For example, Vincent Chevalier (CA) traveled from one place to another walking along a 2-metre length of red carpet by which he gave himself The Red Carpet Treatment. Tim Knowles (UK) in term set off walking and were guided solely by the wind. For this piece he had created a wind vane mounted to a helmet. 2010 This edition of ANTI concentrated on how artists working with writing and language navigate, read and inhabit the city. 2011 2011 was year of celebration since it was 10th ANTI Festival. There were pieces presented by artists from Great Britain, United States, Canada, Belgium and France. In the programme there was for example Blast Theory's Rider Spoke which was a work for cyclists who explored the city by bike, looked for places to hide recorded messages and found digital treasures others have hidden, the choir conducted by Heidi Fast and a balloon piece by Ga√´tan Rusquet. The festival culminated with Mammalian Diving Reflex's The Children's Choice Awards where the only opinions that mattered were those of the kids. 2012 This year the ANTI ‚Äì Contemporary Art Festival programme worked on the themes of man's relationship with nature and the connection between sexuality and the body as well as the natural state of the human body. The festival took over public spaces in Kuopio for the 11th time. And not just in the town ‚Äî the Luonnon ANTI programme set up camp on the island of Karhunsaari as well. A weekend-long artwork and workshop programme were planned especially with children in mind. 2013 As usual, the ANTI Festival offered unexpected encounters in Kuopio and Northern Savonia.

In Cruising for Art about 20 Finnish and international artists made over 800 1-to-1 performances around Kuopio. Also the first PechaKucha night in Kuopio was organized during the festival. 2014 Children and teenagers were in the focus of this year's ANTI ‚Äì Contemporary Art Festival. The international festival programme consisted of work where the youngest family members or youngsters nearing adulthood were either the theme or an active part of the production. This year the first ever ANTI Festival International Prize for Live Art was awarded. Winner of the first prize was Canadian artist Heather Cassils.

Symptoms may include swelling and pain at the site of the tumor, fever, and a bone fracture. The most common areas where it begins are the legs, pelvis, and chest wall. In about 25% of cases, the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis. Complications may include a pleural effusion or paraplegia. The cause of Ewing's sarcoma is unknown. Most cases appear to occur randomly. It is sometimes grouped together with primitive neuroectodermal tumors, in a category known as the Ewing family of tumors. The underlying mechanism often involves a genetic change known as a reciprocal translocation. Diagnosis is based on biopsy of the tumor. Treatment often includes chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and stem cell transplant. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy are being studied. Five year survival is about 70%. A number of factors, however, affect this estimate. James Ewing in 1920 established that the tumor is a distinct type of cancer. It affects about one in a million people per year in the United States. Ewing's sarcoma occurs most often in teenagers and young adults and represents 2% of childhood cancers. Caucasians are affected more often than African Americans or Asians. Males are affected more often than females. Signs and symptoms Distribution of Ewing's sarcoma: Most frequent locations are the large long bones and the pelvis. Ewing's sarcoma is more common in males (1.6 male:1 female) and usually presents in childhood or early adulthood, with a peak between 10 and 20 years of age. It can occur anywhere in the body, but most commonly in the pelvis and proximal long tubular bones, especially around the growth plates. The diaphyses of the femur are the most common sites, followed by the tibia and the humerus. Thirty percent are overtly metastatic at presentation. People usually experience extreme bone pain. Rarely, it can develop in the vagina. Signs and symptoms include intermittent fevers, anemia, leukocytosis, increased sedimentation rate, and other symptoms of inflammatory systemic illness. According to the Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT), the most common symptoms are localized pain, swelling, and sporadic bone pain with variable intensity. The swelling is most likely to be visible if the sarcoma is located on a bone near the surface of the body, but when it occurs in other places deeper in the body, like on the pelvis, it may not be visible. Genetics Genetic exchange between chromosomes can cause cells to become cancerous. Most cases of Ewing's sarcoma (85%) are the result of a translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22, which fuses the EWSR1 gene of chromosome 22 to the FLI1 gene of chromosome 11. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified three susceptibility loci located on chromosomes 1, 10 and 15. A continuative study discovered that the Ewing's sarcoma susceptibility gene EGR2, which is located within the chromosome 10 susceptibility locus, is regulated by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion oncogene via a GGAA-microsatellite. EWS/FLI functions as the master regulator. Other translocations are at t(21;22) and t(7;22). Ewing's sarcoma cells are positive for CD99 and MIC2, and negative for CD45. Diagnosis Micrograph of a metastatic Ewing's sarcoma with the characteristic cytoplasmic clearing on H&E; staining, which was showing to be PAS positive The definitive diagnosis is based on histomorphologic findings, immunohistochemistry and molecular pathology. Ewing's sarcoma is a small-blue-round-cell tumor that typically has a clear cytoplasm on H&E; staining, due to glycogen. The presence of the glycogen can be demonstrated with positive PAS staining and negative PAS diastase staining. The characteristic immunostain is CD99, which diffusely marks the cell membrane. However, as CD99 is not specific for Ewing's sarcoma, several auxiliary immunohistochemical markers can be employed to support the histological diagnosis. Morphologic and immunohistochemical findings are corroborated with an associated chromosomal translocation, of which several occur. The most common translocation, present in about 90% of Ewing sarcoma cases, is t(11;22)(q24;q12), which generates an aberrant transcription factor through fusion of the EWSR1 gene with the FLI1 gene. The pathologic differential diagnosis is the grouping of small-blue-round-cell tumors, which includes lymphoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, and desmoplastic small round cell tumor, among others. =Medical imaging= X-ray of a child with Ewing's sarcoma of the tibia On conventional radiographs, the most common osseous presentation is a permeative lytic lesion with periosteal reaction. The classic description of lamellated or \\"onion-skin\\" type periosteal reaction is often associated with this lesion. Plain films add valuable information in the initial evaluation or screening. The wide zone of transition (e.g. permeative) is the most useful plain film characteristic in differentiation of benign versus aggressive or malignant lytic lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging slice showing Ewing's sarcoma of the left hip (white area shown right) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be routinely used in the work-up of malignant tumors. It will show the full bony and soft tissue extent and relate the tumor to other nearby anatomic structures (e.g. vessels). Gadolinium contrast is not necessary as it does not give additional information over noncontrast studies, though some current researchers argue that dynamic, contrast-enhanced MRI may help determine the amount of necrosis within the tumor, thus help in determining response to treatment prior to surgery. Computed axial tomography (CT) can also be used to define the extraosseous extent of the tumor, especially in the skull, spine, ribs, and pelvis. Both CT and MRI can be used to follow response to radiation and/or chemotherapy. Bone scintigraphy can also be used to follow tumor response to therapy. In the group of malignant small round cell tumors that includes Ewing's sarcoma, bone lymphoma, and small cell osteosarcoma, the cortex may appear almost normal radiographically, while permeative growth occurs throughout the Haversian channels. These tumors may be accompanied by a large soft-tissue mass while almost no bone destruction is visible. The radiographs frequently do not shown any signs of cortical destruction. Radiographically, Ewing's sarcoma presents as \\"moth- eaten\\" destructive radiolucencies of the medulla and erosion of the cortex with expansion. =Differential diagnosis= Other entities with similar clinical presentations include osteomyelitis, osteosarcoma (especially telangiectatic osteosarcoma), and eosinophilic granuloma. Soft-tissue neoplasms such as pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma (malignant fibrous histiocytoma) that erode into adjacent bone may also have a similar appearance. Accumulating evidence suggests that EWSR1-NFATc2 positive sarcomas, which were previously considered to possibly belong to the Ewing family of tumors, differ from Ewing's sarcoma in their genetics, transcriptomes, epigentic and epidemiological profiles, indicating that they might represent a distinct tumor entity. Treatment Almost all people receive multidrug chemotherapy (most often vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide), as well as local disease control with surgery and/or radiation. An aggressive approach is necessary because almost all people with apparently localized disease at the time of diagnosis actually have asymptomatic metastatic disease. The surgical resection may involve limb salvage or amputation. Complete excision at the time of biopsy may be performed if malignancy is confirmed at the time it is examined. Treatment lengths vary depending on location and stage of the disease at diagnosis. Radical chemotherapy may be as short as six treatments at three- week cycles, but most people undergo chemotherapy for 6‚Äì12 months and radiation therapy for 5‚Äì8 weeks. Radiotherapy has been used for localized disease. The tumor has a unique property of being highly sensitive to radiation, sometimes acknowledged by the phrase \\"melting like snow\\", but the main drawback is that it recurs dramatically after some time. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides have been proposed as possible treatment by down- regulating the expression of the oncogenic fusion protein associated with the development of Ewing's sarcoma resulting from the EWS-ETS gene translocation. In addition, the synthetic retinoid derivative fenretinide (4-hydroxy(phenyl)retinamide) has been reported to induce high levels of cell death in Ewing's sarcoma cell lines in vitro and to delay growth of xenografts in in vivo mouse models. In most pediatric cancers including sarcoma, proton beam radiation (also known as proton therapy) delivers an equally effective dose to the tumor with less damage to the surrounding normal tissue compared to photon radiation. Prognosis Staging attempts to distinguish people with localized from those with metastatic disease. Most often, metastases locate to the lungs, bone and/or bone marrow. Less common sites include the central nervous system and lymph nodes. Five-year survival for localized disease is greater than 70% after therapy. Prior to the use of multi-drug chemotherapy, long-term survival was less than 10%. The development of multi-disciplinary therapy with chemotherapy, irradiation, and surgery has increased current long-term survival rates in most clinical centers to greater than 50%. However, some sources state it is 25‚Äì30%. Retrospective research showed that two chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and CXCR7, can be used as molecular prognosis factors. People who express low levels of both chemokine receptors have the highest odds of long-term survival with >90% survival at five years post- diagnosis versus <30% survival at five years for patients with very high expression levels of both receptors. A recent study also suggested a role for SOX2 as an independent prognostic biomarker that can be used to identify patients at high risk for tumor relapse. Epidemiology Ewing's sarcomas represent 16% of primary bone sarcomas. In the United States, they are most common in the second decade of life, with a rate of 0.3 cases per million in children under 3 years of age, and as high as 4.6 cases per million in adolescents aged 15‚Äì19 years. Internationally, the annual incidence rate averages less than 2 cases per million children. In the United Kingdom, an average of six children per year are diagnosed, mainly males in early stages of puberty. Due to the prevalence of diagnosis during teenage years, a link may exist between the onset of puberty and the early stages of this disease, although no research confirms this hypothesis. A grouping of three unrelated teenagers in Wake Forest, North Carolina, have been diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma. All three children were diagnosed in 2011 and all attended the same temporary classroom together while the school underwent renovation. A fourth teenager living nearby was diagnosed in 2009. The odds of this grouping are considered significant. Ewing's sarcoma occurs about 10- to 20-fold more commonly in people of European descent as compared to people from African descent. Ewing's sarcoma is the second most common bone cancer in children and adolescents, with poor prognosis and outcome in ~70% of initial diagnoses and 10‚Äì15% of relapses.

Its formal boundaries are Northcote Road to the west, the Wessex Way (A338) to the north, Ashley Road to the east, and the railway line to the south. Its main road, Holdenhurst Road, was formerly the A338, the main road into Bournemouth from the north and north-east. It has now been bypassed, but it is still one of the main shopping streets and bus routes of Bournemouth. History The original suburb of Springbourne covered and at one time was known as Boscombe Heath. The area gets its name from an old spring that came from near the Windham Road end of Spring Road. The stream then wandered underground to Boscombe Chine and out to sea. Springbourne began its life as a village providing accommodation to craftsmen and artisans employed in the growing town of Bournemouth; many of the cottages they lived in, built in the mid- to late Victorian era, can be seen today in the Northcote and Lytton Road areas. Later came avenues of mainly Edwardian houses, the roads named after US presidents and statesmen, e.g. Garfield Avenue, Washington Avenue. The Cricketers The Cricketers Arms (1867) in Windham Road is one of the oldest pubs in Bournemouth. Originally known as The Cricketers Hotel, it was named after the cricket ground that once existed on land opposite, now the site of the Bournemouth Council depot adjoining the railway line and Southcote Road. The pub's original stables and coach house are still standing and heritage experts reckon the front of the pub was extended a short distance around 1910. The stained glass windows and the bar are thought to date from the same time and, according to stories handed down by regulars, the bar was taken from a cruise ship. Bournemouth-born boxing world champion Freddie Mills lived in nearby Spring Road and used to drink in the Cricketers. Springbourne Library Springbourne Library opened in 1909 and was made possible by its benefactor, Andrew Carnegie, it being one of the many Carnegie libraries, a scheme created by Andrew Carnegie, that involved building 2509 libraries worldwide, 660 of which were built in the UK. Andrew Carnegie started this scheme as a Philanthropist, after retiring from business and selling his steel enterprises to Mr J. P. Morgan for $6 billion. Frederick Abberline was a Chief Inspector for the London Metropolitan Police and was a prominent police figure in the investigation into the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888. He retired to Springbourne - firstly to 4 Methuen Road (demolished, in the 1960s, to make room for Wessex Way), then to \\"Estcourt\\", 195 Holdenhurst Road, where he died in 1930. A plaque commemorating Abberline was unveiled at the latter property on 29 September 2001.https://www.casebook.org/images/Abberline%20Plaque.pdf In 2011 Springbourne Gardens, a pocket park, was opened alongside Springbourne Library.

By spring, water levels begin dropping and by summer, the pond shrinks to half its winter size, leaving a salty residue behind: this accounts for its name, \\"Kealia\\", meaning \\"salt encrusted place\\";Bendure 2005, p. 336. Coastal salt pans once produced the mineral from seawater. The low water levels cause a 98% dieback in the tilapia population, which can produce a foul stench in the area.Nakai 2002. Kealia was once an ancient fishpond supplied with water from the Waikapu Stream in the West Maui Mountains and Kolaloa Gulch originating from HaleakalƒÅ. Native Hawaiians may have raised awa (milkfish, Chanos chanos) and amaama (flathead mullet, Mugil cephalus) using a system of ditches and sluice gates to let nearby fish from MƒÅalaea Beach into the pond. Towards the west, the area between Kealia and the town of MƒÅalaea contains another shallow pond and mudflats that are also used by the birds during the winter and spring flooding. When the mudflats dry out during the summer, the birds move to Kealia Pond. This area was once a runway serving one of Maui's first airports, MƒÅalaea Airport. During World War II, Kealia Pond was used for training the 2nd and 4th Marine Divisions. The site has hosted numerous vagrant birds, most notably Garganey, Curlew Sandpiper, Marbled Godwit, American Avocet, Spotted Sandpiper, and Eared Grebe.

He was a gifted landscape and animal painter and was very successful with his compositions depicting equestrian, animal and market scenes. Life Van Bloemen was born in Antwerp. He was a pupil of Simon Johannes van Douw, according to some historians already from the age of 10. He became a master of the local Guild of Saint Luke in 1674 at the age of 17.Pieter van Bloemen at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He had two younger brothers who were also painters: Jan Frans and Norbert. At some point he travelled to Rome. This possibly happened in the year 1674 or later in the year 1689. He was in 1684 in Lyon in the company of the Dutch painters Adriaen van der Cabel and of Gillis Weenix. His brother Jan Frans joined him in Lyon. Cavalry battle Via Turin, Pieter and Jan Frans travelled on to Rome where in 1688 they were registered in the parish of Sant‚ÄôAndrea delle Fratte.Pieter van Bloemen at Hadrianus In 1690 their third painting brother Norbert joined them in Rome as well. Pieter and Jan Frans made a few trips to Naples, Sicily and Malta. Pieter and Jan Frans also collaborated on works, with Pieter taking on the role of figure painter and Jan Frans painting the landscape (vedute).Metropolitan Museum of Art, Flemish Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 3-4 Pieter became a member of the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists active in Rome. It was common practice in the Bentvueghels to give each member a nickname, the so- called \\"bent name\\". Pieter's bent name was \\"Standaart\\" or in Italian \\"Standardo\\". It is believed he was given this nickname in reference to the standards and banners that he regularly painted in his military subjects.Bloemen, Pieter van, \\"Plundering soldiers\\" at Jean Moust The Temple of Vesta Pieter returned to Antwerp in 1694 and Norbert left for Amsterdam before 1724, while Jan Frans remained in Rome for the rest of his life. Pieter became dean of the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp in 1699. He was the teacher of his younger brothers Jan Frans and Norbert as well as of Peeter van Aken and Frans van Alter. He died in Antwerp. Work A prolific painter, van Bloemen was at his best painting animals, although he also produced a wide range of landscape, genre, equestrian, military and history scenes. He carried on the tradition of Italianizing landscape paintings of the Roman Campagna representing inns, ruins and animals.Hanns Gross, Rome in the Age of Enlightenment: The Post-Tridentine Syndrome and the Ancien R√©gime, Cambridge University Press, 22 Apr, 2004, p. 351 A portion of his output paintings also stand in the tradition of the 'bamboccianti', a group of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists active in Rome whose small works depicted trivial or base subjects.Italian Landscape with Cattle at the Victoria and Albert Museum The Duke of Marlborough and the Earl of Cadogan at the battle of Blenheim He was particularly known for his representations of groups of animals, which he typically placed in the foreground of his compositions and therefore appear as his main centre of interest. Particular features of his style were his depiction of groups of animals as ‚Äòstill-lifes‚Äô in open, Italianate landscapes containing some ancient monuments to convey the ‚ÄòRoman‚Äô atmosphere and the use of lively colouring in the figures‚Äô costumes so as to contrast with the more sombre greys and browns of the herds and ruins.Christine van Mulders and Alain Jacobs. \\"Bloemen, van.\\" Grove Art Online.

The songs and dialog were recorded exclusively for this album. A year later however elements of this album was re-imaged into a television story line for the Sesame Street TV program (episode #900). The album was scripted by Joseph A. Bailey and originally convinced it as a radio program. Bailey also worked on the televised version of the story as well. The album cover is a little misleading as it shows a happy Bert with Ernie at a piano with sheets of music, while Bert, throughout the album, is mostly anything but happy with the situation. The entire album was released on CD for the first time on the 3-disc set Old School: Volume 1, with other Sesame Street albums The Sesame Street Book & Record and Big Bird Sings!  Album's storyline  The album starts out with one of the rare times we hear Bert taking a bath. As he does so, he is heard singing \\"Yankee Doodle.\\" Eventually Ernie comes in and pushes their piano into the bathroom and decides to join in, much to Bert's dismay. He starts playing music, which accompanies Bert singing in protest of the whole thing (\\"I Refuse To Sing Along\\"), with Ernie, in counterpoint, trying to persuade him to sing along. After the song, and just as it seems Bert is going to get Ernie and the piano out, David joins them, followed by Gordon and Bob, then by Luis, Maria and Susan. They would start off by singing \\"I've Been Working on the Railroad\\" then Bob, Luis, Maria, and David would do \\"Old MacDonald Had a Farm.\\" At this point Bert would start asking for a towel, conceding his bath to be over, but is either ignored or turned down by others because they couldn't access one for him. Over the course of side one, various other Muppets (The Count, Grover, Cookie Monster, Herry Monster, Prairie Dawn, etc.) join the sing-along. A couple times during the sing-along, The Count tries to sing \\"Bats in My Belfry,\\" but is justly thrown in the shower. Side two starts with Luis kicking off something called \\"What's the Name of That Song,\\" where everybody, including Bert, contribute trying to guess what it is, but they end the song unsuccessfully. David then does a song called \\"A Very Simple Dance,\\" where he got the whole group involved clapping their hands, stomping their feet, turning around, touching their toes, pulling their ears, flapping their arms, stretching up high, and all falling down. After various antics, at the end of the album, Bert finally sings along with the rest of the cast in \\"Sing.\\" The album ends with \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\" in the distance, as Ernie suddenly remembers he also invited the University of Michigan marching band. At that the door opens and we can hear the band clearer, along with everyone else's sheer delight at their presence, as the album finally fades out.

It is a traditional food and a delicacy of Northern Finland, prepared at springtime. Like jerky, of which kuivaliha is a variant of, its origins lie in the need for food preservation. Kuivaliha is a very useful snack when camping, etc., for its light weight and good nutrition values. It is also used in soup (\\"kuivalihakeitto\\"). Preparation Kuivaliha is prepared outdoors by hanging salted strips of meat in the open air, facing south (for sunshine). Netting is often used to keep birds and other animals away. The drying process takes approximately three weeks. Preparation of kuivaliha is done in March and April, based on specific weather conditions in the Finnish springtime: Ambient temperature above freezing during the day, below-freezing temperatures at night (which prevents insects from contaminating the meat along speeding up the drying process), a dry wind, and sunlight. If the weather is too warm, the meat will rot and if it is too cold, the meat will suffer from \\"freezer burn\\". Kuivaliha cannot be prepared in the traditional fashion in other seasons.

Lady Anne Clifford, 14th Baroness de Clifford, the then owner of Brougham Castle, bought one third part of Brougham Hall in 1654. Amongst other improvements, she re-built the Hall's chapel, St. Wilfrid's, completed about 1659. Lady Anne's attorney-at law and later her steward, James Bird, bought her third of the Hall and manor after her death (1676), being the first person to hold the entirety of the building since the de Broughams.Thomas, 1992, p.10‚Äì14 The male line of the Birds of Brougham family died out, however, and the then owner of the Hall and estate, Thomas Carleton, sold both to John Brougham of Scales in 1726. John Brougham belonged to a separate branch of the old de Brougham family, and was \\"the most successful member of the Brougham family in the 18th century\\", being a Commissioner in the Excise service for England as well as a barrister and local squire.Thomas, 1992, p.17 The oldest part of the hall is the thirteenth- century gateway, followed by the Tudor Hall, which dates back to around 1480‚Äì1520.Thomas, 1992, p.5 The seventeenth-century guardhouse was built by James Bird. The Hall was close to the scene of a bloody battle between the Jacobite army of Prince Charles Edward Stuart and Government forces (the Clifton Moor Skirmish), that took place in December 1745. The rise to power of Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux, led to the Hall being extended and enlarged between 1830 and 1847, to designs by the architect Lewis Nockalls Cottingham. The building works were largely overseen by Henry's brother, William Brougham, 2nd Baron Brougham and Vaux.Thomas, 1992, p.61‚Äì89 From this point on, Brougham Hall received visits from London \\" society\\" and other notable people, including royalty. This culminated in the visit, in 1905, of the King, Edward VII.Thomas, 1992, p.99‚Äì101 However, after World War I, Brougham Hall, in common with many other country houses, faced a severe financial crisis. This was compounded by the spendthrift nature of Victor Brougham, 4th Baron Brougham and Vaux, and his failed attempts to shore up income by becoming a professional gambler.Thomas, 1992, p.117‚Äì126 The hall was sold by Victor, 4th Baron Brougham, attempting to pay his many debts, in 1934, and was thereafter sold again for demolition. From 1941 to 1945, there was a secret tank development facility at Brougham Hall. The project was known as Canal Defence Light (CDL). A plaque at the Hall remembers the men who worked there during the war. There is also a bunker which was used during World War II.Thomas, 1992, p.122‚Äì125 After World War II, the Hall languished in a derelict state until it was purchased by Christopher Terry in 1967. Mr. Terry and his wife, Alison, determined to arrest the further decline of the Hall.Thomas, 1992, p.127‚Äì144 Today, the hall is the subject of a renovation project by volunteers and is open to visitors throughout the year.Renovation project See also *Grade II* listed buildings in Eden District *Listed buildings in Brougham, Cumbria *Brougham Castle ‚Äì a nearby ruined castle References External links *Official site *All Things Brougham *Lake District Walks ‚Äì Brougham Hall Category:Country houses in Cumbria Category:Historic house museums in Cumbria ","title":"Brougham Hall"},{"id":"10684173","text":"On the Prowl is the ninth studio album released by the Japanese heavy metal band Loudness.

He played in the North American Soccer League and coached for thirty years at Philadelphia Textile and UNLV. Player =College and NASL= Barto grew up in Philadelphia where he began playing soccer when eleven years old. He attended Philadelphia Textile where he played on the school's soccer team from 1969 to 1972. He was a two time second team All-American. He graduated with a degree in marketing. That year the North American Soccer League (NASL) held its first college draft and the Montreal Olympique selected Barto in the third round. Despite his low standing in the draft, Barto finished second to Mike Winter for Rookie of the Year. At the end of the season, the Philadelphia Atoms, an NASL expansion franchise, traded for Barto as part of its efforts to create a team dominated by American, and preferably local, players. In 1973, the Atoms took the NASL championship and Barto was selected as an All Star Honorable Mention (third team). Barto remained with the Atoms through the 1976 season, the Atoms last. He then moved to the Fort Lauderdale Strikers where he played in only one game as a defender in 1977. At the end of the season, he retired from playing. By that time, he had already begun his second career, coaching. =National Team= Barto earned sixteen caps with the U.S. national team between 1972 and 1975. He was the captain for most of his games in 1974 and 1975. His first game with the national team came in a 3‚Äì2 loss to Canada on August 20, 1972. He became a regular through 1973 and played both U.S. games in 1974.

A significant portion of the neighborhood lies within the Upper East Side Historic District designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1981 and expanded in 2010. The neighborhood is part of Manhattan Community Board 8. Geography Based on the location of the original Lenox Hill, which was on a farm that spanned present-day 68th Street to 74th Street, east of Fifth Avenue, The Encyclopedia of New York City defines the neighborhood as the area between 60th Street and 77th Street, from Fifth Avenue on the west to Lexington Avenue on the east. (\\"...bounded to the north by East 77th Street, to the east by Lexington Avenue] to the south by East 60th Street, and to the west by Fifth Avenue\\") However, neighborhood boundaries can shift and most residents see the modern boundaries differently, as the Lenox Hill post office and the neighborhood's service-oriented retail shops are located east of Lexington Avenue. Many city maps also place Lenox Hill in the lower east section of the Upper East Side,Manhattan: City Council, Assembly, and State Senate including maps of Manhattan Community District 8 and by the Friends of the Upper East Side.

During human ventilation, air flows because of pressure gradients. Ptp = Palv ‚Äì Pip. Where Ptp is transpulmonary pressure, Palv is alveolar pressure, and Pip is intrapleural pressure. Physiology Since atmospheric pressure is relatively constant, pressure in the lungs must be higher or lower than atmospheric pressure for air to flow between the atmosphere and the alveoli. If 'transpulmonary pressure' = 0 (alveolar pressure = intrapleural pressure), such as when the lungs are removed from the chest cavity or air enters the intrapleural space (a pneumothorax), the lungs collapse as a result of their inherent elastic recoil. Under physiological conditions the transpulmonary pressure is always positive; intrapleural pressure is always negative and relatively large, while alveolar pressure moves from slightly negative to slightly positive as a person breathes. For a given lung volume, the transpulmonary pressure is equal and opposite to the elastic recoil pressure of the lung. The transpulmonary pressure vs Volume curve of inhalation (usually plotted as Volume in function of Pressure) is different from that of exhalation, the difference being described as hysteresis. Lung volume at any given pressure during inhalation is less than the lung volume at any given pressure during exhalation. Measurement Transpulmonary pressure can be measured by placing pressure transducers. The alveolar pressure is estimated by measuring the pressure in the airways while holding one's breath. The intrapleural pressure is estimated by measuring the pressure inside a balloon placed in the esophagus.Ronald B.

Early years Balaban was born in 1877 in the city of Lviv (then known as Lemberg in Austria-Hungary's centre of East Galicia). He received a traditional education at home and traditional Jewish schooling (Hebrew language and Bible study) in a cheder. Biography and initial studies on Jewish history He studied law, philosophy and history at Lviv University. He accidentally encountered materials on the history of Jews in Krak√≥w, and on the request of the Krak√≥w Jewish kahal, he wrote the first volume of \\"The History of Jews in Cracow and Kazimiria 1304-1655\\" (Krak√≥w, 1912). It gave him some reputation in Lviv University. Balaban then won a high ministry scholarship, and departed for a long scientific trip to Pozna≈Ñ, Berlin and Gda≈Ñsk. He stayed for several months in Krak√≥w collecting materials for the second volume of the history of Krak√≥w Jews. Simultaneously he started the publication \\"The history of Jewish system in Poland\\" in \\"Evreiskaia Starina\\" (\\"Jewish Old Times\\", as translated from Russian) magazine. He taught in different schools in the Lviv region and Lviv combining studying with teaching and research. He spent the first year of World War I in Vienna teaching at the gymnasium for Galician refugees. The next three years, he spent in Lublin as a referent (reporter) on Jewish matters by the Austrian General Government. At these posts, he organised many Jewish kahals and gymnasiums. Together with Dr. Ozjasz Thon and Dr. Moses Schorr, Balaban was one of the founders of the Institute of Jewish Sciences in Warsaw. Here Balaban taught Jewish history and led the historical seminar which issued many works on the history of Jews in Poland and in particular in the Polish kingdom. Balaban had also published \\"The history of Jews in Galicia\\" in 1916. Since 1903 Balaban led the review of the bibliography of the history of Jews in Poland in the Polish historical magazine \\"Kwartalnik historyczny\\" (\\"History Quarterly\\"). During nine years Balaban had been administering the Tachkemoni Rabbinical Seminary (1920‚Äì1929) and for 1920-1921 he had been also the rector of the gymnasium \\"Askola\\". The fate of Balaban was also tragic like Schorr's one. He died in the Warsaw ghetto on 26 December 1942. Works on the history of Polish Jews Meir Balaban commemorated in a street's name in Holon, Israel He was the first outstanding historian of Polish Jewry and he is fairly considered as the founder of the historiography of Polish Jews. Among his works the most important ones are: * Jews of Lvov (Lemberg) on the eve of 17th century (1916); * History of Jews of Cracow (2 vols, 1931) * Jewry of Lublin (1919). He wrote also a detailed article about the Vaad of four lands for the 11th volume of \\"History of Jewish people\\". He published hundreds of articles which are devoted to the researches of rabbis', scholars', community leaders' activities as well as the history of bloody pogroms, about the Karaims in Poland and other topics. All they were published mostly in German, Polish or in Yiddish. Balaban's researches written in Hebrew on the history of movements of Shabatai Zwi and Jakob Frank are especially important to note. They are resumed in his book \\"Le toldot ha-tnua ha-frankit\\" (The history of the Frank movement, 2 vols., 1934‚Äì1935). It was published in Tel Aviv. Balaban had written also \\"The history of the progressive synagogue in Lvov\\" (in polish original \\"Historia postƒôpowej synagogi we Lwowie\\") as well as \\"The Bibliography of the history of Jews in Poland during 1900-1930\\" which encompasses more than 10.000 entries. Since 1906 he published many scientific articles in the newspaper \\"Kurjer Lwowski\\". The first more essential essays appeared in the almanac \\"Rocznik ≈ªydowske\\" in 1902-1906: * \\"Izak Nachmanovicz, ≈ªyd Lwowski XVI wieku\\" (Izak Nachmanowicz - a Polish Jew of the 16th Century); * \\"Josefus Flavius, Charakterystyka czlowieka i historyka na tle wspolczesnych wypadkow\\" (Josephus Flavius. A Characterization of a Person and a Historian on the Background of the Contemporary Events, 1904); * \\"Makabeusze\\" (Maccabees, 1905); * \\"Lewko Balaban, burmistrz kahalny Lwowski z konca XVIII wieku\\" (Lewko Balaban (Leo Balaban), the Kahal Burgmeister of Lviv of the End of the 17th Century). Some of these articles became the preparation for the mentioned already Balaban's work entitled \\"≈ªydzi Lwowscy na przelomie XVI i XVII wieku\\" (Jews of Lvov in the break of the 16th and 17th centuries, 1906, 577 pages of the text and 188 pages of the materials). Balaban was awarded the first premium of Ipolit Wawelberg for this work. The work consists of 3 parts. In the first part Balaban depicts the live history of the external events of the community, discussing in details the clamorous deal of Lviv Jews with Jesuits and the eager leaders of the community of the Nachman family; the second part is devoted to the detailed contemplation over the community self- administration and the Rabbinate and the last part consists of a few essays about the trade, crafts, family life, and like that. Balaban used rich archival data of the Archive of Bernardines in Lviv as well as of the Lviv City Archive and the Archive of Jewish Community in Lviv. Memory One of the streets in the downtown of Lviv, Ukraine is named after him (Majer Balaban Street, Lviv). There are also streets named after him in Israel, in Holon for example.

The tip of the anal fin on the male is black, while on the female the fins have less red colouration but darker tips of the pectoral fins.  Distribution, habitat and status  The flame tetra is native to Southeast Brazil, where it occurs in coastal parts of Rio de Janeiro (Guanabara bay region, and Para√≠ba do Sul and Guandu River basins) and S√£o Paulo (upper Tiet√™ River basin). It lives in rivers and streams, generally preferring shallow (less than deep), slow- flowing sections with vegetation and a water temperature from . The species has declined drastically, mainly because of habitat loss, pollution and introduced species (especially tilapia and black bass). Although sometimes reported as extinct in the wild, wild populations survive. In its small remaining distribution, it is common in the Tiet√™ River basin (which possibly is not natural, but introduced) and rare elsewhere. The last confirmed record from Rio de Janeiro is from 1992. The species is listed as endangered in the Brazilian national red list.Brazilian national red list of endangered species Flame tetra \\"orange\\", a selectively-bred captive variant Today large numbers are bred in captivity and it is common in the aquarium trade.

Pure results of a successful purification process are termed isolate. The following list of chemical purification methods should not be considered exhaustive. *Affinity purification purifies proteins by retaining them on a column through their affinity to antibodies, enzymes, or receptors that have been immobilised on the column. *Filtration is a mechanical method to separate solids from liquids or gases by passing the feed stream through a porous sheet such as a cloth or membrane, which retains the solids and allows the liquid to pass through. *Centrifugation is a process that uses an electric motor to spin a vessel of fluid at high speed to make heavier components settle to the bottom of the vessel. *Evaporation removes volatile liquids from non-volatile solutes, which cannot be done through filtration due to the small size of the substances. *Liquid‚Äìliquid extraction removes an impurity or recovers a desired product by dissolving the crude material in a solvent in which other components of the feed material are soluble. *Crystallization separates a product from a liquid feed stream, often in extremely pure form, by cooling the feed stream or adding precipitants that lower the solubility of the desired product so that it forms crystals. The pure solid crystals are then separated from the remaining liquor by filtration or centrifugation. *Recrystallization: In analytical and synthetic chemistry work, purchased reagents of doubtful purity may be recrystallized, e.g. dissolved in a very pure solvent, and then crystallized, and the crystals recovered, in order to improve and/or verify their purity. *Trituration removes highly soluble impurities from usually solid insoluble material by rinsing it with an appropriate solvent. *Adsorption removes a soluble impurity from a feed stream by trapping it on the surface of a solid material, such as activated carbon, that forms strong non-covalent chemical bonds with the impurity. *Chromatography employs continuous adsorption and desorption on a packed bed of a solid to purify multiple components of a single feed stream. In a laboratory setting, mixture of dissolved materials are typically fed using a solvent into a column packed with an appropriate adsorbent, and due to different affinities for solvent (moving phase) versus adsorbent (stationary phase) the components in the original mixture exit the column in the moving phase at different rates, which thus allows to selectively collect desired materials out of the initial mixture. *Smelting produces metals from raw ore, and involves adding chemicals to the ore and heating it up to the melting point of the metal. *Refining is used primarily in the petroleum industry, whereby crude oil is heated and separated into stages according to the condensation points of the various elements. *Distillation, widely used in petroleum refining and in purification of ethanol separates volatile liquids on the basis of their relative volatilities. There are several type of distillation: simple distillation, steam distillation etc. *Water purification combines a number of methods to produce potable or drinking water. *Downstream processing refers to purification of chemicals, pharmaceuticals and food ingredients produced by fermentation or synthesized by plant and animal tissues, for example antibiotics, citric acid, vitamin E, and insulin. *Fractionation refers to a purification strategy in which some relatively inefficient purification method is repeatedly applied to isolate the desired substance in progressively greater purity. *Electrolysis refers to the breakdown of substances using an electric current. This removes impurities in a substance that an electric current is run through *Sublimation is the process of changing of any substance (usually on heating) from a solid to a gas (or from gas to a solid) without passing through liquid phase. In terms of purification - material is heated, often under vacuum, and the vapors of the material are then condensed back to a solid on a cooler surface. The process thus in its essence is similar to distillation, however the material which is condensed on the cooler surface then has to be removed mechanically, thus requiring different laboratory equipment. *Bioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms.

General plan, 1919. The Watertown Arsenal was a major American arsenal located on the northern shore of the Charles River in Watertown, Massachusetts. The site is now registered on the ASCE's List of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks and on the U.S.'s National Register of Historic Places, and it is home to a park, restaurants, mixed use office space, and currently serves as the national headquarters for athenahealth. History The arsenal was established in 1816, on of land, by the United States Army for the receipt, storage, and issuance of ordnance. In this role, it replaced the earlier Charlestown Arsenal. The arsenal's earliest plan incorporated 12 buildings aligned along a north‚Äìsouth axis overlooking the river. Alexander Parris, later designer of Quincy Market, was architect. Buildings included a military store and arsenal, as well as shops and housing for officers and men. All were made of brick with slate roofs in the Federal style, and a high wall enclosed the compound. By 1819 all buildings were completed and occupied. The arsenal's site, duties, and buildings grew gradually until the American Civil War, enlarging beyond the original quadrangle. During the war it greatly expanded to produce field and coastal gun carriages, and the war's impetus led to the quick construction of a large machine shop and smith shop built as contemporary factories, as well as a number of smaller buildings. During the Civil War, a new commander's quarters was commissioned by then-Capt. Thomas J. Rodman, inventor of the Rodman gun. The lavish, , quarters would ultimately become one of the largest commander's quarters on any U.S. military installation. This mansion is now on the National Register of Historic Places. The expense ($63,478.65) was considered wasteful and excessive and drew a stern rebuke from Congress, who then promoted Rodman to Brigadier General and sent him to command Rock Island Arsenal on the frontier in Illinois, where he built an even larger commander's quarters. Activities and new construction at the Watertown Arsenal continued to gradually expand until the early 1890s. Activities changed decisively in 1892 when Congress authorized modernization to gun carriage manufacturing. At this point the arsenal became a manufacturing complex rather than storage depot. A number of major buildings were constructed, which over time began to reflect typical industrial facilities rather than the earlier arsenal styles. In 1897 an additional were purchased, and a hospital built. Scientific management was implemented at the arsenal between 1908 and 1915. It was considered by the War Department as successful in saving money over the alternatives; but it was so hated by the work force that the Congress eventually overturned its use., pp. 138‚Äì141.. During World War I the arsenal nearly tripled in size. Building #311 was then reported to be one of the largest steel-frame structures in the United States, sized to accommodate both very large gun carriages and the equipment used to construct them. Railroad tracks ran throughout the arsenal complex. World War II brought an additional with existing industrial buildings, as the arsenal produced steel artillery pieces. In 1959‚Äì1960, the Horace Hardy Lester Reactor was constructed on site, for material research programs, and operated there until 1970. In 1968 the Army ceased operations at the arsenal; were sold to the Watertown Redevelopment Authority, while the remaining were converted to the United States Army Materials and Mechanics Research Center (AMMRC), renamed the United States Army Materials Technology Laboratory (MTL) in 1985. In 1995 all Army activity ceased and the remainder of the site was converted to civilian use. The Armory site was formerly included on US EPA's National Priorities List of highly contaminated sites, more widely known as Superfund. The site was removed from the NPL in 2006.

The pilots were initially commercial airline employees who flew Ports of Call aircraft in their off time, and later were full-time employees. The flight attendants stayed with each travel club group on a trip for up to a month as group tour guides. As Ports of Call grew, more modern jet aircraft such as the Convair 990, Boeing 707 and Boeing 727 were acquired on the second hand market. By 1986, Ports of Call operated 11 Boeing 707-300 airliners, a B707-100, and a single B727-100 with club membership exceeding 66,000. The club was widely visible from the Ports of Call Travel Club stickers displayed on many automobiles around Denver, throughout Colorado and the surrounding states. One trip in the mid eighties was \\"Around the World\\" and circumnavigated the globe with multiple stops. Another trip was the annual \\"Mystery Trip\\", in which members signed up to be taken on a trip to an unknown destination. This event was so popular, the club would fill multiple B707s with nearly 800 people per trip. Because of federally mandated aircraft noise restrictions, the company went public to raise funding to pay for the required hush kits on the aircraft. In an effort to increase aircraft use, the aircraft began operating as a separate charter company after being rebranded as Skyworld Airlines under FAR part 121, enabling them to operate non-travel club charter services as well. In the wake of public ownership, and after several leadership changes, the company essentially suffered a hostile take over. The new controlling interests liquidated the aircraft assets and shut down the airline portion, remaining open as a travel club sans-aircraft. They sold just one of the B707 aircraft, a \\"combi\\" (having been originally built by Boeing to be easily convertible to a freighter) for over $4 million. The travel club subsequently was forced to book member trips in blocks of seats on commercial airlines. Part of the mystique of the travel club genre of airlines was the enjoyment of special treatment. Instead of club members boarding private aircraft from a terminal, groups were now shuttled to Stapleton terminal to board whatever commercial flights were available to the trip destinations, although they were accompanied by a POC tour guide. With the loss of their own aircraft and the ability to fly directly to any desired destination, they were reduced to offering only the multiple connecting flights available commercially. As a direct result, club membership renewals quickly plummeted and the travel club closed in 1994.

The artists Pan Da-wei (ÊΩòÈÅîÂæÆ), Gao Jian-Fu (È´òÂäçÁà∂), Xie Ying-bo (Ë¨ùËã±‰ºØ), He Jian-shi (‰ΩïÂäçÂ£´) and Zheng Nu-quan (ÈÑ≠Á£äÊ≥â) belonged to the revolutionary Tongmenghui. The work criticized Chinese feudal society along with exposing the corruption and weaknesses of the Qing government. The magazine was banned in 1909 in China, when it was believed to be spreading anti-Qing propaganda. After the ban, the publication resumed temporarily in Hong Kong for a few months the following year. The Qing government later successfully pressured the British Colonial government to also ban the magazine in Hong Kong. In 1912, a few months after Republic of China established, the pictorial was resumed publication in Guangzhou. However, it was ended by a turmoil a year later.

The mines were stowed in two horizontal galleries exiting through the stern. Diving depth was 45 metres. This ship was built by the Naval yard in Nikolayev by the Black Sea (now Mykolaiv, Ukraine). She was ordered in 1908, launched in September 1912 (or early 1913, sources differ) and entered service in 1915. Service Mikhail Nalyotov This submarine fought during World War I in the Black Sea Fleet. She laid several minefields which accounted for the sinking of the Turkish gunboat Isa Reis and the Bulgarian torpedo boat Shumni as well as several merchant ships. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 the boat was captured by the Germans and transferred to the British intervention force who scuttled the boat near Sevastopol to prevent capture by the Bolsheviks.

Festivities begin with a mass at 10:00 am at St Peter's Cathedral. The mass is followed by a 2-mile footrace of the parade route at 11:00, an hour later the parade begins. Each year, thousands of people line the streets of downtown Scranton on Parade Day to take part in one of the city's greatest traditions. The city has hosted a St. Patrick's Day Parade since early in its history, with the current iteration being held annually since 1862. The Parade is sponsored and organized by the St. Patrick's Day Parade Association of Lackawanna County. Attendance for the 2008 parade, which featured appearances by Bertie Ahern, Hillary Clinton, and Andy Buckley of The Office, was estimated to be as high as 150,000 people.

It has also appeared on the United Kingdom Sci-Fi and Space in Canada. The series was developed by Peter Hume, who served as executive producer/show runner and wrote the first and last episodes, among others.  Plot  The series was loosely based on the comic strip of the same name and incorporated elements from several previous adaptations, following the adventures of Steven \\"Flash\\" Gordon (Eric Johnson), a twenty-five-year-old who lives with his mother and whose scientist father was lost in a mysterious accident when Flash was 13 years old. Flash's ex- girlfriend, Dale Arden (Gina Holden), is a television news reporter and is engaged to police detective Joe Wylee. They introduce Gordons' eccentric former assistant, Hans Zarkov (Jody Racicot), when rifts in space appear, allowing travel between Earth and the planet Mongo. Mongo is ruled by the ruthless dictator Ming (John Ralston), who controls \\"Source Water\\", the only source of safe drinking water on Mongo. Unlike the previous adaptations, he is not normally called \\"the Merciless\\" and is instead called \\"Benevolent Father\\", though he is still called \\"the Merciless\\" in closed circles. He also exhibits the traits of modern, media-savvy dictators, rather than the more simplistic, stereotypically evil characterization of earlier incarnations.Sci-Fi Channel. June 29, 2007. http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=2&id;=42218 Also, unlike previous depictions, Ming resembles a blond Caucasian human, rather than a bald East Asian man. Ming has a daughter, Princess Aura (Anna van Hooft), who is disturbed by her father's brutality. The series adds a new non-Terran character, Baylin (Karen Cliche), a bounty hunter from Mongo. She finds herself trapped on Earth and becomes a comrade of Flash, Dale and Zarkov and their guide to Mongo and its inhabitants. The peoples of Mongo live in \\"cantons\\", tribal groups that echo the animal-human hybrids of the original comic strip. The cantons include the Verdan (based on Prince Barin's forest- dwelling people from the strip), the Turin (based on the strip's Lion Men), the Dactyls (the series' version of the strip's Hawkmen), the Omadrians (women who create powerful medicines), the Frigians (who live in the frozen wastelands), the Tritons (who live beneath the ocean), and the Zurn (painted blue \\"Magic Men\\" led by Queen Azura). There is also another group known as the Deviates, mutants whose ancestors drank \\"Grey Water\\" (toxic water) to survive. The Deviates are led by Terek, their unofficial king (and Aura's brother) and are distrusted by almost everyone.

Puran and Susanna Bair were disciples of Inayat Khan‚Äôs eldest son and successor Vilayat Inayat Khan.‚ÄúHazrat Inayat Library‚Äù The HRM founders claim that their approach is non-religious, practical, and scientific.‚ÄúThe Institute for Applied Meditation‚Äù Techniques The method was described in the 1998 book Living from the Heart, by Puran Bair (2nd Edition Published in 2009) and in the 2007 book Energize Your Heart in 4 Dimensions, by Puran and Susanna Bair. The method of HRM involves conscious breathing, use of the full lung capacity, a concentration on the heart (both the physical heart and the emotional or poetic heart) and an intervention in the breath to make it rhythmic, through the coordination of the breath and heartbeat. \\"The Full Breath\\" technique expands the vital capacity of the lungs with full and deep breathing, while slowing the breath rate to six breaths per minute or slower. This synchronizes breath and heartbeat, creating ‚Äúentrainment,‚Äù a coherent pattern of Heart Rate Variability. Entrainment also decreases production of stress hormones and increases production of anti- stress hormones. Another pattern, ‚ÄúThe Square Breath‚Äù, involves a longer holding of the breath, so that the holding period equals the breathing period, for example, 8 beats in, 16 beats hold, 8 beats out. The \\"Square Breath\\" method is applied for stabilizing quality of breathing in order to reduce anxiety or feelings of panic. Research studies completed by the Heart Math Institute indicate that this sort of entrainment increases parasympathetic nervous system activity, associated with a calm, restful state.

Although the band itself did not gain widespread success, the musicians did go on to conduct successful musical careers. The band featured Simon King (drums) and for a short time, Lemmy, who later joined Hawkwind. Further members were Robert \\"Robbie\\" Milne (lead guitar), Allan Love (lead vocals), Richard Bardey (bass), and Tommy Doherty (rhythm guitar). The band released three official singles of the heavy psychedelic rock style before disbanding. History Before becoming Opal Butterfly, the group was known as Cardboard Heaven They were formed in 1967 in Oxfordshire. Their original lineup consisted of Roger Warner (bass) Robbie Milne (lead guitar) 17-year-old Simon King (drums) Alan Cobb (keyboards) and vocals shared by Stuart Thornhill and Denny Sutcliffe. Locally, they performed at clubs and dance halls with a repertoire of R&B; and blues standards. Even though the group garnered a considerable following, Simon King would leave the group to form Opal Butterfly. =Opal Butterfly = Later in the year Simon King formed his new band and recruited Milne on Guitar. The remaining lineup were associates of the two and included Allan Love (vocals) Richard Bardey (bass) Tom Doherty (guitar) Regarding the name, Doherty stated \\"Butterfly by itself was a bit dull, so we thought of something more colorful\\". The group began recording demos and received the interest of CBS Records. These included covers of \\"I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)\\" and \\"Wind Up Toys\\", both tracks by The Electric Prunes. In 1968, the band released their first official recording \\"Beautiful Beige\\"/\\"Speak Up\\" which was described as a solid piece of harmonial psychedelic pop, but made no impactful gains. The group's most notable recordings came in 1969 with an organ-backed remake of The Who composition \\"Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand\\" with the B-side being \\"My Gration Or?\\". Despite radio play, the single only gained them local support and the band would revamp its lineup and change labels to Polydor. Most notably, the band acquired Lemmy Kilmister. Kilmister met the band at a shop called The Chelsea Drug Store located in the Kings Rd Chelsea. He started a friendship with King who then asked him to join, and Kilmister would be a member until the group's decision to kick him a few months later. With the new label, the new lineup released a single, \\"Groupie Girl\\"/\\"The Gigging Song\\". For this final effort, the band returned to its roots as the songs were more blues influenced in nature. However, the single caused a slight uproar when the cover featured a nude woman and radio stations refused to play the single. Throughout 1969 into 1970 the band initiated a tour in Britain for sets of 90 minutes. They appeared in the Derek Ford film, Groupie Girl (1970), as \\"Sweaty Betty\\". Lemmy did not contribute to any recordings or the film. One last line- up change was formed but did not change the band's fortunes and they broke up in 1970. Kilmister and King would cooperate once again in Hawkwind. In the meantime, Milne formed another Opal Butterfly line-up with replacement musicians, namely Ray Owen (vocals) David O'List (guitar), Stan Decker (bass) and Mike Burchett (drums) but this line-up only lasted a short while. Doherty and King formed their own version of Opal Butterfly and were not too pleased of Milne forming his own version, so in 1969 Milne joined the 'New Look Soul Band' who were later to become Fine China.

'USTAD DAMAN--THE PEOPLE'S POET By Dr. Afzal Mirza published 10 May 2006, Retrieved 2 July 2018 He was introduced into politics by Mian Iftikharuddin, a left-leaning politician, member of the Pakistan Movement and owner of Pakistan Times, a major newspaper in Lahore, Pakistan.  Life  Ustad Daman was introduced originally as part of the struggle for independence from British rule. A tailor by profession, in 1930, he stitched a suit for Iftikharuddin, who got impressed by his inspiring poetry verse, when the two met each other at his shop. He invited Ustad Daman to recite his poem at a public meeting organised by the Indian National Congress, where Ustad Daman became an instant hit. Pandit Nehru, who was present at that public meeting, dubbed him the ‚ÄòPoet of Freedom‚Äô after listening to his revolutionary anti-imperialist poetry.Ustad Daman interviewed by writers Munnu Bhai and Karam Nawaz in 1974 Uploaded 11 Dec 2011, Retrieved 2 July 2018 At the time of 1947 Partition of British India, his shop and house were burned down by rioting mobs and his wife and young daughter were killed. However, Ustad Daman decided to stay in Lahore and the newly created country of Pakistan. He remained, throughout his life, a fierce opponent of dictatorship, civilian or military, and all corruption and hypocrisy. His work and poetry were published as 'Daman dey Moti' after his death by his devoted followers and admirers. The poems he wrote are still widely quoted in the Punjab as well as in other regions of Pakistan.Profile and books of Ustad Daman on books.google.com website Retrieved 2 July 2018 He first wrote under the pen name \\"Humdam\\", which he later changed to \\"Daman\\". The title \\"Ustad\\" (meaning teacher or expert) was bestowed on him by the local people. After that he became a regular participant in political public meetings. He believed that the unity of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs was essential, if the struggle for freedom from the British, was to be carried on successfully. Songs in films The following poems of Ustad Daman were used in Pakistani films: * \\"Bach jaa mundia maurr taun, mein sadqey teri tore taun\\" Sung by Noor Jehan, lyrics by Ustad Daman and music by Feroz Nizami, film Chan Wey (1951)Ustad Daman's film song on mpaop.org website Retrieved 2 July 2018 * \\"Changa banaya aee sahnun khidona\\" Sung by Noor Jehan, lyrics by Ustad Daman, music by Feroz Nizami, film Chan Wey (1951)film Chan Wey (1951) on IMDb website Retrieved 2 July 2018 * \\"Na mein sonay jai na Chandi jai mein pittal bhari paraat, meinun dharti qali kara de, mein nachhaan sari raat\\" Sung by Humaira Channa, lyrics by Ustad Daman, music by Kaalay Khan, a PTV, Lahore production. Death and legacy Veteran Pakistani film actor Allauddin used to visit him frequently in his one-room-residence in Lahore near Anarkali Bazaar. He had a lot of respect for Ustad Daman and treated him like a father-figure. Ustad Daman used to call him 'my adopted son'.

It was an analog semi- satellite of CBNT-DT, the CBC owned and operated station in St. John's. Until 1985, it produced limited amounts of local programming. The station was founded by the Iron Ore Company of Canada Aviation, Ltd, and was co-owned with nearby sister station CFKL-TV in Schefferville, Quebec (which later became repeater CBSET-1, which repeated CBMT Montreal). History =1970s= On July 28, 1970, the licences for the two stations (CJCL-TV and CFKL-TV) were renewed for only two years. The Iron Ore Company of Canada Aviation, Limited was considered ineligible to hold a broadcast television station licence, as 60% of the company's shares were owned by American companies. Although both stations were private CBC affiliates, they aired the whole CBC schedule on videotape. At the time, both stations were bilingual (English and French), with 73% of their programming in English, and the other 27% in French. Since it was considered very unlikely another company would be willing to buy these stations, their licences were renewed temporarily under the existing ownership. On March 30, 1973, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was given approval to purchase CJCL and CFKL. CJCL would continue to operate as it did when it was a private affiliate: on channel 13, with an effective radiated power of 214 watts (video), and 43 watts audio, using a directional antenna. Full CBC network programming would now be received via satellite transmissions, instead of having videotapes flown in. CJCL became CBNLT. =1980s= In 1985, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) considered an application to amend CBNLT's licence so it could receive all of its programming directly from CBNT in St. John's. This would relieve CBNLT of its requirement to provide local programming (such as news segments) for Labrador City. In the application, the CBC told the CRTC that it would close CBNLT's local studio to save money, effective March 31, 1985. This meant the station would cease production of its local public affairs and information programming, which aired 15 minutes per day, Monday to Friday. This programming had aired for over 10 years, and was inserted in the provincial weekday evening news program Here and Now. This closure also resulted in the elimination of roughly 230 minutes per week of public service announcements. The CBC had proposed that a news reporter supported by a technical crew would prepare news stories regarding Labrador City and Western Labrador, and send the tapes directly to CBNT in St. John's (the master control facilities), where the program editor would select which material would be broadcast. The CRTC had expressed serious concerns the following year that the CBC had discontinued the production of 75 minutes of local live television programming in Labrador City, as of March 31, 1985, without prior notification to the community of Labrador City, or authorization from the CRTC. Due to budget cuts, it was agreed that it would be unreasonable to expect the CBC to reinstate completely the former level of local origination at CBNLT. The station was told, however, to continue to originate programming from Labrador City. The CRTC maintained that the programs broadcast by CBNLT and CBNLT-1 (its broadcast translator in Churchill Falls on Channel 9, at 0.0089 kW) be received from studios located at Labrador City. In 1987, the CBC had notified the CRTC that it intended to introduce regular weekday local newscasts on CBNLT as of August 4. On September 13, 1988, CBMRT (Channel 9, 0.089 kW) in Fermont, Quebec was authorized to change its program source from CBMT in Montreal to CBNLT in Labrador City. =1990s= On February 22, 1991, CBNLT-1 in Churchill Falls was authorized to change its program source from CBNLT Labrador City, to the CBC Television network feed received via satellite. It would also air local programs produced by CBNT St. John's. The CBC indicated the change was necessary because the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway Company Inc. would abandon its microwave facilities on February 9. These facilities provided the feed to Churchill Falls. Also on this date, CBNLT Labrador City and CFLA-TV Goose Bay (which also serves Happy Valley) became rebroadcasting transmitters of CBNT. =Closure of CBNLT= Due to budget cuts handed down on the CBC in April 2012, the CBC has announced several austerity measures to keep the corporation solvent and in operation; this included the closure of the CBC and Radio-Canada's remaining analog transmitters, including CBNLT and CBNLT-1, which occurred on July 31, 2012.CBC/Radio-Canada Speech Transcript: \\"Speaking notes for Hubert T.

After the fall of the eastern parts of the Empire under Byzantine occupation in 971, he and his brothers David, Aron and Samuel continued the fight to the west. They ruled together and divided the realm into four parts. His lands were centred on Strumitsa, from where he had to launch attacks against the Aegean regions of the Byzantine Empire. In 976 the Bulgarian armies undertook a major assault from all borders and Moses lead his troops to Serres. During the siege of the town, he was mortally hit by a stone and then slain by an enemy sword. David and Aron also perished in the same year and the whole power fell in the hands of Samuel, who became Emperor in 997 after the death of last ruler from the previous dynasty, Roman.

The comic is considered a creative break away from traditional lianhuanhua. The story was able to adjust with the different time periods and make changes associated with social issues.Wong, Wendy Siuyi. [2002] (2001) Hong Kong Comics: A History of Manhua. Princeton Architectural Press. New York. It is also one of the most successful comic to come out prior to the arrival of television broadcasts. The popularity only faded when the story became over the top with laser guns, spy gadgets and non traditional weapons, which turned off some readers. Story The comic began more or less as a comedy. Eventually the story developed into a focus against the Japanese occupation and the plot became more serious. The character Uncle Choi became a war hero. Format Some of the titles read from left to right, while others read from right to left. The book was different in size at 5x7, instead of 3.6 x 5 inches.

O. Mebes (Gregory Ottonovich M—ëbes, 1868 (Riga, Latvia) - 1930(Ust-Sysolsk, Russia)), was a leader of Russian Freemasonry, Grand Lodge \\"Astraea\\"Freemasonry, with more than 200 years of existence at that time, and the founder of ‚ÄòThe Initiation School of Western Esoterism‚Äô. In his external life, he occupied the position of professor of French and Mathematics in two of the best schools in Saint Petersburg. He was appreciated and well known among the members of the society in the capital city. However, very few knew of his School. Only those who were invited by him were allowed into the School. Initiation School of Western Esoterism The School had an ‚Äòexternal circle‚Äô, attended by all of his students, as well as some ‚Äòinternal groups‚Äô formed accordingly to the evolutionary level of the disciples, their individual aspirations and capabilities. In 1912, foreseeing what perhaps was the storm about to reach Russia, G. O. Mebes agreed that his disciples publish the lessons about the 22 Major Arcana of Tarot. The book came out under the title of The Course of Encyclopedia of Occultism, which was completely justified because through the explanation of the Arcana, which are faces of the Truth, he introduced all of the ramifications and aspects of occultism. The first edition was quickly sold out. In late 1917, when the new soviet regime started to persecute religion and spiritualism, the School of G.O. Mebes became clandestine, but its works never stopped. In 1926, due to imprudence of one of the students, the School and the domicile of its members were invaded by soviet authorities, the documents destroyed and those who were linked the School were arrested. G. O. Mebes was deported to a gulag in the Solovetsk islands, in the White Sea, sub-Arctic region. He died a few years later. Legacy In 1937, the Encyclopedia was considered as a classic of occultism, it was again published in Shanghai, China. Before that, in the second decade, in Tallinn, Estonia, the Russian theosopher Catarina Sreznewska-Zelenzeff, who was getting ready to leave Europe and move to Brazil, received from her friend, Nina Rudnikoff, disciple of G. O. Mebes, a precious material about the Minor Arcana of Tarot. Nina, escaping from Russia, saved all her notes taken during her studies at the School. Having known that Catarina was going to travel to Brazil, Nina gave her the notes taken from the lessons that had been ministered by Mebes to the internal circle groups of the School. She also asked her to transfer her notes to ‚Äòsomeone dignified‚Äô, asking her that take that with her and, eventually, transfer the material to someone else ‚Äòdignified‚Äô so that the lessons could be preserved. Years later, in Brazil, in a very strange coincidence, Catarina met Nadia, widow of Gabriel Iellatchitch, another disciple and great friend of Mebes. Both ladies decided to live together. Right after that, Nadia‚Äôs brother, Alexandre Nikitin- Nevelskoy, who had a profound knowledge of esoterism and was also a follower of Mebes‚Äô School, came from Chile to live with them. By putting his notes together and with the help of the two ladies, Alexandre reestablished the course of the Minor Arcana of Tarot in its entirety. Therefore, Nina‚Äôs wish came true because the material was safe and not only transmitted to ‚Äòsomeone dignified‚Äô but also organized by someone competent, who belonged to the same egregoric (see egregore) chain. This allowed the work to be translated to Portuguese. Some of the copies of the Encyclopedia reached Brazil and were translated by Marta P√©cher,clube do taro (in Portuguese) who was deeply impressed by the content of the book. She also tried to reach contact with old disciples of Mebes, and finally knew one of his direct disciples, who died in Chile. With some help, she began the translation to Portuguese and published the book under the title Os arcanos Maiores do Tar√¥ (The Major Arcana of Tarot). This book was edited by Editora Pensamento, in Brazil. Following the symbolism he explains in his book, some tarot cards have been created.Green Door--flagged as possibly infected as of 20 Nov 2014 These cards are very rich in symbolism, as Mebes knew Kabbalah as well as the numeric meaning of every arcana. A new English translation of the Tarot Majors course was published on February 8 2020 by Shin Publications, incorporating notes from Meditations on the Tarot at the end of each Arcana. Influences Mebes' work also influenced the writer Mouni Sadhu, who admitted that his own book, The Tarot, was based on that of Mebes,Sadhu, M, 1962, The Tarot. and the M√©ditations sur les 22 arcanes majeurs du Tarot of Valentin TombergM√©ditations sur les 22 arcanes majeurs du Tarot (a study of the Tarot of Marseilles) published anonymously in French in 1980 (with a foreword by a Catholic theologian and priest, Hans Urs von Balthasar).

He was part of the expedition of the Virginia Company of Plymouth which established the short- lived Popham Colony, also called \\"Northern Virginia.\\" Popham Colony Davis was master of the ship Mary & John which sailed to the New World to the coast of Maine. He is believed to be the author of an account of this voyage entitled, The Relation of a Voyage into New England begun from the Lizard, ye first of June, 1607.Captain James Davis, 1580 - 1623 at davisbeantrees.home.comcast.net He was the commander of the fort built on the Kennebec River, August 19, 1607, by the Sagadahoc New England Colony (the colony was made up of knights and gentlemen from Bristol). The short-lived colony built its fort and log buildings near present-day Phippsburg, Maine in August 1607. The Virginia, a pinnace was also constructed to demonstrate shipbuilding potential of the new colony. When the Popham Colony closed in 1608 due to the severity of the winter, the Virginia was one of the vessels to carry the surviving colonists back to England, probably sailed by Davis. Jamestown Colony Records suggest that Davis and Virginia made at least one other Atlantic crossing, from England to the more successful Jamestown Settlement, a project of the Virginia Company of London. Virginia was apparently one of the two pinnaces in tow behind one of the larger ships of the Third Supply mission to Jamestown, which left Plymouth in 1609. They encountered a 3-day storm thought to have been a hurricane, resulting in the shipwreck of the flagship of the fleet, the Sea Venture, on Bermuda. Virginia survived the storm, and under the command of Davis (accompanied by his wife Rachel), arrived in the Colony on 3 October 1609. A possible brother, Robert, migrated to Virginia with Davis as well. At that time, Davis assumed command of Fort Algernon at Point Comfort, where he survived the Starving Time of 1609-10. Davis was a councilor for the north Virginia Colony. Virginia become a safe refuge when Indian hostilities erupted. She was also used to go inland to relieve Fort Algernon and attempt trade with the Powhatan confederacy. During this trip, Davis decapitated two Indians and left their mutilated bodies near the fort. On yet another inland foray, he destroyed a Powhatan village, burnt their corn and killed all men, women and children. Davis was soon in command of three forts. Subsequent career Mention of Davis continued. He is noted as commanding colonists at Henrico, Virginia in 1616. Most writers concur that Davis left his post in charge of the forts at Coxendale, near the present fort site of Henricus, and sailed for England aboard the ship \\"Treasurer\\", commanded by Samuel Argall in 1616. It is noteworthy that John Rolfe and Pocahontas were also aboard. And it is likely that he returned to Virginia in 1617 aboard the \\"George\\"; this is suggested by the fact that his son Thomas was deeded land in Virginia some years later for head rights accrued for two indentured servants whose passage he paid for on the 'George' that year.

Some sources believe Davis was among those killed (or wounded) in the Indian Massacre of 1622 along the James River when 350 people (or one-third of the population) were killed. However, his name is not listed on official lists of the victims of the Virginia Company. Other records indicate that he died on February 16, 1623 at his plantation in Virginia. However, there are also others who believe that he may have lived as much as 10 years longer.

It was largely unknown outside of the south-east of County Galway, where the village of Creachmhaoil is also found, until the latter end of the 19th century when emigres established branches of the family which still thrive in Newfoundland, Bermuda,A Bermuda Family Tree: Crockwell Cornwall, Ohio and Berkshire County, Massachusetts, among other places. The surname was found in Barbados in the 19th Century, having evidently arrived in the 17th Century (probably as part of the involuntary Irish immigration to Barbados that followed the Cromwellian invasion of Ireland),Global Irish: Government to help Irish in Barbados? but is now extinct there, possibly as a result of re-emigration (the Crockwells of Bermuda descend from a single white Barbadian who settled there in the 19th Century). Documentation on the origin of the surname is not recorded, but it is doubtless connected to the village. √ì, in Irish surnames, indicates a grandson or descendant of the person whose given name it precedes (as in √ì Briain: grandson of Brian). Creachmhaoil is not used as a given name in Ireland, and is actually a toponym, composed of two Gaelic words. Creach, which is related to craig, and creag, and the English word crag, refers to a rock (with which word it rhymes), or the bare rock crest of a hill (related words are cruach, for a mountain, pinnacle, or a rounded hill that stands apart...or for any type of pile, or heap, and 'cnoc', for a hill or eminence). An alternate etymology of creach is plunder, presumably in reference to herds of cattle, which were often targets of thefts and cattle raids amongst the Gaels. The usual Gaelic word for cattle is crodh, often Anglicised in place- names as crow, although the words cro, crocharsach, and cr√≤ are all connected with sheep, sheep enclosures or meadows. A maol is a round-shaped hill or mountain, bare of trees. It is anglicised as mull, and is common in Irish and Scottish place names such as the Mull of Kintyre. Gaelic spelling rules require that maol, following creach, be lenited; that is, an h is inserted after the first letter, providing the first letter is a consonant (and not an l, n, or r). This h makes the preceding consonant silent, or changes its sound (mh, or bh, for instance, are silent or sound like an English v or w). Gaelic spelling rules also require that, with the first letter lenited, the last vowel should be slender (an i, or an e). As both vowels in maol are broad (a, o, u), an i is inserted after. These two changes alter the sound of maol (rhymes with mull) to mhaoil (rhymes with uell, or well). The sound of the two word together, therefore, sounds to an English ear like Crockwell, or Craughwell, and it is Anglicised thus (the Gaelic personal names Se√°n (John) and Seamus (James) became Iain and Hamish in Scotland by similar means). The complete toponym is used, today, to connote the village in Galway, but presumably was adopted from a nearby hill. The village is too small to have been known far afield, and the surname is largely restricted in Ireland to County Galway. √ì Creachmhaoil, therefore, is presumably a Toponymic surname adopted by villagers from Creachmhaoil upon their moving to other parts of Galway.

However, the main annalistic section of some manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle omit any mention of Creoda, and describe Cynric as the son of Cerdic. If he existed he may have ruled Wessex for a short period of time immediately after Cerdic's death. Conflicting theories If the historical existence of Creoda is admitted, there are a number of theories as to his identity and why he appears in some primary sources, but not others. # His inclusion in the genealogies was original, and his name was removed from some lists at a late date for dynastic and political reasons.Walker, p. 185 # He was a contemporary of Cerdic and Cynric, but ruled the Thames Valley Saxons, while they ruled the Hampshire Saxons.

Despite everyone's efforts to keep the news a secret, Steve's brother Nick found out that the pair was dating and suspecting that Steve was only after Betsy's trust fund, Nick went after Steve with Betsy in attendance. Though a panicked Betsy promised to stop seeing him, Nick found them picnicking together and violently confronted Steve. In the course of the argument, Nick had a massive heart attack. In agony, Nick muttered that he wished he'd killed Steve. After extracting a promise from Betsy never to see Steve again. Betsy vowed to stay away from Steve and entered into a hasty marriage with Craig Montgomery after he saved her from an explosion. Betsy and Craig's wedding kicked off 1983. By the time Craig and Betsy were pronounced husband and wife, Steve was standing outside the church in the rain, tears streaming down his face. Betsy's marriage was strained however due to Craig's jealousy and an unhappy Betsy left him to go to Spain. Upon returning to Oakdale, Betsy was ready to leave Craig, but lost her nerve when he planned a romantic evening for her. Torn between her love for Steve and her commitment to Craig, Betsy made love to Craig. When Betsy later became pregnant, she was convinced the child was Craig's and decided to commit herself to her marriage. Although Betsy reluctantly chose to remain with Craig, Steve could not accept the idea that she didn't love him anymore. And Craig went to great lengths to rub in the fact that Steve and Diana seemed to be an item now. Soon after, Steve was wanted by the police for the theft of Whit McColl's gold coins. Later, Betsy, who had been out shopping, got into her car and found a wounded Steve in the back seat. Despite knowing that he was wanted by the police, she took him to the boathouse and lovingly tended to his wounds. Betsy enlisted Steve's friend Tucker Foster to help them find out who framed Steve. She thought it was Whit, but Tucker was sure it was Craig. Then Betsy's grandfather, David, caught Betsy sneaking into the supply room at Memorial Hospital to get medicine for Steve. She begged her grandfather to come and examine him. David discovered that Steve was suffering from blood poisoning and gangrene and would die unless he got treatment. With Betsy's help, David operated on Steve right there in the boathouse. Meanwhile, one of Whit's rare coins had been bought by Bobbi Maxwell and her boyfriend, Lonnie. They traced Tucker from the pawnshop and called him for a meeting. Betsy and Steve joined the \\"coin hunt\\" and arrived for the meeting to try to buy back the coin. Actually, Craig was relieved, because now he could spend more time with Diana. But when Betsy told Craig she was going to call her broker and sell some stocks to get money for the cruise, Craig panicked. He had made some bad investments and had lost all her money in the stock market. The Montgomeries were broke, only Betsy didn't know it yet. In the process of attempting to help Steve, Betsy found that she was still in love with him and decided to leave her husband. Upon returning from a romantic evening with Steve at the boathouse, Betsy went into labor. It was a breech birth, and Steve had to get her to the hospital quickly. Diana discovered him there and tried to get him to leave, but Steve couldn't tear himself away from Betsy, who gave birth to a healthy daughter. In remembrance of her father Dan, she named the child Danielle. Craig told his wife how much he loved her, and now that they had a child, he hoped things would be all right between them. Although Betsy told Craig it was over, things changed when he was fired from his job. Later, Betsy was so moved when she heard Craig talking to his sleeping daughter about his losses, and weakly told Steve she couldn't leave Craig right now. When Steve exploded, Betsy stormed out, saying they were through. On Kim's advice, a sad Betsy wrote a note to Steve telling him how much she loved him. However, unbeknownst to her, Craig found the note, tore it up and forged a new one saying Betsy loved Craig and regretted having to betray him. The next morning, when Betsy came by to see Steve, Diana answered the door wearing only Steve's shirt. Devastated, Betsy decided she couldn't stay with Craig, so she moved in with Kim. The next morning when Betsy arrived to get the rest of her things, Craig picked a fight with her and seemed to fall down the stairs. Craig then cried \\"paralysis,\\" getting Betsy to move back in with him. A major storm ushered in the New Year. After it had passed, Betsy's boathouse was on shaky ground. She surprised Craig by telling him she planned to build a home for abandoned children on the lot and call it the Refuge. Steve's construction company put in a bid. Diana heard about Steve's plans, got hold of the other bids, and changed them, making Steve's the lowest. Steve and Tucker's company got the job. When Betsy couldn't go through with a romantic evening, Craig left in disgust. Upset that Steve was hindering her marriage, Betsy tried to destroy everything that reminded her of him. She found the book of Greek poetry Steve had given her when they first met and decided to give it back to him. When Betsy arrived at Steve's apartment, she tried to say she was through with him, but the chemistry between them was too strong, and they fell into a passionate embrace. Betsy and Steve agreed not to make love until after she had left Craig. After Craig accused her of having an affair with Steve, Betsy told Craig their marriage was over. Then she went upstairs to pack and discovered that Danielle was gone. Craig said he couldn't let Betsy take her away, so he hid her. Craig threatened to leave town with Danielle if Betsy called the police, and if she went to Steve, she'd never see her daughter again. Luckily, Craig's mother, Lyla, traced Danielle to the home of Mrs. Hoffman, a maid whom Betsy had fired previously, and Danielle was returned to her mother. At the same time, Diana McColl informed Steve that she knew Craig was faking his paralysis. Steve found Betsy at Kim's, and when she told him she'd left Craig for good, they had a joyful reunion. One day while driving, Betsy was in a terrible accident in Vermont. When she woke up, she needed plastic surgery because of the burns on her face and she had no memory of who she was. Alone and vulnerable, Betsy found herself becoming close to her doctor and agreed to marry him. After a while, though she started getting flashbacks of Oakdale and had to go there. While in Oakdale, Craig recognized Betsy and he reunited her with her family. At the same time, Steve had been arrested for the murder of Whit McColl. However, the McColl housekeeper Dorothy Connors confessed to the crime on the witness stand. Their life continued to be difficult though. Though Betsy loved Steve, they found themselves arguing more and more about money. Steve wanted the best for Betsy and spent lavishly but refused to tell Betsy where the money was coming from. Money pressures mounted when administration assistant Iva Snyder had an accident and Steve was unable to pay her medical bills. Soon they found themselves in debt, and Steve had to declare bankruptcy. Lucinda Walsh ended up buying Steve's construction company. He almost slept with Betsy's younger sister, Emily. Ashamed, Steve left Betsy to start over in Greece. Betsy went to visit him but was heartbroken to learn that Steve was arrested and sentenced a life sentence in a Greek jail for trafficking drugs and with much sorrow, she divorced him in the winter of 1987. After a failed attempt at romance with Josh Snyder, Betsy decided to get away from Oakdale and in 1988, she and Dani moved to Wisconsin to live near her uncle Ronnie Talbot. She did live briefly with Seth Snyder. See also *List of supercouples Further reading * To Be Continued... Soap Operas Around the World, Robert C.

It serves students K-5 and is part of Gwinnett County Public Schools. History The first McKendree School was built in 1884 adjacent to McKendree United Methodist Church on the Lawrenceville-Suwanee Road. The school derived its name from the church, which was also built that year and named after Bishop William McKendree. He was the first native-born bishop of the Methodist Church. In 1923, two unpainted rooms valued at $75 on one and a half acres accommodated two teachers and 78 students representing seven grades. A neighbor's well provided water for the austere building. The school equipment inventory listed only double patent desks and a small blackboard. In 1938, the school's value was placed at $1,500 even though it had no electricity. It closed in June 1942. The McKendree Elementary opened its doors to register 934 students, in kindergarten through fifth grade, on August 22, 1988. The facility was built at 650 Lakes Parkway, Lawrenceville, to ease overcrowding at two other Gwinnett County schools, Benefield and Dyer Elementary Schools. The new building contained 44 classrooms, an activity building for indoor physical education, an automated media center, a spacious cafeteria with self-serve lines for students and staff, and administrative offices for the principal and instructional lead teacher. By the end of its first year, McKendree had grown to a student enrollment of over 1,000, with a staff of 95. Two portable classrooms had been added to the physical plant. Under the leadership of principal Cindy Antrim, the students and staff of the new McKendree Elementary began to establish their own traditions. The Mustang was voted as the school mascot, and silver and royal blue as the school's colors. Its motto is \\"Making a Difference. Expecting Excellence.\\" The current principal is Dr. Denmark, and the current mascot is the Eagle.

It was established in 1947 as OKB-8 in Sverdlovsk, became independent in 1991, and then became part of the Almaz-Antey conglomerate. It is perhaps best known for designing the 9M82 and 9M83 missiles of the S-300V (SA-12 'Gladiator') SAM system. History The Kalinin Machine-Building Plant (now JSC MZiK) was a major part of the Soviet war effort in World War II, producing 20,000 anti-aircraft guns. After the war ended, Lev Lyulyev was promoted to Chief Designer of Factory No. 8 and he started work on heavy guns such as the KS-19 and KS-30. In 1947 he formed the Chief Designer Bureau (OGK) - later Experimental Design Bureau (OKB)-8 - of the Ministry of Aviation Industry, for the development of heavy anti-aircraft guns. As was the Soviet tradition, the OKB was often referred to by his name. In 1957 he switched to surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). Lyulyev died on 1 November 1985. OKB-8 became independent from the factory in 1991, but maintains a relationship with the factory. After the end of the Cold War, they set up the Novator Production-Commercial Bureau as a defence conversion enterprise to fund the work of the Design Bureau, but the company struggled financially throughout the 1990s. On 20 March 1996 General Designer Valentin Smirnov was murdered, possibly as a result of discovering fraud in the company. In 2001 Novator was amalgamated with other companies involved in SAM production, into the Almaz-Antey.

As he was carrying the wood back, he wished that it would carry him, and he rode it back like a horse. The king's daughter Vastolla, who never laughed, saw it and burst out laughing. Peruonto wished she would marry him and he would cure her of her laughing. A marriage was arranged for Vastolla with a prince, but Vastolla refused, because she would marry only the man who rode the wood. The king proposed putting her to death. His councilors advised him to go after the man instead. The king had a banquet with all the nobles and lords, thinking Vastolla would betray which man it was, but she did not recognize any of them. The king would have put her to death at once, but the councillors advised a banquet for those still lower in birth. Peruonto's mother urged him to go, he went, and Vastolla recognized him at once and exclaimed. The king had her and Peruonto shut up in a cask and thrown into the sea. Vastolla wormed the story out of Peruonto, and told him to turn the cask to a ship. Then she had him turn it to a castle, and then she had him turn himself into a handsome and well-mannered man. They married and lived happily for years. Her father grew old and sad. His councillors encouraged him to hunt to cheer him up. One day, he came to a castle and found only two little boys who welcomed him and brought him to a magical banquet. In the morning, he wished to thank them, but not only the boys but their mother and father‚ÄîVastolla and Peruonto‚Äîappeared. They were reconciled, and the king brought them back to his castle where the feast of celebration lasted nine days.

The \\"Treasure of Pouan\\" consists of a number of gold and garnet cloisonn√© jewels and ornaments, buried with a skeleton uncovered in 1842 at Pouan-les-Vall√©es and identified as the burial of a 5th-century Germanic warrior. Although the warrior had in the past been identified as that of Theodoric I, modern historians generally believe that this is unlikely. The find is now housed in the Mus√©e Saint-Loup (Mus√©e d'Art d'Arch√©ologie et de Sciences Naturelles), Troyes Discovery and contents The grave was accidentally uncovered in 1842 by a labourer at Pouan-les-Vall√©es (Aube), a French village in the canton of Arcis-sur-Aube on the south bank of the Aube River. It consisted of a skeleton buried with a number of gold and garnet cloisonn√© jewels and ornaments, including a gold ring inscribed ,Identified as the name of a Goth or Burgundian male by M. d'Arbois de Jubainville, \\"Recherches philologiques sur l'anneau sigillaire de Pouan\\", in Revue de Questions Historiques (1869). and accompanied by two swords with hilts encased in gold. The nature of the grave goods identified the burial as that of a Germanic warrior who lived in the 5th century. Linked to Theodoric I Oenochoe The antiquarian who first described this find, Achille Peign√©- Delacourt (1797‚Äì1881),Recherches sur le lieu de la bataille d'Attila (Paris) 1860. optimistically claimed that the elite burial could be that of Theodoric I, the Visigoth king, who had undisputedly been slain in the nearby Battle of Ch√¢lons. According to Peign√©-Delacourt's theory, the corpse had been hastily interred by his followers, who meant to recover it, and that the body recovered and buried with ceremony at Tolosa (present-day Toulouse), the body described by JordanesGetica 41 as found beneath a mound of corpses and borne away with heroic songs in sight of the enemy, was not actually that of Theodoric. A√´tius convinced Theodoric's son Thorismund to return home swiftly and secure the throne for himself before his brothers could begin a civil war. Thorismund quickly returned to Tolosa, buried the anonymously-recovered corpse with honours and became king without resistance. John Man describes the motivation imagined by Peign√©-Delacourt, :\\"...if Thorismund, eager to claim the throne over his brothers, might have had an interest in finding a corpse, any corpse, that could be identified, rightly or wrongly, as his father's, and buried quickly, with a show of grief, and instant acclamation for Thorismund as king\\".John Man, Attila: The Barbarian King who Challenged Rome, (2006) p. 240. Modern view In the last century, professional historians Thomas HodgkinHodgkin, Italy and Her Invaders, II.138-142 and later J.B. BuryHistory of the Later Roman Empire (1923), I.293 n. have generally expressed their scepticism over this identification. Other chance finds scattered over the area of Pouan and its neighboring village Villette‚Äî including two small bronze vases, a cup, a gilt-bronze ewer, blades and horse-trappings‚Äî support the local perceptionCl√©ment Drioton, \\"Nouvel essai de reconstitution des armes de Pouan conserv√©es au Mus√©e de Troyes\\" and R.

The classicist fa√ßade dates back to the 1820s; the ground-floor and the basement however were built in the Renaissance era. A fresco from 1752 in the former office tells about the history of the pharmacy in the Hungarian language. Cluj's first pharmacy was opened in the building in the house on the Main Square (today Pia≈£a Unirii) in 1573 and was operated by the government. In 1727 it was sold to its first private owner, Alexander Schwartz, than to Tobias Mauksch in 1752. In 1851 it was inherited by the (Transylvanian Saxon) Hintz family and was renamed \\"Saint George's Pharmacy\\" (La Sf√¢ntul Gheorghe). After the establishment of Communist Romania, the whole building was nationalized, and the pharmacy was closed. The descendants of the once wealthy Hintz family migrated to West Germany in the 1970s. Today the building houses the city's Pharmaceutical Museum. The collection of the history of pharmacy was developed by Professor Gyula Orient in the last century and is on exhibit in four ground rooms and in the basement. The initial use of the different rooms of the ancient shop was preserved as it was in the old times: the office, the storeroom and the laboratory. The original features from the second half of the 18th century pharmacy are emphasized in the ceiling of the office, which preserves the original frescos with pharmaceutical symbols. In the exhibition cases of Empire furniture one can see pharmaceutical implements of wood, ceramic, faience, porcelain and glass dating from the 17th‚Äì19th centuries. The reception desk features drugs, old receipts and seals of medieval pharmacies. The storeroom holds some of the furniture of the old drugstore with a rich collection of pharmaceutical wares of wood, collected from all over Transylvania. From this room, a staircase leads to the basement where the laboratory was located. Numerous bronze (16th‚Äì19th centuries), marble and cast iron mortars, scales, presses and weights are to be seen.

She was Vice President of Cultural Affairs at Robert Mondavi Winery which she joined in 1967. Under her direction, Robert Mondavi Winery developed original cultural and culinary arts programs. In 1980, she married Robert Mondavi and worked with him in many of his philanthropic activities including the founding of the museum Copia. Margrit played a key role in securing the downtown Napa location for the center, which opened in November 2001. She died of stomach cancer on September 2, 2016. Personal A native of Appenzell, Switzerland, Margrit Kellenberger was raised in her family home overlooking Lake Maggiore, in the canton of Ticino. By the end of World War II, Margrit met Capt. Philip Biever a United States Army captain. Following a brief courtship they were married in the Church of Madonna del Sasso on a wooded hillside above the city of Locarno. The newlyweds settled in her husband's new duty station, North Dakota had three children ‚Äî Philip Jr., Annie and Phoebe. Following several more moves around the country, the Bievers settled in the Napa Valley in 1960. After volunteering to help organize a concert at the Charles Krug Winery, she was hired by the winery and became the first female tour guide in the Napa Valley. Although the Krug Winery was owned by the Mondavi family, she did not meet her future husband Robert Mondavi until after he broke away from the family and started his own winery in 1966. Biever joined the Mondavi Winery the following year when she was hired as director of public relations. Mondavi and Biever had a long time affair and eventually divorced their first spouses in the late 1970s. Robert Mondavi and Margrit were married in Palm Springs in 1980. Working at the Robert Mondavi Winery When Margrit started working at Robert Mondavi Winery, there were very few visitors frequenting Napa Valley. One of the first things Margrit did was establish a fine arts program at the winery that brought many different artists to the winery including Richard Diebenkorn, Wayne Thiebaud and Nathan Oliveira. Margrit founded the winery's Summer Music Festival in 1969 as a benefit for the Napa Valley Symphony. This concert series has hosted many jazz, R&B; and pop artists including Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte and Tony Bennett. The Robert Mondavi Summer Jazz Festival opens with the New Orleans Jazz Band Preservation Hall. In 1984, the Festival of Winter Classical Concert Series was created, with the proceeds benefiting local musical organizations like the Napa Valley Opera. Together with Veronica di Rosa, Margrit and a small group of other Napa Valley art lovers formed a board of directors to rebuild the original 19th-century opera house in the city of Napa. She organized fundraising events, including art auctions, to keep the opera house alive. In 1998, the opera raised significant funds for the restoration as part of a challenge grant from Margrit and Robert Mondavi; the renovated opera house opened in October 2002. Cooking Annie and Margrit Cookbook After ten years at Robert Mondavi Winery, Margrit introduced a program of cooking classes. She introduced the Great Chefs of France and the Great Chefs of America programs that are now known simply as Great Chefs at Robert Mondavi Winery. In May 2003, Margrit and her daughter Annie Roberts, then the Robert Mondavi Winery's executive chef, released a collection of their recipes and stories called Annie and Margrit: Recipes and Stories from the Robert Mondavi Kitchen. In early 2004, the book won the 2003 Gourmand World Cookbook Awards' \\"Best in the World\\" distinction in the \\"Best Easy Recipes Book\\" category. Philanthropy In 1997, Margarit and her husband issued a challenge grant of $2.2 million to spur the reconstruction of the Napa Valley Opera House in Napa. Robert and Margrit Mondavi were also major patrons of the restoration of the Lincoln Theatre in Yountville which was reopened in early 2005. Also in 2001, Margrit and Robert made a substantial personal gift to the University of California at Davis to establish the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science, and to launch the Robert and Margrit Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts, which opened in October 2002. The couple supported the Oxbow School, a new art school in Napa that gives grants to and provides instruction for art students in their junior year of high school.

It is distinct from the Belgian Resistance which existed in German- occupied Belgium. In 1940, Belgian pre-war √©migr√©s and former soldiers who had escaped occupied Belgium were formed into units within the British military which later fought in the European and Mediterranean Theatres. These included an infantry formation, which later became the Brigade Piron, as well as Commando and paratroop units. Belgians also served in the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, serving in Belgian-only units as well as in majority-British units. Significant numbers of soldiers from the Belgian Congo fought on the Allied side against the Italians in East Africa. After the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, the Free Belgian forces formed the foundations of the new Belgian army. Background Belgian involvement in World War II began when German forces invaded Belgium, which had been following a policy of neutrality, on 10 May 1940. After 18 days of fighting, Belgium surrendered on 28 May and was placed under German occupation. During the fighting, between 600,000 and 650,000 Belgian men (nearly 20% of the country's male population) had served in the military. Most were made prisoners of war and detained in Germany, though some were released before the end of the war. Leopold III, king and commander in chief of the army, also surrendered to the Germans on 28 May along with his army and remained a prisoner for the rest of the war. The Belgian government fled first to Bordeaux in France, and then to London in the United Kingdom where it formed an official government in exile in October 1940. Creation of the Free Belgian forces Victor van Strydonck de Burkel in London, 1943 In a broadcast on French Radio shortly after the Belgian surrender, the Prime Minister Hubert Pierlot called for the creation of an army-in-exile, originally intended to continue fighting alongside the French: In Britain, the concept of foreign enlistment into the British army, or the creation of foreign armed forces on British soil, had been approved in the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939 and Allied Forces Act 1940. The first components of a Belgian military in Britain was created after the French surrender when the (CMBR; \\"Belgian Military Camp for Regrouping\\") was created in Tenby (Wales) in order to reform a military force from Belgian soldiers rescued from Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo, refugees, and expatriates living in the United Kingdom. By July 1940, the camp numbered 462 Belgians, and nearly 700 by August and 900 by November. These soldiers were organized into the 1st Fusilier Battalion in August, and the government appointed Lieutenant- Generals Raoul Daufresne de la Chevalerie as commander, and Victor van Strydonck de Burkel as inspector-general of the new force. In July 1940, a British Mass Observation report remarked that Belgian refugees in civilian employment in the United Kingdom were causing friction with British workers because they were considered to be pushing British workers out of jobs. The same report noted the \\"possible need for a Belgian Legion\\". In February 1941, a Belgian artillery battalion was formed. Belgian volunteers continued to join the Free Belgian forces throughout the war, most crossing through occupied and Vichy France, as well as Francoist Spain. Because the French refused to provide any form of visa to Belgians of military age, many of those arriving in England tended to be old and to have already had long military careers. This created a problem for the Free Belgian forces, which was therefore generally \\"top heavy\\", with a greater ratio of (older) officers to other ranks. Since the Belgian military had officially surrendered in May 1940 and the Belgian Constitution specifically forbade Belgians from joining foreign militaries, the Free Belgian forces were officially committing treason; the charge was only annulled in 1948 and nobody was prosecuted. Despite the formation of all-Belgian ground units from late 1940, many Belgian volunteers ‚Äì especially those in the Royal Air Force ‚Äì served in majority British units, particularly in the early years after the formation of the Free Belgian forces. Belgian Army in the United Kingdom =Brigade Piron= In 1940, the Belgian government-in-exile decided to raise a military unit from pre-war Belgian √©migr√©s and soldiers rescued from Dunkirk. The original forces were known as the 1st Fusilier BattalionThe two Fusilier Battalions formed in Britain and Canada between 1940‚Äì41 should not be confused with the 57 later Fusilier Battalions formed in Belgium after the liberation from October 1944. A 2nd Fusilier Battalion was formed in Canada from Belgian √©migr√©s in the Americas. Staghound armoured car in the markings of the 1st Belgian Armoured Car Squadron of the Brigade Piron. In 1942, the various Belgian ground forces units in the United Kingdom were amalgamated into the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade, more often known as the Brigade Piron after its commanding officer, Colonel Jean-Baptiste Piron. The unit not only included motorized infantry, armoured cars and artillery but also various logistics and medical support units. In March 1944, an artillery battery of four 25 pounder guns operated by troops from Luxembourg was added to the brigade's artillery unit. 80 Luxembourgers were serving with the Brigade Piron by August 1944 when the Brigade landed in Normandy. The brigade arrived in Normandy on 8 August 1944 and was involved in the fighting in Northern France alongside British and Canadian units. The brigade was one of the first Allied units to enter Belgium, crossing the border on 3 September. The following day, the brigade was the second Allied unit to enter Brussels (after the Welsh Guards). After the liberation of Belgium, the brigade was involved in fighting in the Netherlands until November 1944 when it returned to Belgium and reorganized, expanding on account of the new manpower. The reorganized brigade had three infantry battalions, an artillery regiment of six batteries, and an armored car regiment. Returning to combat in the Netherlands in April 1945, the brigade's units fought at Nijmegen and Walcheren. =No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando= Belgian Commandos, wearing the distinctive green beret, fire a mortar during a training exercise, 1945. The British No. 10 Commando was made up of soldiers from across occupied Europe, organized by nationality in eight troops. No. 4 Troop, created in August 1942, was Belgian and was commanded by Captain Georges Danloy. The original volunteers spent nearly a year in training, before leaving for Italy to fight alongside the British Eighth Army during the battles around Sangro river in the winter of 1943. In 1944, the troop was sent to Yugoslavia, where it raided numerous Dalmatian islands held by the Germans. In the Autumn of 1944, the troop was part of Operation Infatuate to capture the island of Walcheren at the head of the Scheldt Estuary, alongside Free Norwegian and British Commandos. The unit later moved into Germany. =5th Special Air Service= In 1942, 120 volunteers from the 2nd Fusilier Battalion were given parachute training and formed into a new unit, the Belgian Independent Parachute Company. The new unit was commanded by Commander Jean Thise, later replaced by Captain Edouard Blondeel. In February 1944 it joined the √©lite British Special Air Service (SAS) Brigade and was renamed the 5th SAS Regiment in March, even though it was only battalion- strength. The 5th SAS was deployed on numerous missions behind enemy lines. In July 1944, the small groups from 5th SAS were dropped by parachute into northern France to perform reconnaissance and sabotage missions and to link up with the French Resistance. Amongst their missions was to harass the German retreat from the Falaise Gap. In August 1944, it was the first Allied unit to enter Belgium when it was deployed to the Ardennes and Limburg. The small team, mounted in armed Jeeps, managed to kill more than 300 German soldiers and destroy over 100 vehicles during the mission. Later, the unit fought in the Netherlands and also served as a reconnaissance unit in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944. After the war it was sent to Germany to arrest leading Nazis, and was responsible for arresting Karl Doenitz, Alfred Rosenberg and Joachim von Ribbentrop as well as numerous others. Belgians in the Royal Air Force Spitfires of No. 350 Squadron at RAF Kenley, 1942 During the 18 Days' Campaign, the Belgian air force had lost practically all its equipment and 28 pilots had been killed. After the French surrender, many Belgian pilots escaped to England. 15 Belgian pilots served in fighter squadrons of the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Battle of Britain in June 1940 while a further 14 others served in auxiliary roles, such as navigators or gunners. All served in predominantly British squadrons rather than national units. By 1943, there were more Belgian pilots in the Royal Air Force than there had been in the Belgian air force in 1940. In November 1941, the all-Belgian 350 Squadron, was created. The regimental standard of the 2nd R√©giment d'A√©ronautique was smuggled out of occupied Belgium and presented to the unit. The incident was depicted in the 1943 British film The Flemish Farm. A year later, a second all-Belgian squadron, 349 Squadron, was created. Both units were equipped with Spitfires. By June 1943, some 400 Belgian pilots were serving with the RAF. The Belgian section of the RAF achieved its 100th \\"kill\\" in January 1944. Both squadrons served in the European theatre and were involved in the Normandy Landings. In 1943, a Belgian pilot from 609 Squadron, Jean de Selys Longchamps, strafed the Gestapo headquarters in Brussels, after flying through the streets at low-altitude. Operation Carthage an air raid on the Gestapo headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark in March 1945, was led by a Belgian, Wing-Commander Michel Donnet, who had escaped from occupied Belgium in a home-made aircraft. During the course of the war, 1,900 Belgians served in the RAF, Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and the South African Air Force (SAAF). 225 were killed in action. Royal Navy Section Belge Belgian sailors training at Skegness in England, 1945 On the initiative of Lieutenant Victor Billet, a Belgian sailor, the Royal Navy Section Belge (RNSB)The French name Section Belge (and the accompanying acronym RNSB) was adopted in order to avoid any confusion with the Royal Navy Patrol Service (RNPS). was created in October 1940. By 1941, the RNSB numbered 350 men with several hundred more Belgians serving on other British naval and merchant ships. Unlike the neighbouring Netherlands, which had possessed a sizeable navy, the Belgian Corps de Marine had had only few ships before the war. With the surrender in May 1940, many vessels, including A4 which had evacuated Belgian gold to Britain during the campaign, travelled to neutral Spain and interned themselves rather than return to occupied Belgium. Consequently, most of the volunteers of the RNSB had been civilian fishermen or members of the Merchant Navy rather than career soldiers. Around 1,400 men of the Belgian fishing fleet had left for Britain after the Belgian surrender. Three Belgian trawlers even took part in the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces from Dunkirk, rescuing 4,300 British soldiers between them. Their ships and crews were put at the disposal of the Royal Navy, for coastal patrols and launching barrage balloons. From October 1940, many joined the RNSB. The unit was placed under command of Lieutenant-Commander Georges Timmermans. Victor Billet himself was posted MIA during the Dieppe Raid in 1942. The RNSB operated two small corvettes, and , within the Royal Navy from 1942. Both corvettes served as convoy escorts during the Battle of the Atlantic, the Caribbean and also as part of the escorting fleet during D-Day. The RNSB also operated the 118th Minesweeper Flotilla, composed of MMS-class minesweepers, from Harwich from 1943. The 118th served in the English Channel and North Sea clearing paths through German minefields. In November 1944, the flotilla was involved in clearing the Scheldt Estuary to the Belgian port of Antwerp to enable it to be used by the Allies. After liberation, the Belgian government decided to increase the size of the RNSB to 1,200 men which would later form the backbone of the fledgling Belgian Navy. Force Publique Force Publique dispatch rider after the Siege of Sa√Øo, 1942 The Force Publique (or \\"Public Force\\") was a combined police and military force of the Belgian Congo. It had a peacetime strength of 18,000, making it one of the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time. During World War II, it was re-enforced, numbering 40,000, and constituted the bulk of the Free Belgian forces. Like other colonial armies of the time, the Force Publique was racially segregated; it was commanded by 280 white officers and NCOs but other ranks were exclusively native Congolese. The Force Publique had never been allowed the more modern equipment given to the Belgian army before the war, and consequently had to use outdated equipment and weapons, like the Stokes mortar and the Saint Chamond 70 mm howitzer. In June 1940, three battalions of the Force Publique were sent to Abyssinia alongside British forces to fight the Italians in the East African Campaign. In May 1941, the Force Publique, under Major-General Auguste-√âduard Gilliaert and Lt.-Col. Leopold Dronkers Martens, successfully cut off the retreat of Italian army of General Pietro Gazzera at the Siege of Sa√Øo in the Ethiopian Highlands, later accepting Gazzera's surrender with 7,000 of his soldiers. Over the course of the campaign in Abyssinia, the Force Publique received the surrender of nine Italian generals, 370 ranking officers and 15,000 Italian colonial troops before the end of 1941. Some 500 Congolese soldiers and 4 Belgian officers were killed during the campaign. mortars in Italian East Africa, c. 1941. After the Allied victory in Abyssinia, the Force Publique was redesignated the 1st Belgian Colonial Motorised Brigade and served as a garrison in Egypt and in British Palestine between 1943 and 1944. 13,000 Congolese soldiers also served in Nigeria as a garrison force. Despite its military success during the conflict, the Force Publique was vulnerable to internal agitation. In 1944, a Force Publique garrison in the town of Luluabourg mutinied against their white officers. A medical unit from the Congo, the 10th (Belgian Congo) Casualty Clearing Station, was created in 1943 and served alongside British forces in the Far East during the Burma Campaign. The unit included 350 African and 20 European personnel and continued to serve with the British until 1945. Special Operations Executive Numerous Belgians served as secret agents for the Allies within \\"T Section\\" of the Special Operations Executive (SOE). Agents were parachuted into occupied Belgium to liaise with the resistance from October 1940. Many were civilians from professional backgrounds rather than soldiers. It was exceptionally risky and of around 300 agents parachuted into Belgium, 75% were captured by the German Gestapo. Those captured were liable for torture or execution and 150 agents were killed. Uniforms and equipment Tommy Helmet\\", with an added Belgian flag, in the collection of the Nationaal Bevrijdingsmuseum in the Netherlands Unlike the Free French, whose army retained their national rank structure and much of its own equipment and uniforms, the Free Belgians were fully organized and equipped along British lines. Belgian troops adopted the British rank structure along with British Battle Dress uniforms and helmets. They were distinguished from other units by a rampant lion cap badge and a curved cloth badge inscribed \\"BELGIUM\\" worn on one shoulder, and a Belgian tricolor badge on the other. The Belgian army had traditionally used French- style uniforms, along with the characteristic Adrian helmet, meaning that from the First World War both armies had a very similar appearance. After the war, influenced by the Free Belgians and by British military advisors, the Belgian military instead adopted British-style uniforms and British-produced equipment. Legacy The Free Belgian forces formed the core of the post-war Belgian army. The Brigade Piron, expanded and renamed \\"Liberation\\" Regiment, formed the core of the Belgian army of occupation in Germany. The Free Belgian special forces formed the basis for the creation of the 1st Commando Regiment, and the 1st Parachute Regiment which even kept the \\"Who Dares Wins\\" motto of the SAS. The history of the Free Belgian forces continues to be celebrated within Belgium. The Belgian Marine Component, for example, still operates a ship named Godetia. There are numerous memorials to the participation of the Free Belgians forces in the liberation across the country and in areas liberated by the Free Belgians. The participation of soldiers from the Belgian Congo was, however, largely forgotten following Congolese independence in 1960 and decades of subsequent war, though in recent years the profile of the veterans has been raised by exhibitions creating greater public awareness.

The following article describes the history of the Azores. Myth and legend Stories of islands in the Atlantic Ocean, legendary and otherwise, had been reported since classical antiquity.Beazley (1897‚Äì1906, 1899:p.lxxii) Utopian tales of the Fortunate Isles (or Isles of the Blest) were sung by poets like Homer and Horace. Plato articulated the legend of Atlantis. Ancient writers like Plutarch, Strabo and, more explicitly, Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy, testified to the real existence of the Canary Islands. The Middle Ages saw the emergence of a new set of legends about islands deep in the Atlantic Ocean. These were sourced in various places, e.g. the Irish immrama, or missionary sailing voyages (such as the tales of Ui Corra and Saint BrendanBabcock (1922: Ch. 3)) and the sagas of Norse adventurers (such as the Gr≈ìnlendinga saga and the saga of Erik the Red). The peoples of the Iberian peninsula, who were closest to the real Atlantic islands, and whose seafarers and fisherman may have seen and even visited them,Already both Plutarch (Life of Sertorius) and Pliny the Elder report that fishermen from Gades (Cadiz) routinely visited Atlantic islands to the southwest. articulated their own tales. Medieval Andalusian Arabs related stories of Atlantic island encounters in the legend of the 9th-century navigator Khashkhash of Cordoba (told by al-Masudi)Beazley (1897: vol.1, p.465) and the 12th-century story of the eight Maghurin (Wanderers) of Lisbon (told by Muhammad al-Idrisi).Beazley (1906: vol. 3, p.532). Cortes√£o (1954 (1975)) From these Greek, Irish, Norse, Arab and Iberian seafaring tales ‚Äì often cross-fertilizing each other ‚Äì emerged a myriad of mythical islands in the Atlantic Ocean ‚Äì Atlantis, the Fortunate Islands, Saint Brendan's Island, Brasil Island, Antillia (or Sete Cidades, the island of the Seven Cities), Satanazes, the Ilhas Azuis (Blue Islands), the Terra dos Bacalhaus (Land of Codfish), and so on, which however uncertain, became so ubiquitous that they were considered fact. According to Bartolom√© de las Casas, two dead bodies that looked like those of Amerindians were found on Flores. He said he found that fact in Christopher Columbus' notes, and it was one reason why Columbus presumed that India was on the other side of the ocean.De Las Casas, Bartolom√©; Pagden, Anthony (8 September 1999). A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indias. New York: Penguin Books. . In A History of the Azores, written by Thomas Ashe in 1813, the author talks of the discovery of the islands by Joshua Vander Berg of Bruges, who landed there during a storm on his way to Lisbon. This claim is generally discredited among academics today. As were local stories of a mysterious equestrian statue and coins with Carthaginian writing that were purportedly discovered on island of Corvo, or the strange inscriptions found along the coast of Quatro Ribeiras (on Terceira): all unsubstantiated stories that supported the claims of human visitation to the islands before the official record. But there was some basis in fact, since the Medici maps of 1351 contained seven islands off the Portuguese coast which were arranged in groups of three; there were the southern group, or the Goat Islands (Cabreras), the middle group, or the Wind or Dove Islands (De Ventura Sive de Columbis), and the western islands, or the Brazil Island (De Brazil). The Atlas Catalan (of 1375) also identifies three islands with the names of Corvo, Flores, and S√£o Jorge, and it was thought that maybe the Genovese had discovered the Azores, and given them those names. But, generally, these stories highlighted that sightings were being made at the end of the 14th century, or at least, the peoples of Europe had a passing knowledge of islands in the Atlantic. Owing to the disorganized politics of the continent there were few nations able to organize an exploration of the Western Sea. There have been recent discoveries (2010‚Äì2011) of Hypogea (structures carved into embankments, that may have been used for burials) on the islands of Corvo, Santa Maria and Terceira, that might allude to a human presence on the islands before the Portuguese.These archaeological sites were first identified by Nuno Ribeiro (in 2010) during archeological visits to Corvo and Terceira, but further examination and dating were required to authenticate their validity There is no clear evidence that there were, in fact, other inhabitants on the islands, and archaeological investigations are only now commencing as to the age and relevance of these structures. Exploration = Early appearance on charts = Detail of the Azores and Madeira islands, from the 14th-century Corbitis Atlas The Azores archipelago began to appear on portolan charts during the 14th century, well before its official discovery date. The first map to depict the Azores was the Medici Atlas (1351). Its depiction was subsequently replicated in the Pizzigani brothers map of 1367, the Catalan Atlas (1375), the Pinelli‚ÄìWalckenaer Atlas (1384), the Corbitis Atlas (c. 1385‚Äì1410), the charts of Guillem Soler (1380, 1385), Mecia de Viladestes (1413) and others.Amat di S. Filippo (1892: p.534); Mees (1901: p.140). Marcel (1887: p.31) suggests it may have already been hinted at in the Angelino Dulcert (1339) map, under the names St. Brendan, Primaria sive puellarum, Capraria and Canaria. They are also listed in the Libro del Conoscimiento (c. 1380).Libro de Conoscimiento (1877 ed.: p.50) In these maps, the Azores are usually depicted vertically aligned, on a north‚Äìsouth axis, nine islands in three clusters. The island names, in order (from south to north) are usually (with their tentative translation): bottom cluster: * lovo or lobo (\\"island of wolves\\" (seals?), Santa Maria) * caprara or cabrera (\\"island of goats\\", S√£o Miguel), middle cluster: * y de brazil (\\"island of embers/fire\\", Terceira) * li columbi (\\"island of pigeons\\", Pico) * y de la ventura (\\"island of venture/winds\\", Faial) * san zorzo (\\"island of St. George\\", S√£o Jorge) top cluster: * li conigi (\\"island of rabbits\\", Flores) * y de corvis marinis (\\"island of sea crows\\", Corvo) It is notable that two of the names ‚Äì San Zorzo and Corvis Marinis ‚Äì would be transferred to the modern Azorean islands. Only Graciosa seems to be routinely missing on these maps. The Madeira archipelago also appears on most of these same maps, with their modern names: legname (Ligurian for \\"wood\\", Madeira), porto sancto (Porto Santo), desertas (Desertas) and salvazes (Savage Island). The source of this information is a mystery. It could simply be derived from pure legend, possibly of Andalusian Arab origin e.g. al-Idrisi speaks of an Atlantic island of wild goats (the Caprera?) and another of \\"cormorants\\", a scavenger bird (the \\"sea crows\\" of Corvis Marinis?)Babcock, p.166 But outside their erroneous axial tilt, the Azores do seem clustered with reasonable accuracy. From this cartographic record, there seems little doubt that both Madeira and the Azores were discovered, or at least sighted, during the 14th century, well before their official discovery dates.Cortes√£o (1954 (1975):p.82); Cortes√£o (1969: p.67) One (unproven) hypothesis is that the Azores were discovered in the course of a mapping expedition in 1341 to the Canary Islands, sponsored by King Afonso IV of Portugal, and commanded by the Florentine Angiolino del Tegghia de Corbizzi and the Genoese Nicoloso da Recco.The 1341 expedition is related by Giovanni Boccaccio \\"De Canaria et insula reliquis, ultra Ispaniam, in occeano noviter repertis\\" (repr. in Monumenta Henricina, vol. I, pp. 202‚Äì06.) Although not quite described in the 1341 report, Madeira and the Azores might nonetheless have been seen from a distance on the expedition's return via a long sailing arc (volta do mar) from the Canary islands.De la Ronci√®re (1925: p.4ff.); Magalh√£es Godinho (1962: p.30); Cortes√£o (1954 (1975):) Even if they were not discovered by the mapping expedition of 1341 itself, the islands may have been found by any of the numerous Majorcan expeditions that were launched into the Atlantic Ocean in the aftermath, destined for slaving runs on the newly mapped Canary islands.Fern√°ndez-Armesto (2007) Regardless of who sighted them during the 14th century, there seems to have been no follow-ons until the 15th century. = Portuguese exploration = Edward Wright's map \\"for sailing to the Isles of Azores\\", showing loxodromes or rhumb lines In the late 14th century, many maps appeared showing fictitious islands in the Atlantic. In this period, expanding commercial contacts linked the Mediterranean with communities along the Atlantic coast. In particular, Genoese, Florentine, and Venetian traders were active, and also religious groups seeking converts to Christianity. This expansion placed the Kingdom of Portugal in a strategic position. The seafaring Portuguese were eager to expand their realm and their influence. In this context, Prince Henry the Navigator (1394‚Äì1460) had an important role. He added his own financial support to the efforts of the Portuguese crown. He financed the construction of new ships, and established naval schools to harness seafaring knowledge and promote new technologies and their use. Prince Henry is generally credited with motivating modern navigation and directing discoveries during the age of exploration; for Azoreans he is one of their founding fathers. Prince Henry hoped to establish communication by sea with India and the legendary realm of Prester John, thereby outflanking the hostile Muslim states in northern Africa and the Holy Land. He was Grand Master of the Military Order of Christ, whose program of exploration, discovery, and settlement was tailored for this dual purpose. Prince Henry experimented with ships, navigational instruments, and maps, developing techniques that made oceanic travel possible. The Portuguese Atlantic islands were not unknown; a growing body of documents had shown that the islands were known to sailors. But most important, in the words of Prince Henry's personal chronicler, is that the Prince \\"ordered [Portuguese navigators and captains] to find the islands\\", rather than just sending his fleets into the unknown to discover what they could. =The re-discovery= The exact date of this re-discovery of the Atlantic islands is not clear, though historical accounts indicate that the islands of Santa Maria and S√£o Miguel were the first to be discovered by navigator Diogo de Silves around 1427. One fact often debated is the origin of the name \\"Azores\\" used to identify the archipelago. By 1492, in the globe of Martin Behaim, the eastern and central group of islands were referred to as Insulae Azore (\\"Islands of the Azores\\"), while the islands of western group were called the Insulae Flores (\\"Islands of Flowers\\"). Similarly, older nautical charts had identified them as the Ilhas Afortunadas (\\"The Fortunate Islands\\") or Ilhas de S√£o Brand√£o (\\"The Islands of Saint Brendan\\"). The use of mythical names in local naming became a theme; in S√£o Miguel and Pico there are communities called Sete Cidades, on Terceira, a peninsula along the southern coast is referred to as Monte Brasil, and the name Mosteiros is used on both islands of S√£o Miguel and Flores. There are also many examples of re-using names from island to island (for example, Cedros, S√£o Pedro, Feteiras, or Calheta). Three theories have developed about the naming of the archipelago. * The classical theory attributes the naming to the presence of diurnal birds of prey (some say goshawks, while others species of eagles), identified by Portuguese sailors at the time of discovery. But this theory has been discredited. The only bird of prey that nests in the archipelago is the common buzzard (Buteo buteo rothschildi), which was introduced during the period of colonization and settlement. Sailors may have confused existing migratory birds for such birds of prey, or used colloquial names and attributed them to these species, or some bird of prey species was present that became extinct since colonization; * The naming of the islands may have been an homage by the discoverer Gon√ßalo Velho Cabral to Santa Maria of A√ßores, patron saint of the parish of A√ßores, in the municipality of Celorico da Beira, District of Guarda. * \\"Azores\\" may have been a Portuguese variant of the Genovese or Florentine word azzurre or azzorre (\\"blue\\") and may refer to sailors' stories of the mythical \\"Ilhas Azuis\\". In fact, the blue-green vegetation on the islands of the Azores appears blue, even at a short distance. The Portuguese word for \\"blue\\" is similarly azul. It is clear that after 1420, regular expeditions captained by Gon√ßalo Velho Cabral, Diogo de Silves, and other mariners began exploring to the west and south of continental Portugal. On 15 August 1432, men form a small sailing vessel with a dozen crew landed on the island that would bear the name Santa Maria (owing to its supposed day of its \\"rediscovery\\", the Assumption Day of the Virgin Mary).Martin Behaim noted that two ships discovered the lands in 1431, and that a fleet of sixteen ships were sent to colonize the islands in 1432. With their beginnings in the eastern group of islands, the explorers advanced quickly into the rest of the archipelago, finally reaching the more westerly islands (Flores and Corvo) by about 1450 at a time when populations were already relatively large.The islands of Flores and Corvo were discovered by Pedro Vasquez de la Frontera and Diogo de Teive in 1452, during their return from voyages to the west, usually attributed to other discoveries or from fishing in the Terra dos Bacalhaus (the name attributed to the eastern coast of Newfoundland in Canada. The first expeditions, apart from coastal observations and an occasional landing were limited, and in most cases involved the deliberate disembarking of herd animals (sheep, goats and/or cattle), pigs and chickens on the discovered islands, as a way of providing future settlers with some means of subsistence. There is also a reference to the purposeful settling of a group of slaves at the end of the 1430s, in the area of Povoa√ß√£o on the island of S√£o Miguel. Settlement The \\"official\\" settlement of the archipelago began in Santa Maria, where the first settlement was constructed in the area of B√°ia dos Anjos (in the north of the island), and quickly moved to the southern coast (to the area that is now the modern town of Vila do Porto). Settlers quickly arrived from the provinces of Algarve and Alentejo as Gon√ßalo Velho's nephew and heir, Jo√£o Soares de Albergaria, advertised and promoted settlement on the island. In the following centuries settlers from other European countries would arrive, most notably from Northern France and Flanders. By 1440, other settlements had developed along the river-valleys and coastal inlets of S√£o Miguel, Terceira, Faial, and Pico, supported by game animals and fishing. An abundance of potable water sources, along with fertile volcanic soils, made the islands attractive and easy to colonize, and the growing wheat market supported an export economy (along with various plant species that allowed the development of the dye industry in the colonies). Christopher Columbus made an unplanned stop on Santa Maria while returning to Spain after his first voyage to America. His ship Ni√±a was forced there by a storm. During the storm, all hands had vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. Anchoring at Santa Maria, the travelers were told by people onshore that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby. Columbus sent half the crew ashore to fulfill their vow; he and the rest would go when the first group returned. But while the first crew members were saying their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the island's captain, Jo√£o de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that they were pirates. Castanheira commandeered their boat and rowed to Ni√±a with several armed men, in an attempt to arrest Columbus. Columbus did not allow Castanheira to come aboard, and Castanheira announced that he did not believe or care who Columbus said he was, especially if he was indeed from Spain. After two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book. The island of S√£o Miguel was apparently populated by 1444. The population came mostly from the regions of Estremadura, Alentejo, and Algarve. The colonists spread themselves along the coastline in areas where conditions of accessibility and farming were best. The fertility of the Azores contributed to its population expansion, as the islands were soon exporting wheat to the Portuguese garrison in North Africa and of sugar cane and dyes to Flanders. Later oranges were grown and exported to the British Isles. The area was also frequently subjected to pirate attacks. During these times Ponta Delgada became the capital. The first capital was Vila Franca do Campo, but when it was destroyed in 1522 Ponta Delgada assumed the position. It became the first city on the island in 1546. Terceira Island was the third island to be discovered, and its name literally means \\"Third Island\\". It was originally called the Island of Jesus Christ and was first settled in 1450. Graciosa Island was settled shortly afterward from settlers from Terceira. Flores Island was discovered in the late summer of 1452 by the navigator Diogo de Teive and his son Jo√£o de Teive. The island's charter passed to Fern√£o Telles de Meneses, who only populated the island with sheep in 1475. His widow, Dona Maria Vilhena, contracted the Flemish Willem van der Haegen to settle Flores. After some negotiation, D. Maria would cede the rights to the exploration of the islands to Van der Haegen, in exchange for monthly payments. Around 1478, Willem van der Haegen settles in Ribeira da Cruz, where he built homes, developed agriculture (primarily wheat), collected more woad species for export, and explored for tin, silver or other minerals (under the assumption that the islands were part of the mythic Ilhas Cassterides, the islands of silver and tin). Owing to the island's isolation and difficulties in communication his crops became difficult to export and van der Haegen left Flores in the late 1480s. By 1504 the island's charter passed to Jo√£o Fonseca and settlers streamed through the port of Armoeira to the small hamlets. The island became permanently populated during the reign of King Manuel I, in the year 1510, by people from various regions of continental Portugal, but mainly from the northern provinces. The island became arable, and grain and vegetables were cultivated. According to Santos et al.'s 2003 maternal DNA study of the Azores, people from Flores exhibit high genetic ancestry (~90%) with the Portuguese mainland, and Pacheco et al.'s 2006 paternal DNA study confirms that around 60% of all Azorean paternal lines are correlated to those common in mainland Portugal. Iberian Union The residents of Terceira, who mostly settled in Porto Judeu and Praia da Vit√≥ria and along the coastline, took a brave stand against King Philip II of Spain upon his ascension to the Portuguese throne in 1580. They, along with most of the rest of the Azores, believed that Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato was the rightful successor, and defeated the Spanish at the Battle of Salga in 1581. In 1583, Philip tried again at defeating the Azoreans. He sent his combined Iberian fleet to clear the French traders from the Azores, decisively hanging his prisoners-of-war from the yardarms and contributing to the \\"Black Legend\\". The Azores were the second-to-last part of the Portuguese empire to resist Philip's reign over Portugal (Macau being the last), Azores was returned to Portuguese control with the end of the Iberian Union, not by the military efforts, as these were already in Restoration War efforts in the mainland, but by the people attacking a well-fortified Castilian guarnition. The Azores served as a port of call for the Spanish galleons during their occupation. In December 1640 the Portuguese monarchy was restored and the islands again became a Portuguese possession. Liberal wars The islands of the Azores as they appeared in an 1818 map by J. Dosserray (ed.) The 1820 civil war in Portugal had strong repercussions in the Azores. In 1829, in Vila da Praia, the liberals won over the absolutists, making Terceira the main headquarters of the new Portuguese regime and also where the Council of Regency (Conselho de Reg√™ncia) of Mary II of Portugal was established. In the second half of the 19th century, Azores played an important role in the rebirth of Portuguese cod fisheries in Terra Nova (Newfoundland). In fact, it was Azorean emigrants from the East coast returned to their homeland that taught the American dory fishing technique to Portuguese that started to catch again cod in the Grand Bank after the middle of the 19th century.SILVA, A.

University of Evora, √âvora, pp. 130-143. PDF version Beginning in 1868, Portugal issued its stamps overprinted with \\"A√áORES\\" for use in the islands. Between 1892 and 1906, it also issued separate stamps for the three administrative districts of the time. From 1836 to 1976, the archipelago was divided into three districts, quite equivalent (except in area) to those in the Portuguese mainland. The division was arbitrary, and didn't follow the natural island groups, rather reflecting the location of each district capital on the three main cities (neither of each on the western group). *Angra consisted of Terceira, S√£o Jorge, and Graciosa, with the capital at Angra do Hero√≠smo on Terceira. *Horta consisted of Pico, Faial, Flores, and Corvo, with the capital at Horta on Faial. *Ponta Delgada consisted of S√£o Miguel and Santa Maria, with the capital at Ponta Delgada on S√£o Miguel. 20th century During the Second World War, in 1943, the Portuguese dictator Salazar leased bases in the Azores to the British. This represented a change in policy. Previously the Portuguese government only allowed German U-boats and navy ships to refuel there.The Role of Portugal ‚Äì co-opting Nazi Gold, Jonathan Petropoulos, Dimensions, Vol 11, No 1, 1997 This was a key turning point in the Battle of the Atlantic, allowing the Allies to provide aerial coverage in the middle of the Atlantic (i.e. it closed the Mid-Atlantic Gap). This helped them to hunt U-boats and protect convoys. In 1944, American forces constructed a small and short-lived air base on the island of Santa Maria. In 1945, a new base was founded on the island of Terceira and is currently known as Lajes Field. It was founded in an area called Lajes, a broad, flat sea terrace that had been a farm. Lajes Field is a plateau rising out of the sea on the northeast corner of the island. This air force base is a joint American and Portuguese venture. Lajes Field has, and continues to support US and Portuguese military operations. During the Cold War, the US Navy P-3 Orion anti-submarine squadrons patrolled the North Atlantic for Soviet submarines and surface spy vessels. Since its inception, Lajes Field has been used for refuelling aircraft bound for Europe, and more recently, the Middle East. The US Army operates a small fleet of military ships in the harbor of Praia da Vit√≥ria, three kilometers southeast of Lajes Field. The airfield also has a small commercial terminal handling scheduled and chartered passenger flights from other islands in the archipelago, Europe, and North America. =Carnation Revolution= In 1976, following the Carnation Revolution of 1974, the Azores became an Autonomous Region within Portugal (), along with Madeira, when the a new regional constitution was implemented and the Azorean districts were suppressed.

In these roles, he was widely recognised for waging successful vaccination and sanitation campaigns, and was also instrumental in advocating against the closure of the medical school.  Early life  Dias was one of five children born to Manuel Francisco Dias and Escolastica Fernandes e Dias in St Estevam , an island in Goa, India. The humble circumstances of his childhood are often mentioned in later accounts of his achievements. His brother Jo√£o Vicente Santana Dias, a Major in the Portuguese Army, is credited with helping him enrol at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Lisbon where he graduated with distinction in 1882. Upon graduation, he joined the Portuguese army as part of the military medical cadre in Mozambique.  Career  After spending five years in Mozambique, Dias was transferred to Goa in 1888. Around this time, the Portuguese authorities were seriously considering closing the Medical School of Goa with an inspection conducted by the Portuguese doctor Cesar Gomes Barbosa in 1897 recommending shutting the school down permanently. However, in 1902 the Portuguese government finally voted to keep the school open with arguments put forth by the prominent physician and politician Miguel Bombarda that the school would be the ideal place to train doctors for the colonies. While Bombarda did not acknowledge it, his arguments were previously put forth by native born Goan doctors including Dias himself who wrote in 1902. This vote coincided with the mandate of Dias who was appointed the director of the health services in Goa and director of the Medical School of Goa in 1902, only the second native born Goan to achieve this position in the colonial administration after his predecessor Rafael Pereira from Benaulim, Salcette. Though a native Christian, Dias was not from the elite social circles from which his predecessors had originated and is recognised as having worked his way towards social and professional recognition through personal effort and merit, in what was at the time, a highly stratified society. Dias was a strong proponent of modern European medicine and vaccination in particular, as opposed to the variolation or inoculation techniques that were common among the local population. He recommended the creation of vaccine parks in different districts despite the challenge this was to local beliefs about ritual and body pollution. He often condemned the latter in his writings. His anti-plague campaigns and sanitary policies played a large part in the adoption of modern European medicine across Goan society. His tenure ended in 1913 and he was succeeded by Jos√© Maria da Costa √Ålvares. Dias later became actively involved in politics and was appointed the President of the first Provincial Congress of Goa and also mayor of the Municipal Council of Ilhas.  Awards and Recognition  In recognition for his services to public health, Dias was made a Knight of the Military Order of Aviz (Cavaleiro, Official e Comendador da Real Ordem Militar de S. Bento de Aviz). A bust of Dias was installed in the premises of the Medical School of Goa and was later shifted to the front of his residence upon his death, where it still stands today. The inscription on the bust reads \\"Ao Grande Cirurgi√£o. Homenagem Dos Seus Concidad√£os (To the great surgeon. Homage from your fellow citizens)\\" Lu√≠s de Menezes Braganza the prominent Indian journalist and anti-colonial activist from Goa often wrote of contemporaries he admired in Pracasha, a Konkani language daily. Of Dias, he wrote that though Dias did not come from an aristocratic family, he served his people and his country well. He also wrote that Dias was not very polished in his manners and etiquette but the good of his people was always uppermost in his mind.  Personal life  Dias married Maria Veronica da Silva and had eight children Victor Manuel Dias, Luis Gonzaga Bismarck Dias, Alvaro Jose Maria da Silva Dias, Antonio Francisco Dias, Ernesto Dias, Albertina Lavinia Escolastica Dias e Afonso, Aurea Dias e Lobo and Alice Leonor Brigida Dias e Fialho. A number of his children went on to achieve individual renown in their own fields of study and practice. His bought the Casa da Moeda in Panjim, Goa where his descendants continue to live and opposite which his statue is installed. He also purchased a large tract of land in Naroa, an island along the river Mandovi opposite his home island of St. Estevam, where he built a Chapel.  Death  Dias died in 1936 and was buried in his native St Estevam where his family grave occupies a prominent place in the front of the cemetery.

The books deal with supernatural forces, specifically witchcraft. Witch's Sister, the first book in the series, was adapted into an episode of the television series, Big Blue Marble. Characters *Lynn Morley is an eleven-year-old living in small town Indiana. She is considered to be a \\"normal\\" child, and thus her fear of and belief in the supernatural is considered unusual by her parents. Despite suspecting Mrs. Tuggle of witchcraft, Lynn confronts the old woman on many occasions, fearing to do otherwise could mean harm for her family and friends. *Marjorie \\"Mouse\\" Beasely is Lynn Morley's best friend, and accompanies her throughout the series. Marjorie's parents have recently separated, causing her to feel very insecure, and thus making her vulnerable towards Mrs. Tuggle when she offers maternal guidance. *Mrs. Elnora Tuggle is an elderly woman, and neighbor to Lynn and Marjorie. She is originally from England, immigrating to Indiana as a young bride, where she pursued her witchcraft quietly for many years. However, when the town is voting to dig up the old cemetery where her brother is buried, the old woman takes a great interest in forming a coven, enlisting the assistance of Lynn's various friends and family members. It is believed by Lynn and Marjorie that Mrs. Tuggle's brother didn't drown, as she claims, but was murdered by the old woman so he could be bodily transformed into an animal to do her bidding. At the end of the third novel, the witch's house is hit by lightning and burns down, Mrs. Tuggle still inside of it. Her spirit lives on however, through her glass eye which did not perish in the flames, and possesses Lynn, almost causing her to commit suicide. It is later revealed that Mrs. Tuggle did not die in the fire, as she returns in the final novel, adapting the alias of Elnora's younger sister, \\"Greta Gullone.\\" Lynn, Marjorie, their families and friends confront Mrs. Gullone at her house on a dark November night, combining their energy into transforming the old woman into an innocent kitten, which Marjorie later adopts.

The offices of First Deemster and Clerk of the Rolls were merged in 1918,Judicature (Amendment) Act 1918 s.3 (Statutes of the Isle of Man vol.X p.261) and provision was made for the appointment of an English King‚Äôs Counsel as a standing Judge of Appeal, to sit with one deemster to hear appeals from the other Deemster.ib. ss.5 & 6 The governor ceased to be a judge of the court in 1921.Judicature (Amendment) Act 1921 s.3 (Statutes of the Isle of Man vol.X p.245) The jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal, which was set up in 1921,Criminal Code Amendment Act 1921 s.10 (Statutes of the Isle of Man vol.XI p.52) was transferred to the Staff of Government Division of the High Court on 1 December 1969.Criminal Appeal Act 1949 s.1 (Statutes of the Isle of Man vol.XXI p.107 From 1991 the jurisdiction of the court in family matters was to be exercised by a new Family Division.High Court Act 1991 s.2 (Statutes of the Isle of Man 1991 c.12) A new office of Deputy Deemster was created in 2002Civil Jurisdiction Act 2001 s.7 (Statutes of the Isle of Man 2001 c.28) but abolished in 2009 (see below). With effect from 1 September 2009 the constitution of the High Court was changed.Administration of Justice Act 2008 (Statutes of the Isle of Man 2008 c.14) There are now two tiers of judges:-- *Deemsters, i.e. the First Deemster and Clerk of the Rolls, the Second Deemster and the Judge of Appeal, together with any additional deemsters, full-time or part-time, who may be appointed. At present, there is one full-time additional deemster (who previously held the office of Deputy Deemster), and additional part-time deemsters (previously called 'acting deemsters') are appointed from time to time to hear a particular case. *Judicial officers: the High Bailiff and Deputy High Bailiff, who are stipendiary magistrates, are judicial officers ex officio, together with any additional judicial officers, full-time or part- time, who may be appointed. At present, there is no full-time additional judicial officer, but additional part-time judicial officers are appointed from time to time to hear a particular case. At the same time the separate Chancery, Common Law and Family Divisions were merged into a single Civil Division, and the procedure of the court was reformed on similar lines to the English Civil Procedure Rules 1998.Rules of the High Court of Justice 2009 (Statutory Document 352/09) Court of General Gaol Delivery All serious crimes on the Isle of Man are tried in the Court of General Gaol Delivery. The Second Deemster normally sits as the judge. This court is not formally part of the High Court, but is administered as though it were part of the High Court. The court deals with all criminal matters where defendants have been committed for trial or sentence by a court of summary jurisdiction. Juries are normally composed of seven persons (unlike the usual twelve in England or fifteen in Scotland). The equivalent court in England and Wales is the Crown Court. In 1992 the last-ever death sentence in any court in the British Isles was pronounced by Deemster Callow upon Anthony Teare for murder (although a sentence of life imprisonment was subsequently imposed following a retrial).

This leads to a very high thermal conductivity. It is known as \\"second sound\\" because the wave motion of heat is similar to the propagation of pressure waves in air (sound). Normal sound waves are fluctuations in the density of molecules in a substance; second sound waves are fluctuations in the density of particle-like thermal excitations (rotons and phonons). Second sound can be observed in any system in which most phonon-phonon collisions conserve momentum. This occurs in superfluids, and also in some dielectric crystals when Umklapp scattering is small. (Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering exchanges momentum with the crystal lattice, so phonon momentum is not conserved.) Second sound in helium II Second sound is observed in liquid helium at temperatures below the lambda point, 2.1768 K, where 4He becomes a superfluid known as helium II. Helium II has the highest thermal conductivity of any known material (several hundred times higher than copper). Second sound can be observed either as pulses or in a resonant cavity. The speed of second sound is close to zero near the lambda point, increasing to approximately 20 m/s around 1.8 K, about ten times slower than normal sound waves. At temperatures below 1 K, the speed of second sound in helium II increases as the temperature decreases. Second sound is also observed in superfluid helium-3 below its lambda point 2.5 mK. Second sound in other media Second sound has been observed in solid 4He and 3He, and in some dielectric solids such as Bi in the temperature range of 1.2 to 4.0 K with a velocity of 780 ¬± 50 m/s, or NaF around 10 to 20 K. In 2019 it was reported that ordinary graphite exhibits \\"second sound\\" at 120 Kelvin. This was both predicted theoretically and observed experimentally, and was by far the hottest temperature at which second sound has been observed. However, this second sound is observed only at the microscale, because the wave dies out exponentially with characteristic length 1-10 microns. Therefore, presumably graphite in the right temperature regime has extraordinarily high thermal conductivity _but_ only for the purpose of transferring heat pulses distances of order 10 microns, and for pulses of duration on the order of 10 nanoseconds. For more \\"normal\\" heat- transfer, graphite's observed thermal conductivity is less than that of, e.g, copper. The theoretical models, however, predict longer absorption lengths would be seen in isotopically-pure graphite, and perhaps over a wider temperature range, e.g. even at room temperature. (As of March 2019, that experiment has not yet been tried.) Applications Measuring the speed of second sound in 3He-4He mixtures can be used as a thermometer in the range 0.01-0.7 K. Oscillating superleak transducers (OST) use second sound to locate defects in superconducting accelerator cavities.

During that time, the Byzantine Emperor Basil II had to fight both the Bulgarians and the dangerous rebellion under Bardas Skleros and he turned the customary means of the Byzantine policy: conspiracy. His attention concentrated on Aron, who was more dangerous at the time due to the proximity of his seat to Thrace; and because of his ambition to rule over Bulgaria alone which made an eventual peace profitable for both Aron and Basil. The Bulgarian noble asked for the Emperor's sister's hand and Basil agreed but he tried to deceive Aron and sent him the wife of one of his nobles and the bishop of Sebasteia. However, the attempted deceit was revealed and the bishop was killed, but the negotiations continued nonetheless. In the end Samuel learned of the secret negotiations and on 14 June 976 Aron together with all of his kin were executed in the vicinity of present-day Dupnitsa. Only his eldest son Ivan Vladislav was spared due to the intervention of Samuel's son Gavril Radomir. Ivan Vladislav murdered his saviour 39 years later to avenge the death of his innocent siblings, thus usurping the throne and becoming Emperor of Bulgaria. Family tree  Another theory  However, there's also another version about Aron's origin.Nicholas Adontz. Samuel l'Armenien, Roi des Bulgares. Bruxelles, Palais des academies, 1938. Published also in: Etudes Armeno-Byzantines. Livraria Bertrand. Lisbonne, 1965, Pp. 347 - 407 According to this version, Simeon I of Bulgaria had several children. One of them was Ivan who married to an Armenian in Caesarea and Aron and his brother Moses were Ivan‚Äôs sons.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History The Great Hall Memorial on Northampton Guildhall to Diana, Princess of Wales The first guildhall in Northampton was a 12th-century building at the junction of Gold Street and Horsemarket. The second guildhall was an early 14th-century battlemented structure at the corner of Abington Street and Wood Hill; it was sold in 1864 and subsequently demolished. The current building, the third guildhall, designed by Edward William Godwin in the Gothic Revival style, was officially opened on 17 May 1864. The original part of the building was symmetrical with three first-floor windows either side of the main entrance. The building was extended to the west to the designs of A W Jeffrey and Matthew Holding in 1892, creating a frontage of 14 bays with arcading on the ground floor and windows above on the first floor. The sculptor R.L. Bolton was commissioned to design 14 statues of monarchs and other famous people which were erected on the front elevation between the windows on the first floor. A modern extension to the east, built to accommodate the expanding office needs of Northampton Borough Council, was completed in 1992. Inside, the great hall displays murals of famous local men, painted by Colin Gill in 1925. It also contains murals of The Muses Contemplating Northampton, painted by Henry Bird in 1949. A statue by Sir Francis Chantrey of Spencer Perceval, Member of Parliament for Northampton and the only British Prime Minister to have been assassinated, was originally unveiled in 1817 and is also on display inside. A plaque on the eastern extension marks the fact that Diana, Princess of Wales, was made a Freeman of the Borough of Northampton in 1989, marking her and her family's strong connections with the town and with Althorp where she was brought up and is buried. The plaque below the memorial reads: \\"The memorial above was unveiled by the 9th Earl Spencer in memory of his sister, 7 November 2002 in the presence of the Mayor of Northampton, Michael Geoffrey Boss\\". A series of bronze statues of Northampton's \\"history makers\\", cast by the sculptor Richard Austin, were unveiled in the courtyard outside the guildhall in July 2017.

The film was distributed by Redbus Film Distribution and directed by Paddy Breathnach.  Plot  The film's main characters are Mo Chara, Scud Murphy and Cereberal Paulsy, all from West Belfast. They have an interest in dog racing, which the narrator, Mo Chara, informs us, is very important in Ireland. A hooky booky makes a proposition to them, to help him win a race through underhanded methods and in exchange, he'll give them a dog. After sabotaging the race as requested, they find out that the dog, 'Boots' as they call him, is useless as a racing dog. When propositioned by someone else to help sabotage the booky's attempts to win a very important race, they receive a dog, Cerberus as a reward. They decide to test out Cerberus' ability and enter him in a race. However, instead of racing, Cerberus lies down inside the box and does not move, losing the boys some money. Outside the track after the race, the boys argue over what to do with the dog, when they are kidnapped and put in the back of a van. When they wake up, they find themselves hung up in a dog-food processing plant with the bookie and his henchman, Mooney in front of them. The bookie says that because they sabotaged the race his dog was in, which had a prize of ¬£50,000, that they owed him that amount. He gives them a week to pay it. The boys decide to go 'down south' to the Republic of Ireland in order to escape their pursuers. While in the south, they see a local fair and decide to race the dog so as to win some money. The dog loses and angers Scud, who sells him to some travellers who are there, against Mo Chara's wishes. Later, it turns out that the dog is actually a great racer, which Mo Chara puts down to him only chasing real hares, not plastic ones. And the only place they use real hares is in Clonmel at the annual all-Ireland dog coursing championship. The three leave just after a fight breaks out between Scud, Paulsy and the rest of the fair and go in search of the travellers and their dog. They manage to steal the dog and get away from the traveller camp, after a brief chase down Irish country roads, they get away from the travellers and make their way towards Clonmel. On the way, they lose the dog out the back door of the van so they turn around to catch him again, after running over a dog which they're relieved to find isn't Cerberus, they find him again. The lads eventually get to Dublin and get some money by applying to test drugs at a clinic. That same night they find and have sex with three Polish girls, except for Scud who gets erectile dysfunction when he's called to perform. They eventually get the dog and race him in Clonmel. After the dog wins several of his races, the hooky booky again appears and once again demands what he says they owe him. As the boys are discussing what they should do, the travellers appear on the scene again and hold the boys over a cliff, about to kill them. At the last minute Mo Chara offers them a deal where if the dog wins, the boys get to keep the dog, but they'll give the travellers the money they bet on the dog, plus half the prize money and if the dog loses, they'll pay the traveller's what they think he's worth, which they say is 50 grand in an unspecified currency. They can't win the money themselves because the dog is in the boys' name. After some tense moments, the dog eventually wins and the travellers get their money and the boys get theirs. Paulsy ends up opening the first hash caf√© in West Belfast, Scud gets a brand new shop van, Mo Chara builds a dogtrack and Cerberus is put out to stud.

History  The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, S.C. 1992, c. 37 (CEAA) is an Act of Parliament that was passed by the Government of Canada in 1992. The Act requires federal departments, including Environment Canada, agencies, and Crown corporations to conduct environmental assessments for proposed projects where the federal government is the proponent or where the project involves federal funding, permits, or licensing. The purposes of the Act were set out as follows: (1) to achieve sustainable development that conserves environmental quality by integrating environmental factors into planning and decision-making process, (2) exercise leadership within Canada and internationally, and (3) to provide access to information and to facilitating public participation. The original version of the Act was repealed in 2012 and re-written by the Harper government. The new law came into effect on July 6, 2012. There are marked differences between the new act, the Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (sc2012 c-19) and the previous act, the Environmental Assessment Act (sc 1992 c-37). The new Act omits the preamble and statement of purpose. Section 4 of each Act is a clause that lists purposes. The new Act is more restrictive in purpose. It applies to \\"designated projects\\" instead of \\"projects\\". Public participation is \\"during\\" an environmental assessment instead of \\"throughout\\". The new Act also adds as a purpose that assessment be completed in a timely manner. The Regulations Designating Physical Activities document (RDPA) describes the projects covered by the new Act. The new Act limits assessment just to the type of projects listed in this regulation (and its amendments). The previous Act applied to all projects that altered the environment. The Inclusion List Regulations (SOR/94-637) described projects for which a screening report was always required. The Inclusion List regulation was twice the size of the current list of designated physical activities. The previous Act also required a screening report for any project for which a federal department was required to issue a license or permit under the specific sections of other acts listed in the Federal Authorities Regulation (SOR/96-280). The previous Act also required a modified screening report for projects where the proponent was a Crown Corporation or for projects outside of Canada or where the Government of Canada funded the project. Under the previous Act, other federal departments were not allowed to issue licenses and permits until any required environmental assessment was complete. Under the new Act, certain other departments, specifically the National Energy Board, may issue licenses and permits without an environmental assessment, may conduct their own assessment, and may cancel existing assessments currently in process. The Prescribed Information for the Description of a Designated Project Regulations (SOR/2012-148) gives the information required under the new Act. A lawyer with no knowledge of biology could supply the information. Only section 17(a) question, the requirement to describe changes the project may cause to fish habitat requires knowledge of ecology. Information on environmental effects is limited to effects on fish, aquatic species, and migratory birds. The regulations under the previous Act required essentially the same information in the basic project description, except that it also required information on terrain, air, vegetation, all wildlife, and all habitats. Central to the previous Act was a comprehensive study. What was to be included in the study was determined for each project. The agency issued a project-specific comprehensive study guideline within 90 days of receipt of the project application. The comprehensive study specified baseline data that needed to be collected, identified specific groups that needed to be consulted, and identified specific concerns for the proponent to address. The new act does not require a comprehensive study. The new Act decreases initial input from biologists and accelerates the movement of the project to the legal hearing stage. Upon receipt of the project description, the agency has ten days to request additional information and post the project description on the internet. Following 20 days in which the public may post comments, the agency has 25 days to decide if the project requires a formal environmental assessment. Different bodies may conduct the assessment, but all assessments now follow judicial procedures of argument and counter-argument. The previous Act used a \\"biologist to biologist\\" approach. The agency had 90 days to determine if a project required a comprehensive study and to prepare project- specific impact assessment guidelines for the comprehensive study. Following completion of the comprehensive study, the agency could determine that no further review was necessary. If further review was necessary, the project could be sent to mediation or to a formal review panel. The new Act limits public input. The general public is allowed to comment on a new project during the 20 days the project is open for comment on the internet. During the formal review, only those who are \\"directly affected\\" by the project may participate. The legal meaning of \\"directly affected\\" in this context refers generally to persons who own property within one kilometer of the project. Under the previous Act, the project description was posted on the internet immediately, but the main source of public input was the consultation process described in the project-specific guidelines for any project that required a comprehensive study. The general rule was to actively inform the public and to solicit concerns. This included information sessions where the proponent would make a presentation and then solicit comments. The guidelines would list the municipal governments and tribal councils that must be consulted. For projects that went to formal review, the participation was open to all parties with an interest that was \\"neither frivolous nor vexatious\\" Both the old and new Act require an assessment report within 12 months. However, the new Act also requires the Minister to make a decision within 24 months if the Minister has referred the matter to a review panel. Although the new law allows some extensions, the effect of a review panel failing to hear all testimony within the required time is that the Minister must reject the project application. Approval of the application in the face of an incomplete review is not a legal option for the Minister. The legal principles that apply in Canada are similar to the principles that required U.S. President Obama to reject the application for the Keystone Pipeline when forced to make a decision by Congress In 2016, the government of Justin Trudeau held a discussion about the CEAA and the RDPA. They then proposed the Impact Assessment Act.  Purpose  The purpose of CEAA 2012 is to: * Protect components of the environment that are within federal legislative authority from significant adverse environmental effects caused by a designated project; * Ensure that designated projects are considered and carried out in a careful and precautionary manner in order to avoid significant adverse environmental effects when a federal authority is exercising a power or performing a duty or function required for the project to proceed; * Promote cooperation and coordination between federal and provincial governments; * Promote communication and cooperation with Aboriginal peoples; * Ensure that opportunities are provided for meaningful public participation; * Ensure that environmental assessments are completed in a timely manner; * Ensure that proposed projects on federal lands or that are outside Canada and carried out or financially supported by a federal authority, are considered in a careful and precautionary manner in order to avoid significant adverse environmental effects; * Encourage federal authorities to take actions in a manner that promotes sustainable development in order to achieve or maintain a healthy environment and a healthy economy; and * Encourage further studies of the cumulative effects of physical activities in a region and the consideration of the study results in environmental assessments.  When does CEAA 2012 apply?  CEAA 2012 applies to projects described in the RDPA, namely physical activities summarized therein. When the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (the Agency) is the responsible authority for a designated project that is described in the RDPA, upon acceptance of a project description, an analysis is undertaken by the Agency to decide if a federal environmental assessment is required. This step does not apply to designated projects regulated by the National Energy Board and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission for which conducting an environmental assessment is mandatory when such a project is designated. A project may be designated by the Minister of the Environment if he or she is of the opinion that the carrying out of the project may cause adverse environmental effects, or that public concerns related to those effects warrant the designation. An environmental assessment under CEAA 2012 is required for each project designated by the Minister of the Environment.  Administration  = Responsible authority = A responsible authority ensures that an environmental assessment of a designated project is conducted in accordance with CEAA 2012, including ensuring the public is provided with an opportunity to participate in the environmental assessment. Under CEAA 2012, responsible authorities can be the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, the National Energy Board or the Agency. = Other federal authorities = Federal departments and agencies with specific expertise are required to provide information and advice that support the conduct of environmental assessments by responsible authorities. For projects on federal lands that are not designated projects, before a federal authority or an airport authority may carry out the project or exercise any power or perform any duty or function that will permit the project to be carried out, the authority will have to be satisfied that carrying out the project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. This also applies if the Governor in Council has decided the project's significant adverse environmental effects are justified in the circumstances. This responsibility also applies to projects outside of Canada that are federally funded or for which the Government of Canada is the proponent.  What is examined during a federal environmental assessment?  The following factors must be considered: * environmental effects, including environmental effects caused by accidents and malfunctions, and cumulative environmental effects * significance of those environmental effects * public comments * mitigation measures and follow-up program requirements * purpose of the designated project * alternative means of carrying out the designated project * changes to the project caused by the environment * results of any relevant regional study * any other relevant matter Types of environmental assessments  There are two types of environmental assessment conducted under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA 2012): # environmental assessment by a responsible authority, # and environmental assessment by a review panel. An environmental assessment by a responsible authority is conducted by the Agency, the National Energy Board or the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. Information on the process for environmental assessments conducted by the Agency is provided below. Information with respect to environmental assessments conducted by the National Energy Board or Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission may be found on their websites. An environmental assessment by review panel is conducted by a panel of individuals appointed by the Minister of the Environment and supported by the Agency. Both types of assessments can be conducted by the federal government alone or in cooperation with another jurisdiction, such as a province.  Timelines  Upon acceptance of a complete project description, the Agency has 45 calendar days, including a 20-day public comment period, to determine whether a federal environmental assessment is required. An environmental assessment conducted by the Agency must be completed within 365 days. This timeline starts when a notice of the commencement of the environmental assessment is posted on the Registry Internet site and ends when the Minister of the Environment makes a decision as to whether the designated project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. The Minister of the Environment may refer a project to a review panel within 60 days of the notice of commencement of an environmental assessment. An environmental assessment by a review panel needs to be completed within 24 months. This timeline starts when the proposed project is referred to a review panel and ends when the Minister of the Environment issues the environmental assessment decision statement. = Extensions = For every environmental assessment: * The Minister may extend the time limits by an additional three months, to facilitate cooperation with another jurisdiction or to take into account other circumstances specific to the project. * Upon recommendation of the Minister of the Environment, the Governor in Council may also extend the time limit (in addition to the three-month extension granted by the Minister). * The period that is taken by the proponent to respond to a request from the Agency or a review panel (conduct studies, prepare environmental impact statement, collect further information, etc.), is not counted in the timelines.

Presidents √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n (1920-1924) and Plutarco El√≠as Calles (1924-1928) were elected on a PL ticket and in 1922 the PL managed to defeat the Liberal Constitutionalist Party (PLC) in congressional elections, becoming largest party in the Congress of Mexico. Competition with rival parties, including the PLC, the National Cooperativist Party (PNC), the Mexican Communist Party (PCM), the National Agrarianist Party (PNA) and the National Anti- Reelectionist Party (PNA) was often violent, the government usually supporting the PL. After the assassination of Obreg√≥n, who was recently elected, in 1928 the party's power started to decline. Morones was suspected to benefit from Obreg√≥n's death and lost support. In 1929, Calles founded the National Revolutionary Party (PNR), which was to become the 'official' party. The PL last participated in the election in 1940, when it supported the right-wing candidate Juan Andreu.

In organic chemistry, the Kumada coupling is a type of cross coupling reaction, useful for generating carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds by the reaction of a Grignard reagent and an organic halide. The procedure uses transition metal catalysts, typically nickel or palladium, to couple a combination of two alkyl, aryl or vinyl groups. The groups of Robert Corriu and Makoto Kumada reported the reaction independently in 1972. The reaction is notable for being among the first reported catalytic cross-coupling methods. Despite the subsequent development of alternative reactions (Suzuki, Sonogashira, Stille, Hiyama, Negishi), the Kumada coupling continues to be employed in many synthetic applications, including the industrial-scale production of aliskiren, a hypertension medication, and polythiophenes, useful in organic electronic devices.  History  The first investigations into the catalytic coupling of Grignard reagents with organic halides date back to the 1941 study of cobalt catalysts by Karasch and Fields. In 1971, Tamura and Kochi elaborated on this work in a series of publications demonstrating the viability of catalysts based on silver, copper and iron. However, these early approaches produced poor yields due to substantial formation of homocoupling products, where two identical species are coupled. These efforts culminated in 1972, when the Corriu and Kumada groups concurrently reported the use of nickel-containing catalysts. With the introduction of palladium catalysts in 1975 by the Murahashi group, the scope of the reaction was further broadened. Subsequently, many additional coupling techniques have been developed, culminating in the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry recognized Ei-ichi Negishi, Akira Suzuki and Richard F. Heck for their contributions to the field.  Mechanism  Accepted catalytic cycle for Kumada cross coupling reaction = Palladium catalysis = According to the widely accepted mechanism, the palladium-catalyzed Kumada coupling is understood to be analogous to palladium's role in other cross coupling reactions. The proposed catalytic cycle involves both palladium(0) and palladium(II) oxidation states. Initially, the electron-rich Pd(0) catalyst (1) inserts into the R‚ÄìX bond of the organic halide. This oxidative addition forms an organo-Pd(II)-complex (2). Subsequent transmetalation with the Grignard reagent forms a hetero- organometallic complex (3). Before the next step, isomerization is necessary to bring the organic ligands next to each other into mutually cis positions. Finally, reductive elimination of (4) forms a carbon‚Äìcarbon bond and releases the cross coupled product while regenerating the Pd(0) catalyst (1). For palladium catalysts, the frequently rate-determining oxidative addition occurs more slowly than with nickel catalyst systems. = Nickel catalysis = thumb Current understanding of the mechanism for the nickel-catalyzed coupling is limited. Indeed, the reaction mechanism is believed to proceed differently under different reaction conditions and when using different nickel ligands. In general the mechanism can still be described as analogous to the palladium scheme (right). Under certain reaction conditions, however, the mechanism fails to explain all observations. Examination by Vicic and coworkers using tridentate terpyridine ligand identified intermediates of a Ni(II)-Ni(I)-Ni(III) catalytic cycle, suggesting a more complicated scheme. Additionally, with the addition of butadiene, the reaction is believed to involve a Ni(IV) intermediate.  Scope  =Organic halides and pseudohalides= The Kumada coupling has been successfully demonstrated for a variety of aryl or vinyl halides. In place of the halide reagent pseudohalides can also be used, and the coupling has been shown to be quite effective using tosylate and triflate species in variety of conditions. Despite broad success with aryl and vinyl couplings, the use of alkyl halides is less general due to several complicating factors. Having no œÄ-electrons, alkyl halides require different oxidative addition mechanisms than aryl or vinyl groups, and these processes are currently poorly understood. Additionally, the presence of Œ≤-hydrogens makes alkyl halides susceptible to competitive elimination processes. These issues have been circumvented by the presence of an activating group, such as the carbonyl in Œ±-bromoketones, that drives the reaction forward. However, Kumada couplings have also been performed with non- activated alkyl chains, often through the use of additional catalysts or reagents. For instance, with the addition of 1,3-butadienes Kambe and coworkers demonstrated nickel catalyzed alkyl‚Äìalkyl couplings that would otherwise be unreactive. 600px Though poorly understood, the mechanism of this reaction is proposed to involve the formation of an octadienyl nickel complex. This catalyst is proposed to undergo transmetalation with a Grignard reagent first, prior to the reductive elimination of the halide, reducing the risk of Œ≤-hydride elimination. However, the presence of a Ni(IV) intermediate is contrary to mechanisms proposed for aryl or vinyl halide couplings. 400px =Grignard reagent= Couplings involving aryl and vinyl Grignard reagents were reported in the original publications by Kumada and Corriu. Alkyl Grignard reagents can also be used without difficulty, as they do not suffer from Œ≤-hydride elimination processes. Although the Grignard reagent inherently has poor functional group tolerance, low-temperature syntheses have been prepared with highly functionalized aryl groups. = Catalysts = Kumada couplings can be performed with a variety of nickel(II) or palladium(II) catalysts. The structures of the catalytic precursors can be generally formulated as ML2X2, where L is a phosphine ligand. Common choices for L2 include bidentate diphosphine ligands such as dppe and dppp among others. Work by F√ºrstner and coworkers on iron-based catalyts have shown reasonable yields. The catalytic species in these reactions is proposed to be an \\"inorganic Grignard reagent\\" consisting of Fe(MgX)2. = Reaction conditions = The reaction typically is carried out in tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether as solvent. Such ethereal solvents are convenient because these are typical solvents for generating the Grignard reagent. Due to the high reactivity of the Grignard reagent, Kumada couplings have limited functional group tolerance which can be problematic in large syntheses. In particular, Grignard reagents are sensitive to protonolysis from even mildly acidic groups such as alcohols. They also add to carbonyls and other oxidative groups. As in many coupling reactions, the transition metal palladium catalyst is often air-sensitive, requiring an inert Argon or nitrogen reaction environment. A sample synthetic preparation is available at the Organic Syntheses website.  Selectivity  = Stereoselectivity = Both cis- and trans-olefin halides promote the overall retention of geometric configuration when coupled with alkyl Grignards. This observation is independent of other factors, including the choice of catalyst ligands and vinylic subsituents. 350px Conversely, a Kumada coupling using vinylic Grignard reagents proceeds without stereospecificity to form a mixture of cis- and trans-alkenes. The degree of isomerization is dependent on a variety of factors including reagent ratios and the identity of the halide group. According to Kumada, this loss of stereochemistry is attributable to side-reactions between two equivalents of the allylic Grignard reagent. 500px = Enantioselectivity = Chiral ligands for enantioselective Kumada couplings. A: [Methoxyalkyl(ferrocenyl)] monophosphine B: bis-oxazoline Asymmetric Kumada couplings can be effected through the use of chiral ligands. Using planar chiral ferrocene ligands, enantiomeric excesses (ee) upward of 95% have been observed in aryl couplings. More recently, Gregory Fu and co- workers have demonstrated enantioconvergent couplings of Œ±-bromoketones using catalysts based on bis-oxazoline ligands, wherein the chiral catalyst converts a racemic mixture of starting material to one enantiomer of product with up to 95% ee. The latter reaction is also significant for involving a traditionally inaccessible alkyl halide coupling. Enantioconvergent coupling of Œ±-bromoketones = Chemoselectivity = Grignard reagents do not typically couple with chlorinated arenes. This low reactivity is the basis for chemoselectivity for nickel insertion into the C‚ÄìBr bond of bromochlorobenzene using a NiCl2-based catalyst. NiCl2 catalyzed Kumada coupling shows haloselectivity on bromochlorobenzene.  Applications  = Synthesis of Aliskiren = The Kumada coupling is suitable for large-scale, industrial processes, such as drug synthesis. The reaction is used to construct the carbon skeleton of aliskiren (trade name Tekturna), a treatment for hypertension. Kumada coupling in the synthesis of aliskiren = Synthesis of polythiophenes = The Kumada coupling also shows promise in the synthesis of conjugated polymers, polymers such as polyalkylthiophenes (PAT), which have a variety of potential applications in organic solar cells and light-emitting diodes. In 1992, McCollough and Lowe developed the first synthesis of regioregular polyalkylthiophenes by utilizing the Kumada coupling scheme pictured below, which requires subzero temperatures. Synthesis of polythiophenes via Kumada coupling Since this initial preparation, the synthesis has been improved to obtain higher yields and operate at room temperature.

Lyrics There is speculation that Davies wrote the song in reference to the wild lifestyle of his younger brother, Kinks guitarist Dave Davies. Release and reception \\"Dandy\\" was only released in Britain and America on the Face to Face album. However, it was released as a single in Continental Europe, where it charted, reaching #1 in Germany, #2 in Belgium #3 in the Netherlands and #6 in Austria. In some countries, (such as Norway) \\"Dandy\\" was flipped with \\"Party Line\\" (also from Face to Face) as the A-side. AllMusic's Stewart Mason said of \\"Dandy\\" that \\"Davies delivers the lyrics, about a neighborhood lothario, with just the right mixture of disgust and admiration; his slyly witty vocals are truly what makes the song. Musically, the tune harks back to the music hall tradition of George Formby; Dave Davies' guitar is so trebly and clean that it sounds like a ukulele ‚Äì or perhaps an electrified rubber band ‚Äì and the gently swinging tune sounds like it could have been an old vaudeville hit. 'Dandy' is a charming, slightly subversive, gem.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine, also from AllMusic, noted \\"the music hall shuffle of 'Dandy'\\" as a \\"wonderful moment\\" from Face to Face. 'Dandy' was a regular feature of The Kinks live act from 1966 to 1969 but was dropped thereafter. Herman's Hermits version \\"Dandy\\" became a hit single in North America in 1966 as recorded by fellow UK group Herman's Hermits in that same time frame, reaching #1 in Canada on the RPM national singles chart and #5 in the US on the Billboard Hot 100. It also made #3 in New Zealand. This version was not released as a single in the UK. When comparing The Kinks' original version of \\"Dandy\\" to Herman's Hermits' cover, Stewart Mason of AllMusic said, \\"Herman's Hermits would have the US hit with Ray Davies' 'Dandy,' but the Kinks' own version, from 1966's masterful Face To Face, is far superior to Peter Noone's charming but gormless rendition.\\" The Rockin' Vickers version The Rockin' Vickers also released \\"Dandy\\" as the A side to a 1966 single. (Their main claim to fame was that Lemmy was a band member before his stint with Hawkwind and his formation of Mot√∂rhead.) British singer Clinton Ford also released a version of the song as a single in the same year.  David Garrick versions The Kinks' Pye Records label mate David Garrick included the song on his 1967 album \\"A Boy Named David\\", as well as a live version on the 1968 German release \\"David Garrick and the Dandys - Blow-Up Live\\".

Called a \\"novel-in-stories\\" by OV Books, it explores the troubled life of young professional Beth Dinard from the perspective of the character herself as well as others around her. O Street was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Debut Fiction in 2007. Contents The ten stories collected in O Street revolve around the life of young professional Elizabeth Dinard, who has escaped an impoverished and abusive childhood in New Jersey but still suffers its effects in adulthood. Each story, told from the perspective of Beth herself or one of the people around her, explores a different period of her troubled life. * \\"The Wrong Place in the World\\" * \\"September 1981\\" * \\"Visiting Mrs. Ferullo\\" * \\"Where We're Going This Time\\" * \\"O Street\\" * \\"Leaving\\" * \\"Afterbirth\\" * \\"The Shell Game\\" * \\"The Cat\\" * \\"Read Me Through the Bardo, Won't You?\\" Themes In a 2007 interview with Time Out Chicago, Wycoff said that the stories were based on the \\"political truth\\" that \\"single mothers fall through the cracks in this country, and the cracks grow in proportion to these women's economic challenges, making inaccessible the so-called American Dream\\". She explained that, though she drew on her own experiences as a single mother, the stories were not autobiographical. Michael Upchurch of The Seattle Times wrote that the book recognizes \\"how even the most toxic family connections have some kind of love threaded through them\\", and notes that \\"its heroine, even in the worst circumstances, keeps fierce hold of her dignity\\". He added: Writing and publication Citing author Cris Mazza as her creative muse and mentor, Wycoff noted, \\"she helped me see that the disparate single- mother stories I'd written could be linked.\\" Wycoff explained, \\"In a linked- story format, I can present other points of view as short pieces of contrast. I wanted to structure the book so that it begins and ends with a death, because I wanted it to read as a cycle. Linearity, to me, seems more of a construct than cycles.\\" She told Time Out Chicago, \\"The second [story] I wrote when my son was two years old. I wrote it, in part, in reaction to all of the sentimental, dreamy writing about motherhood.\\" Noting that most writing about motherhood is \\"so ebullient and romantic\\", Wycoff told The Stranger that \\"there are a lot of mothers out there who don't feel that way about motherhood at all.\\" While seeking a publisher for O Street, Wycoff said, \\"I got about seven rejections over the course of four years, all from small presses, many of whom called the collection 'too dark'.\\" Picked up by small publisher OV Books, the book's title was initially announced as The Wrong Place in the World, the title of the first story. O Street is also the title of a story in the collection. Three of the stories have been published previously: \\"Afterbirth\\" (in New Letters), \\"The Shell Game\\" (in Coal City Review), and \\"O Street\\" (in Other Voices magazine). \\"Afterbirth\\" and \\"Visiting Mrs. Ferullo\\" won the second annual Heartland Short Fiction Prize in 1999. \\"Afterbirth\\" was also excerpted in Oregon Quarterly in Spring 2007 in conjunction with the book's release. Reception Upchurch wrote of O Street, \\"This is one grim, tough, upsetting book. Yet it's also shot through with a painful radiance and level intelligence that keep you with it every step of the way.\\" He praised Wycoff's \\"sharp ear for how speech can signal a gulf between social realities impossible to bridge\\". Publishers Weekly called the collection \\"a straightforward look at pain and renewal\\". David Bradley praised the book: Describing the collection as \\"White Oleander blown into A Million Little Pieces\\", Cris Mazza wrote, \\"Stripped of sentimentality and sanguinity, Corrina Wycoff 's O Street is a relentless stare into the dark yawn of brutality.\\" Alex Shakar praised it as \\"deeply moving, deftly told, and keenly insightful\\", and Aimee Liu called it \\"a harrowing portrait of familial pain, mental illness, and the sometimes cruel tenacity of love\\". Reviewing the collection for Rain Taxi, Garin Cycholl wrote that \\"the book sings violently and truly\\". Comparing O Street to the work of Dorothy Allison \\"for its depictions of poor women and lesbian relationships\\", Gretchen Kalwinsky wrote for Time Out Chicago: Christopher Frizzelle wrote for The Stranger, \\"The virtue of the book is the way it deals with topics that have become clich√©s through characters who aren't clich√©s. The psychology in O Street is nuanced and feels true.\\" Awards O Street was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Debut Fiction in 2007.

The Blue Knob massif (the summit is the snow field in the middle of the range). Prominent meander in the Raystown Branch near Breezewood Bedford County, Pennsylvania is situated along the western border of the Ridge and Valley physiographic province, which is characterized by folded and faulted sedimentary rocks of early to middle Paleozoic age. The northwestern border of the county is approximately at the Allegheny Front, a geological boundary between the Ridge and Valley Province and the Allegheny Plateau (characterized by relatively flat-lying sedimentary rocks of late Paleozoic age). (PA Geological Survey Map 13) The stratigraphic record of sedimentary rocks within the county spans from the Cambrian Warrior Formation to the Pennsylvanian Conemaugh Group (in the Broad Top area). No igneous or metamorphic rocks of any kind exist within the county. The primary mountains within the county (From west to east: Wills, Evitts, Dunning, and Tussey mountains) extend from the southern border with Maryland to the northeast into Blair County, and are held up by the Silurian Tuscarora Formation, made of quartz sandstone and conglomerate. Chestnut Ridge is a broad anticline held up by the Devonian Ridgeley Member of the Old Port Formation, also made of sandstone and conglomerate. Broad Top, located north of Breezewood, is a plateau of relatively flat-lying rocks that are stratigraphically higher, and thus younger (Mississippian and Pennsylvanian), than most of the other rocks within the county (Cambrian through Devonian). Broad Top extends into Huntingdon County to the north and Fulton County to the east. The Raystown Branch of the Juniata River is the main drainage in the northern two-thirds of the county. The river flows to the east through the mountains within the county through several water gaps caused by a group of faults trending east‚Äìwest through the central part of the county. The river then turns north and flows into Raystown Lake in Huntingdon County. The southern third of the county is drained by several tributaries of the Potomac River. Both the Potomac and Juniata rivers are part of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. All of Bedford County lies far to the south of the glacial boundary, and thus it was never glaciated (PA Geological Survey Map 59). However, during the Pleistocene epoch, or \\"Ice Age,\\" periglacial (meaning \\"around glacier\\" or simply \\"cold\\") processes dominated. Most of the county was most likely a tundra at that time. The many boulder fields obvious as rocky and often treeless areas on mountainsides within the county formed as a result of seasonal freeze-thaw cycles during the Pleistocene. Several limestone quarries exist in Bedford County, most of which are owned and operated by New Enterprise Stone & Lime Company. Quarry locations include Ashcom, New Paris (inactive), Kilcoin (closed), and Sproul (inactive). Two coal fields exist within Bedford County. One is the Broad Top Field in the northeastern corner of the county, and the other is the Georges Creek Field along the southwestern border (PA Geological Survey Map 11). Both fields contain bituminous coal. There are abandoned mines in both areas and acid mine drainage is an environmental problem in the Broad Top area, where several fishless streams exist as a result of the discharge from the abandoned mines. Natural gas fields and storage areas exist in southeastern Bedford County, primarily within folded Devonian rocks south of Breezewood. Another deep gas field exists in the vicinity of Blue Knob on the border with Blair County to the north. (PA Geological Survey Map 10) Interesting Features Interesting geologic features within Bedford County include some of the following: * New Enterprise New Paris quarry, where fossil corals and bryozoans may be found within the Devonian Keyser Formation. * Coral Caverns in Manns Choice. * The roadcut through Warrior Ridge on Rt. 30 (Everett Bypass), where an exposure of Silurian and Devonian rocks from limestone to shale to conglomerate can be seen. * The roadcut on the north side of the Pennsylvania Turnpike at the Narrows water gap (where the Raystown Branch cuts through Evitts Mountain) exposes a continuous section of the Reedsville Formation, Bald Eagle Formation, Juniata Formation, and the Tuscarora Formation. The beds of the Bald Eagle are overturned, folded, and faulted. The Tuscarora and Juniata are also exposed on the south side of the gap along Rt. 30. * Sweet Root Natural Area, within Buchanan State Forest and located near Chaneysville, where periglacial processes have created a bouldery landscape by eroding the Tuscarora Formation of Tussey Mountain. * Blue Knob, a notable ski resort and recreational area, is also the state's second highest point at 3146 feet/959 m (after Mount Davis in Somerset County to the west). * A transpression structure is located on the northern border of the county (shared with Blair County), about three miles east of the town of Woodbury. This structure is an up-thrust block of Cambrian and Ordovician rocks bounded on all sides by north-trending faults. The southern tip of the structure is approximately at Pulpit Hill. * An outcrop on the north side of Rt. 30 about three miles west of the village of Juniata Crossing shows an excellent example of a thrust fault within the Devonian Catskill Formation. * The Raystown Branch of the Juniata River between Breezewood and Raystown Lake to the north is an example of a river with incised (or entrenched) meanders.

It ranks amongst the major books on alchemy in Early Modern literature, just as much as does Atalanta Fugiens by Michael Maier. It has been reprinted numerous times. Consisting mainly of illustrated plates, Mutus Liber arouses contradictory interpretations. Its meaning was pored over for a long time by authors such as Eug√®ne Canseliet and Serge Hutin, who claimed to be initiated alchemists. More recent studies are striving to use its historical reality in order to reveal its meaning.See FLOURET, Jean, ¬´ √Ä propos de l'auteur du Mutus Liber ¬ª, Revue fran√ßaise d'histoire du livre, n¬∞ 11 ‚Äì N.S., avril-juin 1976, p. 206-211.  Editions  The first edition of Mutus Liber dates from 1677, published by Pierre Savouret in La Rochelle.For an analysis of the editions and attributions of authorship, see SEMBEL, Patrick, Herm√®s Atlantique, Le Mutus Liber, 1677, L'√©loge d'√©ther, 2015, 65 p. . No more than a few dozen copies can have been printed. Twelve original copies are conserved in main Western libraries. There may be more copies, however. As early as 1702 it was reprinted in Geneva, with new plates, and edited by Jean-Antoine Chouet and Jean-Jacques Manget. Eug√®ne Canseliet purports seeing some pages of a Parisian edition dating from 1725. But the existence of this edition has not been established. A third version of Mutus Liber was entirely reprinted around 1760 in Paris, and this third edition is extremely rare. Mutus Liber was temporarily forgotten, but then regained editorial interest in the second half of the 19th century. Since the beginning of the 20th century, editions have multiplied, sometimes accompanied by prefaces detailing more or less precisely its contents. The main editions of Mutus Liber are the following: *1867 by Thibaud publishing house in Clermont Ferrand; *1914, by Nourry, prefaced by Pierre Dujois, alias Magophon; *1943, by Paul Derain, the publisher; *1966 by Pauvert publishers, prefaced by Eug√®ne Canseliert; *1967 by L'Unit√© publishers, prefaced by Serge Hutin; *1991 Edition Weber, Amsterdam, introduction by Jean Laplace.

Steiner; *2015 by Editions √† l'Envers, with new plates by Raymond Meyer.  History of attributions of authorship  Mutus Liber clearly indicates the names of its author and of its inventor. The former is Altus, a \\"scholar in high chemistry of Herm√®s\\". The latter is Jacob Saulat, Sire of Marez. However, these assertions were soon proven to be fictitious, thus the authorship of Mutus Liber has long been in doubt. Rev. Arc√®re, a noted historian of La Rochelle, claims that Jabob Toll√© is the author though his very existence was even put in doubt.ARC√àRE, M. Histoire de la ville de La Rochelle et du Pays d'Aunis, tome 2, Chez Desbordes, La Rochelle, 1757, p. 394. Toll√© was in fact a Rochelais doctor reputed for using chemistry and mastering perspective.MONCONYS, Balthasar de, Journal des Voyages, Lyon, Boissat & Remeus, 1665, p. 20 These two qualities account for the fact that he was acknowledged as the author for a long time. However, ever since the article by Jean Flouret, it has been established that the author of Mutus Liber is in fact Isaac Baulot. Using clues in Mutus Liber and contemporary documents, Patrick Sembel suggests three people were involved with Isaac Baulot. Abrahaim Th√©venin probably worked on the plates, as the presence of his monetary symbol on the first illustrated page of Mutus Liber indicates. Elie Bouh√©reau and Elie Richard must have contributed to the conception of the book. As doctors and scholars who used chemistry, they would have had many contacts who would facilitate publishing the book. Elie Richard studied at Groningen with Des Maretz, a philosopher whose name is used to designate the person who discovered Mutus Liber. Elie Bouh√©reau knew Valentin Conrard, a secretary of the Acad√©mie Francaise, as well as many major authors and philosophers of the time. It is he who attributed authorship of Mutus Liber to Isaac Baulot.  Interpretations  The form of Mutus Liber means that is open to various interpretations. Four ways of reading the book may be distinguished. The most widespread reading is that of 'initiated alchemists', started off by Pierre Dujols,DUJOLS, Pierre, alias Magophon, Hypotypose du Mutus Liber, Paris, Editions Nourry, 1914. under the pseudonym of Magophon. It is carried on by Eug√®ne CanselietCANSELIET, Eug√®ne, L'Alchimie et son livre muet, Paris, Pauvert, 1967. and Serge Hutin.HUTIN, Serge, Commentaires sur le Mutus Liber, Paris, Le lien, 1967 These authors say that Mutus Liber shows how to proceed to achieve the magnum opus, whose ultimate purpose is to obtain the philosopher's stone. Carl Gustav Jung studied Mutus Liber, and owned a copy of the 1677 edition. He used it namely to illustrate his work entitled Psychology and Alchemy.JUNG, Carl-Gustav, Psychologie et Alchimie, Buchet/Chastel, 1970, p. 756 In this book Jung explains how alchemy is speculative thinking looking for the spiritual equilibrium whose metaphorical form would be the philosopher's stone. This process is accompanied by the creation of a repertoire of mental pictures, or archetypes, which would gradually lead to a collective unconscious. More recently Lee Stavenhagen worked on the narrative structure used to illustrate Mutus Liber.Stavenhagen, Lee, \\"Narrative Illustration Techniques and the Mute Books of Alchemy\\", Explorations in Renaissance Culture, vol. 5, issue 1 (December 1979), 56‚Äì69. . In their research Jean Flouret and Patrick Sembel have been trying to define the contents of Mutus Liber by putting it into its religious, intellectual and scientific context.

It was the home of American lexicographer Noah Webster (1758-1853), and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1962. and Description and history The main portion of the Webster House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a large central chimney and center entrance. It was probably built sometime in the first half of the 18th century, as part of a farm, and is a typical frame residence of that era. A single-story brick addition was added to the house at an early date, probably to house a kitchen, and a wood frame ell was also eventually added to the rear. A modern museum addition, roughly in the shape of a barn, was added in the 1970s after the property was rehabilitated and prepared for use as a museum. In 1758 the house was the birthplace of Noah Webster. His father mortgaged the farm, including this farmhouse, for Noah to attend Yale College. Webster returned to the house after graduation, and was engaged as a teacher at local schools. His interest in lexicography prompted a series of publications, beginning with a spelling book in 1783 and culminating in the publication in 1828 of his Dictionary of the American Language, which sold millions of copies during his lifetime, and laid down basic principles for dictionaries and spelling books that are still used today. The house was continuously occupied as a private residence until 1962, when it was given to the town. In 1966 it opened as a museum. It currently contains several items with Webster associations, including early editions of the Dictionary of the American Language and Blue-backed Spellers, as well as china, glassware, a desk, and two clocks that Webster owned as an adult. The house also serves as the headquarters of the West Hartford Historical Society.

He was the author of books on the boats that ply the inland waterways. He captained the flat-bottom, stern paddlewheeler, the Delta Queen, from San Francisco, down the Pacific coast, through the Panama Canal, across the Gulf of Mexico and up the Mississippi and Ohio rivers to Pittsburgh in 1946. Biography He was born on February 17, 1901. Little is known of his youth. He apparently gravitated to a life on the river early, as he obtained his pilot‚Äôs license in 1923 at the age of 22 and purchased his first steamboat, the Betsy Ann, in 1925, at the age of 24. He married Grace Morrison and they resided in Sewickley, Pennsylvania. Using the iron-hulled Betsy Ann, Way ran a packet ship between Cincinnati and Pittsburgh for a number of years. Prior to Way‚Äôs purchase of the Betsy Ann, she had held the packet ship speed record on the Mississippi River since the 1900s, winning and retaining a set of gold-tipped elk horns. In August 1928, Way and the Betsy Ann lost the elk horns to Captain Christopher Becker Greene of the steamboat Chris Greene, in a race from Cincinnati to New Richmond. In 1933 Way wrote a book of his experiences as a river packet ship captain called The Log of the Betsy Ann. The book was moderately successful, allowing Way to form the Steamboat Photo Company (SPC) in 1939. SPC gathered the largest collection of steamboat photos then known, and became the impetus for the publication of Way‚Äôs Steamboat Directory in 1944 and the formation of the Sons and Daughters of Pioneer Rivermen (SDPR), of which Way was a founding member and later a president. SDPR became the driving force behind the formation of the Ohio River Museum in Marietta, Ohio. In 1948, at the request of his friend Tom Greene, Way captained the 21-year-old Delta Queen from San Francisco to Pittsburgh. He wrote about the adventure of piloting the paddle wheeler down the west coast, through the Panama Canal, across the Gulf of Mexico and up the Mississippi River to Pittsburgh in The Saga of the Delta Queen. Way continued to be an active writer, collector of steamboat and packet ship photographs, and preserver of the history of boats on inland waterways. He started publishing the quarterly journal The S&D; Reflector for the SDPR organization in March 1964. He died on October 3, 1992 in Marietta, Ohio. His cremains were taken to Sewickley for burial next to his beloved Grace by the Str. Delta Queen.

He could not see a ladder up and called for help; the owner of the house came with a ladder and they found a treasure, which Cienzo refused to take part of and went on. Another time, he crossed a river to find a fairy being attacked by robbers; he helped her, but refused to come to her palace to be rewarded. He came to a town where a seven-headed dragon devoured a maiden every day, and now the lot had fallen the princess, Menechella. He went to fight the dragon, found its heads reattached themselves, but cut them all off with one blow, cut off their tongues, and threw them about the countryside, where they were too far apart. The king declared that whoever had killed the dragon would marry his daughter. A countryman gathered all the heads and claimed the prize. Cienzo wrote a letter to the princess and had his dog deliver it. The king had the dog followed back to Cienzo, who revealed that the heads that the man had brought as proof were missing the tongues, which he had.

The carriage is raised with hydraulic power. It is also equipped with a two-speed mechanism for elevation. The gun barrel is 152 mm caliber, and is rifled. The length of the barrel (including muzzle brake) is 8,197 mm (27 ft). The carriage is forked and suspended.  Modernization  Currently operational 2A36s have been modernizedhttp://www.armstrade.org/includes/periodics/news/2018/1119/095049678/detail.shtml and are equipped with: * Battery * \\"NAP\\" satellite positioning unit  Satellite receiver  Antenna unit * Self-orientating gyroscopic angle- measuring system * Computer * Mechanical speed gauge  Ammunition  The gun uses separate-loading cased charges. * VOF39 with OF-29 fragmentation shell. This shell weighs 46 kg and contains 6.73 kg of Hexal (A-IX-2). * ZVOF86 with the OF-59 rocket-assisted projectile, which can destroy targets at ranges up to 30‚Äì33 km. * nuclear ammunition of the 0.1-0.2 kiloton yield range. * cargo shell 30-13 able to carry dumb and smart submunitions, active and passive radio jamming. * anti-tank and smoke shells.  Dimensions  The gun is 12.92 m long in transport configuration and 12.30 m long in firing configuration. The height is 2.76 m (in transport configuration) and the under carriage is 2.34 m wide. The wheel diameter is 1.08 m, and the width of the wheel is 300 mm. Normal tire pressure is 470kPa.  Design history  The Perm Automobile Factory SKV started to develop a new 152 mm gun in November 1968, which was to have an extended range of fire. Two variants were planned from the beginning ‚Äì the towed version, 2A36 Giatsint-B, and the self-propelled variant, 2A37 or 2S5 Giatsint-S. The guns were field tested in 1971‚Äì1972, and deliveries to the Soviet Army began in 1975. Even today, the 2A36 represents the highest standards of modern artillery. It is reliable and mobile, and has great firepower.  Unit deployment  The guns are usually deployed in batteries of six to eight guns; promotional material claims that a battery can place more than 1 tonne of projectiles on a target in one minute. In Russian service, the gun is usually towed by a KrAZ-260 9 tonne 6√ó6 truck or by an artillery tractor, such as the AT-T, ATS-59, AT-S, or MT-T. When towed the carriage is supported by a four-wheel (two wheels on each side) walking beam suspension, permitting the gun to be towed over rough terrain at speeds up to 30 km/h (18.6 mp/h). In firing position the trail legs are split and the gun rests on a circular jack under the forward part of the carriage. This arrangement allows for gun traverse of 25 degrees to the left and right. Several types of trail spades are available to suit the season; the summer spades are larger to suit softer ground.

She won an Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine/MWA prize for her 1968 story Match Point in Berlin and was awarded the Grand Prix de Literature Policiere in 1952 for her 1951 novel Follow, As the Night (adapted as the 1954 film Bonnes √† tuer, aka One Step to Eternity). Her first novel, Pick Your Victim (1946), was selected as one of the Fifty Classics of Crime Fiction, 1900-1950.Lincoln City Library She was born in Falls City, Nebraska and grew up in Lincoln. She attended Immaculata Junior College in Washington D.C. before earning a bachelor's degree at University of Nebraska, Lincoln and a master's degree in journalism at Columbia University. She is principally known for having created a hitherto- unknown twist on the traditional whodunnit. Her best-known novel, Pick Your Victim (1946),Pick Your Victim as by Pat McGerr, Doubleday, 1946; Collins, 1947, also published as Dell mapback number #307. tells the story of a small group of American soldiers in an isolated Arctic base who are desperate for reading material and diversion. They find a torn scrap of newspaper which has arrived as the cushioning for a parcel. The torn scrap tells part of the story of a man who has been convicted of a murder, and who is known personally by one of the GIs‚Äîthe murderer is identified, but the name of the victim has been torn away. The GIs form a betting pool and pump their informant for every bit of information about any potential victim to enable them to better place their bets, and the story told by the informant is the body of the novel. At the end, the name of the victim is revealed. McGerr's other novels were sometimes ingenious but rarely commercially successful. The Seven Deadly Sisters (1947)The Seven Deadly Sisters, Doubleday, 1947; Collins, 1948, also published as Dell mapback #412 attempts a similar inversion of the whodunnit formula, with less success. The reader learns that one of seven sisters has murdered her husband, but which sister is not known until the end. Near the end of her writing career, McGerr created a continuing character, Selena Mead, who became involved in espionage-based plots in and around Washington, D.C. A television series based on McGerr's Selena Mead short stories was announced by CBS in November 1964. Polly Bergen was signed to play the title character. An eight- minute presentation film was produced but the series never materialized. The 1954 French film One Step to Eternity was based on one of her novels. McGerr also wrote the short story \\"Johnny Lingo and the Eight Cow Wife,\\" which was the basis for the 1969 movie Johnny Lingo made by the BYU Film Studio.Library thing list of McGerr's writing More recently, the 2003 film, The Legend of Johnny Lingo, was also based upon her story.

Acting roles in television, film, and theater were relatively few, and many available roles were for narrow, stereotypical characters. Early Asian American actors such as Sessue Hayakawa, Anna May Wong, and Bruce Lee encountered a movie-making culture and industry that wanted to cast them as caricatures. Some, like actress Merle Oberon, hid their ethnicity to avoid discrimination by Hollywood's racist laws. Asian Americans are rapidly gaining access to the American mainstream.Nee, Victor, and Hilary Holbrow. ‚ÄúWhy Asian Americans Are Becoming Mainstream.‚Äù Daedalus, vol. 142, no. 3, 2013, pp. 65‚Äì75. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/43297251. Recently, young Asian American comedians and filmmakers have also found an outlet on YouTube and the Internet, allowing them to gain a strong and loyal fanbase. Notable YouTubers include comedians such as Ryan Higa and Kevin Wu; entertainers such as Dan Chan and Christine Gambito; musicians such as MC Jin, Far East Movement, Sam Tsui, David Choi, and Kina Grannis; and the filmmaking group Wong Fu Productions. These entertainers have gained notable followings, mainly with young Asian American students, through solo and collaborative videos, short films and tours. Additionally, other Asian American artists have broken out into mainstream audiences beyond the Asian American community. Those include artists such as Bruno Mars, Darren Criss, and The Slants.  19th century  Chang and Eng Bunker had a stable career in entertainment. Cheng and Eng Buker were conjoined twins who rose to popularity known as the \\"Siamese Twins\\" in the 19th century. They were born in 1811 in a village sixty miles from Bangkok. Cheng and Eng were conjoined at the chest at birth, thus starting their career as a human spectacle. They were gawked at in their own country before coming to America at age eighteen. Touring city to city, they were well received, giving performances that featured their unique physiognomy and also highlighted their distinctive wit and innate intelligence. After ten years, at the age of twenty-eight, Chang and Eng retired and decided to settle down in Wilkes County in western North Carolina where they also adopted the surname \\"Bunker.\\" In North Carolina, they married sisters Sarah Anne and Adelaide Yates and began their lives as southern gentlemen by managing their individual households, plantations, and slaves. The former Siamese Twins from the countryside outside of Bangkok became the wealthiest men in the county and the patriarchs of two large families (between the two, there were twenty-one children). When need be, they returned to touring in order to accumulate more funds. In 1873, both Chang and Eng died at age sixty- two.http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=edspmu&AN;=edspmu.S2325689316100319&site;=eds- live&scope;=site Despite few Asian/Asian-American entertainers in the 19th century, many entertainment platforms attempt to depict accurate occurrences in 19th century Asia, such as Dunhuang Performative Arts company and their performances exhibiting the journey of the Silk Road in \\"Dunhuang, My Dreamland.\\" The show portrays Daoist priest Wang Yuanlu in accurate garb and performed by an appropriate actor, Chen Yizong. The playwright sets the stage at the Dunhunag Magao Caves which was historically important for travelers along the Silk Road, especially Buddhist monks from India and central Asia while on their journey to Chang'an (now Xi'an). Among meditations, the caves were used to reference the monastery's texts and records.http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=2b77d225-63bc-442f-8789-b6cceb49cf6a@sessionmgr4009&vid;=5&hid;=4203&bdata;=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ#AN=118830577&db;=ufh  Television  = Television actors / actresses = Anna May Wong was the first actor of Asian descent to be the leading star of an American television series when she starred on the television series The Gallery of Madame Liu- Tsong. Star Trek George Takei and Pat Morita became famous for supporting roles in Star Trek and Happy Days. In 1976, Morita starred on the first American sitcom centered on a person of Asian descent, Mr. T and Tina and went on to become widely known as the mentor Mr. Miyagi in The Karate Kid movies of the 1980s. Other Asian Americans from this period include Bruce Lee on The Green Hornet and Jack Soo of Barney Miller. Also noteworthy was Keye Luke, who portrayed Master Po on the television series Kung Fu, and was the voice of Charlie Chan on the 1972 animated series The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan, which featured a mystery solving Chinese American family. Margaret Cho Margaret Cho, stand-up comedian and actress, had a leading role in her own comedy series All-American Girl in the 1990s. Her character was a Korean- American (as is Cho), who struggled with her family and cultural issues in San Francisco. The series included other Asian American actors such as Amy Hill. Despite being groundbreaking in prime-time television, All American Girl was cancelled after one season due to low ratings. After its run, due to the way it was handled and the pressures that were forced on her to conform to vague mainstream expectations to try to make the series a success, Cho suffered a huge psychotic break and self-disappointment that led to her drug and alcohol addiction. (It would later be revealed that female stars of even successful sitcoms go through similar trials as related by Roseanne Barr in her story for New York Magazine in 2011.) Cho has since regained popularity and success from her 2000 one-woman show I'm the One That I Want and through her current involvement on Drop Dead Diva on Lifetime. Amy Hill has since been a mainstay of U.S. television for years as a recurring/character actress, some of her most notable roles include, Mrs. DePaulo on That's So Raven, Mama Tohru on Jackie Chan Adventures, Mrs. Hasagawa on Lilo & Stitch: The Series, Ah-Mah Jasmine Lee on The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, Judy Harvey on Enlightened, Mah Mah on American Dad!, Dr. Wagerstein on UnREAL, and now Lourdes Chan on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. Lucy Liu had a major role on the television series Ally McBeal from 1998 to 2002 where she was nominated for an Emmy Award. Liu now plays Joan Watson alongside Jonny Lee Miller (Sherlock Holmes) on Elementary. Chinese American actress Joan Chen had a major role on David Lynch‚Äôs cult classic television series Twin Peaks which ran from 1990 to 1991. Like many other original cast members, Chen also had scene in the prequel film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me which was deleted and later released in 2014 among with other deleted scenes in Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces. Chen does not her role as Josie Packard in the limited event series in 2017. Daniel Dae Kim and Sendhil Ramamurthy have achieved some recognition as sex symbols for their respective roles on Lost and has since moved onto Hawaii Five-0 and Heroes. Sendhil has moved onto the television series Covert Affairs and Beauty & the Beast. Although not an actor, Jon Gosselin has received from the reality series Jon and Kate Plus 8 sex symbol status. Masi Oka starred on the cast of the television series Heroes is also the only lead actor on the series to be nominated for either an Emmy Award or Golden Globe Award. Along with Ramamurthy and Oka, James Kyson Lee also starred on Heroes. BD Wong, who starred in the Broadway production of M. Butterfly and is the only actor to have won a Tony Award, a Drama Desk Award, an Outer Critics Circle Award, among others currently stars on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit after being featured in the series Oz. Asian American and Canadian actress Grace Park having rose to fame on Battlestar Galactica and Edgemont (from Canada) is now a cast member of Hawaii Five-0. Kal Penn was formerly a regular on the medical television series House M.D. in one of his best known roles and later recurred on How I Met Your Mother. Asian American actress Charlyne Yi was also a regular on House, and was with the series from 2011 until it ended. Maggie Q, of Vietnamese, Polish and Irish descent, who first rose to fame in Hong Kong achieved international fame when she starred as the title role on the television series Nikita.

She became a fashion icon during the silent film era, beginning with her success in the film The Toll of the Sea (1922), the first color feature to be made in Hollywood. During her career she sought roles that portrayed Chinese and Asian Americans in a positive light, but these films never became famous except for a select few such as the film Daughter of Shanghai (1937). Frustrated by being stereotyped and typecast during her career in the United States, she moved to Europe, where she appeared in many plays and films, the most notable of which was the British film Piccadilly (1929). She later returned to the United States in an ironic twist, at a time when American studios were searching Europe for fresh new talent, despite the fact that she is an American. She returned with promises of leading roles, but these did not come about due to racism in the United States. She eventually stopped acting in professional films and turned to stage, cabaret, B movies, and anti-Japanese propaganda films such as Bombs Over Burma (1943) due to her being an advocacy against the Japanese aggression in China. She was set to make her comeback with the film Flower Drum Song (1961) but was unable due to failing health.

His fame began during the silent film era, leading into sound pictures in his later life. He became a film actor in a somewhat reluctant and accidental manner when the famous producer Thomas Ince saw his theatre play The Typhoon and wanted to turn it into a silent film and when it was released the film was an instant hit. With rising stardom he was eventually offered film contract by Famous Players-Lasky now Paramount Pictures. His second film with the production company, The Cheat (1915), was a success and made him a romantic hit with U.S. female audiences. He became a leading man of romance films, considered a heartthrob and a sex symbol; many actresses wanted to work with him in films, in which he was often cast as the exotic male Asian lover that women desired. After years of being typecast as a villain and exotic Asian lover that white women could not have, he decided to start his own production company, where he eventually made 23 films; he produced, starred in, and directed them, and contributed to their design, writing and editing. His films also influenced the way the United States viewed Asians. He personally chose American actress Marin Sais to appear opposite him in his films such as The City of Dim Faces and His Birthright. Hayakawa's collaboration with Sais ended with the film Bonds of Honor (1919). In 1919, Hayakawa made what is generally considered one of his best films, The Dragon Painter. After some bad business, he left the United States and for the next 15 years he worked in Europe and Japan where he made many popular films and plays such as the films The Great Prince Chan and the play Samurai which he performed for the king and queen of the United Kingdom at that time King George V and Queen Mary and a stage play version of The Three Musketeers. His fame in France came from France's fascination with anything Asian. In the 1930s with the rise of Talkies and growing Anti-Japanese sentiment due to World War II.

After the war his image in films this time was as the honorable villain which he became typecasted as and from it he starred in what is considered to be his most famous film of his entire career The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) for which he was nominated for both an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award. On February 8, 1960, in a joint ceremony with Anna May Wong, Hayakawa became the first Asian American actor to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

And similar to the Bruceploitation phenomenon that followed Lee's death, many copy-cat ninja films were made following the worldwide popularity of Sho's early ninja films. A number of films produced in Hong Kong and Taiwan even used Sho's image on their posters and home video covers, despite the fact that Mr. Kosugi was not involved in these productions.

Disgraced, a play about Islamophobia, written by Pakistani American Ayad Akhtar won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Actors that have played the lead role include Aasif Mandvi and Hari Dhillon. Allegiance, which ran on Broadway from October 2015 to February 2016, is set during the Japanese American internment of World War II (with a framing story set in the present day), and was inspired by the personal experiences of George Takei, who stars in the musical along with Lea Salonga. Phillipa Soo starred as Natasha Rostova in Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812 in the Off-Broadway productions, and as Elizabeth Schuyler in the original Broadway cast of Hamilton, winning a cast Grammy Award for musical theater album. Kimiko Glenn starred as Dawn in the original Broadway cast of Waitress, the musical adaption of the film of the same name.  Fashion design  Many Asian Americans have made their mark in the fashion world. Vera Wang, friend to Anna Wintour, and Anna Sui have been working as highly accomplished and awarded fashion designers for years. Philippines-born Monique Lhuillier's dresses are on the Hollywood red carpet and Vietnamese- American Chloe Dao won Project Runway in spring 2006. Other designers include Phillip Lim, 2006 CFDA Emerging Talent Award Winner Doo-Ri Chung, and 2005 Winner Derek Lam; all three have been featured in Vogue magazine several times. At the Fashion Institute of Technology, 23 percent of the nearly 1,200 students now enrolled are either Asian or Asian American.  Internet  With the advent of YouTube, young Asian Americans have become more prominent, gaining large followings through filmmaking, comedy, or music. This includes video bloggers/comedians such as The Fung Brothers, Kevin Wu, Anna Akana, Ryan Higa and the filmmaking group Wong Fu Productions. The latter's growing influence is evident especially in Wong Fu Productions' annual concert series, International Secret Agents (ISA), which often sell out, and in which many popular Asian American guest performers appear, including Far East Movement or Poreotics. Kevin Wu's recent appearance on the 17th season of The Amazing Race marked another significant venture into mainstream media. These along with other rising Asian American talents have shared and documented their journey in Asian American blogs, including channelAPA.com Amped Asia magazine, Hyphen magazine, and Mochi. Raks Geek, founded by Chinese/Singaporean American Dawn Xiana Moon is a majority Asian-American bellydance and fire performance company best known for their bellydancing Wookiee viral video and other cosplay/nerd-themed dance work. The group's diverse roster features Hmong and Filipino performers as well, and most have performed around the world. Brothers Jimmy Wong and Freddie Wong also own popular YouTube channels, with the former acting in and the latter producing the web series Video Game High School. Mark Edward Fischbach is another example of a popular Asian American on YouTube. His YouTube channel and name online, Markiplier, is dedicated to gaming videos and comedy. With about 20 million subscribers and his channel reaching about 9 billion total views, Markiplier's internet fame has helped him raise over 3 million dollars for charity. In 2016, Markiplier won the Make-A-Wish Foundation's celebrity of the year award alongside voice actor Tom Kenny and the Dallas Cowboys football team.  Literature  Asian American writers have received numerous top awards in fiction and nonfiction writing. Women writers have been particularly prominent for their work of telling a wide range of stories of immigrant experience, changing cultures and aspects of Asian American imagination, spanning continents, eras and points of view. Maxine Hong Kingston won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1976 for her memoir The Woman Warrior. Hisaye Yamamoto received an American Book Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1986. Bharati Mukherjee won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1988 for her short story collection The Middleman and Other Stories. Amy Tan has received popular acclaim for The Joy Luck Club which was adapted into a critically acclaimed film. Jessica Hagedorn received a 1990 American Book Award for her novel Dogeaters. Several writers have received the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award for best debut book of fiction, including Chang-Rae Lee for the novel Native Speaker, Ha Jin for the short story collection Ocean of Words, Jhumpa Lahiri for the short story collection Interpreter of Maladies, Akhil Sharma for the novel An Obedient Father, and Yiyun Li for the short story collection A Thousand Years of Good Prayers. Further, Jin received the National Book Award for Fiction for his novel Waiting and Lahiri received a 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her Interpreter of Maladies. Viet Thanh Nguyen received the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for The Sympathizer. Asian American writers have also received several awards for young-adult fiction. Linda Sue Park and Cynthia Kadohata received the Newbery Medal for A Single Shard and Kira-Kira, respectively. Thanhha Lai received the National Book Award for Young People's Literature for the verse novel Inside Out & Back Again and Kadohata received the award for The Thing About Luck.  Music  = Rock = William David Chin, nicknamed \\"Charlie Chin\\", was the guitarist for Cat Mother's & the All Night Newsboys. His nickname, \\"Chop Chop\\" or \\"Charlie\\", was given to him as one of the only children of Asian kid on Uppereast Side. In the Rolling Stone, Ben Fong-Torres wrote that he was \\"the only Chinese in rock\\" at the time. In addition, late guitarist Eddie Van Halen is a renowned musician with Asian roots; his mother was of Indonesian ethnic origin. = Hip hop and R&B; = Asian Americans are increasingly enjoying success in mainstream hip hop and R&B; such as MC Jin. A few notable examples are multi-racial Amerie, Cassie, Ne-Yo, who is one- quarter Chinese, Filipino-American Nicole Scherzinger who is of Filipino, Hawaiian, and Ukrainian descent apl.de.ap of The Black Eyed Peas, and Jin. There are many more Asian Americans represented in local hip-hop scenes, including rising acts like Baiyu and the Blue Scholars. In 2010 and 2011, half-Filipino singer-songwriter Bruno Mars broke into the Top 10 with his singles \\"Just the Way You Are\\" and \\"Grenade\\". In 2018, he became the second unaccompanied Asian American artist to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In October 2010, Far East Movement became the first Asian American band to break into the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 with their single \\"Like a G6\\", which eventually reached No. 1. Jay Park's fourth album \\"Everything You Wanted\\", released in 2016, charted at #3 on Billboard's World album chart as well as #3 on iTune's U.S. R&B; chart. In the westernmost and southernmost major U.S. city Honolulu, the 50th U.S. state of Hawaii's Jason Tom perpetuates the hip hop vocal art of beatboxing and is ranked as one of the top 150 professional vocal percussion artists in the world. = Desi hip hop = There are also major underground hip hop artists who have developed a following, such as the Pakistani American rapper Bohemia who is known as the creator of Punjabi rap music. There is a genre of music called Desi hip hop due to its contributions and influences by many nations including the US by the South Asian diaspora including South Asian Americans especially by pioneers such as Pakistani-American Bohemia himself. Desi hip hop is one of only two music genres to have been either created by Asian Americans or have been contributed to musically by the community (in this case South Asian Americans) to the genre. = Asian American Jazz = Asian American jazz is a musical genre and movement in the United States begun in the 20th century by Asian American jazz musicians that has produced a number of very prominent artists. Along with Desi Hip Hop who has many origins including the USA it is currently one of only two musical genres to have been created by Asian Americans or been influenced by them. Some Asian-American Jazz artists are Toshiko Akiyoshi (piano), Vijay Iyer (piano), Rudresh Mahanthappa (alto saxophone), Jon Jang (piano), Tiger Okoshi (trumpet), Yasushi Nakamura (bass), Connie Han (piano), and Hitomi Oba (tenor saxophone). = Popular music = Norah Jones is an Indian American Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, pianist, keyboardist, guitarist, and actress In popular music, Asian Americans are a sizable influence, including pop divas such as part-Filipino Vanessa Hudgens, Utada Hikaru, and Lea Salonga. Folk singer-songwriter and Dawn Xiana Moon was the first to blend traditional Chinese music with Americana, pop, and jazz in the mid-2000s, and Vienna Teng is notable for a folk pop without the Eastern influences. Asian Americans play in a handful of \\"all-American\\" bands, including quarter-Indonesian Eddie Van Halen, James Iha of The Smashing Pumpkins, Korean American bassist and a founding member of the progressive metal group Dream Theater John Myung, Keralan Indian Kim Thayil of Soundgarden, part-Filipino Kirk Hammett of Metallica, Japanese-born Satomi Matsuzaki, bassist and vocalist of experimental rock band Deerhoof, Kazu Makino the Japanese-American singer and guitarist of the indie rock band Blonde Redhead, Japanese bassist and singer Toko Yasuda of Enon, Cambodian- born singer Chhom Nimol of Dengue Fever, Dustin Wong from Ponytail, Indian Tony Kanal of No Doubt, half-Japanese Miki Berenyi of Lush, John Famiglietti of HEALTH, Richard On of O.A.R., Joey Santiago of Pixies, Kenny Choi of Daphne Loves Derby, Hoobastank's Doug Robb and former member Derek Kwan, and Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda a Japanese American and Joseph Hahn, a Korean American. The main vocalist of American independent electronic music duo Knower Genevieve Artadi is Filipino American. Mike Park is prominent in the independent music sphere as a member of Skankin' Pickle, The Bruce Lee Band, and The Chinkees, as well as being the founder of Asian Man Records. Don Ho was a Grammy Award-winning Hawaiian pop singer and entertainer. Tia Carrere is a Hawaiian singer, actress, and former model best known as Cassandra Wong in the Wayne's World movies and for her leading role on the television series Relic Hunter; her album Hawaiiana was nominated for an Grammy. Singer- songwriter Norah Jones is also very successful. Nadia Ali, singer-songwriter and the former front-woman of iiO is prominent in the electronic dance music genre, with her work having attained both critical and commercial success. Internationally, US-born Leehom Wang is a well-known musician in mainland China and Taiwan, and also played a part in Ang Lee's 2007 film Lust, Caution. In the heavy metal genre, Aja Kim, has achieved notoriety as lead vocalist in the role of Bruce 'Lee' Chickinson for the tribute band, The Iron Maidens. Also US-born is singer Ailee, whose captivating voice caught the attention of Korean R&B; singer, Wheesung. Her vocal prowess and captivating voice won her many awards and is the reason she is dubbed the \\"Korean Beyonce.\\" There are also bands like the indie pop duo Cibo Matto, Run River North that plays folk- influenced rock and The Slants, that make pop-rock and are best known for their landmark trademark case against the United States Patent and Trademark Office). = Classical = Yo-Yo Ma, world renowned cellist In classical music, cellist Yo-Yo Ma and conductor Zubin Mehta are examples of significant Asian American figures. The classical violinists Sarah Chang and Midori Got≈ç have each been awarded the prestigious Avery Fisher Prize, as has Ma. The composer Bright Chang has received extensive recognition for his work, including being invited to be composer-in-residence at the New York City Ballet. Hunan, China-born New York City resident Tan Dun is a contemporary classical composer, well known for his Grammy and Oscar-award-winning scores for the movies Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero.  Fine Arts  = Painting = Asian American art is one of the last genres to be added to modern day collections; however, many notable painters have drawn inspiration from art techniques of Asian-origin. In the 19th century, painters like Whistler and Van Gogh used various Japanese works as models for their artwork. At the same time, many Japanese painters were moving to California to blend their work with what would become new Western Techniques. Asian American art can mostly be traced back to the West Coast with artists also popping up in New York. Paul Horiuchi was a Japanese-born American painter best known for his abstract collages of torn, hand-colored mulberry paper. Active in Seattle, he created the glass mural behind the Seattle Center amphitheater in 1962. Indian-American Faris McReynolds is a Los Angeles-based artist and musician. Sueo Serisawa helped establish the California Impressionist style of painting. Los Angeles-based artists James Jean and David Choe have received domestic and international recognition within the Lowbrow art scene. Martin Wong was a San Francisco and New York-based queer painter that made notable contributions to the 1980s East Village art scene. Wong was also involved with the growing New York graffiti art scene of this time and collected pieces from artists like Futura 2000 and Keith Haring. Unfortunately, the Japanese Internment Camps following WWII put a halt to a lot of Asian American artists. Art that resulted from this time serves as some of the only documentation of the trials and tribulations of the many Japanese Americans who were forced into camps. Roger Shimomura is a painter and printmaker whose works combine pop culture motifs, racial stereotypes, and evocations of his childhood experiences in the Minidoka internment camp during World War II. Abstract expressionism exploded onto the scene in the 1950s, drawing inspiration from calligraphy.Brown, Michael D. \\"Asian American Art.\\" Asian American Art. The Michael D. Brown Collection, 2015. Web. 2 December 2016. https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/31/obituaries/isamu-noguchi-the-sculptor-dies- at-84.html?pagewanted=1 = Sculpture = Isamu Noguchi was one of the most important American sculptors of the 20th century. Born in Los Angeles to a Japanese poet father and American writer mother, he spent most of his childhood in Japan, and his drew both from traditional Japanese aesthetics and international modernism. He worked many mediums, including clay, wood, and stainless steel, but is particularly associated with stone. In 1935 he began a career-long collaboration with dancer Martha Graham for whom he designed some 20 stage sets. Major works include the Unesco headquarters peace garden in Paris, the Sunken Garden for the Beinecke Library at Yale University, and the Billy Rose Sculpture Garden for the Israeli Museum in Jerusalem. George Tsutakawa was a Seattle-based painter and sculptor best known for his avant- garde bronze fountain designs. His son Gerard Tsutakawa, who apprenticed with his father, is a contemporary Pacific Northwest sculptor. = Curating = Herb Tam is the curator and director of exhibitions at the Museum of Chinese in America. = Book arts = Colette Fu is a pop-up book artist who designed China's largest pop-up book and was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to create pop-up book of the 25 ethnic minorities residing in Yunnan Province, China, from where her family descends. = Architecture = I. M. Pei, world-renowned architect Notable works of world architecture have been designed by Asian Americans, such as the Louvre Pyramid (I. M. Pei), the World Trade Center (Minoru Yamasaki), and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial (Maya Lin). In commercial architecture, Gyo Obata is a founding partner of HOK (formerly Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum), which designed the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. and the Taipei World Trade Center. Fazlur Rahman Khan designed the John Hancock Center and the Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower), both in Chicago. = Graphic artists = Larry Hama is best known as the original writer of the Marvel Comics GI Joe series. When he went to DC comics in the 1970s, he upended the long-standing tradition of coloring Asian characters yellow by confronting the head of the production department. As regarded by frequent speaker at the San Diego Comic Con, Gina Misiroglu, Jim Lee is one of the most popular comic book artist and one of the founders of Image Comics.http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=cat00322a&AN;=linus.b1457740&site;=eds- live&scope;=site Dave Halili (of Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, Pacific Islander and European heritage) is a contemporary American fine arts illustrator, graffiti writer and graphic designer of album cover paintings, posters, logos, T-shirts and other graphical merchandise. His best-known works are the CD /record covers for Ice-T and tour apparel for bands such as No Doubt, Stone Temple Pilots, Kurtis Blow, Fishbone and others. Asian Americans are gaining prominence in Los Angeles, the \\"Mural Capital of the World\\", including Nisha Sembi, Lady Aiko, Hueman, and Erin Yoshi. Lady Aiko is a well-known street artist who started out working for Takashi Murakami in Brooklyn until the late 1990s. She has international works installed in many cities including Miami's Wynwood Walls in 2009, New York City's Bowery Wall in 2013 and Coney Art Walls in 2015, 2016 and 2017.  Portrayal of Asian Americans in media  = The yellowface trend = The entertainment industry has created a negative discourse around the Asian American community, associating them, solely, with negative stereotypes such as the Dragon Lady, Fu Manchu, Charlie Chan, and foreigners. Implicit and explicit bias towards Asian Americans (AA's) leads to discrimination and thus results in an inaccurate representation and unequal employment in film, television, and society. The yellowface trend is one that is heavily impacting the employment of Asian Americans. As stated in University of San Francisco's Christina Shu Jien Chong's research journal, yellowfacing was a go-to tactic for casting directors as early as the 1970s. Yellowface is applying makeup on a white actor or actress to make him or her appear more Asian. When a storyline cannot be changed from Asian to White, non-Asians are typically hired and then yellowface. Yellowface is a topic many believe has become obsolete, yet, in recent years, it has become more and more prominent; yet in today's society, in lieu of yellowface, casting directors are now blatantly opting for white actors and actresses over Asian American ones. The 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's received near-universal condemnation for Mickey Rooney's yellowface portrayal of I. Y. Yunioshi. More recently, in 2009, Justin Chatwin, a white actor, portrayed an anime character, Goku, in Dragonball: Evolution. In 2011, Noah Ringer, also a white actor, portrayed an Eastern Asian monk in The Last Airbender. In 2013, Clifton Collins, Jr., a Mexican-American actor, portrayed a Chinese-American character, Tendo Choi, in Pacific Rim.http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=a9h&AN;=118642305&site;=eds- live&scope;=site In 2015, Emma Stone, a white actress, portrayed a local Hawaiian character, Allison Ng, in Aloha. The most recent account of historical yellowface was in Disney on Ice's 2015 Dare to Dream production, in which Li Shang, a Chinese general from Mulan, was cast as a white male who wore a black wig and painted slanted eyes. Other recent films that have whitewashed traditionally Asian characters include The Social Network, Star Trek Into Darkness, The Martian, Doctor Strange, Ghost in the Shell, 21 and Death Note. = Stereotyping of Asian Americans in film: Dragon lady / lotus flower dichotomy = Asian American characters and their representation in mainstream media, especially in the film and entertainment industry, are often one-dimensional and seriously lacking in depth. East Asian Americans in the film and media industry are often fetishized and exoticized, perpetuating damaging images of asian women as either the \\"dragon lady\\" or \\"lotus flower\\" dichotomy. An example is Lucy Liu's dragon lady character O-Ren Ishii in Kill Bill, as well as Anna May Wong's character in Daughter of the Dragon. According to author Kent Ono, \\"Usually yellow peril discourse constructs and Asian-white dialectic emphasizing the powerful, threatening potential of Asians and Asian Americans, while simultaneously constructing whites as vulnerable, threatened, or otherwise in danger.\\" These limiting and offensive roles offered to Asian Americans further the US's exoticism and fetishism of Asian women, leading to terms such as \\"yellow fever\\".http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=0822f2f7-74a9-454e-8dfc-69757154c022@sessionmgr4007&vid;=0&hid;=4202&bdata;=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ#AN=1999-00186-003&db;=psyh According to Rosalind S. Chou in her book, Asian American Sexual Politics: The Construction of Race, Gender, and Sexuality, stereotypical portrayals of Asian Americans which lead to phenomenon's such as yellow fever can be particularly damaging to real life interracial relationships where she writes \\"it can be difficult to distinguish genuine interest from interest resting on fabricated constructions of an othered person.\\" South Asian portrayal in cinema often involve \\"Karma Sutra\\" type analogies or imagery, an example being white actor Mike Myers and his role as Pitka in the movie The Love Guru. = Model minority = In The New York Times Magazine in January 1966, Success Story, Japanese-American Style, the term \\"model minority\\" was coined by sociologist William Petersen. It was used in order to describe Japanese Americans as ethnic minorities who, despite marginalization, have achieved success in the United States. While it was first used to depict Japanese Americans, it has since evolved to characterize Asian Americans in general, specifically East Asians (i.e. Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) and the South Asian community. However, this concept has faced major criticism from the Asian American community. According to Asian Americans Advancing Justice ‚Äì Los Angeles, \\"the misperception that Asian Americans are doing fine on their own has serious policy implications...politicians won't talk about our community's needs if they assume people don't require assistance.\\" This stereotype is often portrayed in media, such as television and film. Characters such as George Huang in Law & Order: SVU, Cristina Yang in Grey's Anatomy, and Archie Kao in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation are all examples of this. In addition, in the second edition of her book, Unraveling the Model Minority Stereotype: Listening to Asian American Youth, Professor Stacy J. Lee argues that the ostensibly sterling stereotype was constructed to silence the charges of racial inequality and to delegitimize the protests of racial discrimination. Bob H. Suzuki also questions the validity of the stereotype, contending that it is only media hype, more myth than reality. Suzuki further argued that, deceptively flattering and favorable on the surface, the model minority stereotype is inaccurate, overgeneralized, and a liability for Asian Americans. The commendation of Asian Americans as a model minority implicitly denigrates other racial groups as well.

Terra-Gen bags $631m for more phases at California's Alta Wind Renewable Energy World, 29 July 2010. Overview Wind development in the Tehachapi Pass began in the early 1980s by James Dehlsen and Zond Corporation. The first set of wind turbines installed were of American-made Storm Master brand, however they proved troublesome and eventually had to be replaced. Dehlsen turned to Danish-built machines later, which now make up the majority of the turbines at the pass.The area hosts a multitude of wind farms, comprising one of California's largest wind resource areas. The pass is undergoing much repowering activity. The area has multiple generations of wind turbine technology installed, including both single and double-blade turbines, as well as the more modern three-blade horizontal axis design. The older generation turbines generate kilowatts, and the modern turbines installed generate up to 3 megawatts, depending on the specific turbine and manufacturer. The Tehachapi wind resource area is a net exporter of generation to other parts of the state of California. A state initiative to upgrade the transmission out of Tehachapi (Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project) began in 2008 and was expected to be completed by 2012. This has opened the door to further regional wind power development and multiple projects are expected to be installed to utilize that capacity. A prime location for viewing the turbines is off of State Route 58 and from Tehachapi-Willow Springs Road. Further development One proponent for further regional wind power development is Southern California Edison, which executed power purchase agreements for up to 1,500 megawatts (MW) or more of power generated from new projects to be built in the Tehachapi area, of which the Alta Wind Energy Center was developed. The 2006 contract, which more than doubles SCE‚Äôs wind energy portfolio, envisions more than of wind parks in the Tehachapi region, which is triple the size of any existing U.S. wind farm.Southern California Edison Signs Largest Wind Energy Contract in U.S. Renewable Industry History Other well-known wind turbine locations in California include the adjacent Alta Wind Energy Center, the Altamont Pass Wind Farm and the San Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm, near Palm Springs.

The Species at Risk Act (SARA) (the Act) is a piece of Canadian federal legislation which became law in Canada on December 12, 2002. It is designed to meet one of Canada's key commitments under the International Convention on Biological Diversity. The goal of the Act is to protect endangered or threatened organisms and their habitats. It also manages species which are not yet threatened, but whose existence or habitat is in jeopardy. SARA defines a method to determine the steps that need to be taken in order to help protect existing relatively healthy environments, as well as recover threatened habitats, although timing and implementation of recovery plans have limitations. It identifies ways in which governments, organizations, and individuals can work together to preserve species at risk and establishes penalties for failure to obey the law. The Act designates COSEWIC, an independent committee of wildlife experts and scientists, to identify threatened species and assess their conservation status. COSEWIC then issues a report to the government, and the Minister of the Environment evaluates the committee's recommendations when considering the addition of a species to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk. Recent controversies In July 2016, the Government of Canada issued an emergency order to stop the development of a 2 km2 area on the South Shore (Montreal), Quebec to protect the Western Chorus Frog, which by 2009 had seen a 90% decrease in its historical range. This action was opposed by the Government of Quebec, who perceived it as an overstepping of provincial jurisdiction. The emergency order stopped the development of 171 new residences that had been approved by the local municipalities and by the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (Quebec). 1000 residences are still permitted to be constructed. . The original approved plan included 35.5 hectares to be retained for Western Chorus Frog habitat and breeding ponds and for a conservation area. 87 hectares will now be set aside.

According to historian Brian Cutherburton, Uniacke was \\"the most influential Nova Scotian of his day.... His faith in Nova Scotia's destiny as a partner in a great empire was only to be equalled by Joseph Howe.\\"Brian Cuthbertson. The Old Attorney General: A Biography of Richard John Uniacke. Halifax: Nimbus Publishing, 1980. p. 133 He devoted 49 years to public service in Nova Scotia. He fought in the American Revolution and later sought to emancipate Catholics and Black Nova Scotians who were slaves in Nova Scotia.Julien Gwyn. Female Litigants before the Civil Courts of Nova Scotia, p. 341 He is buried in the crypt of St. Paul's Church. His substantial estate (c. 1813) is preserved as the Uniacke Estate Museum Park at Mount Uniacke.  Ireland  Born in Castletown, Ballintotis, Castlemartyr, County Cork, Ireland, located just four kilometres from the family estate of Mountuniacke, created by his grandfather, Captain James Uniacke.Brian Cuthbertson. The Old Attorney General: A Biography of Richard John Uniacke 175-1830. Nimbus Publishing Limited, Halifax, 1980. p. 2. Richard attended school at Lismore, County Waterford. At the age of sixteen he came under the influence of a Catholic priest and as this was abhorrent to his Protestant family, his father had him sent to Dublin where he was articled with the law firm of Thomas Garde. In Dublin Richard became fascinated with the movement for greater Irish political autonomy and he eventually joined with the Irish nationalists. This caused a rupture in the relationship with his father and being cut off from his allowance. Refusing to return home, Richard being penniless, prematurely abandoned his studies and decided to seek his fortune in Nova Scotia. (Uniacke would later return to Ireland to finish his law studies at King's Inns, Dublin.)Brian Cuthbertson. p. 7-11.  Nova Scotia  = American Independence = Uniacke In 1776, Uniacke joined the American rebels in the Battle of Fort Cumberland, despite the loyalty of his father-in-law Delesdernier. Under the leadership of Jonathan Eddy, American Rebels terrorized the local population who remained loyal to the British. Uniacke participated in some of these actions and while trying to commandeer supplies heading for the Fort he was captured. Shortly thereafter he was sent as a prisoner to Halifax. As a rebel, Uniacke faced being charged with treason. If found guilty, he would have been hanged. It is likely due to his family connections, the fact several military officers in Halifax had been stationed with several of his brothers, and the fact he provided evidence for the crown that led to his release.Nova Scotia Historical Society. 1878. p. 110 Uniacke, since the time of the Eddy Rebellion, had developed an animosity for the New England Planters, once stating they were \\" a race of the most lawless profligate and wicked monsters that exist on the face of the earth\\".Brian Cuthbertson. p. 10. Seven years later, after the American Revolution, Uniacke became a member of the House of Assembly for over twenty years (1783, 1785-1793; 1797-1805). In 1808 he was appointed to the Nova Scotia Council. = Catholic emancipation = Uniacke took up the cause of religious reform in Protestant-dominated Nova Scotia. In 1783 he redrafted a bill passed by the Nova Scotia House of Assembly to repeal the law passed in 1758 that had proscribed Catholics. The bill had been struck down by the British government. Uniacke's redraft was confirmed thus allowing Catholics to own land, build churches and hire priests. In 1786 Uniacke was one of the founding members of the Charitable Irish Society of Halifax; established to assist needy Irish regardless of whether they were Protestant or Catholic. In subsequent years Uniacke put forward additional amendments to laws which allowed Catholics to establish schools and to vote in elections. His efforts to bring about complete emancipation of Catholics continued until success was achieved through the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. = Abolition of Slavery = While many blacks who arrived in Nova Scotia during the American Revolution were free, others were not.Slavery in the Maritime Provinces Black slaves also arrived in Nova Scotia as the property of White American Loyalists. In 1772, prior to the American Revolution, Britain outlawed the slave trade in the British Isles followed by the Knight v. Wedderburn decision in Scotland in 1778. This decision, in turn, influenced the colony of Nova Scotia. Led by Uniacke, in 1787, 1789 and again on January 11, 1808 the Nova Scotian legislature refused to legalize slavery.Bridglal Pachai & Henry Bishop. Historic Black Nova Scotia. 2006. p. 8John Grant. Black Refugees. p. 31Brian Cuthbertson. p. 4. Uniacke defeated the efforts of James De Lancey to have slavery legally recognized in Nova Scotia. (The Slave Trade Act outlawed the slave trade in the British Empire in 1807 and the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 outlawed slavery altogether.) = Immigration = In his role as Attorney General, to continue Nova Scotia's economic growth, Uniacke worked to increase the number of immigrants coming to the colony. In part immigration had been hindered by the cancellation of free land grants. In 1806 Uniacke pushed for a renewal of the granting of land to settlers. Furthermore, he moved to escheat large tracts of land, from holders whose only intent was to speculate on the lands they held, feeling this had further slowed the influx of new settlers. By 1820 he had escheated . These lands then became available to the government which allowed them to provide new land grants to the many immigrants that landed in the Province after the Napoleonic wars. From 75,000 people in 1815, Nova Scotia's population reached 200,000 in 1838.Brian Cuthbertson. p. 70-71. = Education = Uniacke was also instrumental in the establishment in 1789 of King's College (see also King's Collegiate School) at Windsor, and he sat, despite being a non-Anglican, on its board. = Military service = Throughout the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, the threat of invasion was an every looming specter. To counter the threat Nova Scotia maintained a militia. In 1793 Uniacke was second-in-command of the Second Battalion of the militia and in 1794 was promoted to Lieutenant-colonel of the Eighth Battalion. = Murders = Both Uniacke and his son were charged with separate murders and both were acquitted. Jonathan Sterns accused Uniacke of being biased against Loyalists in the courts. Uniacke beat Jonathan Sterns so \\"savagely\\" that he died. Uniacke was acquitted (1798). Sterns was Sampson Salter Blowers' prot√©g√© who afterward challenged Uniacke to a duel which Uniacke accepted but then contacted the constables (see Halifax Regional Police) (1790).Cuthbertson, p. 26, 36 In 1819, Uniacke's son Richard John Uniacke, Jr. killed his opponent in a duel. He was tried for murder and acquitted. = Confederation = Uniacke was the first public figure to advocate for the Confederation of Canada, 51 years before it became a reality. He wanted to save the colonies from republicanism and atheism of the United States. As a result, Uniacke advocated unions of the Maritime colonies and of the Canadas, beginning in 1806 when he presented a memoir on British North America at the Colonial Office. In 1826 Uniacke brought his ‚ÄúObservations on the British colonies in North America with a proposal for the confederation of the whole under one government‚Äù to the Colonial Office. The ‚ÄúObservations‚Äù read in parts like the British North America Act of 40 years later.  Family  In 1774 he travelled from Ireland to the West Indies and then arrived in Philadelphia. In Philadelphia, he was recruited by Moses Delesdernier to settle the Hopewell Township in Nova Scotia (present-day Hopewell Cape, New Brunswick). The following spring both moved to Hopewell. On May 3, 1775 Uniake married Delesderneir's daughter Martha Maria, then aged 12. They would have eleven children before her death in 1803.Brian Cuthbertson. p. 44. In 1808 he married Eliza Newton, who bore him a son in 1809.Brian Cuthbertson. p. 50. He had twelve children, three sons became lawyers and one became a priest. His son James Boyle Uniacke was a lawyer and the first Premier of Nova Scotia. Another son, Richard John Uniacke, Jr. was a lawyer, Attorney General of the colony of Cape Breton, judge, and political figure who represented Cape Breton County (after Cape Breton was re-incorporated into Nova Scotia) in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1820 to 1830. His son Norman Fitzgerald Uniacke studied law in Nova Scotia and in 1798 furthered his law studies in London, entering the law at Lincoln's Inn; the second Nova Scotian to do so. In 1808 he was appointed the Attorney General of Lower Canada, was elevated to the Lower Canada Bench in 1825, and served in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, in later years he joined Nova Scotia's Legislative Council. Norman, as well as his father, were sympathetic to the French Canadians, and from his position on the Bench shielded the captive rebels of the Lower Canada Rebellion from the full brunt of the \\"bloodhounds of prosecution\\".Brian Cuthbertson. p. 110. His youngest son Andrew Mitchell Uniacke practiced law in the family firm. Crofton Uniacke practiced law in the family firm, in 1808 was appointed Receiver of Quit Rents, and in 1817 assumed the judgeship of the retiring Justice Croke, only to resign the position in 1819 when he moved to England where he practiced law. Uniacke's son Robert Fitzgerald Uniacke, did not follow his brothers into the law; instead, with his father's blessing, he took a path into the church, becoming minister at St. George's Church, Halifax. = St. Paul's Church, Halifax = The family of Richard John Uniacke dominates the plaques and monuments in St. Paul's Church (Halifax).

Long part of Elizabeth City County, the site is now located in the independent city of Hampton, Virginia. After Captain John Smith, President of the Council at Jamestown was deposed in September 1609 and soon returned to England, Captain James Davis, who arrived with one of the ships of the Third Supply, assumed command of the newly built fort in October. It is likely that his pinnace, Virginia, the first ship built in the English colonies (at the Virginia Company of Plymouth's failed Popham Colony in present-day Maine), was anchored nearby. The fort was very close to the Kecoughtans village, and in one of the acts leading to the First Anglo- Powhatan War, this village was attacked and captured by the English on July 9, 1610, who built then there another fort, named Fort Charles.

The impact parameter b is defined as the perpendicular distance between the path of a projectile and the center of a potential field U(r) created by an object that the projectile is approaching (see diagram). It is often referred to in nuclear physics (see Rutherford scattering) and in classical mechanics. The impact parameter is related to the scattering angle \\\\theta byLandau LD and Lifshitz EM (1976) Mechanics, 3rd. ed., Pergamon Press. (hardcover) and (softcover). :\\\\theta=\\\\pi-2b\\\\int_{r_\\\\mathrm{min}}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{dr}{r^2\\\\sqrt{1-(b/r)^2-2U/mv_\\\\infty^2}} where v_{\\\\infty} is the velocity of the projectile when it is far from the center, and r_\\\\mathrm{min} is its closest distance from the center. Scattering from a hard sphere The simplest example illustrating the use of the impact parameter is in the case of scattering from a sphere. Here, the object that the projectile is approaching is a hard sphere with radius R. In the case of a hard sphere, U(r) = 0 when r > R, and U(r) = \\\\infty for r \\\\leq R . When b > R , the projectile misses the hard sphere. We immediately see that \\\\theta = 0. When b \\\\leq R, we find that b = R \\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right).  Collision centrality  In high-energy nuclear physics ‚Äî specifically, in colliding-beam experiments ‚Äî collisions may be classified according to their impact parameter. Central collisions have b\\\\approx0, peripheral collisions have 0, and ultraperipheral collisions have b>2R, where the colliding nuclei are viewed as hard spheres with radius R. Because the color force has an extremely short range, it cannot couple quarks that are separated by much more than one nucleon's radius; hence, strong interactions are suppressed in peripheral and ultraperipheral collisions. This means that final-state particle multiplicity is typically greatest in the most central collisions, due to the partons involved having the greatest probability of interacting in some way. This has led to charged particle multiplicity being used as a common measure of collision centrality (charged particles are much easier to detect than uncharged particles). Because strong interactions are effectively impossible in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs), they may be used to study electromagnetic interactions ‚Äî i.e. photon-photon, photon-nucleon, or photon-nucleus interactions ‚Äî with low background contamination. Because UPCs typically produce only two- to four final-state particles, they are also relatively \\"clean\\" when compared to central collisions, which may produce hundreds of particles per event.

It is sometimes associated with the Komariv neighbouring culture, as the Trzciniec-Komariv culture. History The Trzciniec culture developed from three Corded Ware-related cultures: Mierzanowicka, Strzy≈ºowska and Iwie≈Ñska. The areal of the Trzciniec culture corresponds to parts of today's Poland (including Kujawy, Ma≈Çopolska, Mazowsze, South Podlasie) and western Ukraine. The Trzciniec culture was succeeded by the Lusatian culture, which developed around ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Characteristics The best known settlements of the Trzciniec culture were in Z≈Çota Pi≈Ñczowskia, Wiƒôc≈Çawice ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie, Goszyce, and west Bondyrz, close to the kurgans of Guciow. Some of these sites include important treasures containing materials such as ornamental gold and silver like in Stawiszyce and Rawa Mazowiecka. Inhumation and cremation in a flat grave were important features of Trzciniec culture. Cases of inhumation were discovered in Wolica Nowa, in the form of kurgans. Evidence of kurgan inhumation have been found at ≈Åubna-Jakusy, whereas kurgan cremation has been found at Guci√≥w. Genetics A genetic study published in Nature Communications in January 2018 examined the remains of seven possible Trzciniec individuals buried in Turloji≈°kƒó, Lithuania between 2,100 BC and 600 BC. The three samples of Y-DNA extracted belonged to haplogroup R1a1a1b (two samples) and CT, while the seven samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to haplogroup U5a2a1, T2b (three samples), H5, H4a1a1a3 and H. A genetic study published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology in April 2020 examined the mtDNA of eighty individuals ascribed to the Trzciniec culture. The individuals were determined to be closely related to peoples of the Corded Ware culture, Bell Beaker culture, Unetice culture and the Mierzanowice culture. They were notably genetically different from peoples of the neighboring Strzy≈º√≥w culture, which displayed closer genetic relations to cultures further east.

It is not marketed in Europe.  History  Omniflox was approved to treat lower respiratory tract infections, genital and urinary infections like prostatitis, and skin infections in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration in January 1992. Severe adverse reactions, including allergic reactions and hemolytic anemia, developed in over 100 patients during the first four months of its use, leading to three patient deaths. Abbott withdrew the drug from sale in June 1992.  Pharmacokinetics  Following oral administration the compound is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The oral bioavailability is greater than 90%. Temafloxacin has a good tissue penetration in various biological fluids and tissues, particularly in the respiratory tissues, nasal secretions, tonsils, prostate and bone. In these districts the concentrations achieved are equal to or higher than those in serum. The fluoroquinolone has a 7-8 hour half-life. The penetration into the central nervous system (CNS)is less pronounced. The excretion from the body is primarily due to glomerular filtration in the kidneys.  Clinical uses  The compound was indicated for treating lower respiratory tract infections (community-acquired pneumonia, exacerbations of chronic bronchitis), genital and urinary tract infections (prostatitis, gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis, cervicitis), skin and soft tissue infections.

She maintained a correspondence with Queen Elizabeth, and also corresponded with contacts sympathetic to the Roman Catholic cause in England. Within Spain she championed the cause of exiled English fallen on hard times. On her husband's death in 1571 she took over the management of his estates. She died in Spain on 13 January 1612 and was buried at the monastery of Santa Clara in Zafra. Early life Jane Dormer, born at Eythrope near Waddesdon, Buckinghamshire on 6 January 1538, the daughter of Sir William Dormer (d. 17 May 1575) of Wing, Buckinghamshire, by his first wife, Mary Sidney (died 10 February 1542), the daughter of Sir William Sidney of Penshurst, Kent, and Anne Pakenham. She had two brothers, Thomas Dormer and Robert Dormer, and a sister, Anne Dormer, who married Sir Walter Hungerford. She was the granddaughter of Sir Robert Dormer (died 2 or 8 July 1552) and Jane Newdigate, the daughter of John Newdigate (d. 15 August 1528), esquire, of Harefield, Middlesex, by Amphyllis Neville (d. 15 July 1544). Jane Newdigate's brother was the Roman Catholic martyr, Sebastian Newdigate. Jane Dormer was born during the reign of Henry VIII, when her family was split by the religious controversy caused by the ongoing Reformation. On the one side, her father Sir William Dormer's family (moderately prosperous Buckinghamshire landowners and wool merchants) remained staunchly Roman Catholic. However, her mother Mary Sidney's family embraced Protestantism. Jane was raised broadly outside this latter influence from the death of her mother in 1542, but she spent her youth not only in the household of her paternal grandmother but also as a playmate of the young Edward VI, who, she wrote in her memoirs, was very fond of her and reportedly said after having beaten her at cards, \\"Now your king is gone Jane, I shall be good enough for you\\". Marriage and family Jane's faith and royal connections would take her to the heart of power. Despite an age gap of over 20 years and at the age of just 16, Jane became one of Queen Mary I's closest friends and confidantes. Queen Mary was reluctant to see her married, so she could stay at court. Edward Courtenay showed interest, amongst others, but Mary deemed him unworthy. In the end she made her own Spanish match by marrying Don Gomez Suarez de Figueroa of Cordova, Duke of Feria, a close confidante of Philip II of Spain and his first ambassador to Elizabeth I's court.Note: \\"Don\\", in this article, is used as a title, as in \\"Sir\\". It is not a first name, and is ordinarily written as \\"D\\" or \\"don\\"--i.e., D. Gomez Suarez de Figueroa y Cordova, Duke of Feria. Gomez was the Duke's first name. Gomez may also be a surname. Jane and Don Gomez had first met on King Philip's arrival in England in 1554; Mary had strongly encouraged the match, but it had been postponed to await Philip's return to the country after campaigns abroad. This never occurred, and the two were not married until after Mary's death in 1558. The Duke and Duchess of Feria's union had two sons: Lorenzo Su√°rez de Figueroa y C√≥rdoba (born in 1559), who would succeed his father as Duke of Feria, and Pedro (born in 1565; lived only three months). The Duke of Feria was quick to perceive how Elizabeth's accession would change the religious tide in England and, despite his formal role as Spanish ambassador, he refused to attend Elizabeth's coronation in a public rejection of expected Protestant elements in the service. Spain When the Duke of Feria was replaced as ambassador in 1559, he and Jane returned to the continent with a mixed retinue of monks and nuns, her cousin Margaret Harington, and Susan Clarencieux who was one of Mary's former ladies-in-waiting. Once in Spain, Jane became a lightning rod for exiled English Catholics. Jane kept up her correspondence with Elizabeth, but she also received letters from four popes and maintained numerous other contacts sympathetic to the Roman Catholic cause in England, and within Spain she was a champion of exiled English fallen on hard times. On her husband's death in 1571 she took over the management of his estates. The Spanish respected her for her political understanding, and 1592 she was a strong candidate to take up the governorship of Flanders. Death and legacy The Duchess's health never recovered from an accident in 1609, and she was bedridden from the start of 1611 ‚Äì planning ahead she had already prepared a coffin which she kept in the house. At her death on 13 January 1612, she was attended by seven priests. She was buried at the monastery of Santa Clara in Zafra on 26 January. Her son Lorenzo Su√°rez de Figueroa y C√≥rdoba succeeded his father as Duke of Feria.

Flanked by Mount San Gorgonio and the Transverse Ranges to the North, and Mount San Jacinto and the Peninsular Ranges to the South, the San Gorgonio Pass is a transitional zone from a Mediterranean climate west of the pass, to a Desert climate east of the pass. This makes the pass area one of the windiest places in the United States. Development of the wind farm began in the 1980s. It is one of three major wind farms in California, along with those at Altamont and the Tehachapi passes. Utilities As of January 2008, the farm consists of 3,218 units delivering 615 MW.U.S. Wind Energy Projects ‚Äì California A single Southern California Edison Path 46 500 kilo-volt power line crosses the pass on the northern edge of San Jacinto Peak. This line links the Los Angeles metropolitan area with the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant. History and governance Drew R. Oliver, president of the Oliver Electric Power Corporation, was the earliest to promote the idea of generating electricity from wind in the San Gorgonio Pass area. In 1926 Oliver, in collaboration with electrician W. Sperry Knighton, built a wind turbine near Whitewater. The original device used a generator Oliver had salvaged from an old roller coaster at Seal Beach, California. Oliver and Sperry fitted the generator with aluminum propellers, and placed a large funnel on the front to concentrate the wind's power. They set the entire device on a circular rail that allowed it to be pivoted to face prevailing winds. The powerful wind quickly burned out the 25,000 watt unit, but a larger unit was obtained from the Pacific Electric substation in Los Angeles. After the two worked out other mechanical issues, Oliver set out to raise funds to expand the enterprise, with the vision of powering all of nearby Palm Springs. Oliver incorporated the Oliver Electric Power Corporation in Reno, Nevada, began selling stock in the company, but quickly ran afoul of newly enacted California Corporate Security Laws. Oliver was jailed for a short time, then placed on two years probation, but his plans proceeded no further. The device he had built near Whitewater became a landmark and curiosity until it was taken down and sold for scrap in 1942. In 1982 wind energy development in the San Gorgonio Pass area was formally studied, and the results published in the San Gorgonio Wind Resource Study EIR (1982), a joint environmental document prepared for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and Riverside County. The document assessed three scenarios for wind energy development in the area and included criteria for the development of wind energy on both a countywide basis and specifically for the San Gorgonio Pass area. Since 1982, and the approval of wind energy development in the San Gorgonio Pass, numerous wind turbines have become part of the landscape. The narrow turbines range from to in height.U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT DOI-BLM-CA-060-0007-0057-EA A 2008 proposal details an upgrade to the facilities to begin construction by September 2011. The proposed project would replace the 460 existing wind turbines with 30 new turbines, in two phases. Phase 1 would remove approximately 74 non-operational turbines and install up to fifteen new 1.5 MW GE SLE wind turbines. Phase 2 would remove approximately 384, Vestas V15, 65kW turbines and install an additional fifteen, 1.5 MW GE SLE wind turbines. The proposed project would therefore comprise a total of 30 wind turbines, 330 feet tall.

Description Growing to tall by broad, it is a rosette-forming succulent evergreen perennial, spreading by offsets. It has grey-green, tufted, sessile leaves, in diameter, which are often suffused with rose-red. In summer it bears clusters of reddish-purple flowers, in multiples of 8-16, on hairy erect flat-topped stems. The species is highly variable, in part because hundreds of cultivars have been propagated, sold, and traded for nearly 200 years. Sempervivum tectorum was described in 1753 by Linnaeus, who noted that its leaves are ciliate, that is, fringed with hairs. Names This plant has been known to humans for thousands of years, and has attracted many common names and traditions. In addition to common houseleek, names include variations of the following:- *bullock's beard *devil's beard *earwort *fuet *healing blade *homewort *imbroke *Jove's beard *Jupiter's eye *poor Jan's leaf *red- leaved houseleek *roof foil *roof houseleek *St. George's Beard *St. Patrick's cabbage *sengreen *Thor's beard *thunderplant *Welcome-home-husband- though-never-so-drunk--a name it sometimes shares with Sedum acre. *hen and chicks - a name shared with several other plants The specific epithet tectorum means \\"of house roofs\\", referring to a traditional location for these plants. Cultivation S. tectorum is one of several houseleek species to be cultivated. It is valued as groundcover for hot, dry places. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Folklore and herbalism The plant has been traditionally thought to protect against thunderstorms, and grown on house roofs for that reason, which is why it is called House Leek. Many of its popular names in different languages reflect an association with the Roman thunder-god Jupiter, notably the Latin barba Jovis (Jupiter's beard), referred to in the Floridus traditionally attributed to Aemilius Macer, and its French derivative joubarbe, which has in turn given rise to jubard and jo-barb in English; or with the Norse thunder-god Thor as in German Donnerbart.; however, states that Donner-bart is sedum telephium. It is also called simply thunder-plant.. Anglo-Saxon √æunorwyrt, glossing it as \\"Thunder-plant\\". may have either meaning. However, the association with Jupiter has also been derived from a resemblance between the flowers and the god's beard; in modern times, it has also been called St. George's beard. The hairs that fringe the leaves can be seen on close inspection Other common names, such as Anglo-Saxon singrƒìne, Modern English sigrim, sil-green, etc. and aye-green, refer to its longevity. William Fernie tells a tale in support of this: It has been believed to protect more generally against decay and against witchcraft. Jacob Grimm quotes a Proven√ßal troubadour: \\"e daquel erba tenon pro li vilan sobra lur maiso\\" ‚Äî \\"and that plant they keep against evil atop their house.\\" In his Capitulare de villis vel curtis imperii, Charlemagne recommended it be grown on top of houses. ‚Äî ; however, \\"Barba Iovis\\", in says he recommended including it in the garden as a domestic remedy. In some places, S. tectorum is still traditionally grown on the roofs of houses. The juice has been used in herbal medicine as an astringent and treatment for skin and eye diseases, including by Galen and Dioscorides, to ease inflammation and, mixed with honey, to treat thrush; however, large doses have an emetic effect. Pliny also mentions it, and Marcellus Empiricus listed it as a component in external treatments for contusions, nervous disorders, intestinal problems and abdominal pain, and mixed with honey, as part of the antidotum Hadriani (Hadrian's antidote), a broad-spectrum palliative for internal complaints. Romans grew the plant in containers in front of windows and associated it with love medicine.

It mined approximately 40 km¬≤ or 40,000 ha of which 25 to 30 km¬≤ or 25,000 to 30,000 ha of land have been mined with a timespan of 37 years, it is the largest mine in the Peloponnese and Southern Greece and is ranked near Amyntaio and after Ptolemaida. Coal is shipped on the west side, the shipping truck-only roads are in the middle of the mine. History The mine began in the 1970s and continues to expand until the plant closure in which the date is not yet set. The mine removed the settlement of Psatha 2 km east to near Megalopoli and Anthochori in which the moving the settlement is unknown. It also changed the Alfeios River course to south and west of the mines in which used to run through Psatha as well as another river to the northeast and at that time formed a tributary at Tripotamo in which it receives the settlement name. The expansion of the mine removed the Megalopoli-Vastas Road, the Megalopoli-Sparta Road and the GR-7 to the south and east, at that time, the mine became the largest in all of the Peloponnese. The Thoknia and the Kyparissia mines were later mined. Years later, the mine had reached the settlement boundary taking away farmlands and extended southward where it is currently near the forest and is expected to be at the line of the Tripotamo-Anthochori Road. It will not affect the settlement of Tripotamo. By the time it reaches near Tripotamo, the power plant may be scheduled to close. The closure means the population growth will end.

Bristow Helicopters was established by Alan Bristow in June 1955; two years later, it acquired its first pair of helicopters in the form of the Westland Widgeon. The company quickly expanded overseas as well as various services, including helicopter training, oil exploration, search and rescue, and charter flights. Having entered the African market in 1960, Nigeria became Bristow's biggest profit center during the 1970s. Having entered the North Sea market during the 1960s, Bristow became Aberdeen Airport's largest single employer during the 1980s and was operating the majority of offshore flights in the North Sea. The company went through repeated changes in ownership during the 1980s and 1990s, leading to its acquisition by American helicopter operator Offshore Logistics in 1996, which re-branded itself as The Bristow Group in February 2006. Bristow Helicopters Limited holds a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence, it is permitted to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 seats or more.\\"Operating Licence Holders.\\" Civil Aviation Authority, Retrieved: 9 February 2020. The U.S. division of Bristow is a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved Part 135 air carrier. On 11 May 2019, Bristow Group entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, affecting North America operations, but leaving overseas operations unchanged. After an aggressive expansion earlier in the decade, demand was cut back as crude oil prices dropped and Bristow Group‚Äôs total debt stood at $1.44 billion by 30 September 2018. Bristow completed the UK's Eastern Airways sale on 10 May, and still wants to sell its interest in Australia's Airnorth, hoping for $230 million combined. History Bristow Helicopters Limited traces its origins back to the endeavours of British inventor and business man Alan Bristow. A former test pilot for both the Royal Navy and Westland Helicopters, Bristow had chosen to invest his earnings into forming multiple companies, the first of which being Air Whaling Ltd. In June 1995, he opted to establish Bristow Helicopters Limited after securing a contract for the supply of helicopter crews at the Shell Oil Company to support rigs in the Persian Gulf. During 1957, Bristow Helicopters received a contract from British Petroleum, which allowed the firm to purchase its own helicopters, a pair of Westland Widgeons. That same year, having realised that few companies could afford helicopter services, Bristow began to seek work around the globe; the company soon launched successful ventures into both Iran and Bolivia. In 1960, Bristow Helicopters chose to enter the African market via the acquisition of crop- spraying specialist Fison-Airwork, which had also operated in locations in Central America and the UK. Bristow opted to discontinue crop-spraying activities in favour of focusing on oil exploration work in Nigeria on behalf of Shell; by the start of the Biafran War in 1967, the company had a fleet of 11 helicopters committed the Nigerian oil exploration effort, based at Port Harcourt. Early on in the conflict, Bristow helped to evacuate oil workers in the region to the safety of Fernando Po; despite the risks, Bristow maintained its Nigerian operations throughout the three years of war via a reduced presence in Lagos and Warri. This decision to remain gave the company a head- start on rivals as oil companies returned to the region after the war's end. Throughout much of 1970s, Nigeria functioned as Bristow's biggest profit center; it continued to grow through the decade via contracts from Shell, Mobil, Texaco and other companies. In the mid-1960s, Bristow opted to enter the North Sea market; being the second helicopter operator (after BEA Helicopters Limited) to establish operations at Aberdeen, Scotland, it was relatively well positioned to take advantage of the region's oil boom. Starting on 17 February 1965, the company operated the Westland Wessex 60 ten- seat helicopter to support these off-shore installations. Throughout the 1970s, Bristow would expand its Aberdeen operation, its main oil and gas support hub being based at Dyce Airport; in 1972, the company allocated the first of several Sikorsky S-61N to Sumburgh Airport in support of Shell's offshore rigs. Following an expansion programme, which included the building of new on-site accommodations for workers and their families, around thirty S-61N flights were routinely flying daily from Sumburgh, supported by round- the-clock maintenance coverage, at the peak of operations during the 1970s. During the 1980s, Bristow became Aberdeen Airport's largest single employer, its personnel in Aberdeen having increased a hundred-fold, as well as operating the majority of offshore flights in the North Sea. In 1980 alone, nearly 400,000 passengers and over 2,300 tons of freight passed through Bristow's Aberdeen terminal. Hiller UH-12C used by Bristow to train Army Air Corps pilots Another key source of business was the provision of training services; in 1961, Bristow Helicopters commenced training of helicopter pilots on behalf of the Royal Navy at Redhill Aerodrome, Surrey; further training contracts were quickly secured from other helicopter operators in India, Australia and New Zealand. By 1970, Bristow had also established a training joint venture in Iran, although this was discontinued after the Iranian Revolution of 1979. During the late 1960s, Bristow Helicopters operated a fleet of Hiller UH-12 training helicopters based at AAC Middle Wallop which were used to train flight crews on behalf of the UK Army Air Corps. In 1986, the company began training overseas pilots at its flying school at Redhill Aerodrome; this program ran for multiple decades, being rebranded as the Bristow Academy. In addition to pilot training, Bristow has also been involved in training ground crew, having started sponsoring students at the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology, (NCAT), Zaria, in 1986. Starting in 1971, Bristow Helicopters began providing civilian search and rescue (SAR) services in the UK, replacing military Westland Whirlwinds with Bristow-operated Sikorsky S-55s at RAF Manston, Kent. The then-unfamiliar concept of using a private company for SAR services led to a public outcry and intense lobbying efforts thus, after three years, operations were turned back over to RAF Coastal Command. Bristow reentered the UK's SAR sector in 1983 when it commenced operations on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) from Sumburgh Airport; the company held the contract until 2007 and secured it again in June 2013. Other locations, including Stornoway, Lee-on-Solent, and Portland, would also be operated by Bristow on behalf of MCA. Over the years, Bristow's SAR units have responded to multiple incidents, including rescue efforts in the recovery of survivors of the Piper Alpha disaster. During the early 1970s, the backbone of Bristow's fleet consisted of the Westland Wessex, Westland Whirlwind, and Bell 206, along with a handful of other types, including several fixed-wing Britten-Norman BN-2 Islanders. By the 1980s, Bristow had entirely phased out the Wessexes; the bulk of its fleet came to consist of Bell 206s, Bell 212s, and Sikorsky S-76s, amongst other types, during this period. Bristow was in fact the first European operator to adopt the Sikorsky S-76 into commercial service. The company also played a leading role in the development of the A√©rospatiale Super Puma, having consulted with Aerospatiale to shape its design for the oil and gas market. Bristow decided to place a larger order for 35 Super Pumas, this being the largest civil helicopter order to have been made at the time; the first examples of the type were introduced in early 1982. Westland Wessex 60 helicopter in 1970 Within the company's first three decades, Bristow Helicopters had expanded into the provision of various helicopter-based services, including the provision of pilot training, search and rescue coverage, cargo transportation, and charter flights, in addition to its more traditional helicopter transport services. The business had also developed a worldwide presence within a similar timeframe, providing its services in the North Sea, Middle East, South America, Africa, Asia, India, Bermuda, Trinidad, Australia and New Zealand. The company went through repeated changes in ownership during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1985, Bristow Helicopters was acquired by British and Commonwealth Holdings plc.\\"British & Commonwealth acquires remaining interest in Bristow Helicopter Group.\\" alacrastore.com. That same year, Alan Bristow stood down from his active role in managing the company. It was soon sold on as a component of the Bricom Group via a management buy-out in 1988. In July 1990, Bricom was acquired by Scandinavian investment company Rochfield. In 1991, Bristow Helicopters was subject to another management buy-out headed by managing director and chief executive Bryan Collins. In 1996, Bristow Helicopters was purchased by Offshore Logistics, an American offshore helicopter operator which previously operated as Air Logistics in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, and was structured as a reverse takeover. The group operates and maintains a global fleet of over 400 aircraft. In February 2006, Offshore Logistics decided to re-brand itself as The Bristow Group. In January 2010, Bristow announced the retirement of the Air Logistics name and Gulf of Mexico operations would operate under the name Bristow. The Bristow Group expanded their portfolio in April 2007 with the purchase of Helicopter Adventures, a Florida-based flight school, Helicopter Adventures was subsequently renamed Bristow Academy.http://www.bristowgroup.com/pdf/Bristow_Corporate_Newsletter_May_2007.pdfSmith, Dale. \\"Training Profile: Bristow Academy\\" page 27-31.

G-JSAR was a Search and Rescue helicopter. Bristow helicopters operated Sikorsky S-61N helicopters on behalf of Her Majesty's Coastguard, the United Kingdom's Coast Guard, until July 2007 after which there was a 12-month transitional period whilst CHC Helicopter took over the contract replacing the S-61N with new helicopters. Bristow operated four dedicated Search and Rescue (SAR) sites in the UK, on behalf of HM Coastguard. The units were located at Portland (EGDP) and Lee-on-Solent (EGHF) on the south coast of England, at Stornoway (EGPO) in the Outer Hebrides, and at Sumburgh (EGPB) in the Shetland Isles. Northern North Sea services operated from Aberdeen (EGPD), Scatsta (EGPM) and Stavanger (ENZV). Southern North Sea services operate from Norwich (EGSH), Humberside (EGNJ) and Den Helder (EHKD) with its support organisation based at Redhill (EGKR). Bristow S61N's were responsible to carry out SAR tasks, operating from Den Helder Airport on behalf of the oil and gas industry. On 26 March 2013, Bristow was awarded a 10-year contract to operate the search and rescue operations in the United Kingdom, at the time being provided by CHC Helicopter (on behalf of Her Majesty's Coastguard), the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy. Bristow is currently operating AgustaWestland AW189 and Sikorsky S-92 helicopters in support of this contract.

During the approach to Aberdeen from the North Hutton platform, a loud bang was heard, followed by severe vibration. A PAN call was made to ATC by the crew. Shortly before landing control was lost and the helicopter struck the runway heavily on its side. 10 of 16 passengers received serious injuries. A tail boom panel had become detached in flight and damaged all five tail rotor blades. The resulting imbalance to the tail rotor assembly led to the separation of this unit and subsequent loss of control. * In 1984, G-BJJR, a Bell 212, crashed with the loss of two crew on approach to the Cecil Provine. * On 5 December 1991, VR-BIG, an Aerospatiale SA-330J Puma, ditched in Mermaid Sound, Dampier, Western Australia, after a pick-up from departing LNG tanker in night VFR conditions, entered a vortex ring state.

It covers and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The site was previously owned by financier Charles M. Pond of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad and Hartford National Bank, and a treasurer of Connecticut (1870‚Äì71). In 1894 he bequeathed his estate to the City of Hartford with the stipulation that it be named for his deceased wife, Elizabeth. The city took possession in 1897 and engaged the famed Olmsted and Son for landscaping. In 1904 the park's first superintendent, Theodore Wirth, created its renowned Rose Garden (). It is the oldest municipal rose garden in the United States, currently containing about 15,000 bushes of 800 rose varieties. In the 1970s the city declared it could no longer afford the garden, and initially proposed plowing it under, until volunteers banded together and came to the rescue. In 1977 volunteers banded together with Vic Jarm (Park Superintendent at the time) to form the Friends of Elizabeth Park and save the Rose Garden. Their first mission was to raise $10,000 to replace many of the rose bushes that died from lack of care. Since then the Friends of Elizabeth Park have assisted the City of Hartford in maintaining the Rose Garden as well as the other horticultural gardens in the park and have raised funds for the restoration of the historic greenhouses and the Elizabeth Pond Memorial in 1997, also known as the Pond House Cafe. Most of the financial support for the park through the efforts of the FEP comes from individuals, the Ethel Donaghue Trust and the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving. Today the park encompasses many garden areas, pathways, century-old Lord and Burnham greenhouses, lawns, bowling greens, tennis courts, a picnic grove, and a scenic pond. The border between Hartford and West Hartford has moved since the park was established, with the odd result that one of Hartford's largest parks is now located primarily within the Town of West Hartford.

Late Autumn follows the attempts of three older men to help the widow of a late friend to marry off her daughter. The daughter is less than happy at the proposals, mainly because of her reluctance to leave her mother alone. The film was selected as the Japanese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 33rd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences While not one of the works for which Ozu is most known, Late Autumn is highly regarded by critics. Plot Three middle-aged friends and former college mates ‚Äì Mamiya (Shin Saburi), Taguchi (Nobuo Nakamura) and Hirayama (Ry≈´ji Kita) ‚Äì meet up for the 7th memorial service of a late college friend, Miwa. Miwa's widow Akiko (Setsuko Hara) and 24-year-old daughter Ayako (Yoko Tsukasa) are also present. The three friends remark amongst themselves how good Akiko looks despite being in her forties. The party chats and thinks that it is time for Ayako to get married. Taguchi tells them he has a prospective suitor for Ayako, but it later turns out the man already has a fianc√©e. Mamiya instead offers his employee, Goto (Keiji Sada), as another match, but Ayako confides privately in Akiko that she has no wish of getting married. Ayako, who lives alone with Akiko, is close to her mother, who teaches dressmaking. Ayako meets Goto one day at Mamiya's office. During a hiking trip, a colleague offers to introduce him to Ayako again. Ayako and Goto begin dating, but Ayako is unwilling to get married because that will mean Akiko will live all alone. Ayako puts forward to Mamiya her theory that \\"romance and marriage could be separate\\". The three friends think that all this is an excuse and begin to speculate that Ayako will marry if Akiko remarries. The other two offer Hirayama, a widower, as Akiko's prospective remarriage partner. Hirayama warns them not to go ahead with their plan, but after discussing with his son to remarry, changes his mind. Hirayama now approaches Taguchi and Mamiya for help. Before they can break the subject to Akiko, however, Mamiya tactlessly lets Ayako know about their plan. Thinking that her mother has known about this, an unhappy Ayako goes home to question her and then leaves for her colleague and friend Yuriko's (Mariko Okada) place in a huff. Yuriko, however, approves of Akiko's remarriage. She tells Ayako not to be selfish, which gains Ayako's displeasure. Displeased, Yuriko confronts the three friends, and finds out the truth from them. Mamiya apologizes for their mishap; however, seeing their cause, Yuriko decides to help Hirayama. When Akiko and Ayako go for their last trip together, Akiko tells her daughter she has decided not to marry. She urges Ayako not to worry about her. With her assurance, Ayako marries Goto, leaving her mother to live alone.

History  After the New York State Park Commission was first created in 1902, New York State Police had responsibility for patrolling parks and parkways. In 1946, Long Island State Park Commission President Robert Moses created the Long Island State Park Police Department to patrol Long Island‚Äôs parks. Throughout its existence, the force was strongly identified with Moses, the so-called \\"master builder,\\" and provided his chauffeurs and bodyguards. In 1950, the name of the agency was changed to the Long Island State Parkway Police to reflect its added responsibility of patrolling the parkways in addition to the parks. = Dissolution = In 1980, with Moses's power broken, the New York State legislature passed legislation giving the New York State Police responsibility for the state parkways, while the New York State Park Police maintained responsibility for the parks.

He was the right halfback of the Uruguayan national team that won the 1950 World Cup tournament, after defeating Brazil in the decisive match. He was the nephew of another Uruguayan international player, Jos√© Leandro Andrade, who was also a World Cup winner, having played for the Uruguay squad that won the first ever edition in 1930. Rodr√≠guez Andrade also played at the 1954 World Cup and won the 1956 South American Championship with Uruguay, and at the club level, he won two Uruguayan First Division titles with C.A. Pe√±arol. He is regarded as one of the finest midfielders ever. Early life and career Born in the Barrio Sur of Montevideo, V√≠ctor Rodr√≠guez came to the world into a family that proudly revered the name of his uncle, Jos√© Leandro Andrade. His admiration for his uncle and the naming customs made him use both last names; he drew comparisons with \\"The Black Marvel\\", not only because he was his relative, but also because they both played on the wing (although Andrade played in the right flank). Thus, the name Rodr√≠guez Andrade would universally remain used when referring to the left midfielder, and sometimes he is even referred to simply as Andrade. Growing up, Rodr√≠guez played on the streets of Barrio Sur and Barrio Palermo. He began his footballing career at Central F√∫tbol Club, from the latter neighbourhood, and during his time at that club, he earned his first call up to the national team, in 1947. Remembered as one of the emblematic figures of the club in its first 100 years, he remained at Central until 1952, the year he joined Pe√±arol, with whom he won the Uruguayan Championship in 1953 and 1954. Uruguay national team Rodr√≠guez Andrade wore the Uruguayan jersey from December 1947 to May 1957. He participated at the World Cup finals of 1950 and 1954, as well as the South American Championships of 1947 (his first official international tournament), 1953, and 1956. He earned a total of 42 caps for La Celeste with 3 goals.Source: RSSSF (http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/uru-recintlp.html). =1950 World Cup and the Maracanazo= At the 1950 World Cup in Brazil, Rodr√≠guez Andrade, who at 23 years old was one of the younger members of the Uruguayan squad, played in all four of his team's matches. In the final round match against the hosts, which would decide the winner of the tournament, his defensive duties included the marking of Zizinho, a task he was successful at until the beginning of the second half, when the Brazilian assisted Fria√ßa, who scored the 1‚Äì0. However, as he later narrated himself, Rodr√≠guez Andrade saw the lineman lift his flag during the play, indicating offside against Brazil. In the second the Uruguayan lost when he looked at the judge, Fria√ßa left him behind, to face the goalkeeper one-on-one. When he was confronted by Obdulio Varela, Rodr√≠guez told him: \\"Fue offside, Jacinto\\", and then, in a key moment of the game, the captain, with the ball under his arm, protested to the referee for several moments; the goal stood, but Varela had cooled down the situation for Uruguay, and silenced the crowd. Uruguay regrouped, and then Juan Schiaffino scored the equalizer and Alcides Ghiggia the winner, to complete the famous upset known as the Maracanazo. =1954: End of World Cup glory= Four years later in Switzerland, the focal point of the spectacular World Cup finals was the Hungarian team. The \\"Golden Team\\" scored 17 goals in its two first round victories. Meanwhile, Uruguay played against Czechoslovakia and Scotland and won 2-0 and 7-0 respectively, to top their group. In the second round, they defeated England 4‚Äì2, and Hungary beat Brazil by the same score. The defending world champions and the favourites would clash in semi-finals, and in a match that is remembered as one of the most magnificent demonstrations of football by both teams, it took the Magyars 120 minutes to give Uruguay its first ever World Cup defeat. Rodr√≠guez Andrade, who just as he did in 1950, played in every match of the tournament, had a strong performance in his final World Cup appearance, even though he had to play the extra time with a pulled muscle. =South American Championship= Uruguay, which had won its last South American title in 1942 when Rodr√≠guez Andrade was in his teens, was unable to win it six straight times from 1945 to 1955, including the first two in which he appeared, 1953 and 1955. In the 1955 edition, they were humiliated in a 1‚Äì6 loss to Angel Labruna's Argentina. But in early 1956, Montevideo hosted the event, and veteran Andrade, who was the only remaining member of the 1950 World Cup final squad, led the Charr√∫as to win the title; they defeated Labruna and Omar Sivori's Argentina in the last match, which was, like six years earlier in Brazil, not a final, but just happened to be de deciding match. Rodr√≠guez Andrade thus became the only Uruguayan player of his generation to win the World Cup and the South American Championship.Uruguay defender William Mart√≠nez, who with Rodr√≠guez Andrade won the 1956 South American Championship, was also in the 1950 World Cup squad, but did not play in that tournament. After football His last international match was on June 5, 1957, a 1‚Äì1 draw against Argentina. After ending his football career, he resided in Montevideo for the rest of his life. He worked as an usher at Montevideo's Palace of Congress for about 20 years, and during that time he was involved in the founding of basketball team 25 de Agosto of the Uruguayan Basketball Federation. Rodr√≠guez Andrade died in May 1985, and a month after his death, Senator Luis Hierro Gambardella dedicated a speech to him during a session of the Congress.

Owned and operated by Iberdrola Renewables, it is the largest wind farm in Massachusetts, with 19 GE 1.5 MW wind turbines and a total installed capacity of 28.5 MW. The Hoosac Wind power project became fully operational in 2012, and provides enough electricity to power 10,000 homes annually. History In 1980, during a Bakke Mountain hike, the Bakke family noticed the region was quite breezy. The sparse tree growth was misshapen and deformed by the strong winds. Hans Bakke began to consider the possibility of wind energy at the site. EnXco, the wind- energy company and partner of the French energy conglomerate √âlectricit√© de France, approached the Bakke family to propose building a wind farm, together they created Hoosac Wind LLC. In November 2004, the State of Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection approved the proposed project. However, thorny issues plague the project including the presence of potentially vulnerable species of goldenrod in the vicinity of the proposed site, as well as the asserted danger to the migratory paths of birds and bats. Hoosac Wind achieved tentative approval from both Florida and Monroe after taking considerable amounts of wind-speed and direction data, along with avian, archeological, geological, and wildlife studies which were conducted as well. In January 2006, Hoosac Wind LLC was purchased by the British company PPM Energy for an estimated US$40 million, PPM was subsequently absorbed by Iberdrola Renewables.PPM Energy is Now Iberdrola Renewables (May 1, 2008) Reuters. Hoosac Wind LLC was renamed New England Wind LLC. Green Berkshires, an environmental organization opposed to wind energy projects in the Berkshire mountain range, had filed an appeal rejected by the State of Massachusetts Division of Administrative Law Appeals. As of May, 2008, the project was still under review post environmental standards challenges.Stafford, Scott. \\"Florida, Monroe wind turbine project slows\\" (May 5, 2008) Berkshire Eagle. The project began construction in early 2012 and was completed in December 2012. Project details The project consists of 19 GE Wind Energy 1.5 MW wind turbines and is divided among two separate sites ‚Äì nine turbines on Crum Hill in Monroe, and ten on Bakke Mountain in Florida, Massachusetts. Each turbine produces 1.5 MW, the site has a capacity to produce 28.5 MW; this is enough energy to supply approximately 10,00 average homes in the region annually. The towers are tall, with blades. From base to vertically positioned blade tip, they will be approximately . The turbines begin generating energy at wind speeds as low as , and produce the maximum power output when winds blow above . The maximum rotor speed is 20 rpm. The project was built with turbines manufactured at facilities all across the U.S. The power generated is delivered to the New England grid through the local utility National Grid. =Environmental impact= The Hoosac Wind Power Project offsets approximately 100 million pounds of carbon dioxide per year relative to conventional electricity generation. That is equivalent to the estimated annual emissions produced by 9,400 cars or consuming more than 112,000 barrels of oil. =Economic impact= Approximately US$257,000 in annual payments in lieu of taxes are made to the host towns (US$135,000 to Florida, $122,000 to Monroe), escalating with inflation, amounting to approximately US$6.8 million over the life of the agreement. In addition, the towns host turbines on town-owned land, which will generate approximately US$3 million in revenue over the life of the project. The project created 3 permanent jobs, 140 temporary construction jobs at peak, and purchase many products and services locally. To date, the project has generated 70,098 local labor hours and nearly US$3.8 million in local spending.

A prince and his friends rode by and broke the pot in a game. She cursed him to fall in love with an ogress's daughter. Within hours, he became lost in a wood and lost his attendants, and found a girl mocking snails. He fell in love at sight, and the girl, Filadoro, also fell in love with him. He was too tongue-tied to woo, and the ogress caught him. He tried to strike her, but could not move. She ordered him to dig an acre of land and sow it by evening. Filadoro comforted him. When he heard she had magic, he asked why they could not leave; she answered a conjunction of the stars prevented it, but would go. When the ogress returned in the evening, calling Filadoro to throw down her hair so that she could climb it, the land was ready. The next day, she set him to split seven stacks of wood, and Filadoro did it again. The third day, the ogress suspected Filadoro and set the prince to empty a cistern. Filadoro said that they must flee and dug a hole to an underground passage and they ran away. The prince did not want to bring her to his palace afoot and dressed this way, so he went to get suitable clothing and a carriage. The ogress cursed him to forget her as soon as he was kissed, and when he reached the castle, his mother kissed him. He could no longer explain what had happened to him, and agreed to marry as his mother wished. When Filadoro heard about the wedding, she disguised herself as a man and went to the castle where she was hired as a kitchen boy. When the pie which Filadoro had made is carved, out flies a dove who reminds the prince about everything Filadoro has done for him. Once the dove has flown away, the prince has the kitchen boy who made the pie brought before him. Filadoro falls before the prince's feet, he at once recognizes her and declares to his that she would be the one he would marry. His mother wants merely what the prince desires while the chosen bride admits to wanting to not be wed but return to Flanders. Whereupon, Filadoro and the prince are wed.

Biography  Buchanan was born to Patrick C. and Margaret Graham Buchanan in Rich Valley, Smyth County, Virginia. He received an A.B. in 1856 and an M.A. in 1858 or 1860, both from Emory and Henry College, where he was a member of the faculty until 1878 with the exception of the Civil War years when he served the Confederate States in the mining department. In 1879 he became the Latin chair at Vanderbilt University and later served as president of Emory and Henry College before being appointed VAMC president in 1880. The state legislature replaced the Board of Visitors, who in turn removed all university officials and faculty in June 1880. Buchanan re-assumed the presidency of VAMC in August 1881, but was removed for the second and final time in January 1882. At this time, Buchanan began teaching at Martha Washington College in Abingdon, Virginia, later becoming president there. In 1884 he served on a state committee that established the State Normal Female School in Farmville (now Longwood University). From 1885 to 1889 he served as state superintendent of public instruction (hence was ex officio member of the VAMC Board of Visitors). He began teaching at Randolph-Macon College in 1889, later becoming president. He resigned the presidency of Randolph-Macon in 1894 to assume presidency of what was then Arkansas Industrial University before he renamed it to University of Arkansas and where he remained until retiring in 1902. Buchanan died January 19, 1922, in Rich Valley, Virginia, at age 90.

Willis (born 26 October 1937Birthdate confirmation: zerozero.eu website.) is an English former association football referee, who operated in the Football League. He originates from Newfield, near Bishop Auckland, County Durham, but now lives in Meadowfield. His other occupation was as a police officer. Early life He was educated at Spennymoor Grammar School, and later played amateur football for Tow Law Town. He was signed by Newcastle United, but never played above reserve level for them, eventually giving up to join the police force. He served at Cassop and Quarrington Hill, also playing football for their local teams. Throughout his career, his wife Helen had been \\"hugely supportive\\".Main reference for much of the information: article at Darlington and Stockton Times website. Career Before one of those local matches in 1963, the appointed referee failed to turn up. Willis took charge of the game, and soon after formally trained as a referee. He became a Football League linesman in 1968. He was promoted to the supplementary list of referees in 1971 and then the full list in 1972. He was appointed to the Football League Cup Final of 1982, when Liverpool defeated Tottenham 3‚Äì1, after extra time.League Cup Final 1982: soccerbase.com website. Willis refereed the 1985 FA Cup Final between Manchester United and Everton, which United won 1‚Äì0, courtesy of a Norman Whiteside goal during extra time. This appointment made him one of very few non-FIFA referees to control both major English Cup Finals. In the 78th minute of normal time he sent off Kevin Moran of Manchester United1985 FA Cup Final, Moran (Man. United) sent off, 78th minute, v. Everton: manutdzone.com website. after a foul on Everton's Peter Reid away from goal. In a 2002 newspaper article, Willis commented: \\"Moran just kicked him. Peter Reid might well have gone higher up in the air than he needed to but I saw what happened and I had a decision to make. I either put the whistle on the ground and walked off, or applied the laws of the game and sent him off.\\" Moran put his side of it in a 2006 interview: \\"... I didn't think it was a foul; I had no intention of pulling Peter Reid down and felt I never touched him. I went into the tackle from the side and his momentum flicked him over, as if I'd clattered him. I couldn't believe it when I got a straight red.\\"Kevin Moran's comments on the FA Cup Final dismissal: interview at the Guardian Unlimited website. Moran therefore became the first player ever to be dismissed from the field of play in an FA Cup Final.Confirming that Moran was the first ever to be sent off in an FA Cup Final: TheFA.com website. Willis said: \\"It's never caused me a problem. I've never felt guilty about it, because it was the right decision. I just wish it hadn't happened because I'd rather be remembered for other reasons.\\" (The Red Card was not shown, because Red & Yellow Cards were not shown in English Football League matches between January 1981 and August 1987.) Following this match he had one final season on the league list (1985‚Äì1986). His last match was at Goodison Park where Everton needed to beat Southampton to have any chance of retaining the league title. They did indeed win (6‚Äì1) but Liverpool won at Chelsea to claim the honour. He is said to be one of only five freemasons to have been in charge of an FA Cup Final.Freemason reference: MQ Magazine website. He was president of the Referees' Association from 1984 to 2002. He suffered a stroke in 2000, which was a factor in his deciding to stand down from the presidency.

He is a highly influential 'musical sound designer' in Hollywood having worked on many blockbuster films, yet his sound is often hard to describe or even identify. He is probably best known for his collaboration work with Hans Zimmer and has contributed with both ambient music design and music to some of last decades biggest Hollywood blockbusters. He has also made numerous production music CDs for Extreme Music which loosely feature some of the atmospheric textures in his world of ambient music design. On the Inception premiere in Hollywood, Wesson and Zimmer designed an outdoor sound installation using the atmosphere and soundscapes from the movie itself, exclusively for the audience. In Wesson's own words: \\"Hans wanted the audience to remain within the Inception dreamscape as they left the LA Inception Premiere. In order to achieve this I put together a 40-minute soundscape designed to surround the audience as they followed the mirrored walkway from the Gaumans Chinese Theatre in Hollywood to the nearby after-show reception. The soundscape ambience from the movie, together with a few well chosen FX from Inception sound designer Richard King.\\" Early life and career Wesson was born and raised in London, England. Despite numerous efforts to persuade him to follow a more conventional musical path he gravitated towards the synthesizer as his instrument of choice. After leaving art college the formative stages of Wesson's career saw him touring and recording with a number of new wave bands. Wesson also began working out of Hans Zimmers' Lillie Yard Studio where he began to explore the studio and experiment with sound and picture as well working with such artists as Siouxsie and The Banshees, producer Mike Hedges and musician Youth. He received a multi platinum award for his contributions to The Verve's Urban Hymns album and their single \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\\". It was this album Zimmer was listening to in 2000 when he spotted Wesson's credit and invited him to work on the score for Mission: Impossible 2. Since that time Wesson has created his own niche within the movie score genre as an ambient music designer. This area of atmospheric sound has weaved its way through many of Zimmer's' scores including Ridley Scott's Hannibal and Black Hawk Down. Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and most recently Inception. Outside of his feature film work, Wesson composes scores for commercials, television and video games; some of his television scores include work for the BBC, ITV, Discovery, MTV, CNN News broadcasts, Sky.

Banquet photography is the photography of large groups of people, typically in a banquet setting such as a hotel or club banquet room, with the objective of commemorating an event. Clubs, associations, unions, circuses and debutante balls have all been captured by banquet photographers. A banquet photograph is usually taken in black and white with a large format camera, with a wide angle lens, from a high angle to ensure that each person is in focus while seated at their table. Large cameras such as a 12√ó20 view camera or a panoramic camera were used. The defining characteristic of a banquet photograph is the depth of focus and detail and clarity of the image. Banquet photography was most popular in the 1890s, and had mostly waned by the 1970s. In part its decline is owed to the difficult technical aspects of producing quality banquet photos, the difficulty of printing such large negatives, and the expense and size of the equipment needed. Today, though hard to find, there are a handful of photographers still shooting banquet photos with flashbulbs and large format film cameras.  History  Lighting for a banquet photograph was originally done with flash powder. Magnesium is the metallic element that fuels flash powder and it was 1864 when Alfred Brothers made the first portrait with magnesium light. The first flashbulbs were developed by the Hauser Company in Germany in 1930 and within a decade flashbulbs began replacing flash powder as a light source. It was in 1939 that William Randolph Hearst hosted a meeting of his editors when the photographer taking the large group photograph was badly burned by an explosion of flash powder. Hearst decreed that from that point on all of his photographers were required to use flashbulbs only. Some noted banquet photographers were Edward J Kelty (1888-1967) who was an early banquet camera user who photographed circuses predominantly with traditional banquet cameras. Eugene Omar Goldbeck (1892‚Äì1986) known as the \\"unofficial photographer of America's military,\\" used Cirkut cameras which worked outside and rotated, whereas the traditional banquet camera with flashbulbs worked just as well inside. Miles Weaver (1879‚Äì1932) ran one of the largest banquet and panoramic photography studios in Los Angeles. His work included early Academy Award celebrations, religious revivals, movie publicity stills and bathing beauty pageants. George R. Lawrence (1869‚Äì1938) was renowned for developing a flash powder that permitted indoor banquet photography. His system required flash powder in many locations around a room, sometimes in as many as 350 spots. A single electric charge exploded all the powder, generating more light and less smoke than previous methods. In New York city from 1923 to 1995 The Standard Flash Company and later known as Standard Studios with principal photographers Kenneth Brooks (1926-1995) and Jayson Jons (1922-2012) (born John Selepec) photographed thousands of banquet photos. In Chicago Thomas Yanul (1940‚Äì2014) did banquet photos for both corporate and social events. Picture making process =Camera setup= Hours before an indoor banquet photograph is to be taken the banquet photographer sets up their large format, commonly 12‚Äùx20‚Äù banquet camera, in a corner of the room on a tall tripod or from the balcony and stands on a ladder to reach the camera. With a wide-angle lens set to the widest aperture and the shutter open, the photographer frames the picture on the ground glass with the aid of a light shielding dark cloth over their head. It is important to remember that the view of the scene on the ground glass is both upside and backwards. Left is right and right is left. =Framing= With the help of an assistant holding a lit candle or lantern the assistant walks to the bottom of the frame in close proximity to the camera where the closest people will be, the photographer looks at the top of the ground glass to adjust where the seated person will be cropped. The assistant goes to the left side of the room the photographer views the right side of the ground glass to see if the people at the table will be visible. This continues until left right and top and bottom of the composition are framed up while the banquet photographer makes framing adjustments in order to determine if all people seated at tables are going to be in the picture. =Focus= Using the view camera‚Äôs rise and fall, tilt and shift the photographer meticulously focuses the camera on the candle as the assistant moves from front to middle and to back of the frame. Once the camera is focused the photographer tightens everything into a locked position. The shutter is cocked. The lens is closed down to a small aperture. The dry plate holder or film holder is mounted over the ground glass. Lighting for flat (non-rotating cameras): Flash powder in troughs or flashbulbs with silver reflectors are strung in a series from the balcony or floor to the left and to the right of the camera around the perimeter of the room and out-of-the camera‚Äôs view. =Enter the guests= Anybody sitting at a table that can not be seen by the fixed lens of the camera is asked to move to the rear of the room to stand behind the last row of tables. As soon as everyone is in their seats, and the people who would have been missed have moved into frame several last steps are critical to taking the photograph. The photographer pulls out the dark slide from the film holder to allow light to strike the emulsion of the film. It is handed to an assistant. The photographer silences the group. Subjects are directed to turn and face towards and look up at the camera. The photographer cues the participants that they will count down and say ‚Äúopen‚Äù and that they need to be absolutely motionless during the explosion of the flash for two seconds. With the air-driven, lemon-sized rubber bulb release which opens the Packard shutter in one hand, and a switch which ignites the flash lighting and exposes the film in the other, the photographer gives their cue, opens the shutter, ignites the flash waits until the light diminishes and releases the bulb which closes the shutter. The assistant hands the dark slide to the photographer who slides it back into the film holder so the exposed film is protected and the film holder is taken from the back of the camera and placed into a light safe bag. =Processing and proof prints= While the banquet team disassembles the lights and camera, the film is taken into a darkroom and developed.

It is a tributary of Pasig River with headwaters located in the Sierra Madre Mountains in Rodriguez, Rizal province. Marikina River used to be an important transport route during the Spanish colonial era, but its importance as a transport route diminished when the Philippines' national highway system became more established. The resulting lack of river boat traffic and the deforestation of the upland areas in what is now the Upper Marikina River Basin Protected Landscape contributed to the river's siltation, further reducing its value as a transport route. Due to negligence and industrial development, the river has become very polluted, an act which recent Marikina City administrations have attempted to address. The Marikina River system Marikina River Park Upper Marikina River in Rodriguez, Rizal In the Pamitinan Protected Landscape located in Sitio Wawa, Brgy. San Rafael in Rodriguez, the Marikina River is dammed by Wawa Dam, a structure built during the early 1900s to provide water for Manila.\\"Final List of Watersheds Supporting 140 River Irrigation System of the NIA\\", pg. 5. Green Army Network. Retrieved on 2012-08-15. From Rodriguez, the river flows through San Mateo then to its namesake city of Marikina. In Pasig City, the river meets the gates of the Manggahan Floodway, a controlled waterway used to prevent flooding in Manila during heavy rains by diverting most of the water of the Marikina towards Laguna de bay instead of Pasig River. Located downstream is the confluence of Marikina and Pasig Rivers.\\"Manggahan Floodway\\". Google Maps. Retrieved on 2012-08-15. The river's depth ranges from and spans from . It has a total area of nearly and is long. The riverbank has an elevation of 8 meters above sea level at the boundary of San Mateo and Marikina. This slowly goes down at an elevation of nearly before the Malanday and Santo Ni√±o boundary. The lowest elevation is along Calumpang which above sea level. =Tributary Waterways= The Marikina River has a number of tributaries in the form of creeks and rivers, and at least one former river-section in Marikina's Barangay Tumana from which the original flow of the river has been diverted. These tributaries drain four municipalities and one city in the Province of Rizal, and three cities in the Philippines' National Capital Region. Rodriguez, Rizal The biggest of these tributaries are upstream in the more mountainous areas of Rodriguez. This includes the Tayabasan River and Montalban River, the Boso Boso River, and the Wawa River, which meets the Marikina River just upstream of Wawa Dam. Further downstream from the dam, but still in the town of Rodriguez are the Puray river (which flows near Avilon Zoo), and the Manga river. Barangka Up till this point the river follows a more or less East-West direction until San Jose, Rodriguez, where it takes a sharp North-South turn towards the municipality of San Mateo, where the Ampid River forms the boundary between Barangays Maly and Ampid. At this point across the River in Quezon City, Calamiong Creek drains Barangay Bagong Silang. Further downstream the Nangka River and its own tributary in the Sapang Labo Creek mark the Boundary between San Mateo and Marikina. City of Marikina Somewhere north of Brgy. Tumana in Marikina marks a point at which an American Colonial Era levee shifted the flow of Marikina River west, away from the population center of Sitio Bayanbayanan (now known as Concepcion Uno), where erosion had been a problem. The construction of a levee left behind a remnant waterway now known as Patay na Ilog (literally \\"Dead River\\", referring to the former path of the river) where the original path of the river once traversed, which rejoins the Marikina River just south of Tumana Bridge. The dredging for this American era levee left behind a large stone outcropping just below water level where the Marikina's children would play, back when the water was still clean, such that this part of the river is still called \\"luksong kabayo\\". The name of Barangay Tumana refers to the Tagalog word for a wide level land just above water level. The area was considered ideal for vegetable farming due to the rich riversoil, and the annual inundation of the area by the Marikina River during rainy season, which prevented crawling insect pests from staying permanently. This area was eventually also used for riversoil quarrying and saw an influx of informal settlers which turned it into a residential area, eventually becoming a separate barangay from Concepcion, with Patay na Ilog forming part of the boundary. Further south on the Quezon City side Barangay Pansol is drained by Pansol Creek, with headwaters reaching as far up to just behind the University of the Philippines Integrated School Campus. Even Further South in Barangay Malanday, Marikina, the Lamuan-Bulelak creek also empties into the Marikina River, although its precise mouth area has been blurred by the construction of residential buildings. =Marikina River landmarks in Marikina City= Adjacent Creeks In Marikina city, numerous other creeks flow nearby the Marikina river but are not directly connected. These include the Bankaan Creek in Barangay Parang, the Concepcion Creek in Barangay Concepcion Dos, and the Usiw Creek in Barangay Santa Elena. Instead, these waterways are linked in a complex network with the Balanti, Halang, and Muntingdilao Creeks and the Sapang Baho River, eventually emptying into Manggahan Floodway and Laguna de Bay. Ecology Marikina River is on the verge of an ecological imbalance as a strange species of fish has dominated its ecosystem. Since the late 1990s, the Marikina River has been infested by janitor fish. Before, the river was thriving with local species martiniko, ayungin and biya. The growing fish population has prompted the city government to launch a new program to control their number. The city issued Ordinance 004, series of 2007, launching Janitor Fish Eradication Drive in the City of Marikina, granting cash incentives to participants, appropriating annually fifty thousand Pesos ( for the purpose. A scientific study of the species found in five locations in the Laguna de Bay tributary system, including the Marikina River, revealed that the specimen of janitor fish previously reported as Hypostomus plecostomus actually belong to the genus Pterygoplichthys, family Loricariidae. The collected specimens for this study consisted of two species; Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus and Pterygoplichthys pardalis. Both species were collected from the Marikina River. Only the species disjunctivus was collected from Pasig River.American Chronicle  Janitor Fish Threatens Asia's Largest Marshland Crossings A total of 16 bridges cross the Marikina. The first bridge from the tri-junction with Boso- Boso and Sapa Bute Rivers is the Pacific Bridge, followed by the Rancho Luisito Way Bridge, Eastwood Greenview Bridge, and Phil Rock Spillway Bridge respectively to the south. Then it goes further towards the first government- owned bridge which is the San Jose Bridge. Crossing over to the border in between Quezon City and San Mateo, Batasan-San Mateo Bridge crosses the route and then in Marikina it goes towards four bridges namely Gil Fernando Bridge, Marikina Bridge, Marcos Bridge, and the Line 2 bridge from Santolan Station to Katipunan Station. The next bridge downstream towards the border between Quezon City and Marikina is the Macapagal Bridge connecting the cities of Quezon and Marikina. Then it crosses over to another administrative border between Quezon City and Pasig City with the Manalo Bridge. Further downstream, the remaining bridges prior to the river's southern end are all in Pasig City wherein the first two are the Rosario Bridge and Sandoval Bridge. Then the newest bridge, opened in October 2017, is the Kaginhawaan Bridge that connects barangays Poblacion and Ugong in Pasig. Then the last bridges near the Pasig River confluence are the Vargas Bridge and the Santa Rosa de Lima Bridge. The future expressway bridge is the Metro Manila Skyway. Skyway stage 4 or Metro Manila Expressway/C-6 as planned serves as a connection road from the Stage 3 in Santa Mesa, Manila to the Batasang Pambansa Complex in Quezon City. The expressway bridge will be built within the city of Marikina, and will serve as a solution to heavy traffic along the Magsaysay Boulevard-Aurora Boulevard- Marikina-Infanta Highway corridor as well as Ortigas Avenue. The project is expected to commence by 2018. Significant floods =Typhoon Ketsana/Ondoy= On 26 September 2009 at about 6:00 pm PST, Typhoon Ondoy hit Metro Manila and dumped one month's rainfall in less than 24 hours, causing the Marikina River system, including the Manggahan Floodway, to burst its banks rapidly. Along with flooding along other river systems, 80 percent of the National Capital Region became flooded. Also flooded were 25 nearby provinces. In Metro Manila alone, of dirty water forced people to evacuate their homes. By the 30th of September at least 450,000 inhabitants had been displaced, with at last 380,000 forced into makeshift shelters; 246 people were reported dead. It is believed that blocked pipes, a poorly maintained sewerage system, and uncollected domestic waste were major factors in the speed with which the flood waters engulfed the surrounding area. This prompted President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to declare a State of National Calamity and set up a task force to rescue the inhabitants. However, the government was forced to admit that resources were in short supply and called for global assistance. Thereafter, efforts have been made to make the drainage system better for the whole city by fixing the sewers together with the new trademarked \\"Red Sidewalks\\". This is the worst storm that Metro Manila has experienced since 1967. =Typhoon Meari/Falcon= On 24 June 2011, heavy rains of Severe Tropical Storm Meari affected Luzon including Metro Manila. The water level in Marikina River reached its critical level, flooding beside its riverbanks, just near along the river. However, the water level did not reach its higher banks, into the streets and communities. No casualties were reported but the mud and debris from the river was left by overflowed riverbanks. =Typhoon Nesat/Pedring= On 27 September 2011, Typhoon Pedring dumped heavy rains like Ondoy over Luzon including Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Marikina's water level reached a higher level than 24 June 2011, reaching by 5 pm. The flood submerged houses in several barangays of Marikina City and San Mateo. SM Marikina Basement Parking submerged in muddy water. No deaths were recorded in Marikina, but in San Mateo, there is one. The day after, the Marikina River returned in critical level. On 29 September 2011, 5 am, water subsided in the banks of the river and the residents started to clean. At 6 am, water reached . =2012 Southwest Monsoon rains/Habagat= Although located hundreds of kilometres away from the Philippines, the southerly flow from Typhoon Haikui in early August, 2012 enhanced the southwest monsoon across much of Luzon. As a result, widespread heavy rains impacted regions still recovering from deadly floods triggered by Typhoon Saola less than a week earlier. During a 22‚Äëhour span from 6‚Äì7 August, of rain fell in parts of Metro Manila, leading local media to compare the event to Typhoon Ketsana in 2009, which killed 464 in the city. Some of the most severe flooding took place along the Marikina River, which swelled to near-record levels. During the afternoon of 7 August, the river reached a height of , well beyond the flood level of and about below the record level set during Typhoon Ketsana. About 70 percent of Metro Manila was affected by flooding. Some areas were submerged in up to . Due to the expanding floods, officials in the city evacuated more than 23,000 residents from flood-prone areas and relocated them to shelters set up across the area. According to a reporter from the British Broadcasting Corporation, many residents were reluctant to leave their belongings behind, and some traveled back through flood waters to retrieve their belongings. Officials feared the flooding could worsen as the La Mesa Dam continued to overflow at the time. At least nine people were killed and four others were injured in a landslide in Quezon City. More than fifty people died on this day. This was the worst rain in non-direct typhoon or tropical storm on record that Metro Manila has experienced since 2009, surpassing the accumulated amount of rain brought by Typhoon Ketsana.

Stevens was nicknamed \\"Rhino\\" by his teammates, although it is unclear if this was due to his fearless tackling style or the size of his nose. He gained a regular first team place two seasons later and helped Millwall reach the Second Division in 1985 and the First Division (for the first time) in 1988. He helped them finish 10th in their first top division season, and even after their relegation the following year he was able to bolster their defence and ensure that they were at least a match for most other second-tier teams. In 1994, he was ever-present in the league as they finished third, but lost out on a place in the Premier League due to a playoff defeat at the hands of Derby County in the semi-finals. Millwall were relegated to Division Two in 1996, and although Stevens was no longer a regular first team player after this stage he continued as a player for another three seasons. Stevens was appointed player-manager of Millwall in May 1998 on the dismissal of Billy Bonds, and named teammate Alan McLeary as his co-manager. They remained in charge until their controversial dismissal on 17 September 2000 after failing to get Millwall promoted back to Division One,Millwall sack Stevens and McLeary a feat which was achieved eight months later under successor Mark McGhee, with the team that Stevens and McLeary had built.

Official website Oicat√°  Etymology  The name Oicat√° comes from Chibcha and means \\"Domain of the priests\\" or \\"Hailstoned farmlands\\". Etymology Oicat√° - Excelsio.net  History  The municipality was founded on May 9, 1539 by Pedro Ruiz Corredor. Before the Spanish conquest it was the territory of the Muisca, which was the most developed in the country socially, culturally, and in productivity. Post-conquest governmental power was exercised by the Governor General, who was directly appointed by the King of Spain. After several centuries of Spanish rule, and after fierce battles, the people won their freedom from Spain in the Battle of Boyac√°, where on August 7, 1819, troops under the command of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var defeated the Spanish forces. In 1821 the Constitution of C√∫cuta divided the country into departments, the departments into provinces, provinces into counties, and counties into parishes, establishing Boyac√° Department as an administrative entity comprising the provinces of Tunja, Pamplona, Socorro and Casanare. The Act of June 15, 1857, established Boyac√° as a sovereign state consisting of the provinces of Tunja, Tundama, Casanare, and the counties of Chiquinquir√° and Velez. The Act of October 31 of that year created four departments: Tunja with 42 districts, Tundama with 46, Casanare with 21, and Oriente (East) with 6. Under the Constitution of Rionegro in 1863 the administrative divisions of Boyac√° underwent various modifications, and Law 10 of that year established a new division into 6 departments: Casanare, Tundama, North, West, East and Centre. The centrist Constitution of 1886 divided the country into departments, the departments into provinces, and the provinces into municipalities. The provinces were abolished in 1911 by Executive Decree No. 306, and several municipalities were separated off to form the commissariat of Arauca. Afterward the municipalities in the Orinoco region formed the intendency of Casanare as a newly annexed territory of Boyac√° Department until 1973, when it split off again.  Economy  Main economical activity of Oicat√° is agriculture with products potatoes, maize, barley, wheat, peas and beans.  Climate  Oicata's climate is influenced by its location and altitude. At almost 3000 m it is one of the higher cities in Colombia. As a result, the city features a subtropical highland climate (K√∂ppen Cfb) with little variation in temperature throughout the year but a distinct dry season from December to February.

Dynaflex is a trademark for a thin, lightweight vinyl LP record introduced by RCA Records in late 1969. Rather than using the stiff plastic material used by conventional vinyl pressings, Dynaflex records used a softer, pliable formulation that allowed RCA to use less material, saving money and also making the record appear to lie flatter on turntables. At the time, as a cost- cutting measure, most industry record pressing plants were using recycled or \\"reground\\" vinyl, taking old and unsold records, cutting out the center with the paper labels, then melting the rest down and reusing the material to make new records. Such \\"reground\\" vinyl records typically sounded much noisier and scratchier when played than a record made from new or \\"virgin\\" vinyl; collectors noted that \\"reground\\" records sometimes had small remnants of paper labels embedded in the outer edge of the LP. RCA's Dynaflex records varied somewhat in thickness, but most literally \\"flopped\\" back and forth when held between the hands. Some were so thin and flexible they could actually be bent nearly in half. This flexibility also gave them theoretically more resiliency in shipping, resulting in fewer returns from retailers due to breakage and cracks. Opinions from record collectors and audiophiles are divided as to Dynaflex's sound quality. Some felt that the sound quality actually improved, due to the purer vinyl used, and better processes for removing impurities in the vinyl compounds; others felt that Dynaflex pressings were noisier and lacked bass frequencies compared to conventional records, and also had more \\"rumble\\" (low frequency noise) than conventional thick pressings. While RCA claimed that Dynaflex records were less noisy and less susceptible to warpage and would last longer than conventional vinyl records, some consumers (particularly classical listeners) derisively referred to the new product as 'Dynawarp' because of evidence that Dynaflex records were prone to warp on dealers' shelves, just from the pressure of the shrinkwrap on the album jacket. Some critics charged that Dynaflex was nothing more than a ploy devised by RCA to save money by using less vinyl material than in traditional, thicker records. RCA Records apparently never fully implemented the use of Dynaflex, as regular thicker vinyl records continued to be manufactured. Many titles issued by RCA were available in both Dynaflex and heavier vinyl pressings. Around approximately 1974, RCA began to gradually reduce the number of Dynaflex records being manufactured. RCA Records quietly discontinued Dynaflex entirely, sometime in the late 1970s.

Most of his stunts are performed on a Quad bike. In 2000, he created two new \\"Guinness Book of Records\\" records by jumping 14 4 x 4 jeeps and 4 moving 4 x 4 jeeps. In a wild west theme park outside of Cornwall, England, His double failure at jumping over a Paddle steamer named the Lady Retallack on his quad bike appeared on television. Years later, Matt admitted to crashing due to not having a clue what he was doing back then. Being the first person to jump a Quad a long distance he has said he had a few crashes before he learned the trade. The Paddle Steamer jumps have aired on TV all over the world on documentaries and action sports shows since 1992 and still do to this day. Early life Matt's story begins in 1969 in Mornington Australia and takes him on a journey to America, France, Italy, Holland and finally to the UK where in 1989 he embarks on a career as a showman. At the age of seven Matt's mum Joy bought him a 50cc Honda from the local hardware store. Not long after that Joy found herself taking him along to the local schoolboy motorcross events and found that her son had a natural ability for racing. Matt progressed to Quad bikes when they were imported into Australia and was one of the first to compete in the newly formed Australian Quad Racing Championships. After becoming Australian 250cc champion he took off for America to compete in the USA Quad Championships. Matt then went on to compete in the French, Italian and UK championships, becoming the Italian and UK Champion. Career Matt's career as a showman took off when he started to perform at county and motor shows around the UK. On 13 November 1991, Matt attempted his first Paddle Steamer jump over the 20 ft Lady Retallack on a canal at a Wild West theme park in Cornwall, England. Using an 8 ft high ramp, Matt had done little preparation and had agreed to the jump without thinking about the consequences. His back wheels hit the top of the paddle steamer, taking out a funnel and causing Matt to be catapulted facefirst into the canal. Mike Bryant, the cameraman, was convinced Matt had killed himself, but to everyone's amazement he was pulled from the canal with only a few bruised ribs. On 13 August 1992, he attempted the same jump with a bigger ramp 25 ft high and 100 ft long. However, the landing conditions for his bike were unfit and there was a crosswind. He ripped every ligament in his knee and a nerve, leaving his left leg partially paralyzed. He was airlifted out, and released after 2 weeks in the hospital. When Matt returned to his home country to perform at a number of shows, he was shocked to find that he had testicular cancer. It was midway through the tour and he again convinced the doctors to go against their better judgement by allowing him to perform at his weekend show and then operate on him on the Monday morning. Matt also sustained an injury when he set his first Guinness World Record, he landed very hard and had to be driven to the hospital with suspected concussion, which turned out to be severe bruising to the brain. He was kept in hospital for the following week. Matt would also show a different side of himself when he saw people in difficulty or was asked to help someone less fortunate than himself. Matt's friends are aware of the big kind heart he has and they were not surprised when he offered to do many shows, free of charge, for charity. Or when he helped Graham Hicks, the deaf and blind quad rider to achieve a world record in 2001. Around this time Matt also jumped over a flying airplane, Firstly in the UK and then a bigger plane in the USA just outside Las Vegas. In 2005, after two very busy years Matt decided to take time out from the UK show circuit and only performed at four shows in the UK in 2006. Matt did another full season in the UK in 2009 but then took another few years off away from the UK show circuit. In 2013 The Kangaroo Kid made his comeback to the UK show circuit. This time bringing with him his Joey (Sam Coulter). The two stunt riders performed at over thirty different events in 2013, bringing record crowds to many of the events. Due to the success of the 2013 season and because of a huge demand, the Kangaroo Kids decided to come back in 2014. In 2015 Matt Introduced his friend and Quad racing champion Paul Hannam from Devon to the show while his son Sam went to pursue other endeavours. Also in February 2015 Matt had a full knee replacement on his left knee to repair years of ongoing damage and pain caused from the Paddle steamer 2 jump. He started the season on time and jumped as normal only 11 weeks after the operation. In July 2017, The Kangaroo Kid was performing at the Royal Welsh Show in Builth Wells when Matt fell off his Quad Bike while completing a stunt over a 30 tonne dump truck. He was Airlifted to Morriston Hospital in Swansea as a precautionary measure. He sustains an injury each to his shoulder, leg, and rib, but no serious injuries. Matt kept riding for the rest of the season and had a shoulder operation to rebuild his shoulder at the end of the season. 2018 show season marks the 30th year since Matt did his first stunt show.

An ogre lived nearby, with a magnificent horse, and finally the servants said that the king should send Corvetto to steal it. Corvetto went, and jumped on the horse. It shouted to its master, who chased after with wild animals (one of them being a Werewolf), but Corvetto rode it off. The king was even more pleased, and the other servants told him to send Corvetto after the ogre's tapestry. Corvetto went, hid under the ogres' bed, and in the night stole both the tapestries and the counterpane from the bed (causing the ogre and ogress to argue about who hogged them). He dropped them from a window and fled back to the king. The servants then persuaded him to send Corvetto for the entire palace. He went and talked with the ogress, offering to help her. She asked him to split wood for her. He used the axe on her neck. Then he dug a deep pit in the doorway and covered it. He lured the ogre and his friends into it, stoned them to death, and gave the king the palace.

The essential element of the mass line is consulting the masses, interpreting their suggestions within the framework of Marxism-Leninism, and then enforcing the resulting policies. Mao developed it into a coherent organizing methodology that encompasses philosophy, strategy, tactics, leadership and organizational theory that has been applied by many communists subsequent to the Chinese revolution. Chinese communist leaders generally attribute their conquest of power to the faithful pursuit of effective \\"mass line\\" tactics, and a \\"correct\\" mass line is supposed to be the essential prerequisite for the full consolidation of power.Steiner, Arthur H., \\"Current 'Mass Line' Tactics in Communist China\\", The American Political Science Review, Vol. 45, No. 2 (Jun., 1951), pp. 422-436 History and 20th century origins Training in mass line tactics ranges in scope from propaganda to public administration, according to UCLA professor Arthur Steiner. Its principal focus, however, is in the \\"delicate area\\" of the CCP's dealings with the masses of Chinese people who have not yet bought into the communist program. In the early 1950s, the problem was sufficiently serious and urgent that CCP leadership temporarily deferred several important social reforms pending the completion of the cadre training program. Thus, in its original conception, the mass line referred to both an ideological goal as well as a working method based on \\"pooling the wisdom of the masses\\" () from which CCP leadership could formulate policy after further deliberation, adjustments, implementation and experimentation, which would in turn continue to receive feedback from the masses. After recognizing that large numbers of cadres properly trained in mass line tactics were critically needed for the CCP's building of a \\"complete socialist order\\", the Party intensified its cadre training program in 1950‚Äì1951 to ensure that all cadres and other workers would be \\"carefully indoctrinated in basic Marxist-Leninist mass line theory and practice\\". Steiner writes that Mao rose to pre-eminence in the CCP because he understood the requirements for effecting the strongest possible organization of the Chinese masses in unstable political circumstances. Since the days of his early activity among the peasantry of Hunan Province, Mao preached that the Party must rely on the masses for its strength, that it must serve their needs, \\"draw inspiration\\" from them, and orient its political ideology and organizational tactics to their responsiveness. Mao criticized Joseph Stalin for a lack of faith in the peasantry and the masses of people, being mechanical in his understanding of the development of socialism, and not actively engaging the masses in the struggle for socialism. Regarding Stalin, Mao wrote in 1961: Politics in command' and the 'mass line' are not stressed. There is no discussion of 'walking on two legs', and individual material interest is onesidedly emphasized. Material incentives are proclaimed and individualism is far too prominent.\\" The Mass Line is a method of leadership that seeks ostensibly to \\"learn from the peasants.\\" Mao's slogan was \\"From the masses, to the masses\\". The process is said to include investigating the conditions of people, learning about and participating in their struggles, gathering ideas from them, and creating a plan of action based on these ideas and concerns of the people, and also based on an analysis of the objective conditions and in light of the revolutionary goal. Some critics of Maoism consider the mass line to be a form of populism, a criticism that Lenin had leveled against the reformists in the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in What Is To Be Done?. 21st century revival One of the distinctive features of the national leadership of Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping has been the revival of the mass line in Communist Party theory and praxis. As of 2014, this revival is still ongoing, and is reportedly \\"not a short-term movement\\". A new official website has been launched, focusing on the mass line. In his own words, Xi has described the campaign in terms of \\"purification\\" of the Communist Party, often involving the elimination of \\"hedonism and extravagance\\", although the purification implied is sometimes extended metaphorically to issues such as \\"reducing air pollution\\". As part of this campaign, Xi Jinping has declared that \\"All Party organs and members should be frugal and make determined efforts to oppose ostentation and reject hedonism\\", although the interpretation of what this means seems to have varied from one province to the next somewhat. Hebei province reportedly reduced public spending on official receptions by 24%, cancelled the order of 17,000 new cars, and punished 2,750 government officials. The Economist reported two specific examples of punishments under the new mass line: the suspended death sentence for corruption given to Liu Zhijun and charging the 17-year-old-son of a high-ranking military officer for an alleged connection to a gang rape. Perhaps 20,000 party officials were punished within the first year of the revival campaign. Some China experts argue that: \\"If implemented not as a propaganda tool but as a mechanism of interest articulation and aggregation, the mass line has the potential to offer China alternative routes of democratization.\\" Connection with propaganda According to Steiner, the mass line is closely related to the CCP's propaganda apparatus. Despite the vast output from the CCP's propaganda apparatus, in January 1951 the Central Committee published a directive condemning as a \\"principal weakness of the Party's propaganda\\" a failure to effectively give \\"systematic guidance and control of various levels of party organizations\\". The directive said that \\"One of the inborn duties of a Communist lies in the incessant effort to carry out propaganda among the people so as to educate them, to wage relentless war against all reactionary and mistaken conceptions and principles, and to promote as well as raise the political consciousness of the masses.\\" The directive called for the establishment of networks of \\"propaganda officers\\"‚Äîone in every party cell‚Äîand \\"reporting officers\\" at higher levels. Propaganda activity was to be conducted among the masses under strict control and in \\"fixed activity programs\\". Among other duties, propaganda officers were to maintain \\"constant public contact\\" so they could \\"assist the Party in the choice of propaganda matter and methods appropriate for different periods of time\\". Earlier directives connected the need to boost consciousness of the mass line with criticisms and self- criticisms in the press. Party members were supposed to \\"be trained to appreciate that criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals are necessary methods for strengthening the relations between the Party and the popular masses\\". Mass organizations During the Maoist era the state supported a range of mass organizations, coordinated by the CCP through the united front system. The most significant of the mass organizations encompassed large numbers of people from major social groups, including workers through trade unions, students, youth, and women. Their purpose was to \\"penetrate society, to bring vast sections of the population further into the party's net\\", Teiwes writes. The effort was skewed, however, and coverage was far more extensive in urban areas, with peasant associations existing only sporadically. Influence outside the Chinese Communist Party The largest self-proclaimed Maoist party in the US, the Revolutionary Communist Party, adopted the concept of \\"mass line\\" during the 1970s.

Definition Let H_1, H_2 be Hilbert spaces, and T a (linear) bounded operator from H_1 to H_2. For p\\\\in [1,\\\\infty), define the Schatten p-norm of T as : \\\\T\\\\ _{p} = \\\\mathrm{Tr} (T^p)^{\\\\frac{1}{p}}.

Properties In the following we formally extend the range of p to [1,\\\\infty] with the convention that \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\_{\\\\infty} is the operator norm. The dual index to p=\\\\infty is then q=1. * The Schatten norms are unitarily invariant: for unitary operators U and V and p\\\\in [1,\\\\infty], :: \\\\U T V\\\\_p = \\\\T\\\\_p. * They satisfy H√∂lder's inequality: for all p\\\\in [1,\\\\infty] and q such that \\\\frac{1}{p} + \\\\frac{1}{q} = 1, and operators S\\\\in\\\\mathcal{L}(H_2,H_3), T\\\\in\\\\mathcal{L}(H_1,H_2) defined between Hilbert spaces H_1, H_2, and H_3 respectively, :: \\\\ST\\\\_1 \\\\leq \\\\S\\\\_p \\\\T\\\\_q.

For p\\\\in(0,1) the function \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\_p is an example of a quasinorm. An operator which has a finite Schatten norm is called a Schatten class operator and the space of such operators is denoted by S_p(H_1,H_2). With this norm, S_p(H_1,H_2) is a Banach space, and a Hilbert space for p = 2\\\\. Observe that S_p(H_1,H_2) \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{K} (H_1,H_2), the algebra of compact operators. This follows from the fact that if the sum is finite the spectrum will be finite or countable with the origin as limit point, and hence a compact operator (see compact operator on Hilbert space).

The village lies about southwest of Bandon, and near Clonakilty and Kinsale. The coastal route around the edge of the parish is the R600 road. The village itself is around inland from the coast. Local estates Kilbrittain Castle is reputed to be one of the oldest inhabited castles in Ireland. The castle is thought to date from 1035 where the original fortress may have been built by the O'Mahony clan. Known to have been in the hands of the Norman family of de Courcey and possibly extended in the 13th century, Kilbrittain Castle was the principal seat of MacCarthy Reagh family, Princes of Carbery, from the early 15th century. The castle was extensively restored and enlarged by the Stawell family in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was partially burned in 1920 and restored in 1969 by inventor Russell Winn. Kilbrittain Castle is now the home of the Cahill-O'Brien family. Howes Strand is a beach in Kilbrittain with the ruin of a Coast Guard station that overlooks the beach, built in 1910 and burnt down in 1920. Coolmain Castle was originally built by the de Courcey family in the early 15th century, but they lost it to the MacCarthy Reaghs, the Princes of Desmond, the following century. Over the years it passed through the hands of a number of families, including that of the Earls of Cork. In the middle of the 17th century, Oliver Cromwell acquired the property. In the early 1900s it was owned by the novelist Donn Byrne, and was bought by Roy E. Disney in the 1990s. Sport Kilbrittain GAA club fields Gaelic football and hurling teams and is affiliated with Cork GAA and Carbery GAA. The club was founded in 1904. The club won the Cork Minor C Football Championship in 2008 beating Castletownbere in the final at P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh. Education There are two primary schools in Kilbrittain. Gurraneasig National School is located near to Howes Strand and (as of 2009) had approximately 60 pupils enrolled. Kilbrittain National School is a co-educational school which is located in the village, close to the church. As of 2011, Kilbrittain National School had over 150 pupils enrolled. Both schools take part in GAA leagues called Sciath na Scol. Kilbrittain NS have won it with both the boys and girls team on several occasions. Culture and events Each summer, the owners of Burren House, which overlooks Courtmacsherry Bay, hold an open-air opera to raise funds in aid of the Courtmacsherry Lifeboat. Annually in August, Kilbrittain hosts a family festival. Kilbrittain Festival has been running since 2004. In 2011, a short film, The Blow-Ins, was shot in Kilbrittain and Courtmacsherry; the film was released in 2012. Kilbrittain whale On 15 January 2009, an 18-metre (59 ft) fin whale became stranded and subsequently died on a beach in Courtmacsherry Bay, after becoming disorientated and lured by unusually high tides. Efforts were made by Courtmacsherry Lifeboat to get the whale back into the sea but a combination of its size and weight meant that attempts to save the whale's life were unsuccessful. The whale was featured in a Channel 4 documentary \\"Inside Nature's Giants\\" which showed autopsies of large mammals. There was some dispute as to whether Kilbrittain or Courtmacsherry had the claim to the whale and local songwriter, Michael O'Brien of Butlerstown, composed and recorded a humorous song on the topic titled \\"The Kilmacsherry Whale\\". On the CD \\"Quare Times -Songs and Rhymes to see us through\\", 2009. The skeleton of the whale is now on display in a small park to the east of the village. Book of Lismore It is believed that the Book of Lismore was compiled in the 15th Century to commemorate the marriage of the Gaelic prince Finghin Mac C√°rthaigh Riabhach, of Kilbrittain Castle, to Caitil√≠n, daughter of the seventh Earl of Desmond. The medieval manuscript contains 166 large vellum folios of material that a learned person of the time would have been expected to know. It later became known as Leabhar Mhic C√°rthaigh Riabhaigh. MacCarthy was patron of the friary at Timoleague, and some of the book's pages were copied there in 1629 by the scribe M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh. During a raid on Kilbrittain in 1642, the book was taken by Lewis, Lord Kinalmeaky, of Lismore who sent it back to his father, with a letter, at Lismore Castle. The book remained there until it was discovered behind a wall at the castle in 1814, during rebuilding works. The Book of Lismore is written in Irish, but not the modern version spoken today. It is written on vellum, made from calfskin, an expensive material at the time of the book's writing, in the 15th century. The Book of Lismore contains many important texts, including a cosmological work, the Ever-new Tongue; the most extensive account of the lives of the saints in an Irish-language medieval manuscript; an Irish translation of the travels of Marco Polo; and one of the greatest compositions of the Fenian Cycle, Acallam na Sen√≥rach, or The Conversation of the Old Men. The illustrated capitals are thought to have been added in the 19th century by Donnchadh √ì Floinn, an Irish-language scribe living on Shandon Street in Cork.

Remote desktop applications have varying features. Some allow attaching to an existing user's session (i.e., a running desktop) and \\"remote controlling\\", either displaying the remote control session or blanking the screen. Taking over a desktop remotely is a form of remote administration.  Overview  Remote access can also be explained as remote control of a computer by using another device connected via the internet or another network. This is widely used by many computer manufacturers and large businesses' help desks for technical troubleshooting of their customers' problems. Remote desktop software captures the mouse and keyboard inputs from the local computer (client) and sends them to the remote computer (server). The remote computer in turn sends the display commands to the local computer. When applications with many graphics including video or 3D models need to be controlled remotely, a remote workstation software that sends the pixels rather than the display commands must be used to provide a smooth, like-local experience. HP Remote Graphics Software is one such remote workstation solution. Remote desktop sharing is accomplished through a common client/server model. The client, or VNC viewer, is installed on a local computer and then connects via a network to a server component, which is installed on the remote computer. In a typical VNC session, all keystrokes and mouse clicks are registered as if the client were actually performing tasks on the end-user machine.Virtual Network Computing (VNC): Making Remote Desktop Sharing Possible. Businessnewsdaily.com (2013-11-07). Retrieved on 2014-02-27. The target computer in a remote desktop scenario is still able to access all of its core functions. Many of these core functions, including the main clipboard, can be shared between the target computer and remote desktop client.  Uses  A main use of remote desktop software is remote administration and remote implementation. This need arises when software buyers are far away from their software vendor. Most remote access software can be used for \\"headless computers\\": instead of each computer having its own monitor, keyboard, and mouse, or using a KVM switch, one computer can have a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and remote control software, and control many headless computers. The duplicate desktop mode is useful for user support and education. Remote control software combined with telephone communication can be nearly as helpful for novice computer-users as if the support staff were actually there. Since the advent of cloud computing remote desktop software can be housed on USB hardware devices, allowing users to connect the device to any PC connected to their network or the Internet and recreate their desktop via a connection to the cloud. This model avoids one problem with remote desktop software, which requires the local computer to be switched on at the time when the user wishes to access it remotely. (It is possible with a router with C2S VPN support, and Wake on LAN equipment, to establish a virtual private network (VPN) connection with the router over the Internet if not connected to the LAN, switch on a computer connected to the router, then connect to it.) Remote desktop products are available in three models: hosted service, software, and appliance. Tech support scammers use Remote Desktop software to connect to their victim‚Äôs computer and will often Syskey the computer if the victim does not cooperate. Many Remote Desktop softwares have worked against this, however. The most notable being TeamViewer which warns the user of an incoming connection from India since most tech support scammers are from India.  Protocols  Remote desktop protocols include the following: * Apple Remote Desktop Protocol (ARD) Original protocol for Apple Remote Desktop on macOS machines. * Appliance Link Protocol (ALP) a Sun Microsystems-specific protocol featuring audio (play and record), remote printing, remote USB, accelerated video * HP Remote Graphics Software (RGS) a proprietary protocol designed by Hewlett-Packard specifically for high end workstation remoting and collaboration. * Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) a proprietary protocol designed by Citrix Systems * NX technology (NX) a proprietary protocol designed by NoMachine with open-source derivatives available from other forked projects. * PC-over-IP (PCoIP) a proprietary protocol used by VMware (licensed from Teradici) * Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) a Windows-specific protocol featuring audio and remote printing * Remote Frame Buffer Protocol (RFB) A framebuffer level cross-platform protocol that VNC is based on. * SPICE (Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments) ‚Äì remote-display system built for virtual environments by Qumranet, now Red Hat * Splashtop a high performance remote desktop protocol developed by Splashtop, fully optimized for hardware (H.264) including Intel / AMD chipsets, NVIDIA / ATI GPU & APU, Qualcomm Snapdragon, and NVIDIA Tegra.

History From 1969 onwards Giles BrindleyBrindley GS, Polkey CE, Rushton DN (1982): Sacral anterior root stimulator for bladder control in paraplegia. Paraplegia 20: 365-381. developed the sacral anterior root stimulator, with successful human trials from the early 1980s onwards. Although both sphincter and detrusor muscles are stimulated at the same time, the slower contraction kinetics of the bladder wall (smooth muscle tissue) compared to the sphincter (striated muscle tissue) mean that voiding occurs between the stimulation pulses, rather than during them. Description This device is implanted over the sacral anterior root of the spinal cord; controlled by an external transmitter, it delivers intermittent stimulation which improves the ability to empty the bladder. It may also assist in defecation and also may enable male patients to have a sustained full erection. The device is implanted in one of two regions, either through intrathecal administration or extradurally. It is often performed in conjunction with a dorsal rhizotomy, and many groups believe that the best results are only seen when this procedure is performed alongside the implantation. The rhizotomy will remove sensory reflexes, which in men may include sexual reflexes. For some patients this is a major drawback to the device. For others, the benefits outweigh the downside. The related procedure of sacral nerve stimulation is to control incontinence in otherwise able- bodied patients.Schmidt RA, Jonas A, Oleson KA, Janknegt RA, Hassouna MM, Siegel SW, van Kerrebroeck PE.

Acetoacetate decarboxylase plays a key role in solvent production by catalyzing the decarboxylation of acetoacetate, yielding acetone and carbon dioxide. This enzyme has been of particular interest because it is a classic example of how pKa values of ionizable groups in the enzyme active site can be significantly perturbed. Specifically, the pKa value of lysine 115 in the active site is unusually low, allowing for the formation of a Schiff base intermediate and catalysis.  History  Acetoacetate decarboxylase is an enzyme with major historical implications, specifically in World War I and in establishing the state of Israel. During the war the Allies needed pure acetone as a solvent for nitro-cellulose, a highly flammable compound that is the main component in gunpowder. In 1916, biochemist and future first president of Israel Chaim Weizmann was the first to isolate Clostridium acetobutylicum, a Gram-positive, anaerobic bacteria in which acetoacetate decarboxylase is found. Weizmann was able to harness the organism's ability to yield acetone from starch in order to mass-produce explosives during the war. This led the American and British governments to install the process devised by Chaim Weizmann in several large plants in England, France, Canada, and the United States. Through Weizmann's scientific contributions in World War I, he became close with influential British leaders educating them of his Zionist beliefs. One of them was Arthur Balfour, the man after whom the Balfour Declaration‚Äîthe first document pronouncing British support in the establishment of a Jewish homeland‚Äîwas named. The production of acetone by acetoacetate decarboxylase-containing or clostridial bacteria was utilized in large-scale industrial syntheses in the first half of the twentieth century. In the 1960s, the industry replaced this process with less expensive, more efficient chemical syntheses of acetone from petroleum and petroleum derivatives. However, there has been a growing interest in acetone production that is more environmentally friendly, causing a resurgence in utilizing acetoacetate decarboxylase-containing bacteria. Similarly, isopropanol and butanol fermentation using clostridial species is also becoming popular. Structure Crystal structure of acetoacetate decarboxylase in complex with an inhibitor, pentan-2-one. Using the residue Lys115, this inhibitor forms an acetyl acetone Schiff base intermediate. Mostly hydrophobic residues, such as Met 97 and Phe27, are found in the active site. This image was generated using PyMOL, from PDB ID 3BH3. Acetoacetate decarboxylase is a 365 kDa complex with a homododecameric structure. The overall structure consists of antiparallel Œ≤-sheets and a central seven- stranded cone-shaped Œ≤-barrel. The core of this Œ≤-barrel surrounds the active site in each protomer of the enzyme. The active site, consisting of residues such as Phe27, Met97, and Tyr113, is mostly hydrophobic. However, the active site does contain two charged residues: Arg29 and Glu76. Arg29 is thought to play a role in substrate binding, while Glu76 is thought to play a role in the orienting the active site for catalysis. The overall hydrophobic environment of the active site plays a critical role in favoring the neutral amine form of Lys115, a key residue involved in the formation of a Schiff base intermediate. Another important lysine residue, Lys116, is thought to play an important role in the positioning of Lys115 in the active site. Through hydrogen bonds with Ser16 and Met210, Lys116 positions Lys115 in the hydrophobic pocket of the active site to favor the neutral amine form. Reaction mechanism Figure 1: General mechanism of acetoacetate decarboxylase, proceeding through a Schiff base intermediate and producing acetone and carbon dioxide Acetoacetate decarboxylase from Clostridium acetobutylicum catalyzes the decarboxylation of acetoacetate to yield acetone and carbon dioxide (Figure 1). The reaction mechanism proceeds via the formation of a Schiff base intermediate, which is covalently attached to lysine 115 in the active site. The first line of support for this mechanism came from a radiolabeling experiment in which researchers labeled the carbonyl group of acetoacetate with 18O and observed that oxygen exchange to water, used as the solvent, is a necessary part of decarboxylation step. These results provided support that the mechanism proceeds through a Schiff base intermediate between the ketoacid and an amino acid residue on the enzyme. Further research led to the isolation of an active site peptide sequence and identification of the active site lysine, Lys115, that is involved in the formation of the Schiff base intermediate. Additionally, later experiments led to the finding that maximum activity of the enzyme occurs at pH 5.95, suggesting that the pKa of the Œµ-ammonium group of Lys115 is significantly perturbed in the active site. If the pKa were not perturbed downward, the lysine residue would remain protonated as an ammonium cation, making it unreactive for the nucleophilic addition necessary to form the Schiff base. Figure 2: Scheme of the reaction, with reporter molecule 5-NSA, used by Westheimer et al. to measure the pKa of Lys115 in the active site. Building upon this finding, Westheimer et al. directly measured the pKa of Lys115 in the active site using 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde (5-NSA) . Reaction of 5-NSA with acetoacetate decarboxylase and subsequent reduction of the resulting Schiff base with sodium borohydride led to the incorporation of a 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzylamino reporter molecule in the active site (Figure 2). Titration of the enzyme with this attached reporter group revealed that the pKa of Lys115 is decreased to 5.9 in the active site. These results were the basis for the proposal that the perturbation in the pKa of Lys115 was due to its proximity to the positively charged Œµ-ammonium group of Lys116 in the active site. A nearby positive charge could cause unfavorable electrostatic repulsions that weaken the N-H bond of Lys115. Westheimer et al.'s proposal was further supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies. When Lys116 was mutated to cysteine or asparagine, the pKa of Lys115 was found to be significantly elevated to over 9.2, indicating that positively charged Lys116 plays a critical role in determining the pKa of Lys115. Although a crystal structure was not yet solved to provide structural evidence, this proposal was widely accepted and cited as a textbook example of how the active site can be precisely organized to perturb a pKa and affect reactivity. In 2009, a crystal structure of acetoacetate decarboxylase from Clostridium acetobutylicum was solved, allowing Westheimer et al.'s proposal to be evaluated from a new perspective . From the crystal structure, researchers found that Lys 115 and Lys 116 are oriented in opposite directions and separated by 14.8 √Ö (Figure 3). This distance makes it unlikely that the positive charge of Lys116 is able to affect the pKa of Lys115. Instead through hydrogen bonds with Ser16 and Met210, Lys116 likely holds Lys115 into position in a hydrophobic pocket of the active site. This positioning disrupts the stability of the protonated ammonium cation of Lys115, suggesting that the perturbation of Lys115's pKa occurs through a 'desolvation effect'. Figure 3: Orientation of Lysine 115 and 116. In the active site, lysine 115 and 116 point away from each other and are separated by 14.8 √Ö. This image was generated using PyMOL, from PDB ID 3BH3. Inactivation and inhibition Acetoacetate decarboxylase is inhibited by a number of compounds. Acetic anhydride performs an electrophilic attack on the critical catalytic residue, Lys115, of acetoacetate decarboxylase to inactivate the enzyme. The rate of inactivation was assessed through the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate 2,4-dinitrophenyl propionate to dinitrophenol by acetoacetate decarboxylase. In the presence of acetic anhydride, the enzyme is inactivated, unable to catalyze the hydrolysis reaction 2,4-dinitrophenyl propionate to dinitrophenol. Acetonylsulfonate acts as a competitive inhibitor (KI=8.0 mM ) as it mimics the characteristics of the natural substrate, acetoacetate (KM=8.0 mM). The monoanion version of acetonylphosphonate is also a good inhibitor (KI=0.8mM), more efficient than the acetonylphosphonate monoester or dianion. These findings indicate that active site is very discriminatory and sterically restricted. Hydrogen cyanide seems to be an uncompetitive inhibitor, combining with Schiff's base compounds formed at the active site. Addition of carbonyl compounds to the enzyme, in the presence of hydrogen cyanide, increases hydrogen cyanide's ability to inhibit acetoacetate decarboxylase, suggesting that carbonyl compounds readily form Schiff's bases at the active site. Hydrogen cyanide is most potent as an inhibitor at pH 6, the optimum pH for the enzyme, suggesting that the rate- limiting step of catalysis is the formation of the Schiff base intermediate. Beta-diketones appear to inhibit acetoacetate decarboxylase well but slowly. Acetoacetate decarboxylase has a KM for acetoacetate of 7√ó10‚àí3 M whereas the enzyme has a KI for benzoylacetone of 1.9√ó10‚àí6 M. An enamine is most likely formed upon interaction of beta-diketones with free enzyme. The reaction of acetoacetate decarboxylase with p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate (CMS) results in decreased catalytic activity upon two equivalents of CMS per enzyme subunit. CMS interacts with two sulfhydryl groups located on each enzyme subunit. Further inactivation occurs upon addition of a third equivalent of CMS per subunit. Addition of free cysteine to the inhibited enzyme is able to reverse CMS inhibition of acetoacetate decarboxylase.  Activity in bacteria  Acetoacetate decarboxylase has been found and studied in the following bacteria in addition to Clostridium acetobutylicum: * Bacillus polymyxa * Chromobacterium violaceum * Clostridium beijerinckii * Clostridium cellulolyticum * Pseudomonas putida  Activity in humans and mammals  While this enzyme has not been purified from human tissue, the activity was shown to be present in human blood serum. In humans and other mammals, the conversion of acetoacetate into acetone and carbon dioxide by acetoacetate decarboxylase is a final irreversible step in the ketone-body pathway that supplies the body with a secondary source of energy. In the liver, acetyl co-A formed from fats and lipids are transformed into three ketone bodies: acetone, acetoacetate, and D-Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate. Acetoacetate and D-Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate are exported to non-hepatic tissues, where they are converted back into acetyl-coA and used for fuel. Acetone and carbon dioxide on the other hand are exhaled, and not allowed to accumulate under normal conditions. Acetoacetate and D-Œ≤- hydroxybutyrate freely interconvert through the action of D-Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. Subsequently, one function of acetoacetate decarboxylase may be to regulate the concentrations of the other, two 4-carbon ketone bodies.  Clinical significance  Ketone body production increases significantly when the rate of glucose metabolism is insufficient in meeting the body's energy needs. Such conditions include high-fat ketogenic diets, diabetic ketoacidosis, or severe starvation. Under elevated levels of acetoacetate and D-Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate decarboxylase produces significantly more acetone. Acetone is toxic, and can accumulate in the body under these conditions. Elevated levels of acetone in the human breath can be used to diagnose diabetes.

One of the largest of Georgia's barrier islands, Ossabaw contains of wooded uplands with freshwater ponds and of marshlands interlaced with tidal creeks. Located between Wassaw Island and the Ogeechee River on the north and St. Catherines Island on the south, the island is not linked to the mainland by bridge or causeway. At , it is the third-largest barrier island off the coast of Georgia.  History  Evidence of human presence extends for at least 4,000 years based on pottery sherds unearthed from the island's numerous oyster shell middens. It was inhabited by the Guale Indians at the time of the Spanish exploration of the Georgia coast in the early 16th century. Throughout the Spanish mission period the Guale alternately supplied and fought with the Spanish. When English occupation of the area replaced the Spanish in the 1730s, the Guale had moved inland possibly in response to disease and coastal marauding under the Spanish. The earliest English treaties reserved the island as hunting and fishing grounds for the Creek Indians. In 1758 a group of Creek leaders was persuaded to convey the island to King George II of England. In 1760 the island passed into private ownership and was farmed and timbered with slave labor and was eventually divided into four plantations. After the American Civil War the island was farmed on a small scale by several owners and tenant farmers until the early 20th century. In 1907 Savannah native, Henry D. Weed, purchased over 9000 acres of the island, and by 1916 Weed was the island's sole owner.New Georgia Encyclopedia http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/geography-environment/ossabaw- island After 1916 it was used as a hunting retreat while owned by a group of wealthy businessman until it was purchased in 1924 by Dr. Henry Norton Torrey of Detroit, Michigan and his wife Nell Ford Torrey daughter of Emery L Ford and Ella Neat of Indiana. In 1961 The Ossabaw Foundation created by Eleanor Torrey West and Clifford B. West launched the Ossabaw Island Project as an artistic and scholarly retreat. Over the years the island's solitude and natural beauty served as the setting for such luminaries as: composers Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber; writers Ralph Ellison, Annie Dillard, Olive Ann Burns, and Margaret Atwood; sculptor Harry Bertoia; and scientist Eugene Odum among many others. The Ossabaw Foundation was also host to The Genesis Project, scientific research and public use and education programs on the island. In 1978, no longer able to subsidize the artistic, educational, and scientific activity on the island, and eschewing lucrative offers of resort development, Mrs. West and her brother's children chose to sell the island to the State of Georgia as a Heritage Preserve with the understanding that Ossabaw would \\"be used for natural, scientific and cultural study, research and education, and environmentally sound preservation, conservation and management of the Island's ecosystem.\\"  Ossabaw today  Currently Ossabaw is managed by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR), which has entered into a Use Agreement with The Ossabaw Island Foundation, a Savannah-based non-profit organization which regulates access and use of historic areas. The foundation works cooperatively with the State of Georgia's DNR to manage access to Ossabaw for public educational programs. The Ossabaw Island Foundation, a public charity established in 1994, defines its mission as \\"[The Foundation]...in a public-private partnership with the State of Georgia, inspires, promotes, and manages exceptional educational, cultural, and scientific programs that are designed to maximize the experience of Ossabaw Island, while minimizing the impact on its resources.\\" The general public must apply to visit. The Foundation follows the guidelines established by Mrs. West and embodied in the Heritage Preserve of 1978: The island is open to groups engaged in study, research and education. Those groups include young people, adult interest groups, colleges and universities, teachers, artists and researchers. Some examples of the research that occurs on in the island involves nesting of loggerhead sea turtles, monitoring migratory bird patterns, investigating tooth wear of deer fawns and genetic studies on feral Sicilian donkeys. Ossabaw Island Comprehensive Management Plan says the hogs and donkeys are to be removed. Presumably, the way the document is written, the feral horses will also be removed. Ossabawisland.org states \\"all remaining donkeys have been sterilized to prevent future generations.\\" See also *USS Water Witch (1851), Union ship captured in Ossabaw Sound by Confederates during American Civil War * Ossabaw Island Hog *Kilkenny (Richmond Hill, Georgia)  References  Relevant publications *Foskey, Ann Images of America, Ossabaw Island (2001) 128 pages includes extensive photos *Stuckey, Jill (photographer), Evan Kutzler (narrative). 2016.

The battle (actually better described as an ambush), pitched approximately 450 French and allied Indian forces under the leadership of Ensign de Corbiere of the Troupes de la Marine against 350 New Jersey Blues under the command of Colonel John Parker. Ensign de Corbiere, aware of Colonel Parker's plan, ambushed and surrounded Parker's forces as they approached the shore in bateaux (shallow-draft, flat-bottomed boats). In the ensuing rout Colonel Parker lost approximately 250 men with nearly 160 men killed or drowned and the rest taken prisoner. The French reported only one man slightly wounded.  Background  During March 1757 Fort William Henry came under siege for four days by French forces. Lacking sufficient logistical and artillery support, and hampered further by a blinding snowstorm on 21 March, French forces were unable to take the fort and the siege was called off. Although the French failed to take the fort itself, their forces did destroy three hundred bateaux and several lightly armed vessels beached on the shore, a saw-mill and numerous outbuildings.Fowler, p. 114 Following the withdrawal, British forces under Lieutenant-Colonel George Monro claimed a victory. The French may have not been able to take the fort, but the destruction of so many boats crippled Monro's ability to sortie reconnaissance parties further up the lake to assess French and Indian movements. Coupled with the loss of the boats, manpower shortages and \\"ignorant and undisciplined\\" soldiers all made patrolling and scouting outside the protective walls of Fort William Henry quite precarious for Monro and he was unable to send out sufficient scouts.Fowler, p. 118 Throughout the spring and early summer the Indians, spurred on by French rewards of brandy, guns, ammunition and clothing, sortied on raiding parties from Fort Carillon south towards Fort William Henry, kidnapping and scalping anyone who dared venture beyond the protective walls of the fort. Although starved for information, Monro could do little to respond to the Indian raids or gain intelligence on French movements until sufficient reinforcements arrived. He also moved slowly to re-construct the buildings or boats destroyed by the French months earlier. In June reinforcements finally did arrive when Provincial and militia units from New York, New Jersey and New Hampshire were sent up from Fort Edward by General Daniel Webb. Desperate for information and now newly reinforced, Monro decided to act.Fowler, p. 119  Battle  Monro, an officer with virtually no battle experience, decided to risk a reconnaissance in force. His plan was to gather all available boats, pack them with approximately 350 men and send them north up the lake into an area controlled by an enemy he knew little about. To command this force Monro chose Colonel John Parker of the newly arrived Jersey Blues unit. It was decided to land Colonel Parker's flotilla of men on Sabbath Day Point situated approximately north of Fort William Henry on the west side of Lake George. On 20 July an advance party of three boats left for the point, with Parker's main force departing in the pre-dawn hours of 21 July. The passage of the first three boats was spotted by French scouts. On 21 July a force of approximately 450 French and Indian men under the command of Ensign de Corbiere departed Fort Carillon to intercept. The French ambushed Parker's three lead boats and while under \\"questioning\\" by Indians, the Provincials told them exactly where Parker planned to come ashore. The French trap was then set. The ambush plan was to place musket-men along the shore of the point and a flotilla of Indians in fifty canoes out of view on the opposite side of the point.Fowler, p. 120 In the early morning hours of 23 July Parker's main force approached Sabbath Day Point unaware that the French had intercepted his three lead boats and learned his plan. As Parker's men approached the shore they noticed the three boats sent out a day ahead and assumed nothing was wrong. Three decoys aided the French and Indians in springing the trap by beckoning Parker's men towards the shore. Once within range Parker's men came under a withering volley of musket fire from the soldiers and Indians hidden along the shore. At the same time the Indians in the canoes broke around the point and surrounded Parker's men. The Indians jumped into the water from their canoes and sank, capsized or captured all but two of Parker's boats. Once in the water, many of the Provincials were speared or drowned. The ensuing battle was severely one-sided as the terrified and overwhelmed soldiers surrendered almost without firing a shot. Barely 100 of Parker's men, including Parker himself, escaped the onslaught of the French and Indians. Of Parker's force of 350, nearly 160 drowned or were killed. The remainder were taken prisoner.  Aftermath  Colonel Parker, lucky to escape the onslaught, led what was left of his men through the brush and thick forest back to Fort William Henry. The victors loaded their prisoners and spoils into boats and headed north. Along the way they sang songs and indulged in the rum taken from the Provincials. Once back at Fort Carillon the Indians, drunk on rum, boiled and ate one unlucky captive. Monro paid a heavy price to learn that there was a sizeable body of French and Indians further up the lake. The French capitalized on the win and sent two forces south from Carillon, one on Lake George and one chopping through the dense forest on the west side of the lake. With the defeat on Sabbath Day Point, both bodies met little British resistance. Their objective was Fort William Henry; on the morning of 3 August the French came down the lake and glided into the view of the British. The Battle of Fort William Henry was about to begin.Fowler, p. 121  References   Bibliography  *  External links  *https://web.archive.org/web/20070324170937/http://www.sevenyearswarassociation.com/Reference/SYWChron1757.html *http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=h&p;=f&a;=i&ID;=1 *Betrayals: Fort William Henry and the massacre By Ian Kenneth Steele Category:Conflicts in 1757 Sabbath Day Point 1757 Sabbath Day Point 1757 Category:Pre-statehood history of New York (state) Sabbath Day Point 1757 Category:1757 in North America Category:1757 in New York ","title":"Battle of Sabbath Day Point"},{"id":"10688540","text":"Jumeirah Mosque () is a mosque in Dubai, Emirate of Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Dirlik's works have been translated into Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Turkish, Bulgarian, French, German and Portuguese. Positions and critiques Dirlik spoke on his approach to history and the theoretical issues of historiography in a 2002 interview. As a \\"practicing historian\\" Dirlik said, \\"I continue to practice history not just because it is a way to make a living, which is an important consideration, but because I think that there is some value and meaning to historical understanding.\\" He goes on to say that \\"I am also appalled at the arbitrary magisterial judgments on history encountered frequently in contemporary literature; a kind of licence that postmodernism seems to legitimize: since we cannot know anything, anybody can speak about everything.\\" The interview goes on to criticize the field of postcolonial studies, which he took up in such essays as \\"History Without a Center? Reflections on Eurocentrism,\\" Prasenjit Duara in 2001 replied to Dirlik's charge that diasporic scholars from the former British colonial world had used the concepts of \\"postcolonialism\\" to become embedded in Western academic \\"strongholds\\" and that they did not represent the majority of the population in their former countries. Likewise even a sympathetic review of the field objected to Dirlik's framing of post- colonial scholars as \\"agents of capital.\\" Dirlik was also critical of the \\"Beijing Consensus\\" which presented China's economic development model as an alternative ‚Äì especially for developing countries ‚Äì to the Washington Consensus. Dirlik argued that this \\"Silicon Valley model of development\\" ignores the fact that \\"the exploitation of China's labor force by foreign countries was a major part of the Chinese development.\\"Dirlik, Arif. University of Oregon. \\"Beijing Consensus: Beijing 'Gongshi.' \\" Jerry Bentley's 2005 account in the journal World History provides a cogent summary of Dirlik's critiques of the field and his own disagreement. Dirlik, he says, has leveled a \\"challenging critique\\" of the field of world history, charging that it \\"naturalizes capitalist globalization by turning it into human fate\\" and that scholarship in the field \\"perpetuates Eurocentric knowledge even as it seeks alternatives to Eurocentric explanations of the global past.\\" Bentley continues that Dirlik has identified genuine problems, but has \\"harnessed his scholarship to a political agenda.\\" Dirlik \\"overstated the problems and overgeneralized his critique,\\" falling into the \\"trap of an originary fallacy,\\" in which he \\"confuses origin with fate,\\" assuming that historical scholarship must inevitably follow lines established at the foundation.\\" Selected publications * Arif Dirlik WorldCat Authority Page. ;Books * * 1989.

This book contains a fictional interview (with true facts) between Ms. Braun and Jim Qwilleran, a main character in the story. Plot This story occurs during Pickax‚Äôs 150th anniversary celebration. Qwilleran‚Äôs barn is going to be sketched by an architectural student. The young architect is Harvey Ledfield, nephew of Nathan and Doris Ledfield. Harvey brings along his fianc√©e Clarissa Moore, who is in Journalism School. When they arrive, Harvey begins sketching but then Koko drops on his head. Clarissa breaks up with Harvey after they return Down Below, but she returns to Pickax looking for a job at The Moose County Something. She confesses to Qwilleran she never was really engaged to Harvey. As they are childless, he hopes they will support his plans. During the Pickax Now celebrations, Qwilleran attends the Ogilvie-Fugtree reunion. Two cousins go out rabbit hunting, and only one returns. Both were set to receive a large sum of money from a rich uncle. The other rabbit hunter is indeed found dead, so the first is arrested. However, he is later released because of a lack of evidence. In the meantime, the Ledfields have come down with allergies. Harvey never got Clarissa a ring, so Doris gave her one before she knew the engagement was a ruse. Clarissa wanted to give it back, but she could not get the Ledfields on the phone nor was she allowed to go in their house. Qwilleran calls the Ledfields‚Äô doctor, who says she too was considering calling in an allergy specialist. Both the Ledfields die from respiratory complications. Clarissa brings her friend Vicky to Pickax to participate in a kitten auction for charity and to watch the Labor Day Pickax Now parade. She leaves before she has a chance to speak to Qwilleran, but she leaves a letter for him. Apparently Harvey had come up to Moose County not too long ago. But the Ledfields are unwilling to give money to such a venture. Clarissa informs Harvey, Vicky and Vicky‚Äôs boyfriend about deadly mold, which she wrote a report on for journalism school, and Vicky‚Äôs boyfriend, a construction specialist, said that it could be found in the closets of old houses. Clarissa tells Vicky how Harvey became furious when the Ledfields would not fund the ski lodge even though it seemed he would be entering college and he had a fianc√©e. He even refused to go to church that morning, and Vicky suspected he had used the time to put mold in the ventilation shafts of the Ledfields' bedroom. Qwilleran shares this with the police, and Harvey is arrested. In the meantime, the Ledfields' wills is opened, revealing that the Ledfields left their collection of mounted animals to the city and funded the creation of a music center in Pickax and a museum in their old home. They also gave funds for a massive music foundation that would make the Ledfield name famous worldwide, to be set up in a city with a population of one million or more. Shortly after the mystery is solved, a tragic accident at the ill-fated Black Creek bridge takes the life of Qwill's long-time eccentric friend, Elizabeth Hart, the owner of the Grist Mill fine restaurant. In honor of her, the Black Creek Bridge is set to be repaired so that no more deaths occur. Reception Publishers Weekly called the book \\"disappointing\\".

They are found in temperate meadows and disturbed roadside verges. The scientific name probably covers a group of morphologically indistinguishable species, which would complicate their use as test species in substitution for E. albidus, a species commonly cultivated in the laboratory for toxicity tests, according to OECD.OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals 220, adopted 13 April 2004 For aquarists \\"Grindal worms\\" are treated as smaller relatives of whiteworms, but usually only grow to about 10 mm and thus are an ideal size for most small freshwater fishes, both adults and larger fry. Mrs. Morten Grindal, of Sweden, who was prominent in the development of culturing techniques for whiteworms, was apparently the first aquarist to isolate this smaller species. Grindal worms can be cultured exactly as whiteworms but are a much more adaptable species and have a greater tolerance for warmer temperatures. Maturity has been reported to occur around 16 days at 20 ¬∞C, the clitellum forming when the worms are about 3~4 mm. The generation period (cocoon to cocoon) is about a month at 20 ¬∞C. Uses Enchytraeus buchholzi/Grindal worms are cultured by aquarists as a fish food, often on a bed of ground coconut shells, or coir, with oatmeal. They are used for conditioning tropical fish before spawning, or for young fast-growing fish. In laboratory testing, Enchytraeus buchholzi were kept in an incubator at 15 ¬± 2 ¬∞C. Water loss and food were replenished if necessary during the test period. After 21 days the offspring and the surviving adults were counted. For two moisture levels (5% and 20% water content) the segment number of the surviving adults was counted. From 20% up to 40% water content Enchytraeus buchholzi showed no significant difference in reproduction. Below 20% and above 40%, the number of offspring was reduced. No juveniles were found at 5% water content, although adult survival was equal to higher moisture levels. Reproduction was decreased at 30% water content compared to 25% and 35% water content. Low soil moisture inhibited not only reproduction, but had also a negative effect on the growth of the parent generation.

It was meant to provide federal support for the prohibition efforts of individual states in the face of charges that state regulation of alcohol usurped the federal government's exclusive constitutional right to regulate interstate commerce. Text The statute reads:New York Times: \\"Webb Liquor Bill is In Force To-Day,\\" March 2, 1913, accessed July 20, 2010 :The shipment or transportation, in any manner or by any means whatsoever of any spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor of any kind from one State, Territory, or District of the United States, or place noncontiguous to, but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, into any other State, Territory, or District of the United States, or place noncontiguous to, but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, which said spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquor is intended by any person interested therein, to be received, possessed, sold, or in any manner used, either in the original package, or otherwise, in violation of any law of such State, Territory, or District of the United States, or place noncontiguous to, but subject to the jurisdiction thereof, is hereby prohibited. Enactment The law was named for its principal sponsors, Democratic Rep. Edwin Y. Webb of North Carolina and Republican Sen. William S. Kenyon of Iowa. Congress passed the legislation and sent it to the President on February 18, 1913. Ten days later, on February 28, 1913, President William Howard Taft, in the closing days of his administration, vetoed the law on constitutional grounds, believing that it delegated to the individual states the federal government's exclusive right to regulate interstate commerce. He submitted with his veto an opinion by Attorney General George W. Wickersham. The Senate overrode his veto the same day by a vote of 63 to 21,New York Times: \\"Liquor Bill Veto Rejected by Senate,\\" March 1, 1913, accessed July 20, 2010 and the House of Representatives did so by a vote of 246 to 85 on March 1, 1913. The law did not simply prohibit the transport of alcoholic beverages into \\"dry\\" states, that is, states that banned alcohol. At the time of its passage and for years afterward, states varied greatly in their regulation of alcohol. Few banned alcohol entirely and were \\"bone-dry.\\" Some allowed liquor to be ordered by mail but limited the amount per month per person or prohibited its receipt by businesses. They differed as well in their definitions of such beverages by alcohol content. The Webb‚ÄìKenyon Act established the federal government's endorsement of the right of each state to control the receipt, distribution, and consumption of alcoholic beverages within its jurisdiction.New York Times: \\"'U.S. Dry Within Ten Years'; So Say Prohibitionists After Webb-Kenyon Decision; Liquor Dealers Say It Will React in Their Favor,\\" January 14, 1917, accessed July 20, 2010 Its passage, followed shortly by the passage of an income tax, was recognized as a major progressive victory and gave added impetus to the prohibition movement's drive for a constitutional amendment to ban alcohol nationwide.Daniel Okrent, Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition (NY: Scribner, 2010), 58, 60 Constitutionality The act faced challenges in the courts and the courts differed in their consideration of its constitutionality.New York Times: \\"Kentucky Wets Win,\\" June 15, 1915, accessed July 20, 2010 Some lower courts declared complete bans on alcohol at the state level unconstitutional. The Supreme Court finally delivered an opinion of the Act on January 8, 1917 in the case of James Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co. The Court sustained the Act by a vote of 7 to 2 in a decision by Chief Justice White in which a total of 6 justices concurred. The Court also affirmed the right of each state to regulate alcohol even to the extent of banning it completely. The case was a challenge to a West Virginia statute that banned shipments even for personal consumption.New York Times: \\"Liquor Men Lose in Supreme Court,\\" January 9, 1917, accessed July 20, 2010 Congress responded to the Supreme Court decision by immediately enacting legislation to make the District of Columbia \\"bone-dry.\\"New York Times: \\"Wet and Dry Hopes Raised by Decision,\\" January 11, 1917, accessed July 20, 2010 Opponents of nationwide prohibition hoped the Supreme Court decision demonstrated that the ability of each state to exercise complete control over alcohol within its borders would make a constitutional amendment superfluous. \\"It is better,\\" said the New York Times, \\"that prohibition laws should be made effective in communities that want them than that by a Federal amendment the rule of prohibition should be extended over unwilling States.\\"New York Times: \\"State Prohibition Laws Made Effective,\\" January 10, 1917, accessed July 20, 2010 The Supreme Court added a further decision upholding the law in its next term in a case involving a North Carolina statute requiring railroads to maintain records of liquor shipments and recipients.New York Times: \\"Rules Against Right to Possess Liquor,\\" December 11, 1917, accessed July 20, 2010 Repeal of prohibition The Webb‚ÄìKenyon Act became irrelevant with the adoption of national prohibition under the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Volstead Act.

Skt \\"ga·πá·∏çi\\", \\"the trunk of a tree from the root to the beginning of the branches\\" https://www.sanskrit- lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html) is a Buddhist Mahayana Sutra of Indian origin dating roughly c. 200 to 300 CE.Osto, Douglas. The Ga·πá·∏çavy≈´ha-s≈´tra: a study of wealth, gender and power in an Indian Buddhist Narrative, 2004, pg 60 It depicts one of the world's most celebrated spiritual pilgrimages, and comprises the 39th chapter of the Avatamsaka Sutra, or Flower Ornament Scripture. In Buddhabhadra's Chinese translation of the Avatamsaka, this 39th chapter is entitled \\"Entrance into the Dharma Realm\\".Osto, pg 29 The Sutra is described as the \\"Sudhana's quest for the ultimate truth\\", as the sutra chronicles the journey of a disciple, Sudhana (\\"Excellent Riches\\"), as he encounters various teachings and Bodhisattvas until his journey reaches full circle and he awakens to teachings of the Buddha. Overview Sudhana learning from one of the fifty-two teachers along his journey toward enlightenment. Sanskrit manuscript, 11-12th century. In his quest for enlightenment, recounted in the last chapter of the Flower Ornament Scripture, Sudhana would converse with a diverse array of 52 kalyƒÅ·πáa-mittatƒÅ (wise advisors), 20 of whom are female, including an enlightened prostitute named VasumitrƒÅ, Gautama Buddha's wife and his mother, a queen, a princess and several goddesses. Male sages include a slave, a child, a physician, and a ship's captain. The antepenultimate master of Sudhana's pilgrimage is Maitreya. It is here that Sudhana encounters the Tower of Maitreya, which ‚Äî along with Indra's net ‚Äì is a most startling metaphor for the infinite: The penultimate master that Sudhana visits is the Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ Bodhisattva, the bodhisattva of great wisdom. Thus, one of the grandest of pilgrimages approaches its conclusion by revisiting where it began. The Ga·πá·∏çavy≈´ha suggests that with a subtle shift of perspective we may come to see that the enlightenment that the pilgrim so fervently sought was not only with him at every stage of his journey, but before it began as well‚Äîthat enlightenment is not something to be gained, but \\"something\\" the pilgrim never departed from. The final master that Sudhana visits is the bodhisattva Samantabhadra, who teaches him that wisdom only exists for the sake of putting it into practice; that it is only good insofar as it benefits all living beings. Samantabhadra concludes with a prayer of aspiration to buddhahood, which is recited by those who practice according to Ati≈õa's Bodhipathapradƒ´pa, the foundation of the lamrim textual traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. In a November 1, 2016 article in the Bhutanese newspaper Kuensel http://www.kuenselonline.com/hh-the-je- khenpo-presides-over-17th-moenlam-chhenmo/ mention was made of the annual Moenlam (or Monlam in Tibetan language) as performed by the Drukpa Kagyu denomination of Buddhism. During this Moenlam a prayer is said that stems from the Ga·πá·∏çavy≈´ha. The Himalayan traditions use the translation made by Shiksananda, not the earlier version of Buddhabhadra.

The waiver is presented to the participants upon registering for the weekend and paying the fees, and is also presented through a link on the registration page of the corporate Web site.

On November 7, 1997, Del Toro traveled to Sarasota, Florida, in a car registered to his grandmother, with the intention of assaulting Sheila. He stopped at a Sports Authority store to obtain camouflage clothes and a gas station for directions to the address Rocha gave. On his way to Bellush's house, Del Toro was spotted by a neighbor who memorized the license plate (this would later lead to his capture). Del Toro continued to the Sarasota home, where he broke in and saw Sheila with the quadruplets. In an interview with police before his conviction, he told them that he saw her with her children and saw how caring she was and almost didn't go through with it. He was about to leave, but Sheila noticed the door was open and then noticed him. Del Toro stated he couldn't run, so he shot Bellush in the face with a .45 caliber gun and slit her throat in full view of the quadruplets. Her body was found a few hours later by 13-year-old Stevie when she returned from school. The quadruplets had been walking around in Sheila's blood, leaving small bloody footprints all over the crime scene. Several of the quadruplets were wearing life vests, which Sheila would put on them if she had to change one child's diaper so if the other children wandered off unattended and fell into the backyard pool, they wouldn't drown. Aftermath Jose Del Toro fled to Mexico after committing the murder. He was extradited to the United States in July 1999, and pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and armed burglary charges in 2000 in Florida. Circuit Judge Paul Logan gave Del Toro two consecutive life sentences, the maximum penalty for both charges. Gonzalez pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in June 1998 in a plea bargain; he was sentenced to 19 years in prison. Rocha opted to go to trial instead and was convicted of first-degree murder in January 1999 with Gonzalez's testimony; he received a life sentence. Allen Blackthorne was convicted of federal charges of interstate conspiracy to commit murder and interstate domestic violence. He received two concurrent life sentences without the possibility of parole, starting at the Beaumont, Texas federal prison. In 2001, Blackthorne was nearly killed during an attack by a prison gang, after which he was segregated from the general prison population and eventually transferred to a Florida facility. Blackthorne died aged 59 on November 18, 2014, at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. The cause of death in the case was not released. Portrayals The books Every Breath You Take () by Ann Rule and The Truth is Stronger Than a Lie () by Khari Imo are about this case. The case inspired the episode \\"The Hired Help\\" of the series Behind Mansion Walls, presented by Investigation Discovery, and a 2002 episode of A&E;'s American Justice, titled \\"Brutal Revenge\\" (since repackaged for The Biography Channel under the series title Notorious). This case was also illustrated in a 2011 episode of the Investigation Discovery Channel series FBI: Criminal Pursuit, titled \\"Twisted Obsession\\".

He graduated from Union College in 1828 and came to Detroit, Michigan in 1831, where he was an attorney, Justice of the Peace, City Attorney, and City Recorder. In 1838, he served as Mayor of DetroitSee Farmer p. 140. after the resignation of Augustus S. Porter to run for the U.S. Senate.See Lanham p. 419. He was also an agent for the Protection Insurance Company of Hartford.See Farmer p. 873 He married Lucilla Beals October 23, 1832, but she died in 1839. He established the practice of Farnsworth & Bates with Elon Farnsworth. They were joined by Henry N. Walker in 1836, who had studied law in their office. In 1837, Farnsworth left the firm to become chancellor of the chancery court of Michigan and with the addition of Samuel T. Douglass, the firm became Bates, Walker & Douglass. The firm of Walker & Douglass continued after Bates' departure for several years until they were joined by James V. Campbell. Both Campbell and Douglass served terms on the Michigan Supreme CourtSee Moore p. 1291 and both Farnsworth and Walker served as Michigan Attorney General.See Tuttle p. 672 He married Elizabeth Gertrude (or Gilmore) Judd (1810‚Äì?) December 6, 1843. At some point he moved from Detroit to Jackson County, Michigan, where he ran unsuccessfully as a Whig Party candidate for Justice of Probate in 1844.See De Land p. 295. By July 1848 he had emigrated to the Hawaiian Islands and became a citizen of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Bates was brother-in-law of Gerrit P. Judd, a former American missionary doctor who was then a power cabinet minister. He served from August 21, 1849 to 1853 on the Privy Council of King Kamehameha III. On November 1, 1849 he became Registrar of Conveyances until August 3, 1859. Although the office of Attorney General was not officially part of the cabinet since the resignation of flamboyant but short-lived John Ricord, Bates served as lawyer for the king. Ricord had help design the executive branch and served as combined Attorney General and Registrar, or chief Notary Public. Bates was succeeded by Thomas Brown who served until 1886.

The steel wheel of a steam locomotive and other older types of rolling stock were usually fitted with a steel tire or tyre (in British English, Australian English and others) to provide a replaceable wearing element on a costly wheel. Installation Replacing a whole wheel because of a worn contact surface was expensive, so older types of railway wheels were fitted with a replaceable steel tire. The tire is a hoop of steel that is fitted around the steel wheel centre. The tire is machined with a shoulder on its outer face to locate it on the wheel centre, and a groove on the inside diameter of the flange face. The inside diameter of the tire is machined to be slightly less than the diameter of the wheel centre on which it is mounted, to give an interference fit. The tire is fitted by heating to a controlled temperature, avoiding overheating. This causes the tire to expand. The wheel centre, usually already mounted on the axle, is lowered into the tire which is flange side up. The tire cools, and the retaining ring (a shaped steel bar rolled into a hoop) is fitted into the groove. Hydraulically operated rolls swage the groove down on to the retaining ring. The tire is primarily held in place by its interference fit. The shoulder on the outside and the retaining ring also keep the tire in place if the interference fit is lost. This is most often due to severe drag braking down a gradient, or due to an error in the machining. Removal of a worn tire is by machining out the retaining ring and heating the tire to relax the interference fit. Some steam locomotive wheels had tires bolted through the rim, or with a second smaller shoulder machined on the inside face of the tire. This shoulder was severely limited in size as it had to pass over the wheel centre for assembly. Tires of different designs were fitted to wheels with wooden centers (Mansell wheels in the UK) and to various other types. The use of tires is becoming obsolete. The utilisation of traditional freight wagons was often so low that tires never needed renewal, so it was cheaper to fit a one-piece (\\"monoblock\\") wheel. Monoblock wheels are lighter and offer better integrity as there is no tire to come loose. Modern flow-line repair lines are disrupted by the inspection of the wheel centre once the tire is removed, possibly generating extra rectification work, and the need to make each tire fit its allocated wheel centre. Monoblock wheels are now more economical. Causes of damage The most usual cause of damage is drag braking on severe gradients. Because the brake blocks apply directly on the tire, it is heated up, relaxing the interference fit. It is not feasible to fit the tire with such a heavy interference as to eliminate this risk entirely, and the retaining ring will ensure that the tire can only rotate on the wheel center, maintaining its alignment. In rare instances the rotation could be so severe as to wear the retaining ring down till it breaks, which could result in derailment. Severe braking or low adhesion may stop the rotation of the wheels while the vehicle is still moving can cause a flat spot on the tire and localized heat damage to the tire material. Tires are reasonably thick, about , giving plenty of room for wear. Worn tires or tires with flats are reprofiled on a wheel lathe if there is sufficient thickness of material remaining. Non-steel railway tires Some trains, mostly metros and people movers, have rubber tires, including some lines of the Paris M√©tro, the Mexico City Metro, the Caracas Metro, the Montreal Metro, Sapporo Subway, Seattle Center Monorail, Taipei Rapid Transit System, Santiago Metro and the Uijeongbu LRT References * ISO 1005 Parts 1-9 * BS 5892 Parts 1-6 Category:Train wheels ","title":"Railway tire"},{"id":"10689062","text":"Firavitoba is a town and municipality in Sugamuxi Province, a subregion of the department of Boyac√° in Colombia. Before Spanish colonization, Firavitoba was part of the Muisca Confederation of the Chibcha people in the highlands of the Eastern Cordillera of the Colombian Andes. Firavitoba belonged to the Iraca or Suamox state which, uniquely, did not observe a hereditary leadership system but elected its ruler alternately from Firavitoba and Tobas√°, two of its many tribes. Firavitoba is distinguished by its neo-Gothic church, the third biggest in Colombia. Nuestra Se√±ora de las Nieves (Our Lady of the Snows) was built between 1873 and 1976, entirely of stone sourced from nearby Sogamoso's Pedregal district.  Etymology  The name Firavitoba derives from the Muysccubun language of the Muisca people. One etymology gives the root words as fiba (\\"air\\"),Uricoechea 1871, p.106 and faoa (\\"clouds\\").Uricoechea 1871, pp.173-174  Geography  Firavitoba is located on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, at an altitude of metres above sea level (m a.s.l.). It borders the municipalities of Paipa and Tibasosa in the north, Iza and Pesca in the south, Sogamoso in the east, and Tuta and Toca to the west. General information Firavitoba - accessed 28-04-2016 It covers an area of , in part on the plains and in part mountainous. Its highest point is the hill of Gu√°tica, at a.s.l. It is bounded by the Chiquito River, one of the tributaries of the Chicamocha River. Firavitoba is from the departmental capital of Tunja, and from the provincial capital, Sogamoso.  History  = Pre-Columbian period = The original, lakeside-dwelling inhabitants of the territory may have been the Chibchan-speaking Arhuaco people, according to Spanish archaeologist Jos√© P√©rez de Barradas. Tribal migrations had slowed and settlement had been stable in the area for some time prior to the arrival of the Spaniards. The local community had organized its social structure around a hilltop site subdivided into a number districts that provided multiple vantage points. This settlement, Gu√°tica, \\"song of the fenced the mountain\\", later became the town of Firavitoba. The Muisca, also a Chibcha people, arrived in the central highlands of the Colombian Andes, the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, in the ninth or tenth century. They came up into the mountains from the Llanos Orientales, or Eastern Plains of the Orinoqu√≠a region.Suesc√∫n 1998, p.28. The early Spanish chronicler, the bishop Lucas Fern√°ndez de Piedrahita, believed that the Muisca Confederation of the highlands originally founded its state in the eleventh or twelfth centuries, centred on Hunza, capital of the ruler Hunzah√∫a, now the city of Tunja.Suesc√∫n 1998, pp.207, 208. Some seventy years before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Altiplano region had separated into four independent Muisca states: Hunza, Bacat√°, Tundama, and Iraca or Suamox (present day Sogamoso). Each state comprised a number of tribes, which formed its primary administrative and territorial units. These tribes, brought together by cultural affinity, geographic proximity or shared military and defensive interests, organized under a common legal and political framework and sovereign leadership.Suesc√∫n 1998, p.219. Of the two principal states in the Muisca's Altiplano territory at the time of the Spanish conquest one, in its southern area with its ceremonial capital in Bacat√° (now Bogot√°), was ruled by a high priest called the zipa, and the other was in its northern area, and ruled by the zaque from Hunza.Bushnell 1993, p.6. Firavitoba was a tribe and settlement of Iraca or Suamox, the smallest of the four states, whose high priest and leader was the iraca or sogamuxi. Uniquely among the Chibcha states, it did not observe the usual hereditary leadership structure of succession by the ruler's nephew, oldest son of his oldest sister.Bushnell 1993, p.7. Instead the iraca was elected by a council comprising the caciques of four of its twenty main tribes, the Pesca, Toca, G√°meza and Busbanz√°. If the election process failed to achieve a result, the cacique (or tundama) of the Tundama tribe also voted.Suesc√∫n 1998, pp.214‚Äì217. Tradition held that the sovereign ruler was to be elected from the settlements of Firavitoba and Tobas√° alone, in strict alternation and to the exclusion of all other population centres.Suesc√∫n 1998, p.225. This custom continued until the Spanish conquest. = Spanish colonization = Six expeditions by Spanish conquistadors led to the founding of the New Kingdom of Granada over much of the territory of modern Colombia, Venezuela and Panama. It was the exploratory expedition led by Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada which rapidly overcame the Muisca states of the Altiplano and colonized the region.Avellaneda 1990, p.33.Avellaneda 1990, pp.49‚Äì50. Jim√©nez de Quesada departed on April 5, 1536 from Santa Marta, on behalf of its governor Pedro Fern√°ndez de Lugo, leading a mainly military force of some 600 land troops and several hundred sailors manning brigantines for river navigation. The third stage of the land route took them up the Cordillera Oriental of the Andes into Muisca territory. The expedition suffered heavy losses from disease, and several times stopped for periods of weeks or months to rest and regain strength along the way.Avellaneda 1990, pp.44‚Äì48. By 1537 they had explored as far as the site of the future city of Bogot√° and the beginning of the eastern plains (Llanos Orientales) of the Orinoco watershed, covering much of the Muisca's Altiplano territory, including its salt and emerald mining areas. By August 1537 they had seized the treasure of the Tunja zaque, a month later they conquered Suamox, and shortly after that killed the Bacat√° zipa and his successor.Avellaneda 1990, pp.49‚Äì50. While the chroniclers of the rapid conquest and colonization of the region did not record the wars against its inhabitants, or the mistreatment of their rulers, in great detail, archival documents held in Seville and Bogot√° trace the course of events. It is known that many caciques were tortured, the leader of Firavitoba among them.Avellaneda 1990, p.167. = New Kingdom of Granada = The 1536-1538 expedition led by Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada founded the city of Santa F√© de Bogot√° (Bogot√°) and gave the name El Nuevo Reino de Granada, the New Kingdom of Granada, to the region. The Royal Audiencia of the New Kingdom of Granada was established in Santa F√© de Bogot√° in 1549. Its governor was dependent on the Viceroyalty of Peru in Lima. In 1547, one of the soldiers of the German adventurer Nikolaus Federmann, Luis de Sanabria, had been granted administrative responsibility over the territories of Firavitoba, Cormechoque and Sichac√° in the form of an encomienda, so becoming the first encomendero over the communities there. His successor was Mart√≠n de Rojas, who assumed the role on marrying his daughter, Catalina de Sanabria y Mac√≠as, in 1577. The office passed to their son, Ger√≥nimo Donato de Rojas y Sanabria. It was inherited by his son in turn. This son, Ger√≥nimo de Rojas y Ni√±o, married Josefa de Fonseca y Alarc√≥n in 1629, but conflict quickly developed with her maternal relatives, among them Tota encomendero Pedro de Alarc√≥n. This came to a head at a gathering in Tota of local encomenderos on the occasion of the visit of Royal Audiencia judge (oidor) Juan de Valc√°rcel to the region in 1636; Ger√≥nimo de Rojas was ambushed and murdered in nearby Iza by several brothers of de Alarc√≥n. His son, Mart√≠n de Rojas y Fonseca, took over the encomienda of Firavitoba. Tunja was one of the main centres of a first cycle of gold production in the region, from 1550 to around 1620. The gold-mining workforce came essentially from the indigenous population. The municipality of Firavitoba had the status of indigenous village (village of Indians) or religious district (head of doctrine), with a chaplaincy founded in 1633 by Catalina de Rojas and Sanabria. The last encomendero of Firavitoba, Lorenzo de Rojas, gifted several large buildings on the main square of Tunja, and his own large estate (hacienda), to the Society of Jesus in 1661. Gonzalez Mora 2004, p.125, Note 38. Situated between Firavitoba and Iza, this Jesuit estate of over 300 fanegadas (1 fanegada = 6,400 m¬≤, 0.64 ha, or 1.6 acres) was known as the Hacienda La Compa√±√≠a, Firavitoba or de Sogamoso. Gonzalez Mora 2004, p.125, Note 38. = Viceroyalty of New Granada = In May 1717, the Spanish Crown established the independent Viceroyalty of New Granada, with jurisdiction over the territories of modern Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Venezuela. Its administrative centre and audiencia were in Bogot√°, which joined Lima and Mexico City as a major seat of Spanish authority in the New World. A second cycle of gold production in the region, from 1680 to 1820, was focused principally on departments of Choc√≥ and Antioquia, rather than on earlier centres such as Tunja. The original church of Firavitoba was destroyed in a disaster the details which are no longer known. It may have burnt down. It was refounded in 1718 with the name Nuestra Se√±ora de las Nieves. Until 1729, only baptismal registers exist for Firavitoba. The first recorded entry was signed by the priest Francisco Antonio Velez Ladr√≥n de Guevara. The first pastoral visit recorded in the books was made by Antonio Claudio √Ålvarez de Qui√±ones, Archbishop of Santa F√© de Bogot√°, in 1730. The Jesuits occupied the Hacienda La Compa√±ia estate in Firavitoba until their expulsion from the possessions of the Spanish crown in the Americas and the Philippines in 1767. It was then subdivided and sold, but sections of walls of the old estate remain. Gonzalez Mora 2004, p.125, Note 38. In 1781, the encomienda came to an end when Firavitoba was granted the higher status of parish (parroquia), with a mayor and a priest in residence. The indigenous inhabitants were transferred to Nobsa to serve out the remainder of their encomienda obligations, but were returned before the popular uprising against the Spanish authorities in the Viceroyalty of New Granada known as the Revolt of the Comuneros, from May through October of that year, although they lost some of their land. = Independence = Several years after the revolt and Colombian Declaration of Independence on July 20, 1810 in Santa F√© de Bogot√° came the Spanish reconquest of New Granada in 1815‚Äì1816, under General Pablo Morillo. In 1816, the priest in Firavitoba, Carlos Suarez, was imprisoned for preaching freedom. The liberation campaign of 1819 peaked with the battles of Vargas Swamp, at Paipa, very close to Firavitoba, and of Puente de Boyac√° (The Bridge of Boyaca), at which Firavitoba freedom fighter Cayetano Avella was killed. These two battles led to the full independence of New Granada and the creation of Gran Colombia in August, 1819. Gran Colombia was dissolved in 1830, with the region becoming part of the Republic of New Granada, formed in November 1831. Although several public primary schools were established in Firavitoba before 1832, during the Republican era the importance of the municipality diminished and it passed largely unremarked in national affairs. Earthquakes in 1826 and 1827 caused serious damage to the church, but the local governmental authorities did little to make repairs. In 1869, a new parish priest arrived in Firavitoba, and the situation began to improve. Father Ignacio Ram√≥n Avella proposed the building of a new and imposing church in the town, Nuestra Se√±ora de las Nieves (Our Lady of the Snows). It was to be based on the model he had brought back from Paris of a European church, and built of stone carted from the Pedregal district of Sogamoso. Construction began four years later in 1873, and was carried out under his personal direction. Deep foundations were dug and laid. When the time came for the raising of the walls, most of Firatoba's residents participated in a day-long expedition to fetch material for the scaffolding, crossing Lake Tota to the village of Bog√ºita for the timbers. = 20th century = Nuestra Se√±ora de las Nieves, Firavitoba  Nuestra Se√±ora de las Nieves  Father Ignacio Ram√≥n Avella died in 1901, and was much mourned in Firavitoba. The church was still under construction but the original model had been lost, complicating progress. Work languished until 1916, when the priest Luis Abd√©nago Zambrano arrived in Firavitoba. He commissioned a new design, from Father Hugo Orjuela, and work resumed under the direction of Gregorio G√≥mez. 1937 saw completion of the church roof, providing protection for the finished back and side walls. Construction of the facade had been postponed by order of the bishop of Tunja, Crisanto Luque S√°nchez, until the roof was in place. Work on the facade then progressed without further interruption. The north tower of the church was finished in 1946, and the south tower in 1949, completing the exterior of the church. Work then focused on the interior of the church, Luis Alberto Molano supervising installation of the central altar. Firavitoba's church was officially completed in 1976, just over one hundred years after work began. The consecration of Nuestra Se√±ora de las Nieves was performed by the Archbishop of Tunja, Augusto Trujillo Arango. It is the third largest church in Colombia, built entirely of stone in the neo-Gothic style, and is a main feature of the municipality.  Other key events  The arrival of the telegraph in Firavitoba in 1919, and of the public telephone in 1926, facilitated communication with other regions. Running water was connected to homes in 1929, and the road to Sogamoso was completed in 1933. After many interruptions, the Paipa road running through the Vargas Swamp was completed in 1951, just over twenty years after roadworks began. The Pro-Luz Company of Firavitoba was established at the beginning of 1953 to install electric lighting in the municipality, successfully implementing a project that dated back to 1936. In 1962, the national Minister of Health and other government figures came to Firavitoba for the laying of the foundation stone of the clinic, on the southwestern side of the School Concentration. It was built with the support of the American government. On December 2, 1962, the Municipal Council adopted the official flag and coat of arms of Firavitoba. The flag is green with a diagonal stripe from bottom left to top right in the yellow, blue and red of the Colombian flag. The coat of arms is a green shield with a golden cathedral representing the town through the church of Our Lady of the Snows. Two gold and green interlaced ears of wheat top the shield, the same motif repeating around its blue border to symbolize fertility of the land and agriculture in the municipality. The shield is flanked by four flags of Firavitoba, two on each side, symbolizing its patriotic citizens. In 1963, the secondary school curriculum leading to the qualification of bachiller was introduced in Firavitoba, with the first students graduating in 1973. In 1965, the sewer system was built through the streets of the town. In 1985, a proposal to pipe water from Lake Tota to the municipality was negotiated. The inhabitants of Firavitoba participated in community action to contribute 1,000 pesos towards compensation costs for the water transfer. June 1988 marked the first mayoral election in Firavitoba. Initially every two years, the election is now held every four years. The mayor's term of office begins on January 1. At the beginning of 1989, land was granted to national telecommunications company Telecom on the site of a demolished children's school north of the main square, to build local headquarters. This was intended to facilitate rollout of the municipal telephone network, a project planned since 1978. On January 19, 1995, a powerful earthquake struck the department of Boyac√°. In Firavitoba, both towers of the church of Nuestra Se√±ora de las Nieves were badly damaged. Reconstruction work began that same year and continued until 2000. The local community organized fundraising events, which included two festivals, two bazaars, and a beauty contest, and several companies and individuals also made donations. These efforts raised some 30 million pesos towards the cost of reconstruction. The total cost of work was anticipated in 1999 to be 180 million pesos. = 21st Century = In 2005, work began under government contract to surface the Firavitoba-Vargas Swamp road which, if completed, would link to Paipa and reduce travel distance to Tunja. In the same year, the mayors of Sogamoso, Iza and Firavitoba signed a contract with the Sugamuxi Consortium to repair and improve the road connecting the three municipalities, replacing an earlier contract with another consortium that had run into difficulty. The project was for the paving of the road to a width of , at a cost of over 3.5 billion pesos. In 2012, a new municipal library was purpose-built in the town. It was inaugurated by the national Ministry of Culture on December 11 of that year. Its provide a general area with bookshelves, reading tables for adults, computers, and a special zone for children, as well as bathrooms for adults and children and facilities compliant with regulatory requirements for people with disabilities. In 2015, after renovation works, a park on the site of Firavitoba's first Dominican church was inaugurated in honor of Sister Gabriela de San Mart√≠n, founder of the Dominican Community of Saint Catherine of Siena, who was born at the Jesuit Hacienda de la Compa√±√≠a on May 22, 1848. In 2017, repair work began some of Firatoba's streets, and four-lane road-widening work was completed. New rainwater drains were built, repairing damage that had been done to the old sewage system during works in 2015.  Economy  The main economic activity of Firavitoba is livestock farming for beef and dairy production. Crop growing is the second most important sector of the local economy, mainly producing potato, wheat, corn, beans, peas, and barley, with other vegetables produced on a smaller scale.

Official website G√°meza - accessed 04-05-2016  History  Before the Spanish conquest of the Muisca in the 1530s, G√°meza was inhabited first by indigenous groups during the Herrera Period and later part of the Muisca Confederation, the former country of the Muisca in the central highlands (Altiplano Cundiboyacense) of Colombia. The confederation was ruled by zaques in Hunza (present-day Tunja), zipas in Bacat√° and caciques of other villages. G√°meza was part of the reign of the iraca of Sugamuxi, currently known as Sogamoso. With the election of a new ruler of Sugamuxi, the cacique of G√°meza was consulted, together with the leaders of Busbanz√°, Toca, Boyac√° and Pesca among the nobles of Firavitoba and Tobas√≠a. In case of conflict, the ruler of Tundama would intervene. The first Europeans encountering the Muisca were the troops led by conquistador Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada in 1537. The last zaque beaten by the Spanish soldiers was Aquiminzaque whose primary wife was the daughter of the cacique of G√°meza. G√°meza was conquered and Spanish missionaries were sent to convert the indigenous people to catholicism. On November 4, 1585 G√°meza was properly founded. The name G√°meza comes from Gamza, name of the cacique of the village. G√° and za in the Chibcha language of the Muisca mean \\"serf of the Sun\\" and \\"night\\" respectively. Etymology G√°meza - accessed 04-05-2016  Geography  G√°meza is located in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes. In the area gold deposits are present and the Chicamocha River originates in G√°meza.

Grondijs was born in the Dutch East-Indies, now known as Indonesia, and via his mother was one eighth Indonesian. He spent most of his youth in the East Indies and graduated in 1896 from grammar school in Surabaya. A gifted academic, he graduated in mathematics and physics at Utrecht University in 1905 and continued his studies in philosophy and mathematics at Leiden University. In 1907 with J.D. Bierens de Haan he founded the Journal of Philosophy ' and in the 1930s he became a leading expert in Byzantology. Louis Grondijs, student at Utrecht University in 1901 Working as a teacher at the Dordrecht Technical Institute in 1914, he quit his post when the Great War broke out and secured a position as war-correspondent for the Dutch newspaper Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant. He went into neighboring Belgium where he covered the early events of the war in Aerschot, the German war crimes at Leuven as well as the siege of Antwerp. He published a book on his experiences in Belgium, The Germans in Belgium - Notes by a Dutch Eye-Witness and afterwards traveled to France, working as a war- correspondent for various international newspapers and news-magazines. For saving fifty Belgian clergymen from German execution during the Rape of Belgium period, including the rector magnificus of the famous Catholic University of Leuven, he was decorated officer in the Belgian Order of the Crown. Later in September 1915, he left for Russia at the invitation of general Aleksei Brusilov where he was allowed to accompany the Russian 8th Army as a correspondent of The Daily Telegraph. Many of his vividly written articles on warfare on the Eastern Front were published in the prestigious French newsweekly l'Illustration. He apparently respected the fighting qualities of the common Russian soldier and expressed his admiration numerous times in his articles. And although an academic by profession, he seemed to relish the adventure and excitement of war-time journalism and of warfare itself; he is said to have taken active part in combat along with his Russian hosts on many occasions. For this, he was decorated with the Imperial Russian Order of St. George, Order of St. Stanislaus, Order of St. Anna and Order of St. Vladimir. Louis Grondijs, Captain in the French Army in 1919 He was present in Petrograd during the initial February Revolution in 1917, but after the Bolshevist take-over, he left for White controlled territory where he joined counter-revolutionary armies of generals Lavr Kornilov and Mikhail Alekseev and reported on the Russian Civil War. In June 1918 he was the only western war correspondent to join the Volunteer Army in the Kuban Campaign. Oddly he appears to have found the time to obtain a doctor's degree in physics at the university of Charkov in 1917 on the thesis '. In 1918 he became an accredited war-correspondent to the French government, for which later that year he travelled to the USA, Japan and the Russian Far East. In the US he met former president Teddy Roosevelt and Tom√°≈° Masaryk who became in 1920 president of Czechoslovakia. From Japan he returned to Russia, holding the honorary rank of captain in the French Army and following and reporting on events with the French Military Mission in Siberia during the years 1918-1920. For this, he was decorated with the French L√©gion d'Honneur √° titre militaire and the Order of the Rising Sun of Japan. He married Antonie Therese Marie Thekla van Embden in 1908, and divorced her in the late 1910s. During the Russian Civil War, he married Valentine de Gontjarenko Petrenko, a concert pianist. After the definitive Bolshevist victory he returned to Europe, openly professing his anti-Bolshevist views in articles and lectures. In the early 1920s he settled in Paris working for the ' of the Sorbonne and studying history of arts and Byzantology. In 1928 he returned with his wife Valentine to The Netherlands. He once again took up the profession of academic lecturer and in 1935 became a full professor of Byzantine history and art at Utrecht University. In the 1930s he made several academic research travels to Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and was involved in archaeological excavations. Love of adventure and war must have been irresistible, for he later went to Manchuria to report on the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. He met with Chiang Kai-shek, Puyi and Thubten Ch√∂kyi Nyima the Panchen Lama. In 1936-37 he was in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, afterwards in 1939 accompanying the Hungarian army as it occupied Ruthenia, as a result of the Munich Agreement. In 1941 he obtained his second doctor's degree at the Sorbonne with the thesis '. During World War II German occupation of The Netherlands, by virtue of his anti-Bolshevist sympathies, he appears to have been asked to publish articles and give lectures praising National Socialist policies. His openly expressed appreciation of the bravery of Russian fighting-men, based upon his first-hand experiences during the Great War, did little to endear him to the occupying German and collaborating Netherlands authorities and he was dropped from favor, apparently narrowly missing incarceration because of these views. Still, his contacts with right-wing, authoritarian political movements before and during the Second World War, were well-known and as a result he experienced minor troubles after the war ended. In the end he was absolved and returned to his academic post, retiring in 1949. He passed on in 1961, at the age of 81 while practising the sport of fencing, one of his favorite pastimes.

McGhee (October 28, 1861 ‚Äì September 9, 1912) was a black civil rights activist and one of America‚Äôs first African American lawyers. McGhee, born as a slave but who later was able to achieve a substantial career as an attorney and become one of the civil rights pioneers, was a contemporary of Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois. McGhee was born in Aberdeen, Mississippi, to Abraham McGhee and Sarah Walker, who were slaves. His father, from Blount County, Tennessee, was a literate black slave who learned how to read and write without being formally educated, and later became a Baptist preacher. Abraham McGhee taught his three children, Mathew, Barclay and Fredrick, how to read and write. Abraham McGhee died in 1873 and soon Fredrick‚Äôs mother died leaving her three sons orphans. McGhee was able to attend Knoxville College in Tennessee, and graduated with a degree in law in 1885. Although he began his legal career in Chicago, McGhee settled in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he became the first black lawyer admitted to the bar in that state. With a much smaller black population from which to attract clients, McGhee primarily represented whites, gaining a reputation for competence and oratory. He also became the first African American lawyer admitted to the bar in Tennessee and Illinois. He was one of the most highly skilled criminal lawyers of the Old Northwest. In his law practice, McGhee once won a clemency from President Benjamin Harrison for a client who was a black soldier falsely accused of a crime. In 1886, he married Mattie B. Crane. The couple had one daughter. Despite his success as a criminal lawyer, he was primarily a race relations advocate. By the early 1900s, McGhee became interested in the national discussion concerning racial discrimination and social equality. In 1905, McGhee with Du Bois and others formed one of the first national civil rights organizations, the Niagara Movement, which was an attempt by more radical blacks to directly and honestly oppose the conservative actions and views of Booker T. Washington. The Niagara Movement was the forerunner of the NAACP. In September 1905, Du Bois went so far as to give McGhee full credit for creating the more radical entity, stating, \\"The honor of founding the organization belongs to F. L. McGhee, who first suggested it.\\" McGhee was very active politically. He was chosen to be a presidential elector by the Minnesota Republican party in the spring of 1892, but after protests by white Republicans, he was replaced before the start of the 1892 Republican National Convention, which was held in Minneapolis in June. McGhee remained a party member until the spring of 1893, when party bosses reneged on another political promise. Frustrated, McGhee changed his allegiance to the Democratic Party (United States), becoming one of the first nationally prominent black Democrats at a time when nearly all blacks were Republicans. McGhee converted from the Baptist denomination to Catholicism at a time when the vast majority of African Americans were Baptists. He was very active in Saint Peter Claver Church, a Roman Catholic church in St. Paul, Minnesota. McGhee died in 1912, at age 50, of pleurisy, three years after the founding of the NAACP.

Located approximately one mile west of U.S. Highway 67 and 3 miles south of U.S. Interstate 80, Pleasant Valley High School draws students from several communities in eastern Iowa Scott County, Iowa, including eastern Bettendorf, Riverdale, LeClaire and surrounding rural areas‚Äîincluding Pleasant Valley Township (for which the school district was named). Bettendorf High School, located only 5 minutes west, is their cross town rival in Bettendorf History The Pleasant Valley Township School District had formed in 1957, and two elementary schools in the tiny school district‚ÄîRiverview and Pleasant View‚Äîwere deemed too small to house a high school program. Construction on a $1.36 million junior-senior high school building, on a 40-acre site along Belmont Road at Bettendorf's northeast city limits, began in 1959, and the first day of class was September 12, 1960. The first graduating class was in 1962, with 24 seniors (there was no 1961 graduating class). Richard Klahn was the first principal, and oversaw a teaching staff that was quickly regarded as one of the finest in Iowa. (The first teaching staff had to have master's degrees or were currently working on one.) \\"The original Pleasant Valley High School boasted many modern features,\\" a history of the school, published in the 1986 Valenian (the high school yearbook), said of the then state-of-the- art features. \\"All rooms and coidors were acoustically engineered. Each room had thermostatically controlled heat with an automatically controlled fresh- filtered air supply. Colors (blue, green, gold, olive and chartreuse) were scientifically selected for balanced brightness ration and light reflectance. A two-way public address system in every room provided for paging, announcements, radio and recorded programs. A master time-keeping system automatically corrected all clocks throughout the building. Swanson and Maiwald (the Moline, Illinois-based architectural firm that designed the school) even made provisions in the gym for future additions of permanent and folding bleachers and for an electronically operated folding partiction to divide the gym area into two practice courts. Also included was a roof-top telescope over the library.\\" In 1966, the Pleasant Valley School district merged with the LeClaire and Cody school districts, meaning high school students from those districts (they had previously gone to Bettendorf) were now attending Pleasant Valley. Junior-senior high school enrollment increased to over 600 (it had been less than half that previously), and a three-phase building program was started, with additions completed in 1967, 1971 and 1974. Junior high students were moved from the high school building to the new Blackhawk Junior High in LeClaire (now Pleasant Valley Junior High) in 1970. During the mid-1970s, a proposal to renovate and move high school students to Blackhawk Junior High and repurpose the high school building as a junior high, failed. In 1984, the high school, along with the district's other four schools, were honored with the \\"Excellence in Education\\" award, in recognition of the district's high academic standards and fine teaching staff.\\"Turning the clock back on PV,\\" Valenian, pg. 18-23.

At the outbreak of the First World War, he commanded the 15th Infantry Division. Soon, he was promoted to the head of the 6th Corps and the First Army. He participated on the Gorlice‚ÄìTarn√≥w Offensive in 1915 and the countryside of Romania in 1916. In March 1917, he became Chief of the General Staff until his resignation on 3 November 1918. Early life Born into a Protestant family that was among the ancient Saxon settlers of east Transylvania, Arz was the product of a noble \\"Siebenb√ºrger\\" family.Indeed, his grandfather Martin Samuel Arz had been postmaster of Hermannstadt (today Sibiu) and was raised to the nobility in 1835 with the title \\"von Straussenburg\\" His father, Albert Arz von Strau√üenburg, served as an evangelical preacher and curate as well as a member of the House of Magnates. Schooled in Dresden and Hermannstadt, Arz graduated \\"with great achievement\\", and went on to read law at a university, during which time he volunteered for one year's service in a Hungarian Feldj√§ger battalion during 1876‚Äì1877. Early career Having successfully completed a year's military service, Arz sat and passed the reserve officers examination and went on to apply for and successfully obtain a commission as a regular officer. In 1878, he was commissioned with the rank Leutnant. Arz as a Lieutenant-Field Marshal in 1912 Attaining the rank of Oberleutnant, Arz attended the Imperial Kriegschule in Vienna, 1885‚Äì1887, where he again distinguished himself, and in 1888 he was appointed to the General Staff. Promoted to Hauptmann and assigned to a corps staff, Arz was made Adjutant to Feldzeugmeister Baron Sch√∂nfelda before returning to the General Staff in 1898, where he was to remain, with a few breaks, until 1908. Promoted next to the rank of Major, then Oberstleutnant, Arz was attached to the 2nd Corps, then commanded by Archduke Eugen, following his assignment to the General Staff. On 1 May 1902 he was promoted to Oberst and appointed to the managing bureau of the General Staff, of which department he was appointed head in May 1903. The same year, he married Stefanie Tomka von Tomkahaza und Falkusfalva, a Hungarian noblewoman, with whom he had a daughter. In 1908, Arz was again promoted, this time to the rank of Generalmajor, and was given command of the 61st Infantry Brigade. Having been steadily promoted and seen as a promising and competent officer, he received an \\"outstanding\\" evaluation from his old commander, Archduke Eugen, during 1911's fall maneuvres. 1912 saw him promoted to command a division, the 15th infantry at Miskolc. Soon afterwards Arz attained the rank of Feldmarschall-Leutnant and in 1913 was reassigned to the war ministry in Vienna to head up a section. First World War =The opening= At the outbreak of war in the Summer of 1914, Arz von Straussenburg requested a transfer to a field assignment and was again given command of the 15th infantry division,from FML von Schenk on September 2nd. which participated in the closing stages of Komar√≥w. Almost immediately thereafter, on 7 September, Arz was given command of the 6th corps, taking over from Boroeviƒá, who had been appointed to command the Third Army. In charge of the 6th Corps, he performed outstandingly and with great energy at Limanowa-Lapan√≥w, where his unit formed part of the 4th Army. At Gorlice-Tarn√≥w he was again to play an outstanding role and was in command again at Grodek-Magierow and Brest-litowsk during the summer of 1915. In September 1915, he was promoted to the rank of General der Infanterie, and having fought alongside Mackensen's 11th army he gained the respect of the Germans in his abilities as a commander. =The Romanian Campaign= With the threatened entry of Romania into the war on the Allied side, Arz was reassigned from the 6th Corps and appointed to command the newly reorganised 1st Army on 16 August 1916. Arriving at Kolozsv√°r (today Cluj-Napoca, Romania), where forces were being marshalled to repel an expected Romanian advance into Transylvania, he stated \\"I am an Army Commander without an Army\\". Indeed, on the Romanian declaration of war on 27 August, the 1st 'Army' comprised a mere 10,000 men (half a division). A slow Romanian advance combined with hysterical outcry from Budapest led to the 1st Army being considerably and rapidly strengthened to drive back the challenge from the south. Disposition of Romanian forces in Austria-Hungary, August 1916 Romanian forces crossed the frontier on 28 August 1916 with six separate forces pushing through the six Carpathian passes to converge on Brass√≥ (today Bra≈üov, Romania). By 4 September they had succeeded in pushing nearly as far as Sepsiszentgy√∂rgy in the Sz√©kely territories. In order to fend off these six separate invasions, Arz, now fighting on his home turf, ordered the 71st Infantry Division and 141st and 142nd Brigades to the sector. Simultaneously, the Romanian North Army sought to advance along the entire Moldavian front in the Eastern Carpathians, although in fact this amounted to an advance in the northern sector, where the Russian 9th Army was best placed to aid the advance. To counter this strike, Arz deployed the 16th, 19th and elements of the 61st divisions. In cooperation with the German 9th Army, the Romanian invasion was repelled and its forces were thrown back across the border within eight weeks, leading to Arz receiving the respect and appreciation of the new Austro-Hungarian emperor, Karl I. Other commanders also hailed his achievements during the campaign, with Conrad writing that he had \\"proved to be an energetic resolute leader in the most difficult situations...\\" and Boroeviƒá stating that Arz was an \\"Honourable, noble character....outstanding general.\\" Arz was to remain in charge of the 1st Army until February 1917, after major operations in Romania ended, with help from Falkenhayn 9th German Army and from the German Army of the Danube under Mackensen. =Chief of General Staff= Arz von Strau√üenburg's coat of arms, granted in 1918 Karl I of Austria succeeded Franz Joseph as Emperor on 21 November 1916, bringing with him a wave of change across the upper echelons of the government and military command. One casualty of these changes was Conrad, with Karl reported as \\"not wanting a genius to command his armies\\",According to historian Martin Gilbert but following on from the experience of the supremely gifted but often unsuccessful Conrad, rather someone who was just capable. Arz was acquainted with the emperor; not only was he a capable commander of troops, but he also possessed a conciliatory manner which did not make the Emperor feel he was being patronised during discussions on military matters, as was the case with other commanders. Unlike Conrad, Arz was not overtly political, was wholly committed to the Central Powers, and had full faith in the Emperor. Once appointed in March 1917, Arz made every effort to comply with the Emperor's wishes, but unlike his predecessor he acted as a personal advisor to the Emperor on army matters, rather than as a driver of his own strategy, which had been Conrad's hallmark. His tenure at the head of the army saw increasing German control over Austro-Hungarian forces and reduced independence of action, but also a number of notable victories in the spring and summer of 1917, including the clearing of Galicia and the Bukovina, as well as the breakthrough at Flitsch Tolmein and the great victory at Caporetto later in the year. Ludendorff (left) at Army Headquarters in Baden bei Wien, 1917 Promoted to the rank of Generaloberst on 26 February 1918, and also raised to the nobility early the same year, Arz was ultimately responsible for planning the invasion of Italy which was to take place during the summer of 1918, with Russia now knocked out of the war and a good number of experienced forces at his disposal. While planning was underway, both Conrad and Boroeviƒá demanded to lead the offensive, and neither Arz nor the AOK was able to make a decisive decision. Instead a compromise suggested by the Emperor was adopted, with their forces divided and sent to attack Italian positions on the front from two different directions. This resulted in the utter failure of the offensive at the Piave River in June 1918. Arz took full responsibility for the failure of the massive invasion of Italy and tendered his resignation, but the Emperor refused to accept it, even after Generaloberst Sch√∂nburg-Hartenstein had said to the Emperor's face that the army had lost all confidence in Arz. By late October 1918, Arz could see that ultimate defeat for the Imperial forces was inevitable. He had drawn up plans for an orderly troop withdrawal in the event of an armistice, so as to prevent unnecessary further bloodshed. An armistice with Italy was concluded on 3 November 1918 and was to come into effect 36 hours later, during which time thousands of Imperial troops were captured while believing themselves to be at peace, due to poor communication from Army High Command. =End of the war= During the night of 2‚Äì3 November 1918, the Emperor relinquished command of the armed forces. In a handwritten note which can still be found in the Vienna war archives, he wrote: Not wanting responsibility for handling the armistice, Arz declined the appointment, and K√∂vess took up appointment as commander-in-chief instead. Arz however undertook the position de facto until Field Marshal K√∂vess could take up his office. After the war General Arz von Strau√üenberg's obituary, 1935 After the collapse, Arz moved to in Vienna. He was granted a civil list pension of 20 000 Krone, but because of the growing inflation and anyway being not wealthy he had soon a very bad financial situation. Moreover, he became a scapegoat by the public opinion since next to the resigned King the Chief of the General Staff was made responsible for the consequences of the armistice and the defeat of the Battle of Piave. The newly established First Austrian Republic in spite of a new law accepted on 19 December 1918 conducted an infringement procedure against him regarding the Battle of Piave, however it ended without any result. With Transylvania and the Bukovina awarded to Romania after the war, he became a Romanian citizen but he refused to return to his home in a country in the defeat of which he had played a significant role only a few years earlier, having expected of possible retaliation. Despite, since January 1921 the Romanian state granted his pension until 1923 when because of the intervention of Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu the Romanian legislation voted a new law which denied the pension to those former Imperial and Royal military personnel officially resident in Transylvania, Banat and Bukovina who were not living in Romania. As living in poverty, he applied - as well in the name of 72 fellow officer - to the Hungarian Prime Istv√°n Bethlen, who denied his submission. He survived on stipends from a support fund organized by former Imperial and Royal comrades to help officers in such situations. In 1924 he was publishing his memoirs. In 1926, the Hungarian Government granted him a pension - ex post facto from 1 November 1925 -, after this the former support fund was transformed to the \\"Funds of the former General Staff\\". Since 1931, the Hungarian Parliament put a condition to all pensioner to be habitually residing in Budapest, in 1932, he moved officially to the city, however he did not check out from Vienna a continued to stay there recurrently. He applied and was granted Hungarian citizenship in 1933. In 1935, Arz wrote of his experiences during the war. His work, unlike those of many of his contemporaries, contained no element of self-justification or political statement. On 1 July 1935, during a visit to Budapest to collect his pension, he suffered a heart attack and died. He was buried with the highest military honours at the Kerepesi cemetery in Budapest.

Etymology Paipa ‚Äì Excelsio.net  History  Before the Spanish conquest in the 1530s, Paipa was inhabited by the Muisca people. The loose Muisca Confederation comprised different rulers; the cacique of Paipa was loyal to the Tundama of Tundama. Conquistador Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada visited Paipa in 1539 in his search for the Sun Temple. Modern Paipa was founded on February 19, 1602, by Lu√≠s Enr√≠quez. Paipa's first building was the church, built where the cathedral stands today, with clay tile, walls, and stone foundations. Initially, it served as a headquarters for police and justice services, and also for tax collection in Paipa and surrounding villages. On November 4, 1755, Paipa was designated as a Corregimiento, and Don Ignacio de Caicedo was named as first Corregidor. In 1758 he appointed Juan Avellaneda, Miguel Rodriguez and Esteban Lara as the first mayor of Paipa. The municipality boundaries of Paipa were demarcated in 1778. The first event that led to Paipa's reputation as a tourist city was the arrival of specialists in 1825 to analyze the local mineral waters. Tourist activity began to pick up after 1852 when the central government sent a natural resources committee headed by General Agust√≠n Codazzi. The construction of the current cathedral in Jaime Rook park began in 1906 and was finished in 1920. The first passenger trains arrived from Bogota in late 1930 and early 1931. Mineral water pools and spas were built in 1938, launching the local tourist industry, which was reinforced by the construction of Lake Sochagota in 1955. In 1960, the Departmental Assembly declared Paipa a \\"tourist capital.\\" The construction of the first local coal-fired power-plant in 1953 led to an influx of population from elsewhere in the country.Sochagota power plant Some of Paipa's historical architecture has been lost as the city has grown, and the traditional colonial main square has given way to modern buildings. Paipa inaugurated the monument to the Lancers at the Pantano de Vargas, and the now forgotten monument to Innocent Chinc√° on North Central Avenue. In this decade, the hospitality industry around the lake began to develop with the first Sochagota Springs Hotel. Before these buildings and municipal swimming pools were built, the only opportunity for residents and tourists to bathe in the hot springs was at a Victorian hotel located in urban Paipa. New urban public venues for music have recently been constructed, such as Concha Ac√∫stica \\"Valent√≠n Garcia\\", a sports and cultural complex built in 1990. By 1995 Paipa, like other neighboring cities across Colombia, began to experience urban decay due to national policies seeking to quickly industrialize and urbanize Colombia. In response to this, new housing developments are under construction in the north side of the city.  Economy  Paipa's main economic activities are tourism and agriculture, with livestock and dairy farms as well as farms producing oats, barley, maize, wheat, and potatoes. The coal-fired TermoPaipa power plant serves the entire region. The city is served by Juan Jos√© Rond√≥n Airport.

The chief reason for tire replacement is friction from moving contact with road surfaces, causing the tread on the outer perimeter of tires to eventually wear away. When the tread depth becomes too shallow (less than 4/32 in, or 3.2 mm), the tire is worn out and should be replaced. The same wheels can usually be used throughout the lifetime of the car. Other problems encountered in tire maintenance include: *Uneven or accelerated tire wear: can be caused by under- inflation, overloading or poor wheel alignment. *Increased tread wear on only one side of a tire: often a sign of poor wheel alignment. *Tread worn away completely: especially when the wear on the outer rubber exposes the reinforcing threads within, the tire is said to be bald and must be replaced as soon as possible. Sometimes tires with worn tread are recapped, i.e. a new layer of rubber with grooves is bonded onto the outer perimeter of a worn tire. Since this bonding may occasionally come loose, new tires are considered superior to recapped ones. This tire has been punctured by a screw. Sometimes a pneumatic tire gets a hole or a leak through which the air inside leaks out resulting in a flat tire, a condition which must be fixed before the car can be driven safely. Spare tires Vehicles typically carry a spare tire, already mounted on a wheel rim, to be used in the event of a flat tire or blowout. Spare tires (sometimes called \\"doughnuts\\") for modern cars are smaller than regular tires (to save trunk space, weight and cost) and should not be used to drive very far before replacement with a full-size tire. A few vehicle models use conventional size spare tires. Jacks and wrenches for emergency replacement of a flat tire with a spare are included with a new car. Not included, but available separately, are hand or foot pumps for filling a tire with air by the vehicle owner. Cans of pressurized air can sometimes be bought separately for convenient emergency refill of a tire. Some cars and trucks are equipped with run flat tires that may be driven with a puncture over a distance of 80 km to 100 km. This eliminates the need for an immediate stop and tire change or calling for roadside assistance. =Racing tires= Tires have more traction when they are bald, because there is more surface area making contact with the road. The reason regular tires have treads is to avoid hydroplaning when the surface of the road is wet. Therefore racing cars competing in dry conditions characteristically use untreaded tyres, often known as slicks. For example stock cars driven on professionally maintained NASCAR tracks use tires without treads, and with a thicker layer of rubber. Rotation Front tires, especially on front wheel drive vehicles, have a tendency to wear out more quickly than rear tires. Routine maintenance including tire rotation (exchanging the front and rear tires with each other) is often done periodically to facilitate uniform tire wear. Inflation (adding air) There are simple hand-held tire-pressure gauges which can be temporarily attached to the valve stem to check a tire's interior air pressure. This measurement of tire inflation pressure should be made at least once a month. Accurate readings can only be obtained when the tires are 'cold' - that is at least three hours after the vehicle has been driven or driven less than 1/2 mile since cold - tire pressures will not then be higher because of operating heat. The recommended inflation pressure is found in the owner's manual and on the vehicle's tire placard. Because of slow air leaks, changes in the weather and ambient temperature or other conditions, tire pressure will occasionally have to be corrected via the valve stem with compressed air which is often available at service stations. Under-inflation of tires can cause premature and uneven tire wear, excess fuel usage, and carries an increased risk of explosive failure (blowout) especially after prolonged high speed operation at high temperatures. Overall, these factors decrease the life of a tire by up to 20%. Many vehicles have tire pressure monitoring systems; older cars are usually equipped with indirect monitoring systems while later cars are typically equipped with direct tire pressure monitoring systems. Tire Safety It is extremely important for owners to have an understanding of what is safe and what is not when it comes to their tires. The three major areas to keep an eye on is the tread, sidewall, and air pressure of the tire. Having the correct air pressure in your vehicle's tires lets your vehicle perform in the most efficient way possible. When objects such as a screw or nail puncture a tire, it creates a small leak in the tire. This leads to under-inflation of the tire. When a tire is under-inflated, it causes the inside of the tire to heat up. This heat compromises the internal structure of the tire which can lead to a blowout. When a tire is over-inflated, it wears the tread down faster, and becomes more prone to catching nails or screws in the tire. The best way to check tire maintenance is to check the air pressure, because that will lead you to whatever problem your tire might have. There are several factors that may cause quicker tire wear, among them there are heavy braking and fast cornering, constant heavy cargo transportation and rough roads, improper pressure (under- or overinflation) or improper maintenance. That's why for the older vehicles, that do not come equipped with TPMS sensors, it is highly recommended to check tire pressure at least once a month (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommendation).

This rotates the cylinder and fires the weapon, allowing for the rapid firing of single-action revolvers. This technique is used extensively in fast draw exhibitions. Slip hammering is a revolver shooting technique in which one hand holds the trigger and the other hits the hammer singularly or repeatedly while remaining in constant contact with either the revolver or the support hand. This allows for greater control of the firearm than fanning. The idea (as spread by old western films) that people in the \\"Old West\\" fanned their hammers in actual firefights with any regularity is considered a caricature. It was done in shooting shows (where trick marksmen entertained crowds with shooting tricks) and by many a curious target-practicer. It was probably not common in actual firefights, because it does not lend itself to most real-life tactical situations, accuracy, or the use of cover. One longtime firearms instructor, George L. Tooley,. said: \\"Fanning is hard on the revolver, in addition to being inaccurate, and is not recommended\\". A slip gun is a revolver which has been modified to disconnect the trigger from the hammer, so as to cause it to fire by pulling back and releasing the hammer. Often the hammer spur is lowered, so the gun may be fired by wiping one's finger across the hammer. The only difference from fanning is that only one hand is needed, because in fanning one hand holds the gun and pulls back the trigger while the other hand knocks back the hammer repeatedly. Slip shooting is a little slower than fanning, but more accurate and practical since only one hand is needed. Slip guns were used for various types of rapid trick shooting in which the ability to instinctively rapid fire was crucial. Thumbing has been used to refer to a similar action as fanning except instead of using the opposite hand to pull the hammer while the trigger is depressed, the thumb of the gun hand is used. This would be necessary if firing paired revolvers.2011, Tactical Shooting, p. 14 References Bibliography * Category:Firearm techniques Category:Shooting sports ","title":"Fanning (firearms)"},{"id":"10689305","text":"The Rwanda Davis Cup team represents Rwanda in Davis Cup tennis competition and are governed by the F√©d√©ration Rwandaise de Tennis.

At any given time there are between 150 and 170 children, within the foster care system, who are ready for adoption. =Placement of foster children= DCF must take reasonable efforts to reunify parents and children unless a court has decreed otherwise. The changing nature of adoption Traditionally, adoption could not proceed unless the parental rights of both parents were first terminated.In re Theresa S., 196 Conn. 18, 30, 491 A. 2d 355 (1985). However, this is no longer always the case. In some instances, birth parents and legal parents have entered into an open adoption agreement, also known as \\"cooperative postadoption agreements.\\"Conn. Gen. Stat. ¬ß 45a-715 (2007) Either or both birth parents and an intended adoptive parent may enter into a cooperative postadoption agreement regarding communication or contact between either or both birth parents and the adopted child. Such an agreement may be entered into if: > (1) The child is in the custody of the Department of Children and Families; > (2) an order terminating parental rights has not yet been entered; and (3) > either or both birth parents agree to a voluntary termination of parental > rights, including an agreement in a case which began as an involuntary > termination of parental rights.

AISSF was formed in 1943.The Minority Rights Group, \\"The Sikhs\\", (London, 1984), p. 14. as the youth wing of the Akali Dal, which is a Sikh political party in the Indian Punjab. Origin Before the federation came into being, Sikh youths were organized into local Bhujangi Sabhas in schools and colleges across the Punjab region that promoted Sikh values, heritage and social service. The actual origin of the Sikh Student Federation can be traced back to \\"Khalsa clubs\\" established in 1888. The club came to be known as the Sikh Naujawan' Association, whose first president was Harnam Singh. Although small in size and activity, the association published the Khalsa Naujawan' Magazine and sponsored work on religious and social projects. Sikh youths were an integral part of organizations such as the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee, Shiromani Akali Dal and the All India Students Federation. Foundation The All India Sikh Students Federation was formed as a students' organisation committed to the political representation of Sikhs. The motivation for a distinct organisation for Sikhs came from the heightening communal and political tensions between the Hindu and Muslim communities. In 1937, a large group of Muslim students split from the Marxist All India Students Federation to form the All India Muslim Students Federation, which became the youth arm of the Muslim League and the Pakistan movement. Seeking to protect Sikh political rights and representation, organisations such as the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee sponsored the founding of the All India Sikh Students Federation in 1944. It was headquartered in Lyallpur (Faislabad, now in Pakistan) and its organisation spread across colleges and universities in Punjab and northern India. Following the partition of India in 1947, the organisation moved its headquarters to Amritsar in Indian Punjab. Ranbir Singh Sodhi was the co-founder member of the organisation. After Partition During the communal riots and mass migrations at the time of India's partition, the AISSF helped organise relief and rehabilitation camps for Hindu and Sikh refugees arriving in India from Pakistan. In independent India, the AISSF became closely linked as the youth arm of the Akali Dal. The federation would expand its organisation across India and become one of the nation's leading student political organisations. It would also help build support and lead the Sikh political demand for the establishment of a Sikh- majority state within the Indian union. As the agitation reached its peak in the mid-1960s, the federation helped organise student marches and rallies to increase pressure on the Indian government. Daljeet Singh Bittu was elected at president of SSF. Shaheed Dr Gurnam Singh Buttar MBBS, become the convener of Sikh Student Federation, when Manjit Singh and other mislead movement. Panthic committee made his appointment, his work was so much appreciated all over Punjab, he was such a humble person who led the guerrilla movement, travelling on his bicycle. Shaheed Dr Gurnam Singh Buttar of Sikh Students Federation was one of many brave Sikhs who gave up their well paid Government jobs in protest of Operation Bluestar and the atrocities being carried out on Sikhs all over Hindustan. On 23 December, at the Shaheedi Jorh Mela at Fatehgarh Sahib, where Akali leaders Parkash Badal, Tohra, chandumanjra were present and Sangat not even interested in their speeches. Dr Gurnam Singh and fellow Singhs took over the Akali‚Äôs stage and presented the resolution of Khalistan to the sangat. Dr Gurnam Singh addressed the sangat, and explained why there was now the need for the creation of a Sikh homeland, Khalistan. Upon hearing Dr Gurnam Singhs speech, the entire Sikh sangat raised their hands in support of this resolution. Total 12 resolutions passed on that day. This was first and last time in the history of the Sikh movement where Akalis raised their hands in front of Sangat in favour of all resolutions because they were pressured by Doctor G. S. Buttar. On April 1987, at a conference held at Sri Darbar Sahib, Dr Gurnam Singh publicly resigned from his post of junior medical officer at Qadian Civil Hospital. Resigning from his government job, Dr Gurnam Singh stated that the Khalsa is now my government, and the creation of Khalistan is my occupation, and my retirement will come in the form of Shaheedi. After Operation Blue Star in June 1984, the organization temporarily removed the words \\"All India\\" from its name, and was known as Sikh Students Federation (SSF) for some time.  Current Leadership Karnail Singh Peer Mohammad was the president of All India Sikhs Students Federation since 19 January 1995. He resigned from his designation last year , citing the need to bring young leaders forward for betterment of sikh panth and its values.

Part 1 was 4 hours in length with one interval of 15 minutes. Part 2 was 4¬Ω hours in length with two intervals of 12 minutes. It was originally presented onstage over two evenings, or in its entirety from early afternoon with a dinner break. Later it was presented on television over four evenings. The opening night was on 5 June 1980. The show ran for an 8-week season at the Aldwych Theatre, playing Part 1 on some nights and Part 2 on others with both parts playing together on matin√©e and evening performances. It was revived for two further 8-week runs at the Aldwych in the autumn season of 1980 and the spring season of 1981 before being filmed for Primetime TV at the Old Vic Theatre and transferring to Broadway for the autumn season of 1981. A further revival with a substantially different cast played at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford and toured to Los Angeles and Broadway in 1985. The play was adapted by David Edgar from the Charles Dickens novel The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby. Directed by John Caird and Trevor Nunn, the music and lyrics were from Stephen Oliver and the set design was by John Napier and Dermot Hayes. It transferred to the Plymouth Theatre on Broadway, initially opening 4 October 1981 and running until 3 January 1982. Revivals of the original production were produced in 1986 (which returned to USA for a Broadway run and national tour) and a truncated version from 2006 to 2008. The original London production is documented in Freeman, John, The Greatest Shows on Earth: World Theatre from Peter Brook to the Sydney Olympics. Libri: Oxford . Productions The original London cast included Roger Rees as Nicholas, David Threlfall as Smike, Ben Kingsley as Squeers, Bob Peck as John Browdie and Sir Mulberry Hawk, John Woodvine as Ralph Nickleby, Susan Littler as Kate, Edward Petherbridge as Newman Noggs, Timothy Spall as Young Wackford and Mr. Folair, John McEnery as Mr. Mantalini, William the Waiter and Mr. Snevellicci, Graham Crowden as Mr. Vincent Crummles, and Suzanne Bertish as Fanny Squeers, Peg Sliderskew and Miss Snevellicci, among many others. All actors apart from Rees played multiple roles. Some parts were recast in November 1980, with Fulton Mackay playing Squeers, Emily Richard taking the role of Kate Nickleby and Christopher Benjamin as Crummles. Fulton Mackay and Timothy Spall had left the company by the time the production was filmed and were replaced by Alun Armstrong and Ian McNeice respectively. When the Aldwych production closed in the summer of 1981 the set was moved to the Old Vic Theatre and the work performed for a four-part mini-series by Channel 4 and Mobil Showcase Theatre.,Price, Richard (2004): How the TV production happened Sleeve insert, Metrodome DVD of the production which was telecast in the US in January 1983.

An Australian production played at the Theatre Royal in Sydney from December 1983 to March 1984, and later in Melbourne and Adelaide from December 1984 to March 1985. It featured John Howard as Nicholas and Tony Taylor as Smike. The production was revived for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, in January 1986. A second Broadway production ran from 24 August 1986 to 12 October 1986 at the Broadhurst Theatre and was nominated for the 1987 Tony Award for Best Revival. Despite the play's success, its length and the size of the cast required means that it is seldom revived, although in 2006 Edgar prepared a shorter version for a production at the Chichester Festival, which transferred in December 2007 and January 2008 to the Gielgud Theatre in the West End. The production, directed by Philip Franks and Jonathan Church went on to perform at the Prince of Wales Theatre in Toronto, Canada.

Frank Rich in New York Times reported dull passages piling up as \\"dead weight\\", while John Simon in the New York Magazine felt that the work was a \\"middlebrow enterprise\\" doing \\"scant justice\\" to the novel. In contrast Mel Gussow, again in The New York Times, noted that \\"Nicholas Nickleby remains true to Dickens ‚Äì many of the lines are taken directly from the novel, dialogue as well as narration ‚Äì and to first principles of theater\\" when describing the RSC's recast production in 1986. Playwright and reviewer Thomas Hischak, writing in retrospect about the 1981‚Äì82 New York season, judged the production as the \\"centerpiece of the season...a theatrical experience of a lifetime\\" and in London Bernard Levin of The Times found \\"a ceaselessly entertaining...dramatic triumph\\" and despaired of the cavils of his fellow critics. He concluded: \\"‚Ä¶we come out not merely delighted but strengthened, not just entertained but uplifted, not only affected but changed.\\" Theme Edgar's writing for the stage is avowedly political and his treatment of Dickens's novel, with its descriptions of poverty and as its central subject matter the wickedness of money-broker Ralph Nickleby, sought to draw parallels between the social conditions of 1830s Britain with what he saw as the growing political climate of selfishness in the 1980s. However, some critics felt that the RSC's ebullient staging, the necessary happy ending (brought about by benevolent capitalism as represented by the Cheeryble brothers) and even the huge commercial success of the play itself diminished the impact of Edgar's message.

Clans frequently control certain government departments, though there is fluidity between clan loyalty and membership in government agencies.Changes in Uzbekistan's Military Policy after the Andijan Events Central Asia-Caucasus Institute and Silk Road Studies Program The people of Central Asia self-identified by their clans prior to Russian expansion in the 19th century. After the fall of the USSR, the informal agreements between the clans were the only means with which to stabilize the new Republics. Ethnic identity did not come into play until as late as the 1980s during glasnost.Coping With Independence: Expanding Factors of Conflict in the Ferghana Valley Indiana University The influence of the clans in the contemporary history of Central Asia is derived from the enormous importance that these have held in the past. The weaker states of Central Asia have relied on the social salience of clans to secure their own legitimacy through pacts and informal agreements. These pacts guarantee that the clans have informal access to power and resources and have allowed for the clans to become central actors in post-Soviet politics  History  Whereas Czarist colonialism had generally left Central Asia‚Äôs clans alone, Lenin declared in 1918 that the Bolsheviks would modernize the region and make its peoples into ‚ÄúSoviet nations.‚Äù But the vast communist bureaucracy of the Soviet party-state often failed to provide the social and economic goods it promised, and Soviet- forged identities (whether ethnonational or communist) put down only the shallowest of roots in Central Asia. Ironically, the Soviet institutions designed to destroy clans actually wound up making them stronger. The collectivization and ‚Äúnationalities‚Äù policies of the 1920s and 1930s were meant to modernize clans out of existence by turning wandering herdspeople into sedentary Soviet subjects and overwhelming old clan affiliations with new and larger ‚Äúnational‚Äù identities such as Kyrgyz, Turkmen, or Kazakh. However, clan members adapted and survived. They also learned to use Soviet affirmative-action policies for titular nationalities as channels for promoting kinfolk within the Soviet system. During the three decades under Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev, moreover, Moscow intervened relatively little in Central Asia‚Äôs republic-level politics, and both larger and smaller clans were able to maintain their networks with resources from the Soviet state. After Brezhnev‚Äôs death in 1982, the decline of the Soviet regime brought new instability to Central Asia. From 1984 to 1988, Moscow staged massive purges of the dominant clans in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Mikhail Gorbachev installed a large ethnically Russian cadre from Moscow in most positions of economic and political power. All told, his efforts to shake up the traditional system of power resulted in the imprisonment of an estimated 30,000 Central Asian leaders. But the deeper trend unleashed by Gorbachev‚Äôs perestroika eroded the power of the party-state. Clans reasserted themselves, seizing opportunities to coordinate against Moscow and show that they would no longer remain quiet under its heavy hand. In Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, clan elites brokered informal pacts to reclaim power. They used the ethnic unrest and riots of 1989‚Äì90 to delegitimize Gorbachev‚Äôs appointees and put forward their own candidates for the high post of republic first secretary, which in a nutshell is how both Akayev and Karimov first rose to power.  Clan identity  The clan is an informal identity network based on kinship ties and is common in semimodern societies. In such societies identities embedded in informal networks such as clans are stronger than formally institutionalised ethnonational and religious identities. Where clan networks are powerful social actors, they deter ethnonational or religious conflict and foster social stability. Also, where clans are such powerful social actors, they play a role in the elite-level politics of transition, negotiation, and conflict as well. Unlike clientelism, clans are entire webs or networks of relations, horizontal and vertical, which remain bound by identity bonds as the economic necessity of patronage rises and falls. Although often regionally based, since localism helps maintain ties, clans depend upon the genealogical or kinship relationship, which supersedes migration, language or religion. Clans include both elite and non-elite members, at different levels of society and state. Clan elites are those with power, and often money, who through birth and accomplishment have status and prominence within the clan. Clan elites can be regional governors and kolkhoz chairmen, if the clan is powerful, or simply village elders in a less powerful clan. In either case, elites are normatively and rationally bound to the well-being of their clan network. They provide political, social, and economic opportunities to their network and rely on its loyalty and respect to maintain their status. The particularistic ties and repeated interactions that characterise clans build trust and a sense of reciprocity, enabling the people involved to make contracts that extend over time. The informal ties and networks of clan life reduce the high transaction costs of making deals in an environment where impersonal institutions are weak or absent and stable expectations are hard to form. Clans in fact serve as an alternative to formal market institutions and official bureaucracies. According to academics, the size of the clans may vary anywhere between 2,000 and 20,000 individuals per group. While the elder‚Äôs council still governs the clan in rural areas, in urban settings this last is flanked by the √©lite. The √©lite need the support of their network in order to maintain their status, protect their group and obtain gains within the political and economic system. The non-√©lite need the senior clan members in order to find work, have access to scholastic institutions, do business at the bazaar, obtain a loan or procure goods. Data from three Central Asian countries-Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan-suggest that clan identity is more salient than ethnonationality and religion and is the critical variable in understanding stability and conflict. Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Kyrgyz generally refer to either their historic tribe or clan. Kyrgyz use the traditional word avlod, as well as the Russian term rod or klan. They both refer to a clan name, which defines their kin-based network, located in a village or cluster of villages and collectives. In addition to blood, inhabitants are bound by extensive marital ties and thus are fictively members of the same clan. There are three \\"wings\\", or groups of clans, that control the Government of Kyrgyzstan: the Ong or \\"right\\", the Sol or \\"left\\", and the Ichkilik. *There are seven clans in Sol, which is based in northern and western Kyrgyzstan, including the Sarybagysh clan, and the Buguu clan which controlled the Kirgiz SSR until the Great Purge of the 1930s. Kyrgyz political leaders have come from the Sarybagysh clan since the rule of Joseph Stalin. In 1990 the clan used its influence to ensure Askar Akayev became the Secretary of the Kyrgyz Communist Party instead of southerner Absamat Masaliyev. Until the Tulip Revolution of 2005 the Sarybagysh clan had control over the ministries of finance, internal affairs, foreign affairs, state security and the presidential staff.Kyrgyzstan's unrest linked to clan rivalries EurasiaNet *The Ong group consists of one clan, the Adygine, based in the south. *The Ichkilik is also a southern grouping, but has non-ethnic Kyrgyz members. Uzbekistan Uzbeks often associate klan with the mafia and are thus reluctant to refer to their local network as a clan. Uzbeks speak of their rod (the less charged Russian term), urug, or avlod. They consider not only their village, in which most inhabitants are somehow related by blood or fictive kinship, but usually several neighbouring villages, linked by marital alliances, to be part of that clan. The most powerful clan in Uzbekistan is the Samarkand clan, which has traditionally controlled the Interior Ministry; Uzbek President Islam Karimov was a member of the Samarkand clan, which is based in Samarkand, Bukhara, Dzhizak and Navoi, and is allied with the weaker Jizak clan. The Tashkent clan, which controls the National Security Service (SNB), is allied with the Ferghana clan (sometimes considered to be the same clan), and the Khorezm clan which is based in Khorezm and southern Karakalpakistan. The Tashkent clan is based in Tashkent and in Ferghana, Andijan and Namangan through its alliance. Asia TimesMilitant Islam in Central Asia: The Case of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan University of California, Berkeley  Tajikistan  Detailed data on clan identity in Tajikistan is lacking. However, Tajiks also use the term klan. The Tajik regime has publicly denounced the political influence of clans. Clan divisions, however, frequently appear at the regional and subregional lev- els, where the Soviet regime transplanted entire Garmi, Pamiri, and Badakhshani clan villages to south-central Tajikistan in the 1950s and 1960s. Tajikistan was dragged into a bloody civil war over the failure of a pact between the clans. Another pact ended the conflict and, with the support of Russia, the country has been able to establish a new rule. A minority clan presently holds power but depends entirely on Russian support.  Clan politics and conflict  Since 1991, Central Asians themselves have repeatedly worried aloud about the corruption and destabilization sown by klannovaya politika (‚Äúclan politics‚Äù). In the weaker Central Asian states, a clan assumes ever greater political importance because the bureaucracies cannot adequately provide for the needs of the society and the formal institutions lack legitimisation. After the fall of the USSR, the informal agreements between the clans were the only means with which to stabilize the new Republics. Aside from the eventual presence of external threats that could bring the otherwise isolated groups to collaborate with each other and a certain equilibrium between the more important clans, the essential condition that would permit the creation of such informal agreements was the identification of a leader capable of mediating the interests of all of the clans. Once they enter into effect, the agreements between clans ensure the durability of the State for as long as this last protects the clan‚Äôs interests. In a situation of great economic uncertainty, the clans become strong competitors to the State and, being more efficient in providing for the needs of their members, the clans become more powerful and influential than the State institutions. In order to meet all of the requests of their affiliates, the clans must subtract an ever growing quantity of resources from the State. Acting informally, competing clans will divide the central state‚Äôs offices and resources among themselves. The upshot is a regime that might best be called a clan hegemony. While such a regime will hardly be a democracy, neither will it be a classically authoritarian political order. Currently the clan-√©lites select the president, (the five States of Central Asia are all Presidential Republics), who must be an ombudsman for the clans‚Äô interests. These clan-√©lites may be regional governors and kolkhoz (collective farm) chairmen, or simply village elders. Almost all of the powers are concentrated in the hands of the president or his entourages‚Äô. In this way, through the presidential figure, the √©lite are able to control most of the natural resources and assets of the country and have the possibility to determine state policies. Studies of post-Soviet transitions generally interpreted conflicts through the lens of ethnic and religious conflict.

The modern historian, who consults original authorities through the-medium of some later predecessor, descends from the character of a judge to that of a faithful reporter of decisions.) Contemporary history is politically dominated by the Cold War (1945‚Äì91) between the United States and the Soviet Union whose effects were felt across the world. The confrontation, which was mainly fought through proxy wars and through intervention in the internal politics of smaller nations, ultimately ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact in 1991, following the Revolutions of 1989. The latter stages and aftermath of the Cold War enabled the democratisation of much of Europe, Africa, and Latin America. In the Middle East, the period after 1945 was dominated by conflict involving the new state of Israel and the rise of petroleum politics, as well as the growth of Islamism after the 1980s. The first supranational organisations of government, such as the United Nations and European Union, emerged during the period after 1945, while the European colonial empires in Africa and Asia collapsed, gone by 1975. Countercultures rose and the sexual revolution transformed social relations in western countries between the 1960s and 1980s, epitomised by the Protests of 1968. Living standards rose sharply across the developed world because of the post-war economic boom, whereby such major economies as Japan and West Germany emerged. The culture of the United States, especially consumerism, spread widely. By the 1960s, many western countries had begun deindustrializing; in their place, globalization led to the emergence of new industrial centres, such as Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and later China, which exported consumer goods to developed countries. Science made new advances after 1945: spaceflight, nuclear technology, laser and semiconductor technology were developed alongside molecular biology and genetics, particle physics, and the Standard Model of quantum field theory. Meanwhile, the first computers were created, followed by the Internet, beginning the Information Age. In 2020, an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus first documented in 2019 in Wuhan, China spread to other countries becoming a global pandemic which saw major socio-economic disruption all over the world, the likes of which had not been seen since the early (The Great global flu pandemic in 1918-19) and first half of the 20th century (WWII which ended in 1945). Many countries ordered mandatory lockdowns on movement and closures of non-essential businesses. It was described by some commentators as the biggest event in world history in the 21st century, new millennium and recent memory of world history.

Near the end of the first world war, there were a series of Russian Revolutions and a Russian Civil War. In between the world wars, the 1920s saw a great rise in prosperity where much of the world saw progress and new technology, but this was soon ended by the Great Depression. During this time, the League of Nations was formed to deal with global issues, but failed to garner enough support by the leading powers, and a series of crises once again led the world into another epoch of violence. =Post-1945= Notable events during the modern period of universal history include two world wars and the Cold War, characterized by the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Cold War began in 1947 and lasted until 1991. The Space Age was concurrent with this time, encompassing the activities related to the Space Race, space exploration, space technology, and the cultural developments influenced by these events. Pax Americana is an appellation applied to the historical concept of relative liberal peace in the Western world, resulting from the preponderance of power enjoyed by the United States of America after the end of World War II in 1945. The post-1945 world experienced the establishment of many new states. Throughout the post-1945 period, the Cold War was expressed through military coalitions, espionage, weapons development, invasions, propaganda, and competitive technological development. The Soviet Union created the Eastern Bloc of countries that it occupied, annexing some as Soviet Socialist Republics and maintaining others as satellite states that would later form the Warsaw Pact. The United States and various Western European countries began a Containment policy for communism and forged alliances to this end, including NATO. The conflict included defense spending, a conventional and nuclear arms race, and various proxy wars; the two superpowers never fought one another directly. The post-1989 world saw the end of the totalitarian regimes of the Cold War and the ending of client state status for many states. The Cold war was effectively ended by the Revolutions of 1989, and the Malta Summit on 3 December 1989. The Soviet Union was dissolved on 26 December 1991. Various \\"post-Cold War regimes\\" established were democratic republics, though some were authoritarian/oligarchic republics.Steven Levitsky, Lucan A. Way. Competitive Authoritarianism: Hybrid Regimes After the Cold War. 2010. Pg 3. In Latin America, military regimes supported by the CIA, such as that facilitated by the United States intervention in Chile, also fell (see also Covert United States foreign regime change actions). The Pinochet regime collapsed in 1990. In Southeast Asia, the right-wing developmental dictatorships were overthrown by popular uprisings.With the People Power Revolution, Corazon Aquino's assumption into power marked the restoration of democracy in the country. Information age and computers A Visualization of the various routes through a portion of the Internet. Partial map of the Internet based in 2005. The Information Age or Information Era, also commonly known as the Age of the Computer, is an idea that the current age will be characterized by the ability of individuals to transfer information freely, and to have instant access to knowledge that would have been difficult or impossible to find previously. The idea is heavily linked to the concept of a Digital Age or Digital Revolution, and carries the ramifications of a shift from traditional industry that the Industrial Revolution brought through industrialization, to an economy based around the manipulation of information. The period is generally said to have begun in the latter half of the 20th century, though the particular date varies. The term began its use around the late 1980s and early 1990s, and has been used up to the present with the availability of the Internet. During the late 1990s, both Internet directories and search engines were popular‚ÄîYahoo! and Altavista (both founded 1995) were the respective industry leaders. By late 2001, the directory model had begun to give way to search engines, tracking the rise of Google (founded 1998), which had developed new approaches to relevancy ranking. Directory features, while still commonly available, became after-thoughts to search engines. Database size, which had been a significant marketing feature through the early 2000s (decade), was similarly displaced by emphasis on relevancy ranking, the methods by which search engines attempt to sort the best results first. \\"Web 2.0\\" is characterized as facilitating communication, information sharing, interoperability, User- centered design and collaboration on the World Wide Web. It has led to the development and evolution of web-based communities, hosted services, and web applications. Examples include social-networking sites, video-sharing sites, wikis, blogs, mashups and folksonomies. Social networking emerged in the early 21st century as a popular social communication, largely replacing much of the function of email, message boards and instant messaging services. Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are all major examples of social websites that gained widespread popularity. The information distribution continued into the early 21st century with mobile interaction and Internet access growing massively in the early 21st century. By the 2010s, a majority of people in the developed world had Internet access and a majority of people worldwide had a mobile phone. Marking the rise of mobile computing, worldwide sales of personal computers fall 14% during the first quarter of 2013. The Semantic Web (dubbed, \\"Web 3.0\\") begins the inclusion of semantic content in web pages, converting the current web dominated by unstructured and semi-structured documents into a \\"web of data\\". With the rise of information technology, computer security, and information security in general, is a concern for computers and networks. Concerns include information and services which are protected from unintended or unauthorized access, change or destruction. This has also raised questions of Internet privacy and personal privacy globally.  Late contemporary times  =Terrorism and warfare= Major political developments in the 2000s (decade) for the United States and the Middle East revolved around recent modern terrorism, the War on Terrorism, the Afghanistan War, and the Iraq War. World Trade Center on fire and the Statue of Liberty. The September 11 attacks ‚Äì which were described as a \\"watershed moment\\" of contemporary history ‚Äì were a series of coordinated suicide attacks by Al- Qaeda upon the United States on 11 September 2001. On that morning, 19 Al- Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial passenger jet airliners. The hijackers intentionally crashed two of the airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, killing everyone on board and many others working in the buildings. Both buildings collapsed within two hours, destroying nearby buildings and damaging others. The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. The fourth plane crashed into a field near Shanksville in rural Somerset County, Pennsylvania, after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington, D.C. Major terrorist events after the 11 September 2001 Attacks include the Moscow Theatre Siege, the 2003 Istanbul bombings, the Madrid train bombings, the Beslan school hostage crisis, the 2005 London bombings, the October 2005 New Delhi bombings, and the 2008 Mumbai Hotel Siege. The United States responded to the 11 September 2001 attacks by launching a \\"Global War on Terrorism\\", invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, who had harbored al-Qaeda terrorists, and enacting the Patriot Act. Many other countries also strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded law enforcement powers. The 'Global War on Terrorism' is the military, political, legal and ideological conflict against Islamic terrorism and Islamic militants since the 2001 attacks. U.S. Army troops in Kunar province The War in Afghanistan began in late 2001 and was launched by the United States with the United Kingdom, and NATO-led, UN authorized ISAF in response to the 11 September attacks. The aim of the invasion was to find the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden and other high-ranking al-Qaeda members and put them on trial, to destroy the whole organization of al-Qaeda, and to remove the Taliban regime which supported and gave safe harbor to al-Qaeda. The Bush administration policy and the Bush Doctrine stated forces would not distinguish between terrorist organizations and nations or governments that harbor them. Two military operations in Afghanistan are fighting for control over the country. Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) is a United States combat operation involving some coalition partners and operating primarily in the eastern and southern parts of the country along the Pakistan border. The second operation is the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), which was established by the UN Security Council at the end of 2001 to secure Kabul and the surrounding areas. NATO assumed control of ISAF in 2003. The multinational infantry actions, with additional ground forces supplied by the Afghan Northern Alliance, and aerial bombing campaign removed the Taliban from power, but Taliban forces have since regained some strength. The war has been less successful in achieving the goal of restricting al-Qaeda's movement than anticipated. Since 2006, Afghanistan has seen threats to its stability from increased Taliban-led insurgent activity, record-high levels of illegal drug production, and a fragile government with limited control outside of Kabul. At the end of 2008, the war had been unsuccessful in capturing Osama bin Laden and tensions have grown between the United States and Pakistan due to incidents of Taliban fighters crossing the Pakistan border while being pursued by coalition troops. tortured in the Abu Ghraib prison The Second Gulf War began in March 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a multinational force. The invasion of Iraq led to an occupation and the eventual capture of Saddam Hussein, who was later executed by the Iraqi Government. Violence against coalition forces and among various sectarian groups soon led to asymmetric warfare with the Iraqi insurgency, strife between many Sunni and Shia Iraqi groups, and al-Qaeda operations in Iraq.U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, 2 Feb 2007, see \\"four wars\\" remark Evidence of war crimes committed and sanctioned by the United States Department of Justice created controversy globally, and helped dispel the notion of the United States as a liberating force in the War of Terror. Member nations of the Coalition withdrew their forces as public opinion favoring troop withdrawals increased and as Iraqi forces began to take responsibility for security.Britain's Brown visits officials, troops in Iraq. International Herald Tribune, 2 October 2007.Italy plans Iraq troop pull-out BBC 15 March 2005 In late 2008, the U.S. and Iraqi governments approved a Status of Forces Agreement effective through to the end of 2011.

(27 November 2008) \\"Iraq parliament OKs pact on U.S. troops' future\\" CNN In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama announced an 18-month withdrawal window for \\"combat forces\\". The Obama administration has renamed the War on Terror as the \\"Overseas Contingency Operation\\".\\"'Global War on Terror' Is Given New Name\\", Scott Wilson and Al Kamen, The Washington Post, 25 March 2009; Page A04 Its objectives are to protect US citizens and business interests worldwide, break up terrorist cells in the US, and disrupt al-Qaeda and affiliated groups. The administration has re-focused US involvement in the conflict on the withdrawal of its troops from Iraq, the closing of Guantanamo Bay detention camp, and the surge in Afghanistan. Using information obtained from Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in 2007, the name and whereabouts of one of Bin Laden's couriers, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was learned, and the courier eventually led U.S. intelligence to the location of Osama bin Laden, which was located in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles from Islamabad. On 1 May 2011, he was killed and the papers and computer drives and disks from the compound were seized. In 2011 Europe, the former Bosnian Serb Army commander Ratko Mladiƒá, wanted for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, is arrested on 26 May in Serbia by the Military Security Agency. In 2011, the United States formally declared an end to the Iraq War. The Arab Spring began in earnest in 2010 with anti-government protests in the Muslim world, but quickly escalated to full-scale military conflicts in countries like Syria, Libya, and Yemen and also gave the opportunity for the emergence of various militant groups including the Islamic State (IS). The IS was able to take advantage of social media platforms including Twitter to recruit foreign fighters from around the world and seized significant portions of territory in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt from 2013 and ongoing. On the other hand, some violent militant organizations were able to negotiate peace with governments including the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in the Philippines in 2014. The presence of IS and the stalemate in the Syrian Civil War created a migration of refugees to Europe and also galvanized and encouraged high-profile terrorism attacks and armed conflicts around the world, such as the November 2015 Paris attacks and the Battle of Marawi in the Philippines in 2017. In 2014, the United States decided to intervene against the Islamic State in Iraq, with most IS fighters being driven out by the end of 2018. Russia and Iran also jointly launched a campaign against IS in Syria, in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, coming at odds with United States aims. The Government of Russia, largely led by President Vladimir Putin, have opposed the enlargement of NATO as encroaching on Russian autonomy. In the last fifteen years, they have intervened in a variety of military conflicts in its neighboring countries including Georgia and Ukraine (leading to the annexation of Crimea and an ongoing war in Eastern Ukraine). =Great Recession= In the beginning of the 2000s (decade), there was a global rise in prices in commodities and housing, marking an end to the commodities recession of 1980‚Äì2000. The US mortgage-backed securities, which had risks that were hard to assess, were marketed around the world and a broad based credit boom fed a global speculative bubble in real estate and equities. The financial situation was also affected by a sharp increase in oil and food prices. The collapse of the American housing bubble caused the values of securities tied to real estate pricing to plummet thereafter, damaging financial institutions.\\"Jarvis, Jonathan. Crisis of Credit\\". crisisofcredit.com The late-2000s recession, a severe economic recession which began in the United States in 2007,In December 2008, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) declared that the United States had been in recession since December 2007. See for more information. was sparked by the outbreak of a modern financial crisis. The modern financial crisis was linked to earlier lending practices by financial institutions and the trend of securitization of American real estate mortgages. The emergence of Sub-prime loan losses exposed other risky loans and over-inflated asset prices. The Great RecessionSee Great Recession for the origins and other uses of this label. spread to much of the industrialized world,One of the major developments was when Standard & Poor's downgraded Greece's sovereign credit rating to junk four days after the activation of a ‚Ç¨45-billion EU‚ÄìIMF bailout, triggering the decline of stock markets worldwide and of the Euro's value, and furthered the European sovereign debt crisis. and has caused a pronounced deceleration of economic activity. The global recession occurred in an economic environment characterized by various imbalances. This global recession has resulted in a sharp drop in international trade, rising unemployment and slumping commodity prices. The recession renewed interest in Keynesian economic ideas on how to combat recessionary conditions. However, various industrial countries continued to undertake austerity policies to cut deficits, reduced spending, as opposed to following Keynesian theories. Countries by real GDP growth rate in 2014. (Countries in brown were in recession.) From late 2009 European sovereign-debt crisis, fears of a sovereign debt crisis developed among investors concerning rising government debt levels across the globe together with a wave of downgrading of government debt of certain European states. Concerns intensified early 2010 and thereafter making it difficult or impossible for sovereigns to re-finance their debts. On 9 May 2010, Europe's Finance Ministers approved a rescue package worth ‚Ç¨750 billion aimed at ensuring financial stability across Europe. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was a special purpose vehicle financed by members of the eurozone to combat the European sovereign debt crisis. In October 2011 eurozone leaders agreed on another package of measures designed to prevent the collapse of member economies. The three most affected countries, Greece, Ireland and Portugal, collectively account for six percent of eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP). In 2012, Eurozone finance ministers reached an agreement on a second ‚Ç¨130-billion Greek bailout. In 2013, the European Union agreed to a ‚Ç¨10 billion economic bailout for Cyprus. =Contemporary world= Present and future The world is in the millennium. The century is the century of the Christian Era or Common Era in accordance with the Gregorian calendar. It began on 1 January 2001 and will end 31 December 2100. The , or The , decade runs from 1 January , to 31 December . The third millennium is the third period of one thousand years. As this millennium is in progress, only its first decade, the 2000s (decade), can be the subject of the conventional historian's attention. The remaining part of the 21st century and longer-term trends are researched by futures studies, an approach that uses various models and several methods (such as \\"forecasting\\" and \\"backcasting\\"). Ever since the invention of history, people have searched for \\"lessons\\" that might be drawn from its study, on the principle that to understand the past is potentially to control the future.Robert V. Daniels, \\"History\\", Encyclopedia Americana, 1986 ed., vol. 14, p. 227. A famous quote by George Santayana has it that \\"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\\"George Santayana, \\"The Life of Reason\\", Volume One, p. 82, BiblioLife, Arnold J. Toynbee, in his monumental Study of History, sought regularities in the rise and fall of civilizations.Arnold J. Toynbee, A Study of History, vols. I‚ÄìXII, Oxford University Press, 1934‚Äì61. In a more popular vein, Will and Ariel Durant devoted a 1968 book, The Lessons of History, to a discussion of \\"events and comments that might illuminate present affairs, future possibilities... and the conduct of states.\\"Will and Ariel Durant, The Lessons of History, New York, Simon and Schuster, 1968, prelude. Discussions of history's lessons often tend to an excessive focus on historic detail or, conversely, on sweeping historiographic generalizations.Berkeley Eddins and Georg G. Iggers, \\"History\\", Encyclopedia Americana, 1986 ed., vol. 14, pp. 243‚Äì44. Future Studies takes as one of its important attributes (epistemological starting points) the ongoing effort to analyze alternative futures. This effort includes collecting quantitative and qualitative data about the possibility, probability, and desirability of change. The plurality of the term \\"futures\\" in futurology denotes the rich variety of alternative futures, including the subset of preferable futures (normative futures), that can be studied. Practitioners of the discipline previously concentrated on extrapolating present technological, economic or social trends, or on attempting to predict future trends, but more recently they have started to examine social systems and uncertainties and to build scenarios, question the worldviews behind such scenarios via the causal layered analysis method (and others) create preferred visions of the future, and use backcasting to derive alternative implementation strategies. Apart from extrapolation and scenarios, many dozens of methods and techniques are used in futures research.For the multidisciplinary area of research focused at mathematical modeling of historical dynamics that can be applied to events, see Cliodynamics Socio- technological trends At the end of the 20th century, the world was at a major crossroads. Throughout the century, more technological advances had been made than in all of preceding history. Computers, the Internet, and other modern technology radically altered daily lives. Increased globalization, specifically Americanization, had occurred. While not necessarily a threat, it has sparked anti-Western and anti-American sentiment in parts of the developing world, especially the Middle East. The English language has become a leading global language, with people who did not speak it becoming increasingly disadvantaged. A trend connecting economic and political events in North America, Asia, and the Middle East is the rapidly increasing demand for fossil fuels, which, along with fewer new petroleum finds, greater extraction costs (see peak oil), and political turmoil, saw the price of gas and oil soar ~500% between 2000 and 2005. In some places, especially in Europe, gas could be $5 a gallon, depending on the currency. Less influential, but omnipresent, is the debate on Turkey's participation in the European Union. New urbanism and urban revival continue to be forces in urban planning in the United States.The bold urban future starts now ‚Äì Dream City ‚Äì Salon.com However, evidence shows that growth of American suburbs still outpaces urban growth. =Challenges and problems= World distribution of wealth and population in 2000. In the contemporary era, several issues are faced in the world. First of all, wealth is concentrated among the G8 and Western industrialized nations, along with several Asian nations and OPEC countries. The richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000 and that the richest 10% of adults accounted for 85% of the world total. The bottom half of the world adult population owned barely 1% of global wealth.Extensive statistics, many indicating the growing world disparity, are included in the available report, press releases, Excel tables and Powerpoint slides. See The World Distribution of Household Wealth. James B. Davies, Susanna Sandstrom, Anthony Shorrocks, and Edward N. Wolff. 5 December 2006. * Launch of the WIDER study on The World Distribution of Household Wealth (includes press release, summary, and data) * Estimating the Level and Distribution of Global Household Wealth (copy of full report with a cover page added) * The World Distribution of Household Wealth (exact copy of report published at United Nations website) For more. Another study found that the richest 2% own more than half of global household assets.The rich really do own the world 5 December 2006 Despite this, the distribution has been changing quite rapidly in the direction of greater concentration of wealth. Climate change Climate change and global warming reflects the notion of the modern climate. The changes of climate over the past century, have been attributed to various factors which have resulted in a global warming. This warming is the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and oceans since the mid-20th century and its projected continuation. Some effects on both the natural environment and human life are, at least in part, already being attributed to global warming. A 2001 report by the IPCC suggests that glacier retreat, ice shelf disruption such as that of the Larsen Ice Shelf, sea level rise, changes in rainfall patterns, and increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events are attributable in part to global warming. Other expected effects include water scarcity in some regions and increased precipitation in others, changes in mountain snowpack, and adverse health effects from warmer temperatures. It usually is impossible to connect specific weather events to human impact on the world. Instead, such impact is expected to cause changes in the overall distribution and intensity of weather events, such as changes to the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation. Broader effects are expected to include glacial retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and worldwide sea level rise. Other effects may include changes in crop yields, addition of new trade routes, species extinctions, and changes in the range of disease vectors. Until 2009, the Arctic Northwest Passage pack ice prevented regular marine shipping throughout most of the year in this area, but climate change has reduced the pack ice, and this Arctic shrinkage made the waterways more navigable.European Space Agency, \\"News: Satellites Witness Lowest Arctic Ice Coverage in History,\\" 14 September 2007.\\"Warming 'opens Northwest Passage'\\". BBC News. 14 September 2007.BBC News \\"Plain Sailing on the Northwest Passage\\" Contemporary technologies Various emerging technologies, the recent developments and convergences in various fields of technology, hold possible future impacts. Emerging technologies cover various cutting-edge developments in the emergence and convergence of technology, including transportation, information technology, biotechnology, robotics and applied mechanics, and material science. Their status and possible effects involve controversy over the degree of social impact or the viability of the technologies. Though, these represent new and significant developments within a field; converging technologies represent previously distinct fields which are in some way moving towards stronger inter-connection and similar goals. The first fully functional Space Shuttle orbiter was Columbia (designated OV-102), launched into Earth orbit in April 1981. In 1996, Shuttle mission STS-75 conducted research in space with the electrodynamic tether generator and other tether configurations. In 135 missions, the program suffered with two shuttles destroyed.For more, see Space Shuttle Challenger disaster and Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. The successful landing at Kennedy Space Center after completing STS-135 concluded the shuttle program. The Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program began in 2006. The retirement of NASA's Space Shuttle fleet took place from March to July 2011. There are various spaceports, including spaceports of human spaceflight and other launch systems (space logistics). Private spaceflight is flight beyond the K√°rm√°n lineThis is above the nominal edge of space at 100 km (62 mi) Earth's altitude. See also: Turbopause; Low, Medium, and High Earth orbit. that is conducted and paid for by an entity other than a government agency. Commercialization of space is the use of equipment sent into or through outer space to provide goods or services of commercial value, either by a corporation or state. Space trade plans and predictions began in the 1960s. Spacecraft propulsionThere are many different methods, in conventional and unconventional propulsion systems. Each method has drawbacks and advantages, and spacecraft propulsion is an active area of research. However, most spacecraft today are propelled by forcing a gas from the back/rear of the vehicle at very high speed through a supersonic de Laval nozzle.

History The group was formed in December 2002 by Sergio G√≥mez, Oscar Zepeda, Jos√© Luis Corral, Jair Loredo, Armando Rodr√≠guez, and two ex-members of Grupo Montez de Durango, Rafael Sol√≠s and Simon Valt√≠rrez Valles. It was in the town of Bensenville, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, where Sergio G√≥mez met Armando Rodr√≠guez and Rafael Sol√≠s, who invited him to form a musical group to perform covers of hits from groups such as Los Yonics, Los Bukis, among others, but with the style and rhythm of the so- called Duranguense genre. This musical project began in the basement of the house of Armando and Rafael, along with Sergio who at that time worked in a 'light club' and other groups of the Duranguense genre as sound engineer, forming K-Paz de la Sierra together. K-Paz de la Sierra became well known in the United States in just the first two months of the band‚Äôs debut. The company Procan Disa Records was its main speaker.http://www.kpazdelasierra.tk/ Band members Current band members are: * Jesus ‚ÄúChuy‚Äù Morales (1ra Voz) * Gabriel Frias (Teclados 1ro) * Frank Sanchez (Bater√≠a) * Victor Cardoso (Tuba El√©ctrica) * Juan Antonio Guerrero (Teclados 2do) * Luis Guadarrama (2da Voz) * Rafael Martinez (Tambora) =Former members= Former band members were: Sergio G√≥mez, Juan G√≥mez, Sergio Caballero, Miguel Galindo, Oscar Ledezma, Gerardo Ram√≠rez, Luis D√≠az Humberto Dur√°n, Armando Rodr√≠guez, Carmelo Gamboa, Jos√© Luis Corral, Luis Garc√≠a, Alfredo Hern√°ndez, Rafael Sol√≠s, Jair Loredo, Luis Vidales, Guillermo Rocha, Gabriel Guadarrama, Jorge Gardu√±o(Jagsx). History =La Autoridad de la Sierra= In October 2004, following their 2nd album, Pensando En Ti, 4 Original Members: Jair Loredo, Oscar Zepeda, Simon Valtierrez, and Jose Luis Corral, left to form La Autoridad De La Sierra along Arturo Palomar, Juan Soberanis and Pedro Vargas. Jair Loredo returned to K-Paz in 2007. =AK-7= On May 28, 2007, Sergio Gomez Wanted To Be A Solo Artist With The Name Of K-Paz Dela Sierra & Because Of This All Members Except Beto Duran Left the group to form AK-7, which stands for \\"Antes K-Paz\\", which translates literally to \\"Before K-Paz\\" signaling that they were once K-paz. The 7 refers to the number of members who left K-Paz. =Majestad de la Sierra= In the middle of 2008, 5 members separated and created a new musical group also of the Duranguense genre with the name of Majestad De La Sierra. The 3rd separation originated in a conflict with Ju√°n G√≥mez brother of the deceased Sergio G√≥mez and with Beto Duran, because the latter canceled the recording of an album in Monterrey. On January 29, 2009, K-Paz presented new members under the direction of Juan G√≥mez (brother of the deceased vocalist) Kompendo de la Sierra: * Miguel Galindo: Vocals * Luis Eduardo Guadarrama: Vocals * Sergio Caballero: Keyboard and Musical Director * Gabriel Guadarrama: Keyboard * Fernando del Valle: Electric Tuba * Juan G√≥mez: Tambora * Jorge Gardu√±o: Electric Tuba * Jair Loredo: Drums With a new image, a new voice, but with a stronger name than ever, K-Paz de la Sierra, after his great success of Como un Tatuaje, managed to get back on top of success and popularity, remaining when They released their second single to the radio, called \\"I'd like to be an idiot\\", which managed to be screened throughout the country and the American Union. The album As a Tattoo, led them to be nominated for the OYE Awards! 2009, as Best Grupo Banda Duranguense, and subsequently to the Premio Lo Nuestro 2010 in the category of Duranguense Artist of the Year. And it is also in 2010, that K-PAZ DE LA SIERRA launches a third promotional cut, this is Armando Manzanero's classic \\"Adoro\\", a duo with Lupe Esparza, the Lead Singer & Bass Player of Bronco/Gigante De America in a vibrant Duranguense version. K-Paz de la Sierra continues forward. Because the success of the group has not been even a simple fashion, and the proof of it is shown in countries like Mexico, the United States, Spain, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador. K-Paz de la Sierra is a concrete phenomenon, of which only appear each time, and proof of them was their participation in the recording of the song and the classic video of Michael Jackson \\"We are the world\\", which in its Spanish version ( \\"We are the world\\") was designed and produced by Emilio Estefan, who extended the invitation to the group so that part of this project to help Haiti, for the earthquake suffered. \\"For life\\" is the new title of the album of K-Paz de la Sierra, and also the phrase that carries the banner with his desire that his music last forever in the minds and hearts of the public. This is what he has followed during his years of trajectory. In this album K-Paz de la Sierra includes in its total unreleased tracks, one of them being the one that has been released as the first single and that is entitled \\"Ni se se ocurra\\". duet included in the production. But this one was special, since it was recorded next to Mr. Sergio Vega \\"el Shaka\\", thus being the last musical recording made by the singer of the band before his death. This album has 10 songs that allow you to listen to songs by the composers of the likes of Horacio Palencia, Claudia Brant, Edgar Cort√°zar, Oswaldo Villarreal and Aaron Mart√≠nez, Sergio Caballero and Jair Loredo. From this album comes the second single titled \\"Me Tienes Embrujado\\", authored by Sergio Caballero and Jair Loredo. Reaching the first places of popularity in Mexico and the United States. Now the Group is preparing Dos Mega Producciones, their new Disco album, which can already be heard a super theme that was made with the Chino Y Nacho Artists, the theme taken by title \\"The Poet\\" that will be added to the new album as a bonus track. Adding the Celebration of its Tenth Anniversary, which was celebrated in December 2012. They anticipated that they would do a compilation of performances by Sergio G√≥mez, where they would be singing through the screens Together with K-paz De La Sierra That Great Night. This celebration is for the public that saw the birth of this Association. = Felicitas, widow of G√≥mez = In 2011, K-Paz De La Sierra suffers a further break from his disciples Juan G√≥mez and Miguel Galindo due to mismanagement of the group. In 2012 the group suffered another collapse, leaving their archives, Sergio Caballero (keyboardist) and Jair Loredo (drummer) for alleged salary debit by Felicitas. In October 2012 the group of Felicitas, launched \\"El Fuerte\\" and for May 2014 launched \\"En Esta Cantina\\". = K-Paz de la Sierra 2016 to the present = In April 2016 the lawsuit for the name of K-Paz De La Sierra came to an end, Sergio G√≥mez's widow, Felicitas G√≥mez, won, even with threats that Juan G√≥mez could go to jail, also in mid-2016 Sergio Caballero returns to the ranks of K-Paz de la Sierra. At the moment the group prepares its new record production for October of this 2016 called \\"Indestructible\\", same that will count on subjects of Horacio Palencia (Cambiemos el Trato), Luciano Moon (Le Atine), Gabriel Flowers (Quien Invento El Amor), Cecilia C√°diz / Pablo Castro (Para Amarte) and Sergio Caballero (Indestructible) theme that emerges as the first single. After the lawsuit the official alignment of K-Paz de la Sierra was as follows: * Luis Eduardo Guadarrama: voice * Jorge Gardu√±o: Electric Tuba * Gabriel Guadarrama: Keyboards * Romelio Crespo: Tambora * Frank S√°nchez: Battery During 2017 K-Paz De La Sierra has been touring throughout the United States and Mexico, making known who they are and have always been, although they wage a battle against ex-member Juan G√≥mez, who continues to use the name of K-Paz De La Sierra illegally in other countries of Central and South America deceiving the faithful followers of this group. Its members always invite businessmen not to be cheated or cheated by these misleading groups that only hurt the fans of K-Paz De La Sierra. Currently, the group conducts international tours in Central America with resounding success in Guatemala, along with the resounding success it had in his first visit to Colombia, where his fans sang all the repertoire of the group without losing the smallest detail.

History \\"Fiesta in Palenque\\" traditional African Colombian dance from San Basilio de Palenque, a former enclave, now considered by the UNESCO a Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Africans were taken to Colombia as slaves in the beginning of the 16th Century from places such as modern day Congo, Angola, Gambia, Nigeria, Cameroon, Liberia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Senegal and Mali to replace the rapidly declining Native American population. African slaves were forced to work in gold mines, on sugar cane plantations, cattle ranches, and large haciendas. African workers pioneered the extraction of alluvial gold deposits and the growing of sugar cane in the areas that correspond to the modern day departments of Choc√≥, Antioquia, Cauca, Valle del Cauca, and Nari√±o in western Colombia. The UNODOC reported 66% of the alluvial gold is illegally mined, with 42% of these illegal activities directly affecting AfroColumbian communities. In eastern Colombia, near the cities of V√©lez, C√∫cuta, Socorro and Tunja, Africans manufactured textiles in commercial mills. Emerald mines outside of Bogot√° relied on African laborers. Other sectors of the Colombian economy, like tobacco, cotton, artisanship and domestic work would have been impossible without African labor. In pre-abolition Colombian society, many AfroColombian captives fought the Spanish, their colonial forces and their freedom as soon as they arrived in Colombia. Those who escaped from their oppressors would live in free Black African towns called Palenques, where they would live as \\"Cimarrones\\", or fugitives. Some historians considered Choc√≥ to be a very big palenque, with a large population of Cimarrones. Especially in the areas of the Baud√≥ River. This is where Cimarr√≥n leaders like Benkos Bioh√≥ and Barule fought for freedom. African people played key roles in the struggle for independence from Spain. Historians note that three of every five soldiers in Simon Bol√≠var's army were African. AfroColombians were able to participate at all levels of military and political life. In 1851, the life of AfroColombians was very difficult. The AfroColombians were forced to live in the jungles for self-protection. There they learned to have a harmonious relationship with the jungle environment and share the territory with Colombia's indigenous people. From 1851, the Colombian State promoted the ideology of mestizaje, or miscegenation. In order to maintain their cultural traditions, many Africans and indigenous peoples went deep into isolated jungles. AfroColombians and indigenous people were often targeted by armed groups who wanted to displace them in order to take their land for sugar cane plantations, coffee and banana plantations, mining and wood exploitation. This form of discrimination still occurs today. In 1945, the department of El Choc√≥ was created, the first predominantly African political-administrative division in the country. El Choc√≥ provided the possibility of building an African territorial identity and some autonomous decision-making power. Demographics thumbright200pxThe African Colombian population in Colombia is mostly concentrated in coastal areas. AfroColombian children In the 1970s, there was a major influx of AfroColombians into the urban areas in search of greater economic and social opportunities for their children. This led to an increase in the number of urban poor in the marginal areas of big cities like Cali, Medell√≠n, and Bogot√°. Most AfroColombians are currently living in urban areas. Only around 25%, or 1.2 million people, are based in rural areas, compared to 75%, or 3.7 million people, in urban zones. The 1991 Colombian Constitution gave them the right to collective ownership of traditional Pacific coastal lands and special cultural development protections. Critics argue that this important legal instrument is not enough to completely address their social and developmental needs. AfroColombians make up 6.68% of the population, almost 3 million people, according to a projection of the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DAN), most of whom are concentrated on the northwest Caribbean coast and the Pacific coast in such departments as Choc√≥, whose capital, Quibd√≥, is 95.3% AfroColombian as opposed to just 2.3% mestizo or white. Considerable numbers are also in Cali, Cartagena and Barranquilla. Colombia is considered to have the fourth largest Black/African-descent population in the western hemisphere, following Haiti, Brazil and the United States. It has been estimated that only 4.4 million AfroColombians actively recognize their black ancestry, while many other African Colombians do not as a result of inter- racial relations with white and indigenous Colombians. AfroColombians often encounter a noticeable degree of racial discrimination and prejudice, possibly as a socio-cultural leftover from colonial times. They have been historically absent from high-level government positions. Many of their long-established settlements around the Pacific coast have remained underdeveloped. In Colombia's ongoing internal conflict, AfroColombians are both victims of violence and displacement as well as members of armed factions, such as the FARC and the AUC. African Colombians have played a role in contributing to the development of certain aspects of Colombian culture. For example, several of Colombia's musical genres, such as Cumbia and Vallenato, have African origins or influences. Some African Colombians have also been successful in sports, such as Olympic weightlifter √ìscar Figueroa and footballer, Patrocinio Bonilla, also known as \\"Patr√≥n\\" (believed to have been murdered August 11, 2020).  Cultural contribution  = Music = In Colombia, native songs and musical genres are characterized by an exchange of multiple energetic and progressive musical processes. Notable examples include bambuco, cumbia, and porro, which are examples of typical folkloric musical genres that can be traced to having an African origin, descent, or influence in style.  Bambuco  The Bambuco has a unique indigenous origin, but is also composed of a multicultural tradition. The Bambuco is established in the central Andean and Cauca area of the country of Colombia and is played by string ensembles. The Bambuco combines elements of notations that fluctuate between a or meter, demonstrating its extreme flexibility. It can be portrayed in different instrumental variants such as the Bambuco fiestero (a faster more playful rhythm) or the contemporary Bambuco. It is believed that the Bambuco is a musical genre that inevitability was brought by the Africans when the first slaves arrived at Cauca region. There is also a relationship between Bambuco and the name of a town in French Sudan \\"Bambuk,\\" and it has been theorized that this genre comes from that specific region. Another piece of evidence is the syncopation and other forms of rhythms within the same piece of music. African music utilizes syncopated rhythms just like Bambuco does. Others theorized different appearances of Bambuco in different locations of the country, but they all coincide in an African origin or inspiration for the formation of this musical genre. For instance, on the western side of what is now Mali, a century ago, a nation named \\"Bambouk\\" existed and potentially the name of bambuco was derived from this nation in Mali. In a country at the horn of Africa in Eritrea, there is a town called Bambuco. In Angola, there is a town called Bambuca and very close to that town there is another one called Cauca. Like mentioned above, the Cauca department is argued to be the place where the Bambuco genre emerged. A different branch of bambuco emerged in the Pacific Coast of Colombia, the contemporary Bambuco. The pacific coast and the northern coast of Colombia have an AfroColombian population that surpasses the average in comparison to any other region in the country (90% and 50%, respectively). In the region of Cauca at the coast and in between the Magdalena River, the most traditional black population is settled. Many slaves came in through the Cauca River or the Magdalena River, if they were to have come from the northern side of the country. On the other hand, the argument that the Bambuco evolved in the Pacific is supported by the biggest population of AfroColombians in the country residing in the department of Choco, on the Pacific coast. The Pacific coast is the only place in the country where the absolute majority is of African descent. The reason for the Pacific coast's vast majority AfroColombian population is not only due to its location and the rapid entrance of transportation of boats and slaves during colonization, but also due to emancipation around the year 1815. The act of emancipation led for the Pacific coast to become a refugee zone and develop into a safer place for slaves from the Choco area as well as those from the interior of the country and other urban sites throughout the country. This allowed for the AfroColombian population to grow in this region of the country and therefore develop within certain cultural characteristics such musical genres that have African descent but are born or popularized in Colombia. With this evidence, although the Bambuco is not originally from Colombia, it became a national identity for many due to its multicultural composition. It has since spread from west to north in the country.  Cumbia  The cumbia is another typical Colombian musical genre that emerged from the African slaves in Colombia. In this case, cumbia is a mixture of rhythms from AfroColombians and indigenous native Colombiansto bring about a different style. Unlike the Bambuco, cumbia certainly originated in the northern part of Colombia, and its instrumentation is the key evidence of its origin, as well as its dances. Particular to cumbia, a typical Spanish dress was adapted to available native resources. In the present day, it is culturally significant enough to know about cumbia, and it is a concern to preserve it. The main festival that celebrates cumbia nowadays is the Festival de la Cumbia in El Banco, Magdalena. In order to preserve this folkloric rhythm, this genre is celebrated yearly in the Colombian coastal region.  Champeta  Throughout the years, the African heritage in music has been evolving from bambuco to porro to cumbia to champeta. Champeta is the more modern rhythm inspired by African culture and music style. The Champeta is born through a blend of African and Caribbean rhythms, including the cumbia. The name champeta is derived by a form of Bowie knife that only low income, rural workers, usually people of African descent, would use due to their low socioeconomic status. These Bowie knives are used to cut the grass, and keep yards or streets clean, and therefore this musical genre is associated with a status and also race. This genre is native to the northern coast and experimentation with many new rhythms is common. Thus a lot of commerce emerged around these varying new rhythms and much more music has become available from the African continent. This is another example of the multicultural composition of musical genres due to the diaspora throughout the country of Colombia.  Current issues faced by AfroColombians  Ever since AfroColombians arrived in Colombia in the first decade of the 16th century, they have been considered a minority group by the Colombian government, which has exposed them to discrimination and inequality. Many advocacy groups, including the National Association of Displaced AfroColombians (AFRODES) or Chao Racismo, as well as various AfroColombian activists, have come together to fight for this ethnic group's rights. However, AfroColombians continue to protest for their rights and demand equality between themselves and all non- AfroColombians in certain social aspects. Social issues concerning AfroColombians range from socio-economic inequalities to physical violence and other forms of inequality and discrimination. = Educational disparities in AfroColombian life= There is an acknowledgment that there is a subtle racist undertone in Colombia. There is a lack of implementing the history of AfroColombian culture, language, and overall visibility within Colombian educational hubs. Even so, their history is not told correctly to the Colombian people. \\"C√°tedra De Estudios Afrocolombianos.\\" Afrocolombianidad y Educacion Como Poltica De Estado - Ministerio De Educacion Nacional De Colombia, https://www.mineducacion.gov.co/1621/article-87286.html It is recorded that the African slaves that entered throughout the 15th to 18th century were not given their freedom by the republic but by their own accord. During religious festivals and other days, slaves were permitted to work for their profit. Then, they would save up their money to buy their freedom. This marked the beginning of AfroColombians and their relationship with Colombia. In 2007, the Colombian national government implemented a new section in the government for AfroColombians called \\"la Comisi√≥n Intersectorial para el Avance de la Poblaci√≥n Afrocolombiana, Palenquera y Raizal.\\" This sector was intended for the advancement of the education of AfroColombians. Not only this but the Colombian government had also conducted specialized studies and 18 workshops across the cities of Colombia. Due to this, about 4000 AfroColombian community leaders came together to write recommendations to the government by May 2009. \\"Afrocolombianidad y Educaci√≥n Como Pol√≠tica De Estado.\\" Afrocolombianidad y Educacion Como Poltica De Estado - Ministerio De Educacion Nacional De Colombia, https://www.mineducacion.gov.co/1621/article-208086.html However, after many years, none of the strategies have worked and AfroColombians still lack the same opportunities as their whiter Colombian counterparts. The Colombian government has tried to help the AfroColombian people by creating more programs to further the education of AfroColombians past high school. The main program is the \\"Admisi√≥n Especial a Mejores Bachilleres de la Poblaci√≥n Negra, Afrocolombiana, Palenquera y Raizal\\" which gives admission to about 200 AfroColombians per semester into the National Colombian University. This program can be compared to affirmative action in the United States, once again highlighting the imbalance of opportunities for AfroColombians. The Ministry of Education has attempted to make recommendations on the subject of the background and history of AfroColombians when teaching Colombian history. In hopes of incorporating more AfroColombian history, the ministry of education plans to add AfroColombian history on exams of the state. = Socio-economic inequalities = AfroColombians are a significant portion (almost one quarter) of Colombia's overall population, yet they are one of the poorest ethnic groups of the country. More specifically, studies have shown that three-quarters of the Colombian population which is classified as being \\"poor\\", is composed of AfroColombians. This is reflected in some of the most basic, daily, aspects of their lives, such as the average annual salary of AfroColombians. While people from this ethnic group earn, on average, 500 dollars a year (or 1.5 million Colombian pesos) people that are from White or Mestizo ethnic groups earn an average of 1500 dollars a year (or 4.5 million Colombian Pesos). This means that the average AfroColombian earns three times less than the average White/Mestizo Colombian. This issue roots primarily from the fact that in Colombia, blacks do not have the same educational, and economic opportunities as the rest of the population. They also have very few life opportunities such as limited access to jobs. These are the factors that contribute to an 80 percent rate of poverty among African descendants.Robinson, Lori S. \\"Fighting for Black Lives in Colombia: At War's End, the Search for a Seat at the Table.\\" The Root, The Root, 3 July 2017, www.theroot.com/fighting-for-black-lives-in-colombia-at-war-s-end- the-1796521962. The World Bank recently reported that the percentage of AfroColombians that receive primary education is higher than the percentage of primary education received by the rest of Colombians, being 42% versus 32%, respectively. However, many AfroColombians are not able to receive any higher education besides primary level education because secondary education (or high school education) is only offered to 62% of AfroColombians, while this type of education is offered to 75% of all other Colombians. Furthermore, researchers have found that the overall educational quality of schools located in AfroColombian communities is much lower and poorer than those in other communities, mainly because of the lack of government support and investment in these areas. This was reflected in the results of the ICFES exam (national standardized exam), which showed that the average results for AfroColombians were significantly lower than the results of the rest of Colombians. Given that only a very few numbers of AfroColombians can reach college/university education, the range of jobs for most AfroColombians is very limited and obtaining high-level jobs with a good salary is very difficult for them to achieve. White Colombians in Bogota strengthen already existing racial ladders and reinforce them in urban areas through spatial isolation‚Äîplacing racism and racial discrimination external to their social worlds.Castro, Fatimah Williams. \\"AfroColombians and the Cosmopolitan City: New Negotiations of Race and Space in Bogot√°, Colombia.\\" Latin American Perspectives, vol. 40, no. 2, 2013, pp. 105‚Äì117. JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/23466025. Discrimination based on race and spatial isolation affects the interaction between citizens in urban spaces. Urban researchers have found drastic economic differences between the residents of Bogota. Suburbs are segregated and more uniform with people with similar incomes. This stratification has a racial and economic element to it. AfroColombians are segregated and live in all 19 sectors of the city, which are sectors with the two lowest stratum classification such as designations, Bosa, Kennedy, and Ciudad Bolivar, which are situated very far away from Zona Rosa, a city full of nightlife and entertainment.Castro, Fatimah Williams. \\"AfroColombians and the Cosmopolitan City: New Negotiations of Race and Space in Bogot√°, Colombia.\\" Latin American Perspectives, vol. 40, no. 2, 2013, pp. 105‚Äì117. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/23466025. = Statistics on jobs and politics = According to a study, between 2002 and 2010 AfroColombian legislators proposed 25 bills directly affecting the AfroColombian community and only two bills were approved.Soendergaard, Maren. \\"How Political Exclusion Affects Colombia's Afro-descendant Minority.\\" Colombia News  Colombia Reports, 26 Feb. 2015, https://colombiareports.com/afrocolombian-political-exclusion-effects-social- indicators/. Another study done by the National Union School found that 65% of AfroColombians in the informal sector and 29% in the formal sector make less than the minimum wage.Hern√°ndez, Tanya Kater√≠. \\"Revealing the Race-Based Realities of Workforce Exclusion.\\" NACLA, 9 Feb. 2015, https://nacla.org/article/revealing-race-based-realities-workforce-exclusion/. = Example of social inequality = The racism in Colombia is so extreme that it can get AfroColombians stopped for just looking suspicious. It maximizes where they can go and where they cannot. For instance, AfroColombians are prevented from getting into some nightclubs and restaurants. They are denied entrance to certain places where many elites and tourists usually go. People have been moved aside and questioned because of their skin color, while other people can get in without further questioning. Bouncers usually tell them that they are hosting a private party and they need invitations to get in.Castro, Fatimah Williams. \\"AfroColombians and the Cosmopolitan City: New Negotiations of Race and Space in Bogot√°, Colombia.\\" Latin American Perspectives, vol. 40, no. 2, 2013, pp. 105‚Äì117. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/23466025 They use this as an excuse to stop them from entering these places. = Effects of the war on AfroColombians = Colombia's civil war began in the year 1964 and finished in the year 2017, when a peace treaty between the guerrilla movement (FARC) and the government was concreted and signed. This long civil war affected and continues to affect most Colombians, however, according to the World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous People (WDMIP), some particular communities have been significantly more affected than others. One of these, says WDMIP, are AfroColombian communities, who have been strongly impacted by the civil war, mainly because of their vulnerability and lack of protection from the government. For years, the FARC guerrilla has sought areas to invade and gain possession of as many Colombian territories as they can. Territories that are occupied by minority groups such as indigenous groups and AfroColombians are typically the poorest and therefore seen as the easiest areas to invade. Many AfroColombian regions have been \\"attacked\\" and taken over by the FARC, which has resulted in more than 2 million AfroColombians being displaced. Most of them have been forced to migrate towards bigger cities (like Bogot√°, Cali, or Medell√≠n), which has increased their level of poverty (due to the higher cost of living in such urban areas), as well as their exposure to discrimination and violence. Even though the occurrences of these scenarios has significantly decreased since the peace treaty was signed last year, the people who were displaced continue to be affected by this situation and struggle to go back to their hometowns. On another hand, the civil war has made AfroColombians victims of violence because AfroColombian territories, such as El Choc√≥, have become the combat zone between the FARC guerrilla and the Colombian government. More specifically, this means that they have been exposed to bombs, shootings, and deaths at a much higher level than all other Colombians. Because of this, many AfroColombians have been victims of collateral damage and have been killed due to this war, which has become another major reason for displacement to occur. According to research done by one of Colombia's official radio stations called Caracol Radio, over 25% of AfroColombians have left their hometown due to violence. Finally, another conflict that has been generated by the civil war is that of drug trafficking and prostitution. For years, the FARC guerrilla was seeking to recruit people that would do this for them at a low cost. Given that a high percentage of AfroColombians are extremely poor, young people from these communities are tempted by these options because they see them as the only way out to combat the poverty in which they live. As a result, over 40% of the people in the guerrilla group is composed of AfroColombians who now support the conflict and have been manipulated to continue supporting that side of the conflict. = Health disparities = A recent study conducted by the London School of Economics revealed that AfroColombians are at an extreme disadvantage in terms of being healthy when compared to the rest of the Colombian population. Furthermore, this study showed that many socioeconomic factors are involved in this and that contribute to such disparities. For example, the fact that AfroColombians are much poorer than the rest of the Colombian population is one of the main reasons that they are in a position of disadvantage when it comes to seeking health care services and being healthy in general. This is supported by their findings that showed that just under 5% of AfroColombians have medical insurance, compared to almost 30% of all non-AfroColombians. Additionally, they found that most AfroColombians live in unsanitary conditions that increase exposure to a large variety of diseases as well as a common trend among AfroColombian children with bad health. This is often due to uneducated mothers. Health inequality has negatively affected many minorities in Colombia; particularly those from a very low socioeconomic status such as AfroColombians. In comparison with the indigenous populations in Colombia, AfroColombians are at a greater disadvantage when it comes to access to health care. Research from 2003 shows that 53.8% of blacks did not have access to health insurance compared to 37.9% of the indigenous population. Only 10.64% of AfroColombians were affiliated to the subsidized regime in comparison with most of the indigenous population. Moreover, 65.8% vs. 74.6% of non-minorities groups characterized their health status as very good and good while 30.7% vs. 22.7% of indigenous and AfroColombians described it as fair and 3.5% vs. 2.8% as poor. This reveals the health disparities among minority groups in Colombia in comparison with the rest of the population.Bernal, Raquel, and Mauricio C√°rdenas. \\"Race and ethnic inequality in health and health care in Colombia.\\" https://www.repository.fedesarrollo.org.co/bitstream/handle/11445/811/WP_2005_No_29.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y (2005). Researchers have found that the adult AfroColombian population is less likely to be described as being in good health compared to the rest of the population. They are also more likely to report that they are sick and are dealing with chronic issues. This population is also less likely to obtain treatment if they are sick. Nevertheless, when they do look for medical treatment, they tend to receive it in the same numbers as non-AfroColombians. These results are not just explained by disadvantages in socioeconomic status, health insurances, or educational level, but by the discrimination that AfroColombians experience in their daily lives. Even when health insurance is given for free, AfroColombians are far less likely to be enrolled and this can be explained by structural and internalized discrimination.Dedios, Mar√≠a C. \\"Poor Health Outcomes amongst AfroColombians Are Driven by Discrimination as Well as Economic Disadvantage.\\" LSE Latin America and the Caribbean, 1 Nov. 2017, https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/latamcaribbean/2017/10/31/poor-health-outcomes- amongst-afro-colombians-are-driven-by-discrimination-as-well-as-economic- disadvantage/.
