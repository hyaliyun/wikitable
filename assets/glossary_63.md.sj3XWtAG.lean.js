History  In the Fall of 2004, two social work students from the Columbia University School of Social Work began generating interest for a Columbia-wide conference on multidisciplinary perspectives on issues pertaining to international development. This resulted in the 2005 conference titled \\"Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Armed Conflict and Forced Migration\\". The conference was coordinated by a multidisciplinary team of student leaders from the Columbia University School of Social Work, Columbia University Law School, and the Mailman School of Public Health. This collaboration led to the inception of the Columbia University Partnership for International Development. Student representatives across the ten Columbia graduate schools were recruited in order to establish an academic partnership across fields that would continue to inform their work as they became professionals. The underlying hypothesis of this assumption was that the experience would better equip students to develop and implement effective, innovative, and holistic approaches to challenges faced in international development. Within a year, CUPID organized twelve multidisciplinary forums, co-sponsored six events, facilitated a conference on \\"Urbanization in the Developing World\\", sent five students to Central America as part of a multidisciplinary community development team, and coordinated 20 internships with the United Nations Development Programme. Influential organizations that helped found the Columbia Partnership for International Development included: The Earth Institute, The Africa Institute, The Columbia Alumni Association, The President and Provost's Student Event Fund, and the Open Society Foundations.  Activities  = Online Journal = The CUPID Online Journal is a creative space for students to publish original poetry, photographs, scholarly articles, blog-style posts, opinion pieces and field notes pertaining to international development. = Development Dialogues = Monthly events hosted by various Columbia graduate schools and colleges on rotation with the purpose of encouraging collective awareness, understanding and action. The Development Dialogues are informal and stimulating conversations regarding contemporary issues.

The Mojave Audio MA300; a multi polar- pattern, large diaphragm valve condenser microphone. History Microphones have been in use since the early telephone technology of the mid 1800s but achieved higher sound quality in the 1920s with the first double-button carbon mics made by Western Electric. The 387 model, with its 0.0017 inch thick gold- sputtered diaphragm, was the best of these early designs. It was followed by the improved model 600 in the early 1930s, and the double-button became recognised worldwide as a standard in broadcasting. Vacuum tube or electronic valve amplifiers were first used to resolve microphone impedance and output problems. Bell Labs invented the condenser microphones in 1917 and this type of microphone went through many stages of improvement. Because of the invention of valve amplifiers, the production of simple moving coil mics like the Western designed 630A \\"8 Ball\\" became possible. This dynamic microphone went on to become one of the mainstays of American microphone production. In this period valves were also then incorporated internally into microphones and valve microphones were hence commercially available. In the late 1920s, Dr. Harry F. Olson of RCA began development of the ribbon microphone, eventually using permanent magnets. In 1931, nine months after the introduction of Western's 618 dynamic, R.C.A. marketed a bi-directional ribbon microphone, the 44-A. The smooth, less sibilant sound of the ribbon and its elegant styling made it the standard for broadcasters into the 1940s. The design was updated with improved magnetic material in the mid thirties with the 44-B/-BX, which maintained its production until the mid 1950s. Ribbon microphones are still in demand today and come in many styles. In June 1948 the Neumann model U47 was introduced, and distributed by Telefunken. The U47 was the first condenser microphone switchable between cardioid and omni-directional pick-up patterns. It incorporated the highly successful 12-micron-thick M7 capsule and VF-14 tube amplifier, which was a metal-clad pre-World War II pentode changed to work as a triode. These microphones had evolved from the 1928 CMV3 \\"bottle\\" mic, followed by the CMV3A which had interchangeable condenser heads. This mic was notoriously made use of by Hitler at the Berlin Olympics and at Nazi party rallies, and was the state of the art in microphone technology at that time. In 1958 Neumann took over the sale of their own mics from Telefunken and made many small changes to the U47 design, but this mic perhaps more than any other embodies the valve or tube sound. The design was perishable so very few remain; therefore it has become the most sought after of studio microphones, although many clones and similar versions are now popular. Proliferation There are many reasons why valve microphones have become so important in today's recording and home studios; partly they are fashionable due to their early use by influential composers and musicians such as the Beatles, Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, etc. but also because the sound quality they reproduce has pleasing sonic qualities, even though more technically perfect reproduction is possible by transistor microphones which have less self-noise.

As well as his work to spread the practice of resuscitation, he was concerned to relieve poverty in east London. William Hawes, 1802 engraving Life Hawes was born at Islington, London, on 28 November 1736, and was educated at first by John Shield, and afterwards at St Paul's School, London. After passing some time with Mr. Robert Carsan, a medical practitioner of Vauxhall, he became assistant to a Mr. Dicks in the Strand and eventually succeeded him in his practice. About 1773 Hawes became well known as a campaigner for the possibility of resuscitating persons apparently dead from drowning, or other causes of asphyxia. For a year he gave a reward to anyone who brought to him, or his supporters, the body of a person who had been taken out of the River Thames insensible, within a reasonable time after immersion. The reward was paid whether the attempt to resuscitate proved successful or not. Thomas Cogan, who translated in 1773 an account of an Amsterdam society for the resuscitation of the apparently drowned, thought that Hawes should not pay all the rewards, and it was arranged in 1774 that he and Cogan should each bring fifteen friends to the Chapter coffee-house on Paternoster Row to consider further operations. This was done, and at the meeting the Humane Society was formed. Hawes became its registrar. Hawes was also physician to the London Dispensary. From 1791 he lived in Spital Square, and in 1793 worked to alleviate the distress which then was found among Spitalfields weavers. He died 5 December 1808. Works Hawes wrote the following works: * An Account of Dr. Goldsmith's Illness, 1774. Oliver Goldsmith had consulated Hawes as apothecary, but against his advice continued to self-medicate with Dr James's \\"fever powder\\". * An Examination of the Rev. John Wesley's Primitive Physic, 1776; 3rd ed. 1780. * An Address on Premature Death and Premature Interment, 1777. * An Address to the Public on the Dangerous Custom of laying out persons as soon as Respiration ceases, with a Reply by W. Renwick, and Observations on that Reply, 1778. * An Address to the Legislature on the importance of a Humane Society, 1781. * An Address to the King and Parliament of Great Britain on the important subject of preserving the Lives of its Inhabitants, 1782; 3rd ed., with Observations on the General Bills of Mortality, 1783. * The Transactions of the Royal Humane Society from 1774 to 1784, with an Appendix of Miscellaneous Observations on Suspended Animation to the year 1794. Family Hawes married Sarah Fox (1740‚Äì1814) in 1759, and they had nine children. They included: *Harriot (bap. 1760) *Sophia (bap. 1762, died 1828), married in 1790 Russell Scott (1761‚Äì1833), a nonconformist minister in Portsmouth and brother of Mary Scott. Their daughter Sophia Russell Scott married her first cousin John Edward Taylor, son of Mary Scott and founder of the Manchester Guardian; and her brother Russell (1810‚Äì1880) was father of C. P. Scott, editor of The Guardian. *The eldest son, Thomas (bap. 1765, died 1849), a magistrate, was partner with his brother Benjamin in the soapworks at the New Barge House, Lambeth. *Sarah (b. 1773) *William (b. 1774) *Benjamin (1770‚Äì1861), the father of Benjamin Hawes (1797‚Äì1862) and William Hawes (1805‚Äì1885). *Maria, or Mary Ann (b. 1782), married John Gurney.

Note the terminal on the top of the tube, used to power the keep-alive. A Sutton tube, or reflex klystron, is a type of vacuum tube used to generate microwaves. It is a low-power device used primarily for two purposes; one is to provide a tuneable low-power frequency source for the local oscillators in receiver circuits, and the other, with minor modifications, as a switch that could turn on and off another microwave source. The second use, sometimes known as a soft Sutton tube or rhumbatron switch, was a key component in the development of microwave radar by Britain during World War II. Microwave switches of all designs, including these, are more generally known as T/R tubes or T/R cells. The Sutton tube is named for one of its inventors, Robert Sutton, an expert in vacuum tube design. The original klystron designs had been developed in the late 1930s in the US, and Sutton was asked to develop a tuneable version. He developed the first models in late 1940 while working at the Admiralty Signals and Radar Establishment. Sutton tubes were widely used in a variety of forms during World War II and through the 1960s. Their role has since been taken over by solid state devices like the Gunn diode, which started to become available in the 1970s. \\"Rhumbatron\\" refers to the resonant cavity design that was part of many klystrons, referring to the rhumba because of the dance-like motion of the electrons. Basic klystron concept In a two-cavity klystron, the electrons \\"bunch up\\" as they move between the cavities, re-creating the original signal. Klystrons share the basic concept that the microwave output is generated by progressively accelerating then slowing electrons in an open space surrounded by a resonant cavity. The easiest klystron designs to understand have two cavities. The first cavity is connected to a source signal, and is designed to resonate at the desired frequency, filling its interior with an oscillating electric field. The cavity's dimensions are a function of the wavelength, most are flat cylinders the shape of a hockey puck of varying sizes. A hole is drilled through the middle, at the center of the \\"puck\\". A stream of electrons fired from an electron gun passes through the hole, and the varying field causes them to either accelerate or decelerate as they pass. Beyond the cavity the accelerated electrons catch up to the decelerated ones, causing the electrons to bunch up in the stream. This causes the stream to re-create the original signal's pattern in the density of the electrons. This area of the tube has to be fairly long to allow time for this process to complete. The electrons then pass through a second cavity, similar to the first. As they pass, the bunches cause a varying electric field to be induced in the cavity, re-creating the original signal but at much higher current. A tap point on this cavity provides the amplified microwave output. Local oscillators The reflex klystron essentially folds the two-cavity design in half, using two opposing accelerating fields. The introduction of the cavity magnetron caused a revolution in radar design, generating large amounts of power from a compact and easy-to-build device. However, it also required several additional developments before it could be used. Among these was a suitable local oscillator about 45 MHz different than the transmitter signal, which fed the intermediate frequency section of the receiver circuits. The problem was that the magnetron's frequency drifted as it warmed and cooled, enough that some sort of tuneable microwave source was needed whose frequency could be adjusted to match. A second magnetron would not work, they would not drift in sync.\\"Magnetron Theory of Operation\\", p. 3. As the receiver circuit requires only very little output power, the klystron, first introduced only two years earlier, was a natural choice. Sutton, a well-known expert in tube design, was asked if he could provide a version that could be tuned across the same range as the magnetron's drift. An initial model available in 1940 allowed tuning with some effort. While it worked, it was not suitable for an operational system. Sutton and Thompson continued working on the problem, and delivered a solution in October 1940. Thompson named it for Sutton, while Sutton referred to it as the Thompson Tube.Reg Batt, \\"The Radar Army: Winning the War of the Airwaves\\", Hale, 1991, p. 61. The former stuck. Their advance was to use a single resonator and clever physical arrangement to provide the same effect as two cavities. He did this by placing a second electrode at the far end of the tube, the \\"reflector\\" or \\"repeller\\", which caused the electrons to turn around and start flowing back toward the gun, similar to the Barkhausen‚ÄìKurz tube. By changing the voltage of the reflector relative to the gun, the speed of the electrons when they reached the cavity the second time could be adjusted, within limits. The frequency was a function of the velocity of the electrons, providing the tuning function. This modification effectively folded the klystron in half, with most of the \\"action\\" at the center of the tube where the input and output from the single cavity were located. Furthermore, only the interior of the cavity was inside the tube, the outer surface was in the form of a metal shell wrapped around the tube. Larger changes to the frequency could be made by replacing the outer shell, and this also provided a convenient location for mounting. Unfortunately, the system needed two high- voltage power supplies, one for the initial acceleration in the gun, and a second between the gun and the reflector. And, due to the way it worked, the system was generally limited to milliwatts of power. Soft Sutton tube One of the advantages of using microwaves for radar is that the size of an antenna is based on the wavelength of the signal, and shorter wavelengths thus require much smaller antennas. This was vitally important for airborne radar systems. German aircraft, using longer wavelengths, required enormous antennas that slowed the aircraft between 25 and 50 km/h due to drag.Jean-Denis G.G. Lepage, \\"Aircraft of the Luftwaffe, 1935-1945\\", McFarland, 2009, p. 61. Microwaves required antennas only a few centimetres long, and could easily fit within the aircraft nose. This advantage was offset by the lack of a switching system to allow a single antenna to act as both a transmitter and receiver. This is not always a major problem; the Chain Home system made do with two sets of antennas, as did early airborne radars like the Mk. IV. In 1940 Bernard Lovell developed a solution for microwave radar by placing two sets of dipoles in front of a common parabolic dish and placing a disk of metal foil between them. However, this was not terribly successful, and the crystal diodes used as detectors frequently burned out as the signal bled through or around the disk. A solution using two spark gap tubes was also used, but was less than ideal. A better solution was suggested by Arthur H. Cooke of the Clarendon Laboratory, and production development was taken up by H.W.B. Skinner along with A.G. Ward and A.T. Starr at the Telecommunications Research Establishment. They took a Sutton tube and disconnected the electron gun and reflector, leaving just the cavity. This was filled with a dilute gas, initially helium or hydrogen, but eventually settling on a tiny amount of water vapour and argon. When the transmission signal was seen on the input, the gas would rapidly ionize (helped by a heater coil or radium).Robert Buderi, \\"The Invention That Changed the World\\", Touchstone, 1998, p.118. The free electrons in the plasma presented an almost perfect impedance source, blocking the signal from flowing to the output. As soon as the transmission stopped, the gas de-ionized and the impedance disappeared very rapidly. The tiny echoes caused by reflections from the target, arriving microseconds later, were far too small to cause the ionization, and allowed the signal to reach the output. The usable soft Sutton tube arrived in March 1941, and was put into production as the CV43. It was first used as part of the AI Mk. VII radar, the first production microwave radar for aircraft. The system was widely used from then on, appearing in almost all airborne microwave radars, including the H2S radar and ASV Mark III radar. Post-war intelligence revealed that the Germans were baffled by the purpose of the soft Sutton tube. Several examples fell into their hands, notably in the Rotterdam Ger√§t, an H2S that was captured in fairly complete form in February 1943. Interviews with German radar engineers after the war demonstrated that they could not understand the purpose of the unpowered tube. The soft Sutton tube was used in a circuit known as a \\"T/R switch\\" (or many variations on that theme). Other spark tubes had been used for this purpose, in a design known as the \\"Branch-Duplexer\\". This consisted of two short lengths of waveguide about 1/4 of a wavelength, both of which turned on when the signal arrived. Because of the geometry of the layout, the two paths resulted in a reflection of the signal.Christian Wolff, \\"Branch- Duplexer\\" Sutton tubes were used in a simpler design known as the \\"shunt branching circuit\\", which was T shaped with the transmitter and antenna located at either end of the horizontal portion of the T, and the receiver at the end of the vertical portion. By locating the Sutton tube at the right location along the waveguide to the receiver, the same effect as the branch-duplexer could be arranged.C.G. Montgomery, \\"Microwave Duplexers\\", MITA.L.

It lies in the parish of Altleiningen in the county of Bad Durkheim in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.  Location  Whilst the parish of Altleiningen lies at 300 metres above sea level along the length of the valley of the Eckbach, the hill castle was built on the domed summit of a hill, about 400 metres high, that rises above the left bank of the Eckbach.  History  The name, like that of its sister castle, Neuleiningen 5 kilometres northeast, is derived from the Frankish noble family of Leiningen, who used to rule the territory of the Leiningerland. The mighty hill fortress is built on rocks and was probably established around 1100 to 1110 by the Count of Leiningen, Emich I, and his son, Emich II, under the name of Leiningen Castle. The overall castle site, which follows the shape of the hilltop, has a triangular ground plan. Of the original caste, only a few wall remains on the west side have survived. The outer ward was surrounded by its own moat and by a main ditch hewn out of the rock, over which there was a drawbridge that separated it from the actual castle. Two kilometres to the south of the castle, Emich II founded H√∂ningen Abbey around 1120. During the peasants' uprising in 1525 the castle suffered its first destruction. The present site is based on its rebuilding in the Renaissance style, beginning in 1528, by counts Cuno II, Philip I, Louis and John Casimir. Its reconstruction required the local farmers to render socage. Around 1600 a gallery was driven deep into the rock below the castle in order to obtain a supply of water. The 20-Pipe Well is today the biggest source of water for the Eckbach. In 1690 the castle was destroyed again, this time for good, during the War of the Palatine Succession by French troops. Thereafter it was used as a quarry until the mid-19th century when this was banned by the government of the Kingdom of Bavaria. Until 1933 the terrain remained in the hands of the counts of Leiningen (Leiningen-Westerburg-Altleiningen line), before it was procured by the county of Frankenthal. In 1962 the ruins were listed and the schloss wing rebuilt in the six years that followed. In doing so they incorporated the wall remains on the western side.  Present usage  = Leisure = Swimming pool in the old moat and the ruins of the palas In 1968 a youth hostel was integrated into the partially rebuilt castle. This was completely modernized between 1998 and 2000. As part of this renovation the castle was given a gable roof again; previously it had had a flat, 1960s-style roof. The great hall (Rittersaal) is used as a dining room; another guest room is the Burgsch√§nke pub with its summer terrace. The main moat has been converted into a public open air swimming pool. = Culture = The covered \\"hall of honour\\" (Ehrenhalle), a room separated from the arcades to the courtyard, has around 250 visitor seats. Since 1980 the amateur dramatics group, the Altleiningen Castle Players (Burgspiele Altleiningen) have offered a summer programme of theatre productions. These include both classical as well as modern productions, mostly with a historic theme, something that matches the ambience. = Nature = In the vaults of the castle cellars is the largest colony of wild bats in Germany. For biotope conservation reasons, visitors are not allowed access.  Literature  * J√ºrgen Keddigkeit, Alexander Thon, Karl Scheurer Rolf √úbel: Pf√§lzisches Burgenlexikon, Vol. 1: A-E. 2nd edition.

(Fresco at the \\"Belvedere\\", c.1837) Eliezer and Rebecca at the Well Carl Gottlieb Peschel (31 March 1798, Dresden ‚Äì 3 July 1879, Dresden) was a German painter. He was a member of the Nazarene movement.<  Biography  Beginning in 1812, he became a student at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. When Carl Christian Vogel von Vogelstein was commissioned to paint the ceilings at the Schloss Pillnitz, Peschel worked as his assistant. He inherited part of his father's military pension and used the money to finance a study trip to Rome with his friend Adolf Zimmermann in 1825-1826. When he returned home, he supported himself by giving drawing lessons and painting snuff cans. After the Saxon Art Association bought his painting Eliezer and Rebecca at the Well, he was able to give full attention to his work. He was commissioned to complete the frescoes at the H√§rtel House in Leipzig after Bonaventura Genelli had gotten into several quarrels and walked off the job. From 1836 to 1838, he was engaged by Johann Gottlob von Quandt to paint frescoes, depicting episodes from the works of Goethe, at his manor \\"Belvedere\\" in the Sch√∂nfeld Upland. In 1837, he became a teacher at the Dresden Academy, replacing Christian Ernst St√∂lzel, and was appointed a professor in 1846. He became a member of the Academic Council there in 1859. He retired in 1877. Although he originally preferred motifs from the Old Testament, from 1850 on his paintings were more often related to the New Testament. A street in Dresden has been named the \\"Peschelstrasse\\" in his honor.  Illustrations  * In: ABC-Buch f√ºr kleine und gro√üe Kinder / gezeichnet von Dresdner K√ºnstlern.

Description Body length female 4-5.5 mm; male 3.3‚Äì4 mm. The apophysis on the lateral tibia is approximately half the length of the cymbium, the median apophysis has 2 processes, pointing against towards other at right angles. The epigyne has a process in anterior epigynal region, wider than long. The prosoma is light brown, with 2-4 dark stripes along its length, the legs are uniformly light brown, as is the opisthosoma. Distribution Ozyptil trux has a Palearctic distribution but has been introduced to Canada. In Great Britain it is widespread but is commoner in the north and west. It was known in Canada from a single female collected near Montreal which was designated as the holotype of a new species Oxyptila belma by Gertsch, subsequent comparisons with specimens of O. trux collected in England showed that the Canadian specimen was the same species. It may have been accidentally introduced to the site it was collected from and since it was not subsequently recorded may not have become established. Habitat and ecology Ozyptil trux has a catholic habitat niche, being found in all types of wet and dry grassland, heath and woodland, from sea level to 350 m in southern Scotland. Adults may occur throughout the year although the spider may spend much of the season inactive or within the upper zone of the vegetation thus not being liable to capture. Data from the British Arachnological Society shows that adults have been recorded throughout the year, with males recorded from February to November, but peaking in the late spring and early summer.

Fillingham flew 120 different types of aircraft during his career including all variants of the de Havilland Mosquito. Early life Fillingham was born in 1914 as William Patrick Ingram Fillingham in Sutton Coldfield and he was educated at Worksop College and the de Havilland Aeronautical Technical School. Fillingham learned to fly with the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve at Perth in Scotland, he flew his first solo in February 1937. He graduated from the de Havilland technical school in 1939 as an aeronautical engineer and joined the parent company de Havilland as a test pilot. Wartime test pilot Mosquito in 1943 With the start of the Second World War the company had an increase in aircraft production and by April 1940 Fillingham was test flying 150 de Havilland Tiger Moth biplane trainers a month. By September 1942 he was the chief production test pilot flying new de Havilland Mosquito twin-engine light bombers. In 1943 he went to the de Havilland subsidiaries in Toronto and Sydney to advise them how to test fly the Mosquito, during his stay in Canada he demonstrated the Mosquito at a number of Canadian air bases and also to the United States Army Air Force. With production of the Mosquito in England increased to a five a day Fillingham flew a record 2,200 flights in the Mosquito. As well as the Mosquito he also flew the twin-engined De Havilland Hornet, at the time the fastest propeller aircraft in the world. Peacetime test pilot With the end of the war Fillingham still had plenty to do as de Havilland produced the Dove and Heron commercial transports. He flew the prototype de Havilland Canada Chipmunk in Canada in 1946.Jackson 1987, p. 534 Military aircraft were still produced and as well as the Dove and Heron, Fillingham is also recorded as flying in the same month de Havilland Vampire jet fighters, de Havilland Canada Chipmunk trainers and Mosquitos. As the company moved into the 1950s Fillingham test flew the four-engined de Havilland Comet airliner and then the three-engine de Havilland Trident airliner. In 1972 he delivered a Trident to China, the first western jet to be imported. By 1975 De Havilland had become Hawker Siddeley Aviation and Fillingham was Deputy Chief Test Pilot when he decided to retire. His last few flying years for Hawker Siddeley he flew the Hawker Siddeley HS.125 as well as display flying the then last flying Mosquito. Fillingham had 11,450 hours on 120 different aircraft types during his career. In 1970 he was awarded a Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air. Family life and leisure Fillingham had married Sonja Couper in 1952 and they had a daughter and a son. As well as his duties as a test pilot Fillingham also flew in air races winning the Goodyear Trophy in 1952 and the King's Cup in 1953 flying a de Havilland Canada Chipmunk. Fillingham owned a number of vintage motor cars and took part in three Monte Carlo Rallies. Fillingham died on 17 July 2003 aged 89.

Geography  The hill castle is located in the Upper Mundat Forest about three kilometres west of the village of Oberotterbach on the 503-metre-high Schlossberg hill. One kilometre away are the Hohe Derst (561 m) to the northwest and Hohe Kopf (497 m) to the south. The Otterbach, a left tributary of the River Rhine, rises on the northeastern slopes of the Schlossberg, below the castle.  History  The castle was possibly first mentioned in 1151 as an imperial castle of the Hohenstaufen emperors which was managed by the ministerialis, Landolfo de Gudenburc, or it may have been connected with Ulrich of Guttenberg (Udelricus de Gudenburhc) who gifted it in 1174 to Eusserthal Abbey. The first confirmed record occurs in 1246 when Isengard of Falkenstein, on behalf of her husband, the imperial steward (Reichstruchsess), Philip I of Falkenstein, transferred the castle to King Conrad IV.Rolf √úbel: Guttenberg in Pf√§lzisches Burgen- Lexikon II F‚ÄìH, p. 253, Kaiserslautern, 2002, . In 1317, half of the castle was enfeoffed to the counts of Leiningen, whilst the other half went, a little later, to Electoral Palatinate. In the division of the Palatinate of 1410 the castle was allocated to Duke Stephen of Palatinate-Simmern-Zweibr√ºcken. The Leiningens lost their share in 1463 when it went via the Hanau-Lichtenbergs to the Wittelsbach branch of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. In 1525, during the German Peasants' War Guttenberg Castle was destroyed by a Lorraine peasant mob. The ruins were never rebuilt and its associated office or Amt moved to D√∂rrenbach. With the extinction of the Heidelberg line in 1559, Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken also inherited the other half of the Barony of Guttenberg including the related part of the ruined castle. From 1680 to 1697 the region was under French hegemony as part of the successes achieved under France's policy of reunionspolitik. From 1792 to 1815 the region was part of the First French Republic and was assigned to the d√©partement du Bas-Rhin (Department of Lower Rhine). In November 1815 the area between the rivers Lauter and Queich, including the ruins of Guttenberg, came under the sovereignty of the Empire of Austria as a result of the agreements reached in the Second Treaty of Paris. Finally in April 1816 the region of the Palatinate was surrendered in the Treaty of Munich to the Kingdom of Bavaria, becoming the Circle of the Rhine. After the end of the Second World War the site became the property of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, but was under French administration from 1949 to 1986. From 1989 to 1995 safety measures were implemented with the support of the Advisory Board for the Preservation of the Mundat Forest (Kuratoriums zu Erhaltung des Mundatwaldes).

It was to do so by establishing specific deadlines for environmental reviews, which sometimes go on so long that they can delay a project for years. The bill passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Responsibly And Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2013 or the RAPID Act would state as the purpose of this Act to establish procedures to streamline, increase the efficiency of, and enhance coordination of agency administration of the regulatory review, environmental decision making, and permitting process for major actions that are construction activities undertaken, reviewed, or funded by federal agencies. The bill would authorize a project sponsor, upon the request of a lead agency (the agency responsible preparing the environmental document), to prepare any document for environmental review required in support of, or for approval of, such an activity if such agency furnishes oversight and independently evaluates, approves, and adopts such document prior to taking action or making any approval based on such document. Defines \\"environmental review\\" as federal agency procedures for preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS), environmental assessment (EA), categorical exclusion, or other document under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The bill would prohibit requiring more than one EIS and one EA for a project, except for supplemental environmental documents prepared under NEPA or environmental documents prepared pursuant to a court order. Requires the lead agency to prepare the EIS or EA, except as otherwise provided by law. Prohibits, after the lead agency issues a record of decision, any federal agency responsible for making any approval for a project from relying on a document other than the environmental document prepared by the lead agency. The bill would allow the lead agency, upon the request of a project sponsor, to: (1) adopt, use, or rely upon secondary and cumulative impact analyses included in documents prepared under NEPA for projects in the same geographic area if such documents are pertinent to the NEPA decision for the project under review; and (2) adopt a document that has been prepared for a project under state laws as the EIS or EA for the project if such laws provide environmental protection and opportunities for public involvement that are substantially equivalent to NEPA. Requires the lead agency to publish a supplement to the state document if: (1) a significant change has been made to the project that is relevant for purposes of environmental review, or (2) there have been significant changes in circumstances or availability of information relevant to such review. Requires a lead agency to issue its record of decision or finding of no significant impact based upon such adopted document. The bill would authorize a lead agency to adopt for a project an environmental document for a similar project that is in geographical proximity and that was subject to environmental review or similar state procedures within the preceding five years if the agency determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that the projects will have similar environmental impacts. The bill would require the lead agency to invite and designate as a participating agency in the preparation of an environmental document for a project any federal agency that is required to adopt such document. Requires such an agency to collaborate on the preparation of such document unless it informs the lead agency that it has no jurisdiction, authority, expertise, or information with respect to, and does not intend to submit comments on, the project. Precludes any agency that declines to participate from submitting comments on such document or taking measures to oppose any permit, license, or approval related to that project based on the environmental review. Prohibits the lead agency from acting upon, responding to, or including in any document prepared under NEPA any comment submitted by a participating agency that concerns matters outside of such agency's authority and expertise. The bill would require federal agencies to carry out: (1) obligations under other applicable laws concurrently and in conjunction with the review required under NEPA; and (2) such rules, policies, and procedures as may be reasonably necessary to enable such agency to ensure the completion of the environmental review and environmental decision making process in a timely, coordinated, and environmentally responsible manner. The bill would set forth provisions concerning requirements for initiating and completing environmental review for a project, including requirements for: (1) determining the range of alternatives to be considered; (2) methodologies for analyzing such alternatives, including potential effects on employment; (3) a plan for coordinating public and agency participation in the review; (4) periods for public and agency comments on draft EISs; and (5) a schedule for completing the review. Requires all participating agencies to comply with such schedule. The bill would establish: (1) for projects requiring preparation of an EA, a one-year deadline for issuing a finding of no significant impact or a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS; and (2) for projects requiring preparation of an EIS, a two-year deadline for completing the EIS. Sets forth conditions for extensions. The bill would set forth deadlines for decisions required under any other federal law relating to the undertaking of a project being reviewed under NEPA. Deems: (1) a project to be approved in the event that a federal agency fails to approve or otherwise act upon a permit, license, or other similar application for approval related to a project within such deadlines, and (2) such approval to be final agency action that may not be reversed by an agency. The bill would prescribe responsibilities of the lead agency and the participating agencies to work cooperatively to identify and resolve issues that could delay completion of the environmental review or could result in denial of any approvals required for the project under applicable laws. The bill would require the head of each federal agency to report annually on: (1) the projects for which the agency initiated preparation of an EIS or EA; (2) the projects for which the agency issued a record of decision or a finding of no significant impact and the length of time it took the agency to complete the environmental review for each such project; and (3) the filing and resolution of any lawsuits against the agency seeking judicial review of a permit, license, or approval issued by the agency for an action subject to NEPA. The bill would set forth limitations to claims arising under federal law seeking judicial review of a permit, license, or approval issued by a federal agency for an action subject to NEPA. The bill would prohibit this Act from being construed to supersede, amend, or modify specified regulations concerning environmental review of transportation projects. The bill would require the Council on Environmental Quality and each federal agency to amend NEPA implementing regulations to implement the provisions of this Act. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on July 31, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 2641 would amend the Administrative Procedures Act, the law that governs how federal agencies propose and establish regulations. Specifically, the bill would aim to expedite the review process required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for construction projects that are partly or fully financed with federal funds or require permits or approvals from federal regulatory agencies. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing this legislation would cost $5 million over the next five years, assuming the availability of appropriated funds, as federal agencies would incur additional administrative costs to meet the new requirements imposed by H.R. 2641. Additional federal expenditures also would occur if agencies face legal challenges as a result of the bill‚Äôs implementation. Over time, we expect that the bill could reduce the time needed to commence and complete some construction projects financed with federal funds. Expediting the time required to start such projects would generally reduce the total costs to complete them, but CBO has no basis for estimating the timing or magnitude of such savings. Enacting H.R. 2641 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 2641 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Responsibly And Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 10, 2013 by Rep. Tom Marino (R, PA-10). It was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary and the United States House Committee on Natural Resources. On March 6, 2014, the House voted 229-179 to pass the bill. President Barack Obama threatened to veto the bill. Debate and discussion Arguing in favor of the bill, Republicans said that the bill does not require environmental reviews to approve projects, just that the reviews be done in a reasonable time frame. Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) said that the bill \\"sets hard deadlines, including an 18-month maximum deadline for an environmental assessment, and a 36-month maximum deadline for an environmental impact statement.\\" Goodlatte argued that the bill would be good for the economy because it would speed up new construction projects. The United States Chamber of Commerce strongly supported the bill, saying that \\"every year that major projects are stalled or cancelled because of a dysfunctional permitting process and a system that allows limitless challenges by opponents of development, millions of jobs are not created.\\" Arguing against the bill, some Democrats said that the deadlines would lead to \\"the possibility that projects will be approved too quickly, which could lead to legal and environmental problems, and more delays, down the road.\\" Opponents, like Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-FL), also argued that environmental reviews were not the main cause of delays in new construction projects according to research from the Congressional Research Service.

The film stars Nate Parker as Rome and Lindsey Haun as Jewel. The 2008 re-release had modest box office results and mostly negative critical commentary. Plot Compton-native Rome (Nate Parker) is the son of Reverend Q (Cleavant Derricks) and yearns for Jewel (Lindsey Haun), the daughter of Los Angeles Mayor Capps (John Rubinstein) who lives in Beverly Hills. Using reworked dialogue from the play such as \\"deep inside I‚Äôm tender/sweeter than Splenda/and if you must know the truth/my heart's not bulletproof\\" Rome woos Jewel, despite his father's wishes that he avoid upper-class white women after he meets her at her sweet 16 party. It is love-at-first-sight over a shared rap discourse and the duo have a quick wedding in Las Vegas. After a tragic ending befalls the teens, the fathers come to a realization that color should not distinguish humanity.

Nathan Lee of The New York Times said the film was \\"a retrograde, thoroughly schematic conflict between rich, snooty white kids and working- class blacks\\". Robert Koehler, writing for Variety, said it was a \\"tone-deaf and culturally silly adaptation, which pits Beverly Hills whites against Compton blacks\\". Lee also indicated that the divisiveness was a bit contrived and that the film breathes life into the socioeconomic consideration it hopes to fight.

It is a user-driven programme under civil control, which will notably encompass the launch of six families of dedicated, EU-owned earth observation satellites and instruments ‚Äì the so-called Sentinels ‚Äì and the ramp-up of the 6 Copernicus Services in the fields of atmosphere-, marine- and land-monitoring, climate change, emergency management and security. Copernicus data and services are available on a full, open and free-of charge basis to users, including EU institutions, Member States' authorities, the private sector for the development of commercial downstream applications and services, international partners, the global scientific community, and interested citizens. It provides multi temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar images with a temporal gap of 12 days. Data products can be used for SAR Interferometry applications. Data downloads can be done through sentinel data hub . Sentinel 2 mission outputs are also available in the same data hub. Mission history =Pre-launch= Sentinel-1A arrived at its launch site in Kourou, French Guiana on 25 February 2014,Thales Alenia Space. Sentinel 1A arrives at launch site in French Guiana ahead of its launch which was at the time planned for 28 March. =Launch= Sentinel-1A was launched on 3 April 2014 by a Soyuz rocket at 21:02:31 GMT (23:02:31 CEST). The first stage separated 118 seconds later, followed by the fairing (209 s), second stage (287 s) and the upper assembly (526 s).Sentinel-1A Launch Timeline ‚Äì ESA blog post After a 617-second burn, the Fregat upper stage delivered Sentinel into a Sun-synchronous orbit at 693 km altitude. The satellite separated from the upper stage 23 min 29 s after liftoff. =Orbital operation= At 09:43 and at 11:21 on 5 April 2014 ACRIMSAT was rated as having a high risk of collision (<20m) with the newly launched Sentinel-1A. A 39-second burn of Sentinel-1A during LEOP successfully avoided the collision. Preliminary data, taken during commissioning, demonstrated the versatility and capability of the imagery produced by Sentinel-1A even before the radar system is fully calibrated. Mapping sea ice to ensure the safe passage of marine vessels, providing data to validate ice loss models and determining the difference between land used for forest, agriculture and urban areas. Data became available to all system users on 6 October 2014, marking the beginning of Sentinel-1A operational life. Copernicus data and services as provided by the Sentinel-satellites and Copernicus services are available on a full, open and free-of-charge basis. = European Data Relay System test = The satellite was used as part of a in-orbit verification of the ESA European Data Relay System. In 2014, data from the Sentinel-1A satellite in LEO was transmitted via an optical link to the Alphasat in GEO and then relayed to a ground station using a Ka band downlink. = Incidents = On 31 August 2016, ESA announced they had discovered that a solar panel on the Copernicus Sentinel-1A satellite had been hit by a millimetre-size particle in orbit on 23 August. Thanks to onboard cameras, ground controllers were able to identify the affected area. The satellite's routine operations didn't seem to be altered by the impact. As of 2200 UTC on 7 September 2016, the JSpOC has identified 5 pieces of small debris in the vicinity of Sentinel-1A (SCC# 39634), which they believe are the result of the small particle impact identified by ESA on 23 August.

He saved the public buildings of Santa Fe, including the governor's house, when the city was flooded. His government paid great attention to the regulation and punishment of crimes in New Mexico, which were especially abundant in Albuquerque and Santa Fe. He also had to fight the Comanches, who frequently attacked the population of northern New Mexico. He tried to make a peace treaty with them, but it failed when the Comanches disobeyed the treaty, and he established a better defense system in New Mexico. Governor of colonial New Mexico = Justice issues = The Palace of the Governors. Mendinueta became governor and captain-general of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico province in 1767.New Mexico Commission of Public Records ‚Äì New Mexico Governors Under the Administration of the Spanish Crown A Forgotten Kingdom: The Spanish Frontier in Colorado and New Mexico, 1540-1821: Chapter X. New Mexico's Last Years of Freedom. Posted on BLM Cultural Resources Series (Colorado: No. 29). Retrieved March 5, 2014, to 23: 47 pm. In October 1767, the rising Santa Fe River caused a flood in the town. Mendinueta called on the residents to build retaining walls between the riverbed and the pueblo to protect public buildings. Afterwards, the Palace of the Governors remained unharmed in subsequent floods. In November 1767, Mendinueta established a law to regulate the hardest crimes in order to set an example. In addition, In early 1768 Mendinueta sent orders to Francisco Trebol Navarro (alcalde mayor of the city of Albuquerque) and Felipe Tafoya (alcalde mayor of Santa Fe) that they punish crimes taking place in their cities (gambling, concubinage, theft, prostitution, etc.) or else be fired. Indeed, Mendinueta considered Albuquerque to be one of the most dangerous places in New Mexico. In January 1768, Mendinueta was named a captain, so he led the Spanish troops that would participate in a military campaign against indigenous peoples. However, Mendinueta did not support all the requests from the residents of New Mexico. For example, he refused the citizens' request to replace Trebol as mayor of Albuquerque because they felt Trebol was incompetent. Indeed, during his administration, the crime rate increased in Albuquerque. Mendinueta normally worked in civil cases. In the rural society of New Mexico, most of the cases were related to land and livestock. Many of the cases that the governor had to face were ones in which the defendants were Spanish persons who tried to incite the natives to, for example, attack other indigenous villages, something intolerable to Mendinueta and which led hid to punish the defendants. = Troubles with the Comanches = In the late 1760s, the Comanches traveled to the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, north of Taos, where, together with the Utes, they attacked the San Luis Valley, the Rio Grande area, and Santa Fe. To protect those lands, Mendinueta established the Cerro de San Antonio, just north of Ojo Caliente, in May 1768. The new garrison consisted of fifty men, which the governor considered to be enough to drive away the Comanches. However, they were not successful. Therefore, Mendinueta established several new measures to strengthen the defense system in New Mexico. He proposed that all Spanish people of New Mexico settle in the most populated places of the province so that they could repel the attacks of the invaders, instead of along the Rio Grande Valley, a place vulnerable to attack, or in small towns and private ranches, away from the protected major cities. According to him, the Spanish settlements should be designed like the villages of Pueblo Amerindians, which were much more defensible than individual farms. This proposal faced against the traditional views that the Spanish and criollo residents in New Mexico had about their settlements. In addition, the governor said the Indians should leave their villages and settle in the cities inhabited by Spaniards, \\"for defensive purposes\\", where the Spaniards could also teach them the Spanish customs. However, according to Nicolas de Lafona, Santa Fe (which maintained the largest Spanish population, as it was one of the most important cities of the province), was attacked during the Spanish period. Mendinueta also conscripted the people of Spanish origin and the Christianized Amerindians as troops through a law that required the Spanish should exercise military service for eighteen days, regardless of where they lived. Each resident was required to join the army, taking a horse and carrying any weapon they had (either a spear, pike, or any other). However, the Spanish troops were always defeated by the Comanches. In addition, Madinueta could not stage a major military campaign against the Comanches and they continued to make depredations almost every day in northern New Mexico. Therefore, he ended up coming to terms with the Comanches to stop their attacks, signing a treaty with them in February 1771 in Taos. The treaty forbade Spaniards from moving into Comanche territory if they stopped attacking the Rio Grande Valley. The treaty was followed by good trade relations between the two groups. Mendinueta allowed the Comanches to return to the annual fair of Taos, from which they had been first banned in 1761 due to their behavior. This treaty did not last long because the Comanches preserved in their attacks in New Mexico until the second half of the 1780s. However, Oakah L. Jones notes that the Comanches did not continuously attack the Spanish and criollos throughout the 1770s. = Improvements in the defense of New Mexico = In 1772, following a visit of the Marquis of Rub√≠ in the 1760s, Mendinueta developed a line of presidios from the Gulf of California to Texas, passing through Arizona and New Mexico, to incorporate a better defense system into those territories. However, the new presidios in New Mexico had little impact because Santa Fe was already a presidio and so New Mexico was already more or less defended. A civilian militia was established at El Paso del Norte and the troops of this presidio were placed at Carrizal. In 1776, in order to enhance security in northern New Spain, the Spanish crown required a reorganization of all of the parts of the viceroyalty of New Spain, leading to a broad new policy for controlling the indigenous people in this province. A new administration subdivision named Provincias Internas (internal provinces) was established, to provide more autonomy for the frontier provinces including Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico and Alta California. Thus, New Mexico began to be more and more integrated into New Spain. Later in 1776, Mendinueta did not obey the viceroy of New Spain, lost his position as colonial governor, and became a military officer.

The themes and characters of the stories stem from Grimm's Fairytales (and other nursery rhymes and fairy tales). Each story is told from the perspective of a different fairytale character including Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Goldilocks. The series is set at the boarding school Grimm Academy in the country of Grimmlandia where these brave girls deal with life in middle school, are chosen by magic charms, and work to foil dastardly plots of the E.V.I.L. Society. Female characters =Cinderella= Cinderella, nicknamed Cinda, is the new girl at boarding school. She is a tomboy who loves the Grimmlandian sport of masketball and fears dancing and doesn't care much for fashion. After Cinda's mother died, her dad remarried to her stepmother, who had two spoiled children, Malorette and Odette, nicknamed the Steps. The Steps wreck havoc on Cinda's life as they manipulate, trick, blackmail, and attempt to frame Cinda for their evil plots. In the first book, Cinderella stays late, she starts her first day at Grimm Academy and meets her new BFFs : Red, Rapunzel, and Snow. She also meets the new heartthrob, Prince Awesome, who eventually wins Cinda's affections in Cinderella's story. Cinda's hurt and fear of the Steps leaves her too scared to report suspicious behavior, and it is not until she overhears a dark plot involving the E.V.I.L. Society, that she takes action. Cinda acquires a magic pair of glass slippers as a charm, which help her dance at Prince Awesome's ball and ultimately uncover a mapestry, which was hidden under the stones. Cinda and her friends use the mapestry to locate a magical treasure that is said to save the school in Rapunzel cuts loose (see below.). =Rapunzel= Rapunzel is a goth girl who is fearless‚Äîwell, except for her extreme fear of heights (acrophobia). Because of her acrophobia, she received special permission to live in the dungeon of Pink Tower instead of the dorms at the top. Rapunzel has extremely long hair that grows continuously, and very quickly despite her efforts to cut it, evidently because of a spell a witch cast on her. Her magical charm is an onyx carved comb that grows on her command. In the book Rapunzel cuts loose, she has a crush on Prince Perfect, until she finds out he only likes her because of her long, luxurious, and silky locks. She develops a love for Basil, a boy she met in the first grade and saved from a bully, making him the love interest in her story. She foils plans of the E.V.I.L. Society, seals the witch that raised her, and finds the magical treasure that is said to save the school. =Red Riding Hood= Red Riding Hood, nicknamed Red, is a girl who loves to act, but suffers from stage fright! Red is described as a girl with glitter-red-streaked, curly black hair, hooded by a red cape. To her friends' delight, she is a talented baker and the task of Snack-Maker magically chooses her. The second book, Red Riding Hood gets lost, is written from her perspective and introduces readers to her roommate Gretel(the heroine of the final book in the series). Red's magical charm is a brown wicker basket that can manifest anything that fits inside it, at her command. She has a horrible sense of direction, which sometimes makes her late for classes or meals. Wolfgang helps Red overcome her stage fright and the two develop a love interest in one another. =Snow White= Snow White, nicknamed Snow, is a shy and unlucky girl who enjoys keeping tidy and helps Cinda tidy her hearth in the first book, Cinderella stays late. Snow is described as a girl with pale skin, short ebony hair, and emerald green eyes. When Snow was less than a year old, her mother died and her father married her stepmother, Ms. Wicked. When Snow was six, her father died, leaving Snow with her mean stepmom who does not like her. Booted out of the castle by a distant heir, Ms. Wicked obtains a teaching job at Grimm Academy to make a living. The third book, Snow White lucks out, is written from Snow's point of view. Snow is allergic to all kinds of fruit and she fully believes in lucky charms. She wears a clover charm around her neck at all times. Like her mother, Snow is good at dancing and sewing, but she would have really liked to have learned from her mother. Snow has a crush on Prince Prince, the prince of her story. Her lucky charm is a golden tiara with 7 Turquoise jewels, the middle jewel can make her invisible if she presses it, like a button. =Sleeping Beauty= Briar Rose who just goes by her middle name, Rose, is a daredevil. According to her fairy tale, after her twelfth birthday, Rose must avoid all sharp objects. That is difficult at Grimm Academy, where enchanted items can also be dangerous. Rose will have to stay wide awake to keep out of trouble-and to find her magic charm. =Goldilocks= Goldilocks is a new girl and so eager to make friends at Grimm Academy, she is tempted to accept an invitation to join E.V.I.L. just to be included. Goldie ends up working as a double agent with Grimm Organization of Defense (G.O.O.D.) to help foil plans of the E.V.I.L. Society. She ultimately finds herself trying a break-in attempt past the three curfew guards: bears. =Snowflake= Snowflake is the heroine of the 7th book, Snowfalke freezes up, in which she is uncertain which fairy tale character she is and spends time searching her truth in books in the library. Just in case she might be a villain, Snowflake is chilly to her classmates to avoid hurting anyone. Her magic charm is a snowflake and her powers begin to cause some trouble. Ultimately, she must help fight Jack Frost and distinguish if Dragonbreath is good or evil. =Gretel= Gretel enjoys hiking and working on her hiking guide. The final book, Gretel pushes back, is from her perspective. She joins the quest for justice in a world where the E.V.I.L. Society must be stopped. Along the way, out in the woods, she finds a candy cottage. Her story inspires readers to explore their passions and treasure the unique dynamic of sibling relationships as she relates to her brother, Hansel, with both affection and bickering. Male characters =Prince Awesome= Prince Awesome is the prince of the Kingdom of Awesomeness, and the prince in Cinderella's story. He is described as a tall, handsome boy with wavy hair who is polite and concerned about doing what is right. He is first introduced in Cinderella stays late, in which Principal R introduces him along with Cinda as the two new kids and he invites everyone to his Ball. He does not appear to know about the E.V.I.L Society or what they are doing. He is on the masketball team and he has a crush on Cinda. =Wolfgang= Wolfgang seems to be a loner who hangs out in the Neverwood forest, where he supposedly shapeshifts into a wolf.

These effects on the prices of assets will in turn affect the economy.  Introduction  Policymakers should have a good understanding of how monetary policies transmit from a monetary tool into the goal. In order for monetary policies to have the desired effects on the economy policymakers should have an accurate assessment of the effects and timing of their policies. This is what the monetary transmission mechanism describes. There are several different channels through which a monetary policy can pass- through the economy. The key monetarists‚Äô objection for analyzing monetary policy effects was that it traditionally focused on only one asset price, the interest rate, rather than on many asset prices. There are three other categories of asset prices besides those on debt instruments that are regarded as critical channels through which monetary policy affects the economy. These are (1) stock market prices, (2) exchange rates and (3) real estate prices. Changes in these asset prices affect investment and consumption decisions of both firms and households and therefore central banks often use it as an instrument of monetary policy.  Stock price channel  Fluctuations in the stock market have important impacts on the economy, so also when influenced by Central Bank monetary policies. Transmission mechanisms involving the stock market have their results on the economy in three different ways. Firstly through their effects on investment in the stock market, for which stock prices are a determining factor. Secondly, changes in stock prices also have effects on a firm's balance sheet. Lastly, stock prices affect a households‚Äô wealth and liquidity by being directly related to the amount of financial wealth that a household holds. = Stock market effects on investment = A very well-known theory that describes how fluctuating stock prices affect the aggregate economy is Tobin's q theory. Tobin's q is defined as the total market value of firms divided by the replacement cost of capital. This means that if q > 1, the market price of the firm is higher than the replacement cost of capital and new plant equipment is cheap compared to the market value of firms. Under these circumstances, firms can issue stocks and get a high price for it, relatively to what it costs to buy the facilities and equipment that they need. As a result, investment spending will rise and firms buy this new equipment with only a small issue of stocks. Expansionary monetary policy (a lower interest rate) make stocks relatively more attractive than bonds. More demand for stocks will generally tend to drive up their prices. In terms of Tobin's q it means that q goes up, since the nominator increases. As was explained above, this raises the level of investment spending of firms, thereby leading to an increase in aggregate demand and a rise in output. This process can be described by the following schematic: ‚Üë M ‚Üí ‚Üë stock price ‚Üí ‚Üë q ‚Üí ‚Üë I ‚Üí ‚Üë Y. Alternatively, the effects of expansionary monetary policy can also be described as higher stock prices (again leading to more funds) lower the costs of capital (financing with stocks instead of bonds makes investment cheaper), and will rise both demand and aggregate output. In other words: ‚Üë M ‚Üí ‚Üë stock price ‚Üí ‚Üì c ‚Üí ‚Üë I ‚Üí ‚Üë Y. It can be argued by the same logic that the opposite holds for contractionary monetary policy. = Firm balance sheet effects = Following the same lines as described earlier, expansionary monetary policy causes stock prices to rise. When the stock price of a company increases, also the net worth of a company increases. This holds because the market capitalization of a company is equal to the total value of its outstanding stocks, which in turn provides a proxy for the company's net worth. Lending to companies with a lower net worth is more risky because these companies generally have less collateral and so the changes of potential losses are higher. This increases the risk of moral hazard and adverse selection problems for firms with a lower net worth. Therefore, a decline in net worth increases moral hazard and adverse selection problems and may lead to less lending to finance investment spending. This mechanism is called the firm balance-sheet effects because it works through the effect on stock prices on the firm's balance sheet. Expansionary policy rises the stock prices of the firm, which increases the net worth of the company. This decreased problems of moral hazard and adverse selection which means that funds to finance investments can rise. This again leads to a higher output of the economy. ‚Üë M ‚Üí ‚Üë stock price ‚Üí ‚Üë NW ‚Üí ‚Üë L ‚Üí ‚Üë I ‚Üí ‚Üë Y. = Household liquidity and wealth effects = Monetary policy can also operate through the link between money and stock prices. In general, durable products and housing are very illiquid assets because of asymmetric information (information on their quality can be very non-transparent). The higher the amount of financial assets, such as stocks, relative to a household's debt (in other words, the higher the amount of liquid assets), the lower the risk for financial distress. Consumers will then be less reluctant to purchase durable products and spend on residential and housing assets. This will again have a positive on aggregate demand and the output of the economy. ‚Üë M ‚Üí ‚Üë stock price ‚Üí ‚Üë financial assets ‚Üí ‚Üì financial distress ‚Üí ‚Üë Cdurables, ‚Üë H ‚Üí ‚Üë Y, where Cdurables is the consumption of durable goods and H is the spending on housing and residential assets. Similarly, it can be argued that when expansionary policy rises the stock prices, it automatically also rises the value of the financial wealth of a household and consumption will increase. This effect of stock prices is explained by Modigliani's model of life-cycle consumption theory. This theory states that an important component of consumer's lifetime resources are stocks and that stocks therefore are an important determinant for consumption. ‚Üë M ‚Üí ‚Üë stock price ‚Üí ‚Üë W ‚Üí ‚Üë C ‚Üí ‚Üë Y, where W is the financial wealth of a household.  Exchange rate channel  There are two main channels through which monetary policies that affect the exchange rate operate in the economy: first, and most important, through their effects on exports, and secondly through their effects on companies‚Äô balance sheets. = Exchange rate effects on exports = Mainly in export-oriented economies, the effects of monetary policy transmission operating through exchange rate effects has been a major concern of their central banks. Expansionary monetary policy will cause the interest rate in a country to fall and deposits that are denominated in that domestic currency become less attractive than their foreign equivalents. As a result, the value of domestic deposits will fall compared to foreign deposits, which leads to a depreciation of the domestic currency. Since the value of the domestic currency is falling compared to foreign currencies, it now takes more of the domestic currency to buy a same amount in the foreign currency, and thus a depreciation of a currency is denoted be ‚Üëe. As a result of this depreciation (domestic products become cheaper), net exports will rise and consequently so will aggregate spending. ‚Üë M ‚Üí ‚Üë e ‚Üí ‚Üë NX ‚Üí ‚Üë Y. = Exchange rate effects on balance sheets = When countries have debt denominated in foreign currencies, the burden of their financial debt will rise when an expansionary monetary policy is implemented. The same reason in as in the previous section applies. The domestic currency will depreciate against the foreign currency and this will increase the amount of foreign currency needed to pay the debt and the debt burden increases. However, assets that are debt- financed are generally denoted in the domestic currency, and thus their value does nog increase with expansionary policy, but rather decreases the net worth (compared to foreign currency). This again increases the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection and therefore will drive the amount of funds available through lending down. As a results, investment spending and accordingly aggregate spending will decrease. ‚Üë M ‚Üí ‚Üë e ‚Üí ‚Üì NW ‚Üí ‚Üì I ‚Üí ‚Üì Y Note that both effects of the exchange rate are opposite.  Real estate price channel  Another important asset besides stocks that should therefore also be considered as an important transmission channel is real estate. Real estate prices can affect the output of an economy via three different routes: 1) effects on housing expenditures, 2) household's wealth and 3) bank balance sheets. = Direct effects on housing expenditure = A monetary expansion policy that goes with a decrease of the interest rate, lowers the costs of financing houses (debt financing becomes cheaper). With equal house prices, houses become relatively more expensive and the construction of new houses (H) becomes more attractive. As a result, housing expenditures (such as the construction of new houses) will increase and so aggregate demand will rise. ‚Üë M ‚Üí ‚Üë Phouses ‚Üí ‚Üë H ‚Üí ‚Üë Y. = Household wealth effects = As we saw in Modigliani's lifecycle consumption theory before, houses are also a very important component of a households‚Äô financial wealth. The amount of financial wealth of a household directly affects the amount of spending. Therefore, an expansionary monetary policy that increases the housing prices also increases a household's financial wealth. This will have a positive effects on consumption and spending behavior. Therefore: ‚Üë M ‚Üí ‚Üë Phouses ‚Üí ‚Üë W ‚Üí ‚Üë C ‚Üí ‚Üë Y.  The role of asset prices in monetary policy  = Developed countries = Developed countries experience an increasing level of market integration and therefore the asset price channel becomes increasingly important in the transmission of monetary policy into the economy. The effects of monetary policies depend on other countries, and we have seen that a mechanism such as the exchange rate also depends on other assets. However, despite the significance of asset prices in the conduct of monetary policy, economic outcomes might be worse when central banks try to target asset prices because this erodes the support for their independence.ECB (2010) Monetary Policy transmission in the Euro area, a decade after the introduction of the Euro = Emerging countries = Emerging countries and developing countries often have a larger part of their debt in foreign currencies and in that case expansionary monetary policy can actually have contractionary effects because the net worth of banks may fall. As a result, less funds will be available and investment will fall, and so will aggregate expenditure. Depreciation in emerging markets, when acting contractionary, are dangerous because they can trigger a financial crisis.Mihaljek, D., & Klau, M. (2008).

It is located approximately northeast of Winlock. It came about as German and Swiss immigrants settled here in the late 1800s. At the height of its prosperity the hub of this community, located at the intersection of Military Road and the Sargent Road, consisted of a small store, the Catholic church, a school and a Grange hall. Today only the Grange hall and church remain. The church has been decommissioned but a cemetery is still maintained. The church, originally called the Assumption Catholic Church (later called St. Urban) was dedicated on August 15, 1891. That day is the Feast of the Assumption. By the early 2000s the church building had become dilapidated and was in need of repair. The Archdiocese of Seattle was contemplating destroying the building. A group of former residents and their descendants, concerned about the loss of a historic landmark, formed the St. Urban Settlement Foundation in an effort to save the church. Volunteers worked towards the restoration effort that culminated in the reopening of the building with a ceremony on August 15, 2010.

In 2001, newly enacted term-limit regulations forced Harrison to relinquish her seat. Previously, she represented the 26th district in the New York State Assembly from 1984-85 after working for many years as a community and political activist. After leaving the council, she continued to be politically active, winning the post of Democratic female district leader from Assembly District 22 Part B in 2010.Creator's Sketch, Councilwoman Julia Harrison Records, 1942-1943, 1948, 1956-2001 (Bulk 1968-2001), Archives at Queens Library Early life and education She was born Julia Hirsch on June 10, 1920 in Rochester, New York, the daughter of Henry and Magdalena Hirsch. Henry, a laborer and factory worker, and Magdalena, a house cleaner and factory worker, both emigrated from Hungary as children, and married in 1919. The family later moved to Manhattan where Harrison attended Public School #9 and New York Evening High School. In 1952, Julia Hirsch married Joseph Harrison and moved to Flushing, Queens. While living in Flushing, Harrison became a civic activist, involving herself in the union movement, parent-teacher associations, housing co-ops and more. She did not become politically active until 1968, when she participated in Eugene McCarthy's presidential campaign. In 1972, she earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science from Queens College. New York Assembly Harrison joined the Democratic Club of Flushing, Whitestone, College Point and in 1972, was elected District Leader for the New York State 26th Assembly District, Part A. Throughout the 1970s she continued to be re-elected to that position and unsuccessfully ran for New York State Senate in 1978.

In November 1984, she was re-elected to the 186th New York State Legislature. In November 1985, she was elected to the New York City Council. New York City Council In 1985, Harrison was elected to represent the 19th district on the New York City Council, becoming the first woman on the Council from the borough of Queens. At the time, the 19th district covered a large portion of northern Queens including Flushing, Whitestone, Beechhurst, Corona, Bayside and Douglaston. However, the city's districts were soon changed and Harrison's became the 20th, covering Flushing and a small part of Whitestone. =Committee assignments= During her Council tenure, Harrison served on the Committees for Aging, Education, Government Operations, Health, and Standards and Ethics. She chaired the Standards and Ethics Committee in 1991, and led the Committee on Aging for a number of years. As chair of the Aging Committee, she successfully led a campaign to assist senior citizens with the Senior Citizens Homeowners Exemption (SCHE) and Senior Citizens Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) programs. Her committee was also active in other areas, including the investigation of elder abuse; elderly drug abuse; and the state's Expanded In-Home Services for the Elderly Program. Harrison was also the chairperson of the Legislative Panel on Medical Technology. This panel investigated the use of acupuncture to treat health- threatening issues such as crack addiction, HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. The panel's advocacy was instrumental in opening the first acupuncture drug detoxification clinic in Queens at Queens General Hospital. In cooperation with the first Drug Court in New York, this clinic became an alternative to incarceration. The panel also created legislation to install condom machines in public sleeping facilities and to license prostitutes to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. =Flushing-focused efforts= Harrison and other community activists created the Coalition for a Planned Flushing in 1989, beginning a decade-long attempt to implement a controlled plan for the downtown area. She used her councilwoman's land-use powers to plan certain areas of her district and acquired city council funds to hire an architect to create a plan for Flushing. Harrison also addressed constituent issues such as airplane safety, prostitution, the MTA's renovation of the Flushing‚ÄìMain Street subway station, the disrepair of Flushing's Municipal Parking Garage, the erection of a Korean War Veterans monument, various construction issues, and more. In 1996, she generated unfavorable publicity when a New York Times article quoted her as saying Asian immigrants were \\"invaders\\" and \\"criminals.\\" She apologized for the remarks and stated they were taken out of context. Despite the incident, she was re-elected that fall for her final term in office. As was the case with many of her City Council colleagues, Harrison's Council career ended on December 31, 2001, when for the first time New York City politicians could not run for the same office they previously held.

He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1655, was called to the Bar in 1660, and entered the King's Inn in 1661. His choice of the law as a profession may have been influenced by the fact that James Barry, 1st Baron Barry of Santry, a leading barrister who became Lord Chief Justice of Ireland in 1660, was his cousin, his mother being Adam's paternal aunt Anne Cusacke.

He had also the advantage of having married Catherine Keating, sister of John Keating, later to be Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas and niece of Maurice Eustace, Lord Chancellor of Ireland.Ball p.287 The only serious objection to his appointment to the High Court Bench was his health: from early middle age onwards he suffered badly from gout, which became so severe that he was unable to perform his judicial duties for at least two years.Ball, F.

It was dedicated in 1279 to St. Nicholas of Myra, the patron saint of sailors. Since 1524 it is an Evangelical Lutheran church.  History  The construction of St. Nicholas Church began as a hall church with a tower in 1234, after Stralsund acquired city rights. The planning and building in the oldest part of Stralsund continued alongside the planning of the Town Hall in the Old Market. This suggests that Nicholas Church was from the beginning intended to be the council church of the city. A council church was not just a place of worship, but was also the location for holding board meetings, receiving ambassadors, announcing laws and regulations, handling legal cases, and preserving city archives. After 1270, the unfinished St. Nicholas Church was rebuilt as a basilica, following the design of St. Mary's Church in L√ºbeck. The just-completed choir of the church hall had to be demolished to make way for the choir of the new basilica, which consisted of an inner choir and an ambulatory. Around the chancel, which consisted of five sides of an imaginary octagon, five chapels were created. Parts of the walls of the side aisles served as an abutment from then on. In the beginning, the building material of the church building was brick. Over the course of time, at least 65 different types of stone were used. The construction of the western tower began in 1300. By 1314, the tower had reached a height of 13 meters. At that time, the council decided to build two towers. Around 1350, the construction of the nave between the two towers was completed. The buttresses of the aisles were connected externally to create space in the interior. The buttresses were thus drawn inward and vaulted chapels were built in the space freed up between the towers. Of the two towers, the south tower was first completed, probably in the early 15th century. This was followed by the completion of construction of the north tower. The two Gothic towers were equally high. The wealth of the city of Stralsund was reflected in the very large number of altars in the church. There were no less than 56 altars in the chancel, nave, and between the buttresses of the aisles. The bulk of the altars were removed from the church after the Bildersturm of 1525. Since the introduction of Reformation, the chapels were mainly used as spaces for burying distinguished citizens. A fire in 1662 destroyed the wooden spires of the towers. In 1667, the southern tower was provided with a Baroque dome, while the northern tower was closed with a temporary roof. During the American bombing of Stralsund on October 6, 1944, the roof and windows of St. Nicholas Church were damaged. Repairs started in 1947.  Reformation  On June 1, 1523, the Protestant reformer Christian Ketelhot preached for the first time in St. Nicholas Church. The city council turned a blind eye to this, especially because some councillors and the mayor himself had converted to Protestantism. The new doctrine allowed both Catholics and Protestants to worship in the same church, but Catholic priests and monks were increasingly mocked on the streets and Catholic priests were often openly ridiculed or belittled during sermons. The conflict escalated during the autumn of 1524, when the Dominican lector Wilhelm Lowe was dragged from the pulpit and abused. In 1525, the Bildersturm broke out in the church, which then spread to other churches in Stralsund. Altars and shrines were destroyed or stolen. A majority of the population and members of the city council then converted to Protestantism. Together with the reformer Johann Kureke, Ketelhot was one of the first Protestant ministers of St. Nicholas Church.  Equipment  = High altar = The high altar was made by a Stralsund sculptor around 1480. During World War II the altar was removed from the church and stowed in a safe place, but it was nevertheless partially destroyed. In 1948 the damaged altar returned to the church. In 1997, a new crucifix built by Halberstadt artist Johann-Peter Hinz was installed. The central part of the 6.70 wide by 4.20 meters high altar shows the crucifixion of Christ. The wings and the central part feature numerous carved figures, all depicting the story of the Passion. The predella is dedicated to Christ's birth. In 1992, the painted wings were taken from the altar and now protrude from the two pillars on the left and right of the altar. These depict scenes from the life of Saint Anne and Mary, mother of Jesus. = Other altars and pews = The church once housed 56 altars. Most of the altars were owned by guilds, though some were owned individual families. They were scattered throughout the church, often attached to the pillars. During the Bildersturm of 1525, many altars were lost. The altar of the tailors' guild, built at the end of the 15th century and placed in a privileged position near the high altar, was preserved. The mayor's altar (1510), the altar of the Junge family (1430), the so-called \\"altar of the Bergen merchants\\", the altars of the basketmakers and saddlemakers, and the Olav altar were also preserved. = Schl√ºter altar (main altar) = The Schl√ºter altar was designed by the Prussian court architect Andreas Schl√ºter, best known for designing the Amber Room. The main altar between the nave and chancel was installed in place of the former rood loft. The construction work was done by the Stralsund sculptor Thomas Phalert, a student of Schl√ºter. In 1708 the work was finished, but it took until 1733 for the painting to be finished, and the gilding was introduced only in 1735. In the center the altar, which has been decorated on both sides, is a carved relief of the Eye of Providence surrounded by a cloud wreath with angels praising it and playing musical instruments, and flanked by column pillars with standing angels in front of them. Above it is a representation of the Last Supper. The grand altar is crowned with a crucifix and statues that represent hope and faith. The fences with putti and garlands on either side of the altar are from 1707-1708. = Statue of Virgin and Child with Saint Anne = In the north ambulatory, there is a statue of Anna Selbdritt (Virgin and Child with Saint Anne) dating back to the late 13th century. The statue shows the remnants of the original paint and is one of the earliest statues of Anna Selbdritt in the Baltic region. = Astronomical clock = Behind the high altar is the astronomical clock, which was built in 1394 by Nikolaus Lilienfeld. The clock is part of a whole series of monumental clocks, which were installed since the 14th century in churches in different cities of the Hanseatic League. It has a wheel train with a mechanical escapement. In addition to day and night times, the positions of the sun, moon, and fixed stars can also be read off the clock. It is the oldest almost completely preserved astronomical clock in the Baltic region and also the oldest mechanical clock in the world that still contains its original wheels. = Pewage of Riga merchants = Four oak reliefs from the altar of the Stralsund merchants who travelled to Riga for conducting trade still remain. The tables were created in 1420. After the demolition of the altar, the reliefs got put into the church benches, until they were rediscovered in 1840. Usually such reliefs contain religious imagery, but the remaining remnants of the pew of the Riga merchants' guild are on purely secular themes. Three of the four reliefs show Russians, with their characteristic long beards and wearing fur, hunting and harvesting honey and resin (products which were shipped from Riga to Stralsund). The fourth table shows the marketing of these products by Russians to Stralsund merchants.  Organs  St. Nicholas Church has two large and two small organs: * The large organ was built by Carl August Buchholz in 1841 and has 56 stops, three manuals, and a pedal. It is the largest organ built in Germany in the period 1800-1850 which is still functional today. During 2003-2006 the organ was restored by the organ makers Wegscheider of Dresden and Klais of Bonn, and restored to its original condition. * The choir organ of the church, located between the southern side of the church and the choir, was built by the organ maker Alexander Schuke from Potsdam in 1986. The drag loading tool with mechanical action holds 22 records distributed over two manuals and a pedal. * In addition to the two larger organs, since 2012 there is a smaller organ in the children's church. It is a positive from 1965 built by the company Reinhard Schmei√üer from Rochlitz.  Painting  The first attempts to renew the church's medieval colour scheme were made in 1891. Remains found near the organ were used as an example. The Berlin painter August Grimmer painted the leaf decorations in the arcades of the choir. The nave, the aisles, and tower chapels were painted by the Linnemann brothers from Frankfurt. From 1980, after thorough research, the restoration of the medieval color patterns was performed.

Fossils of petalocrinoids have been found in China, Europe and the United States. All petalocrinoids have five, flattened arms formed through the fusion of the branches of the ancestral crinoid arm, an Ordovician crinoid possibly similar to the Silurian Gissocrinus or Arachnocrinus. The shape of these fused arms varies from genus to genus, and from species to species. The upper surface of the arms had distinctive patterns of grooves which are thought to have born captured food particles towards the mouth. The purpose of the arms, themselves, remain unknown, though, some researchers suspect that they may deterred predators by presenting a would-be attacker with a largely inedible chunk of calcite. Genera =Eopetalocrinus= Eopetalocrinus is the earliest known petalocrinoid, known from a single set of five arms from Arenig-aged strata of Southern China. =Petalocrinus= Petalocrinus is the most successful genus in the family, with numerous species found in Lower Silurian strata in the United States, England, Gotland, and China. The arms of Petalocrinus are usually wedge-shaped, akin to a guitar pick, though, some species, like the English P. bifurcatus, have their own distinct shapes (in the case of P. bifurcatus, each arm is bifurcated into the shape of a \\"V\\"). =Sinopetalocrinus= Sinopetalocrinus is one of three petalocrinoid genera endemic to Chinese strata, and is thought to be the daughter genus of Petalocrinus, the result of a diversification event in the early Silurian that produced it, and Spirocrinus. Sinopetalocrinus is very similar in anatomy to Petalocrinus. =Spirocrinus= Spirocrinus is one of three petalocrinoid genera endemic to Chinese strata. It is found in Lower Silurian strata together with species of its sister genus Sinopetalocrinus, and parent genus Petalocrinus. Spirocrinus is unmistakably distinct, as its arms are modified into cigar-shapes, covered in feeding grooves. =Vadarocrinus= Vadarocrinus is the only petalocrinoid genus known from the Devonian, being found in lower Devonian strata of the Konƒõprusy Limestone, Bohemia. The arms are curved downward. Because the paleoenvironment is thought to have been filled with turbulent water currents, and that a recently found stem ossicle suggests a thick stem, Vadarocrinus is thought to have had a very short stem, compared to other petalocrinoids.Prokop, Rudolf J., and V√°clav Petr. \\"New finds of Vadarocrinus vassa Prokop, 1984 (Crinoidea, Petalocrinidae) in the Konƒïprusy and Lodƒïnice Limestones (Lower Devonian, Pragian) of the Barrandian area, Czech Republic.\\" Journal of the National Museum (Prague) National History Series 179 (2010).

Later he joined the Military Music Department of the Cypriot National Guard (SMEF). After his mandatory military service, Roussos left Cyprus for the United States to pursue his education. Education Roussos graduated Harvard Business School, the University of Southern California, Musicians Institute and Pepperdine University. Career After 2003, Roussos became an investor in new domain names, which he described as virtual real estate. In 2005 he started a global outreach initiative to launch a new top-level domain for the music industry under the brand .MUSIC. On 15 February 2011, Roussos authored an article for the music trade magazine Billboard called \\"How .music Will Save the Industry.\\" Roussos said that \\"by incorporating efficient registration policy-making and domain name authentication, monies will flow directly into the pockets of artists and the music community, not to pirates or unlicensed illegitimate websites.\\" Roussos also said that the .music he proposes will benefit the music industry because the \\".music domain will serve as a badge of trust, safety and credibility to the music consumer. By allowing only verified music community members to register their domain, .music will ensure it will be used in a safe and responsible manner. Confidential consumer data, security and stability are a priority. Stricter guidelines for registration will also help protect Internet users from malware, phishing or any other malicious behavior that can arise as well as increase trust.\\" According to the Washington Post, \\"Roussos believes the .music domain will help Internet users easily connect to their favorite band's real Web site by typing the name of the band followed by .music on their Web browser; and will help musicians sell their music directly to consumers. Many famous bands ‚Äì Queen, Kiss, the Eagles ‚Äì don't own their own .com Web sites because their names use common words.\\" According to the Los Angeles Times, \\"under his plan, only legitimate, professional artists could be approved for a .music suffix. If fans typed in ladygaga.music or queen.music, he says, they would know they were getting authentic sites rather than pirates or imitators that are frequently found in .com and .net domains.\\" In 2012, the ICANN new generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD) Program launched and .MUSIC applied for the .music gTLD under the company name DotMusic Limited as a community- based Applicant with support from established institutions associated with the music industry. According to the New York Times, .MUSIC was \\"supported by government bodies across the world and by several central companies that deal with unsigned acts, like the digital distributor TuneCore and the Web service ReverbNation\\" and that .MUSIC‚Äôs priority is to make the .music domain widely available to the global music community while balancing the needs for inclusiveness and security.\\" Roussos also partnered with Tina Dam to form another TLD-related business with clients such as William Morris Endeavor and News Corp. According to Hollywood Reporter, Roussos is the \\"co-founder of domain management firm MyTLD.com, who has lobbied for industry support with assurances he'll use gTLDs as safe havens for entertainment consumption.\\" Roussos also represented the independent music sector and other associated clearly delineated communities in Community Objections filed with the International Chamber of Commerce against new gTLD applicants (including Google and Amazon) to increase competition, prevent anti-competitive behaviour and ensure appropriate enhanced safeguards are implemented to protect intellectual property owners from cybersquatting, malicious abuse, copyright infringement and piracy. Roussos also represented .MUSIC in Legal Rights Objections filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization against music-themed gTLD Applicants. .MUSIC held registered trademarks in nearly 30 countries for the \\".music\\" and \\"dotmusic marks\\" under classification for domain registration and domain name registry services, and management of databases for domain names. According to the New York Post, Roussos claimed that \\"it is clear that if ICANN grants the applied-for .music gTLD to any of these applicants, it will create intended material harm to us [and] take unfair advantage of and unjustifiably impair the distinctive character and goodwill reputation of our .music-related trademarks.\\" Panels and awards Roussos has participated in panels at ICANN public meetings, Harvard Business School, the University of Southern California, the University of California Los Angeles, New York University, Georgetown University, Pepperdine University, CMJ, the Future of Music Coalition, Popkomm, SoundCTRL and San Francisco Music Tech.

The droop flap is similar to the leading-edge slat and the Krueger flap, but with the difference that the entire leading edge section rotates downwards, whereas the slat and Krueger flap are panels which move away from the wing leading edge when it is deployed.Norris & Wagner (2005), pp.67-68 Location A leading-edge droop flap comprises the rounded front part of a wing, in movable form. The Airbus A380 has droop flaps between the fuselage and each inboard engine, at the leading edge of the thickest part of each wing.

The A380's designers found that the airflow between the engines was separating from the wing surface prior to the airflow between the engine and the fuselage, an undesirable characteristic. Adding droop between the engine and the fuselage fixed the problem; whereas using a leading-edge slat would not have done so because of the gap (or slot) created between a slat and the wing when a slat is deployed.Norris & Wagner (2005), p.67 Aircraft with droop flaps * Airbus A380 * Airbus A350 * Dassault Falcon 20 * Hawker Siddeley Trident * Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 * Northrop F-5 See also * British European Airways Flight 548 - a Hawker Siddeley Trident crash in which premature retraction of the droop flaps was a factor * Variable camber wing References = Notes = = Bibliography = * * Category:Aircraft controls Category:Aircraft wing components ","title":"Leading-edge droop flap"},{"id":"42132899","text":"Simen Johan (born 1973) is a Norwegian-Swedish contemporary artist, photographer and sculptor living in New York City. Early life and education Simen Johan was born in Kirkenes, in the extreme north of Norway. S√°mi Heritage. He moved to H√∂llviken, Sweden in 1979. After attending film school at Lugnetskolan in Falun, Sweden, Johan moved to New York City in 1992 to continue his studies at School of Visual Arts, where he studied under Duane Michals, James Casebere, and Gregory Crewdson. Early work In 1993, Johan drew attention for his pioneering work merging digital manipulation with traditional darkroom techniques. At a time when digital photo processing was in its infancy, Johan found ways to exploit the medium beyond the boundaries of what was then considered possible. His images recombined fragments of faces and bodies (including his own) into new characters, which he then situated into similarly fabricated scenes. By inverting his files and then printing them onto transparent film, Johan was able to produce \\"negatives,\\" allowing him to use traditional darkroom processes to create sepia toned silver gelatin prints. By the mid-90s, his work was frequently featured in exhibitions spearheading digital art, including Bit by Bit: Postphotographic Imaging, at Hunter College, New York, and (R)evolution, at Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia \\"Leonardo da Vinci\\" in Milan, Italy. Later work and career Until the Kingdom Comes, 2011 With his series Evidence of Things Unseen (2000-2004), Johan began creating large format color prints. In a review for The Village Voice, Vince Aletti wrote: \\"Johan's...new pictures continue to plumb a troubled dream world where fantasy and ritual meet. In virtually all of these images, solitary, self-possessed youngsters appear to be engaged in bizarre masquerades... There's an edge of horror and derangement in these photos that's all the more disturbing because it seems as much a projection of the child's imagination as the photographer's.\\" A traveling museum exhibition of this series was organized by Kunstnernes Hus in Oslo, Norway, and the National Art Museum of Lithuania. A. D. Coleman wrote the catalogue essay. In 2005, Johan shifted his focus towards the natural world, at the same time also beginning to create sculptural works. The images in his series Until the Kingdom Comes incorporate elements photographed in a wide variety of locations around the world, including both wild and captive animals. According to the New Yorker, \\"At nearly six feet by eight feet, the largest of these pictures rival natural-history dioramas, but very little is natural about this menagerie. A deer in a snowy forest is uncannily white; malevolent snakes curl around sticks and one another in a sunny ravine, like fugitives from Dante's Inferno. Johan undermines even his most convincing fictions, and the nagging sense that something is wrong here keeps viewers just where he wants us: on edge.\\" The sculptures, as featured in the New York Times \\"incorporate taxidermy, insects and foliage into parasitical eco-systems resonant with the vitality of ritualistic headdresses,\\" while others, shaped like meteorites, were constructed from barnacles, cement and fiber optics. Solo exhibitions of Until the Kingdom Comes were presented at Brown University, Providence, RI; the Frist Center for the Visual Arts, Nashville and at the Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX. A limited edition book was published in 2014. Johan received the New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in 2002, the Pollock- Krasner Foundation Grant in 2009 and the George A. and Eliza Gardner Howard Foundation Grant for Photography in 2012. His work has appeared on the covers of Aperture (magazine) and Art+Auction, and he was interviewed on WNYC's Leonard Lopate radio show. In 2010, Comme des Gar√ßons used Johan's sculpture of a long haired wolf for their fall advertising campaign. Louis Vuitton incorporated his work into their spring 2017 ad campaign. His image of a buffalo reclining in littered dirt was featured in Oliver Stone's film Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Johan has been represented by the Yossi Milo Gallery since 2000.

Mayas inhabited several parts of Mexico and Central America, including Chiapas, the northern lowlands of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, the southern lowlands and highlands of Guatemala, Belize, and parts of western El Salvador and Honduras. Genetic studies of the Maya people are reported to show higher levels of variation when compared to other groups. Maya intra-population variation has been examined by means of the following tests: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms, polymorphic Alu insertions, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and Y chromosome data. The results indicate that ancestors of the Mayas made a finite number of entries into the Americas over the Bering land bridge. Human leukocyte antigen polymorphisms In a study conducted by Michael H. Crawford, human leukocyte antigen loci were found to encode for major histocompatibility complexes. Allele frequencies were plotted for similarities using principal component analysis (PCA) for the HLA-A locus exhibited by the Mayan population. Results plot close similarities with the Inupiat people of Native Alaskan heritage, the Waiapi of central Brazil and the Tohono O'odham of northern Mexico. The HLA-B locus was examined in a PCA plot and indicates a proximity to the Zuni of southwest North America and the Aymara of southern South America. Transferrins, immunoglobulins and globulin allotypes In a study conducted by Crawford, the transferrin, TF*B, allele was found to occur among the Lacandon Maya at a frequency of .019, among a group of mestizos (admixture of indigenous and Spanish people) of Tlaxcala (0.23), the Pima of the southwestern U.S. (0.32), the Chinantecos (0.28), and the Cora (0.05). Crawford states ‚ÄúThe chance occurrence of the same mutation was acted upon by either the founder effect or selection‚Äù. The GM immunoglobulin allotype is inherited from both parents in units called haplotypes and carried amongst populations. The GM system diagnosis reveals population similarities and levels of admixture. Among the Maya population, the haplotypes present are: GM*A G (64.9), GM*X G (12.3) and GM*A T (4.4). GM frequencies of distinct Siberian groups has been documented. The Samoyeds and the Na-Dene express high frequencies of GM*X G and GM*A T. The Eskimo and Chukchi people display high frequencies of GM*A G and intermediate frequencies of GM*A T. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) =mtDNA frequency distributions throughout the Americas= A study by Herrera et al. detailed genetic affinities between four groups of Maya: Mayas of Buctzotz and Yucat√°n, Kaqchikel people, Mayas of Campeche, and the K'iche' people. \\"Intra-population diversity was presented as four (APO, COL3A1, NBC4 and TCR) of the ten loci displayed allelic frequencies at fixation for the insertion or lack of insertion state\\". Three (APO, NBC4 and PV92) represent fixation of the insertion allele, while it was absent in non- native groups . Heterozygosity averages among the ten loci from the K'iche' at 0.133, the Buctzotz group at 0.249 and the Kaqchikel 0.171. Inter-population diversity was reported in reference to differences in allelic frequencies between the Mayans and other Native Americans, Europeans, Africans and Asians as (P<0.001). =mtDNA frequency distributions among Mayas= Inter-population variation within the Mayan group was identified in 18% of the total population. They were found to exhibit higher intra-population variation, except for loci D1, NBC4 and PV92, than comparable Native American populations. Comparing the phylogenetic relationships among the four Mayan subgroups Cakchique, Quiche, Campeche and Buctzotz; the Cakchiquel and Quiche cluster together. The Yucat√°n, Campeche and Buctzotz cluster within the same clade but different somewhat from the Guatemalan Mayans. The Alaskan Eskimos were intermediate between the Yucat√°ns and the Guatemalans. In the study by Herrera, cluster analysis was employed to ascertain relative gene flow and/or differences in effective population size among the four groups of Maya. The Buctzotz and the Campeche reported a higher than average gene flow and/or effective population size. The Cakchiquel and the Quiche indicated by Herrera et al. display a lower than average gene flow and/or effective population size. The Buctzotz and Quiche were listed as being outliers. An AMOVA (Analysis of Molecular Variance) relates a ‚Äúcorrelation or parallelism between genetic differentiation on one hand and geographical categories or linguistic types on the other.‚Äù The AMOVA compared inter-population and intra-population affinities. The only significant differences among the populations were in linguistics and genetics. \\"The high allelic frequency levels at or near fixation is the result of genetic drift, bottle neck events and/or the founder effect.‚Äù The founder effect was defined for the low heterozygosity amongst the Quiche and Cakchiquel. The Yucat√°n Mayans exhibited greater heterozygosity. This effect ‚Äúwas due to the extensive commerce and interaction with technologically advanced neighbors and compared with their southern counterparts was the accessibility to travel.‚Äù Both instances of variability among the Mayan groups suggest their genetic diversity and uniqueness. All pair-wise combinations display proportionate genetic differences. ‚ÄúThe data may be indicative of the lack of genetic homogeneity among the four Mayan groups, especially when comparing the Guatemalan to the Yucatecan.‚Äù In her 2011 doctoral dissertation, Anne Justice compared mtDNA data from literature and sampled two populations from Guatemala, the Chorti‚Äô and Poqomchi‚Äô. Results found four mtDNA haplogroups A, B, C, and D.. Haplogroup A, (np) 16111 mutation of C to T and a Hae III Restriction enzyme site at np 633. mtDNA HincII morph-6 (site loss at np 13 259) and an AluI site gain at 13 262. Lineage A displays to be predominant in the north and nearly nonexistent in the south. Haplogroup B is signified by a 9-bp Region V deletion. An HaeIII site at np 663 indicates polymorphism (haplotype AM6)[3]. The 9-bp deletion sets the parameters for lineage B, dominant in the south. Haplogroup B displays a 9-bp deletion with populations grouped from South America, Central America, North America, and across the Bering Strait into Siberia. There is a cline in frequency toward the north. Higher frequencies were reported in the south and were almost absent in the north. It has been suggested that the 9-bp deletion may have developed independently but it ‚Äúappears to be on the same genetic background throughout the New World, Asia, and the Pacific, indicating a common origin.‚Äù The Mayas of Cop√°n and Yucatec display an absence for the 9-bp deletion. It is proposed that the two groups have separate linguistics, and within the group there is a level of variation. Haplogroup C has a signature loss of Hinc II restriction site at np 13259 and an Alu I restriction site added at np 13262. Haplogroup D has a loss of Alu I restriction site at np 5176. Lineages C and D were reported to have variable frequencies. Haplogroup X is defined by an addition of Accl np 14465 and a mutation of T to C at np 16189, C to T at np 16278. The contemporary Mexican Maya displayed lineages A and B predominately while the Cop√°n Maya were lineages C and D. Identical mitochondrial DNA haplotypes S26 (AM43) and S13 (AM88) are expressed within both Siberian and Amerindian groups. \\"The S and AM designations represent the same haplotypes defined by the presence or absence of the specific restriction sites\\". A path of separation would have lasted over a period of 15,000 to 40,000 years. Y chromosome =Y-chromosome frequencies throughout the Americas= ‚ÄúThe high resolution data on population history‚Äù that the Y chromosome exhibits make it a practical marker in the study of genetics. The Y chromosome is inherited from a father and is passed to his son, the sex chromosomes of males being XY and of females XX. The Y chromosome is 95% incapable of recombination. The tails of either end of the Y chromosome are pseudoautosomal, which pairs with the homologous portions of the X chromosome The chromosome itself hold 500 STRs, or repetitive sequences of copies of the genome that happen at a specific marker/place containing 3-8-bp repeats. Two haplogroups are presented: Q-M242 and C-M130. Haplogroup Q-M242, containing subgroups, is found in each tested population within the Americas. Haplogroup C-M130 is almost absent in Central and South America. \\"Haplogroup C-M130 is dated to have expanded ~30,000 to 25,000 BP and haplogroup Q-M242 ~18,000 to 15,000 BP\\".

By the start of the eighteenth century, a political union between Scotland and England became politically and economically attractive, promising to open up the much larger markets of England, as well as those of the growing British Empire, resulting in the Treaty of Union of 1707. There was a conscious attempt among the gentry and nobility to improve agriculture in Scotland. New crops were introduced and enclosures began to displace the run rig system and free pasture. The economic benefits of union were very slow to appear, some progress was visible, such as the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow after 1740. Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glass-works, breweries, and soap-works, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial center after 1815. The linen industry was Scotland's premier industry in the eighteenth century and formed the basis for the later cotton, jute, and woolen industries. Encouraged and subsidized by the Board of Trustees so it could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market. Historians often emphasize that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the nineteenth century. At first the leading industry, based in the west, was the spinning and weaving of cotton. After the cutting off of supplies of raw cotton from 1861 as a result of the American Civil War Scottish entrepreneurs and engineers, and its large stock of easily mined coal, the country diversified into engineering, shipbuilding, and locomotive construction, with steel replacing iron after 1870. As a result, Scotland became a center for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives. Scotland was already one of the most urbanized societies in Europe by 1800. Glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world, and known as \\"the Second City of the Empire\\" after London. Dundee upgraded its harbor and established itself as an industrial and trading center. The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis. Owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class. Even with the growth of industry there were insufficient good jobs, as a result, during the period 1841‚Äì1931, about two million Scots emigrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England. By the twenty-first century, there were about as many people who were Scottish Canadians and Scottish Americans as the five million remaining in Scotland. Background Adam Smith. the \\"father of modern economics\\" By the start of the eighteenth century, a political union between Scotland and England became politically and economically attractive, promising to open up the much larger markets of England, as well as those of the growing British Empire. The Scottish parliament voted on 6 January 1707, by 110 to 69 to adopt the Treaty of Union. It was a full economic union. Most of its 25 articles dealt with economic arrangements for the new state known as \\"Great Britain\\". It added 45 Scots to the 513 members of the House of Commons of Great Britain and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the House of Lords, and ended the Scottish parliament. It also replaced the Scottish systems of currency, taxation and laws regulating trade with laws made in London. England had about five times the population of Scotland at the time, and about 36 times as much wealth.T. C. Smout, \\"The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707. I: The Economic Background\\", Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 16, No. 3, pp. 455‚Äì67 in JSTOR Major factors that facilitated industrialisation in Scotland included cheap and abundant labour; natural resources that included coal, blackband ironstone and potential water power; the development of new technologies, among them the steam engine and markets that would buy Scottish products. Other factors that also contributed to the process included the improvement of transport links, which helped facilitated the movement of goods, an extensive banking system, and the widespread adoption of ideas about economic development with their origins in the Scottish Enlightenment.R. Finley, \\"4. Economy: 1770‚Äì1850 age of industrialization\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 198‚Äì9. =Enlightenment= In the eighteenth century, the Scottish Enlightenment brought the country to the front of intellectual achievement in Europe.A. Herman, How the Scots Invented the Modern World (London: Crown Publishing Group, 2001), . The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific. Adam Smith developed and published The Wealth of Nations, the first work of modern economics. It had an immediate impact on British economic policy and still frames discussions on globalisation and tariffs.M.

Key scientific work included the discoveries of William Cullen, physician and chemist; James Anderson, an agronomist; Joseph Black, physicist and chemist; and James Hutton, the first modern geologist.J. Repcheck, The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of the Earth's Antiquity (Cambridge, MA: Basic Books, 2003), , pp. 117‚Äì43. While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the eighteenth century,. disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as James Hutton, James Watt, William Murdoch, James Clerk Maxwell and Lord Kelvin.E. Wills, Scottish Firsts: a Celebration of Innovation and Achievement (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 2002), . =Agricultural revolution= An 1851 illustration showing the reaping machine developed by Patrick Bell After the union with England in 1707, there was a conscious attempt among the gentry and nobility to improve agriculture in Scotland. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 288‚Äì91. In the first half of the century these changes were limited to tenanted farms in East Lothian and the estates of a few enthusiasts, such as John Cockburn and Archibald Grant. Not all were successful, with Cockburn driving himself into bankruptcy, but the ethos of improvement spread among the landed classes.I. D. Whyte, \\"Economy: primary sector: 1 Agriculture to 1770s\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 206‚Äì7. Haymaking was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. There was increasing specialisation, with the Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the borders of sheep. Although some estate holders improved the quality of life of their displaced workers, the Agricultural Revolution led directly to what is increasingly known as the Lowland Clearances,Robert Allan Houston and Ian D. Whyte, Scottish Society, 1500‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , pp. 148‚Äì151. when hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years. Improvement continued in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working reaping machine, developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production and the result was the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.G. Sprot, \\"Agriculture, 1770s onwards\\", in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 321‚Äì3. The development of Scottish agriculture meant that Scotland could support its increased population with food and it released labour that would take part in industrial production. =Banking= The former headquarters of the British Linen Bank in St Andrews Square, Edinburgh The first banks formed in Scotland were the Bank of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1695) and the Royal Bank of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1727).R. Saville, Bank of Scotland: a History, 1695‚Äì1995 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press 1996), . Glasgow would soon follow with branches of its own (notably, the first was to be Dunlop, Houston & Co. in 1749, known as \\"the Ship Bank\\" for the image of a ship printed on all their bills)Michael Meighan, Glasgow: A History (Amberley Publishing, 2013), p. 22. and Scotland had a flourishing financial system by the end of the century. There were over 400 branches, amounting to one office per 7,000 people, double the level in England. The banks were more lightly regulated than those in England. Historians often emphasise that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the nineteenth century.M. J. Daunton, Progress and Poverty: An Economic and Social History of Britain 1700‚Äì1850 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), , p. 344.T. Cowen and R. Kroszner, \\"Scottish Banking before 1845: A Model for Laissez-Faire?\\", Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 21 (2), (May, 1989), pp. 221‚Äì31, in JSTOR. As a joint-stock company the British Linen Company had the right to raise funds through the issue of promissory notes or bonds. With its bonds functioning as bank notes, the company gradually moved into the business of lending and discounting to other linen manufacturers, and in the early 1770s banking became its main activity.C. A. Malcolm, The History of the British Linen Bank (Edinburgh: T. & A. Constable, 1950), . =Transport= The extensive Scottish coastline meant that few parts of the country that were not within easy reach of sea transportation, particularly the central belt that would be the heartland of industrial development. Before the eighteenth century most roads were relatively poor dirt tracks. In the late eighteenth century there were improvements carried out by turnpike trusts and the creation of a series of military roads. Canal building also developed, with four major lowland canals: the Forth and Clyde, Union, Monkland and Crinan and further north the Paisley, Caledonian and Inverurie canals, carrying thousands of passengers and tons of goods by the early nineteenth century.A. J. Durie, \\"Movement, transport and tourism\\" in T. Griffiths and G. Morton, eds, A History of Everyday Life in Scotland, 1800 to 1900 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), , p. 149. =Exports= Ships off Greenock, Scotland (1813) by Robert Salmon With tariffs with England abolished, the potential for trade for Scottish merchants was considerable, especially with Colonial America. However, the economic benefits of union were very slow to appear, primarily because Scotland was too poor to exploit the opportunities of the greatly expanded free market. Scotland in 1750 was still a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3 million.H. Hamilton, An Economic History of Scotland in the Eighteenth Century (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963). Furthermore, Scotland's economy had been ravaged by the Darien scheme: according to some estimates, half of all the circulating wealth in Scotland went into the scheme. Glasgow merchants had been particularly enthusiastic, and consequently had no ships of their own for twenty years following the disaster.Alan Massie, Glasgow: Portraits of a City (Barrie & Jenkins, 1989), p. 21-2. Some progress was visible, such as the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow after 1740. The clippers belonging to the Glasgow Tobacco Lords were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia.M. Lester, \\"The Tobacco Lords: A study of the Tobacco Merchants of Glasgow and their Activities\\", Virginia Historical Society Vol. 84, No. 1 (1976), in JSTOR, p. 100. The trade had started as smuggling during the 1600s, but with the Act of Union, it became legal and trade picked up.Michael Meighan, Glasgow: A History (Amberley Publishing, 2013), p. 21. Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glassworks, breweries, and soapworks, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial centre after 1815.T. M. Devine, \\"The Colonial Trades and Industrial Investment in Scotland, c. 1700‚Äì1815,\\" Economic History Review, Feb 1976, vol. 29 (1), pp. 1‚Äì13. The tobacco trade collapsed during the American Revolution (1776‚Äì83), when its sources were cut off by the British blockade of American ports. However, trade with the West Indies began to make up for the loss of the tobacco business,R. H. Campbell, \\"The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707. II: The Economic Consequences,\\" Economic History Review, April 1964 vol. 16, pp. 468‚Äì477 in JSTOR. reflecting the extensive growth of the cotton industry, the British demand for sugar and the demand in the West Indies for herring and linen goods. During 1750‚Äì1815, 78 Glasgow merchants not only specialised in the importation of sugar, cotton, and rum from the West Indies, but diversified their interests by purchasing West Indian plantations, Scottish estates, or cotton mills. They were not to be self-perpetuating due to the hazards of the trade, the incident of bankruptcy, and the changing complexity of Glasgow's economy.T. M. Devine, \\"An Eighteenth-Century Business √âlite: Glasgow-West India Merchants, c 1750‚Äì1815,\\" Scottish Historical Review, April 1978, vol. 57 (1), pp. 40‚Äì67. Other burghs also benefited. Greenock enlarged its port in 1710 and sent its first ship to the Americas in 1719, but was soon playing a major part in importing sugar and rum.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , p. 296. =Linen= New Lanark, cotton mills and housing on the River Clyde, founded in 1786 Linen manufacture was Scotland's premier industry in the eighteenth century and formed the basis for the later cotton, jute,L. Miskell and C. A. Whatley, \\"'Juteopolis' in the Making: Linen and the Industrial Transformation of Dundee, c. 1820‚Äì1850,\\" Textile History, Autumn 1999, vol. 30 (2), pp. 176‚Äì98. and woollen industries.A. J. Durie, \\"The Markets for Scottish Linen, 1730‚Äì1775\\", Scottish Historical Review vol. 52, no. 153, Part 1 (April, 1973), pp. 30‚Äì49 in JSTOR. Scottish industrial policy was made by the Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland, which sought to build an economy complementary, not competitive, with England. Since England had woolens, this meant linen. The Scottish members of parliament managed to see off an attempt to impose an export duty on linen and from 1727 it received subsidies of ¬£2,750 a year for six years, resulting in a considerable expansion of the trade. Paisley adopted Dutch methods and became a major centre of production. Glasgow manufactured for the export trade, which doubled between 1725 and 1738.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 292‚Äì3. Encouraged and subsidised by the Board of Trustees, so that they could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market.Alastair Durie, \\"Imitation in Scottish Eighteenth-Century Textiles: The Drive to Establish the Manufacture of Osnaburg Linen,\\" Journal of Design History, 1993, vol. 6 (2), pp. 71‚Äì6. The British Linen Company, established in 1746, was the largest firm in the Scottish linen industry in the eighteenth century, exporting linen to England and America. In 1728, 2.2 million yards of linen cloth had been produced and by 1730 it had already supplanted woollen cloth as the major manufacturing industry. By 1750 it reached 7.6 million and it peaked at 12.1 million yards in 1775. However, there were sharp slumps, particularly in the periods 1734‚Äì43 and 1763‚Äì72. It was a mainly rural industry, with most of the manufacture carried out in homes, rather than factories. It employed perhaps 100,000 people, four out of five of which were women who spun the flax, while men operated the looms.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 381. The government promoted the use of linen from the late 17th century: a 1686 Act of Parliament stated that all Scots were to be buried in Scottish-made linen winding sheets, using Scottish flax. In 1748, an embargo on the import or use of French cambric provided a further boost to the linen industry. By 1770, Glasgow was the largest linen manufacturer in Britain, and in 1787, Calton, Glasgow was the site of Scotland's first industrial dispute when 7,000 weavers went on strike in protest against a 25% cut in their wages. The 39th Foot were sent in, and three people were killed.Michael Meighan, Glasgow: A History (Amberley Publishing, 2013), p. 47. Sheer linen, which had then come into vogue, was almost unobtainable in Scotland in the 1780s. In a bid to stay competitive, Glasgow manufacturers turned to fine cotton muslin, at which they succeeded so well that it became cheaper than imported Indian muslins.Margaret Swain, Scottish Embroidery: Medieval to Modern (BT Batsford, 1986), p. 95. With the popularity of Indian muslins, from the 1760s onwards, had come a fashion for tambour lace, or sewed muslin, which briefly became a flourishing business in Ayrshire, thanks to the enterprising spirit of Mrs Jamieson. Nineteenth century A lantern slide, showing later missionary David Livingstone (1813‚Äì73) as a cotton piercer around 1825 The economy, long based on agriculture, began to industrialize after 1790. At first the leading industry, based in the west, was the production of cotton. After the cutting off of supplies of raw cotton from 1861 as a result of the American Civil War the country diversified into engineering, shipbuilding, and locomotive construction, with steel replacing iron after 1870.O. Checkland and S. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832‚Äì1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), , p. 26. =Cotton= From about 1790 textiles became the most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving of cotton. The first cotton spinning mill was opened at Penicuik in 1778. By 1787 Scotland had 19 mills, 95 by 1795 and there were 192 by 1839. The rise of cotton was the result of a sudden fall in the price of the raw materials, mostly imported from the US, and the availability of a pool of cheap labour caused by population rise and migration. In 1775 137,000 lb of raw cotton were being imported into the Clyde and by 1812 it had increased eightfold to over 11 million lb. The capital invested in the industry increased sevenfold between 1790 and 1840. By 1800, cotton was the main industry in the Glasgow area: New Lanark mills were at the time the largest in the world.Michael Meighan, Glasgow: A History (Amberley Publishing, 2013), p. 48. Early production was aided by the new technology of the spinning mule, water frame and water power. Steam powered machines were introduced into the industry from 1782. However, only about a third of workers were employed in factories and it continued to rely heavily on the hand loom weaver, working in his own home. In 1790 there were about 10,000 weavers involved in cotton manufacture and by 1800 it was 50,000.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 384. The cotton industry flourished until in 1861 the American Civil War cut off the supplies of raw cotton.W. O. Henderson, The Lancashire Cotton Famine 1861‚Äì65 (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1934), p. 122. The industry never recovered, but by that time Scotland had developed heavy industries based on its coal and iron resources.C. A. Whatley, The Industrial Revolution in Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), , p. 51. =Coal= The headgear at Francis Colliery, Fife Coal mining became a major industry, and continued to grow into the twentieth century, producing the fuel to smelt iron, heat homes and factories and drive steam engines locomotives and steamships. Coal mining expanded rapidly in the eighteenth century, reaching 700,000 tons a year by 1750. Most coal was in five fields across the Central Belt. The first Newcomen Steam Engine was introduced into a Scottish colliery in 1719, but water remained the most important source of power for most of the century. With increased demand for household fuel from a growing urban population and the emerging demands of heavy industry, production grew from an estimated 1 million tons a year in 1775, to 3 million by 1830. Production almost doubled by the 1840s and peaked in 1914 at about 42 million tons a year.C. A. Whatley, \\"Economy: primary sector: 3 mining and quarrying\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 208‚Äì9. Initially increased production was made possible by the introduction of cheap labour, provided from the 1830s by large numbers of Irish immigrants. There were then changes in mining practices, which included the introduction of blasting powder in the 1850s and the use of mechanised methods of transferring the coal to the surface,W. Knox, Industrial Nation: Work, Culture and Society in Scotland, 1800‚Äìpresent (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press Series, 1999), , p. 105. along with the introduction of steam power in the 1870s.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 408. Landed proprietors were replaced by profit-seeking leasehold partnerships and joint-stock companies, whose members were often involved in the emerging iron industry.I. D. Whyte, \\"Economy: primary sector: 1 industry to 1770s\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 211‚Äì12. By 1914 there were a million coal miners in Scotland. The stereotype emerged early on of Scottish colliers as brutish, non-religious and socially isolated serfs;C. A. Whatley, \\"Scottish 'collier serfs', British coal workers? Aspects of Scottish collier society in the eighteenth century\\", Labour History Review, Fall 1995, vol. 60 (2), pp. 66‚Äì79. that was an exaggeration, for their life style resembled coal miners everywhere, with a strong emphasis on masculinity, egalitarianism, group solidarity, and support for radical labour movements.A. Campbell, The Scottish Miners, 1874‚Äì1939 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000), . =Iron and steel= Map of the Monkland Railways and surrounding lines in 1848 The invention of James Beaumont Neilson's hot blast process for smelting iron in 1828 revolutionised the Scottish iron industry, allowing abundant native blackstone iron ore to be smelted with ordinary coal. In 1830 Scotland had 27 iron furnaces and by 1840 it was 70, 143 in 1850 and it peaked at 171 in 1860. Output was over 2,500,000 tons of iron ore in 1857, 6.5 per cent of UK output. Output of pig iron rose from 797,000 tons in 1854 to peak at 1,206,00 in 1869.O. Checkland and S. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832‚Äì1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), , pp. 24‚Äì5. As a result, Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives. In the 1871 census, the workforce in heavy industry overtook textiles in the Strathclyde region and in 1891 it became the majority employer in the country. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, steel production largely replaced iron production.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 407. =Railways= Britain was the world leader in the construction of railways, and their use to expand trade and coal supplies. The first successful locomotive-powered line in Scotland, between Monkland and Kirkintilloch, opened in 1826. By the late 1830s there was a network of railways that included lines between Dundee and Arbroath, and connecting Glasgow, Paisley and Ayr. The line between Glasgow and Edinburgh, largely designed for passenger transport, opened in 1842 and proved highly successful. By the mid-1840s the mania for railways had begun.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 410. A good passenger service established by the late 1840s, and a network of freight lines reduced the cost of shipping coal, making products manufactured in Scotland competitive throughout Britain. The North British Railway was formed in 1844 to link Edinburgh and eastern Scotland with Newcastle and the next year the Caledonian Railway began connecting Glasgow and the west to Carlisle. The creation of a dense network in the Lowlands with connections to England would take until the 1870s to complete. A series of amalgamations meant that five main companies operated 98 per cent of the system by the 1860s. The capital invested in Scottish railways was ¬£26.6 million in 1859 and by 1900 it had reached ¬£166.1 million. The floatation of railway companies was a major factor in the formation of the Scottish stock exchanges and the rise of share holding in Scotland and after the early stages drew in large amounts of English investment.O. Checkland and S. G. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland, 1832‚Äì1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1989), , pp. 26‚Äì7. The travel time between Edinburgh or Glasgow and London was cut from 43 hours to 17 and by the 1880s it had been reduced to 8. Railways opened the London market to Scottish beef and milk. They enabled the Aberdeen Angus to become a cattle breed of worldwide reputation.O. Checkland and S. G. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland, 1832‚Äì1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1989), , pp. 17‚Äì52.W. Vamplew, \\"Railways and the Transformation of the Scottish Economy\\", Economic History Review, Feb 1971, vol. 24 (1), pp. 37‚Äì54. =Shipbuilding= Fairfield shipyard in Govan Shipbuilding on Clydeside (the river Clyde through Glasgow and other points) began when the first small yards were opened in 1712 at the Scott family's shipyard at Greenock.J. Shields, Clyde Built: a History of Ship-Building on the River Clyde (Glasgow: William MacLellan, 1949). Major firms included Denny of Dumbarton, Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Greenock, Lithgows of Port Glasgow, Simon and Lobnitz of Renfrew, Alexander Stephen and Sons of Linthouse, Fairfield of Govan, Inglis of Pointhouse, Barclay Curle of Whiteinch, Connell and Yarrow of Scotstoun. Equally important were the engineering firms that supplied the machinery to drive these vessels, the boilers and pumps and steering gear ‚Äì Rankin & Blackmore, Hastie's and Kincaid's of Greenock, Rowan's of Finnieston, Weir's of Cathcart, Howden's of Tradeston and Babcock & Wilcox of Renfrew.R. Johnston, Clydeside Capital, 1870‚Äì1920: a Social History of Employers (Tuckwell Press, 2000), . The biggest customer was Sir William Mackinnon, who ran five shipping companies in the nineteenth century from his base in Glasgow.J. Forbes Munro, Maritime Enterprise and Empire: Sir William Mackinnon and His Business Network, 1823‚Äì1893 (Boydell Press, 2003), , p. 494. The Vulcan works, owned by Robert Napier and Sons were the first to start the production of large passenger iron ships in the 1840s. In 1835 the Clyde produced only 5 per cent of the ship tonnage built in Britain. The transition from wooden to iron ships was an uneven one, with wooden ships still cheaper to build until around 1850 and the material continued to be used until the 1860s in ships with composite hulls, like the clipper the Cutty Sark, which was launched from Dumbarton in 1869. Cost also delayed the transition from iron to steel shipbuilding and as late as 1879 only 18,000 tons of steel-built shipping was launched on the Clyde, 10 per cent of all tonnage. A similar process occurred in means of propulsion with shifts from sail to steam and back again between the 1840s and the introduction of the more efficient steam turbine engine that became dominant in the mid-1880s. Tonnage increased by more than a factor of six between 1880 and 1914.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 409. Production peaked during the First World War and the term \\"Clyde-built\\" became synonymous with industrial quality.R. Finley, \\"Economy: 5 1850‚Äì1918, The Mature Economy\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 199‚Äì200. =Engineering architecture= The Forth Bridge on completion in 1890 The nineteenth century saw some major engineering projects including Thomas Telford's (1757‚Äì1834) stone Dean Bridge (1829‚Äì31) and iron Craigellachie Bridge (1812‚Äì14).C. Harvie, Scotland: A Short History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), , p. 133. In the 1850s the possibilities of new wrought- and cast-iron construction were explored in the building of commercial warehouses in Glasgow. This adopted a round-arched Venetian style first used by Alexander Kirkland (1824‚Äì92) at the heavily ornamented 37‚Äì51 Miller Street (1854) and translated into iron in John Baird I's Gardner's Warehouse (1855‚Äì56), with an exposed iron frame and almost uninterrupted glazing. Most industrial buildings avoided this cast-iron aesthetic, like William Spence's (1806?‚Äì83) Elgin Engine Works built in 1856‚Äì58, using massive rubble blocks.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , p. 254. The most important engineering project was the Forth Bridge, a cantilever railway bridge over the Firth of Forth in the east of Scotland, 14 kilometres (9 mi) west of central Edinburgh. Construction of a suspension bridge designed by Thomas Bouch (1822‚Äì80), was stopped after the collapse of another of his works, the Tay Bridge in 1847.I. B. Whyte, A. J. MacDonald and C. Baxter, John Fowler, Benjamin Baker, Forth Bridge (Axel Menges, 2nd edn., 1997), , p. 7. The project was taken over by John Fowler (1817‚Äì98) and Benjamin Baker (1840‚Äì1907), who designed a structure that was built by Glasgow-based company Sir William Arrol & Co. from 1883. It was opened on 4 March 1890, and spans a total length of . It was the first major structure in Britain to be constructed of steel;A. Blanc, M. McEvoy and R. Plank, Architecture and Construction in Steel (London: Taylor & Francis, 1993), , p. 16. its contemporary, the Eiffel Tower was built of wrought iron.J. E. McClellan and H. Dorn, Science And Technology in World History: An Introduction (JHU Press, 2nd edn., 2006), , p. 315. Impact =Population and urbanisation= A map of Glasgow, the \\"second city of the Empire\\", in 1878 The census conducted by the Reverend Alexander Webster in 1755 showed the inhabitants of Scotland as 1,265,380 persons.K. J. Cullen, Famine in Scotland: The \\"Ill Years\\" of the 1690s (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), , pp. 123‚Äì4. By the time of the first decadal census in 1801, the population was 1,608,420. It grew steadily in the nineteenth century, to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.A. K. Cairncross, The Scottish Economy: A Statistical Account of Scottish Life by Members of the Staff of Glasgow University (Glasgow: Glasgow University Press, 1953), p. 10. While population fell in some rural areas as a result of the agricultural revolution, it rose rapidly in the towns. Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow all grew by a third or more between 1755 and 1775 and the textile town of Paisley more than doubled its population.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 383. Scotland was already one of the most urbanised societies in Europe by 1800.W. Ferguson, The Identity of the Scottish Nation: An Historic Quest (1998) online edition. In 1800, 17 per cent of people in Scotland lived in towns of more than 10,000 inhabitants. By 1850 it was 32 per cent and by 1900 it was 50 per cent. By 1900 one in three of the entire population were in the four cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen. Glasgow emerged as the largest city. Its population in 1780 was 43,000, reaching 147,000 by 1820; by 1901 it had grown to 762,000. This was due to a high birth rate and immigration from the countryside and particularly from Ireland; but from the 1870s there was a fall in the birth rate and lower rates of migration and much of the growth was due to longer life expectancy.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , pp. 411‚Äì12. Glasgow was now one of the largest cities in the world, and it became known as \\"the Second City of the Empire\\" after London.J. F. MacKenzie, \\"The second city of the Empire: Glasgow ‚Äì imperial municipality\\", in F. Driver and D. Gilbert, eds, Imperial Cities: Landscape, Display and Identity (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2003), , pp. 215‚Äì23. Evidence of high infant mortality on an Edinburgh gravestone Dundee upgraded its harbour and established itself as an industrial and trading centre. Dundee's industrial heritage was based on \\"the three Js\\": jute, jam and journalism. East-central Scotland became too heavily dependent on linens, hemp, and jute. Despite the cyclical nature of the trade which periodically ruined weaker companies, profits held up well in the nineteenth century. Typical firms were family affairs, even after the introduction of limited liability in the 1890s. The profits helped make the city an important source of overseas investment, especially in North America. However, the profits were seldom invested locally, apart from the linen trade. The reasons were that low wages limited local consumption, and because there were no important natural resources; thus the Dundee region offered little opportunity for profitable industrial diversification.B. Lenman and Kathleen Donaldson, \\"Partners' Incomes, Investment and Diversification in the Scottish Linen Area 1850‚Äì1921\\", Business History, Jan 1971, vol. 13(1), pp. 1‚Äì18. The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis.C. H. Lee, Scotland and the United Kingdom: the Economy and the Union in the Twentieth Century (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1995), , p. 43. Mortality rates were high compared with England and other European nations. Evidence suggests a national death rate of 30 per 1,000 in 1755, 24 in the 1790s and 22 in the early 1860s. Mortality tended to be much higher in urban than rural settlements. The first time these were measured, 1861‚Äì82, in the four major cities these were 28.1 per 1,000 and 17.9 in rural areas. Mortality probably peaked in Glasgow in the 1840s, when large inflows of population from the Highlands and Ireland combined population outgrowing sanitary provision and combining with outbreaks of epidemic disease. National rates began to fall in the 1870s, particularly in the cities, as environmental conditions improved.M. Anderson, \\"Population patterns: 2 since 1770, in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 489‚Äì91. The companies attracted rural workers, as well as immigrants from Catholic Ireland, by inexpensive company housing that was a dramatic move upward from the inner-city slums. This paternalistic policy led many owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class.J. Melling, \\"Employers, industrial housing and the evolution of company welfare policies in Britain's heavy industry: west Scotland, 1870‚Äì1920\\", International Review of Social History, Dec 1981, vol. 26 (3), pp. 255‚Äì301. =Class identity= The Carron Company trademark on the Carron Works, the objective of the 1820 Radical War One of the consequences of industrialisation and urbanisation was the development of a distinct skilled working class. W. H. Fraser argues that the emergence of a class identity can be located to the period before the 1820s, when cotton workers in particular were involved in a series of political protests and events. This led to the Radical War of 1820, in which a declaration of a provisional government by three weavers coincided with a strike by Glasgow cotton workers. The climax of the five-day war was a march from Glasgow Green to Falkirk to take control of the Carron Iron Works. It ended in a cavalry charge by government forces at Bonnymuir. The result was a discouragement of direct political action by workers, although attempts at political reform continued in movements like Chartism and the short hours movement in the 1830s.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , pp. 390‚Äì1. From the 1830s the political influence of the working classes was expanded through the widening of the franchise, industrial action and the growth and organisation of trade unionism. There were less than 5,000 eligible voters in Scotland before the 1832 Reform Act saw the enlargement of the franchise to include middle class men of business. The 1868 Act brought in skilled artisans and that of 1884 admitted many farm workers, crofters, miners and unskilled men. These changes were supported by trade unions,O. Checkland and S. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832‚Äì1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), , p. 66. which developed from the mid- century. Concerted industrial action was undertaken by spinners in the cotton industry in 1836-7 after a collapse of foreign markets led to wage cuts, but was ultimately defeated by the factory owners. The most sustained industrial action was in the mining industry, where the owners controlled employment as well as housing and retail trade through the truck system. In 1887 colliers in the west of Scotland won a major victory over both wages and rents.O. Checkland and S. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832‚Äì1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), , pp. 86‚Äì8. Scottish trade unionism in the nineteenth century differed from that in the rest of Britain in that unions were often small and highly localised and lacked higher industrial and national organisation.W. Kenefick, Red Scotland!: The Rise and Fall of the Radical Left, c. 1872‚Äì1932 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 8. Trade councils were established in Edinburgh in 1853 and in Glasgow in 1858 in an attempt to organise on a regional basis, but were often ineffectual.O. Checkland and S. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832‚Äì1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), , p. 89. The new unionism of the last two decades of the century saw the dockers and railwaymen organise a network of regional and national support, but this began to wain towards the end of the century and the situation of union parochialism would remain the dominant mode until union amalgamations got under way after 1914.W. Kenefick, Red Scotland!: The Rise and Fall of the Radical Left, c. 1872‚Äì1932 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 9. =Women= Illustration of power loom weaving in 1835, showing an idealised view of women working in a clean and spacious environment The industrialisation of Scotland had a major impact of the roles of women. Women and girls formed a much higher proportion of the workforce than elsewhere in Britain and were the majority of workers in some industries. The expansion of flax spinning and the rise of linen industry in the eighteenth century was almost totally dependent on female labour and the situation was similar in the sewed muslin industry in the West of Scotland towards the end of the century. When flax spinning became mechanised the proportion of men to women was 100:280, the highest proportion of women in the United Kingdom. In Dundee in the 1840s, while male employment increased by a factor of 1.6, female employment went up by 2.5, making it the only large town in Scotland with the majority of its female population in paid employment. In cotton in the nineteenth century women and girls accounted for 61 per cent of the workforce in Scottish mills, compared with 50 per cent in Lancashire. Although most women were employed in the textile industries, they were also a significant proportion of the workforce in other areas, making up 12 per cent of underground workers in mining, compared with 4 per cent in Britain overall.C. A. Whatley, The Industrial Revolution in Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), , pp. 74‚Äì5. The expanded opportunities for women, and the extra income they and children brought into the household, probably did the most to help increase living standards for working-class families.C. A. Whatley, The Industrial Revolution in Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), , p. 83. The role of women in workforce peaked in the 1830s. As heavy industry began to dominate there were less opportunities for women. From the mid-nineteenth century there were a series of laws that limited female roles in industry, beginning with the Mines Regulation Act of 1842, which prevented them from working underground. This put 2,500 women out of work in the east of Scotland, causing real hardship as their contribution to the family economy was vital. This was followed by a series of factory acts that placed restrictions on the employment of women. Many of these acts were brought in because of pressure from trade unions who were attempting to secure a living wage for their male members. Women had relatively little involvement in official trade unions for much of the period of industrialisation. However, they were frequently involved in unofficial disputes, the first being recorded in 1768 and of which there are known to have been 300 strikes that involved women between 1850 and 1914. Towards the end of the century there were increasing attempts to unionise women. The Scottish Women's Trade Council (SWTC) was formed in 1887. From this emerged the Women's Protective and Provident League (WPPL) and the Glasgow Council for Women's Trades (GCWT). In 1893, the National Federal Council of Scotland for Women's Trades (NFCSWT) was established and the Scottish Council for Women's Trades (SCWT) in 1900. By 1895 the NFCSWT alone had an affiliated membership of 100,000.Y. Brown, \\"Women: 1770s onwards\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), , pp. 647‚Äì50. =Migration= \\"First Scottish Colony for New Zealand\\" ‚Äì 1839 poster advertising emigration from Scotland to New Zealand The growth of industry resulted in the arrival of large numbers of workers from Ireland who moved into the factories and mines in the 1830s and 1840s. Many were seasonal workers employed as navvies on the construction of docks, canals and then railways. An estimated 60‚Äì70 per cent of colliers in Lanarkshire were Irish by the 1840s. The arrivals intensified with the Potato famine of 1845.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 395. By the census of 1841, 126,321, or 4.6 per cent of Scotland's population, had been born in Ireland and many more were of Irish descent. Most were concentrated in the west of Scotland, and in Glasgow there were 44,000 people who were born in Ireland, 16 per cent of the city's population.W. Knox, Industrial Nation: Work, Culture and Society in Scotland, 1800‚Äìpresent (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1999), , p. 37. Most Irish immigrants, about three quarters, were Catholic, leading to a major cultural and religious change in Scotland, but a quarter were Protestant, eventually bringing with them institutions like the Orange Order and intensifying a sectarian divide in the major cities.J. McCaffery, \\"Immigration, Irish\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 331‚Äì3. Even with the growth of industry there were insufficient good jobs, which with major changes in agriculture, meant that during the period 1841‚Äì1931, about two million Scots emigrated to North America and Australasia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.R. A. Houston and W. W. Knox, eds, The New Penguin History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 2001), , p. xxxii. Of those who migrated to non-European locations in the century before 1914, 44 per cent went to the US, 28 per cent to Canada, and 25 per cent to Australia and New Zealand. Other important locations included the Caribbean, India and South Africa.M. D. Harper, \\"Emigration: 4 post-1750, excluding Highlands\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 232‚Äì4. By the twenty-first century, there were about as many people who were Scottish Canadians and Scottish Americans as the five million remaining in Scotland. There was little support from the government and in the early stages many migrants agreed to indentures, particularly to the thirteen colonies, that paid for their passage and guaranteed accommodation and work for five or seven years. Later immigration was assisted by agents and societies, such as the Salvation Army, Barnados and the Aberdeen Ladies Union, who often focused on the young or female immigrants.

Background  Dwight was born in Catskill, New York on April 8, 1827. His father was Benjamin W. Dwight, a doctor (son of Timothy Dwight IV, President of Yale College and a member of the noted Dwight family of New England) and later treasurer of Hamilton College. His mother was Sophia (Strong) Dwight. He was the youngest of six children: Benjamin, Theodore, Sophia, Mary, Elizabeth, and Edward. Edward Dwight left home at the age of 15, went to Boston, Massachusetts and signed up on the whaling schooner Council, which returned to Boston after sailing the Atlantic Ocean for one year. He then went to Clinton, Oneida County, New York, and worked on a farm there until 1847, when he left for the Wisconsin Territory (in May of that year he had married Elizabeth Foote of Clinton, daughter of John and Mary (Love) Foote). They traveled via the Great Lakes to Racine, then got a ride on a lumber wagon to a place called \\"Walnut, Wisconsin\\" (some sources say Spring Prairie). This \\"Walnut\\" may or may not be identified with Walnut Springs, Wisconsin, a short-lived post office which operated for a couple of decades in the Town of Adams in Green County on the road between Madison and Wiota.  Wisconsin and Iowa and Wisconsin again  He worked in Walnut by the month, saving up enough that he could buy 160 acres (one-quarter of a square mile) at $8 per acre. He made some improvements on the land, then sold it and bought a 40-acre tract nearby, sold that and bought more land. In 1855 he went to Iowa by ox team; he became one of the pioneers of Winneshiek County, Iowa, buying 360 acres from the U.S. government land office, 160 of which had already been improved. He stayed in Iowa only one year, then returned to \\"Walnut\\", where he stayed for a further year before he came to Dane County, Wisconsin in or near Oregon, Wisconsin, and bought another tract of land, which he would farm for many years. There was a log house on the land, where the family camped for a few years. He planted fruit and shade trees, and erected some frame buildings.Biographical Review Publishing Company.

Politics  Dwight was active in the Republican Party, held various offices, and was elected to a single one-year term in the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1860. Dane County had one less seat in the subsequent Assembly, and Dwight did not return. After the American Civil War, Dwight spent a great deal of time studying financial questions; as a result, in 1880 Dwight served as a United States Presidential elector for the Greenback Party.

Following the Cuban Revolution and the overthrow of the US- friendly government of Fulgencio Batista, the United States became concerned with the spread of the Soviet Union's influence in Latin America, becoming heavily invested in retaining as much influence as possible. With the nuclear arms race at its peak, a Soviet transfer of nuclear warheads to its Latin American ally in Cuba nearly concluded in the onset of World War III in October 1962. Afterward, the United States hardened its influence throughout Latin America, involving itself in what became known as the \\"Dirty War\\", a process that involved questionable actions including supporting or overthrowing governments depending on political leaning, supporting subversive groups such as the Contras with weaponry and funding, or participating in controversial operations such as Operation Charly and Operation Condor. The fallout from these actions affect Latin America‚ÄìUnited States relations to this day. Having been annexed from Spain in 1898, the unincorporated territory of Puerto Rico represented a paradox during the Cold War, politically belonging to the United States but culturally to Latin America. Its location in the Caribbean converted it in the American response to Cuba, directly affecting the development of its political status. Puerto Rico was allowed to enact a heavily revised local Constitution, but its attempts to employ its sovereignty and use it to remove the application of the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution ended in failure. The United States military played a key role in perpetuating the status quo, not wanting to risk the possibility that a change in status could affect their presence in the Caribbean. A situation further complicated by the emergence of Marxist guerrillas, including the notorious Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci√≥n Nacional Puertorrique√±a and Boricua Popular Army, within the pre-existing independence movement in Puerto Rico. Ultimately, the status issue stagnated throughout the remainder of the Cold War, but the pro-sovereignty efforts undertaken during this time frame eventually led to the current incarnation of the free association movement in Puerto Rico. Background =Marxist expansion in Latin America= Throughout much of Latin America, reactionary oligarchies ruled through their alliances with the military elite and United States. Although the nature of the U.S. role in the region was established many years before the Cold War, the Cold War gave U.S. interventionism a new ideological tinge. But by the mid-20th century, much of the region passed through a higher state of economic development, which bolstered the power and ranks of the lower classes. This left calls for social change and political inclusion more pronounced, thus posing a challenge to the strong U.S. influence over the region's economies. In Cuba, the July 26 Movement seized power in January 1959, toppling President Fulgencio Batista, whose unpopular regime had been denied arms by the Eisenhower administration. Diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States continued for some time after Batista's fall, but President Eisenhower deliberately left the capital to avoid meeting Cuba's young revolutionary leader Fidel Castro during the latter's trip to Washington in April, leaving Vice President Richard Nixon to conduct the meeting in his place. Cuba began negotiating arms purchases from the Eastern Bloc in March 1960. In January 1961, just prior to leaving office, Eisenhower formally severed relations with the Cuban government. In April 1961, the administration of newly elected American President John F. Kennedy mounted an unsuccessful CIA-organized ship-borne invasion of the island at Playa Gir√≥n and Playa Larga in Las Villas Provincea failure that publicly humiliated the United States. Castro responded by publicly embracing Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, and the Soviet Union pledged to provide further support. By the 1960s, Marxists gained increasing influence throughout the regions, prompting fears in the United States that Latin American instability posed a threat to U.S. national security. Latin American revolutionaries shifted to guerrilla tactics, heavily influenced by the Cuban Revolution. Arbenz fell when his military had deserted him. Since then, some future Latin American social revolutionaries and Marxists, most notably Fidel Castro and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua made the army and governments parts of a single unit and eventually set up single party states. Overthrowing such regimes would require a war, rather than a simple CIA operation, the landing of Marines, or a crude invasion scheme like the Bay of Pigs Invasion. =American involvement= Throughout the Cold War years, the U.S. acted as a barrier to socialist revolutions and targeted populist and nationalist governments that were aided by the communists. The CIA overthrew other governments suspected of turning pro-communist, such as Guatemala in 1954 under Jacobo Arbenz Guzman. The CIA Operation PBSuccess eventually led to the 1954 coup that removed Arbenz from power. The operation drew on an initial plan first considered in 1951 to oust Arbenz named Operation PBFortune. Arbenz, who was supported by some local communists, was ousted shortly after he had redistributed of United Fruit Company land in Guatemala. United Fruit had long monopolized the transportation and communications region there, along with the main export commodities, and played a major role in Guatemalan politics. Arbenz was out shortly afterwards, and Guatemala came under control of a repressive military regime. A U.S. Navy P-2 of VP-18 flying over a Soviet freighter during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Continuing to seek ways to oust Castro following the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Kennedy and his administration experimented with various ways of covertly facilitating the overthrow of the Cuban government. Significant hopes were pinned on a covert program named the Cuban Project, devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961. In February 1962, Khrushchev learned of the American plans regarding Cuba: a \\"Cuban project\\"approved by the CIA and stipulating the overthrow of the Cuban government in October, possibly involving the American militaryand yet one more Kennedy-ordered operation to assassinate Castro.Zubok, Vladislav M. (1994). \\"Unwrapping the Enigma: What Was Behind the Soviet Challenge in the 1960s?\\". In Diane B. Kunz (Ed.), The Diplomacy of the Crucial Decade: American Foreign Relations During the 1960s. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 158‚Äì159. . Preparations to install Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba were undertaken in response. Alarmed, Kennedy considered various reactions, and ultimately responded to the installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba with a naval blockade and presented an ultimatum to the Soviets. Khrushchev backed down from a confrontation, and the Soviet Union removed the missiles in return for an American pledge not to invade Cuba again. Castro later admitted that \\"I would have agreed to the use of nuclear weapons....we took it for granted that it would become a nuclear war anyway, and that we were going to disappear.\\"James G. Blight (2002), Cuba on the Brink: Castro, the Missile Crisis, and the Soviet Collapse, Rowman & Littlefield, p. 252. The Cuban Missile Crisis (October‚ÄìNovember 1962) brought the world closer to nuclear war than ever before. It further demonstrated the concept of mutually assured destruction, that neither superpower was prepared to use their nuclear weapons, fearing total global destruction via mutual retaliation. The aftermath of the crisis led to the first efforts in the nuclear arms race at nuclear disarmament and improving relations, although the Cold War's first arms control agreement, the Antarctic Treaty, had come into force in 1961.National Research Council Committee on Antarctic Policy and Science, p. 33 In 1964, Khrushchev's Kremlin colleagues managed to oust him, but allowed him a peaceful retirement. Accused of rudeness and incompetence, he was also credited with ruining Soviet agriculture and bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war. Khrushchev had become an international embarrassment when he authorized construction of the Berlin Wall, a public humiliation for Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. History =The PPD and the pursuit of sovereign association= The pursuit of sovereignty within the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) can be traced to the moment of its foundation. The organization was originally created to support the independence of Puerto Rico, following the division of the Liberal Party. Among the party's early leaders were Mu√±oz and Antonio Fern√≥s-Isern, both supporters of Puerto Rican independence. Within the PPD, the concept of an Estado Libre Asociado (lit. \\"Associated Free State\\") was conceived by Fern√≥s as an sovereign body associated to the United States by mutual consent. He first presented his idea of a sovereign association that preserved a common coin, citizenship and market access in a press article published in 1939. Fern√≥s declared that Puerto Rico had a right to acquire its sovereignty and as such, could also delegate part of it as long as it was on equal juridical and moral terms. He proposed a model which allowed a proper nationality that was associated, but not subordinated to the other. The proposal intended to negotiate which rights and responsibilities each side would retain through an \\"bilateral organic pact\\". The idea took some inspiration from Ancient Greece, where deferent states would enter into confederations in order to cooperate in common interests. Like its Liberal Party predecessor, this proposal was also influenced by the British model. Fern√≥s argued that the Commonwealth realm relationship between Canada and the United Kingdom surpassed a simple form of autonomy, instead being a kind of association superior to any status that would keep the sovereignty of Puerto Rico in the hands of Congress. He considered his proposal a \\"free federated commonwealth\\" and a \\"republic lacking international relations\\", which would be freely delegated to the Federal Government of the United States. Among other observations, Fern√≥s also noted how ridiculous it was to see the United States Congress hold the sovereignty of Puerto Rico when it wasn't the sovereign of the United States or its people and only served as a representative of the popular vote. He ultimately condemned the idea of a status where sovereignty was forfeit in favor of autonomy, comparing such an arrangement to a monarchy. The following year, Fern√≥s analyzed the complications of directly transitioning from the colonial economic model established by the United States and listed what he considered could be possible steps for a prosperous sovereignty. On July 21, 1940, the founding assembly for the new party was held with the collaboration of 2,000 delegates. Fern√≥s, who thought that the socio-economic issues should be attended first, was largely responsible for drafting the respective part of the party's program, being joined by Vicente G√©igel Polanco and Rafael Arjona Siaca. Inspired by a painting by Ram√≥n Frade named \\"El Pan Nuestro\\", he proposed the j√≠baro as the party's mascot and also coined the \\"Partido Popular\\" part of the name, which was completed in a reunion to earn its current name, Popular Democratic Party. For the following years, Fern√≥s played a key role within the PPD, most notably in its legislation and finances. He reluctantly ran for the position of Resident Commissioner at the 1940 general elections. In 1945, Mu√±oz led a local Commission that later became involved in the process to create a third option that fell between independence and statehood, the similarly defined \\"Dominion\\" status authored by Vicente G√©igel Polanco. Despite these advances, Fern√≥s continued elaborating his ever-evolving model for a \\"third option\\". In 1946, Fern√≥s noted that as part of the ongoing process, Congress had to openly express its willingness to renounce the sovereignty of Puerto Rico that it had acquired through the Treaty of Paris, thus allowing the archipelago to create a proper self-government. Furthermore, he argued that the transfer of sovereignty that took place in 1898 should be invalidated. Despite the veto of appointed American governor Rexford Tugwell, the PPD's legislature approved a two projects towards this goal, one supporting a status referendum and the other supporting the nomination of a Puerto Rican to the office of governor, only to receive the veto of president Harry S. Truman. In July 1946, Tugwell abandoned the office of governor. Pi√±ero was then appointed as the new governor, the first Puerto Rican to do so under American colonial rule. The Estado Libre Asociado as conceived by Fern√≥s was focused on the internationalization of Puerto Rico rather that its growth within the limitations imposed by the Constitution of the United States, as exposed in an article published by him on July 2, 1946, where he discussed the type of relation that should be established with the rest of the world. The most notable example is his argument that the economy needed to evolve from the bilateral terms of the territorial clause to a multilateral model that allowed for better trade options. Fern√≥s also supported the conservation of the economic aspects of the Foraker Law that would benefit Puerto Rico over the countries that lacked a formal form of association. Among the perceived advantages was free commerce and the partial devolution to the Puerto Rican Treasury of the earnings gathered from the sale of local products. The following day these terms were supported by the PPD's leadership, establishing the party's ideological tendency as one of support to a form of association that relied on reclaiming the national sovereignty of Puerto Rico. That same year, Fern√≥s was elected Resident Commissioner for the PPD and began promoting that Puerto Rico reclaimed its sovereignty from the United States Congress, while also conserving an economic link between both. Once in Washington, he created friendships with several Congressmen and functionaries of the United States Department of the Interior (DOI), which went on to become influential allies. While in office, the appointment of Mariano Villaronga to the office of Commissioner of Instruction of Puerto Rico. This took place while the pro- statehood factions argued that the public education should be in English in order to facilitate a future admission. However, Villaronga supported the use of the established Spanish language. Understanding the implications that this had on the status of Puerto Rico, Fern√≥s sided with Villaronga, noting that conserving the Spanish language played a key role in conserving the Puerto Rican cultural identity. His arrival also coincided with the proposal of Public Law 362, which amended the Jones Law to allow Puerto Ricans the right to elect their own governor. Fern√≥s firmly supported these initiatives, believing that it was instrumental towards establishing a sovereign constitution in the near future and played a key role in its approval, turning Puerto Rico into the first territory to democratically elect a governor. While remaining Mu√±oz's main contact in Washington, Fern√≥s also developed an interest in the process that created an Organic Act for Guam, a long-standing military possession with parallels to his own case. He pushed status language that would later be used as precedent when attending Puerto Rico's status. Between 1945 and 1950, Fern√≥s modified his status proposal a total of 28 times. His efforts were supported by a parallel initiative undertaken by the DOI that tried to harmonize the public policy on territories with the anti- colonialism treaties that the United States reached with the United Nations. Fern√≥s coincided with most of what the DOI proposed, but refused the imposition of organic laws approved by Congress, believing that the political organization of the territories was an internal affair that must be based on the recognition of their respective sovereignties. In a 1947 draft titled \\"An act to establish the People of Puerto Rico as a self-governing community\\", Fern√≥s included language that would exclude Puerto Rico from the Laws of Cabotage. On August 5, 1947, the Butler-Crawford Elective Governor Law was approved, allowing Puerto Rico the option to democratically elect a governor for the first time since the United States invaded. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n became the one elected in representation of the PPD. Fern√≥s argued that these changes were insufficient, citing that the Organic Act that allowed Congress to nullify local laws should be abolished and that only the Federal Laws that benefited Puerto Rico should apply locally. He subsequently stated that these changes were only a return to the degree of self-government previously granted by the Carta Auton√≥mica (lit. \\"Autonomous Charter\\") approved by Spain in 1897. Additionally, he demanded the democratization of other institutions that remained under federal jurisdiction and that the control of aduanas was transferred to the Puerto Rican Treasury. Fern√≥s continued his pursuit of sovereignty by pursuing the creation of a local Constitution that was completely redacted, lacking \\"colonial vestiges\\" including unwanted Federal Laws, unmodified and presented by democratically elected representatives of the Puerto Rican people, with the support of the popular vote. A local Constitution would also be a cornerstone of an adequate form of association and so was the establishment of local self-government via the democratic election of a governor. However, these would only serve as steps towards the final goal of reclaiming the national sovereignty of Puerto Rico. The following year, he noted that the will of most Puerto Ricans was to create a system that would erase all vestiges of colonialism. Fern√≥s called his vision commonwealth soberano (lit. \\"sovereign commonwealth\\"), a midpoint status that he expected would \\"liquidate\\" the colonial regimen and perfect the economic relation between Puerto Rico and the United States. The Constitution drafted by the Puerto Ricans would be considered an \\"Organic Pact\\" that could only be modified via mutual consent. On August 15, 1948, the PPD officially adopted the organization of a Constituent Assembly as part of its government program. Shortly afterwards, Fern√≥s appeared in a radio broadcast explaining his proposal, claiming that full independence was not possible at the moment due to opposition in Congress and that statehood would be impossible for a prolonged time period. He once again discussed the relation existing between the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth realms and argued in favor of a similar relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States. Of particular interest to Fern√≥s was the elimination of the Cabotage laws. This coincided with the Truman administration's adoption of Article 73 of the Charter of the United Nations, an initiative that pursued the self-determination for the territories that lacked self-government. The 1948 general elections took on a plebiscitary approach and saw Mu√±oz Mar√≠n support Fern√≥s' proposal to pursue a relation similar to the Commonwealth realms, although, he noted that it should only serve as a transition for independence or incorporation. However, taking inspiration on Thomas Jefferson's Northwest Ordinance, the party's president also wished to launch a project containing disposition and articles in the nature of a \\"compact\\", \\"forever to remain unalterable unless by common interest\\", a language that he added to Fern√≥s's proposal. During the final months of 1949, Fern√≥s discussed the final version of his project with Mu√±oz and the following year, the document was reviewed by a PPD Committee. The project underwent one final revision before being formally presented to the United States House of Representatives. However, during the subsequent process the draft bill was dissected and underwent a series of complete revisions to the draft, which took place at the Mayflower hotel. There, Fern√≥s took a cautious approach, focusing on the initial approval of the bill. After approaching the members of several Congressional committees and sub- committees, he presented H.R. 7674 on March 13, 1950. After another revision, the bill was unanimously approved in the US Senate and received the opposition of Rep. Vito Marcantonio in the US House. Marcantonio remained its most vocal opposition, arguing that in practice Congress was not really granting Puerto Rico the complete sovereignty required to vanquish its colonial status. On the other hand, Fern√≥s felt that if Congress could return full sovereignty to the Philippines, they could grant the partial sovereignty that his original proposal pursued to Puerto Rico, which in turn would voluntarily delegate the remainder. He conceded that in the heavily amended version, the majority of Puerto Rico's sovereignty would remain in Congress as established in the Treaty of Paris. However, he still believed that the sovereignty gained by the United States through the Treaty of Paris was still limited, since he considered that they could not surpass the control retained by Spain with the establishment of the 1876 Constitution and the 1897 Charter of Autonomy. Truman signed the bill on July 3, 1950, and it became Public Law 600, which was approved in a referendum the following year and officially adopted as the Constitution of Puerto Rico. The degree of sovereignty acquired by Puerto Rico -if any- became a hot topic among local politicians. The process had damaged Fern√≥s's proposal, with cornerstones such as a multilateral economy and exception from the Cabotage Laws being stripped by Congress. Mu√±oz considered that the law turned the semi-autonomous government was now the co-holder of said sovereignty. On July 3, 1951, the organization of a Constituent Convention was made official and Fern√≥s was selected as its president. This process selected the two names for the political model that would be associated with the Constitution of Puerto Rico; in English the generic term \\"Commonwealth\\", in Spanish, the term Estado Libre Asociado (lit. \\" Freely Associated State\\") was selected, under the premise that no literal translation for \\"Commonwealth\\" exists in that language. On July 3, 1952, Truman signed Public Law 447 establishing the Commonwealth, which was inaugurated by Mu√±oz Mar√≠n 22 days later. =Failed attempts to secure sovereignty under the territorial clause= Conscious that the model approved by Congress diverted from his original creation by stripping it of sovereignty, Fern√≥s pursued a series of amendments that would complete the \\"sovereign association\\" that he conceived. However, in the years leading to this development, Mu√±oz systematically moved away from the common ideology that had joined him with Fern√≥s, eventually leading to a chism within the PPD that led to the exit of Vicente G√©igel Polanco and the creation of the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP). In June 1946, Mu√±oz published an article titled \\"Nuevos caminos hacia viejos objetivos\\", which redefined his concepts of \\"liberty\\" and \\"sovereignty\\", the later of which he defined as \\"an union of forces that produce the real power [required] to execute the people's will\\". This position began to establish an early contrast between him and Fern√≥s, who believed that sovereignty was a key aspect of his project. However, both ideologies were able to survive in parallel for some time. Following the Jayuya Uprising, Mu√±oz's public postures hardened and took a turn towards conservativism. However, Fern√≥s remained loyal to his liberal origins, likely beginning an ideological distancing, which was generally kept out of the public. The moves that followed were influenced by this breach, and were focused towards improving the level of sovereignty that Puerto Rico possessed. Despite considering it a transcendental accomplishment, Fern√≥s was not satisfied with this version and had previously told Mu√±oz that, once approved, it would \\"almost immediately\\" require \\"scrutiny to perfect it\\". His first proposal to change Law 600 was completed even before the model was implemented on March 27, 1952. Fern√≥s idealized a plan that consisted of systematically improving the degree of sovereignty by presenting a series of projects in Congress, referring to this work as the \\"pursuit of [the model's] perfection\\". Fern√≥s gained notoriety within Congress, also establishing a series of friendships with highly-influential congressmen, to whom he explained his pursuit of a form of sovereign association as the culmination of the Commonwealth's model. In 1953, Mu√±oz sent a letter to Truman arguing that the Commonwealth now possessed a complete form of self-government and requested that the case of Puerto Rico was removed from the United Nations' United Nations list of Non- Self-Governing Territories. A position supported by interim Secretary of Interior Vernon D. Northrop. Fern√≥s, as the project's creator, served as Alternate Delegate of the United States at the UN's Non-Self-Governing Territories Commission while the situation was being overseen. Following a prolonged debate, the United States managed to convince the United Nations to remove Puerto Rico from the Commission's scope with the argument that a new status -in association by mutual agreement [and] invested with political sovereignty ‚Äì had been reached. Parallel to this, Fern√≥s presented Joint Resolution 252 in the US House of Representatives, also known as the \\"Cosmetic Project\\", it was the first step to \\"perfect\\" his model. The bill intended to \\"fortify\\" the notion that Puerto Rico was no longer a territory or possession and directly focused in rewriting ambiguous sections of Public Law 600. The DOI supported it and so did the Congressional commissions that reviewed it. However, Mu√±oz suddenly ordered that it was removed from consideration. After this development, Fern√≥s and Mu√±oz held a series of conversations at Trujillo Alto, where their conflicting ideologies began to clash. These combined with strategic differences between both leaders, which only served to hindrance the \\"perfection of the association\\" as originally conceived. Matters were further complicated by the growing involvement of Mu√±oz's legal aides, Jos√© Trias Monge and Abe Fortas, who began taking over the legal aspect of the ideological definition. Fern√≥s was affected by these developments, but nonetheless continued his pursuit to reach the full constitutional development of Puerto Rico's status through its sovereignty. Between 1954 and 1960, Fern√≥s and several other figures realized a series if studies that intended to create a new project that would allow the Commonwealth to reach the development that he believed in. However, his involvement was often limited to his visits to Puerto Rico. In 1956, the PPD vowed to retake the status debate in order to \\"perfect\\" the Commonwealth. On March 23, 1959, H.R. 5926, colloquially known as the Fern√≥s Project, was presented before the US House of Representatives as requested. After a sister project was presented in the US Senate by James E. Murray, the collective bills became known as the Fern√≥s-Murray Project. This initiative intended to replace the Federal Relation Statute of Public Law 600 with a series of \\"association articles\\" and requested Congress to make it clear that Puerto Rico was no longer a territory or possession of the United States. The Fern√≥s-Murray Project also included the multilateral economy, as stated in the original concept of the Estado Libre Asociado. Another straggled proposal that it intended to revive was the exclusion of Puerto Rico from the Cabotage laws. The Fern√≥s-Murray Project also presented the possibility that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico could appeal directly to the United States Supreme Court. The bill was not well received, especially by the Federal military agencies and the Secretary of the Interior. The debate began in the United States House of Representative's Committee of Interior and Insular Affairs led by US Rep. Wayne Aspinall. The US Senate was intending to wait the US House's analysis, a development that favored Fern√≥s' strategy due to his reputation there. However, after the possibility of a pro-statehood referendum was considered, Mu√±oz decided to take a counterintuitive step and involved US Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson, leading to the Senate's action. By altering Fern√≥s's strategy, the process took a turn to the worst, when it conflicted with US Sen. Henry M. Jackson, the congressman directly in charge of the debate status within the Senate. In the subsequent public hearings, Jackson went on to become the notable figure to notice that under the Commonwealth, Puerto Rico was still under the jurisdiction of the territorial clause, exposing the contradictions between this fact and the case that the United States had presented before the United Nations. Now aware of this position, Fern√≥s reunited with Edward S. Corwin who offered a supporting opinion. Furthermore, a PPD reunion led by Mu√±oz further shifted the party's position to a more conservative posture, which was included in a revised bill that was presented before Congress in September 1959. This new posture, which discarded independence as a potential development and introduced an ambiguous support for future statehood \\"once the economic level matched that of other states\\", was responsible for introducing the term \\"permanent union\\" to the PPD's internal status debate and, as a direct consequence, began alienating Fern√≥s and his vision of a sovereign development. This decision was sorely taken by several members of the PPD due to its sudden turn towards the right and the term \\"permanent union\\" was criticized, being perceived as a synonym for \\"eventual statehood\\". Despite representing a significant conflict between the ideologies of his ideology and Mu√±oz's, Fern√≥s reluctantly included this language to the revised bill. Despite representing a contrast to his own beliefs, he was involved in the process, spending hours on it. On the other hand, Mu√±oz's own posture became even more conservative, leading to an argument in favor of allowing the residents of the territories to vote for the President of the United States, an act that would require an amendment to the United States Constitution and also served as an indirect recognition of the fact that Puerto Rico was still under the territorial clause. This led to an unintentional debate, where the tax exemptions of Puerto Rico, when compared to other territories, became a hot topic. Mu√±oz responded that once the economy allowed it, Puerto Rico would contribute to the Federal Government like the incorporated jurisdictions. This argument, which would place the Commonwealth even closer to statehood, was opposed by Fern√≥s who claimed that the economic relation between both parts should be akin to that of two countries, and as such, it unnecessary for one to cost the government expenses for the other. While the bill stalled in Congress, a local referendum was proposed by Fern√≥s with the intention of disabling the pro-statehood faction. The date of this referendum led to another conflict between both leaders and once again, the position of Mu√±oz prevailed. Meanwhile, Fern√≥s continued to work on the bill, gathering what he considered a positive outlook. However, Mu√±oz was bothered by a campaign launched by the pro-statehood Puerto Rican Republican Party criticizing it as \\"un-loyal, pro-independence [or] anti- american\\" and in a subsequent reunion suggested that the bill was completely ignored while that year's political campaign was underway. This represented yet another ideological difference between both. Fern√≥s drafted another version, but this priority on revalidating proved to be responsible for the failure of the Fern√≥s-Murray Project. On January 11, 1961, Mu√±oz requested that instead of continuing with this initiative, the Resident Commissioner was to present a different bill that eliminated the limitations on loan margins. Fern√≥s was the last member involved in the status revision to be informed of this change in strategy, which had been idealized by Arturo Morales Carri√≥n, a Puerto Rican that belonged to the United States delegation in the United Nations. This new initiative moved the focus away from Congress, the holder of Puerto Rico's sovereignty, to the executive power. The intention was to exploit the relation between Mu√±oz and the newly elected president John F. Kennedy, positioning Puerto Rico as a link between the United States and Latin America. This was a reactive measure taken only six days after Prime Minister of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev and President of Cuba Fidel Castro denounced that Puerto Rico remained a territory before the General Assembly of the UN. Fern√≥s was excluded of the process and shortly afterwards, Mu√±oz made it clear that no further revision of the status of Puerto Rico were planned in the near future. Despite this, the Resident Commissioner did present H.J.R. 124, requesting the elimination of the loan margin since it was something previously included in the Fern√≥s-Murray Project. The development of the status now fell on an executive order that would explain the Kennedy administration's position on the Commonwealth equivalent to a \\"memorandum of understanding\\" and which would move Puerto Rico's case away from the DOI. The status strategy would now focus on two proposals, the Executive Order & Memorandum and the informal and secretive Presidential Commission. In a letter sent to Chester Bowles, Mu√±oz admitted that the idea behind this strategy was not to actually change the status of Puerto Rico, but instead to disable the argument that Puerto Rico remained a colony, one that was \\"a weapon freely used by Communists, Fidelistas and enemies of the United States\\". =Mu√±oz, Fern√≥s and the demand for sovereignty= However, this campaign did no go as expected, the Legal Adviser of the Department of State did not support the notion that the Commonwealth could be an \\"inalterable pact\\" that could only be modified by mutual consent, recognizing the fact that Congress -as the holder of Puerto Rico's sovereignty- was capable of doing so unilaterally. This development triggered a sharp turn in Mu√±oz's ideology and strategy, which would lead to efforts to ensure that the Commonwealth's development was to be through its full sovereignty. This placed him in the same line of Fern√≥s for the first time in years. The strategy of both leaders would now be focused on acquiring concrete changes, instead of pushing partial measures. On February 10, 1961, Fern√≥s noted that the Commonwealth, as it stood, had an absence of democracy and shortly afterwards created another plan in line with the Fern√≥s- Murray Project. Despite all if the failed efforts, he still believed that the Commonwealth should mirror the relation of Canada and the United Kingdom and this was the right time to launch a pro-sovereignty campaign. The new plan became known as the Aspinall Project and its main key difference to the Fern√≥s-Murray Project was that in order to be implemented, the Senate was to renounce to all of the Commonwealth's sovereignty, resulting in the momentary creation of a Republic of Puerto Rico, which would then negotiate with Congress directly. This concept, known then as the \\"culminated\\" or \\"perfected Estado Libre Asociado\\" was consistent with the definition of free association approved by the United Nations on December 14, 1960, through UN General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV). However, the inclusion of statehood as an option in the referendum contemplated in the project did not sit well with Fern√≥s. Dr. Antonio Fern√≥s-Isern The failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion further complicated matters with the United States military, which was now focusing on reinforcing its presence in Puerto Rico. The United States Department of Defense became involved, requesting that even if Puerto Rico acquired the sovereignty desired, the military was to retain the capability of expropriating terrains that they considered strategic granted by the pre- existing eminent domain. Furthermore, there were plans to expand the United States Navy's presence in the municipalities of Vieques and Culebra. Despite attempts by the Puerto Rican government to moderate this, the Navy's plan went ahead unaltered. The process to launch the informal Presidential Commission was underway and the first version drafted by a group led by Mu√±oz completely abandoned the \\"permanent union\\" proposed years before, now adopting a \\"permanent association based on Puerto Rico's sovereignty\\". On the other hand, the governor also tried to prevent that the case of Puerto Rico was once again discussed before the General Assembly of the United Nations. This effort was led by Vicente Maura and Laura Meneses de Alb√≠zu in representation of Cuba. Mu√±oz felt that the Caribbean crisis could stagnate the project, but nonetheless favored its presentation. The draft discussed officially introduced the acts of sovereignty transfer and subsequent association as a simultaneous process. In January 1962, Arturo Morales Carri√≥n published an analysis arguing that the \\"free association\\" purported by Public Law 600 had to be re-examined due to having its origin in the obsolete laws of 1900 and 1917, also supporting the integration of Puerto Rico to the international community. In the following process, Mu√±oz would frequently employ the terms \\"sovereignty and association\\" to explain the goal of the project, also making a differentiation between it and full independence. There was consensus surrounding the demand for sovereignty, however, Fern√≥s felt that presenting all of their demands at once would present a high degree of complexity that could risk its approval in Congress, instead supporting a more concise approach. When the Puerto Rican and United States delegations met at the Commission, this concern was proven true. Despite the fact that efforts were done to inform the Americans of the steps planned, when both sides met their lack of awareness regarding the status of Puerto Rico was made apparent. Before a second set of reunions took place in Puerto Rico, Fern√≥s authored an analysis that tried to educate their counterparts. He and Jos√© Trias Monge pushed a two-stage process which would first acquire the sovereignty from Congress and would later employ it in a referendum, which would also include independence and statehood. After more changes were done to the language of the draft, the Puerto Rican delegation appeared ready to defend its initiative. The subsequent reunions led to a profound discussion, where the ambiguity of the territorial Commonwealth was noted by Harold R. Reis who was the American in charge of overseeing defense and economic relations. The Puerto Rican delegation made it clear that their intention was to gain the sovereignty of Puerto Rico and employ it to enter into an association with the United States, also expressing its intention to create its own exterior relations and join international organizations. Before the next reunion, several drafts were made and Mu√±oz presented them to presidential aides. After reading the drafts, Kennedy recognized that the Commonwealth \\"relationship [as presented in 1952 was] not perfected\\" and also requested some revisions. During the tenth Anniversary of the Constitution, Mu√±oz complicated the PPD's strategy by involving the Puerto Rican legislature and a local referendum, a step that frustrated Fern√≥s. This sudden decision had more side effects in Congress, where several legislators began questioning both the action that enabled Public Law 600 and a move towards association, which was called \\"sweetened independence\\" by opposers. Shortly afterwards, Mu√±oz took a sudden reactionary decision to qualm the claims of independence and reconsidered the term \\"permanent union\\" and the proposal supporting presidential vote, adding them the project despite the direct contradiction between these and any form of sovereign association. Fern√≥s believed this to be a serious mistake. Mu√±oz further complicated the proposal in an effort to calm the opposing pro- statehood faction, now proposing two related referendums, the first asking for an endorsement of the revision of the Commonwealth and a second one after Congress evaluated the options. Fern√≥s was concerned that this would dilate the process, especially since he thought that Congress was unlikely to offer a compromise in a process that would include the consideration of statehood. Mu√±oz then suggested that they went directly to a plesbicite that only considered independence, statehood and a generic \\"Commonwealth\\". On August 16, 1962, PdC No. 616 which adopted the governor's idea was presented in the Puerto Rico House of Representatives. Fern√≥s criticized the fact that the bill lacked the elements of the development that they had proposed towards a sovereign association; the referendum had been turned into a straw poll. This presented a notable contrast to what had been accorded with the Kennedy administration. After the project went to public hearings, Hiram Torres Rigual and Juan Manuel Garc√≠a Passalacqua presented Mu√±oz with an analysis of the deponent arguments which focused on the recognition of the sovereignty and the opposition to the presidential vote. Despite his disdain towards the way that the issue was being attended, Fern√≥s attempted to harmonize the local and federal processes. This bill was eventually removed and replaced with another. Parallel to this, the members of the informal Commission continued their research for a bill that developed the current status. =Complications caused by the Congress and Cold War= However, Reis' subsequent visit coincided with the Cuban Missile Crisis. With the sudden complication of the Cold War, Puerto Rico's role in the defense plan of the United States military was emphasized. This would have an impact in the negotiations, with Reis noting his concern about the implications that it would carry for defense and public policy. He recommended that all of the ideas were gathered in a draft. The document was completed by Tr√≠as Monge and opened by stating \\"the United States of America hereby relinquishes its sovereign rights in and to Puerto Rico and the adjacent islands and waters referred to in Article II of the Treaty of Peace signed at Paris on December 10, 1898, and proffers the following Articles of Compact as the basis of the association between the United States and Puerto Rico.\\" No longer were the ambiguous term \\"permanent union\\" or the possibility of a presidential vote present. A stage-bases process reminiscent of the one once proposed by Fern√≥s was also suggested in a note. However, Mu√±oz had another plan and requested the creation of other drafts, which despite being in part authored by Fern√≥s, now proposed that the initiatives were going to be presented in Congress before they were voted by the citizens of Puerto Rico. Before these were complete, the governor gave in to the demands of the Puerto Rico Republican Party and discarded using them, instead presenting his own draft which was further amended by the pro-statehood faction. This was considered a mayor victory for the integrationist party, who demanded and accomplished the re-inclusion of \\"permanent union\\" and the presidential vote, expecting that due to the consequent contradictions and the fact that Congress was unwilling to compromise before a popular vote the project would fail. The product of this reunion was the one used in the final version of Joint Resolution No.1 of December 3, 1962. Aware that the amendments of pro- statehood group would virtually guarantee its failure in Congress, Fern√≥s expressed inconformity about these changes. Mu√±oz reunited with all Puerto Rican members of the informal Commission and developed a strategy known as Operaci√≥n ELA, which attended all sorts of concerns that had appeared among Congressmen, from several inmovilistic arguments to the farfetched the possibility of \\"a communist advance\\". The implantation of this initiative included a supportive presidential message as well as several visits to members of Congress, journalists and even Nelson Rockefeller, all in an attempt to gain a positive outlook. In the second reunion of Operaci√≥n ELA, Mu√±oz introduced a position paper that was not well received by Fern√≥s, who once again reaffirmed that the goal was a \\"permanent association\\", since \\"permanent union\\" implied integration to the United States. The process was further dilated when the informal Commission suggested that the recommendations should be presented to the president before Congress. Mu√±oz consented, despite the protests of Tr√≠as, who argued that the Joint Resolution stated otherwise. As a consequence, another Presidential Commission was to be created, the Status Commission, with only minor involvement from Congress. In a reunion with president Kennedy, Mu√±oz admitted that the presidential vote was not really important to him. Aspinall joined Fern√≥s in believing that the project was becoming too complex and that would guarantee its failure in Congress. In February 1963, members of Operaci√≥n ELA held another reunion and the document that emerged from it applied the modifications proposed by the statehood movement but retained Fern√≥s' postures regarding sovereignty and association. The Resident Commissioner presented this draft to Aspinall, eventually reaching Reis, who presented a series of drafts. The third of these reached Fern√≥s and its liberal postures were consonant with his own, and he went on to analyze it and propose his own changes. Following extensive debate, the proposal was ultimately presented by Aspinall and received the code H.R. 5945. However, the evaluation process of the preliminary proposals was rocky and earned the critics of key figures such as US Sen. Henry M. Jackson. At the urgency of US Rep. Leo W. O'Brien, a member of the United States House Committee on Insular Affairs, who suggested it as a strategy to \\"facilitate\\" the approval of the project, Mu√±oz and Fern√≥s had decided to temporarily put aside the demand of sovereignty. Both Aspinall and O'Brien claimed that the final revision would be clear to include this aspect. However, this did not happen. Fern√≥s was forced to reluctantly accept a replacement -\\"inherent right and juridic capacity to enter into compacts\\"- in order to keep the proposal alive. As was the case when confronted with previous strategic obstacles, Mu√±oz distanced himself from the demand of sovereignty. His use of the term \\"permanent union\\" led to a confusion among Congressmen, who believed that only statehood could offer such option. However, this backfired when the PR Republican Party changed its posture and focused on attacking the Commonwealth and its possibilities of development. In representation of the Kennedy administration, Harold Seidman also warned against the use of the term \\"permanent union\\". Despite receiving some bipartisan support, H.R. 5945 experienced a problematic course in the US House, stalling for five months. The actions of Reis himself began indicating that he favored a change of strategy. Due to the failure of the complex version of the project, \\"brief\\" substitutive versions were presented, also officializing the inauguration of the Status Commission, a process led by the Resident Commissioner. Local politics saw the emergence of the reformist faction named Grupo de los 22 (lit. \\"The Group of the 22\\") within the PPD. The group pursued the reorganization of the PPD's structure and proposed several changes to the economic model. Despite its name, the group was large and included both liberals an conservatives. The faction was led by Juan Manuel Garcia Passalacqua, who since 1957 had been working on his own free association model. Other member include Severo Colberg Ramirez, Victoria Mu√±oz Mendoza, Jos√© Arsenio Torres, Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n, Marco Rigau, Samuel Silva Gotay and Noel Col√≥n Martinez. The Grupo de los 22 was bold in its approach, first sending a letter to Mu√±oz asking him to abandon the candidature for governor and to help bring forth a change in generation. While the faction clashed directly with the older members of the party, Mu√±oz was open to their proposals, including some in his final speech as governor titled El proposito de Puerto Rico (lit. \\"The purpose of Puerto Rico\\"). Feeling that the status issue was not advancing, the group drafted a proposal pursuing free association as defined in UN General Assembly Resolution 1514, which they intended to be included in the party's platform for the 1964 General Elections. On April 13, 1964, the participation of a Puerto Rican delegation within the Commission was made official. However, Fern√≥s did not participate in the nomination of candidates nor participated as an active member. Leaving a protect that promised to eliminate \\"all colonial vestiges\\", he decided not to pursue the re-election for the office of Resident Commissioner. Instead he opted to occupy an at-large seat in the Senate of Puerto Rico for the next four years. The project failed to provide any significant advances towards the resolution of the status of Puerto Rico and during the following years, the only notable action taken would be a non-binding referendum that did not produce any long-term reaction from Congress. On January 19, 1974, Fern√≥s died disappointed at the fact that he could not see the culmination of the sovereign association that he once visualized.

He led Apache from a small oil and gas concern to a conglomerate with interests in energy, commercial real estate, agriculture, manufacturing and telecommunications, then divested its non-energy assets to concentrate exclusively on oil and gas exploration and production. Under Plank‚Äôs leadership Apache expanded its oil and gas operations internationally and built the company from its original $250,000 capitalization to a market capitalization of over $30 billion. Plank invented the Master Limited Partnership and made it a personal and company mission to expose corruption at Enron and within the energy merchant trading sector. Early life and education Raymond Plank, the youngest of four siblings, was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to farmer and coal miner Raby Plank and Maude Ruth Howe Plank. His parents‚Äô schooling was limited but they instilled in their children the value of education, and Plank dedicated himself to a lifetime of learning. His mother died of a blood clot after a routine appendectomy when Plank was fifteen. Plank attended the Blake School in Minneapolis and credited his Latin instructor Noah Foss and other Blake teachers with providing the educational basis and academic discipline necessary for a successful life. Plank entered Yale University in September 1940 and after Pearl Harbor enlisted in the Army Air Corps Reserves. He was called to active duty in March 1943 and would not resume his university education until the end of the war. Plank graduated from Yale University in 1946 with a bachelor of arts degree.  World War II service  After flight school, Plank was assigned to the 43rd Bomb Group, 64th Bomb Squadron, in the Pacific Theater of Operations as a B-24 bomber pilot. He completed 40 missions; three of his aircraft were so badly damaged in combat that they never flew again. On August 9, 1945, while based in the Okinawas, Plank took an unauthorized check flight to witness the mushroom cloud rising over Nagasaki.  Apache Corporation  Upon graduation from Yale, Plank returned to his hometown of Minneapolis and with two partners formed Northwest Business Service, an accounting, tax and small business advisory firm. Through this enterprise, he became familiar with the types of investments then being offered in oil and gas exploration and production. Recognizing that investors‚Äô interests in this field could be better served through a different concept, Plank and two childhood friends, Truman Anderson and Chuck Aranao, formed Apache Corporation in 1954 with $250,000 in investor capital. Apache offered its first oil and gas investment program in 1956. Apache initially diversified beyond oil and gas into commercial real estate, purchasing office towers and shopping centers in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Apache‚Äôs real estate business achieved only minimal success, and when Oklahoma and Texas cut oil production allowables by as much as 90 percent in the late 1950s, the company sold off its real estate holdings and began acquiring successful entrepreneurial businesses including small telephone companies, an auto parts chain, the tree crop business and aerosol can and plastic pipe companies. Conflict in the Middle East, the rise of OPEC and America‚Äôs increasing dependence on foreign oil led Plank to revise Apache‚Äôs strategy once again in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The company gradually divested its non-energy holdings and by the late 1980s was focused exclusively on oil and gas. Apache funded much of its early growth through the creation of drilling funds, investment programs that provided significant tax advantages to unit holders. To provide its unit holders greater liquidity, in 1971 Apache formed Apache Exploration Company (Apexco) as the oil and gas operating arm of its drilling programs. Apexco was innovative in that it provided the first- ever vehicle for program participants to exchange their illiquid units for publicly traded stock. In 1981, under Plank‚Äôs leadership, Apache created Apache Petroleum Company (APC), the nation‚Äôs first master limited partnership (MLP). This new investment vehicle consolidated interests in 33 Apache oil and gas programs formed between 1959 and 1978. APC units were traded on the New York and Midwest Stock Exchanges, providing liquidity to unit holders while preserving the tax advantages of their original limited partnership interests. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 spelled the end of Apache‚Äôs drilling programs by reducing top marginal tax rates to the lowest levels since 1917, thereby undercutting the attractiveness of Apache‚Äôs drilling programs to high-income taxpayers. Apache offered its unit holders the opportunity to exchange their APC units for shares of Apache common stock. Over the next two decades, Apache grew rapidly by buying and exploiting property packages from the majors and extending its reach internationally, acquiring concessions in Egypt, Western Australia, China, the United Kingdom North Sea, Poland and Argentina. The company became one of the nation‚Äôs leading independent oil and gas concerns.  After Apache  Upon retiring as Chairman of Apache Corporation in January 2009, Plank dedicated his time to charitable work on behalf of Fund for Teachers, Ucross Foundation and to completing and publishing his memoirs, A Small Difference, in 2012. Proceeds from book sales support Fund for Teachers, the public foundation he founded in 2001.  Personal life  Plank was married three times. His first wife was Sally Stevens, with whom he had five children, Katherine, Michael, Pamela, Roger and Dana (Roger followed in his father‚Äôs footsteps at Apache, where he was named president and chief corporate officer in 2011 before retiring in 2014). Raymond Plank‚Äôs subsequent marriages were to Lollie Benz and Heather Burgess, with whom he had a sixth child, Raby.  Philanthropy and social/political involvement  Plank was the founder and former Chairman of the Board of the Ucross Foundation,Ucross Foundation which provides visual artists, writers and composers with a setting for individual creative work, reflection and innovation on a 20,000-acre working ranch in northeastern Wyoming. Some of the works supported by Ucross include: The Shipping News by Annie Proulx, Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert, The Light in the Piazza with music and lyrics by Adam Guettel, and The Grapes of Wrath composed by Ricky Ian Gordon. In the 1990s, in recognition of the strong, lasting and positive influence that teachers had on his life, Plank started a program in his hometown of Minneapolis to provide teachers opportunities for summer sabbaticals, self-designed programs of learning and exploration. He endowed the program with $1 million. That pilot program has since grown into a public foundation called Fund for Teachers. In Egypt, where Apache is a leading oil and gas producer, thousands of young girls are getting their first opportunity for formal education in 201 one-room school buildings constructed by Springboard ‚Äì Educating the Future, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization established by Plank. Plank also established the Raymond Plank Professorship of Global Energy Policy at Harvard‚Äôs John F. Kennedy School of Government. He served as chairman of the Wyoming Futures Project and co-chairman of Minnesota Wellspring, was a founding member of Freedom Lift and Friends of Mesa Verde, and a member of the Denver Art Museum board of trustees. Plank has been a trustee of Carleton College, where Apache established the Raymond Plank Chair in Incentive Economics, and is past chairman of the University of Minnesota Foundation. He also was a trustee of the Northrop Collegiate School, member of the advisory board of Augsburg College, and founder of the Plank Institute at The Blake School, all in Minneapolis. Plank was a founding member of Stakeholders in America, the American Energy Assurance Council, and Energy Security Policy.  Awards  In 2014, Plank was named the Houston Technology Center‚Äôs Entrepreneur of the Year. He also received the St. Paul Newspaper Guild‚Äôs Man of the Year; the National Royalty Owners Association Energy Leader of the Year in 1995; Minnesota Entrepreneur of the Year; Wyoming Man of the Year; and National Jewish Hospital (Minnesota) Man of the Year. Plank was selected CEO of the Year on three occasions by The Wall Street Transcript and was listed among Hart Publications‚Äô 100 Most Influential People of the Petroleum Century. In 2009 Plank received the Award of Distinction from the University of Oklahoma‚Äôs Jeannine Rainbolt College of Education.  Death  Plank died on November 8th, 2018, at the age of 96.

It was located in present-day Marquette Park in Miller Beach, near the southern tip of Lake Michigan. Indiana City was one of a handful of early contenders to be a port city on southern Lake Michigan, alongside Chicago, City West, and Michigan City. Plats for the town were drawn up in 1836 or 1837, but it was never built. Like City West to its east, the Indiana City project was doomed by the panic of 1837. The plat was not recorded until January 1838, and it is uncertain whether any plots were ever sold. Had it been built, the town would have stretched for 25 blocks, covering much of present-day Miller Beach from the lakeshore to the former Indian boundary line. The site's strategic location at the river mouth had attracted attention early on. Bennett's Tavern, which served the stagecoaches that ran along the lakeshore, had been built near the site in 1833 and remained in operation for several years thereafter. The tavern was the first regular European habitation in Lake County. Even earlier, in the 1820s, Joseph Bailly purchased 2,000 acres in the vicinity, and laid plans for a town to be called Bailly's Harbor; but like Indiana City, this never came to fruition. In subsequent years, the mouth of the Grand Calumet drifted shut, creating the Miller Lagoons, which are now the headwaters of a river that flows in the opposite direction from that of the 1830s.

It was co-produced by Irvine and Steve Cooney.Sleeve notes from Andy Irvine - Way Out Yonder, Andy Irvine AK-2, 2000. Recording This album opens with \\"Gladiators\\", a self-penned song celebrating the life of Tom Barker who was editor of the Industrial Workers of the World's newspaper, Direct Action just before, during and after the first world war. He led an effective campaign against the Australian government of William Morris Hughes' plans to introduce conscription. \\"Moreton Bay\\" is an Australian convict ballad about the brutality meted out by captain Patrick Logan, commander of Moreton Bay penal colony between 1826 and 1830. When he was killed by a party of Aboriginal hunters, the convicts rejoiced at the news of his death. \\"They'll Never Believe it's True/Froggy's Jig\\" is an amusing tale during which, late one night, Irvine chances upon a procession headed by an old and creaky piper, leading to a Faerie building site. After being invited to join the dance and perform, he receives his trademark green plectrum from the Faerie Queene herself, \\"but they'll never believe it's true\\". \\"The Girl I Left Behind\\", is a song from Sam Henry's collection. It tells the story of a young man who emigrates from Ireland to Glasgow in search of work but can't forget the sweetheart he left behind, even though he later discovers she married another. He then decides to travel farther afield and eventually finds love in New York, while never able to forget the girl who perjured her vows. \\"Way Out Yonder\\" is an instrumental Bulgarian tune Irvine received from many people who had sent him cassettes over the years. The lead melodies are performed by Nikola Parov on gadulka, Brendan Power on harmonica and Rens van der Zalm of fiddle. \\"The Highwayman\\" is Alfred Noyes's long poem set to new music by Loreena McKennitt and this is Irvine's adaptation of her song. \\"When the Boys Are on Parade\\" is a song written by Marcus Turner from Dunedin in New Zealand. It reflects on the ambivalence of antimilitarists when confronted with the horrors of war. \\"On a Distant Shore\\" is an instrumental written by Irvine, with Declan Masterson on low whistle and pipes. The album closes with \\"Born in Carrickfergus\\". It is a poignant song written by Irvine and inspired by the childhood memories of Adrian Jefferies, a Catholic who grew up in mainly Protestant East Antrim during the Troubles in the 1970s.

The party was founded in Dibrugarh by Ahom elites on May 8, 1945. It united different groups that sought to challenge the Indian National Congress (which the Ahom elites saw as a platform for caste Hindus) in elections. The All India Muslim League, the Tribal League and the Ahom Sabha took part in the founding of the party. The party sought to mobilise the Kachari, Muttock and Deuri communities, to compete against caste Hindus for political influence. To a large extent, the party represented tea garden labourers. During its initial period, the party demanded that the British colonial government should create a separate Ahom constituency (a demand that was not heeded by the government). The party cooperated with the Muslim League, being united in their opposition against the Congress party. The headquarters of the party were based in Jorhat. Surendranath Buragohain was the founding general secretary of the party. Soon, however, he left the party. Muhammed Saadulah (leader of the Muslim League) was unanimously elected chairman of Sarbadal at its founding conference. Another founding member was P.M. Sarwan. As of 1949, Ghana Kanta Gogoi was the general secretary of the party. Following the Independence of India, the party contested the 1952, 1957 and 1962 Assam legislative assembly elections. In each of these elections the party contested three seats. In the 1952 election, running as the 'All People's Party', the party won one seat (Titibar).

Penny4NASA also attempts to promote public awareness of the NASA mission and budget, and has produced a series of outreach videos, as well as performing educational outreach via social media. Overview Penny4NASA is a campaign of Space Advocates, an initiative founded by John Zeller in 2012, and proposes an increase in the budget for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to promote the scientific and technological goals of the space agency. The organization works to accomplish these aims through public outreach, educational materials, and has organized petitions to the Executive and Legislative branches of the United States government toward those aims. Penny4NASA is the campaign Space Advocates is best known for. The Penny4NASA campaign was founded in 2012 following the testimony of astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson ‚Äì curator of the Hayden Planetarium in New York ‚Äì before the United States Senate Science Committee. According to Tyson's testimony, ‚ÄúRight now, NASA‚Äôs annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that‚Äîa penny on a dollar‚Äîwe can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.‚Äù =Objectives= The Penny4NASA mission statement declares that a main goal of the campaign is to call upon the White House and U.S. Congress \\"to increase NASA's funding from its current level of 0.48% to a whole one percent of the US annual budget.\\" The organization hopes to meet this aim by encouraging to public to \\"consistently and in large numbers, [contact] members of congress to tell them what [the public] want[s].\\" Another goal of the Penny4NASA campaign, as part of its larger goal to influence the public in favor of increasing the funding allotted the U.S. space program, is to communicate accurate information about how much funding has been allotted NASA over its operational history. The mission statement states that \\"2012 is the 2nd lowest year of NASA funding by percentage of the US budget since 1958 and 1959, their founding years.\\" Neil deGrasse Tyson, a stated influence of the Penny4NASA organization, has argued that NASA is not only underfunded, but that the general public overestimates how much revenue is allocated to the space program. At a March 2010 talk delivered in the University at Buffalo's Distinguished Speaker series, Tyson stated: > \\"By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did > you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money [‚Ä¶].' I ask > them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten > cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny.\\" Tyson has proposed increasing the budget of NASA and suggested that doing so would increase the capabilities of human spaceflight, allowing the space program to \\"do it all,\\" referring to pursuing multiple avenues of exploration. =Media coverage and reception= In March 2012 Neil deGrasse Tyson was interviewed by Joshua Topolsky. Speaking of the Penny4NASA campaign and social media initiatives, Tyson said he was surprised by the online mobilization within 10 days of his Senate committee testimony, and that he was \\"happy to learn that\\" people were moved by it. On June 10, 2012 John Zeller, then an undergraduate student at Oregon State University majoring in Computer Science, was interviewed in the Science for the People podcast. Zeller started the Penny4NASA.org web site after observing Neil deGrasse Tyson giving a testimony before the U.S. Senate committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Zeller states, \\"After watching this video, I went on Twitter and Facebook and I saw hashtag Penny4NASA all over the place. There had been a video put on YouTube that had hashtag Penny4NASA all over it that was trending around 300,000 views.\\" The success of the video prompted Zeller to begin the web site and set up a petition and social media around the 'Penny4NASA' hashtag that had come to summarize the proposal of its movement. A September 2, 2012 episode of Astronomy Cast recorded at DragonCon in Atlanta, Georgia focused on funding issues related to space exploration. Discussing the Penny4NASA proposal and supportive of its goals, astronomer Pamela Gay stated that it may not be a realistic goal to \\"convince the Congress to take a penny of every tax dollar and give it to NASA,\\" but went on to say it may be possible to produce \\"the same ultimate effect by individuals who have the extra ten dollars and care about science and finding that science project that they believe in and giving it ten dollars.\\" Campaign efforts In 2012, Penny4NASA organization released a two-part video series titled \\"We Stopped Dreaming\\" to make a case for expanding the combined efforts of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, international space partnerships, private space exploration and combinations thereof. Two additional videos by Brandon Fibbs were subsequently released in 2012, \\"Dare Mighty Things: Curiosity on Mars\\" and \\"Audacious Visions.\\" A petition was created in March 2012 on behalf of Penny4NASA using the U.S. White House's We the People petitioning system. The petition argued for a reallocation of funding, stating that the investment would be smaller than recent government expenditures, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. The White House issued an official response to the initial petition, entitled Doubling and Tripling What We Can Accomplish in Space, stating \\"NASA and space are so important to our future that we do need to be doubling and tripling what we can accomplish in this domain.\\" The White House's response also emphasized fiscal challenges but argued that through effective spending to deliver results, \\"NASA is as strong as ever.\\" On August 9, 2012, Penny4NASA published a response in an open letter to White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director John Holdren, acknowledging fiscal challenges, but adding that they were \\"concerned that the message of [the] organization and the almost 30,000 individuals who have signed the petition is being overlooked.\\" As of January 2013, the petition was taken down from the We the People website for not meeting the signature threshold. Following the White House petition, the Penny4NASA organization endorsed a congressional petition using the POPVOX widget, an online tool for communicating support or dissent for particular bills on behalf of its user base to the members of the United States Congress in a public forum.

Early life Tutwiler was born on October 13, 1846 in Palmyra, Virginia to Thomas H. Tutwiler and Harriet (Strange) Tutwiler. His father was a lawyer and served as commonwealth attorney and as a member of the Virginia Legislature for Fluvanna County. A young Tutwiler as a VMI cadet. In 1864, at age 17, Edward Magruder Tutweiler interrupted his studies at the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) to serve in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He fought in the Battle of New Market, during which many VMI cadets died. He served at the front until the evacuation of Richmond. When the war ended, he resumed his collegiate studies in engineering; he graduated in 1867. Career The following two years Tutweiler earned his living as a teacher. He then began work as an engineer, taking a position as a rodman (a surveyor's assistant who holds the leveling rod) in the engineering corps of the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad. He was an indefatigable worker and made rapid advance in his profession during the next ten or twelve years. He served in various capacities, from locating engineer to chief engineer, in connection with the Chesapeake and Ohio, the Cincinnati Southern, the Miami Valley, the Richmond and Allegheny, and finally with the Georgia Pacific Railway. Tutwiler had the distinction of locating the eastern end of the Chesapeake and Ohio from Richmond to Newport News during the early 1870s. In 1879 he served one year as assistant engineer of the City of Cincinnati. It was Tutwiler's connection with the Georgia Pacific that eventually led to his moving to Alabama in 1881. Two years later he became superintendent of the Sloss Company's coal mines at Coalburg, Brookside and Blossburg. In 1889 he organized the Tutwiler Coal, Coke & Iron Company, which became an important factor in the industrial life of Birmingham. In this company, Tutwiler pioneered a more benevolent relationship between management and employees. In 1906, Tutwiler retired from the more active business pursuits of life to devote his attention to his private interests. He continued to serve in other capacities around Birmingham, however. He served on the board of director of the First National Bank, the Birmingham Underwriters, the Alabama Grocery Company, and Roberts & Son Printing Company. He also supplied much of the capital for the construction of the Tutwiler Hotel (now demolished) and the Ridgely Apartments (converted into the present-day Tutwiler Hotel) in Birmingham. He was a member of the Episcopal Church of the Advent and of various clubs and civic organizations. Personal life and death In 1876 Tutwiler married Mary F. Jeffrey, who died in 1885. He had three sons with his wife Mary: Temple W., Edward M., Jr., and Herbert. In 1887 Mr. Tutwiler married his second wife, Margaret Lee Chewning of Virginia. Tutwiler contracted pneumonia in early May 1924. Hoping that travel would help him recuperate, Tutwiler traveled with his wife to visit his son, who lived in India. Tutwiler died at sea aboard the Empress of France during the return voyage.

Descharnes (January 1, 1926 ‚Äì February 15, 2014) was a French photographer, filmmaker and author. He served as Salvador Dal√≠'s secretary and, after the painter's death, administrator of his copyright. He is the author of several books on Dal√≠. Biography Descharnes was born in Nevers on January 1, 1926. In 1950, he met Dal√≠ on a ship while he was the photographer. The two formed a close bond, and collaborated on the experimental film L'Aventure prodigieuse de la dentelli√®re et du rhinoc√©ros, which was never released. He became Dal√≠'s personal secretary in 1981, and rescued him from a fire at his apartment in 1984. Descharnes collected over 60,000 negatives of Dal√≠'s daily life, a fraction of which Descharnes infrequently exhibited in art museums. For over 40 years, he fought to protect Dal√≠'s legacy from forgeries and fakes. He wrote several reference books on the man's life and work.Carr√© d'art : Byron, Barbey d'Aurevilly, Dal√≠, Hallier, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, Anagramme Editions, 2008, p. 261. Descharnes was named a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2011. He died at the age of 88 at his home in Indre-et-Loire on February 15, 2014. Descharnes is regarded by some Dal√≠ experts as a controversial figure. His claims regarding the authenticity of some of Dal√≠'s late works have been questioned, as Ian Gibson notes in his definitive biography of the painter, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal√≠. Of far greater concern was Descharnes's role in persuading the elderly, infirm painter to transfer his copyright, in 1986, for a period of 20 years to a company managed by Descharnes. Gibson writes, \\"The contract was prepared by [the Madrid lawyer] Miguel Domenech, who has said that at the time Dal√≠, he and [Dal√≠'s friend, Antoni] Pitxot were under 'tremendous pressure' from a now power-hungry Descharnes. ... Even when he was well, Dal√≠ had never shown any interest in contracts, or any understanding of their small print. ... It is difficult to believe, therefore, that...he could have grasped its exact nature or its potential consequences. The painter, moreover, was in very poor physical condition at this time.\\"Gibson, Ian (1998) The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal√≠, pps. 669-670. Gibson, who calls Descharnes \\"a very controversial figure in Spain\\", notes in a 1997 episode of the TV show Omnibus about Dal√≠ and his work that \\"many of Dal√≠'s associates are still unhappy about this situation\\", by which he means the circumstances surrounding the signing of the contract in which Dal√≠ assigned his copyright to Descharnes's company.Omnibus, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mMz9JXbCOs.

Sandt was born in Brookville, Pennsylvania on May 19, 1888. Early in his life, he developed an interest in motorized machines, which led to his opening of a car garage named the Star Garage in Erie, Pennsylvania with his brother, Walter. While in Erie, Earl (who used his middle name) was exposed to aviation exhibitions and had the opportunity to meet Lincoln Beachy, renowned pioneer aviator. With advice from Beachy and others, he decided to learn to fly and attended the Curtiss Flight School in Hammondsport, New York. Earl's career was highlighted by several flight records and a number of accidents. In Erie, Pennsylvania, He had his first accident in his new Curtiss aeroplane on the first day that he experimented with it. Without intending to fly, he lifted from the ground and crash landed, but avoided personal injury. On January 28, 1912, Sandt set an altitude record for Erie of 900 feet. Later, he bested his own record by reaching an altitude of 7,800 feet. His most notable flight was his 34-minute flight across a frozen Lake Erie on February 15, 1912, to Long Point Peninsula near Port Rowan, Canada. Hailed as the first flight across inland seas in America and the first international flight from North America, this flight ended almost in tragedy, as Earl crash landed into the frozen Lake Erie on his return trip. He survived the crash and despite a number of injuries to his eye and body, hiked his way back to shore over and around ice hammocks and thin ice. Despite Sandt's offer of a $300.00 award for the retrieval of his aeroplane, search parties failed to find any remnants of the aeroplane. With the help of Erie newspapers and friends, Sandt managed to acquire a new Curtiss Aeroplane in May 1912. On his first public flight, he flew from Walnut Creek, where he was testing his machine, to Waldameer Park and crashed into a pole rather than hit spectators. Earl's aeroplane was repaired and he resumed flying at his first exhibition outside of Erie in DuBois, Pennsylvania, reaching an altitude of 1800 feet. Sandt's next flight was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where numerous aviators had limited success in previous exhibitions. On June 15, 1912, after taking off from Schenely Park in Oakland, Sandt had a successful flight in Pittsburgh lasting 21 minutes in view of thousands of spectators, many watching from rooftops, over the main parts of the city. After a couple of successful flights at Conneaut Exposition Park, Earl returned to his hometown of Brookville, Pennsylvania. Another mishap occurred when he attempted a flight with his cousin on board. Both survived with slight injuries. Later, Sandt, by himself, flew in what was reported as the first cross country flight in Western Pennsylvania from Brookville, Pennsylvania to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, a distance of 22 miles. Returning to Conneaut Exposition Park, Sandt had several more fine exhibition flights until a bad crash resulted in several severe contusions and a concussion. After weeks of convalescing, Earl resumed flying at Fort Recovery, Ohio. Completing the engagement for another pilot, George Schmidt, Earl made the first air mail delivery for the state of Ohio. He then continued with flight exhibitions in Chrisney, Indiana, and Cortland New York. At Cortland, he was presented with a \\"Loving Cup\\" to award him for his aviation achievements. While in New York and flying from Moravia, he was shot at by a confused farmer. On September 2, 1912, Sandt returned to Pittsburgh, where he flew three days in exhibitions at Brunot's Island. He would finish the exhibition as the only successful flyer. His next flights took him to a number of small towns, Uricheville Ohio, Ripley West Virginia, and Clarion County. At Ripley, he ran his aeroplane into a wire fence, but escaped injury. While being filmed by the Columbia Educational Film Company he crashed into a barb wire fence while flying at an exhibition in Lorain, Ohio, October 6, 1912. Unhurt by his accident, Earl completed engagements at Greenville, Meadville, and Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. In the winter of 1913, Sandt embarked on a series of flights in Erie, Pennsylvania with passengers, including Nellie Seidel, 16 years old, who became the first female to fly in an aeroplane in Erie, Pennsylvania. In the spring of 1913, Earl made experimental trips at Lake Erie to test the hydroaeroplane built by Henry Seidel. This hydroaeroplane was the result of a collaboration between Earl, Seidel, and Earl's brother, Walter. Canceling the testing of the Hydroaeroplane in public during the Memorial Day weekend in 1913, Sandt instead flew in Belleville, Ontario for the King George V birthday celebration and fair, where he became the first to fly over the Bay of Quinte. Sandt's last flight was in Grove City, Pennsylvania. After two trouble free flights, he was having another successful flight before hitting a downdraft which caused the aeroplane to drop suddenly and smash into a garage before landing on freshly cultivated ground. Earl sustained serious injuries, including a compound fracture to his left leg and a fracture to his left arm, as well as many contusions. Despite making good progress in healing from his injuries, Earl developed lock jaw, better known as tetanus. His brother Walter enlisted a special train to bring anti-toxin to Grove City. The anti-toxin brought improvement to Earl at first, but on June 22, 1913, Sandt's symptoms became grave and he died on June 22, 1913, and was buried in Brookville Pennsylvania. In 1930, Mrs. Lindbergh, mother of Charles Lindbergh, who made the first solo flight across the Atlantic, stopped while in Brookville, Pennsylvania to pay tribute to Lewis Earle Sandt for his contributions to the development of early aviation. Other commendations included a \\"commemorative air mail envelope\\" designed for the first airmail service from Brookville to Pittsburgh. \\"In 1957, State Representative Ralph A. Marsh introduced a resolution to the Pennsylvania Assembly, paying tribute to Earle Sandt. It was done on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Charles Lindberg(h)'s flight from New York to Paris, and the 30th anniversary of the United States Air Force. On June 17, 1962, a special DuBois-to-Pittsburgh flight was named after Earle Sandt. Plaques were set up in memory of him at the Greater Pittsburgh International Airport and at the Dubois-Jefferson County Airport\\"  References  Category:1888 births Category:1913 deaths Category:Aviators from Pennsylvania Category:Aviators killed in aviation accidents or incidents in the United States Category:People from Brookville, Pennsylvania Category:American aviation record holders ","title":"Lewis Earle Sandt"},{"id":"42134081","text":"Manoba briggsi is a moth in the family Nolidae.

This merger created a trackage map that looked like an upside-down T, with the horizontal bar of the T being a main line from Princeton (a junction with the Chicago and North Western near Gwinn) on the west to Munising on the east, and the upright bar of the T being a main line from Lawson, on the east‚Äìwest main line, to Big Bay in the north. This Lawson‚ÄìBig Bay line also served Marquette, the central Upper Peninsula's largest city. The main lines, together, accounted for of track, with an additional of spur lines extending into various groves of harvestable timber. As timber dwindled and was replaced by less profitable pulpwood, Cleveland- Cliffs interests consolidated the MM&SE; into another line they controlled, the Marquette-based Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad (LS&I;); the 1923 merger ended the MM&SE;'s existence. The LS&I; abandoned the MM&SE;'s former trackage in the second half of the 20th century. All but a short spur of the last segment, the former main line to Munising, ceased operations in 1979.

She is considered one of the Tachtigers and acquired a reputation as a sonneteer. Biography Stephanie H√©l√®ne Swarth (when she was married, Lapidoth-Swarth) was born in Amsterdam, 25 October 1859. Her father was a merchant, Eduard Swarth, who for a while was the consul for Portugal in Amsterdam, and her mother was Maria Jacoba Heijblom. She grew up in Brussels, where her father was a banker, and lived in Mechelen until her marriage to Dutch author Frits Lapidoth, which lasted from 1894 to 1910. This unhappy marriage is the subject of a monograph by Jeroen Brouwers, H√©l√®ne Swarth. Haar huwelijk met Frits Lapidoth, 1894-1910 (1986). Her poetic debut was a collection of poems in French influenced by Alphonse de Lamartine, but she switched to Dutch-language poems on the advice of Pol De Mont. An early admirer was poet Willem Kloos who called her \\"the singing heart of Holland\\" and published her poems in his magazine De Nieuwe Gids. She died in Velp on 20 June 1941. Poetry Engraving by E. A. Tilly, 1898 After two collections in French, Swarth published a Dutch volume of songs and sonnets, Eenzame bloemen (\\"Lonely flowers\\", 1883). A reviewer in De Gids thought the songs frequently too sentimental (and in the vein of Heinrich Heine), but appreciated the sonnets. Conrad Busken Huet saw in her second Dutch collection, Blue Flowers (\\"Blue Flowers\\", 1884), a poetry receptive to nature and a female spirit which would make whichever man she chose as a lover very happy; a reviewer for De Gids saw worthwhile thoughts and images in only a few of the sonnets. Lodewijk van Deyssel likewise criticized the volume's songs and praised the sonnets‚Äîeven to the point of prophesying that her name would be blessed. By the time Sneeuwvlokken (\\"Snow flakes\\", 1888) was published, she had gained a reputation for a poetry of love and suffering. By this time she had moved to Mechelen. A review in De Gids compared her work favorably to \\"sweet, homely poetry\\", which he likened to a sweet little tune on a fiddle, whereas Swarth's \\"deep, full poetry\\" was like hearing Beethoven played by a full orchestra. Again, especially her sonnets were praised. An overview article in Vlaamsche School (1889) pointed at the influence of Pol de Mont, who had advised her to forgo reading narrative and epic, and instead focus on lyrical poetry, sonnets. The origin of the sadness in her poetry was located in a \\"loss of faith and bitter disappointments\\". At least one critic gave her entire oeuvre (including the anthologized \\"Jeux Innocents\\") an autobiographical reading: Swarth supposedly gave her heart to a young poet but he was unfaithful to her. According to Jacob Ek Jzn, this particular cause of sorrow speaks in all her work, without becoming a distraction or a bore since she found many different ways and forms of expressing both the initial sentiment and its recollection. Swarth and her poetry figure in Ina Boudier- Bakker's best-known novel, De klop op de deur, as a female poet unafraid to express her suffering for love. A key line from \\"Jeux Innocents\\" was cited in 1954 by then-foreign minister Johan Willem Beyen during a discussion on European unification: \\"Wij speelden pandje met ons leven\\" (\\"we bargained with our lives\\") was used to emphasize that all countries, even small ones, had much at stake in the era of globalization.

Plot Illustration: \\"Come, Father! Won't You Come Home?\\" from an 1882 edition of Ten Nights in a Bar-room The novel is presented by an unnamed narrator who makes an annual visit to the fictional town of Cedarville. On his first visit, he stops at the new tavern, the Sickle and Sheaf. The proprietor, Simon Slade, is a former miller who gave up the trade for the more lucrative tavern. The business is a family affair, with Slade's wife Ann, son Frank, and daughter Flora assisting him. The narrator also observes the town drunk, Joe Morgan. The father of a loving wife and family, he meets his moral downfall when introduced to alcohol. Morgan quickly becomes an alcoholic and spends most of his time at a bar. One day, his daughter begs him to return to his family. He initially ignores her desires until she is hit in the head by a flying glass as she goes to retrieve her father. Slade had initially thrown the tumbler at Morgan so, to a degree, her death is on his hands. On her deathbed, the daughter begs Morgan to abandon alcohol, to which he agrees. The novel progresses through the ruinous fall of more characters all at the hands of hard drink and other vices (gambling becomes another major reform notion in the text). Shay spends some time discussing corruption in politics with the corrupt \\"rum party\\" candidate from Cedarville, Judge Lyman. The narrator continually notes how even the drinkers in the story call for \\"the Maine Law\\" which will prohibit alcohol from being so temptingly available. The novel closes with the death of Simon Slade, already mutilated from an earlier riotous sequence of murders and mob mentality, at the hands of his son. The two had gotten into a drunken argument and Frank strikes his father in the head with a bottle. In the final scene the narrator sees the post with the once pristine and now gross and rotten Sickle and Sheaf totem chopped down after the town's moral fiber finally showed itself in a series of resolutions that led to the destruction of all the alcohol on the premises. Analysis In addition to its advocacy of temperance, the book is also significant because of its promotion of the Cult of Domesticity and prohibition. Arthur used the book to argue that women needed to steer men to the path of morality to protect the home. Nothing was as dangerous to morality as alcohol, so its use needed to be restricted by women. The book is the first work to openly call for prohibition and was a popular temperance melodrama. Response Ten Nights in a Bar-room was a financial success for Arthur and became the second most popular book of the Victorian Era, following Uncle Tom's Cabin. The novel was easily transferred to play format, so it was frequently used to promote prohibition to large audiences. The play based on the novel continued to be popular even after the end of prohibition in the United States, although it was usually presented as a parody. Its first adaptation was for the Broadway stage by William W. Pratt in 1858 as Ten Nights in a Barroom. Among its film adaptations was a 1910 silent film starring Frank H. Crane and Marie Eline (now lost), a 1913 adaptation by Lee Beggs with a cast including Gladys Egan, a 1921 film directed by Oscar Apfel, and a 1931 film starring William Farnum as Joe Morgan and Tom Santschi as Simon Slade.

The group's demands include compensation, an apology and an assurance that it will never happen again. Whilst trillions of pounds in profit from the trade went towards building countries such as Britain, the claim from those willing to sue was that the Caribbean was left poor, illiterate and suffering in extreme poor health. Rageh Omaar journeys to Jamaica to examine what lies behind those claims and he talks to those who are willing to go all the way to the international court in The Hague for justice. *John Ray ‚Äì Hart Island There is an island in New York that many locals don't even know about. For more than a century, inmates from a nearby prison have been burying the homeless, stillborn babies and unclaimed bodies there. As many as a million lost souls are to be found on Hart Island. It has been described as secret, closed and restrictive. Until now, relatives have been confined to paying their respects at a gazebo at the edge of the shoreline.

Gubarev had earlier declared himself leader of the Donbass People's Militia. But since then he has been sidelined by other separatist leaders and was banned from taking part in the 2014 Donbass parliamentary elections. These elections also eliminated the post of \\"People's Governor\\". Gubarev was not a major figure in local politics prior to the beginning of the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine. Shortly after declaring himself \\"People's Governor\\" on March 6, Gubarev was arrested by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) for \\"advocating separatism\\" and \\"illegal seizure of power\\". He faced up to ten years in prison. On 7 May, Gubarev was freed in exchange for SBU officers detained earlier by the Donbass People's Militia. Early life Gubarev gained a degree in history from the Donetsk National University, and later became an employee of a Donetsk advertising agency. In 2007 he founded and served as the company director of the \\"Morozko\\" company, which supplied hired Ded Moroz (Santa Claus) figures in the Donetsk area. Career Gubarev was a member of the Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine, a pro-Russian party based in the southeast of the country. According to an unnamed acquaintance, Gubarev advocates Pan-Slavism. In earlier years Gubarev was a member of the neo-Nazi Russian National Unity paramilitary group. Gubarev has publicly given thanks to this group for providing him with military training. In the same interview he said he was not a radical nationalist and described himself as \\"centre-left\\". On 1 March 2014, pro- Russian citizens at a meeting in Lenin Square in the center of Donetsk elected Gubarev as governor of the region. From the beginning of the 2014 Crimean crisis, Gubarev led pro-Russian protesters who blockaded and occupied the Donetsk Regional State Administration building. During a press-conference with journalists on 6 March 2014, Gubarev stated that his main goal as the self- proclaimed governor was to declare a referendum on the territorial status of Donetsk Oblast, non-recognition of the new Ukrainian government, and non- recognition of Donetsk governor Serhiy Taruta. On 6 March 2014 the Security Service of Ukraine arrested Gubarev. Following his arrest, Gubarev was reportedly taken to Kyiv for detention. He was later charged with wanting to damage \\"the territorial integrity and independence of the state\\". On 16 March, a crowd of protesters stormed government buildings in Donetsk demanding Gubarev's release. On 7 May 2014 Gubarev and two other pro-Russian activists were freed in exchange for SBU officers, detained earlier by the Donbass People's Militia. In October 2014, during a failed assassination attempt on him, Gubarev lost control of his car when it came under gunfire and suffered a head injury. He later regained consciousness and was moved from intensive care to the ordinary ward of the hospital. Gubarev was excluded by the election commission from participating in the 2014 Donbass parliamentary elections \\"because his party was not able to hold a founding conference\\". Early February 2016 Gubarev was appointed Yasynuvata Raion mayor by the Donetsk People's Republic. Following the death of Alexander Zakharchenko, there will be so-called \\"elections\\" in the Donetsk People's Republic on 11 November 2018. In September 2018, Pavel Gubarev went to Moscow and obtained permission to be a candidate for the post of head of the Donetsk People's Republic. Gubarev and supporters collected 15,000 signatures for his nomination papers (the law only requires 10,000 signatures). Gubarev's candidacy displeased Denis Pushilin, who has taken over as head of the Donetsk People's Republic, and pressure has been put on Gubarev. On 29 September 2018, Gubarev's wife, Ekaterina, was arrested and temporarily detained to prevent her attending the Free Donbass party convention so that she was excluded from the party list for the \\"elections\\" of the People's Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic on 11 November. At the convention, the Free Donbass movement was taken over by supporters of Denis Pushilin. After this incident Ekaterina Gubareva left for Rostov-on-Don. In early October 2018, the electoral commission ruled that the signatures on Gubarev's nomination papers were invalid; the authorities in Russia often use this method to exclude candidates.

The DVD contains an interview with Tsui Hark and the film's trailer. Reception Time Out London stated that \\"Some of the acrobatic fights do seem grimly anarchic, but the endless booby traps grow tiresome and the film's 'dark side' is undercut by feeble elements of humour and romance. As a genre piece: too little, too late.\\" Film 4 opined that \\"Lam gives the story a new twist by envisaging the temple as a kind of Quake-type fortress complete with bottomless pits, traps, poison gases and other nasties that await the two fighters who are assigned to free the monks. Some amazing cinematography and art direction lift this endeavour out of the ordinary.\\" The Austin Chronicle praised the film, stating that it is \\"Lam's bizarre direction that makes this one of the better chopsocky efforts in recent memory. He manages to make the genre's clich√©s seem brand new again, creating a considerably darker and more sinister piece than your typical martial arts picture\\" and that \\"Although the finale is a slight letdown, for the most part, Burning Paradise is a terrific movie that tells an old story with a new attitude.\\" Variety referred to the film as \\"the highly entertaining but uncharacteristic swordplay item\\" in a review of Lam's later feature The Adventurers.

It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on March 9, 2014. The episode was written by Dan Greaney and Allen Glazier and directed by Michael Polcino. In the episode, Bart makes friends with a transfer student named Diggs, an expert in falconry who saves Bart from the wrath of the Springfield Elementary bullies ‚Äì and who intends to take to the sky himself, which makes Bart worry about Diggs' sanity. Plot When a visiting and newly converted Christian minister from Indonesia pleads with Springfield churchgoers for a donation to help sick children, Bart sympathizes with a boy his own age. Bart has a difficult time asking his parents for a donation, but Homer eventually relents, lending Bart $20. However, Homer almost instantly starts to pester Bart for repayment. Feeling the pressure of Homer's badgering, Bart confides in Milhouse at the playground before a costumed devil makes Bart an offer: if he eats anything for the money, he will be able to get the $20. Bart asks his classmates to help him out of his bind, offering to eat anything except money. Soon enough, Bart receives offers to eat used chewing gum, orthodontic wax, cinnamon, St. John's wort, and a preserved frog prepared for dissection, even though Lisa warns her brother to not consume the animal. After eating the frog Bart ends up in the hospital. Bart pays his father back the $20 (which Homer had forgotten about), but the hospital bill is $4,000. The next day Bart's friends and schoolmates, including Milhouse, shun him for eating the frog. Just when the school bullies are about to attack Bart, a new transfer student named Diggs saves the day with his falcon, Freedom. He reveals to Bart the hidden Falconry Club headquarters behind the school. As Bart spends more and more time with Diggs, he learns about falconry and conducts some mischief around town by teaching Freedom to snatch Springfielders' belongings. One day, Diggs dives from a high tree branch, resulting in his injury and emergency hospitalization. Bart questions what prompted his new friend to act as he did. Diggs explains he wanted to fly, alarming Bart with his idea that maybe all people can fly and don't know this because they don't try it anymore. Bart is told to leave the room by Dr. Hibbert and an unidentified doctor and overhears that Diggs will transfer over to a mental hospital. Homer and Marge recognize what this means, and Marge clues in Bart that this means Diggs has serious problems and that the mental hospital is \\"not the kind of a place a little boy should ever visit.\\" Homer suggests that Bart merely resume his friendship with Milhouse. Lisa is very sympathetic to Bart and he is appreciative of the comfort. Bart goes back to school and leaves the bullies stunned and silent when he responds to their taunting by angrily saying how much it sucks that his friend is mentally ill. When Bart enters the falconry club, Diggs is there climbing through a window, claiming to have gotten a day pass to participate in a falconry contest. At the contest, Diggs unveils to Bart a plan to free all the falcons. Bart helps Diggs enact the plan, and the falcons fly away in a flock. Diggs thanks Bart for his friendship and rides his bike back to the mental hospital, noting he's unlikely to get any freedom for a long time but glad they had the time together they did. Immediately afterwards, Milhouse arrives to apologize to Bart for avoiding him earlier and the two reconcile. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+, saying \\"It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs Bart, and Bart doesn‚Äôt fit these sorts of stories as well as, say, Lisa does‚Äîhis character‚Äôs just not built for 'affecting,' at least not any more. There‚Äôs no connection made between his initial generosity toward the kid in the church story and his willingness to remain loyal to his new friend. And so 'Diggs' fades in the memory. You know, just as Diggs himself will once Bart breaks out the slingshot again next week.\\". The episode received a 1.2 rating and was watched by a total of 2.69 million people. It was the third most watched show on Animation Domination.

She was the great-great grandmother of state senator James A. Clark Jr. (1918-2006). She was inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame in 1988. He was married to Nathan Tyson, a merchant and the son of emancipator and abolitionist Elisha Tyson. Early life and education Tyson was born September 13, 1795 to George Ellicott and Elizabeth (Brooke) Ellicott, a well respected family of Maryland Quakers, the Ellicotts. The family homestead was a stone house built in 1789 near the Patapsco River and the family's mill. Her father often welcomed Native Americans to their home. One of seven children, she was born and raised in Ellicott's Mills (now Ellicott City, Maryland), founded by her grandfather, Andrew Ellicott and his brothers. She accounted in her books visiting with chief Little Turtle in 1807 at Christmas when she was the age of twelve. Although she never completed formal schooling past primary education, she was well educated at home and fluent in French. Marriage and children In 1815, she married Nathan Tyson the son of Elisha Tyson, a Quaker and abolitionist of Baltimore, was the Baltimore Chamber of Commerce's first president. He was also the first president of the Baltimore Corn and Flour Exchange. He had a \\"gracious love story\\" with his wife and they had a relaxed attitude about some Quaker conventions. Tyson was described as a \\"woman of much sweetness and dignity of bearing, possessed of an exceedingly cultivated mind and many accomplishments.\\" They had twelve children, ten of them to adulthood. Eight of their children made it to middle-age. Their children included James Tyson (died by or in early 1905), Elizabeth Brooke Tyson Smith, Henry Tyson, Isabella (died by 1905), Frederic Tyson, Robert Tyson, and Lucy Tyson Fitzhugh. Tyson ensured that both her sons and daughters received a good education. Nathan died on January 6, 1867, and his funeral was held January 9, 1867. Leaders of the Baltimore Corn and Flour Exchange said of him, \\"the deceased presented to us, in his daily conduct, his known integrity, his uniform courtesy and goodness of heart\\". Quaker abolitionist and educator She was a member of the Little Falls Meetinghouse in Harford County. At the age of 35, Tyson was chosen as an Elder of the Baltimore Quaker Meeting. When she was 66, she was appointed as a minister, although she had been working in that capacity informally for years. Tyson worked to improve educational opportunities for enslaved people and women and, with her husband, helped found the Fallston Public Library. At her suggestion, a committee on education was established at the Baltimore Yearly Meeting to prepare teachers and to focus on higher education of Quaker children. She was an abolitionist. Swarthmore College A strong supporter of Quaker and coeducation, Tyson was a key founder, along with Lucretia Mott, Edward Parrish, and Benjamin Hallowell, of Swarthmore College. She had tried unsuccessfully for ten years to found a college. Tyson and her husband tried a new approach when they hosted a meeting in their home of Quaker leaders from New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. This meeting of 30 leaders propelled the movement to start the second coeducation college in the United States, providing new educational opportunities for women. Founded in 1860, just prior to the American Civil War, Swarthmore College was established to provide: \\"A better educated generation that could achieve freedom, peace, prosperity, and righteousness.\\" The college opened in 1869. She began recruiting for women professors with the president of Vassar College in 1863, and she was on Swarthmore's Board of Managers. Author and editor Martha Tyson is also well known for her biographical accounts of the scientist, surveyor, and author Benjamin Banneker. As a free African-American, Banneker was a frequent visitor at Tyson's childhood home, sharing a mutual enthusiasm for learning with the family. Banneker, who lived about one mile from the Ellicotts, was mentored by Martha's father. It was rare for a woman to write a biography, and especially rare for a white woman to write a biography of a former slave. Tyson was eleven years old when Banneker died. She conducted interviews and compiled the material for two biographies, the second of which was edited by her daughter Anne Tyson Kirk, who sought advice from Frederick Douglass. The two biographies of Banneker are, Sketch in the Life of Benjamin Banneker, published in 1854, and the more complete biography, Benjamin Banneker: The African-American Astronomer, published posthumously in 1884. She also wrote A Brief Account of the Settlement of Ellicott's Mills and was a co-author, with Charles Worthington Evans and G. Hunter Bartlett, of American Family History: Fox, Ellicott, Evans. She also wrote memoirs of family members, like Joseph Ellicott, which was published by the Maryland Historical Society. Her father and Gerald T. Hopkins went to Fort Wayne, then part of the Northwest Territory, to meet with Native Americans. They were directed by the Baltimore Yearly Meeting of Friends. Hopkins kept a journal of the details of the trip, which she edited in 1862. She also wrote about the meetings that her father had with the United States government regarding the Native Americans. Death and legacy After having been ill for three months, Martha Ellicott Tyson died on March 5, 1873 at her home at 299 Madison Street in Baltimore. She was buried at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore. A poem was written about her and her portrait at Swarthmore College by John Russell Hayes entitled \\"A Portrait of Martha Ellicott Tyson\\". She was inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame in 1988.

The building was formerly one of the oldest in Howard County until its relocation in 1963 to Phoenix, Maryland in Baltimore County. Partnership is a three-bay wide brick construction house with a gambrel roof. The bricks were created on-site, some with animal footprints imbedded. In 1719, the land named Partnership was patented by Thomas Worthington (c. 1890‚Äì1753). A brick home was constructed on-site at what was a slave tobacco plantation. Worthington's daughter Katherine (1720‚Äì1788) took the property as part of a dowry to her marriage with Captain Nicholas Gassaway. Captain Gassaway (c. 1719‚Äì1755) resided on the property and estate in 1775 when he willed it to his son Brice John Gassaway (1755‚Äì1806). The house was bought by James Cox, then sold to Hamilton Moore in 1851. The house is best known as the Moore house, with Moore's granddaughter, Mrs. George Skaggs, owning it until 1960.

When it was first founded, its members were exclusively Chinese, many of whom served as compradors in Western mercantile firms. History The Chinese Club was established in 1897 by Tse Tsan-tai (Ë¨ùÁ∫òÊ≥∞ or Ë¨ùË¥äÊ≥∞), an Australian-born social and political reformer, merchandiser and reporter, whose stated vow was to overthrow the Qing dynasty by force. At the time of its founding, Chinese (or part Chinese) men were barred from joining the prestigious, whites-only Hong Kong Club, irrespective of their social or business standing in the community. Tse, together with Cheung Tsoi, Luk King-fo and Leung Lan-fan, decided to found a parallel club for Chinese to meet and socialise, and to raise funds from wealthy local businessmen for the revolutionary cause. At the time, Tse knew many local business leaders who were sympathetic to the cause, such as Robert Ho Tung. Ho Tung became the club's first chairman, the effect of which was to project a softer, less revolutionary image in the minds of the Hong Kong Police, thereby reducing the likelihood of a raid by authorities.http://chineseclub.hk/web/100_years.pdf Originally located on Wyndham Street, the club moved to Queen's Road. From the 1920s until 1964, it was housed on the top floor of the Bank of Canton Building at 6 Des Voeux Road Central (opposite Prince's Building). The Club moved into its own premises in 1967. Membership Originally, the membership was open to \\"any Chinese man\\" (this included Eurasians). Membership is now open to \\"all persons of Chinese origin\\". The Chinese Club Building The Clubhouse building at 21‚Äì22 Connaught Road Central opened on 1 February 1967. The Club created a building fund in 1927. Two adjacent three-storey buildings were purchased on 30 November 1940. One building was sold during the Japanese occupation to pay off outstanding debts. In the 1960s, construction of a neighbouring building compromised the pilings underneath the Club's building, forcing the Government to declare it as condemned. The Club then built a new 17-storey Clubhouse and sold the basement and first three floors of the building to pay off the construction mortgages. The Club currently owns 12 floors of the Chinese Club Building. The 8th to the 15th floors house the Club's facilities.

The author is Daniel Masterson, while Sayaka Funada-Classen gave research assistance related to the Japanese language. The book discusses all of the major Japanese populations in Latin America and some other groups of Japanese diaspora who are not as well known. The Japanese populations of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay in South America, Cuba and the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico are all discussed in this book. Most of the book is devoted to the histories of these groups, and it also has information on the current states of these communities as of 2004. The book uses primary sources, oral histories, and secondary sources.: \\"Indeed, Roger Daniels, editor of \\"The Asian American Experience\\" series of which this book is part, is to be commended for expanding the definition of \\"American\\" outside of the borders of the United States\\" In addition, Masterson included his own archival research and his own interviews. Most of his archives came from the United States while some came from Mexico and Peru. The book uses sources written in English, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish. This book is a part of \\"The Asian American Experience\\" series edited by Roger Daniels. Takeyuki (Gaku) Tsuda of the University of California, San Diego, who reviewed the book, described it in 2004 as \\"the most comprehensive overview of the Japanese diaspora in Latin America to date.\\" Ayumi Takenaka of Bryn Mawr College, who also reviewed the book, wrote that \\"This book is the first attempt to cover Japanese immigration to different Latin American countries\\". Jeffrey Lesser from Emory University, a reviewer of this book, wrote that the book is useful both for Caribbean and Latin American scholars and for scholars of ethnic studies of the United States. Lesser stated that the book is useful for the former because Latin American and Caribbean scholars \\"have traditionally treated race and ethnicity as a simple matter of black and white\\" while for the latter, The Japanese in Latin America has \\"its careful exploration of why diasporic experiences are not limited to the United States\\". Overview The Japanese in Latin America has chronological narration, with sections devoted to certain time periods: the early 20th Century, World War II to 1949, and 1950 onwards. The book also uses geographical narration, or dividing the narrations by country. Stephanie C. Moore of the University of California, San Diego, another reviewer, stated that the book \\"is more a historical survey than a comparative analysis\\" and therefore the book \\"is able to explore a wide range of topics\\". Takenaka stated that the book is \\"largely descriptive\\" and has \\"little analysis of how it happened and why.\\" Moore stated that because \\"of the uneven nature of the literature upon which he relies\\" the depth of the coverage of the topics in each country differs. The book discusses how Japanese people immigrated to Latin America and how they adapted to living in their new countries. The book chronicles the lives of their descendants. The book has an account of Nikkei people who, since the late 1980s, had moved to Japan to take manual jobs that pay more money than jobs they could find in their home countries. Takenaka stated that the work has \\"Throughout the book, there is more detailed information on Peru than on any other country\\". Lesser stated that because of the research interests of the author, Masterson, \\"it is not surprising\\" that there is so much focus on Peru. Lesser argues that the decision to focus on Peru was a \\"smart choice\\" partly because \\"work on Japanese-Peruvians is much more modest than on Brazil\\". =Contents= The book has a total of nine chapters. The first chapter is about early Japanese immigration to the United States, Canada, and Hawaii. The second chapter discusses Japanese society in the 1800s, including the Meiji Era, and beyond up until the signing of the 1908 gentleman's agreement between the United States and Japan, which restricted Japanese immigration. With the United States out of reach, Japanese immigrants began immigrating to Latin America, and the second chapter also discusses the first wave of Japanese immigration to Latin America. The third chapter discusses the Latin American communities formed between 1908 and 1937 that were among the larger ones in Latin America. The focus is given on those in Brazil, Mexico, and Peru. Those in Brazil, Mexico, and Peru discussed in this chapter belonged to the first and second generations. Chapter four discusses the Japanese communities formed between 1908 and 1938 in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, and Paraguay in South America, as well as Cuba and Central America. Those communities were among the smaller ones in Latin America. The fifth chapter discusses the impact of World War II on the Japanese communities of Latin America, covering the years 1938 to 1952. The sixth chapter discusses specifically the Japanese Peruvians during the World War II period. This is the sole single country-specific chapter. Chapter 6 has a focus on Japanese Peruvians deported from Peru and forced to be imprisoned in U.S. internment camps. The sources used in this chapter were archives and oral histories. Takenaka stated that this was \\"it is unclear if and to what extent an extensive field research was conducted, especially since there is no detailed description of authors‚Äô methods.\\" The United States government never made reparation payments to or an official apology for the ethnic Japanese Peruvians living in the United States, and that is the other reason why Lesser believed the focus on Peru was a \\"smart choice\\". Takenaka described the subject matter as \\"a largely unknown story\\". Lesser stated that Asian American studies and ethnic studies courses would find the discussion of legal proceedings related to Japanese-Peruvians who were interned \\"particularly useful\\". The post-World War II Japanese populations are the subject of the final three chapters. The seventh chapter discusses existing Japanese communities and new Japanese settlements in South America between 1952 and 1970. The chapter includes information on post-World War II Japanese settlement in Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. The immigrants, mostly from Okinawa, settled agricultural settlements, or colonias. The chapter also includes information on return migration. The eighth chapter discusses second and third-generation Japanese, called nikkei- jin, in Brazil, Mexico, and Peru. It also discusses those who went to Japan for economic reasons. Chapter 9 discusses the present-day Japanese communities in Latin America. Tsuda stated that the chapter on contemporary Japanese communities in Latin America \\"is mainly filled with factual and census survey data.\\" In the final chapter, over half of the pages discuss Japanese Peruvians. Reception Lesser stated that the book has \\"quality\\" in \\"providing a strong sense of the diversity of the Japanese and Nikkei experiences throughout Latin America\\" and that two \\"small issues\\", the use of terms such as \\"homeland\\" in a manner that may be \\"imprecise\\" to specialists of diaspora studies and ethnic history, and the possibility that specialists in specific national histories of Latin American countries \\"will quibble with some of the specifics in each of the chapters\\", \\"do not take away from the quality\\".: \\"Like all books that seek to provide an overview, specialists in the national histories of the different Latin American republics will quibble with some of the specifics in each of the chapters. In addition, specialists in ethnic history or diaspora studies may find the use of terms like \\"homeland\\" imprecise at times. But these small issues do not take away from the quality of the book in providing a strong sense of the diversity of the Japanese and Nikkei experiences throughout Latin America\\" Takenaka argued that the book \\"lacks a sharp focus\\", that it should have more extensively used the field data, and that \\"the book would have been strengthened by focusing on a number of issues addressed sporadically throughout the book.\\" However she stated that the author did a \\"good job in synthesizing the vast amount of multilingual sources\\" since it is \\"a challenging task to systematically analyze immigration to multiple countries\\", and that the book \\"successfully provides a general account of its topic\\". She wrote that \\"In particular, the book‚Äôs wide geographic and historical coverage and extensive use of sources make it a useful tool for beginning researchers.\\" Tsuda wrote that the book \\"very impressive in geographical and historical scope but remains somewhat lacking in penetrating comparative analysis and explanation.\\" Moore stated that \\"reading is at points choppy as Masterson hurls the reader back and forth through time and across the globe\\" and that \\"Masterson does not arrive at any revelatory new conclusions\\", the book is \\"thought-provoking for the specialist and generalist alike\\" and that the \\"thoroughness\\" of the book \\"is waiting to encourage cross-country analyses in the study of Asian Americans that will add depth and nuance to forthcoming scholarship.\\" Michelle J. Moran-Taylor of the University of Denver stated that despite \\"minor drawback\\"[s], \\"on the whole, the authors' exploration of the similarities and differences among the larger and smaller Japanese communities in Latin America and across time provides a thorough understanding of this particular immigrant experience.\\" Rosana Barbosa of Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia stated that \\"the book is a relevant contribution to the study of immigration to Latin America, and of the Japanese's cultural, economic, and political contributions on several Latin American countries.\\" Carl Mosk of the University of Victoria stated that \\"there is no doubt that all future students of Japanese migration will want to read this volume, drawing upon its colourful vignettes and its elaborately woven account of how international diplomacy and warfare refashioned the aspirations of Japan‚Äôs prewar emigrants.\\" Evelyn Hu-DeHart of the Pacific Historical Review wrote that the book \\"reads nicely as a historical narrative\\", and that it was \\"a thorough overview and highly readable narrative history\\". She argued that \\"the absence of a good bibliography\\" which lists published primary and secondary sources alphabetically and detailing unpublished primary sources, including archival resources, is the \\"most frustrating\\" detail., In addition, she believes that there are many terminologies from other languages in the text so that the glossary \\"could also be more comprehensive\\". Also Hu-Dehart argued that the index does not have countries that the work does not focus on and therefore is not complete.

A. donisthorpei was one of two Aphaenogaster species described in the 1930 paper. History and classification Aphaenogaster donisthorpei is known from a solitary fossil insect which is a compression-impression fossil preserved in fine shales of the Florissant formation in Colorado. The formation is composed of successive lake deposits which have preserved a diverse assemblage of insects. The insects and plants suggest a climate similar to modern Southeastern North America, with a number of taxa represented that are now found in the subtropics to tropics and confined to the old world. When A. donisthorpei was described, the Florissant formation was considered to be Miocene in age, based on the flora and fauna preserved. Subsequent research and fossil descriptions re-examined the dating, and by 1985 the formation had been reassigned to an Oligocene age. Further refinement of the formation's age using radiometric dating of sanidine crystals has resulted in an age of 34 million years old. This places the formation in the Late Eocene Priabonian stage. At the time of description the holotype specimen, number 2917 was deposited in the Museum of Comparative Zoology paleontology collections at Harvard University. Along with a number of other insect type specimens, the A. donisthorpei holotype is part of the Samuel Hubbard Scudder insect collection donated to Harvard in 1902. The fossil was first studied by paleoentomologist Frank M. Carpenter of the Museum of Comparative Zoology; in 1930 his type description of the new species was published in the Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. The etymology for the specific epithet donisthorpei was not specified with the type description, but Horace Donisthorpe (1870‚Äì1951) was a British myrmecologist and coleopterist. A. donisthorpei was one of two Aphaenogaster species from the Florissant Formation that Carpenter described in the paper, the other species being Aphaenogaster mayri.  Description  The Aphaenogaster donisthorpei specimen is a partially preserved queen caste adult which was fossilized with its dorsal side facing upwards and the attached wings outspread. The overall length of the queen is approximately , the head has an estimated length of and the thorax is estimated at . The antennae are long and slender in appearance, composed of a scape that is extends past the hind margin of the head and funicular segments which are twice as long are they are wide. The preserved forewing is long and has venation similar to that of A. mayri. The two are distinguished based on the more slender nature of A. donisthorpei with longer head and thorax proportions.

Coglin was born at Ballynote, in the county of Sligo to an old and honorable family. His uncle, Dr. Boyce, of Tullamore, county Roscommon, was a noted horse breeder. In 1831 he, his parents, brothers and sisters sailed for Tasmania in the Lindsay, captain Fenton, arriving in Hobart on 24 June. After completing his education in Hobart he was articled to Mr. Biggins, a prominent architect and builder. In 1836 or 1837 he left in the Lady Liverpool for South Australia, where he married Mrs. Frances Gerrard, the mother of William Gerrard of Yolo Station at Rapid Bay. Shortly after his arrival he purchased from Charles Beaumont Howard, the Colonial Chaplain, land in Hindley Street and opened a timber- yard, which developed into a flourishing business, bringing in Tasmanian timber, and when the Burra mines were opened up he purchased the site upon which the Napoleon and Royal Exchange Hotels later stood, to cope with the expanded business. He built the first Napoleon Hotel, and was its landlord for many years. He purchased more land about the corner of Waymouth and King William Streets, which he later sold at a great profit. He invested in pastoral properties, in which he was equally successful. About 1877 he purchased a section of land adjoining Brompton and laid it out as a township, giving it the name of Brompton Park, where resided until his death. Coglin Street is a major thoroughfare in this area. Politics In 1860 Coglin was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly for the district of Port Adelaide. This Parliament lasted from 1860 to 1862, and in 1863 he was returned for the same constituency, for which he sat until 1864. At the general election of 1865 he was elected for the district of Light, which he represented until 1868, when the fourth Parliament was dissolved. He remained out of the House for three years, but in 1871 he was elected for West Adelaide. Three years later he again retired from politics, reappearing in 1875 as member for Flinders, holding his seat for seven years, being re- elected in 1875 and 1878. In 1881 and 1882 he was once more out of the House, but was returned in 1883 and he sat until 1884. At the general election of that year he was returned with Thomas Burgoyne for the newly constituted district of Newcastle, but since 1887, when he had to give place to the Hon. T. Playford, who had been beaten at East Torrens, he did not occupy a seat in the House. At the general election of 1890 he stood for West Adelaide, but was defeated, and was also unsuccessful at the South Australian Legislative Council elections in 1891. At one time he took considerable interest in municipal matters and was elected mayor of Hindmarsh in December, 1888, remaining in office for one year. Dubbed \\"Polysyllabic Coglin\\" for his love and frequent use of long and obscure words, his \\"absolute fearlessness in denouncing friend and foe alike\\", his wit and good humour, hard work and dedication endeared him to his constituents. Unostentatiously benevolent, he was held in high regard by Catholic and Protestant alike Other interests He took a keen interest in thoroughbred racing, and it was owing to his exertions that the original grandstand was erected on the Old Adelaide Racecourse, and a lease of the course was obtained from the City Corporation. For some years he had a large stud at Smithfield, which was broken up a few years before his death, the horses being disposed of in Melbourne in 1884. He was for many years a prominent Freemason, but in 1892 renounced all such associations in order to comply with what were then requirements of the Roman Catholic Church, into which he had been baptised and confirmed. He died after several months of ill health and was buried with his mother, who was interred in 1877 in the family vault in the Catholic section of the West Terrace Cemetery. His wife died on 17 October 1883, at the age of 76, and was interred in an elaborate mausoleum in the West Terrace Cemetery. They had no surviving children.

Early life Sharabati was born in Damascus in 1909, during Ottoman rule. His father, Uthman al-Sharabati, was a well-established merchant and a financier of the nationalist resistance movement against French Mandatory rule, which began in 1920. Ahmad was an engineer by trade, obtaining his graduate degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, after being a student at the American University of Beirut.Moubayed, 2006, p. 332. Political career =French Mandatory rule= Sharabati returned to Damascus where he operated a tobacco plant and as an representative for General Motors. In 1933, he helped co-found the Arab nationalist and anti- colonial organization, the League of National Action (LNA). The LNA called for the liberation of Arab countries from French and British rule and for the post-colonial economic integration of the Arab world. He left the LNA in 1936 to join the most prominent independence movement in Mandatory Syria, the National Bloc. Sharabati struck a particular alliance with the National Bloc's Damascus-based leaders, such as Shukri al-Quwatli and Jamil Mardam Bey. Sharabati ran for parliament as a representative of Damascus in 1943, winning the seat. He was appointed by Prime Minister Fares al-Khoury education and national economy minister in March 1945. A year later, Syria gained full independence from France and was appointed defense minister by Prime Minister Saadallah al-Jabiri, despite scant knowledge and experience in military affairs. Sharabati's ally, President Quwatli tasked him to establish the post- independent Syrian Army and was entrusted to win the favor of officers, which he was not able to do successfully.

He lived at Villa Franca, Park Road, now a listed building.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk, Villa Franca, Tiverton. Dunsford is described in Lewis Namier's The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III as the leader of a movement in Tiverton for extending the local franchise, at the end of the 18th century. Holding local political office as a Churchwarden, he opposed the Ryder family who controlled the parliamentary elections in the town. In 1781 he set up a petition to Parliament, presented through James Townsend, for greater electoral rights. The political interests of Nathaniel Ryder, 1st Baron Harrowby, and his ally Sir John Duntze, 1st Baronet, were not in fact threatened in any practical sense by the Dissenter faction led by Dunsford.

It was one of three significant forts which the British built on the major rivers in the Northeast to cut off the natives water way to the ocean (also see Fort Halifax and Fort Pownall).https://archive.org/stream/acg3054.0001.005.umich.edu#page/364/mode/2up On September 13, 1758, Robert Monckton and a strong force of regulars and rangers (Gorham's Rangers, Danks' Rangers and Rogers' Rangers) left Halifax, and arrived at the mouth of the St. John River a week later.

(Fort Frederick (Maine) was decommissioned the following year.) During the American Revolution, American Privateers pillaged and burned Fort Frederick in the Raid on St. John (1775). After the St. John River expedition, under the command of Gilfred Studholme, the fort was replaced with Fort Howe.

It was first released on January 22, 2011 at the Sundance Film Festival and is the first film he has directed in English. Synopsis Simon is a seemingly ordinary biology teacher that spends much of his spare time caring for his Alzheimers-ridden mother Helga. This ends up not being the case, as Simon believes himself to be a vampire and spends much of his time looking at online sites for suicidal women who would make for easy prey. One such woman, Jellyfish, is tricked into believing that she and Simon will both be killing one another, only for Simon to drink her blood after he administers sleeping pills and draws blood from her. Along with his vampiric hobby, Simon tries to keep his mother indoors by putting her in a straitjacket-esque contraption tied to several large balloons. It is when Simon meets Laura that things begin to unravel, as she grows obsessed with him to the point where she breaks into his home. Things begin to further devolve when Renfield, a man who also believes himself to be a vampire, emerges onto the scene and is far more violent than Simon ever dared to be. Cast Production Iwai was inspired to create Vampire after he \\"got the idea about a serial killer who was more like a friend to his victims\\" and liked the question of \\"if the victims are working with the killer in helping kill themselves, would it be considered murder or aided suicide?\\". While further developing the idea for Vampire Iwai wanted to \\"strip away the romantic idea behind vampirism\\", but also wanted to explore the idea of a vampire that is \\"not a supernatural creature but rather a real human being\\". He based the character of Simon partially on \\"the strange habits that we all have\\" and stated that if he had not come up with the idea of Simon, he would have likely passed on Vampire's theme. Iwai penned the script for Vampire himself. However, as Iwai had difficulty with spoken English dialogue, asked the performers to \\"not follow the script too closely and try to be more spontaneous so that the dialogue would be natural.\\" Actor Kevin Zegers was asked to perform in the film after Iwai met Zegers while dining with friends. Zegers immediately accepted and was one of the first actors brought in. Filming for Vampire took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada during spring of 2010, and Zegers later stated that the process was very taxing due to the film's nature. Iwai confirmed this, saying that the weather was \\"always gray and rainy, which can bring the mood down\\" and that he \\"gave a lot of freedom to Kevin with his character, Simon, so he really took on the sadness and troubles Simon‚Äôs character was going through.\\" Reception Critical reception for Vampire has been mixed. Much of the film's criticism stemmed from its length, as media outlets such as Screen Daily and the Montreal Gazette felt that it detracted from the film's overall story. Variety praised Iwai‚Äôs \\"fastidiously composed scenes of ritual bloodletting\\" as one moment where the film \\"springs to life\\", but remarked that the film had a limited appeal. The Hollywood Reporter had a similar opinion in their review, with the bottom line reading \\"Artsy but alienating quasi-horror film offers a non- supernatural alternative to Count Dracula.\\" io9 was more positive in their review, stating \\"Fans of more traditional vampire fare may not find what they‚Äôre looking for in this piece, but anyone who has seen Iwai‚Äôs other work, especially his masterpiece of oddball suspense Pikunikku (Picnic), will be right at home with his American debut.\\" Reviewers for Twitch Film gave predominantly positive reviews, echoing io9's sentiments and stating that \\"for those not turned off by some graphic violence and a whole lot of artistic license, there is a lot to like about this portrait of a killer more empathetic than psychopathic.\\" =Awards= *Grand Jury Prize for World Cinema - Dramatic at the Sundance Film Festival (2011, nominated) *Festival Prize at the Strasbourg International Film Festival (2011, won) *Special Mention for Feature Film at the Fantasia Film Festival (2011, won) References External links * * Vampire on Fearnet Category:2011 films Category:2011 horror films Category:Films directed by Shunji Iwai Category:Vampires in film ","title":"Vampire (2011 film)"},{"id":"42135795","text":"Walter \\"Gid\\" Miller (September 25, 1887 - December 19, 1959) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player.

Sidse Babett Knudsen, Tom Skerritt and Sarita Choudhury also star in this international co-production between France, Germany, the Cayman Islands, Mexico, and the United States. The film was released on April 22, 2016, by Lionsgate, Roadside Attractions and Saban Films. Plot Alan Clay (Tom Hanks) is a salesman for American tech company Relyand, who is sent to sell a holographic teleconferencing system to the Saudi government by overseeing a presentation for the King of Saudi Arabia. The only reason he was offered the job in Saudi Arabia was that he had once met a nephew of the King. Alan is haunted by his former job at bicycle manufacturer Schwinn where he was responsible for outsourcing production to China which led to several hundred people losing their jobs and, in the long run, the financial ruin of the company. He is also depressed because of a messy and costly divorce which leaves him destitute and unable to financially support his daughter Kit (Tracey Fairaway). Oversleeping on the first day due to jet lag, he misses the shuttle bus to the King's Metropolis of Economy and Trade (a fictionalized version of King Abdullah Economic City),Steven Holden, Review: ‚ÄòA Hologram for the King‚Äô Is Elevated by Tom Hanks‚Äôs Portrayal of an American Everyman, The New York Times, April 21, 2016, accessed April 22, 2016. where the sales presentation is to take place. He instead rents a car with a driver. The driver, Yousef (Alexander Black), tells him that he is in contact with a woman and her wealthy husband is jealous, leading Yousef to fear for his life. After arriving at the development, Alan is informed that neither the King nor his direct contact, Karim Al-Ahmed (Khalid Laith), are there. He furthermore sees that his team is placed in a tent outside the office building where there is no working internet connection or food. Over the following few days Alan repeatedly oversleeps and calls Yousef to drive him to the development, both becoming closer during the long drives. At the development, he is repeatedly put off and confined to the tent outside the office building. One day, he slips inside the building and meets Danish executive Hanne (Sidse Babett Knudsen). She is sympathetic to his plight but cannot help him get in contact with the King or Karim Al-Ahmed. She offers him some alcohol, which Alan has missed since arriving in Saudi Arabia. In the evening, Alan gets drunk using the alcohol obtained from Hanne, and tries to cut open a lump he had noticed earlier on his back. Waking the next day, covered with blood from the cut, he goes to a hospital where he meets his doctor, Zahra (Sarita Choudhury) resulting in an immediate connection. She performs a biopsy and asks him to return in a few days for the result. After more days in the tent without progress in meeting the king or Karim Al-Ahmed, Alan is invited by Hanne to a party at the Danish consulate, where she tries to seduce him. Alan, however, rejects her advances. The next day, having discovered that air conditioning in the tent has broken down, Alan becomes upset. He once again slips into the office building of the development and finally meets Karim Al-Ahmed. Alan tells Karim about all his grievances: the tent with improper air conditioning, bad internet connection and missing food. Karim ensures him that he will take care of the problems but cannot give him a date for the presentation to the King. Shortly after, Alan has a panic attack in the hotel and, mistaking it for a stroke, calls Zahra and Yousef. Yousef, arriving shortly after Zahra, notices how close they are and, after she leaves, chastises Alan for endangering her by making advances to her, something Alan vehemently denies. Yousef then confesses that he fears even more for his life because the husband of the woman that Yousef is interested in has threatened him. He decides to flee to his home town over the weekend to let things cool down and Alan decides to go with him. After returning from the trip with Yousef, Alan learns that his lump contains precancerous cells and should be removed the next day. When returning to the development, Alan notices that the technical problems have been taken care of and he is informed that the King will watch the presentation that day, which is successful. However, Alan sees the officials talking with a Chinese company who ultimately can offer a better product at a cheaper rate than Alan's company. It is implied that the government had always planned to make a deal with the Chinese, and knowingly wasted Alan's time. Afterwards, Alan again rejects Hanne's advances. The next day, the operation begins with an unknown doctor but, at the last moment, Zahra takes over, to the delight of Alan. After the successful procedure, Alan and Zahra exchange increasingly personal and intimate e-mails which culminate in a secret meeting between the two. They talk about their families, with Zahra explaining that she has children and is also going through a messy divorce. They are driven to a beach house which belongs to Zahra where they go swimming and then have sex. The film ends with Alan writing to Kit telling her that the deal did not happen but that he has taken a well-paid job in Saudi Arabia (implied to be selling office space and apartments in new developments) and that he has found a new positive force in his life (implied to be Zahra, with whom he has started a relationship).

His paintings, both Realist, Naturalist in effect, principally represented intricate landscape paintings or elaborate flower settings, much as the work of his older brother, the artist Henri Biva (1848‚Äì1929). Paul Biva was a distinguished member of National Horticultural Society of France from 1898 until his untimely death two years later.Jardins de France, Soci√©t√© nationale d'horticulture de France, 1900 Biography Biva Paul was raised in a family originally from Alsace and Grisons. His father, Charles Biva (1821 Mulhouse ‚Äì 1884 Paris) was a graphic designer and entrepreneur. In 1845 he opened a wallpaper factory in Montmartre. Very young, the two brothers, Paul and Henri Biva, learned to draft designs for the family business. Biva's delicacy and sureness of line features, colors and compositions of bouquets and still lifes comes in part from this particular training‚Äîalso in the artistic context of Montmartre at the time. Paul Biva, Le Matin √† Villeneuve l‚Äô√âtang (1873), mus√©e des beaux-arts de Troyes In addition to the burden of work for the family business, Paul Biva enlisted in the Garde Nationale for compulsory military service during a difficult political and social period: the War of 1870 just ended, initiating the insurgency period of the City of Paris.Journal Officiel de la Commune de Paris After the Salon of 1878, Paul Biva almost continuously exhibited to Salon des artistes fran√ßais and other salons in Paris and Province until his untimely death in 1900. The Baron Alphonse James de Rothschild purchased Chrysanth√®mes, exhibited by Paul Biva at the Salon of 1893 and donated to the Mus√©e de Saint-Malo.L'Art: revue hebdomadaire illustr√©e, 1894 Paul Biva lived at 128, rue du Faubourg- Poissonni√®re, and from 1897 at 12, rue d'Hauteville, according to the catalogue of 1912 Salon de la Soci√©t√© des artistes fran√ßais.Title unknown, L'Interm√©diaire des chercheurs et curieux, Volume 100, Benj. Duprat, Libraire de l'Institut, 1937] ≈íuvre His artistic legacy mixes the baroque tradition of Dutch still lifes, the simplicity of Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin (1699‚Äì1779), rediscovered at the time by the artistic community, and the energy of painters Realist painting after the biennial Salon of 1850. Thereafter, Paul Biva became sensitive to Impressionist movement of the 1870s.Janet Whitmore, Ph.D., a biography of Paul Biva The influence of the artistic environment in Montmartre also played a vital role, as expressed by Andr√© Roussard:Andr√© Roussard, Dictionnaire des peintres √† Montmartre, aux XIXe et XXe si√®cle, Montmartre, March 1999 > From Romanticism of the 1830s to Surrealism of the 1820s, we can state that > Montmartre was at the origin, or at least involved in the creative period of > the various successive movements.

Paul Biva, A basket of roses (Fresh from the garden), oil on canvas, 73.1 x 92.6 cm From Biva's first exhibition at the Salon des artistes fran√ßais of 1878 until his death, the works of Paul Biva had been recognized and appreciated by the public and critics, as evidenced by articles commenting on the numerous exhibitions in which he participated.Gallica, Bulletin des Soci√©t√©s artistiques de l‚Äôest, 1900 Whereas his brother Henri Biva focused primarily on landscapes representing the western suburbs of Paris in the plein-air tradition, Paul Biva's favorite subjects were flowers, especially roses and peonies in full bloom. He paid great attention to the subtly nuanced variations of direct and reflected light on flower petals, while using vivid contrasts to highlight the expressive colors of his subject matter. > M. Paul Biva, landscape artist with a particular preference for flowers, was > in the genre one of the most skilled and brightest artists of our time; his > colorations are always, without ever exceeding the threshold of the natural > world, vivid and explosive [√©clatantes], and his motifs harmoniously > composed [...] many landscapes of always fresh tonality, flowers and fruits, > are highly acclaimed and sought after by collectors. (Bulletin des Soci√©t√©s > artistiques de l‚Äôest, 1900) Aside from his paintings, the illustrative skills of Paul Biva are revealed in his drawings that he realized for the illustrated catalogs of the Salon des artistes fran√ßais between 1878 and 1901.Catalogue Illustr√© du Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais, 1878‚Äì1901 The Biva family Paul Biva, Paysage (La rivi√®re), oil on canvas, 46 x 61 cm The literature in the press often confuses the two brothers, Paul's work is sometimes likened to that of Henri Biva, the elder who lived 30 years longer, and whose production was therefore much more abundant.

If at first, from 1873, the young Paul Biva was influenced by the zeitgeist for genre scenes and landscapes‚Äîelecting to paint landscapes that evoke those of Jean-Baptiste Corot‚Äîhe subsequently explored other paths and other subjects. His flowers became more expressive, vigorous yet delicate and full of freshness, while Henri Biva's landscapes offered an intimate glimpse of a specific locale, characterized by intricate strokes and a pure palette bathed with warm natural light. Both Bivas devoted great attention to light effects.Janet Whitmore, Ph.D., a biography of Henri Biva Paul Biva's wife, Julienne Jouatte, niece of the painter Alphonse Jouatte (1827-1892), exhibited a still-life with fruit (Nature morte aux fruits) at the Salon in 188Catalogue Illustr√© du Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais, ann√©e 1883.

Front row, centre: Carvalho Leite Hotel Pal√°cio Quitandinha Nicolas Ladany (also Nicolau Ladanyi, born 7 April 1889Di√°rio Oficial da Uni√£o, 1940-07-31, p. 5: \\"A Nicolau Ladanyi, natural da Hungria, nascido, a 7 de abril de 1889, filho de Martin Ladanyi e de Mitria Zoldi, casado, residente nesta Capital.\\" (naturalisation notices).\\\\- unknown) was a Hungarian association football coach. Most notable are his two Championships of Rio de Janeiro with Botafogo FC in 1931 and 1932. He later became an identity of the show business of Rio de Janeiro.  Career  Capit√£o Ladany, Captain Ladany, as he was very frequently referred to, was a footballer and served in the Austria armed forces. After World War I he emigrated to the United States of America where he undertook specialised studies in sports training and became a naturalised citizen in order to run a gymnasium. Reportedly, he was for an extended period director of the Aeskulap Health Institute of New York.Di√°rio da No√≠te (RJ): \\"Meia hora de palestra com o capit√£o Nickolas Ladany, technico de Botafogo\\", 28 December 1931, p. 6. In 1930 he moved to Brazil where he was employed by the legendary president of Botafogo FC, of Rio de Janeiro, later known as Botafogo FR, Paulo Azeredo as \\"technical director.\\"The common Portuguese term \\"t√©cnico\\" for a football coach would derive from \\"director technico.\\" His employment occurred in the midst of the 1930 season of the Championship of Rio de Janeiro and at that time the sports director at the club was the medical doctor Victor Guisard and the coaching was in the hands of the Englishman Charles Williams, the former Manchester City goalkeeper. Ladany's brief included deploying a psychoanalysis based training programme, which Williams disagreed with. Williams resigned and was initially retained as assistant coach alongside star-player Nilo Braga before quickly moving on to CR Flamengo.S√©rgio Augusto: Botafogo: entre o c√©u e o inferno. Ediouro Publica√ß√µes, 2004.Roberto Assaf, Cl√≥vis Martins: Campeonato Carioca: 96 anos de hist√≥ria, 1902-1997, Irradia√ß√£o Cultural, 1997, p. 156, 191. Under the stewardship of Ladany Botafogo went on to win the championship by the end of the year, the up to then only fourth title of Botafogo. After finishing only fourth in 1931 Botafogo was champion once more in 1932, with only one defeat and two draws in 22 matches. Stars of Botafogo in that era were players like Carvalho Leite, the team's top-scorer Nilo Braga and Martim Silveira. Botafogo would in this period, which describes the first \\"golden era\\" of the club, win also the three championships from 1933 to 1935. However, the latter successes occurred in a period when there were two simultaneous championships in Rio, primarily because the clubs were divided by their attitude towards professionalisation. Ladany himself was an opponent of professionalism, as he thought, Rio could only carry three or four professional teams, and top teams like his Botafogo, had only about four players who would be suitable as professionals. Similar success for Botafogo would only recur in the late 1950s and early 1960s, coinciding with the third presidency of Azeredo, when the side fronted by Garrincha, Nilton Santos and Valdir \\"Didi\\" Perreira would win three championships. By mid 1933, during the course of the season, Ladany switched to crosstown rivals America FC of the new dissident competition of the Liga Carioca de Football, which organised in that year the first professional season in Rio.Jornal dos Sports: \\"Partem hoje as delega√ß√µes de America e Fluminense\\", 14 July 1933, p. 1. At Botafogo Ladany was replaced by Victor Guisard. America finished only fifth out of six teams in its league. Until July 1933 he had also served in the Football Commission of AMEA, the governing body of Rio's football since 1924; in consequence of the schism on Rio's football Ladany's fellow members Harry Welfare, Lu√≠z Vinhaes (the coach of the national team at the \`1934 World Cup in Italy) and Jayme Barcellos had already resigned by February, leaving the capit√£o as the only commissioner then.Jornal dos Sports: \\"Tres demiss√µees num total de quattro membros\\", 18 February 1933, p. 1 Ladany also acted, at least on occasions, as coach of its selective team.A Noite (RJ): \\"O presidente da Amea desligou diversos representantes de commiss√µes\\", 4 July 1933, p. 11 After his brief time with America, which did not last beyond early February 1934 he went back to the USA for a brief period, where he reported, that he was involved with the training of the USA national team in preparation for the 1934 World Cup. He also reported of the difficulties assembling a strong side, because most players would be from abroad, from countries like Scotland and Spain. He mentioned, on his return in May 1934, that stars there would make in \\"average 40.000 dollars per year.\\"Di√°rio da Noite (RJ): \\"O Am√©rica pretende apresentar um grande team em 1934\\", 2 February 1934, p. 6.Di√°rio da Noite (RJ): \\"A bordo do ¬´Southern Cross¬ª regressou o capit√£o Ladany\\", 25 May 1934, p. 7. From October 1934 he was hired as instructor at Liga de Sports da Marinha, the sports club of the navy. Under Ladany's stewardship their football team took take part in qualifying matches for the Campeonato dos Campe√µes of 1936, organised by the Federa√ß√£o Brasileira de Futebol.Liga de Sports da Marinha was founded in 1915 by navy officers.

In 1938 he became associated with the Casino in Urca, in those days known through stars like Carmen Miranda, where he worked for the publicity department.O Imparcial (RJ): Anniversarios, 27 May 1938, p. 12. Later he became artistic director there. In May 1939 he returned for a few weeks to Botafogo, where he was part of the staff of coach Jos√© \\"Juca da Praia\\" Ferreira Lemos, whose job later on that year would handed to the great Izidor K√ºrschner.O Imparcial: \\"A nova direc√ß√£o technica do Botafogo F.C. em actividade\\", 10 May 1939, p. 8. In the early 1940s he still served the Liga de Sports of the navy. Until the late 1950s or even into the 1960s Ladany, then called a person \\"closely associated with the show business of Rio in the era of the casinos,\\" was \\"social director\\" (director social) of the famous Hotel Quitandinha in Petr√≥polis north of Rio, which in that era hosted international stars like Jayne Mansfield.Correio da Manha (RJ): \\"Gatos pardos\\", 12 February 1959, p. 15. Nicolau Ladany's daughter, Gl√≥ria Ladany, started about 1955 as a dancer in the large variety shows of Carlos Machado, and became inside a few years an actress, over the next couple of decades frequently seen in the theatres of Rio de Janeiro.

Biography Howard was born on May 20, 1951 in Dallas, Texas. She graduated with a doctorate in veterinary medicine from Texas A&M; in 1980. She earned a PhD in reproductive physiology from University of Maryland in 1989. Dr. Howard received her D.V.M. from Texas A&M; University in 1980, and Ph.D. from the University of Maryland in 1989. Originally a veterinarian, Howard later became an expert in animal breeding, receiving the nickname \\"Sperm Queen\\".‚Äù She used common human infertility treatments, like artificial insemination and In vitro fertilisation, and was a pioneer in electroejaculation techniques. In 1980, she began working at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Washington, D.C. She oversaw the black-footed ferret breeding program at The National Zoo. With her aid more than 500 kits were born and 150 artificial inseminations were performed. In 1992, alongside the Nashville Zoo President Rick Schwartz, she conducted the first successful clouded leopard artificial insemination. \\"If we lose this species,\\" Howard says of the clouded leopards, \\"that means we probably lose other species in the forest. We may lose the forest all together. It may affect the human race eventually. I think most people want to just see these animals and want their future generations to see these animals. They are unique and nothing's going to replace a clouded leopard.\\"\\" From 1998 to 2000, Howard surveyed giant pandas in China. This study helped identify the causes of poor reproduction, which led to a rise in the population of giant pandas in breeding centers and zoos over the next ten years. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not an emotional person,‚Äù she once told a reporter. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs pretty cool when you realize you‚Äôre putting these animals back where they should be.‚Äù She died from cancer on March 5, 2011 in Washington D.C.

The practice has been established since the beginning of NASCAR in 1949. However, owner-drivers are almost nonexistent today in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, primarily due to the expense and responsibilities involved, essentially having two jobs in one. However, there are many owner- driver teams in the lower tier Xfinity Series and Gander Outdoors Truck Series. Owner-driver is not to be confused with a driver who owns a separate team, such as Dale Earnhardt, who fielded his own team but still drove for RCR. History When NASCAR started in the late 1940s nearly all drivers owned their cars and would drive their car to the track. While sponsorship was useful, it was not essential to win at this time, leaving less burden for the driver. But by the 1970s and 1980s more and more drivers drove for another team. Since 1980, with the exception of Alan Kulwicki and Tony Stewart (1992 and 2011, respectively), no NASCAR Cup Series champion was an owner-driver.

Earlier that week, on November 24, Omnivore reissued the French compilation Dead Center as an omnibus release on CD, encompassing material from both EPs and additional tracks. At the request of Fred Juhos, the reissue of Dead Center omitted all songs written by Juhos, which became available exclusively on the EP releases and their associated digital downloads. Thematic notes Scott Miller during recording of Distortion in 1983 In 1990, Scott Miller pointed to \\"The Red Baron\\" as the song that \\"crystallized the style of a class of my songs I‚Äôve called young- adult-hurt-feeling-athons.\\" Analyzing the themes of Game Theory's early work, Harvard professor Stephen Burt wrote: > A teen's sense of social exclusion runs through many of Miller's early > songs, but so does his enthusiasm when (to his surprise) he fits in ... > These well-educated kids know better than to cast themselves as complete > outcasts. Self-knowledge defeats their self-pity, but that defeat does not > lead to other victories. It might not even help them get a date, despite > desperate measures: \\"Let‚Äôs get out the Twister game and get down on all > fours,\\" suggested \\"Nine Lives to Rigel Five,\\" from Distortion (1983), though > its arrangements are hardly four-on-the-floor. \\"Nine Lives to Rigel Five,\\" according to AllMusic's Stewart Mason, \\"obliquely concerns one of Scott Miller's favorite topics, the disconnect between childhood wonder and adult reality.\\" In the original Star Trek episodes of the 1960s, the star Rigel and its numbered planets had been mentioned numerous times. Mason wrote, \\"Anyone who was a kid during the '50s and '60s space race had been told by no less an authority than Scientific American that by 1984, we'd all be living on the moon and driving personal spaceships, and the fact that we're not is, on some level, still something of a disappointment.\\"  Critical response and legacy  The Michigan Daily, in a 1984 review, called Distortion \\"near-perfect vaguely retrograde pop, with consummately whiny adolescent vocals by Scott Miller and gorgeous tunes by the same.\\" Pointing to producer Michael Quercio as a \\"neo-psychedelic whimsy-pop superstar,\\" the review also cited the \\"addictive melody\\" and \\"lyrics of the century\\" in \\"Nine Lives to Rigel Five,\\" and called \\"Shark Pretty\\" a \\"thumping must at any party.\\" In the early 1990s, comparing Distortion to the earlier Blaze of Glory LP, Trouser Press found Distortion to be \\"fuller, but not as fresh sounding\\", stating that \\"Miller's fey falsetto and fragile melodies\\" were rendered \\"too precious\\" by a \\"more baroque presentation.\\" Conversely, AllMusic critic Ned Raggett wrote that on Distortion, Scott Miller \\"practically defines winsome vocal sweetness spiked with bite,\\" calling the EP \\"some beautiful art pop,\\" and \\"one set of treats after another.\\" Raggett added that \\"the band collectively put in great performances,\\" crediting Dave Gill's \\"rumbling drum punch\\" and Nancy Becker's keyboard lead on \\"Nine Lives to Rigel Five,\\" which another reviewer called \\"gloriously cheesy synth-pop riffs.\\" Assessing Gill's percussion on \\"Nine Lives to Rigel Five,\\" Stephen Burt wrote, \\"It sounds old- school science-fictional, early-digital, like late Devo, or late Yes. The chorus imagines exile via starship, propelled by what sounds like, not a drum machine, but electronic drums, the kind with hexagonal heads.\\" In the 2002 book All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul, reviewer Stewart Mason cited \\"Shark Pretty\\" for its \\"exultant charge\\" and \\"some of the band's strongest-sounding guitar yet,\\" provided by guest soloist Earl Slick. Mason also pointed to \\"The Red Baron\\" as an example of the EP's \\"stellar material,\\" calling it an \\"anguished acoustic lost-love song\\" with its heartbreak lightened by \\"keyboardist Nancy Becker's mocking 'Fifty or more' backing vocal,\\" which tied the song's title to the Royal Guardsmen's 1966 novelty song \\"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron.\\" Miller and Becker's \\"dreamy acoustic strum and synth\\" in \\"The Red Baron\\" were also cited by Raggett as contributing to the \\"breezy sweetness of the band.\\" = Later performances = In 1999, \\"Nine Lives to Rigel Five\\" was covered by the band Gaze on their album Shake the Pounce. Game Theory's 2013 reunion performance, a memorial tribute to Scott Miller, included \\"The Red Baron,\\" and the set closed with the upbeat \\"Too Late for Tears\\" and \\"Shark Pretty.\\" In 2014, Donnette Thayer recorded a cover of \\"The Red Baron\\" for a Scott Miller memorial tribute album that remains unreleased. Thayer, who had been a member of Game Theory from 1986 to 1988, released a music video of her version.

He took work in the West Country, and lived for a time in Honiton, in east Devon. There he encountered Eliza Gould, who was running a school at South Molton, elsewhere in the same county. They became involved, and engaged in 1795, but he broke it off, and did not give financial support to her school as she certainly had hoped. After 1796, he moved to Salisbury, and then in 1799 to London. He died by 1815.

It was edited with notes by Robert Airey for the Manx Society, in 1861, as Feltham's Tour through the Isle of Man, in 1797 and 1798. A work on monumental inscriptions in the Isle of Man was published for the first time in 1868.

The story follows several Malaysians of different races and a Bangladeshi worker as they come together to defend the country comically against the invasion of the fictional Luk Luk Kingdom. The cast includes Namewee himself, Bangladeshi actor Nirab Hossain, Malaysian artists Saiful Apek, David Arumugam of the Alleycats, Shashi Tharen, Zhu Youliu, Singaporean artists Atikah Suhaime and Yoo Ah Min/Lao Zha Bor. The budget was more than RM 2 million, and was shot in Kuala Lumpur's Petaling Street. The film was made in 2013. Despite having completed filming in that year, Namewee revealed in a 2014 video that the Film Censorship Board of Malaysia had banned the original film version over scrutiny of 31 scenes that were deemed objectionable by the board. The original uncut version was shown in 2015 at three film festivals. On 12 February 2019, five years later, after having 7 scenes reedits or cut, a small reshoot and updates, the board finally approved Banglasia for public screening in Malaysia, retitled Banglasia 2.0. Synopsis The film focuses on three characters from different backgrounds: Harris (Nirab Hossain), a Bangladeshi worker in Malaysia who just wants to return to hometown to marry the love of his life; Hanguoren (Namewee), a pro- Malaysian activist who wants his fellow citizens to join him in regaining the country in its natural state without immigrants; and Rina (Atikah Suhaime), an idealistic daughter of a boss who has fallen for Harris at first sight. The trio, along with several other characters, have to survive the sudden invasion of the nearby fictional Luk Luk Kingdom. The films touches and satires on social issues such as corruption, inequality, human trafficking, ethnic relations and also the cultural understandings between the characters.

The board states 31 scenes that is objectionable. Deleting or altering all 31 scenes would require major re-shootings of the film, and because those points are major plot for most of the film, reshootings seems unlikely. After several twists and turns, Banglasia was officially declared banned.Namewee film suddenly banned One of the reasons the first versions of the movie was banned was that it portrayed sympathetically the gay lifestyle in Malaysia. The Malaysian Home Ministry claimed that the film ‚Äúaccentuated negative sociocultural lifestyles such as lesbian gay bisexual transgender (LGBT)‚Äù and at the same time ‚Äúridiculed the capacity and role of security troops in maintaining peace as well as national security.‚Äù Ben Child; ‚ÄúMalaysian film promoting LBGT rights banned for 'mocking national security'‚Äù, The Guardian, March 3, 2016. Nevertheless, the original uncut film version was publicly shown for the first time in Southeast Asia at the Singapore International Film Festival held in December 2015, also at the New York Asian Film Festival and Osaka Asian Film Festival in the same year. In 2019, after several times of appealing, the film was finally unbanned. =Kickstarter campaign= In December 2015, Namewee had opened up a Kickstarter campaign seeking to raise USD 500,000 within 40 days to partially recoup their initial production cost of more than RM4 million (USD 1 million) so that they can afford to release the movie globally for free. Part of the funds would be used to pay for extra post-production editing, and qualified donors would receive their mentions of name in the front and end credits. Wee however failed to reach his accomplished goal as he confirmed on his Facebook page where he only collected USD 186,468, which did not even reach half of his intended money needed. =Banning lifted and Banglasia 2.0= On 12 February 2019, Banglasia movie producers received official notification of approval from the board. After a six-year wait, Namewee and the filmmakers say they are relieved that the movie will finally make it into cinemas although they have had to make cut 7 scenes and do a reshoot to update the story with new scenes to make it relevant. Scenes cut from the film include gun shooting scenes, LGBT- suggestive scenes, a scene mentioning the MyKad, and a scene which compares the safety of Malaysians and Singaporeans. The scenes cut do not affect the storyline. Namewee retitled his movie as Banglasia 2.0, announcing that his movie is headed for release in Malaysia cinemas nationwide on 28 February 2019.

Directed by Tan Tjoei Hock and produced by The Teng Chun, it starred Tan Tjen Bok, Mohamad Mochtar, and Hadidjah. Plot Robin is exiled from society after he is accused of murdering a man named Ibrahim in a fight. Twenty years later Ibrahim's son, Mahmud, begins a search for his father's killer. He soon reaches the island of Sampojo, where he finds Robin. The exile has taken up piracy and now uses the name \\"Singa Laoet\\" (The Sea Lion). After one of Robin's men, Hasan, kidnaps a girl whom he loves, Mahmud tracks the kidnapper down and fights him to the death. It is later revealed that Hasan, not Robin, was the one who killed Ibrahim. Production Singa Laoet was directed by Tan Tjoei Hock, a Chinese-Indonesian director who had been attached to The Teng Chun's Java Industrial Film since 1940; They produced the film for Action Film, a subsidiary of Java Industrial Film. Tan is also credited with the screenwriting, cinematography, and sound editing of this 76-minute-long black- and-white film. Production of this film was mostly finished by October 1941. The film starred Tan Tjeng Bok, Hadidjah, Bissu, and Mohamad Mochtar. Three of the actors had extended experience with Java Industrial Film: Bissu had made his screen debut for the company in 1938's Oh Iboe, Hadidjah had joined with her husband Mas Sardi in 1939 for Roesia si Pengkor, and Mochtar had appeared in Alang-Alang later that year after being discovered in a barbershop. Tan Tjeng Bok, a former stage star with Dardanella, was a more recent hire, only having made his film debut in the company's 1941 production Srigala Item. Release and reception Singa Laoet was released in late 1941, having reached Surabaya by November. In the city it was advertised as capable of making viewer's blood pump faster through their veins, while the panoramas of the Indies were described as picturesque and beautiful. The film was open to audiences of all ages. A reviewer in the Surabaya-based Soerabaijasch Handelsblad found that the film would likely be popular with ethnic Chinese and Native audiences. Theatrical screenings of Singa Laoet continued as late as 1945. According to J.B. Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia, a 35 mm copy of the film is held at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta.

H. G. Wells Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, accessed 15 August 2015. Story summary For several years, Monson has used his wealth on a project to build a flying machine. The apparatus for launching it, \\"a massive alley of interlacing iron and timber\\", has become a notable landmark for people passing through Worcester Park in south-west London, and sometimes they see a machine rush along the rails of the apparatus, as the latest version of the flying machine is tested. Monson's money is running out, and he is impatient with the time taken to put the latest modifications into effect. He is annoyed with the attitude of the public, who regard with amusement and indifference what is actually a painstaking and well-researched project, based on the work of Hiram Maxim and Otto Lilienthal. In particular he is annoyed by the remarks of a pretty young lady: > 'How are you getting on with your flying-machine?' she asked. ('I wonder if > I shall ever meet anyone with the sense not to ask that,' thought Monson.) > 'It will be very dangerous at first, will it not?' ('Thinks I'm > afraid.').... 'You must let me know when your flying-machine is finished, > Mr. Monson, and then I will consider the advisability of taking a ticket.' > ('One would think I was still playing inventions in the nursery.') Monson and his engineer Woodhouse agree to try a flight. They know they will not be able to manage their flight instinctively, as a bird would do. Wimbledon, Primrose Hill and Kensington Gardens are some of the places which they fly over, all the while having difficulty controlling the machine. Eventually their luck runs out and they crash near the Royal College of Science. So ends Monson's project. All that remains is the rusting ironwork at Worcester Park, and the inspiration for others to attempt creating flying machines.

It is also a vital resource for students studying art history, studio art, and museum management, who frequently serve as interns, docents, and guest curators. The Meadows Museum of Art is the second art museum resulting from the philanthropy of oilman Algur H. Meadows. The first is the Meadows Museum at Southern Methodist University. History The Meadows Museum of Art was established at Centenary College of Louisiana in 1975 on the occasion of the College's 150th anniversary. The museum was made possible by a gift from Algur H. Meadows, a Centenary alumnus. In 1969, Meadows purchased 360 pieces of original artwork from the family of the recently deceased French artist Jean Despujols for $250,000, and gave them to Centenary College for the purpose of establishing a second Meadows Museum, just four years after SMU's Meadows was opened. Meadows also gifted $200,000 to the college to remodel the 1926 Arts Building designed by Shreveport architect Edward F. Neild, into a 4000 square-foot art museum. The Arts Building has served several purposes since its construction, including: college classrooms, the library, an administration building, and today the Meadows Museum of Art. Meadows later gave an additional $150,000 to be used for museum maintenance. Unlike SMU's Meadows, which received Mr. Meadows' large Spanish art collection, Centenary's Meadows Museum began with the Indochina Collection of paintings and drawings by French Academic artist Jean Despujols, documenting his time working in Indochina for the French government between 1936 and 1938. Despujols had previously served as an art professor at Fontainebleau Academy in France in the early 20th century. His Indochina Collection is notable because Despujols' realist style accurately records the various peoples, cultures, landscapes, and religious practices present in an area now including Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, an area that would soon be permanently altered by wars and genocide. Before arriving in Shreveport, the Collection was exhibited in Hanoi and Saigon in 1938, at the Smithsonian Museum in 1950, and the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in 1952. This Collection marks one of the largest collections of French colonial art in existence. In 1951, National Geographic Magazine included twenty-one paintings from the Collection in their article \\"Portrait of Indochina.\\" Despujols immigrated to the United States during World War II, and lived in Shreveport, Louisiana until his death. Willard Cooper, a 1947 Centenary graduate, returned to the college to serve as the first art director of the museum. He also served as an art professor and chairman of the art department at Centenary. The Meadows today Since its opening, the Museum's permanent holdings have grown to around 1600 works. The Museum expanded its Indochina Collection to include the traditional Southeast Asian costumes depicted in Despujols' paintings. In addition to the Indochina Collection, works by George Grosz, Emilio Amero, Mary Cassatt, William Hogarth, and Alfred Maurer, among others, and Louisiana artists including Clyde Connell, Clementine Hunter, and Don Brown are housed in its permanent collection. Additionally, the Meadows Museum of Art owns one of the surviving copies of The Triumphal Arch of Maximilian I by Northern Renaissance artist and engraver Albrecht D√ºrer, and a substantial collection of Inuit prints and sculptures. In addition to its mission to collect and preserve important art, the Meadows Museum of Art hosts temporary exhibitions and educational programs that aim to introduce the public to diverse art forms and noteworthy artists, art historians, and curators from outside the region. Recent exhibitions include Sean Starwars, Renegade Printmaker of the South, Mali De-Kalo's Relaying--Testimonies of Motherhood Lost, Poet of the Ordinary: Photographs by Keith Carter, The Dream Series by Marlene Tseng Yu, and Images of Excellence: The O. Winston Link Centennial. To support its educational mission, the Museum never charges admission. Serving as an artistic attraction for the larger Shreveport community, The Meadows Museum of Art also plays an essential role in enriching the academic mission of the campus. Centenary's Meadows Museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM), the highest national recognition afforded the nation's museums. Accreditation signifies excellence to the museum community, governments, funders, outside agencies, and the museum-going public. The Meadows was initially accredited in 1980 and has been re-accredited three times, equating to 40 years of museum excellence.

Richmond Dimmey's ClockThe Swan St store was extensively damaged in a fire in 1906, though it continued to trade until it was rebuilt entirely in 1907. As part of a 1910 extension the building was topped with a distinctive clock tower, featuring a globe with red glass panels that were internally illuminated after dark, making it visible for several miles. At this time Jeffery also changed the business name to Dimmeys Model Stores, to reflect its high-fashion status. The tower became a landmark in Richmond, and images of it were incorporated into the company logo and marketing. In 1939 the Second World War blackout restrictions meant that the globe could not be illuminated, and as the glass windows had deteriorated they were replaced with copper panels. The store sold a variety of merchandise on the ground floor, and on the first floor were workshops and the mail order service for regional customers. During the 1930s Depression the store began to focus on quality goods at reduced prices. In the post-war period it ceased manufacturing and became a 'bargain store'.

The clock tower was painted yellow and black in 1981 to mark the 350th AFL game of Richmond footballer Kevin Bartlett. In 2004, the local artist Hayden Dewar was commissioned to paint a series of murals representing the history of the store and of Victoria since 1853 along the Green Street facade of the Swan Street store. The work stretches for 67 metres. In 2008, the building was sold to developers Richmond Icon for around $16 million. The developers later announced plans to build a ten-storey residential building on the site, preserving the heritage listed clock-tower and frontage, but including the destruction of several metres of the mural. The original plan was contested by the council on a number of grounds, with the outcome that the mural was preserved.Urban Melbourne Melbourne's History In Paint and Over 50 Incredible Metres.

It is also known as 'Dripsey Castle,' a name more properly attributed to nearby Dripsey Castle, Carrignamuck. Structure The structure is a tower house, as opposed to a castle, and was one of a chain of MacCarthy of Muskerry tower houses extending westwards beyond Macroom. Tower houses were built during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as residences by Gaelic and Old English families, and though not castles in the strict sense, retained many similar features such as battlements, machicolations and narrow slit windows. Carrignamuck is an L-shaped, five-storey tower, which was repaired in 1866 when a slate roof, fireplaces, and wooden front door were inserted. The entrance is set into the east wall, and the ground floor contains a lobby, main chamber, fireplace, smaller chamber and concrete floor. The first floor contains main, secondary, garderobe and murder-hole chambers, with one of its windows containing a timber frame said to come from the former Church of Ireland parish church at Aghabullogue. The second floor has a main chamber with fireplace, and a garderobe chamber. The third floor contains a main chamber and a smaller chamber. The fourth floor contains a main chamber with fireplace and slate roof, the remains of a smaller chamber, and access to an external wall-walk with no surviving battlements. Adjoining the tower house are terraces, which may be the result of earlier demesne landscaping. History The tower house is firstly depicted on a sketch map the description of Muskery of c. 1590 and named 'Carrigomuck'. It is also depicted on the Down Survey Map of 1656-8, with the accompanying terrier stating that 'on Carrignemucke stands a castle and a mill'. Smith (1774) describes the 'Castle of Carrignamuck' as inhabited by Mr. Bear, once belonging to the Mac-Carthys, situated on the Muskerry side of the (Dripsey) river, and having a garrison of Oliver Cromwell stationed there for some time. Lewis (1837) mentions the 'ancient castle of Carrignamuck' as built in the fifteenth century by the founder of Blarney Castle, and being situated on the bank of the Dripsey River, surrounded by trees, within the parish of Magourney. The tower house is described in the Ordnance Survey name book (c. 1840) and depicted in both the OS 1842 and 1901 surveyed maps as a ruin. Gillman (1892) advises that it was known as Carrig na Muc castle, and according to tradition was built by Cormac Laidir MacCarthy, lord of Muskerry 1455-1495. Local tradition is said to maintain that the proper name for Carrignamuck was Carrig Cormac, and that the (tower house) was named after Cormac Laidher McCarthy, the builder of Blarney Castle.Journal of the Cork Historical & Archaeological Society. XXXV. 1930 In the Tourist Association Survey of 1944, it is called 'Carrignamuck Castle' and known to be also referred to as Dripsey Castle. Cormac McTeige MacCarthy, surnamed L√°idir, 9th Lord of Muskerry, having succeeded in 1449, was said to have built the (tower house) and later died in 1494. Regarded as the official residence of the Tanist (heir in succession to Blarney Castle) it had been bombarded in 1650 from nearby Meeshal Hill by Lord Broghill (also Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery), leader of a troop of Cromwellian soldiers. The slate roof was put in place by the Colthurst family, and by 1944 it had become the property of John O'Shaughnessy, owner of Dripsey Woollen Mills. The building was locked, with a key obtainable at nearby Dripsey House. Milner (1975) also contends that the correct title of the property should be Carrig Cormac, and O'Donoghue (1986) contends that it was built in 1450 by Cormac McCarthy Laidir, and that the name was derived from a nearby location, where it was customary to slaughter pigs, so as to supply bacon to the inhabitants. Cormac McCarthy Laidir's brother Eoghan lived as tanist for a time at Carrignamuck, until Cormac was killed during an argument between them. This resulted in Eoghan's claims on the title being denied and he was debarred from succeeding. In 1580 Donyll McTeige MacCarthy (tanist of Muskerry and brother of Sir Cormac McTeige MacCarthy of Blarney Castle) resided at Carrignamuck. He was injured in a local skirmish between the forces of the MacCarthys of Muskerry and those of Sir James Fitzgerald of Desmond during the Second Desmond Rebellion and later died at Carrignamuck. Upon the death of Sir Cormac MacTeige in 1583, his next brother Callaghan succeeded as Lord of Muskerry, but gave up his position shortly afterwards in favour of a nephew, Cormac MacDermod. Callaghan was allowed to resume his residency at Carrignamuck as Lieutenant. His son Cormac later inherited the estate, but forfeited it in 1641. The Colthurst family later purchased the property and built the residence known as Dripsey Castle in the grounds. Subsequently the tower house and grounds came into the ownership of the O'Shaughnessy family. Carrignamuck tower house is not accessible to the public and is located on private property.

It originally aired on March 6, 2014, on NBC. The episode was written by Jordan Blum and Parker Deay, and directed by Rob Schrab. The episode marked the series writing debut of Blum and Deay, and the second episode in the series which Schrab directed. The episode was met with generally positive reviews, with many commenting on the original homages to Zardoz and Logan's Run; however, despite positive reviews from critics, the episode matched the previous week's ratings with a 1.0 in the 18‚Äì49 rating/share, though it improved to 2.79 million viewers ‚Äì up from 2.56 million viewers the previous week. Plot Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) discovers that Jeff (Joel McHale) has organized a dinner with the study group without inviting her, which causes a small argument between the two. Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) interrupts the conversation and introduces two app designers to the study group. Dean Pelton reveals that he is allowing the app designers to beta test their new social networking application, MeowMeowBeenz, using the Greendale staff and students. MeowMeowBeenz allows the user to rate a person between 1 and 5 MeowMeowBeenz. The app soon becomes extremely popular at Greendale, but Jeff and Britta (Gillian Jacobs) continue to reject it. Britta attempts to convince people of the app's stupidity, but is unable to get people to listen to her unless she has mustard on her face, which Annie (Alison Brie) says distracts from Britta's intensity. Jeff eventually caves in and joins the app, after discovering that Shirley has 5 MeowMeowBeenz, which makes her extremely popular amongst everyone on campus and also gives her the ability to influence what people rate others. The campus soon deteriorates into a dystopia, with the Fives and Fours controlling the school, the Threes and Twos serving them, and the Ones being exiled from the school. The group of Fives, made up of Shirley, Abed (Danny Pudi), Chang (Ken Jeong), Hickey (Jonathan Banks) and a party animal named Koogler (Mitch Hurwitz), realize that the Threes and Twos are becoming suspicious of them, and decide to host a talent show in order to give them hope. Meanwhile, Jeff, who is now a Four, conspires with Britta to enter the talent show and take down the Fives by exposing their oppressive regime. Jeff performs at the talent show, but instead of exposing the Fives' regime, performs a hilarious comedy act, which gets him voted into the Fives. With her and Jeff's plan ruined, Britta attempts to expose the regime herself, but no one will listen to her. Britta eventually puts mustard on her face, which causes everyone to pay attention to her and agree to revolt against the Fives. Meanwhile, Jeff is initiated into the Fives, but an argument between him and Shirley causes both of them to be voted down to Ones, and exiled from the school. Outside the school, both Jeff and Shirley admit that they became obsessed by the app, and apologize to each other. Jeff and Shirley are eventually let back into the school, and discover that Britta has overthrown the Fives and replaced their regime with her own oppressive regime, where everyone is a One. Jeff reveals to the school that the app's beta test ended 2 days ago and convinces everyone at the school to delete the app. With the app deleted, everyone leaves the school, leaving a powerless Britta alone. The next week, everyone returns to school and the Dean asks that everyone forget the experience, while Jeff and Shirley mend their relationship. Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, episode was watched by 2.79 million American viewers, and received an 18-49 rating/share of 1.0/3. The show placed fourth in its time-slot, behind The Big Bang Theory, American Idol, and Once Upon a Time in Wonderland; and fourteenth for the night. =Critical reception= Critics gave the episode generally positive reviews for its ambitious parody of a futuristic dystopia created because of a social media application. The criticism, however, for the episode came for being \\"messy\\" and taking narrative shortcuts that may have detracted from the story. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode a \\"B\\" and wrote that the episode felt like the writers \\"had one good idea somewhere, and then a bunch of other ideas piled on top of it, and, hey, we can get a lot of big stars to appear, so why not? And eventually, the finished product had so much going on that you couldn‚Äôt tell what the original impetus for making the movie was in the first place.\\" VanDerWerff said that it was \\"probably the weakest episode of the season\\" despite having a lot of big ideas, some of it wildly funny and impressively original. She said the episode functioned well as a social commentary on \\"the ways we try to make ourselves look better on Facebook, Twitter, and the Internet in general\\". The episode worked on a pure plot and character level, wrote VanDerWerff, in exposing our desire to be liked and admired by projecting facsimiles of ourselves in different social media platforms, while subconsciously accepting that those are the versions we want the world to see. \\"We are, in some sense, reducing ourselves to fictional characters, less susceptible to pain or anger, at least until people needle at us, and we act as if that needling is directly attacking our core selves, instead of just some projection we‚Äôve made to get more popular online.\\" Gabrielle Moss of TVFanatic, on the other hand, rated the episode 4.8 out of 5 stars, and relished how a social media app transformed Greendale into \\"one of the season's most delightful fits of whimsy\\". Moss wrote how the episode spoofs how we are one \\"poke\\" way from a fascist nightmare, with wise elders making Starburns run around dressed like the protagonist-enforcer from the film Zardoz. Moss maintained that even though this episode \\"certainly didn't compare to Abed and Hickey's knock-down fight about the meaning of emotions and selfishness in Episode 7, Abed's argument ‚Äì in favor of social networking's capacity to carefully quantify social interaction for the socially maladjusted ‚Äì was one of the more persuasive explanations in favor of social networking that I've heard.\\" She wrote how using a \\"1970s retro- futuristic sci-fi style\\" was a great way to prove what \\"appeared on the surface to be an epic take-down of social networking, proves that the episode was actually a takedown of that evergreen topic, human vanity and greed\\". She opined that the Community Season 5 is at the show's peak, especially in portraying Britta as \\"a socialist revolutionary-cum-warlord,\\" and seeing the \\"show bloom into the complicated, deranged flower that we planted five seasons ago.\\" But it's not all sunshine and deranged flowers, Moss wrote: \\"If Community Season 5 has a theme, it's about how we can all become villains without realizing it, even as we see ourselves as victims in our own stories. The removal of Pierce and the reformation of Chang has left a villainy vacancy at Greendale, and this season, everyone ‚Äì Shirley is this episode, Abed and Hickey last week, Britta in Community Season 5 Episode 5 ‚Äì seems to be trying on the crown...and everyone is finding that it fits.\\" Brian Collins of Badass Digest rated the episode a \\"B+\\" and wrote how Community is great at swinging between a high-concept episode this week after a toned-down episode the previous week without giving its fans whiplash. Collins wrote how this was a strong episode for Britta, who had been sidelined in the first few episodes: \\"[Britta] suddenly sounds more reasonable when she has mustard on the corner of her lip ('It dilutes or distracts from your excessive intensity,' Annie explains), which of course leads to the actress tossing whatever vanity she may have aside in service of a sight gag where she tries to boost her control over her audience by smearing it over her entire face.\\" Ben Umstead of Twitch Film gave a mixed review, saying how the episode displayed \\"interesting experiments in homage, but it was one experiment that didn't fully land\\". Umstead wrote how the episode started personally and intimately through an emotional rift between Shirley and Jeff, going \\"on and off the rails so many times that it was merely close to, but never quite a disaster,\\" and ending with some real meaning between the two. Umstead praised the episode's homage \\"to many a Sci-fi flick from the 70s, most notably Zardoz and Logan's Run, and of course there's a bit of H. G. Wells style future from The Time Machine\\". Umstead also praised the performance of the \\"professional party animal named Koogler (played wonderfully silly by Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz)\\" reigning as a 5 along with Shirley and getting his own Animal House- themed trailer in the end credits. But the episode pushed the plot forward at the expense of jokes: \\"So much of what works or doesn't will rely on your knowledge of dystopic satires or how much you enjoy seeing comedians Tim Heidecker, Eric Wareheim, and Jen Kirkman as disco-angel stylized 4s.\\" He writes how the episode is \\"serviceable\\" because it \\"goes so deep in the well of Community emotional tropes, as to then feel a little lazy in execution. It means well, but it also doesn't help that the basic dystopic ideas it homages and satirizes have been so overly homaged and satirized already as prerequisites for dystopic fiction anyway as to feel stale... if cute in a way.\\" Umstead pokes fun at his own review, ending by saying, \\"Maybe I should just take a lesson from Koogler and... assume the party!\\" The episode has an average rating of 9.0 out of 10 stars on IMDb.

Bologna, MCA. Ibiaw or Ibiau was an ancient Egyptian vizier and Chief of the town (i.e. mayor) during the 13th Dynasty, likely under pharaohs Wahibre Ibiaw and/or Merneferre Ay. Attestations There are no monuments which directly represent him, but he is mentioned as a vizier on three objects: a stele found at Deir el-Bahari and now exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (22.3.307), another stele found inside the sanctuary of Heqaib at Elephantine,Habachi, Elephantine IV, The Sanctuary of Heqaib, Mainz am Rhein 1985, , pl. 117a and a statuette probably from the Temple of Osiris at Abydos and now in Bologna (KS 1839). By combining the three monuments, egyptologists were able to realize a genealogy for Ibiaw: Some other monuments datable to this period refer to one or more dignitaries called Ibiaw. Some egyptologists believe that those objects could refer to the namesake vizier in some earlier stages of his career. Such statements would expand Ibiaw's genealogy: *One of the two sons of Ibiaw may have been the vizier Senebhenaf, father of queen Mentuhotep, herself wife of king Djehuti. This association could establish a significant temporal link between kings Ibiaw and Ay of the mid to late 13th dynasty and this poorly attested ruler.Habachi (1984) pp. 119-120.K.S.B. Ryholt, The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period (Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications, vol. 20. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1997), p. 192. *Ibiaw's father may have been the vizier Sobka called Bebi. *It has even been suggested that vizier Ibiaw later in his life became the namesake king (i.e. Wahibre Ibiaw).William C. Hayes, in The Cambridge Ancient History, 1973, vol. II, part I, p. 51ff. However, Wolfram Grajetzki later pointed out that, since there is no monument citing with certainty some of Ibiaw's earlier titles, such identifications are purely conjectural and remain unproven.W.

Family  Beatrice Caterina Enrichetta Ancillotti Goretti was born in Florence in 1879 into a family of impassioned liberals. Her maternal grandfather Demetrio Corgialegno (1785‚Äì1861), who had settled in Florence, came from an old and rich Byzantine noble family. He fought alongside the poet, Lord George Byron, during the Greek war of independence. He established a secret organisation aimed at overthrowing Ottoman rule based in both Corfu and his home town, Argostoli. Later, between 1838 and 1842, owing to his Tuscan connections, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Leopoldo II, gifted to him large quantities of books for the newly founded University of Athens. In 1871 Goretti's future father, Torello Ancillotti (1843‚Äì1899) married her mother Marianna Coriaglegno, known in the family as Demetria or Memi, with whom he would have two other children, Luisa, who died aged nine, and Demetrio apart from Beatrice. Torello Ancillotti had met his wife through his friend and the son of Demetrio Corgialegno, Carlo, when, in 1859, they had both joined Giuseppe Garibaldi during Italy's Third War of Independence. Awarded a silver medal for bravery during the conflict, when he returned to Florence, he was employed by the National Library of Florence. As a youth, he had studied at both the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze and that of Siena. He continued to paint, influenced greatly by the Macchiaioli, and in 1876 and 1877 held exhibitions in both Genoa and Turin. Leaving his family behind in Florence, in 1877, Torello Ancillotti moved to Rouen in France where, during a liaison with the Countess of Barr, he began an intense and successful period of artistic activity as a painter, water colourist and sculptor. Relationship with painter Giovanni Costetti Following in her father's footsteps, Goretti attended the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence before taking advanced classes at Giovanni Fattori's Free School of the Nude. It was there that she probably met and started a love affair with fellow student and artist, Giovanni Costetti (1878‚Äì1949). He painted a portrait of her entitled The Good Smile found in the Modern Art Gallery of the Pitti Palace in Florence. In 1899, she also painted a portrait of him that hangs in the same gallery. In 1901, both artists took part in the 1901 Alinari Divine Comedy Competition, which involved preparing new illustrations for Dante's epic poem The Divine Comedy. In 1903 Cosetti challenged a rival artist, Augusto Mussini (1870‚Äì1919) to a duel because he had become infatuated with Goretti. When Mussini disappeared from the city, he was feared dead. Instead, he had escaped from Florence to take refuge in a monastery in the north of Italy where he became a monk, although he never pronounced his final vows. That same year, Costetti reported two of Goretti's aunts to the police accusing them of keeping her a recluse. Before leaving Florence after she had ended the affair, she made a statement before a public notary in which she said she had, of her own free will, refused to marry Costetti and strongly denied the rumor that she had been forced into seclusion by her relatives declaring \\"I am an adult and no one can impose their will on me\\". Artistic legacy Following her departure from Florence, she settled at Stellata, in the province of Ferrara. Here she met Andrea Goretti, whom she married in Fiesole soon after, on 22 February 1904. This was the same year she painted her Self Portrait which is amongst the 170 watercolors, pastels, and pencil drawings bequeathed by her only daughter Maria Sara GorettiGoretti, comune.bologna.it, Retrieved 2016 to the Modern Art Collection. Additional vocations During World War I she worked as a nurse tending the wounded and the dying; that in 1925, she became a Quaker entering the Society of Friends of London; and that, in 1932, she was a registered member of the Italian Trade Union of Women Professional Artists. In 1937 Goretti, aged 58, died in Pistoia, a town about 35 kilometers north west of Florence.

Edwin Sr. was successful at turning the company around, and later purchased the company from the creditors, then changing the name to the Link Piano Company. For a period of time, the business primarily focused on making player pianos and orchestrions. The Star Theater, which was the oldest movie house in Binghamton, was the first to use the Link automatic piano to provide music for its silent films. As larger and more elaborate movie theatres were built, and more versatile organs were demanded, the company began manufacturing theatre pipe organs. At this time, the company's name was expanded to the Link Piano and Organ Company. The company produced about 130 theatre organs, before going out of business around 1932. Ed Link, Jr used the bellows technology from the automatic piano in his Link Trainer flight simulators.

A very low budget effort, the car reused the 2.1-litre turbocharged straight-four engine from Toyota's Group C cars, and was intended as an experimental car. It never raced, although it was tested on at least three occasions. Design and development In 1996, Toyota Motor Sports funded the development of an experimental Le Mans Prototype, which was officially known as the TOM'S Toyota LMP. As Toyota were primarily focusing on their Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) engine, which first ran that year, the LMP project was run on a tight budget of approximately $500,000. Due to this tight budget, the car, christened the \\"Lumpy\\", reused Toyota's 3S-GT engine in the 88C Group C specification, which was a 2.1-litre turbocharged straight- four engine, producing ; this engine was coupled to an Xtrac gearbox from a Peugeot Group C car. The chassis tub was designed to be simple but strong, and the bodywork was also simple; the tight budget meant that the LMP never saw a wind tunnel. The bodywork was designed to minimize lift over the upper body of the car, and had much simpler brake cooling than on most Le Mans Prototypes; the radiator ducts were used, via a scoop, to cool the brakes. After the LMP was completed, Tom Kristensen tested it on at least one occasion, whilst project director Andy Thorby recalled it being tested a total of three times; he stated that the car was very reliable, had lower fuel consumption than the 88C Group C car had (with the same engine), and that it also appeared to be quick. Following the completion of the tests, the car was dispatched to Toyota Team Europe's Cologne workshop, stored under a tarpaulin and eventually destroyed. Toyota would return to sportscar racing in 1998, with the Andr√© de Cortanze-designed Toyota GT-One.

Plot A family of three moves to a housing complex currently under construction. The father parks their car on an empty space with an out-of-order sign in a nearby underground parking lot. During their visit to the construction site, a loose metal falls and crushes them. The film cuts to a group of friends who is about to watch a new film in a cinema. Interspersed with it is Lisa, an office worker who works at the office where the previous parking lot is located, going to work with her lover. The parking lot is managed by two security guards: the older, cowardly, and perverted Baozi and the younger, recently inducted, and superstitious Luokun. The two are warned not to remove the out- of-order sign because of the presence of a \\"ghost\\", though only Luokun really takes this seriously. Lisa frequently has problems with starting her car in the parking lot and feels haunted by the ghosts of a young girl dressed in red and a white-clothed figure. During one such problem, Baozi checks through the lot further and comes into a dilapidated room. Upon encountering a pale woman and the girl, he suffers a heart attack and dies. His position is replaced by Shenyang, an even younger and naive individual. Meanwhile, Lisa and her lover encounter the woman and the girl during one night with Lisa's lover leaving her to her fate. She is saved by Luokun, who fends off with his spiritual experience. Lisa then gets a call informing her that her lover is killed in a car accident. Enough with her experiences, Lisa decides to transfer to the company's branch in Hong Kong. She gives her car key to the guards upon being informed that parking near the sidewalk is forbidden, but to her horror finds out that her car is parked back at the underground parking lot. Escorted by Luokun, she is able to drive away but her car stops just as she is about to get outside. While waiting in the security room, she discovers wigs and a white dress, realizing that Luokun is pretending to be the ghost. He goes up and chains her to a bed, revealing their previous relationship at a hotel which Lisa has long since forgotten, saying that he will take revenge at her for abandoning and humiliating him. After Luokun fends off the woman and girl ghosts (revealed to be the mother and daughter killed in the prologue) and delivering them to their relatives, he has a cat-and-mouse chase with Lisa and manages to tie her back, but Shenyang arrives and has a deadly fight with Luokun in which he dies, giving Lisa time to escape. Lisa and Luokun continue their chase above until Luokun abruptly gets hit by a car. It is revealed that most of the film's plot about Lisa and the security guards is a film within a film watched by the three friends introduced in the film's opening. Deciding that the film is mediocre, the three take their leave from the underground parking lot (in exactly the same place notified with the out-of-order sign) and go home, but are involved in a horrific car accident in which one of them has his head sliced off, while the other has his feet blown up and eventually crushed by an exploding manhole cover.

Sir Henry Parkes laid its foundation stone in 1890 when Paddington was a separate municipality. It was designed by John Edward Kemp and built from 1890 to 1891, and remains a distinctive example of Victorian architecture in Sydney. The clock tower, completed in 1905, is high and is a prominent landmark on the ridge of Oxford Street. It is also known as Town Hall and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =History of the area= This suburb, which took its name from the London borough, lies in what were once paddocks adjacent to Victoria Barracks. It was the first of the early Sydney suburbs that was not self-sufficient - its inhabitants, unlike those of Balmain or Newtown, where work was available in local industries, had to go away each day to their places of employment. Development of the eastern suburbs of Edgecliff, Double Bay, Point Piper and Woollahra surrounded this area with wealthy people's homes so this small hilly suburb lost all hope of harbour views. The area developed after a road was constructed to link up with a pilot station that was to be built at Watson's Bay (South Head Road). John Palmer, the settlement's commissary, refused to allow people to cross his land grant ('Woolloomooloo'), so the road had to follow a roundabout way through Paddington to bypass his . Only a handful of workers lived in the area, and it was not until 1838, when it was decided to build a new military barracks in Paddington, that life came to the area. From 1848 when Victoria Barracks had been opened (designed by Lt.-Col. George Barney) and homes for the soldiers and their families had been erected, Paddington began to assume a real identity...The (barracks site) land was sandy - in fact a huge sandhill was located on the western side of the Greens Road area, and the foundation trenches had to be dug very deep, to locate firm stone for the foundations. Stone was mostly quarried in the area: the stonemasons were free settlers who had worked on erection of the Customs House at what was then Semi-Circular Quay. Once the soldiers and their families moved here, shopkeepers followed. Builders moved into the area and put up 3,800 houses between 1860 and 1890. These terraces give today's Paddington its air of individuality. The first school in the area was opened in the Presbyterian manse in Oxford Street, built in 1845. It is hard to imagine that in 1822 the mansion Juniper Hall (the opposite southern corner of Oxford Street from the Reservoir site) stood alone, without the many neighbours it has today. Set in a flagged garden, it had attic windows that gave panoramic views to Rushcutters Bay and Botany Bay. Juniper Hall was built for Robert Cooper, distiller and emancipist merchant, who with partners James Underwood and Francis Ewen Forbes, had received from Governor Brisbane in , covering the whole of north Paddington, and they agreed to erect three mansions and a distillery there. A distillery was built at the foot of Cascade Street near Taylor Square and Cooper bought out his partners, and only Juniper Hall was erected. The Coopers were part of the social scene of their day and entertained many notables of that time. After they left the house it was renamed Ormond House to dissociate itself from the gin image and passed through many hands, gradually becoming smothered by the building of small shops in front of the house. Latterly it has been restored by the National Trust and has had a variety of uses. Today few of the area's original working class residents remain, as the suburb's proximity to the city has made it popular with business and professional people who prefer inner-city living in this historic area. The shopping centre, concentrated on the north side of Oxford Street, has also changed from one serving local needs to one of cafes, speciality shops and boutiques. Much of this is related to the changing population and the Village Bazaar, or Paddington Markets. The bazaar, which has operated since the mid 1970s, draws visitors from all over the city and has contributed to Paddington's development as one of Sydney's favourite tourist spots, along with Bondi Beach and The Rocks.Pollen, 1988, 195-7 =Paddington Council= The residents of Paddington raised a petition of 172 signatures in September 1859 requesting incorporation as a district. The proposed boundary was the Sydney Common to the south and New South Head Road to the north. The area was said to include 1,000 houses with 3,000 residents. The Council held their first meeting on 25 May 1860 with nine councillors and a Chairman. The first three meetings were held in the Paddington Inn before Council resolved to rent Mr. Logan's house next door for 12 months at 15 shillings a week. Meetings continued to be held at the house until the first Town Hall was built on the current site of the Royal Women's Hospital in Oxford Street in 1866. With a budget of the Council concentrated on maintaining roads, including kerbing and guttering, and erecting gas lamps. By 1867 Paddington had sufficient population to be elevated to a Borough and the Chairman became a Mayor. Paddington continued to prosper and in 1890 was receiving revenue second only to Balmain Council. Fifty years from its inception, in 1909, the population had risen to 26,000 in 4,800 houses and expenditure was at . During the 1890s depression and difficult years of the early 20th century Paddington declined and was characterised as a slum. In 1949 Paddington Council was subsumed by the City of Sydney. The last remnants of Paddington Council were removed in 1967 when the original boundary was divided between the Municipality of Woollahra and the City of Sydney. =Paddington Town Hall= Aspiring Town Clerk C. Hellmrich obtained the land for the Paddington Town Hall and argued for a new Hall on the site. The design was the subject of an international architectural competition with thirty submissions. Although a design specification was that the building could be constructed for 9000 pounds, none of the submissions were likely to meet this criteria. John Edward Kemp was the winner with an Italian Renaissance style building. Tenders confirmed that the scheme could not be built for 9000 pounds and estimates instead stood at 13,500 pounds. A loan was obtained from an overseas institution to allow construction. Situated at the highest point on the Oxford Street ridge, the town hall's foundation stone was laid on 8 November 1890 by Sir Henry Parkes and was opened with great fanfare on 3 October 1891 by the Governor, The Earl of Jersey. The first major alteration to the Town Hall occurred in 1904‚Äì1905, when the clock tower was erected in commemoration of the coronation of King Edward VII. The face of the clock is inscribed with \\"Edwardus VII\\". The honour to King Edward was that Paddington was, at the time, a large town hall, second only to Sydney. The Town Hall varied slightly from the majority of town halls in that it was intended from the beginning to generate income from the hiring of the supper and ball room for balls, dances, concerts and public ceremonies. Again, Paddington was second only to Sydney in its importance and capacity, seating 1000 people. The Town Hall included specifically designed lodge rooms for the Paddington Ionic Masonic Lodge, which Council leased to them until 1918, when a rent raise caused the Lodge to vacate their room. Paddington Town Hall was the site of a meeting of Rugby League players in 1908, at which the Eastern Suburbs Rugby League club, now the Sydney Roosters, was officially formed. On 10 September 1969, the congress of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) was held at the town hall, with Bob Hawke being elected as the new president. The original design also included a library. During 50th celebrations the Council boasted that the library was the best free library outside of Sydney. The collection contained 4000 books, the reading room could seat 30 people and, in comparison to other libraries, was well used. The library was relocated in 1977 from Oatley Road to beneath the Main Hall on Oxford Street as part of a financial package to reinvigorate the Town Hall. The City of Sydney, the Australia Council and the Australian Film Commission provided $500,000 to redevelop the Town Hall as a centre that included an exhibition space, restaurant and an adjacent cinema. The building now houses radio studios, Paddington Library, and is a venue for private functions. The Chauvel Cinema (part of the Palace Films and Cinemas chain) has been operating in the Town Hall since 1977, inside the former Town Hall ballroom (the original floor and ceiling were retained).  Description  =External description= The Paddington Town Hall is two storeys, built of brick and finished with render. The overall architectural style is Victorian Free Classical.Apperly, Irving & Reynolds 1989: 56-59 The principle decorative elements are \\"an open colonnade to Oxford Street and rows of Roman-arched first-floor windows flanked by Corinthian pilasters and a balustered parapet\\".National Estate Register The main entrance was once off Oxford Street and is marked by a projected pediment and parapet (removed). Oxford Street is the more ornate of the two facades reflecting its more prominent position. The clock tower is located on the corner of Oxford Street and Oatley Road. As with the facades, the main decorative form is Corinthian pilasters, pairs of which support the clock. Doric columns and a pediment frame the clock. The tower is finished with a dome supported by an octagonal drum. The Oxford Street facade is slightly different to the Oatley Road face. On Oatley Street the windows are spaced further apart and the ground level lacks the colonnades. The southern end of the facade is a later addition, its arched entry and open balcony closely match the original section. The southern end was further modified with the construction of the cinema in 1977, when the first floor windows were blocked off. Unsympathetic modifications were made to the ground floor in 1951. Clock tower The Town Hall has a high clock tower, completed in 1905 to commemorate the coronation of Edward VII, that dominates the Paddington skyline. Whilst the eastern, southern, and western faces of the clock display the conventional Roman clock-face numerals, the Roman numerals on the northern (Oxford Street) side of the clock have been replaced as follows: 1:D, 2:U, 3:S, 4:T, 5:H, 6:E, 7:VII, 8:E, 9:D, 10:V, 11:A, 12:R. This was done to celebrate the coronation of King Edward VII; and, commencing at where the VIII ought to be, the northern clock-face reads E.D.V.A.R.D.U.S. T.H.E. VII. The clock was officially set in motion on 30 August 1905, by Joseph Carruthers, the Premier of New South Wales, who noted that he \\"thought that the day on which peace had been declared between Russia and Japan was a fitting time to set it in motion\\" and that \\"he hoped there would be peace and goodwill on earth as long as the clock continued to go\\". =Internal description= The main vestibule can be entered from both Oxford Street and Oatley Road and the internal decoration continues to utilise ornamented archways to harmonise with the exterior. The ceiling is of pressed metal, while the floor of ceramic tiles is arranged in a geometric star pattern. The Main Hall is located on the first floor. The hall was significantly altered in 1933‚Äì1934 and re-decorated in an Art Deco style. The coffered ceiling was retained, but much of the original plasterwork has been removed - replaced with open grille work matching those cut in the wall. The walls are punctuated with projecting cylindrical plaster columns, capped with floral capitals. Extending north of the hall is a narrow hall-like space that was originally an open loggia defined by Corinthian piers. Hall No. 2 has been converted into a cinema, destroying much of the interior space. The ante-chamber to the hall has been removed to create the cinema foyer. The ground floor on Oxford Street was originally the council offices and the Council Chambers, but is now a library. The entry remains reasonably intact, with similar details to the principle entrance. Conversion into a library significantly altered the layout with the insertion of unsympathetic arches to allow access.

The name yeye derives from the Beatles lyrical verse, \\"yeah, yeah, yeah\\", which took off in the United States and was listened to by upper class Haitian families who had access to the radio. Young Haitians formed small electric guitar-based bands. These yeye rock bands were short-lived, as the addition of compas to their repertoires resulted in a sound was called mini-jazz, or mini-djaz in Haitian Creole. Today, Rock Krey√≤l is an alternative rock music with a blend of Caribbean flavor that was first introduced to Haiti by Yohann Dor√©.

Edward King Fordham Career and the Royston Bank The second son of Edward Fordham (1721‚Äì1778) of Therfield in Hertfordshire and his wife Mary Carter (1722‚Äì1798)\\"England Marriages, 1538‚Äì1973\\" database, FamilySearch(https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NNDL-HXG : accessed 1 October 2015), Edward Fordam and Mary Carter, 31 Jan 1744; citing Caxton, Cambridge, England, reference 1744; FHL microfilm 1,818,420 he moved to Royston, the nearby town, while still a young man. In early life he worked as a woolcomber and stapler. He became prominent in business there, and a founder of the Royston Bank.Alan R. Ruston, Unitarianism in Hertfordshire (PDF) , at p. 17. Cancelled banknote from the Royston Bank, 1853 The Royston Bank was set up in 1808, and traded under the name of Fordham, Flower & Co. In 1825 control passed within the Fordham family to John Edward Fordham (1799‚Äì1881), a nephew of Edward King Fordham, with John George Fordham (1780‚Äì1877), another nephew; John Edward ran the bank, then known as John Fordham & Co. The Royston Bank, then Fordham & Co., lost its independence in 1896 with the merger of a dozen banks to form Barclay & Co. The Fordhams as brewers The family concern was brewing. Peter Mathias considers the practical operation of duties on maltsters and brewers made a step into finance, from retaining duty on malt, a natural one; though the Fordham family was one of only a handful who made it. Fordham's father Edward was in that business at Ashwell. It was however another Edward King Fordham (1810‚Äì1889) who in 1839 constructed a larger brewery at Ashwell. He was in partnership with his brother Oswald. He then built it up, attaching many pubs as tied houses, and it became the largest brewery in the area. It was sold to the Luton brewer J.W Green in 1953. The Fordhams and Hertfordshire politics The younger George Fordham, a nephew of Edward King Fordham, was a follower of William Cobbett. In early 1822 a meeting was held to consider rural distress, and participants included Thomas Brand, 20th Baron Dacre, a Hertfordshire Whig MP to 1819, and William Lamb, then sitting as MP. In bitter exchanges, George Fordham required Lamb to strengthen a reform petition proposed by Dacre, by an amendment; Lamb declined to be instructed; and George's brother Edward made an ad hominem attack on Lamb. Sir John Sebright, the other sitting MP, also refused to be treated as a delegate. Edward King Fordham intervened, explaining that he concurred with the amendment, but also with Dacre's view that it should be withdrawn. He took the same line that his nephews as extreme reformers were being divisive at a meeting in 1823.historyofparliamentonline.org, Hertfordshire, 1820‚Äì1832. Associations From 1833 to shortly after Fordham's death, the minister at Royston's Unitarian chapel was Archibald Forbes Macdonald (1808‚Äì1886). Ruston believes that, almost certainly, Fordham was his major source of income.Alan R. Ruston, Unitarianism in Hertfordshire (PDF) , at pp. 19‚Äì20. He was later known as an \\"advanced Radical\\". Family Fordham was married in 1785, to Sarah Chantry (1756-1823), but died without surviving issue. A marble tablet to them was placed in Kelshall church.Antiquary, a magazine devoted to the study of the past vol. 46 (1905), p. 224; archive.org. With his brother George (1752-1840), Fordham bought the Odsey estate from William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, in 1793. There were two other brothers, Elias (1762-1838) who became a Unitarian minister, and John (1747-1830); Elias Pym Fordham was the son of Elias Fordham and his wife Ann Clapton. Fordham also bought property at Sandon, Hertfordshire, some acquired via Elias. Fordham's sister Elizabeth (1765-1846) married Richard Flower the brewer, brother of Benjamin Flower. Edward Fordham Flower was therefore Edward King Fordham's nephew. The younger Edward King Fordham of the later 19th century was a great-nephew.

In 1845, motivated by the fashion of the time for bourgeois interior ornamentation, Charles Biva opened a wallpaper factory in a northern suburb of Paris where his sons Henri and Paul began their apprenticeship as designers and colorists.

His father was a well-known painter,Janet Whitmore, Ph.D., a biography of Henri Biva and it may have been difficult for Lucien Biva to make a name for himself without being linked to the work of his father. In the press chroniclers speak of \\"the Biva's\\" assimilating the son behind the father, and tended to write of the Biva brothers, confusing in a single work that of Henri and Paul Biva. In 1903, the Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© des amis des arts du d√©partement de l'EureSoci√©t√© des amis des arts du d√©partement de l'Eure, Bulletin XIX, 1903, periodiques, Gallica Henry Chantraine evokes the Exposition des beaux-arts d‚ÄôEvreux: \\"Passing in front of the Dahlias with its rich impasto and the Village, with violent tones, but already much more moderate [than those of Lucien Lamarre, mentioned above by the columnist] of MM. Henri and Lucien Biva [...].\\" Lucien Biva, Bouquet de Rose, oil on canvas, 61 x 51 cm Lucien Biva's family nicknamed him \\"the anarchist\\", perhaps because he rejected part of the family pictorial legacy. In New York, when he exhibited at the Sixth Annual Exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists,Catalogue of the Sixth Annual exhibition of The Society of Independent Artists: no jury, no prizes\\" The Waldorf Astoria, New York, 11 March ‚Äì 2 April 1922 he was cited with other artists in the columns of New York Times (10 March 1922) as \\"stamped all over with the stamp of independence\\". It may be noted that the statement of the chronicler was somewhat tinged with irony. Since Society of Independent Artists created in 1916 was modeled after Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants created in Paris in 1884, the author seems to have suggested this \\"independent\\" movement was already classical. Other family reasons probably contributed to his departure for the States in 1919, at the age of 41. World War I had just ended, but his younger brother, jewelry designer Marius Biva, also formed at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des arts d√©coratifs, died at Verdun in 1915 at the age of 25 years. =American nationality= Lucien Biva became an American citizen in 1928, residing mostly in New York City, Brooklyn, Queens, White Plains and Catskill. He painted and exhibited throughout the second leg of his career in the United States. =Design= Between 1921 and 1949 Biva patented ornamental designs for textile fabrics and other articles of manufacture having surface ornamentation, patenting over eighty designs with the United States Patent Office. At least one of Biva's designs, U.S. patent 59.177 of 1921, inspired other patents, such as U.S. patent 5,445,863, of 1995, used in clothing and other camouflage material for activities such as hunting and military maneuvers.Camouflage material, US 5445863 A Lucien Biva, Apr√®s-midi, Villeneuve l'Etang, Salon 1912 postcard.

But when he left France in 1919, other artistic influences infused his style‚ÄîLes Nabis, Art Nouveau and Fauvism‚Äîinfluences left over from his associations with artists at the Salon des Ind√©pendants.Albany Institute of History and Art, 5‚Äì24 November 1957 With realism in his past, Biva's new work consisted of colorful landscapes, with certain titles of his paintings emphasizing the primacy given to colors. Lucein Biva's work was shown in New York in the form of a retrospective exhibition, November 1957, at the Albany Institute of History & Art Early works painted in France were juxtaposed with contemporary works painted in the United States, depicting a variety of places and subjects. He died in New York, aged 87.

Urania's Mirror; or, a view of the Heavens is a set of 32 astronomical star chart cards, first published in November 1824. They are illustrations based on Alexander Jamieson's A Celestial Atlas, but the addition of holes punched in them allow them to be held up to a light to see a depiction of the constellation's stars. See also :File:Advertisement for Urania's Mirror.png. They were engraved by Sidney Hall, and were said to be designed by \\"a lady\\", but have since been identified as the work of the Reverend Richard Rouse Bloxam, an assistant master at Rugby School. p. 239 The cover of the box-set depicts Urania, the muse of astronomy. It originally came with a book entitled A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy... written as an accompaniment. Peter Hingley, the researcher who solved the mystery of who designed the cards a hundred and seventy years after their publication, considered them amongst the most attractive star chart cards of the many produced in the early 19th century. Description A high- resolution scan of the front box of \\"Urania's Mirror\\" (First edition). Urania's Mirror illustrates 79 constellations on 32 separate cards. Some of the illustrated constellations are now obsolete, as are some of the subconstellations, such as Caput Medus√¶ (the head of Medusa, carried by Perseus). Urania's Mirror was originally advertised as including \\"all the constellations visible in the British Empire\\", but, in fact, it left out some southern constellations. By the second edition (1825), advertisements merely claimed illustration of the constellations visible from \\"Great Britain\\". Some cards focus on a single constellation, others include several, with Card 32, centered on Hydra, illustrating twelve constellations (several of which are no longer recognised). Card 28 has six, and no other card has more than four. Each card measures 8 inches by (about 20 by 14 cm). A book by Jehoshaphat Aspin entitled A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy (or, to give its full name, A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy, Explaining the General Phenomena of the Celestial Bodies; with Numerous Graphical Illustrations) was written to accompany the cards. The cards and book came in a box illustrated with a woman almost certainly intended to be Urania, muse of astronomy. The cards and book were originally published by Samuel Leigh, 18 Strand, London, p. 238 although, by the fourth edition, the publishing firm had moved to 421 Strand and changed its name to M. A. Leigh. p. 239 (illus.) P.D. Hingley calls Urania's Mirror \\"one of the most charming and visually attractive of the many aids to astronomical self-instruction produced in the early nineteenth century\\". On its main gimmick, the holes in the stars meant to show the constellation when held in front of a light, he notes that, as the size of the holes marked correspond to the magnitude of the stars, a quite realistic depiction of the constellation is provided. Ian Ridpath mostly concurs. He describes the device as an \\"attractive feature\\", but notes that, due to the light at the time being provided primarily by candles, many cards likely burned up due to carelessness when trying to hold them in front of the flame. He notes three other attempts to use the same gimmick‚ÄîFranz Niklaus K√∂nig's Atlas c√©leste (1826), Friedrich Braun's Himmels-Atlas in transparenten Karten (1850), and Otto M√∂llinger's Himmelsatlas (1851), but states that they lack Urania's Mirror's artistry. Copying from A Celestial Atlas File:Alexander Jamieson Celestial Atlas- Plate 7 - restoration - crop.jpgA Celestial Atlas, Plate 7 File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Bootes, Canes Venatici, Coma Berenices, and Quadrans Muralis.jpgUrania's Mirror, Plate 10 The depictions of the constellations in Urania's Mirror are redrawings from those in Alexander Jamieson's A Celestial Atlas, published about three years earlier, and include unique attributes differing from Jamieson's sky atlas, including the new constellation of Noctua the owl, and \\"Norma Nilotica\\" ‚Äì a measuring device for the Nile floods ‚Äì held by Aquarius the water bearer. Mystery of the designer, and solution Advertisements for Urania's Mirror, as well as the introduction to its companion book A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy, credit the design of the cards simply to a \\"lady\\", who is described in the introduction of the book as being \\"young\\". This led to speculation as to her identity. Some proposed prominent female astronomers such as Caroline Herschel and Mary Somerville, others credited the engraver Sidney Hall. The designer's identity remained unknown for 170 years. In 1994, while archiving early election certificates used to propose people to be admitted to the Royal Astronomical Society, P. D. Hingley found one proposing the Reverend Richard Rouse Bloxam and naming him as \\"Author of Urania's Mirror\\". While he had several notable sons, he has no other known publications, his main distinction being to have served as assistant master at Rugby School for 38 years. The reasons for the disguise are unknown. Hingley notes that many contemporary publications attempted to suggest women had played a role in their creation, perhaps to make them sound less threatening. He suggests that anonymity might have been necessary to protect Bloxam's position at Rugby, but notes Rugby was quite progressive, which makes this unlikely; and, finally, suggests modesty as a possibility. p. 240 Ian Ridpath, noting the plagiarism of the art from A Celestial Atlas, suggests that this alone might be sufficient to cause the author to wish to remain anonymous. Editions File:Aspin-1825-Pisces.jpgFirst edition \\"Pisces\\", without stars in the surrounding constellations. \\"Plain\\". File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Pisces.jpgSecond edition \\"Pisces\\", with the surrounding stars. \\"Fully coloured\\". A December 1824 advertisement, which states the cards were \\"just published\\", offered the cards \\"plain\\" at ¬£1/8s or \\"fully coloured\\" for ¬£1/14s. This first edition did not include any stars surrounding the named constellations, leaving those parts blank. This was changed for the second edition, which added back stars around those constellations. An American edition was published in 1832. Modern reprints were produced in 1993, and Barnes & Noble reproduced the American edition (with accompanying book) in 2004. The accompanying book, A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy by Jehoshaphat Aspin went through at least four editions, with the last coming out in 1834. The second edition featured a marked expansion in content, growing from 121 pages in the first edition to 200 pages in the second. The book, by the time of the 1834 American edition, consisted of an introduction, a list of the northern and southern constellations, a description of each of the plates, with the history and background of the constellations depicted, and an alphabetical list of named stars (such as Achernar) with their Bayer designation, magnitude, and respective constellation.Taken from the reproduction of the book included in the 2004 Barnes and Noble facsimile edition of the Urania's Mirror set. A \\"Second Part\\" of Urania's Mirror, which was to have included illustrations of the planets and a portable orrery, was advertised, but no evidence exists to show it was ever released.

Life Karl Gunnar Persson was born in Bor√•s, Sweden, then a textile industry centre, and was educated as an economic historian at Lund University. In the 1960s and 1970s he mostly worked as a freelance journalist for the Swedish Radio, journals and newspapers. Persson‚Äôs early academic work was in sociometrics investigating social mobility. He returned to economic history in the early 1980s. He spent most of his career at the Department of Economics, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. He began as a Senior Lecturer in 1975 and later became Reader and finally Professor. He was appointed Professor Emeritus in 2013. He has been a visiting scholar at various universities such as London School of Economics, European University Institute and Australian National University. Karl Gunnar Persson has had various administrative duties at his Department over the years, including that of Deputy Head of Department. He has been the founding president of the European Historical Economics SocietyHistorical Economics Society webpage and one of the founding editors of the European Review of Economic History.European Review of Economic History webpage He is a fellow of the Royal Danish Academy. He died in Siena, Italy on 14 September 2016. Work =Pre-Industrial Economic Growth= In the monograph Pre-Industrial Economic Growth Pre-Industrial Economic Growth, Social Organization and Technological Progress in Europe, Basil Blackwell, Oxford 1988 he showed that the traditional Malthusian model did not have a single equilibrium characterized by subsistence income, but in fact a number of equilibria. If slow but persistent technological progress was admitted in a Malthus-Ricardo model, the equilibrium was characterized by positive population growth and income above subsistence. The level of per capita income and the rate of population growth was determined by the rate of technological progress given the rate of diminishing returns to labour. The problem with estimating growth and income levels in pre-industrial societies is the lack of precise national income data. His approach is based on indirect estimates and relies on the possibility of inferring growth in per capita income by using data on changes in the occupational pattern and by implication the consumption pattern. The method uses Engel‚Äôs law, the idea that households spend an increasing share of an income increase on non-food items and consequently less of the income increase on food. That will affect production and occupational distribution away from food production. An increase in the share of non-food producers in an economy reveals a per capita income increase. Using the method with relevant controls indicate pre-industrial income growth since Medieval times of around 0.15‚Äì0.25 per cent per year. =Market integration= In the 1990s Persson was mainly working with the analysis of market integration arguing that markets which had stochastic output shocks, like grain production, experienced a stabilization of prices when previously segmented markets were integrated. The reason was that trade dampened the local shocks since over a large area shocks were independent geographically: grain could flow from surplus to deficient areas. This strand of research was summarized in his monograph Grain markets in Europe 1500‚Äì1900.Grain markets in Europe 1500-1900, Integration and Deregulation, Cambridge University Press, 1999 =The law of one price= In subsequent work in this field Persson has investigated the operation of the law of one price, the idea that price differentials for a homogenous good traded between two locations must equal the transport costs between the two markets. He found that the quality and speed of information transmission determined the deviations from the ‚Äòlaw of one price‚Äô and that the introduction of the telegraph and the commercial press greatly reduced the deviations and increased the speed by which the ‚Äòlaw of one price‚Äô was restored after a shock in one market. He has also measured the costs, in terms of dead weight loss, of poor market integration and the subsequent welfare gains of improvements in market performance. =An Economic History of Europe= Persson has been teaching economic history for economics students during four decades and these lectures were reworked to a general textbook published as An Economic History of Europe.An Economic History of Europe, Knowledge, Institutions and Growth, 600 to the Present, Cambridge University Press, 2010. This treatise differs from traditional textbooks in economic history by not taking up a chronological narrative. Instead it is theme and problem-oriented with separate chapters on the international monetary order, inequality, institutions and growth, knowledge transmission and convergence, globalization and so forth. =Historical demography= Persson has been working with historical demography since his becoming an Emeritus professor. In particular he is investigating the mechanisms of within-marriage fertility control before the advent of modern means of contraception. Persson is challenging the conventional view in historical demography which tend to neglect within-marriage fertility control before the modern era. He is also involved in a project refining the method of productivity estimates by using occupational data.

Vetter.Weaver 2011, p. 18. The film stars Wayne Morris, Anton Diffring and Karin Booth.\\"History: 'The Crooked Sky'.\\" BFI, 2019. Retrieved: 12 August 2109. Plot American detective Mike Conlin (Wayne Morris), teams up with Scotland Yard to catch the villains behind a big counterfeiting ring. After the mysterious death of an American airline radio operator, the Yard suspect the operation may originate in the United States, and Conlin is brought over to help. In London, ¬£500,000 in counterfeit one-pound notes has been smuggled in by Tom Alanson (Guy Kingsley-Poynter), an American radio engineer for a freight line flying between England and the United States. He is in a gang of smugglers but goes to Scotland Yard but two gang members stab him to death. Yard Inspector \\"Mac\\" MacAuley (Bruce Seton) believes the forged notes come from the United States. Mac contacts the U.S. Treasury who assigns investigator Mike Conlin (Wayne Morris) to the case. Mike suspects Alanson's freight line were involved in smuggling the counterfeit currency, subsequently, he flies to London. Mike posing as an efficiency expert, he meets radio engineer Sandra Hastings (Karin Booth), Alanson's fianc√©e, and sister of Bill Hastings (Sheldon Lawrence), another radio operator. While searching woods near company headquarters, Mike witnesses the fatal shooting of another company employee. After revealing his true identity to the local police inspector, who has come to investigate the murder, Mike goes to London to consult with Mac and suggests that the fake currency might have been concealed in radio equipment removed after each flight. Later, at an illegal gambling club in London, Bill introduces Sandra to Frank Fraser (Anton Diffring), the club's operator and, unknown to her, the head of the counterfeit ring. In private, Bill, whose involvement in the ring was to earn money to start his own charter company, tells Fraser he is concerned about the recent murders. After a gambler named Smith (Reginald Hearne), heavy in debt to Fraser, commits suicide, some counterfeit notes are found, along with a list of gambling clubs. The police begin to investigate Fraser while Mike continues to look for evidence. Eventually, Bill warns Fraser about the new man, leading Fraser to assign two thugs to follow Mike. Sandra accuses Bill of being involved with Fraser's criminal activities. She also tells Mike about Fraser. Breaking intoFraser's house, Mike finds counterfeit pound notes in a desk drawer. Surprised by Fraser and his henchmen, Mike is taken to a wooded area to kill him, but Mike escapes. When Fraser's girl friend, Penny (Colette Bartrop), takes several bundles of counterfeit notes to buy an expensive necklace, the money is traced back to Fraser. With Mac's help, Mike makes plans to round up the entire gang, and when Bill returns from the U.S., has him followed to Fraser's house. After Bill informs Fraser that the notes are still on the aircraft, Fraser is tipped off by one of his thugs that a police raid is imminent. At gunpoint, Fraser orders Bill to take him to the air base and fly him out of the country. Upon learning that Bill did not take the notes to Fraser, Mike boards the aircraft to search for them. When Fraser and Bill arrive at the aircraft, Fraser shoots Mike in the shoulder, then orders Bill to fly to France, although Bill warns him that all airports will be closed to them. Strapping on a parachute, in which the gang has been smuggling the currency, Fraser plans to jump from the aircraft and escape, unaware that the parachute has been altered to accommodate more counterfeit notes. Bill puts the aircraft on automatic pilot, attacks Fraser who falls out of the aircraft, but his parachute fails to open and Fraser plummets to his death. Back on the ground, Mike assures Sandra and Bill that, due to Bill's actions in the air that day, it is unlikely that he will be prosecuted.

The app allows users to book a taxi and track it in real time. The same iOS, Android, or Windows Phone app can be used in all places in which the partner taxis operate. Easy Taxi was founded in 2011 in Brazil and has since expanded globally, covering the network of 30 countries and more than 420 cities. As of December 2014, the company reported it reached the number of 17 million users and more than 400,000 taxi drivers are affiliated with an Easy Taxi network. The startup is backed primarily by the biggest e-Commerce incubator in the world, Rocket Internet, but also other investors, including Millicom and iMENA secure Easy Taxi's foothold in emerging markets. The four latest series of investment took Easy Taxi to over $77 million in backing.https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/26/rocket-internets-easy-taxi- raises-40m-series-d-to-expand-in-asia-latin-america/  History  The original idea emerged in early 2011 from the founders, Tallis Gomes and Daniel Cohen. According to Gomes, the main trigger for starting the company was inefficiency of the taxi transportation he experienced in Rio de Janeiro during one of the startup events: > I was attending an event for start-ups in Leblon and I was waiting for a > taxi for about half an hour on a rainy night. At that time I was planning to > create a bus monitoring application, but I changed my mind and decided to > invest in this solution. The concept was first presented to the public during the Startup Weekend RIO 2011. After winning the entire competition, in the same year the company won Startup Farm Rio contest and entered the group of five finalists selected from scores of entrants in the IBM-backed SmartCamp competition. Together with other finalists, Easy Taxi was invited to the high-tech conference in Rio, which brought together business leaders and government officials interested in solving urban problems. The application was launched in beta version in August 2011, following two-month-long introductory phase. Daniel Cohen, Vinicius Gracia, Bernardo Bicalho, and Marcio William joined Gomes at company's early stages, forming its first team. Rio de Janeiro served as a test market for Easy Taxi, with an official launch of the app in April 2012. The initial business model was based on charging the driver R$2 per each completed ride. Within the first year of operations, the company managed to acquire more than 5000 drivers and 200,000 users. Upon entering S√£o Paulo, Alex Tabor, an angel investor from Peixe Urbano, supported the company with first major funding. The real turning point came with the first round of investment of $4.9 million from Rocket Internet in October 2012. The fresh inflow of funds allowed Easy Taxi to expand abroad to its first international market, Mexico. On 24 June 2013, Easy Taxi received Series B investment from Latin America Internet Holding (LIH) a joint venture between Rocket Internet and Millicom, securing another $15 million. At that time the company stated it had more than 1 million downloads and 30000 drivers in the network. The new funds were intended for international expansion in Asia and LATAM, improved customer service and new features. Following the capital injection, the company entered several new markets, including Malaysia (July 2013), Philippines and Thailand (August 2013), and Hong Kong. Another $10 million round of funding and a plan to tackle a new market ‚Äì Africa, were announced in July 2013. The joint venture responsible for the investment was Africa Internet Group, backed by Rocket Internet and its 35% owner, telecoms operator Millicom. In October 2013, Rocket Internet and iMENA Holding partnered together, launching the app in the Middle East and North Africa. The investment amounted to $7 million and was intended for the app's regional rollout, which started in Saudi Arabia. On launching in Nigeria, the company has also announced its plans to enter Ghana, Egypt, Morocco, Ivory Coast, and South Africa towards the end of 2013. The original concept of prioritizing markets that have urban mobility problems and experience inefficiency in their transportation systems still constitutes an integral part of the expansion strategy of Easy Taxi with nearly all of its markets belonging to the group of emerging economies. In 2017 Cabify bought Easy Taxi https://www.sunoresearch.com.br/noticias/cabify-incorporar-easy- taxi-aplicativo/. The app itself was incorporated into Cabify in 2019 and Easy Taxi was discontinuated.  Awards  The company won multiple awards as a pioneer in taxi call service in Latin America. This includes Startup Weekend RIO 2011, IBM SmartCamp Brazil 2011, Startup Farm RIO 2011 and TNW Brazil Awards. It was featured as Best App of 2014 in App Store and Google Play.  Social responsibility  Easy Taxi is supporting the social responsibility programs for the taxi industry worldwide. In Brazil it implemented a system of the so-called ‚ÄúBibliotaxis‚Äù, through which passengers can borrow books available inside Easy Taxi cabs, returning them on the next trip. In other Latin American countries it partnered with local bars and restaurants to promote the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt drink and drive campaign.‚Äù In the Philippines, in turn, the company implemented a series of education and physical training for the drivers, aiming at improving the image of the transportation industry in Manila and portray it as safe and efficient. Competitors There are several similar services including UnTaxi, Nekso, Auto Amigo., and Uber.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1980 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History In 1867, George and Amanda Hedden purchased of land that had previously been part of the nearby Old Mission, which had been abandoned in 1852. The Heddens constructed this 25-room inn on the property in 1874, and operated it as \\"Heddon Hall.\\" In the 1880s, the railroad and steamship lines service in the area began promoting the Grand Traverse region as a summer tourist destination, and the Old Mission Inn was recognized as one of the best hotels in the area. In 1890, the Heddens added a section onto the inn. The Heddens continued to run the inn until Amanda Hedden's death in 1900. In 1902, George Hedden sold the inn to Alfred and Ella Porter, who changed the name to the \\"Porter Hotel\\" and managed the property for 40 years. It was sold again in 1945 to Norman and Doris Nevinger, who named it the \\"Old Mission Inn.\\" The Nevingers ran the property until 1998, when they sold it to the Jensen family.

Lacons Brewery is in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England. In 2013, it produced 7,500 pints of beer a week. Lacons Brewery was founded in 1760, but shut down in 1968, before being relaunched in 2013.  History  The Lacon Arms, Hemsby In 1640, Jeffrey Ward operated as a brewer and a maltster in Church Plain, Great Yarmouth, on a site which was to become The Falcon Brewery. His son, who died in 1690, and his grandson Robert Ward, who died in 1741 managed the business in succession. Ward's widow took their son-in-law John Laycon in partnership. Lacon became the sole owner of the brewery on her death in 1760 and thus Lacons Brewery was formed. By the 1810s the business owned three maltings, two breweries and 45 tied houses in Great Yarmouth. In the 1850s, the brewery held fifty public houses and controlled over 300 pubs in Great Yarmouth. In 1814, Lacons supplied over 20,000 pints of beer to a festival dinner held in the town to celebrate the final defeat of Napoleon's France. In the mid 1800s Lacons Brewery decided to sell to the London market and by 1866 it was despatching upwards of 50,000 barrels yearly to London, 20,000 to other locations, as well as the local market. The brewery produced around 100,000 barrels of beer a year. In 1952, the directors of Lacons decided to float the company on the stock market and five years later sold 20% of the company to Whitbread. Whitbread bought Lacons for ¬£3.2 million in 1965 and in 1968, Whitbread decided to shut down the brewery. Whitbread's brands and trademarks were later taken over by Anheuser-Busch InBev and thus the Lacons trademark went to Anheuser-Busch InBev. Lacons deposited a sample of their brewing yeast in 1957 at the Norwich-based National Collection of Yeast Cultures, as a backup in case their own cultures got contaminated.  Reopening  Mick Carver of JV Trading, a drinks distributor based in Lowestoft, started working to secure the rights to the Lacons name in 2009. He negotiated with Anheuser- Busch InBev to secure the name and its intellectual property. He then decided on an old Victorian courtyard in Main Cross Road as the premises for the operations. He worked alongside William Lacon, son of the last Lacon family member to work at the brewery and sought assistance from David Lacon, an avid Lacons collector and nephew of Christopher Kevill Davis, the last CEO at Lacons. Yeast from the original beer was held in deep freeze at National Collection of Yeast Cultures. After obtaining the Lacons rights, Carver was able to claim the brewery's original yeast strains. The head brewer, Wil Wood, spent six months developing the reinvented ales. Carver employed a creative agency to rework the iconic emblem and logo of Lacons to capture how it would have evolved over the past 45 years if the brewery had not closed. The new Lacons‚Äô emblem depicts a falcon with its wings outspread and ready to land, which symbolises the return of Lacons. The brewery was relaunched at the Norwich City of Ale festival and Great Yarmouth Beer and Cider Festival in May 2013. In the initial phase of the operation, the brewery has planned to produce three new permanent beers both bottled and on tap as well as to introduce other seasonal beers. Three new permanent beers were launched: Encore, Legacy and Affinity. The company has extended the beer range to include some original Lacons recipes, in its heritage range. These beers are modern interpretations of historic recipes, dating back to 1905.

Although the area was settled early in Massachusetts history (c. 1637), the Winthrop peninsula remained sparsely populated until the 19th century. Its central area did not begin significant development until there was some industrial development in the first half of the 19th century, and accelerated with the arrival of the railroad later in the 19th century. It is centered on Metcalf Square, at the junction of Pauline, Hermon, and Winthrop Streets; the district extends northward along Hermon and Winthrop, and also includes properties as far east as Cross Street. Most of the over 100 buildings in the district are residential, and were built between about 1880 and 1940. The oldest house in the district is believed to be 257 Winthrop Street, which is thought to have been built in the 1790s and restyled with Greek Revival details in the 19th century. (This is in contrast to Winthrop's oldest house, the c. 1675 Deane Winthrop House, which lies outside the district.) The most prominent buildings are the cluster of municipal and religious buildings around Metcalf Square: the Town Hall (1929) and Library (1898) are both Renaissance Revival structures, while the police station (formerly a post office) is a Colonial Revival building from 1932, and the Methodist Church is a Colonial/Classical Revival from 1930. There are some fine examples of well-preserved 19th-century architectural styles in the district. Noteworthy Italianate houses include 11 George Street, whose gables are studded with decorative brackets indicative of the style, and 233 Winthrop Street, the city's only towered Italianate villa. Particularly good examples of Queen Styling are found at 180 and 272 Winthrop; the latter in particular is distinguished for its turret, which has a bulbous roof and carved wooden panel decorations.

George was born in Llangoedmor, near Cardigan, but moved at a young age to Pontseli, near Newcastle Emlyn. One of his contemporaries was Herber Evans, a prominent Calvinistic Methodist minister. He entered the drapery trade and spent a number of years in London. He married Rachel Rees, of Castell Gorwyn, Trelech, Carmarthenshire and they had a son and two daughters. The son became a mining engineer in India. In 1876, George moved to Trecynon where he opened a drapery business, and in 1886 he took over the larger concern of Henry Lewis, known as the Beehive, in Victoria Square, Aberdare. He retired from business in 1900. George became active in local Liberal politics, was a founder member of the Aberdare Liberal Club and was also active in the South Wales Liberal Association. In 1894 George was elected as one of the first members of the Aberdare Urban District Council and he became an advocate of free libraries. Controversy over this issue, however, led to his defeat in 1899. In 1901 George was invited, following a public meeting, to contest the Gadlys ward in the Glamorgan County Council elections. He refused, but stood three years later, attracting some criticism for opposing the Labour candidate, Evan Parker. He became a member of the County Education Committee and a governor of the Aberdare County School. George was a deacon and leading member of Heolyfelin Chapel, Aberdare. His home in later life was at The Laurels, Trecynon. George had many literary interests and was known by the pseudonym Gruffydd Dyfed, and a volume of his literary works was published in 1906.

BBC News The site was the residue of the former ancestral estate of the Victorian prime minister Sir Robert Peel. Peel and his family were declared bankrupt in 1911, with most of the house pulled down soon after. During the Second World War the estate was used as a storage depot by the Army, which left behind a sea of brambles and mounds of rubbish.Telegraph (20 September 2013) Telegraph: George Bryan. The Daily Telegraph Mr Bryan, his wife and a small team set about rejuvenating the site, and six months later the park was ready. When the theme park opened in 1950, it had one restaurant, a tea room, three hand-operated rides, and a set of second hand dodgem cars. Personal life George Bryan was born on 9 April 1921 at Kegworth, Leicestershire, where his father ran a slot machine business, and was involved in the creation of the famous Peephole machine.

The building has been the centre for civic administration for the City of Calgary since it opened in 1985 to consolidate city administration, provide council chambers, and complement old Calgary City Hall, which is used as the offices of the mayor and councillors. The structure currently houses 2,000 city employees and is open to the public on weekdays. History =Planning= Mayor Ross Alger's vision for a civic center, headlined by new municipal headquarters surrounded by a major hotel, park space and commercial real estate was put to the test in a 1979 plebiscite. The Calgary public responded by voting 51% against and 49% for Alger's vision. Alger's successor, Ralph Klein, spearhead a different strategy to assess public opinion focused on whether the City of Calgary should continue to lease private office space, or consolidate employees in a single building. By 1982, city staff were spread across 10 buildings, costing the government $1.9 million per year in rent. Calgary City Council commissioned a poll of residents, spending $80,000 in 1980 to ask whether they would support a new city owned municipal building built on city owned land in the downtown core, and whether another plebiscite was necessary. The poll concluded with 13,245 responses which were generally in favor of constructing a city-owned municipal building near Old City Hall. Klein received a mandate to construct the new municipal building following the second plebiscite was held on October 15, 1980 on whether the city should own or rent the future space, with an overwhelming majority of Calgary residents totaling 97,172 agreeing with the proposal and 38,120 in favor of leasing a building. The design of the Calgary Municipal Building endured significant criticism from residents, aldermen and others. During the Federation of Canadian Municipalities Conference in June 1985, two unnamed members of Toronto City Council were quoted by the Calgary Herald describing the Municipal Building as \\"a monstrosity\\", which was echoed by Gerald Forseth, the former president of the Alberta Architects Association. The City of Toronto purchased an advertisement in the Calgary Herald on October 12, 1985, to congratulate the City of Calgary on completing the construction of the new Municipal Building. =Design= The new Municipal Building was designed through an open competition sponsored by the city council to select the design and architect for the new building. The competition opened in early 1981 to all registered architects in Alberta, with invitations to participate sent by the city to all members of the Alberta Association of Architects. The competition called for the design of a new municipal building, the restoration and inclusion of Old City Hall and the attached administration building, and a public open space on the site built in relationship with the three structures. A total of 62 architects entered the competition, following the first stage four finalists were announced, R. L. Wilkin, Eugene N. Dub (who would go on to design Edmonton City Hall), Gerald J. Gongos, and Christopher Ballyn. On December 4, 1981 Christopher Ballyn in partnership with WZMH Architects was chosen as the design winner, and a contract was awarded by Calgary City Council. Ballyn's design called for the new Municipal Building to serve as a FOIL to Old City Hall, providing a neutral backdrop while also displaying a fresh and unique civic image. The mirrored facade facing Old City Hall at a 45¬∞ angle was chosen to reflect the historic building and the new public plaza, while minimizing the Municipal Building's apparent volume. The lower floors of the Municipal Building feature molded limestone clad walls to reflect the spirit and material of the neighbouring City Hall, while the upper floors provide a sleek, sophisticated and intricate curtain wall in contrast. =Construction= To finance the Municipal Building, Calgary City Council passed a borrowing bylaw enabling $124-million in borrowing capacity, which was above the estimated $92-million cost and $12-million in lifetime interest charges. =Time capsule= During construction the City of Calgary installed a time capsule in the Municipal Building to be opened after 99 years in 2084. The capsule which sits below a bronze plaque and showcases life in Calgary in 1985, including pins, a key from the old Imperial Hotel, and designs for the Municipal Building. Architecture The Calgary Municipal Building sits on a triangle footprint, with a silver reflective mirror glass curtain wall exterior that expands from the narrowest point of the footprint upwards six steps. Limestone veneer paneling is present on the lower vertical walls. Outside of the building is an ceremonial plaza which extends to the southern wall of Old City Hall. The central atrium spans 12-stories in height, walled by concrete and glass windows of employee offices, and capped with a rooftop skylight. The atrium connects to the offices of various City of Calgary employees using escalators and glass elevators. The council chambers are housed within a large blue cube on the first floor with the councillors seated in a semi-circle facing the public, with four entrances and capacity for 300 people. A raised corridor connects the council chambers to Old City Hall, allowing councillors to enter and exit. An underground LRT station was constructed under the Calgary Municipal Building in the event the City Hall in the event the CTrain would be moved underground.

The three story brick Federal style building was built in 1826 to house the offices of the Merrimack County Bank on the first floor, law offices on the second floor, and a public meeting space above. In 1840, the upper floor was taken over by the New Hampshire Historical Society for use as a library. The Society significantly altered the interior in the early 20th century to convert this space for display purposes. In 1952 the building was acquired by the Christian Mutual Life Insurance Company, which restored the interior to its original Federal appearance, and sold the building to a law firm in the 1970s. The building also housed the law offices of future president Franklin Pierce. The building stands on the east side of North Main Street, north of the main commercial section of downtown Concord. Its most distinctive external feature is its stepped gable ends. The five bays on the front facade are demarcated by blind arches that are slightly recessed from the main facade. Its center entry is sheltered by a pillared wooden portico added in 1921 by architect Guy Lowell as part of the Society's alterations. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is architecturally significant as a fine example of Federal period architecture, and historically significant for its association with Franklin Pierce, and with local historian Dr. Nathaniel Bouton, who wrote an important early history of Concord in a study in this building.

It was opened in 1869 by the Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway (MB&M;) - a joint line constructed and operated by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&L;) and North Staffordshire Railways (NSR). The passenger station was on the north side of Grimshaw Lane, with a goods yard on the south side. Initially services ran between and Marple, but this was soon extended so that direct trains ran between Macclesfield and Manchester London Road. A number of additional services were supplied between Bollington and Macclesfield, as a significant number of Macclesfield workers lived in Bollington. In 1921, there were 14 additional shuttle services between the two towns using a petrol railcar purchased by the Great Central Railway (GCR) (successor to the MS&L;) and nicknamed the \\"Bollington Bug\\". The Bug was replaced in 1935 by a Sentinel steam railcar that ran the shuttle service, until it was withdrawn at the start of 1939. The station buildings were built to NSR designs, as were most other structures on the MB&M;, while most train services were operated by the MS&L; and later the GCR. An exception to this being the NSR Summer Saturday services between Macclesfield and . The station closed in January 1970, along with the line between Macclesfield and Marple; the buildings were demolished and the track was lifted by the end of 1971. The trackbed now forms part of the Middlewood Way, a recreational path between Macclesfield and Marple. Part of the goods station site provides a car park for the path.

The oldest part of the courthouse building is a brick and granite two story structure, completed in 1857 to serve as a town hall and court building. The city and county used the building for town offices and county courts until 1904, when the city sold its interest in the building to the county. Between 1905 and 1907 the building was extensively remodeled to plans by local architect George S. Forrest. The courthouse has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979. As of 2018, a new courthouse had been constructed to the rear of the building, and county offices were to be moved into the original building. Building history The site where the courthouse stands has been used for civic purposes since 1790, when Concord, then a town, built a townhouse on the site. That building was enlarged in 1823 when Merrimack County was created, with Concord as its shire town. That building served both town and county functions until 1855. The present building was built in response to the need for more space by both governments, and was completed in 1857 to a design by New Hampshire native Joshua Foster. That design had more Classical Revival features than the building has now, with a mainly granite exterior, a dome on top and an arcaded front porch across the facade. The building served both city and county in that form until 1904, when the city sold its interest in the building to the county, and built a new city hall. The county then decided to renovate rather than replace the building, work which was completed in 1907. Significant alterations included the removal of the dome and arcade, construction of the Renaissance entry pavilion, and refacing the exterior in brick. A modern wing was added to the front (east side) of the building in the 20th century.

The historic building completed in 1911 serves as the offices for Calgary City Council, consisting of the office of the Mayor, fourteen Councillors and municipal Clerk. Calgary City Hall originally housed the municipal council and portions of administration from its completion in 1911 until the construction of the Calgary Municipal Building adjacent to Old City Hall in 1985, which currently houses the offices of 2,000 civic administrators. Calgary City Hall is designated a National Historic Sites of Canada, as well as a Provincial Historical Resource, and Municipal Historical Resource. History Calgary City Hall was constructed on the site of the City's first town hall, with the land donated by a private citizen in 1885, the year after the municipality was incorporated. The original wood-framed town hall only stood for a handful of years before being demolished. In the early 1900s it became apparent the growing City needed a new seat of government, and a debate ensued on the future location of the structure. In 1904, Calgary City Council found a site located on the corner of 7th Avenue and 1st Street S.E. which was suitable and available for $20,000. The plan went before the public through a pleblicite which required a two-thirds majority, and with 156 voters agreeing, and 95 against the proposition, the plan failed by a margin of 12 votes. Finally the city would settle on the site of the community's original City Hall, set back only a few feet from the current structure. The city would retain Architect William M. Dodd whose designs around Calgary included Central School (1905-1969), Clarence Block (1901), Norman Block (1902), and the Alexandra School (1904), as well as consulting on Regina's City Hall. Construction of the new structure began in 1907, and quickly encountered several financial and design issues. =Construction issues= Calgary's original wooden Town Hall - built in 1885 - is dwarfed by the new City Hall being constructed right behind it in 1910 The four-storey building was constructed with a steel structural frame supporting the Paskapoo Sandstone exterior, which became a common building material in the city following the Calgary Fire of 1886, with the sandstone sourced from the Bone and Oliver Quarry. Construction itself was filled with controversy and delays. Costs for the building continued to rise, and in April 1909 residents rejected a plebiscite for a bylaw providing additional funds for construction. Following the bylaws failure, Dodd withheld payment to the primary contractor, the Alberta Building Company, which subsequently walked off the job. Shortly afterwards in January 1910, William Dodd's employment as architect was terminated, and he was replaced with local firm Hodgson & Bates. Construction resumed following approval of a bylaw for additional funds in Spring 1910. It is estimated the project cost a total of $300,000 by the time is was completed in 1911, approximately double the initial budget. =Time capsule= A sealed copper box was placed by Calgary's 10th Mayor Arthur Leslie Cameron and former mayors George Murdoch and George Clift King on September 14, 1908 in the building's cornerstone. Amongst the items in the time capsule, a copy of the New Testament, official copy of bylaws, voters' list, various reports of city departments, various medals of various departments, and a copy of the five newspapers circulating in the city. The time capsule was opened by Mayor Naheed Nenshi in November 2018 part of the restoration of the building. =Completion= The long awaited Calgary City Hall was opened by Conservative Member of Parliament and Leader of the Opposition Robert Borden on June 26, 1911. However, the City Hall building size would be quickly become insufficient for the growing community, and by 1913, the building was already too small to house several civic services. Originally the structure served as the headquarters of the Calgary Police Service from 1911 to 1914, with 15 jail cells occupying a portion of the ground floor. Additionally, the building contained the city's court room which was conveniently located on the ground floor adjacent to the police department. When opened, a cannon was installed near the front entrance, which was replaced by a fountain. The site was landscaped with 210 palm trees; one of which survived until 1935. =Plaque= A plaque at the entrance is dedicated to the memory of Lieutenant-Colonel Russell Lambert Boyle and the 10th Battalion, CEF. Boyle was a Calgary area rancher who was killed during the 2nd Battle of Ypres while commanding the 10th Battalion, which was recruited from Calgary and Winnipeg. Plaque dedicated to the 10th Battalion, CEF and The Calgary Highlanders on the front of Calgary City Hall. Photographed 22 April 2007. Description Calgary City Hall was designed by architect William M. Dodd to reflect Calgary's role as the urban centre in Southern Alberta. Dodd was known partnering with Edward Collis Hopkins to design Regina City Hall (which was demolished in 1965), along with his other designs in Calgary caught the attention of Calgary City Council. Dodd designed the building to embody Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style, with a symmetrical form with an elevated main floor, and includes a single clock tower with a Seth Thomas Clock installed, heavy stone exterior walls, bands of recessed windows, a recessed main entrance, stone arches and keystones above many windows and entries carved with the City's coat-of-arms. Notable interior elements include a highly ornamental cast-iron staircase and sky-lit rotundas. Historical site status During the 1939 Royal Tour of Canada, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother is escorted down the stairs of Calgary City Hall by Mayor Andrew Davison. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King is following behind King George VI On October 18, 1978, Calgary City Hall was designated as a Provincial Historical Resource, the designation notes the heritage value of old Calgary City Hall lies \\"with Calgary's historic status as the urban and economic centre of Southern Alberta, and its architectural significance as a monumental civic building.\\" On November 23, 1984, Calgary City Hall was designated a National Historic Site with the name \\"Calgary City Hall National Historic Site of Canada\\". The designation referenced the historic value of the site as the only surviving example of a pre-1930s civic hall in the prairie cities, and the prominence of the Romanesque Revival style and clock tower. On April 17, 1990, the City of Calgary designated Calgary City Hall as the municipality's first Municipal Historic Resource under the Historical Resources Act. Current use The building is still used as an active office space for the office of the Mayor, members of City Council, and the municipal Clerk. The meeting chambers for Calgary City Council, meeting rooms and city administration is housed in the adjacent Calgary Municipal Building. =Restoration= The quality, condition and cost of Calgary City Hall has been a civic debate since construction started in 1907, and the structure has undergone restoration a number of changes throughout its history. The first restoration occurred in 1962 at a cost of CA$2.5 million () and addressed the interior and exterior of the building. The second restoration took place in the late 1990s with a cost of CA$9.3 million (). In late 2014, Calgary City Council approved CA$34.1 million for renewal of Old Calgary City Hall. Protective scaffolding was installed outside the building in 2014, as pieces of the original Paskapoo sandstone began falling from the building.

It actively campaigns for the Conservative Party in the British Chinese community. It has been referred to by Anne Applebaum as a lobby group that has many prominent parliamentarians as its members and one that lobbies openly within the U.K. political system. The Group has been credited with helping the Conservative Party win over the British Chinese community. In the run up to the British General Elections in 2015, it was reported by YouGov and The Times that the 'Tories have won over Britain's Chinese community' and 'the party has a 22-point lead among Britons of Chinese origin, who number roughly 400,000 in England and Wales.' The organisation's Director is based at the Conservative Campaign Headquarters at 4 Matthew Parker Street in Central London. Since its formation, the group has organised a series of high profile and well attended events by UK Cabinet Ministers in to engage the British Chinese community. The Group was launched by Boris Johnson in May 2013 to an audience of 200 from the community and then followed by an event at No. 11 Downing Street with the Chancellor George Osborne. Its parliamentary arm has regularly organised Chatham House rules events in the British Parliament with Government Ministers, politicians, reporters and leading business figures such as Sir Martin Sorrell of the WPP group, Lord Chris Patten, Carrie Gracie of BBC China. Mission statement Their mission is to develop meaningful interaction and understanding between the Conservative Party and the various British Chinese communities. The Conservative Friends of the Chinese is a member-led organisation that champions the values and culture of the British Chinese communities and emphasises the parallels with the beliefs of the Conservative Party. It strongly advocates for closer relations between China and Britain and is an impressive source of information on China, the British Chinese communities and the global Chinese Diaspora for its key stakeholders.

Jeremy Hunt MP Board and notable members Chairs: * Geoffrey Clifton- Brown MP (Parliamentary Chairman) * Lord Wei of Shoreditch (Nat Wei) The Group is reputed to be one of the largest organisations in the British Chinese community with members from all walks of the community, including key community and business leaders. Lord Michael Dobbs, the author of House of Cards, is a Board member of the group, as is Michael Bates, Baron Bates, whose wife is Chinese. Another active member of the group is also Alan Mak, the Conservative MP for Havant. He, however has been quoted in the media saying 'he cares little for his ethnic identity, preferring to focus more on the \\"bigger and more important\\" issues. He also dismissed as naive the belief that his victory would mean the party would better address the needs of the 500,000 or so British Chinese and East Asians, the country's third-largest ethnic group. \\"And I certainly have no interest in what people in Hong Kong or China think of me, because I am not representing them.

It falls primarily within the territory of Rome but parts also extend into the neighbouring towns of Ciampino and Marino. \\"Tomb of Annia Regilla in the Caffarella Park\\" The Park The park aims to be a \\"green wedge\\" between the centre of Rome and the Alban Hills to the southeast. It contains a majority of the relics of Ancient Rome to be found outside the city centre. It consists of the Appian Way, from the centre of Rome to the 10th Mile, including the Villa of the Quintilii; the Park of the Caffarella; the Tombs of Via Latina archaeological zone; and the Aqueduct Park as well as other areas not accessible to the public. History The idea of a great archaeological park between the Roman Forum and the Alban Hills dates back to Napoleonic times. Following initial restoration work on one tomb by Antonio Canova in 1807 and 1808 and subsequent restoration in the area of the Tomb of Caecilia Metella by Giuseppe Valadier, it was Pope Pius IX who took the first major steps to organize the archaeological ruins of the Appian Way, with the assistance of Luigi Canina.Paris, Rita, ‚ÄúAppia, una questione non risolta\\" in ‚ÄúLa via Appia, il bianco e il nero di un patrimonio italiano.‚Äù Electa. 2011 After Italian unification further efforts were made to develop an archaeological walk from the city centre to Rome's southeast, but this only reached as far as the Baths of Caracalla.url=http://www.parcoappiaantica.it/it/testi.asp In 1931, a new plan envisaged the Appian Way to become a great park but this idea was threatened after the Second World War with the construction of illegal villas and sports clubs close to the monuments and other housing that encroached on the edges of the zone. Moreover, the new ring road for Rome, the Grande Raccordo Anulare, cut in two the Appian Way at the seventh mile, a mistake that was only rectified with the construction of a tunnel before the Great Jubilee of 2000. The Park finally became a reality in 1988 and in 2002 it was expanded with the purchase of an area known as the Tor Marancia. The Park remains 95% in private hands: 40% is held by aristocratic Roman families; 25% by companies; 21% by small landowners and 10% by the Catholic Church. Attempts to take more of the land into public possession have been constrained by a lack of funds.Maria Pia Guermandi ‚ÄúSulla via Appia Antica‚Ä¶..Storia e cronaca per la difesa dell‚ÄôAppia da ‚ÄòIl Mondo‚Äô al web\\" in ‚ÄúLa via Appia, il bianco e il nero di un patrimonio italiano.‚Äù Electa. 2011 There remain ambitious plans to extend the Park all the way into Rome as far as the Roman Forum in one direction, and as far as the Castelli Romani park in the other. The Appian Way The Appian Way (Latin and Italian: Via Appia) was one of the earliest and strategically most important Roman roads of ancient Rome. It connected Rome to Brindisi in southeast Italy. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the road fell out of use. On the orders of Pope Pius VI the road was restored and a new Appian Way was built in 1784 in parallel with the old one, as far as the Alban Hills. The new road is the Via Appia Nuova (\\"New Appian Way\\") as opposed to the old section, now known as Via Appia Antica. Mile 1 to Mile 10 falls within the Regional Park. Noted monuments along the route include Porta Appia (Porta San Sebastiano), the gate of the Aurelian Walls, the Tomb of Priscilla, the Christian catacombs of Saint Sebastian, and Callixtus and the Jewish catacomb of Vigna Randanini, the Circus and Mausoleum of Maxentius, the Tomb of Cecilia Metella, the Roman baths of Capo di Bove, the Tomb of Hilarus Fuscus, the Mausoleum of the Orazi and Curiazi and the Mausoleum of Casal Rotondo. In places along this stretch of the road the original surface of volcanic rock is exposed. Via Latina Tombs The Tombs of Via Latina are Roman tombs, mainly from the 2nd century AD, that are found along a short stretch of the old Roman road of Via Latina, on the southeast outskirts of Rome, within the Regional Park. They now constitute an archaeological park and can be visited. The tombs were discovered in 1857-58. Excavations supported by Pope Pius IX subsequently uncovered various sepulchers and tombs along a 450m stretch of the old road.  Caffarella Valley The Caffarella Valley is a large park bordered on its northern side by the Via Latina and on its southern by the Appian Way. It extends lengthways from the Aurelian Wall up to the Via dell'Almone and contains several items of archaeological interest, as well as a working farm, and has considerable ecological value, with 78 species of birds and fauna.The Caffarella Valley. Pamphlet produced by the Parco Regionale dell'Appia Antica In Roman times much of the area was occupied by a large estate known as the Triopius. Herodes Atticus was a Greek who became a Roman senator and through his marriage to Annia Regilla he acquired the land of the estate. Two ruins in the park date from that time, the tomb of Annia Regilla and the Nympheum of Egeria. Tor Fiscale Park Six Roman aqueducts made their way into Rome through this small area, which takes its name from a 13th Century watchtower. Over the years the area was a popular encampment for armies seeking to invade Rome as it was on the Via Latina and close to the Appian Way.  Aqueducts Park The Parco degli Acquedotti is a public park of approximately 240 ha. The park is named after the aqueducts that dissect it, the Aqua Felix and the Aqua Claudia. It also contains the remains of the Villa delle Vignacce to the North West.  Villa of the Quintilii The Villa of the Quintilii (Italian: Villa dei Quintili) is an ancient Roman villa beyond the fifth mile of the Appian Way. It was built by the brothers Sextus Quintilius Maximus and Sextus Quintilius Condianus during the 2nd century.A. Ricci, Le villa dei Quintilii (Rome 1998) The villa included extensive thermae fed by its own aqueduct, and a hippodrome, dating from the fourth century. The emperor Commodus coveted the villa strongly enough to put to death the brothers in 182 and confiscate it for himself.  Villa of the sette bassi The villa lies to the south of Via Tuscolana. Its name probably derives from Septimius Bassus, prefect under the Emperor Septimius Severus (193 - 211), is second in size only to the villa of the Quintilii. It was built towards the middle of the second century, close to the fifth mile of the Via Latina, in the time of Emperor Antoninus Pius.  Tor Marancia  Slightly to the west of the main park area, Tor Marancia is an undulating, wooded area containing considerable biodiversity for an area so close to Rome's suburbs.

History  In 1950, having become acquainted at the Copenhagen Furniture Fair, Philippe and Fran√ßois Roche, and Jean-Claude and Patrick Chouchan, joined forces to import Scandinavian furniture to Paris. Soon after, they added Scandinavian giftware, such as textiles, tableware, or tapestries, to their furniture ranges. Known as ‚Äòcomplementary objects‚Äô, these accessories were sold in adjoining boutiques. 1961: The first joint national advertising campaign was launched in Elle magazine. Two campaigns a year have been created every year since, over a period of nearly 50 years. Creation of the first joint catalogue and development of a joint national network of franchises based on retail alone with no ownership of manufacturing resource, a revolutionary business model at the time. 1965: Opening of the first showroom outside France, in Belgium. In 1970 Philippe Roche and colleagues meet designer Hans Hopfer while on a trip to Germany. The latter's design for a sofa that allows you to ‚Äòlive at ground level‚Äô, initially named ‚ÄòLounge‚Äô, has, under its newer name ‚ÄòMah Jong‚Äô, been Roche Bobois's best-selling sofa design since 1990. 1973: Opening of the first showroom in Canada. 1974: Opening of the first Roche Bobois showroom in the US and in Spain. 1980s: The Roche Bobois offering is extended with the development of the Provinciales collection, aimed at new owners of country homes 1990s: development of the Voyages collection, created in response to the demand for ethnic style furniture 1995: Opening of the first showroom in Italy. Beginning of the 21st century: two developments for Roche Bobois: *Increased international development of a network of showrooms *Development of partnerships with designers and architects who start to design pieces specifically for Roche Bobois 2004: The first showroom in China is opened. The 100th showroom abroad is opened. 2009: A series of theme-based Design Competitions aimed at supporting emerging talent is launched. The first competition, organised in China, results in the design and manufacture of the gas-injection moulded Ava: created by a Chinese designer and fabricated by an Italian manufacturer. Subsequently, competitions have taken place in Morocco and most recently the UK (winner to be announced shortly). December 2011, Monsieur Philippe Roche, co-founder of the Roche Bobois brand of furniture, died, aged 77. Since 2011, Roche Bobois has launched a new collection every six months. The brand has 250 showrooms, 80 of which are corporate-owned, located in 45 countries. 2012 is the year of international growth: for the first time in its history, Roche Bobois reports more than 50% of turnover achieved abroad, notably in North America. Having been present in this region since 1974, the North America network becomes the second largest with the New York Madison store becoming the most important in the world in terms of sales. In 2013, Roche Bobois further reinforces its international presence with a scheduled programme of 15 new showroom openings in more than 10 countries, including Singapore, Colombia, Indonesia and Bulgaria. In 2015, Roche Bobois confirmed its presence in the world of art and culture as a patron of the Pavillon France of the Universal Exhibition in Milan. The following year, in 2016, Roche Bobois developed a new collection with architect Jean Nouvel. The brand also experienced strong growth with 10 new showroom openings, 8 of which were international, including in Guatemala and India.

Built in 1923, it is a prominent local work of New Hampshire native C. R. Whitcher, and is its only school in the Georgian Revival style. It is also the only surviving element of the historic village of Millville that is not part of the nearby St. Paul's School campus. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It now houses Parker Academy, a private day school. Description and history The Millville School stands in a rural-residential area of western Concord, at the northeast corner of Hopkinton Road and Fisk Road. It is located across the street from the St. Paul's School campus. It is a single story brick building with Georgian Revival features. It is covered by a hip roof, and has a projecting entry section, with a portico supported by grouped round Tuscan columns. Windows are set in rectangular openings with splayed keystoned stone lintels. The Millville area of Concord developed in the late 18th century as a small industrial village, most of whose surviving remnants are part of the St. Paul's campus. The first public school was built on the south side of Hopkinton Street in 1801, and was replaced by a larger frame building in 1860. When St. Paul's sought to expand its campus in 1895, that building was moved across the street to this location. This building was constructed in 1923 to a design by New Hampshire architect C. R. Whitcher, and is the only public building of that style in the city. The T-shaped building was extended in 1954 to add a kindergarten wing to the east, and underwent other relatively minor alterations in the 1980s, when the building was converted for use by a medical practice.

Rosa's rule, also known as Rosa's law of progressive reduction of variability,Phylogenetic Systematics, by Willi Hennig (translated from German by D. Dwight Davis and Rainer Zangerl); originally published in German in 1966; published in 1979 by University of Illinois Press (via Google Books) is a biological rule that observes the tendency to go from character variation in more primitive representatives of a taxonomic group or clade to a fixed character state in more advanced members. An example of Rosa's rule is that the number of thoracic segments in adults (or holaspids) may vary in Cambrian trilobite species, while from the Ordovician the number of thoracic segments is constant in entire genera, families, and even suborders. Thus, a trend of decreasing trait variation between individuals of a taxon as the taxon develops across evolutionary time can be observed.

The system is used by several media companies such as MDR, Yle, A+E Networks, Red Bull Media House and also by public financial institutions such as the Development Bank of Saxony. On December 2018 the first CEITON User Group Meeting took place in Leipzig, Germany. Architecture The workflow management software has a three tier architecture with an Oracle or SQL-Server-database, at the bottom level a 64bit-application layer in the mid-level and a web-interface with a patented web-based window manager, WinLike, in the upper level. The software runs on a server (on premises) or in the cloud and is scalable on parallel servers. Data security is warranted by role-based access control (RBAC). The software is used via web-browsers and not dependent on particular system software. Structure and Features CEITON combines the two classical approaches of production planning and control and workflow management. =Project Management= The scheduling system plans, manages, bills, and analyzes projects or tasks. It manages human and technical resources, material, and locations on a single GUI. The system uses a gantt chartThomas Hafen: EAI - Schneller auf kritische Ereignisse reagieren (EAI - Reacting Faster to Critical Incidents), com!professional 9/2015, retrieved September 16, 2015 to assign tasks to be done to available and eligible resources (i.e. staff), automatically or by drag-and-drop. The scheduling module includes material management, resource management/ human resource management, integration of freelancers, clients and suppliers, time-tracking, shift scheduling, quality management, delivery and logistics, document management, archive, analysis and controlling, business reporting, as well as all accounting and documentation processes.Igor ≈†uba: Project management in multi companies and products group, Master Thesis, Wien, Techn. Univ. u. Bratislava, Techn. Univ., 2014 Media companies use CEITON for managing largely repetitive projects such as producing DVDs, PlayStation games and Blu-ray discs. =Workflow= The workflow management system module coordinates business processes. Processes are defined once as a workflow and then repeatedly executed. Human resources are automatically assigned to steps (tasks) and integrated in workflow forms. Systems are integrated with an EAI/SOAP module, allowing data exchange with arbitrary external systems which are also involved in the business process. It also features a 3-D workflow overview in which the status of each project step can be determined by its color in the overview. =Process Management= For project and order processing management, business processes are designed as workflows, and coordinate communication automatically. Different user interfaces for staff, customers or suppliers can be created so each gets only relevant information. Different workflow forms are associated with different log-ins. The main application for the system is knowledge-based business processes, in which many people are involved and virtual results are produced, e.g. in research, or development of media products, such as TV and movies. Broadcasters and media companies such as MDR and Yle use CEITON to control their production processes for products and services and coordinate complex workflows with all kinds of resources. = Integrations = An integrated EAI module allows CEITON to integrate every external system in any business process without programming, using SOAP and similar technologies.

Many varieties of dried apricots are sold in Uzbekistan Chocolate-coated dried apricots, a popular type of confectionery in Russia and Kazakhstan Dried apricots are a type of traditional dried fruit. When treated with sulfur dioxide (E220), the color is vivid orange. Organic fruit not treated with sulfur vapor is darker in color and has a coarser texture. Generally, the lighter the color, the higher the SO2 content. Apricots have been cultivated in Central Asia since antiquity, and dried ones were an important commodity on the Silk Road. They could be transported over huge distances due to their long shelf life. Before the 20th century, they were ubiquitous in the Ottoman, Persian, and Russian Empires. In more recent times, California was the largest producer, before being overtaken by Turkey,The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink (ed. Andrew F. Smith). Oxford University Press, 2007. . Page 22. where about 95% of the production is provided by the Malatya Province. Small apricots are normally dried whole. Larger varieties are dried in halves, without the kernel or stone. In the former Soviet Union, the former are known as uryuk (—É—Ä—é–∫), used primarily for making kompots, and the latter as kuraga (–∫—É—Ä–∞–≥–∞). Mediterranean or Turkish varieties of dried apricots are typically dried whole and then pitted; whereas California varieties are halved and pitted before drying. Ethnic foods based on dried apricots include qubani ka meetha in India and chamoy in Mexico. Dried apricots are an important source of carotenoids (vitamin A) and potassium. Due to their high fiber-to-volume ratio, they are sometimes used to relieve constipation or induce diarrhea.Karin Cadwell, Edith White. The Natural Laxative Cookbook. Sterling Pub Co Inc, 1995. .

The skaters in yellow vests in the foreground are ball boys. A bandy field or bandy rink is an ice rink used for playing bandy. History Originally, bandy was played on naturally frozen ice, mainly on lakes.Digitaltmuseum Teams often had to take time to go out and search for the best ice to use.IFK Liken√§s, \\"Sven Olsson och Rune H√•kansson rekar efter bra is f√∂r bandyplan.\\" Soon, ice started to be created on soccer pitches in the wintertime, allowing for a more safe place to play. This may be the reason the outer measurements are the same as for a soccer field. The first artificially frozen bandy field was created in Budapest, Hungary, in 1923. In the 1980s, indoor arenas started to be built, allowing for a longer season. The world's first indoor bandy arena, the Olimpiyskiy, was built in Moscow for the 1980 Summer Olympics but has hosted many bandy events since. The field =The size= The size of a bandy field is regulated in section 1.1 of the Bandy Playing Rules set up by the Federation of International Bandy It shall be rectangular and in the range ( by ), about the same size as a football pitch for association football and considerably larger than an ice hockey rink. For international play, the field must not be smaller than times . The field is outlined with distinct and unbroken lines according to section 1.1. These lines are red and between wide, according to section 1.1 D. Standard field measurements, set in the Bandy Playing Rules =Sidelines and borders= Along the sidelines, section 1.2 of the Rules prescribes the use of a high border (board, vant, sarg, wand, wall) to be placed to prevent the ball from leaving the ice. It should not be attached to the ice, it should be able to glide upon collisions, and should end away from the corners, to allow for corner-strokes. The top should have soft protection, to avoid players getting hurt if touching it when coming at high speed. The border was originally only used in Russia, but was introduced to other countries in the 1950s when the rules of the game were standardized and the international governing federation was founded. It allows for a faster game, as the ball stays in play instead of easily leaving the field, which means it would have to be collected and thrown in. If the border is frozen to the ice during play, this can be hazardous to the players, and the referee can therefore decide to start or continue the game without such border. The same applies if strong wind relocates the border, under such circumstances the match can also be started or continued without border. This is regulated in comment section C1.8 of the Rules. The border is made of sections which each should be about long according to section 1.2 of the Rules. Section 1.3 of the Rules prescribes where players must and must not enter or leave the field: Four of these sections of the border shall be painted red on the front side as well as on the backside. These four sections are placed at the middle of the side-line on one side of the field, in front of the players' benches. All exchange of players from both teams must take place over these red-painted border pieces, i.e. over a part of the border which is about 16 m long. According to comment section C3.3 of the Rules, a player who is to be replaced, shall have left the rink before the replacing player can enter the game. Section 1.3 also states that the erroneous exchange of players is to be punished with a penalty of 5 minutes for the in-going player (this length of penalty is shown by the referee displaying a white penalty card). =Centre line and corners= A centre spot denotes the centre of the field and a circle of radius is centered at it. A centre-line is drawn through the centre spot and parallel with the shortlines. At each of the corners, a radius quarter- circle is drawn, and a dotted line is painted parallel to the shortline and away from it without extending into the penalty area. The dotted line can be replaced with a long line starting at the edge of the penalty area and extending towards the sideline, from the shortline. =The goal cage= Centered at each short-line is a wide and high goal cage, regulated to size, form, material and other properties in section 1.4 of the Rules. The cage may be made of wood, aluminium or steel and has a net to stop the ball when it has crossed the goal-line. The goal-line is the line between the goalposts; section 1.1. The cage shall be of an approved model; the approvement is made by the appropriate governing body. It shall be fitted with small spikes on underside to prevent the goal from being moved by the wind or by minor touch of a player, so that it stays in place. As long as the goal cage stays in place, the match can go on. For safety reasons, the goal-posts shall not have any sharp edges. The goal cage also has two ball baskets, one on each outer side; section 1.4 A. Balls are stored there for the goal-keeper to use when he is to set a ball in play if the ball has been shot over the end line at the side of the goal by a player from the opponent team. This allows the game to start up quicker when this has happened. In front of the goal cage is a half- circular penalty area with a radius. A penalty spot is located in front of the goal and there are two free-stroke spots at the penalty area line, each surrounded by a circle. Condition of the ice Especially for naturally frozen ice, it may occur that the ice is in too bad condition to play on. The ice shall be inspected by the referee before the game. If the referee deems that the condition of the ice is too bad, comment sections C1.1 and C1.2 allows him to decide that the match has to be cancelled. No one but the referee is allowed to decide on cancellation because of the condition of the ice (but this does not mean that either team is unable to alert the attention of the referee regarding some part of the condition of the ice). Deficiencies of the rink, including inferior ice quality, are the responsibility of the organiser of the match and according to comment section C1.4 deficiencies shall be reported to the administrative authority. Outdoors and indoors arenas Originally, bandy was played on frozen lakes, but soon football fields were started to be used, by pouring water on them in the wintertime to get a good, flat and safe ice surface. Starting in the 1980s, and increasingly since 2000, more and more indoor bandy arenas have been built, especially in Russia and Sweden.

Simply connected spaces and simple spaces are (trivial) examples of nilpotent spaces, other examples are connected loop spaces. The homotopy fibre of any map between nilpotent spaces is a disjoint union of nilpotent spaces, the null component of the pointed mapping space Map_*(K,X) where K is a pointed finite dimensional CW complex and X is any pointed space, is a nilpotent space. The odd-dimensional real projective spaces are nilpotent spaces, while the projective plane is not. A basic theorem about nilpotent spaces states that any map that induces an integral homology isomorphism between two nilpotent space is a weak homotopy equivalence. Nilpotent spaces are of great interest in rational homotopy theory, because most constructions applicable to simply connected spaces can be extended to nilpotent spaces. The Bousfield Kan nilpotent completion of a space associates with any connected pointed space X a universal space X^ through which any map of X to a nilpotent space N factors uniquely up to contractible space of choices, often however, X^ itself is not nilpotent but only an inverse limit of a tower of nilpotent spaces. This tower, as a pro-space, always models the homology type of the given pointed space X. Nilpotent spaces admit a good arithmetic localization theory in the sense of Bousfield and Kan cited above, and the unstable Adams spectral sequence strongly converges for any such space. Let X be a nilpotent space and let h be a reduced generalized homology theory, such as K-theory. If h(X)=0, then h vanishes on any Postnikov section of X. This follows from a theorem that states that any such section is X-cellular.

The IOC Evaluating Committee favoured the location of all alpine events in one venue, Jasn√°, which had already hosted World Cup and several international competitions and was located 60 minutes from the Main Olympic Village. The experience of the Slovak Republic in providing high profile event security was rated as moderate, but the country itself hadn't experienced unusual security problems. A referendum held in the communes of the region, as well as opinion polls in 1997 and 1998 throughout Slovakia, showed a considerable majority in support of the bid.Whilst an Olympic Games marketing programme was new to Slovakia, the Bid Committee appeared to have shown diligence in evaluating the possibilities in marketing plans and opportunities. However, the IOC evaluating report listed some problems that might have effected the Winter Games preparations. The proximity of a major road to the biathlon venue in ≈†trba may have been a concern for the performance of the athletes. Although Svit, where bobsleigh, luge and skeleton track was planned, is not within the National Park, there could have been environmental concerns as much deforestation was required. The Bid Committee had been unable to secure a partner willing to cover the cost of constructing the Olympic Village. Further, the Evaluation Commission considered that the operating budget of the Village appears to be on the low side and no budget could have been found for the additional accommodations. The Evaluation Commission believed also that accommodation in Poprad needed to be further developed. While the proposed highway and railway transport concept was considered as sufficient, the Poprad-Tatry Airport could accepted only medium sized jet aircraft, and didn't have regularly scheduled flights. The Evaluation Commission believed that the costs of building infrastructure for and putting on the Olympic Games, would be a significant challenge to the financial resources of both the public and private sectors in Slovakia.

Unraced as a two-year-old he showed promising form at three while appearing to be slightly below top class. He reached his peak as a four-year-old when he won the Prix Edmond Blanc in France before taking two major prizes in England. In May he defeated the leading filly In The Groove in the Lockinge Stakes over a mile and in September he beat a strong field to win the Ladbroke Sprint Cup over six furlongs. As a breeding stallion he is best known as the sire of Pivotal. He died in 2001 at the age of fourteen. Background Polar Falcon was a dark bay or brown horse, standing 15.2 hands high (making him rather small for a male Thoroughbred) bred in Kentucky by Edward A Seltzer. He was sired by Nureyev best known as a racehorse for being disqualified after beating Known Fact and Posse to \\"win\\" the 2000 Guineas in 1980. Apart from Polar Falcon, Nureyev was the sire of the winners of at least forty-five Group One/Grade I including Peintre Celebre, Soviet Star, Sonic Lady, Spinning World, Zilzal, Stravinsky and Miesque. His career as a stallion has been described as \\"outstanding\\". Polar Falcon's dam Marie d'Argonne showed some ability as a racehorse, winning at Saint-Cloud Racecourse in 1984 (when she was rated 104 by Timeform), and twice when sent to compete in the United States in 1985. As a descendant of the broodmare she was a distant relative of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Sassafras. Marie d'Argonne also produced Marie Rheinberg, the dam of the Prix du Jockey Club winner Le Havre. As a yearling, Polar Falcon was sent to the Keeneland sales in July 1988 but was not sold as he failed to reach his reserve price of $425,000. He later entered the ownership of Michel Zerolo and was sent to race in Europe where he was sent into training with John Hammond in France. Racing career =1990: three-year- old season= Polar Falcon was a very late foal, being born on 1 June 1987, and did not race until he was three years old. He won on his debut at Longchamp Racecourse on 8 April 1990 and then finished fourth at the same track on five weeks later. On 27 May he was moved up in class for the Group One Prix Jean Prat and finished fourth of the six runners behind Priolo. In July, he recorded his second victory when he won the Prix Pelleas over 1700 metres at Longchamp. He failed to win again in his remaining races that year, but never finished worse than fourth. He finished fourth in the Group Three Prix Quincey at Deauville Racecourse and was then campaigned in Germany where he finished third in the Elite-Preis and second in the Grosser Preis von D√ºsseldorf. On his final appearance of the season he returned to France and finished second in the Listed Prix du Pont du Jour at Longchamp in October. At the end of the season Polar Falcon was bought privately by David and Patricia Thompson, the owners of the Cheveley Park Stud. =1991: four-year-old season= Polar Falcon began his four-year-old season in the Group Three Prix Edmond Blanc over 1600m on soft ground at Evry Racecourse on 1 April. Ridden by Cash Asmussen, he was towards the rear of the eleven runner field in the early stages before accelerating into the lead 200m from the finish and recorded his most important success up to that time as he beat Boxing Day easily by one and a half lengths. On 17 May, the colt was sent to England for the first time when he contested the Lockinge Stakes (then a Group Two race) at Newbury Racecourse. Ridden by the veteran Lester Piggott he started at odds of 3/1 in a four-runner field headed by the multiple Group One winning filly In The Groove, who was made the 1/2 favourite. Polar Falcon recovered from a slow start to take the lead inside the final furlong and won by two lengths from In The Groove, with the Premio Parioli winner Candy Glen in third. In July, Polar Falcon returned to England and was brought back to sprint distances for the July Cup over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. He was towards the rear of the field before making some progress in the closing stages to finish fourth of the eight runners behind Polish Patriot, Lycius and Elbio. The colt's next race was the Group One Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville in August. In closely contested finish he was beaten less than three quarters of a length as he took fourth place behind Hector Protector, Lycius and Danseuse du Soir. On 7 September, Polar Falcon was ridden by Asmussen in the Group One Ladbroke Sprint Cup at Haydock Park Racecourse. He started at 13/2 in a field of six runners which also included Shadayid (1000 Guineas), Mystiko (2000 Guineas) and Sheikh Albadou (Nunthorpe Stakes). As usual, the French-trained colt was held up at the back of the field before making a challenge in the last quarter mile. After being switched to the right by Asmussen, he overtook Sheikh Albadou inside the final furlong and won in \\"impressive\\" style by one and a half lengths, with a gap of three and a half lengths back to Shadayid in third. On his final appearance he was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs in November. He was the 8.9/1 fourth choice in the betting but made no impact, finishing eleventh of the fourteen runners behind Opening Verse. Stud record Polar Falcon was retired from racing to stand at the Cheveley Park Stud in Newmarket. By far his most important offspring was Pivotal, one of his first crop of foals, who won the King's Stand Stakes and the Nunthorpe Stakes, before becoming a very successful breeding stallion, siring many major winners including Megahertz, Somnus, Peeress, Halfway to Heaven, Sariska, Izzi Top and Farhh. Polar Falcon's other progeny included the Premio Roma winners Sunstrach and Shibuni's Falcon, the Coronation Stakes winner Exclusive and the leading hurdler Intersky Falcon. On December 5, Polar Falcon was euthanised at Rossdales and Partners' Veterinary Clinic in Newmarket following a short illness believed to be the result of a tumour in his lung. The Cheveley Park Stud's director, Chris Richardson, described him as \\"a kind horse with an immense character, who gave us many many magical moments both on the racecourse and through his progeny\\".

But not so long after the struggles worsened, and debt to the South Korean Government increased instead. The financial issue re-surfaced even worse in 2008, and by this point school enrollment shrunk approximately 75% with just 56 students, compared to its 1992 records which had over 200 students.

A Traube cell is an \\"artificial cell\\" created by Moritz Traube in order to study the processes of living cells, including growth and osmosis. The Traube cell is not a true artificial cell, as it is not living and does not have true biological processes of its own. History Mortiz Traube was a German student of the German chemist Justus von Liebig in the mid-19th century. In 1867, Traube developed the Traube cell from copper ferrocyanide, in order to study the properties of plasma membranes. The artificial cell would expand and bud like living cells. Surgeon and professor Wilhelm Pfeffer used this model to study and coin the term \\"plasma membrane\\". Structure The Traube precipitation membrane consists of copper ferrocyanide and forms readily on a surface of crystal potassium ferrocyanide when the crystal is put into a dilute solution of copper sulfate. The membrane is semi-permeable, and expands rapidly into the Traube cell. Within the cell is a high concentration of potassium ferrocyanide with strong osmotic force. While it cannot diffuse outward, water and the copper sulfate solution can flow inwards. When the expansion caused the membrane to burst, a new membrane was quickly formed. In this way, the cell could \\"grow\\" and become several centimeters long. The ability of the Traube cell membrane to allow water to flow in while retaining the cell solute is comparable to living cells.

By his own account, he was born in Cologne, perhaps around 1500. Described as a \\"shooter, cannonier and fireworker,\\" Helm fought with the armies of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V against the Ottoman Empire. He subsequently moved to Landshut in the then Duchy of Bavaria, where he served the dukes William IV, Louis X and Albert V. He later served John II, Count Palatine of Simmern. Two of Helm's works have survived to the present day. In the 1520s he wrote a comprehensive description of an 'ideal' armoury which, though it has not survived as a stand-alone work, is found incorporated into some texts of his later surviving work, the Buch von den probierten K√ºnsten (\\"Book of the practical arts\\"). This was given in manuscript form to his patron, Duke Albert V, some years before the end of Helm's career. Whether it had any practical influence on the duke's army is unclear but it is possible that the later construction of the royal armoury at Munich's Marstallplatz followed Helm's recommendations.Lang, p. 337 The book follows a format that had become quite traditional by that point, albeit with the inclusion of modern elements. It is organised in the same fashion as the highly influential Feuerwerkbuch of 1420, reproducing many of the earlier book's instructions verbatim. Helm writes in several places that he had drawn on old \\"art books\\" in compiling his own book. Although he treats the older material respectfully, he does not shy away from criticising outdated methods ‚Äì for instance, describing some old-style artillery pieces as curiosities and calling one method of shooting described in the Feuerwerkbuch as \\"strange\\" ‚Äì and provides updated information on modern methods and equipment. In various places, he explicitly calls new artillery methods \\"novel\\" and \\"superior\\".Lang, p. 337 Although his book circulated widely in manuscript form, it was not until 1625 that it appeared in print under the title Armamentarium principale oder Kriegsmunition und Artillerie- Buch (\\"Principles of armament, or book of war munitions and artillery\\"). 'Rocket cat' One method described by Helm has attracted attention for its illustration of what has been dubbed a 'rocket cat' ‚Äì a feline with what appears to be a rocket on its back propelling it towards a castle or fortified town. The same illustration also shows what appears to be a rocket-propelled dove. The illustration appears in various forms in different manuscript versions of Helm's book, as well as in the 1625 printed edition. The images appear in a section titled \\"To set fire to a castle or city which you can't get at otherwise,\\" in which Helm describes ways of using incendiary devices strapped to animals to set fortified places on fire. He writes: Mitch Fraas of the University of Pennsylvania, which has a copy of Helm's manuscript, writes that \\"there is no way to know if Helm himself ever employed this method of pyrotechnic warfare.\\" He describes it as \\"sort of a harebrained scheme. It seems like a really terrible idea, and very unlikely the animals would run back to where they came from. More likely they'd set your own camp on fire.\\" Helm was not the first to propose or use incendiary animals; the Biblical figure Samson is described as attaching torches to the tails of three hundred foxes, leaving the panicked beasts to run through the fields of the Philistines, burning all in their wake. Early Sanskrit texts, Russian and Scandinavian sources mention cats and birds bearing incendiary devices, while the 10th century Chinese manual Hu Chhien Ching and its 11th century successor Wu Ching Tsung Yao describe and illustrate a series of \\"fire animals\\". These include \\"apricot-stone fire sparrows\\" carrying burning tinders attached to their legs inside an apricot stone, with the hope that they would fly into the enemy's granaries and set them on fire, and \\"magic-fire flying crows\\", artificial birds powered by four rocket tubes.

It was opened in 1869 by the Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway (MB&M;) - a joint line constructed and operated by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&L;) and North Staffordshire Railways (NSR). Initially the station was known simply as Poynton, although in some MS&L; timetables it was described as Poynton for Lyme Park. The station buildings were built to NSR designs, as were most other structures on the MB&M;, while train services were operated by the MS&L; (later the GCR). Much of the goods revenue for the station came from the coal mines and, when these closed in the 1920s, the spur leading off the line to the collieries was lifted. To avoid confusion with Poynton railway station, on the main line between Manchester and Stoke-on-Trent, the station was renamed Higher Poynton in 1930. During the Second World War, the signal box at Higher Poynton was only operational as required for shunting - most of the time it remained shut saving the need to employ three signalmen; the station also employed two female porters for the duration of the war and a short period after. The station closed in January 1970, when the line between Macclesfield and Marple closed; the buildings were demolished and the track lifted by the end of spring 1971. The trackbed now forms part of the Middlewood Way, a recreational path between Macclesfield and Marple, and the station site forms a car park and picnic site.

T. Stamatiad (common rendition of Alexandru Teodor Maria Stamatiad, or Stamatiade; May 9, 1885 ‚Äì December 1955) was a Romanian Symbolist poet, short story writer, and dramatist. A late arrival on the local Symbolist scene, he was primarily active as a literary promoter and, in 1918, editor of Literatorul review. Discovered and praised by Alexandru Macedonski and Ion Minulescu, he combined his presence in radical Symbolist circles with stints on more culturally conservative ones, crossing between the extremes of Romanian literature. By 1911, he had established himself in cultural and social circles as an exotic and vocal, sometimes violent, cultural debater. Stamatiad's parallel career as a schoolteacher took him to the city of Arad, where he lived at two distinct intervals, animating cultural life in the Romanian circles. Beyond his own poetry and prose, which received mixed reviews, Stamatiad worked on popularizing foreign literature, translating Symbolists such as Maurice Maeterlinck and Charles Baudelaire, but also more traditional works of Omar Khayy√°m and Li Bai, and experimenting with genres such as haiku. He was generally considered an authority on, and imitator of, Oscar Wilde. At the center of controversies with Macedonski, and later with the youth at SburƒÉtorul circle, Stamatiad sided with the anti-modernist side of Romanian Symbolism, folding back on conservatism. He faded into relative obscurity during World War II, and lived in isolation and poverty after the establishment of a Romanian communist regime. Biography =Early life= Born in Bucharest, Stamatiad(e) was the illegitimate son of Maria Stamatiade and of Lieutenant-Colonel Theodor Pallady. Painter Theodor Iancu Pallady and actress Lucia Sturdza-Bulandra were cousins of his, while Alexandrina Cantacuzino, the feminist campaigner, was a half-sister.CƒÉlinescu, p.702, 1016Lidia Bote, Antologia poeziei simboliste rom√¢ne»ôti, Editura pentru literaturƒÉ, Bucharest, 1968, p.255 Through his paternal grandmother, Alexandru Teodor descended from the prestigious Ghica family, and, according to literary historian George CƒÉlinescu, was always overly preoccupied with his origins and his illegitimacy.CƒÉlinescu, p.702 The poet used as his full name Alexandru Teodor Maria Stamatiad, Cornelia »òtefƒÉnescu, \\"Via»õa documentelor\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 45/2002 including his patronymic, adapted as Teodor (although sometimes shortened to Th., as in Al. Th. Stamatiad). His eccentric styling with the matronymic Maria was a subject of ridicule among his literary peers.Cruceanu, p.57-58; RƒÉdulescu, p.140, 159, 185 To his friends, he interchangeably was Stamatiad or Stamatiade, even as late as 1920.CƒÉlinescu, p.1003 Dropping the final e of his foreign-sounding surname, which most likely indicates a Hellenic heritage, signifies a voluntary Romanianization.Alexandru Graur, Nume de persoane, Editura »ôtiin»õificƒÉ, Bucharest, 1965, p.98. In 1903, at the K√ºbler Coffeehouse, Stamatiad met Alexandru Macedonski, senior leader of the Romanian Symbolist school. Using the pen name Adrian Alexandru, he made his first contributions to literature in the review Pleiada (1904), then in Ionescu-Caion's literary newspaper, Rom√¢nul Literar.Mihail Straje, Dic»õionar de pseudonime, anonime, anagrame, astronime, criptonime ale scriitorilor »ôi publici»ôtilor rom√¢ni, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1973, p.16, 666. He was enlisted at a boarding school in the distant city of Ia»ôi, while his family remained in Bucharest.Cruceanu, p.26 Around 1905, he returned to Bucharest, to attend Matei Basarab and Sf√¢ntul Gheorghe high schools. He began frequenting the literary club formed at Macedonski's Rafael Street townhouse, where he also introduced two young poets and boarding school mates, Mihail Cruceanu and Eugeniu Sperantia. As noted by Cruceanu, Stamatiad was cultivating valuable connections in the literary press, looking upon his colleagues \\"with a protective air.\\" Other regulars included Mircea Demetriade, Al. Gherghel, »òerban Bascovici, Donar Munteanu,Cruceanu, p.29-30 and critic V. V. Hane»ô, who was impressed by Stamatiad's self-confidence, which \\"even seemed a bit too much for his age.\\"Hane»ô, p.205 Cruceanu also recalls that Stamatiad \\"never did doubt his significance\\".Cruceanu, p.57-58 Making his full debut under Macedonski's auspices, Stamatiad was also active in rival Symbolist milieus. Another Symbolist mentor, Ovid Densusianu, hosted his poem, SingurƒÉtate (\\"Solitude\\"), in the Symbolist tribune Viea»õa NouƒÉ. In 1906, it also published Stamatiad's versions of Horace's Odes. According to researcher Nicolae Laslo, they read \\"more like adaptations\\" than sheer translations, being both simplified and personalized. Nicolae Laslo, \\"Hora»õiu √Æn literatura rom√¢nƒÉ\\", in G√¢nd Rom√¢nesc, Nr. 11‚Äì12/1935, p.545 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Stamatiad and Macedonski continued to correspond even during those periods when Macedonski was out of the country, on a self-imposed exile, while Stamatiad had not yet passed his baccalaureate examination. Together with Cruceanu and Sperantia, he took up the cause of popularizing Macedonski's Symbolism in Henric Streitman's newspaper, Prezentul.Cruceanu, p.40 Soon, Stamatiad became a favorite among the disciples: Macedonski referred to him as \\"a very great poet\\", \\"brilliant and powerful\\",CƒÉlinescu, p.532, 1003 seeing him as the Romanian Rollinat.Cruceanu, p.33 As noted by CƒÉlinescu, these were patent exaggerations. Stamatiad, he argues, was in fact \\"mediocre\\".CƒÉlinescu, p.532; Mitchievici, p.359 =At Convorbiri Critice= Macedonski continued to tout Stamatiad when the younger poet also joined the Neoclassicists at Convorbiri Critice. At a club session in 1910, Stamatiad, Anastasie M√¢ndru, and I. Dragoslav demanded that Macedonski's work be read and reassessed, thus putting an end to Macedonski's critical marginalization.Vianu, p.379 The circle's leader, Mihail Dragomirescu, allowed Stamatiad to publish in the eponymous magazine, as well as in his other sheet, Falanga LiterarƒÉ »ôi ArtisticƒÉ. Stamatiad was enthusiastically welcomed to the \\"far left\\" of Dragomirescu's club by a fellow Symbolist, Ion Minulescu. Ion D. T√ÆlvƒÉnoiu, Vasile Radian, \\"Ion Minulescu - Mihail Dragomirescu, Coresponden»õa ineditƒÉ\\", in Memoria Oltului, p.39-40 In 1910, however, Falanga published a heated exchange of messages between Stamatiad and Minulescu, over the issue of Minulescu's rivalry with another Symbolist, N. Davidescu. Simona Vasilache, \\"Anul literar 1910\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 8/2011 Like Minulescu,CƒÉlinescu, p.601 Stamatiad also courted the traditionalist, nominally anti-Symbolist, camp, publishing works in SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul review. According to nationalist culture critic and SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul contributor Nicolae Iorga, Stamatiad's presence there indicated that the magazine was yet \\"unclear\\" in its direction: Stamatiad could contribute, even if \\"the magazine's ideology was indifferent to him, if not indeed hostile to him.\\"Iorga, p.216 Another reading is provided by literary historian Paul Cernat, who sees Stamatiad's participation in traditionalism as indicative of \\"an split identity within the 'conservative' side of local Symbolism.\\"Cernat, p.18-19 At the other end of the political spectrum, Stamatiad also cultivated a friendship with the socialist poet-publicist Vasile Demetrius, who featured his poetry in the review Via»õa SocialƒÉ.Iorga, p.219 In 1909, Stamatiad was a registered witness at Demetrius' civil wedding ceremony (another was critic Ilarie Chendi).CƒÉlinescu, p.727 With such universal backing, he put out his first volume of verse, Din tr√¢mbi»õe de aur (\\"With Trumpets of Gold\\"). Although it went through four editions between 1910 and 1931,CƒÉlinescu, p.1016 and was reviewed with sympathy by Hane»ô,Hane»ô, passim the work was not popular with most critics. It rather made Stamatiad the object of derision in the literary circles. Stamatiad persevered and worked with dramatist Constantin R√¢ule»õ on the play Femei ciudate (\\"Strange Women\\"), published in Convorbiri Critice in November 1910, and as a volume in 1911.Anghelu»õƒÉ et al., p.92, 343; CƒÉlinescu, p.722, 1016, 1018; Mitchievici, p.597 It was first staged in Bucharest by the \\"Modern Theater\\" company of Alexandru Davila.LazƒÉr Cosma, \\"Cronica teatralƒÉ\\", in Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, Nr. 22/1910, p.312-313Anghelu»õƒÉ et al., p.92, 343 The text intrigued the public with its frank display of a sexual masochism disorder; according to Dragomirescu, it is \\"well written, but strange.\\"Dragomirescu, p.167 In 1912 and 1913, Stamatiad completed and published translations from Maurice Maeterlinck's plays: Intruder, Interior, The Blind. They were all grouped together, as the \\"Cycle-of-Death\\" plays, in a 1914 edition at Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ publishers.Mitchievici, p.145, 397 As early as August 1909, Cassian Maria Spiridon, \\"Secolul breslei scriitorice»ôti\\", in Convorbiri Literare, April 2008 Stamatiad also rallied with Emil G√¢rleanu's Romanian Writers' Society (SSR), with which he toured the Romanian-speaking communities of Austria-Hungary. On Thomas Sunday 1911, »òerban Cioculescu, \\"Caragiale »ôi ardelenii, V. Caragiale la Rom√¢nul\\", in Universul Literar, Nr. 35/1939, p.5 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Romanian activists in the then-Hungarian city of Arad welcomed him to a \\"literary workshop\\". An official banquet was held at the White Cross Hotel.CƒÉlinescu, p.634 Stamatiad's visit took place in the midst of political crisis: the territorial National Romanian Party of Transylvania had split into two wings, of which the conservative one, well-represented in Arad, made efforts to appease the Hungarian administration. Stamatiad and the other arrivals stood accused of pushing the irredentist cause, but they denied this was the case, publishing an explanatory open letter. He diversified his contributions to the Symbolist literary press, rallying with Densusianu's Versuri »ôi ProzƒÉ circleCƒÉlinescu, p.684; Cernat, p.55; Mitchievici, p.144-145 and having some of his poetry published in Simbolul.Iorga, p.242 He also founded a single-issue magazine, GrƒÉdina Hesperidelor (\\"Garden of the Hesperides\\"). Remembered for its promotion of Art Nouveau aesthetics,Cernat, p.31, 97, 304 it featured reviews of Din tr√¢mbi»õe de aur by Densusianu, Dragomirescu, and Chendi, as well as articles or poems by Bascovici, Dimitrie Anghel, Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo, I. M. Ra»ôcu, and Barbu Solacolu.\\"Revista revistelor\\", in Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, Nr. 12/1912, p.80 =Between Literatorul and SburƒÉtorul= In 1914, having graduated in literature from the University of Bucharest, Stamatiad was named professor of French in Arad, followed by a post in Bucharest. In January of the next year, he and Minulescu were among the newly elected members of the SSR Committee. As Macedonski's right hand, and as a regular of coffeehouses and bars such as K√ºbler and Casa Cap»ôa, Stamatiad became a legendary figure in bohemian circles, involved in cultural disputes as well as brawls.Peltz, p.77, 105; RƒÉdulescu, p.16-17, 18, 19-20 Cartoonist Neagu RƒÉdulescu describes Stamatiad at this moment in time: \\"Al. T. Stamatiad, with his mustache curled up to the brim of his hat, with his cane in 'shoulder position', could not be resisted by any young lady.\\"RƒÉdulescu, p.17 According to Macedonski's novelist friend, I. Peltz, he was a spectacular presence on their circle: contentious, even \\"furious\\" and \\"terrorizing\\", lacking literary value, but forcing his pupils to read his work in class.Peltz, p.105, 129, 132, 142-145, 178 Peltz writes that the only other person who could stand up to him was a Stan Palanca, the perennially unemployed poet-bohemian.Peltz, p.143-144 World War I interfered with both Stamatiad's career and his affiliations: unlike the increasingly conservative and Germanophile Macedonski, Stamatiad supported the Entente Powers. He was a refugee in Moldavia during southern Romania's occupation by the Central Powers. Returning to Ia»ôi, which he called \\"the holy citadel of my Motherland\\", he began work on a series of religious and wartime patriotic pieces, called Pe drumul Damascului (\\"On the Road to Damascus\\").Iorga, p.251 Still active in the literary circles, and writing for the nationalist review Rom√¢nia,V. CurticƒÉpeanu, \\"Lupta lui Octavian Goga pentru realizarea statului rom√¢n unitar\\", in Studii. RevistƒÉ de Istorie, Nr. 5/1969, p. 938 he became involved in the cultural scene of neighboring Bessarabia, supporting her union with Romania after January 1918.

Seria Istorie, Vol. IV, 2005, p.143 In March, as the Moldavian Democratic Republic effected this union, Stamatiad was also a SSR delegate to the Chi»ôinƒÉu celebrations, where he met composer George Enescu. Iulius Popa, \\"O concluzie despre Cronica Basarabiei\\", in Literatura »ôi Arta, February 26, 2014 After the 1918 peace agreement, Stamatiad restored his links with the Symbolists in Bucharest, which was still administrated by the Central Powers. When Macedonski's Literatorul reappeared there in summer 1918, several months before the sudden end of occupation, Stamatiad agreed to act as editor-in- chief. He worked intensely on publishing a dossier of favorable replies to Macedonski's poems, with the goal of restoring his mentor's reputation (the project was discreetly managed by Macedonski himself). Stamatiad enlisted literary contributions from Peltz (who also helped edit the magazine), Demetrius, and Tudor Vianu.Iorga, p.214 Nonetheless, Stamatiad soon renounced his Literatorul position, following a political dispute with Macedonski. Specifically, he asked Macedonski not to publish a praise of the military governor, August von Mackensen, but found himself ignored.Vianu, p.383 A parting letter from Macedonski shows that they could not agree over \\"what [Stamatiad] calls patriotism\\", and rejects all of Stamatiad's suggestions about maintaining a low profile. The dispute was amiable, with Macedonski implying that Stamatiad could always return to Literatorul if he so wished. Peltz, who left at the same time as Stamatiad, also disavowed Macedonski's initiative, calling it \\"inane\\".Peltz, p.75 The magazine soon went out of print‚Äîaccording to Iorga, the \\"shame\\" of Mackensen's homage piece \\"could not be washed off\\". The friendship was not mended before Macedonski's death in December 1920, but Stamatiad remained in correspondence with the writer's eldest son, Nikita Macedonski; one such letter includes a full and early account of the circumstances in which Macedonski died.CƒÉlinescu, p.1003; Vianu, p.385 After parting with Literatorul, Stamatiad became one of the old- school Symbolists affiliated with the generic-modernist review SburƒÉtorul, whose editor was critic Eugen Lovinescu.Ovid CrohmƒÉlniceanu, Literatura rom√¢nƒÉ √Æntre cele douƒÉ rƒÉzboaie mondiale, Vol. I, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1972, p.24. ; Iorga, p.258 His presence there was often a disturbance for other members, including Lovinescu and Felix Aderca. His colleagues found him too preoccupied with his posterity, and too edgy at club sessions, but welcomed him as a picturesque figure. After planning, together with Ion Pillat, a never-completed anthology of international Symbolism, Barbu Cioculescu, \\"Firul vremii √Æn concertul vocilor\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 6/2001; Cornelia Pillat, \\"Voluptatea lecturii\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 35/1999 Stamatiad returned to the literary scene of Greater Romania in 1918, with the plaquette MƒÉrgƒÉritare negre (\\"Black Pearls\\"), illustrated by Iosif Iser.Anghelu»õƒÉ et al., p.343 He also resumed his teaching career, and, after the repressed strike of December 1918, personally expelled revolutionary socialist students such as Belu Zilber from his school.Andrei »òerbulescu, Monarhia de drept dialectic. A doua versiune a memoriilor lui Belu Zilber, Humanitas, Bucharest, 1991, p.25-26. =1920s= Following Transylvania's unification with Romania, Stamatiad made his return to Arad, where, in 1920, he worked as a government censor for the daily Rom√¢nul.See credits for Cenzurat: Alex.

It was followed in 1923 by a definitive edition of Pe drumul Damascului, with the subtitle \\"Religious Poetry\\".CƒÉlinescu, p.1016; Iorga, p.251 That year, he joined the SSR's Liviu Rebreanu, Eugeniu Botez, I.

Via»õa »ôi opera, Editura Biblioteca Bucure»ôtilor, Bucharest, 2001, p.176. Stamatiad continued testing his abilities as a translator. His early contributions were selections of prose poetry and aphorisms by the Symbolist forerunner Charles Baudelaire, published as a volume by AdevƒÉrul newspaper. He followed up with a Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ selection from Oscar Wilde (which featured Stamatiad's version of The Ballad of Reading Gaol), and then with a 1923 reissue of Maeterlinck's \\"Cycle-of-Death\\".CƒÉlinescu, p.1016. See also Perpessicius, p.139-140 Together with his old friend Davidescu, Stamatiad took over artistic leadership over the Bucharest magazine FlacƒÉra, in its new edition of May 1922, and gave it a Symbolist agenda.Iorga, p.263 He was intensely involved in the literary life of the old and new Romanian provinces, from Transylvania to Northern Dobruja, allowing his poems to be hosted by numerous (if short-lived) regional magazines. Translations of his poetry saw print in the Arad Hungarophone modernist tribune, Fekete Macska. Ion Mierlu»õiu, \\"Un 'cvartet' modernist la Arad, √Æn perioada interbelicƒÉ\\", in Revista Arca, Nr. 7-8-9/2010 Later, as a regular of Tiberiu Vuia's √énnoirea circle, Stamatiad became known not just as one of Arad's leading Romanian poets, but also as one who strengthened the Romanian side in the \\"culture war\\" with Regency Hungary.

Bezviconi, Necropola Capitalei, Nicolae Iorga Institute of History, Bucharest, 1972, p. 254 with whom he attended the major cultural and social events of western Transylvania. Alexandru Ruja, \\"Ovidiu Cotru»ô ‚Äì √Ænceputurile literare\\", in Orizont, Nr. 1/2007 While teaching at the Moise NicoarƒÉ High School in Arad in 1925, he put out his own review, Salonul Literar (\\"The Literary Salon\\"). It was only in print until May 1926, but made a mark on the local literary scene. Overall, Salonul Literar looked back to the age of Denusianu and Macedonski, with additional contributions from Demetrius, Minulescu, Gherghel, and Mihail Celarianu. It also hosted pieces by, among other, the Arad modernists Aron Cotru»ô (young Transylvania's \\"most talented poet\\", according to Stamatiad) and Perpessicius, and the traditionalist Gheorghe Bogdan-DuicƒÉ.Iorga, p.268 Salonul Literar had Stamatiad himself for a literary reviewer, columnist, and ideologue; as literary historians note, he aimed to copy Macedonski's leadership style. He translated and published lyrical pieces by his usual references, Baudelaire and Wilde, but also from Guillaume Apollinaire and Villiers de l'Isle Adam. Stamatiad's contribution to criticism, however, was a relative failure, according to philologist Ion Mierlu»õiu: Stamatiad gave poor reviews to Lucian Blaga, but was enthusiastic about Marcel Romanescu. Also in Arad, Stamatiad published a series of essays and memoirs popularizing the work of several poets, from Iuliu Cezar SƒÉvescu and Octavian Goga to Maeterlinck.CƒÉlinescu, p.1015, 1016; Perpessicius, p.174 V. Jeleru, \\"Note rom√¢ne»ôti\\", in Universul Literar, Nr. 10/1943, p.3 (digitized by the Babe»ô- Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Another selection of his own poetry was issued by Casa »òcoalelor in 1926, as Poezii (\\"Poems\\"). By the late 1920s, Stamatiad's work as a translator concentrated on the classics of Persian literature and Chinese poetry. In 1927, Ritmul Vremii newspaper featured his selections from Omar Khayy√°m's Quatrains (other such translations had been put out, in other newspapers, by Emanoil Bucu»õa and Zaharia Stancu). =1930s and World War II= Stamatiad's full Khayy√°m translations were published as a volume in 1932, at Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, followed, the next year, by an anthology of Li Bai's poems, 36 of which had been hosted by Convorbiri Literare in its October 1932 issue. B., \\"DƒÉri de seamƒÉ. Reviste primite la redac»õie\\", in »öara B√¢rsei, Nr. 1/1933, p.91 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) He was under contract with Romanian Radio, where, despite having a \\"cracking\\" voice,Cruceanu, p.88 he recorded readings of his own poems. The literary magazine Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ gave them a sarcastic reception, calling his reading an \\"Orphic\\" feast of \\"flutes and trumpets\\", and implied that Stamatiad should not have ever been allowed airtime.P. Nicanor & Co., \\"Miscellanea. Al. T. Stamatiad la Radio\\", in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 11/1933, p.38 Stamatiad's career peaked in the later interwar period, when he was honored with several prizes by the SSR and the Romanian Academy. In 1936, AdevƒÉrul published, as a standalone brochure, his Peisagii sentimentale (\\"Sentimental Landscapes\\"). A year later, Dem. Bassarabeanu issued a critical review of his entire work, thought to have been the only one such monograph in existence before 2002. Stamatiad was awarded the National Poetry Prize in 1938, and had \\"definitive editions\\" of Cetatea cu por»õile √Ænchise and Pe drumul Damascului republished by Casa »òcoalelor. The latter came out with a set of illustrations by Mina Byck Wepper.Fortunescu, p.375 In 1939, Stamatiad produced his own version of the Chinese poets' anthology, The Jade Flute; it brought together disparate pieces that had seen print in Mihail Sadoveanu's √énsemnƒÉri Ie»ôene review during 1935 and 1936. \\"√énsemnƒÉri Ie»ôene √Æn coresponden»õa fondatorilor\\" , in √énsemnƒÉri Ie»ôene, Nr. 1/2011, p.93 By then, the old Symbolists were losing favor with the modernist youth. His sympathetic reviewer, V. Jeleru, complained in 1943 that \\"Mr. Al. T. Stamatiad no longer seems to be as appreciated as is deserved by the younger writers and readers of poetry. They look upon him with an infantile superiority, even though they only address him publicly as 'maestro'.\\" Stamatiad was in particular adverse to the radical modernist \\"new poetry\\", cultivated by Lovinescu at SburƒÉtorul, and, modernist writer Barbu Brezianu contends, stood on the \\"far right\\" of literature, in a \\"grand conservative party\\" that variously included Sadoveanu, Paul Zarifopol, and D. Nanu. Barbu Brezianu, \\"Curs de literaturƒÉ politicƒÉ\\", in Convorbiri Literare, February 2008 Another young writer, Pericle Martinescu, believed the old but \\"child-like\\" Stamatiad a \\"survivor from another era\\", although he respected his expertise on Wilde's work.Martinescu, p.52-53 This same was noted by C. D. Fortunescu. He called Stamatiad a \\"valuable\\" Wilde translator, but also \\"the unique specimen left around from a vanished type of bohemian Bucharest knighthood\\", with \\"a dated mustache and four-in-hand necktie\\".Fortunescu, p.375, 376 Martinescu visited the Stamatiads at their apartment in the Foi»ôorul de Foc area, near the Greek Church of the Annunciation. Their place, he recalled, was untidy and disappointing, showing that, far from being a free-spirited poet, Stamatiad was \\"riddled with the boredom of family life\\".Martinescu, p.53 The start of World War II brought the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Transylvania's transfer to Hungary, as well as Romania's fascist alliance with the Axis Powers. Stamatiad was grieved and confused by the situation: he organized the Anglophile intellectual circle at Nestor Coffeehouse, but also preached support for Nazi Germany; the Germans, Stamatiad claimed, were to give Romania back \\"all the territories she lost\\". As noted by sociologist Nicolae Petrescu, who was in the audience, Stamatiad was \\"as always, incapable of putting things in perspective\\"; \\"nobody even took his statements seriously.\\"Lucian Boia, Capcanele istoriei. Elita intelectualƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ √Æntre 1930 »ôi 1950, Humanitas, Bucharest, 2012, p.226. In 1941, Ion Antonescu's regime clamped down on the Nestor circle; Stamatiad's colleague »òerban Cioculescu, who was also a member of the National Peasants' Party, narrowly escaped deportation for his involvement in such activities.Raluca Nicoleta Spiridon, \\"Excluderi profesionale √Æn perioada de instaurare a comunismului: destinul criticului literar »òerban Cioculescu (1902‚Äì1988)\\", in Caietele CNSAS, Vol. VI, Issues 1‚Äì2, 2013, p.246-247 A collection of Stamatiad's best poems came out in 1943, at Editura Funda»õiilor Regale, under the title Cortegiul amintirilor (\\"The Cortege of Memories\\"). \\"Vitrina literarƒÉ. Cortegiul amintirilor\\", in Societatea de M√¢ine, Nr. 11/1943, p.172 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Additionally, he worked on translations which reflected the new political trends. Also in 1943, he published E»ôarfe de mƒÉtase (\\"Silk Scarves\\") one of Romania's earliest selections of Japanese poetry.Chelaru, passim; Marcel Mitra»ôcƒÉ, \\"Japan in Romanian Books before World War Two\\", in Acta Slavica Iaponica, Vol. 23, 2006, p.244, 246 Japanese mannerisms had preoccupied Stamatiad for some years, and Peisagii sentimentale comprised some of his own haiku (and, to a lesser degree, senry≈´).Chelaru, p.157 He had unsuccessfully approached Editura Vremea with a collection of tanka attributed to \\"Japanese courtesans\\", possibly loose adaptations of the honkadori format.Chelaru, p.157-158 E»ôarfe de mƒÉtase comprised 200 pieces in indirect translation from French.Chelaru, p.158, 159 It sampled not just haiku and tanka, but also nagauta texts, with highlights from the legendary Susanoo and the historical Ki no Tsurayuki. Some of its modern-era inclusions were Matsuo Bash≈ç, Yokoi Yay≈´, Kobayashi Issa, and contemporaries such as Akiko Yosano and Horiguchi Daigaku.Chelaru, p.159-160 =Final years= Shorlty after the King Michael Coup took Romania out of the Axis, the Romanian Academy awarded him one of the Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu Awards for 1944, in recognition of E»ôarfe de mƒÉtase. His rapporteur was Constantin RƒÉdulescu-Motru, standing in for the recently deceased Pillat.\\"»òedin»õa publicƒÉ de la 3 iunie 1945\\", p.544, 546 Stamatiad's final anthology was a 1945 Din poezia americanƒÉ (\\"Selections of American Poetry\\"). Adrian Marino, \\"Cum citesc americanii literatura rom√¢nƒÉ\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 59, April 2001 His rendition of Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven, originally published by Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, was the only one of 18 such translations to be written in free verse. It therefore bypassed the difficulties of rendering Poe's meter into readable Romanian.Thomas C. Carlson, \\"Romanian Translations of The Raven\\", Poe Studies, December 1985, Vol. XVIII, No. 2, p.22 (digitized by the Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore) By the war's end, and the gradual imposition of a communist regime, Stamatiad was occasionally involved in dialogue with the various ethnic minorities. As noted by writer Ion CƒÉlugƒÉru, Stamatiad was one of the few participants in this effort who were not representing the communist movement.Ion CƒÉlugƒÉru, \\"Jurnal (V)\\", in Caiete Critice, Nr. 9/2012, p.27 In old age, he began a process of minutely recording and cataloging his contacts with other figures on the literary scene, in private notebooks and dossiers. His wife Leti»õia died in 1952. According to writer Gheorghe Grigurcu, who sought his company in November 1954, Stamatiad was living, in noticeable poverty, at his old Foi»ôorul de Foc apartment. Grigurcu also recalls that the aged poet, his personal hero, had trouble breathing and speaking, and could not honor his request for information: \\"Stamatiad was by then a ghostly character, a lyrical hidalgo of yore, returning among us in his unappealing, suffering, stage, his shoulder still held stiff with pride, with a Poesque Raven quothing a barely audible Nevermore.\\" Gheorghe Grigurcu, \\"Fi»ôele unui memorialist\\", in Familia, Nr. 7-8/2009, p.17 Stamatiad reportedly died in December 1955, Eugen Dimitriu, \\"Dimitrie Iov cƒÉtre Leca Morariu\\" , in Convorbiri Literare, 2002 almanac although his death date is often recorded as 1956. Rumor spread in the literary community that he had spent his last months bedridden, helpless against visitors who stole his more valuable possessions. Pavel Chihaia, \\"Pagini de jurnal\\", in Ex Ponto, Nr. 3/2008, p.43 His notebooks were posthumously recovered by researcher Mihai Apostol, who published them, together with Stamatiad's letters, in a 2002 set of volumes. Work CƒÉlinescu describes two sources for Stamatiad's own brand of Symbolism: on one hand, the \\"grandiloquent\\" form of Oscar Wilde, Dimitrie Anghel, »òtefan PeticƒÉ, and a young Ion Pillat; on the other, the \\"euphoric\\" aesthetics cultivated by Macedonski's circle.CƒÉlinescu, p.686, 701-702, 858 Contrary to Stamatiad's nods to Baudelaire, CƒÉlinescu assesses, actual Baudelaireian influences were largely absent from Stamatiad's true work.CƒÉlinescu, p.701 Likewise, Perpessicius ties Stamatiad more to the \\"orator\\" tradition of Macedonski than to any other recognized influence.Perpessicius, p.117-118 Observing such traits, Eugen Lovinescu noted that, despite his use of neologisms, free verse, and other modern devices, Stamatiad was in fact an old-generation Romantic.Lovinescu, p.286-287 Stamatiad's early work is largely focused on amorous themes, often depicting affairs as a struggle of character, or an agony.CƒÉlinescu, p.701; Hane»ô, passim; Lovinescu, p.284-285; Perpessicius, p.118-119 According to Lovinescu: \\"Mr. Al. T. Stamatiad's sensitivity has a short path to follow: a violent outburst, followed by a moral breakdown.\\"Lovinescu, p.284 Unlike his mentor Macedonski, who was \\"saddened by the indifference of his contemporaries\\", Stamatiad \\"expressed the joy of being a Poet\\", of having \\"conquered\\" his place in life. This belief in his own artistic mission, CƒÉlinescu suggests, was \\"illusory\\", leading Stamatiad to invent himself a literary persona and a \\"boisterous\\" love-life; but it also produced \\"a likable psychology\\", with \\"fragments of genuine literary interest\\". He cites as evidence one of Stamatiad's Christian-themed reveries: Stamatiad was more appreciated for his contemplative poems, including the pastel Noapte (\\"Night\\"), seen by Dragomirescu as a small masterpiece.Dragomirescu, p.99, 149 CƒÉlinescu writes that Stamatiad's work comprises mentionable \\"psalms\\": although lacking \\"deep mysticism\\", such poems may unintentionally remind one of Paul Claudel and Charles P√©guy. They earned full praise from Perpessicius, who noted their \\"great simplicity\\" and \\"innocence\\",Perpessicius, p.116 and even from Iorga, who noted their \\"beautiful dedication\\" to war-torn Romania, with echoes from \\"the great Belgian Verhaeren\\". Lovinescu voices a distinct opinion, viewing the psalms as \\"merely a stylistic exercise\\", \\"programmatic\\", \\"in facsimile\\" to the classics of religious poetry.Lovinescu, p.287, 330 The fantasy prose poetry of Cetatea cu por»õile √Ænchise is heavily indebted to Oscar Wilde's \\"gracious infatuation\\", but, CƒÉlinescu argues, is generally humorless. Essentially fables discussing each an archetype (The Gardner, The Three Princesses, The White Deer, The Bird-catcher, Happiness, The White Ghost, The Stonemason), they are described by Fortunescu as a major accomplishment: \\"the poems comprised in this volume display a rare stylistic mastery and verbal richness.\\"Fortunescu, p.375-376 Notes References *\\"»òedin»õa publicƒÉ de la 3 iunie 1945\\", in Analele Academiei Rom√¢ne.

Its main clientele are small business teams, such as start-up companies and small-time entrepreneurs, that need flexible office space solutions. The company currently operates in three cities, Chicago, Philadelphia, and the Washington, DC Metro area. Background The company was founded by Ray Rahbar, Jason Shrensky, Chris Junior and several others in 2012. The idea of an office- sharing start-up was initially conceived in 2007. The idea behind it was for start-ups to have less expenses to incur when creating a fresh company, since buying or leasing an office is a big financial burden for many new businesses. The company was funded by several angel investors, several entrepreneurs and the CYwP Fund. The company opened first an 8,500 square feet shared co-office space at 1401 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Virginia with 25 offices. It was later occupied by 47 tech company startups. This was followed by an office in the Tysons area of McLean, Virginia in June 2013, with 16,000 square feet and 47 offices. The third location was opened in the Dupont Circle area of Washington D.C. with 40,000 square feet, containing 103 offices. In August 2013, United States Senator Mark Warner from Virginia visited the Rosslyn office to talk to tenants and media members about the startup growth in the region. In November 2015, the company changed its name to MakeOffices. In January 2016, MakeOffices expanded into Chicago and opened the first of its 3 coworking and shared office spaces in River North. It also opened in Philadelphia's Center neighborhood at the same time. Service The company offers office spaces that are leased on a month-to-month basis. The advantage of leasing an office space in MakeOffices is that it is less expensive than owning or renting an office space. Also, with a month-to-month rental agreement, companies are not locked into an extensive unbreakable lease, giving startups more flexibility. Executive offices and suites and virtual offices are also available through MakeOffices.

He directed four films: Pudhiya Geethai (2003), Kodambakkam (2006), Raman Thediya Seethai (2008), and En Aaloda Seruppa Kaanom (2017). He made his acting debut with Mayandi Kudumbathar. Career The project was titled Geethai and was set to feature Vijay in the lead role with Esha Deol as heroine. However the film eventually featured two lead actresses with Meera Jasmine being signed on to be a part of the project after the success of her 2002 film, Run. Amisha Patel also accepted to be a part of the film, replacing Deol, after getting the entire script translated in English for her to read. Before release, the film's title was changed to Pudhiya Geethai. The film opened to mixed reviews. The critic from The Hindu stated that \\"the end is predictable, but the conviction with which the climax drives home the message makes it interesting.\\" Another reviewer stated the film had \\"nothing new\\", describing it as \\"real melodramatic soap-opera that moves hearts of viewers and at the same time gives a message for the audience.\\" The film was average at box office. Jagan's third directorial Raman Thediya Seethai was announced in 2007 and the photo session was held at the time of launch. Gajala was selected as one of the leads and Remya nambeesan from Kerala was selected and she joined in second schedule. Vimala Raman of Poi, Karthika Adaikalam of Thoothukudi and Navya Nair were selected since the story needed five heroines Pasupathi and Nithin Sathya were selected to play important roles. Director Jagan said that \\"There are 78 scenes whereas there are 94 locations in the film\\" and added that \\"in most of the scenes there would be a small flashback and if this is taken into consideration then there are more locations in the film rather than scenes\\". Rediff wrote: \\"There's a delicate balance between portraying a genuinely touching story and going overboard with emotions. And that's where Global One Studio Productions' Raman Thediya Seethai (Rama's Hunt for Seetha), directed by Jagannaath, manages to be different\\". Behindwoods wrote:\\"The director needs to be appreciated for delivering a film without kissing or glamorous scenes. However, he could have tried to make the subject a bit more interesting\\". Sify wrote:\\"RTS is riveting cinema and exhibits emotional depth and is a clean feel-good family entertainer\\".

After a career as a museum conservator and teacher in his hometown of Belfort, he joined the French resistance in 1941. Arrested in 1944, he was held in a series of concentration camps where he sketched scenes from camp life. These drawings have been widely used to illustrate the horrors of camp life. Biography Delarbre was born into a family of watchmakers on 30 October 1889, in Masevaux in the Oberelsa√ü(he later commented that he was the grandchild, the child, and the father of a watchmaker.) and jewelers. In 1904 the family resettled in Belfort, in the part of the Haut-Rhin that remained French after the Treaty of Frankfurt (1871). L√©on apprenticed with his father to become a jeweler, and studied the basics of painting. In 1911, Delarbre joined the garrison of Versailles, and took advantage of his proximity to Paris to prepare for entry in the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des arts d√©coratifs and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Admitted to both in 1913, he chose to attend the \\"Arts Decos\\", but simultaneously studied oil painting with R. Collin at the Beaux-Arts. His studies were interrupted by World War I. After demobilization in 1919, he joined with his brother Albert in taking up his father's jewelry business in 1921. Throughout this period he painted and participated in exhibitions. From 1925 to 1933, he collaborated (with Bersier, Conrad, Lecaron, Cochet and Le Molt) in the decoration of the renovated theater in Belfort. In 1929 he became the curator of the Belfort museum, and in 1935 he founded the Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Belfort, where he taught until his death. Among his students was a young Nicolai Michoutouchkine. Too old to be mobilized for World War II, he joined the Volontaires de la Libert√©, a group active in the French Resistance, in 1941. He was arrested on 3 January 1944 while hiding in his sister's apartment with his family; his daughter described the arrest, which took place in front of his children, and how a German Feldwebel tried to comfort her by saying \\"Krieg gross malheur!\\" At first incarcerated in Belfort and Compi√®gne he was deported to Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and Mittelbau-Dora. With the help of friends he managed to procure paper and pencils to depict scenes from the camps, saving the materials by keeping them close to his body while being moved from camp to camp, until he got to Bergen-Belsen, his last stop, where he was liberated by the Allies. The conditions of his environment required Delarbre to forgo his previous interest in drawing landscape, figure and still-life subjects in an academic manner; instead, in a \\"radical and conscious shift\\", he drew the human suffering he witnessed.Jenkins, David Fraser. John Piper: The Forties, 84. New Age International, 2000. On his return to Paris his drawings were acquired by the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris and are now exhibited in the Mus√©e de la R√©sistance et de la D√©portation in Besan√ßon. He returned to Belfort and his position in the museum and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Delarbre became an honorary member of the Salon d'Automne and exhibited every year. He participated in group shows in Belfort, and was honored in 1959 with a retrospective exhibition. In 1953-1954, he did the underpaintings for five new windows in Belfort's Chapelle de la Brasse, and between 1950 and 1960 decorated two kindergartens. He died of heart failure on 20 May 1974 and is buried in the Brasse cemetery in Belfort. Works and legacy Delarbre's sketches made during World War II, now categorized as \\"evidentiary Holocaust artwork\\", are frequently used to illustrate the horror of concentration camps. Delarbre drew on paper scraps and printed ordinances, often interrupting his work in the manufacturing of small arms in order to sketch. He drew labour commandos as they worked or retrieved the dead.Jenkins, 84 Especially notable is his famous drawing of the Muselmann character, a type for the camp prisoners who were doomed to die and had resigned themselves to their fate. Two of his drawings from Dora are in the permanent exhibition at Buchenwald, the camp where he also sketched the so-called Goethe Oak, under whose \\"charred limbs\\" he used to sit and compose verse. The efficacy of his rendering of the horror of the camps is attested to by Jacques Friedel. The Belfort campus of the University of Franche-Comt√© was opened in 1990 and its law school is named for Delarbre; the city of Belfort named a street near the museum for him.

The goal of ISO 45001 is the reduction of occupational injuries and diseases, including promoting and protecting physical and mental health. The standard is based on OHSAS 18001, conventions and guidelines of the International Labour Organization including ILO OSH 2001, and national standards. It includes elements that are additional to BS OHSAS 18001 which it is replacing over a three-year migration period from 2018 to 2021. ISO 45001 follows the High Level Structure of other ISO standards, such as ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015, which makes integration of these standards easier. Development ISO 45001 was proposed at the ISO in October 2013. The committee ISO/PC 283, created in 2013, had direct responsibility for the standardization process. At least 70 countries contributed to the drafting process. Preparation and committee work lasted until December 2015. From 2015 to 2017, a first draft failed to gain sufficient approval from ISO members and was revised in a second draft, which was approved and refined into a final draft. In the final vote, the standard garnered 62 votes in favour, nine abstentions and four votes against from France, India, Spain, and Turkey. The standard was published on 12 March 2018.  Certification  ISO 45001 is set to replace OHSAS 18001 over three years following its publication in March 2018. BSI will formally withdraw BS OSHAS 18001 in March 2021, at the end of the migration period. ISO 45001 uses the management system standard structure guideline Annex SL to allow for simplified integration with other management system standards, such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.

Orbit and classification  This Apollo asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.09‚Äì2.44 AU once every 17 months (521 days; semi-major axis of 1.27 AU). Its orbit has an outstandingly high eccentricity of 0.93 and an inclination of 24¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Due to its orbit, it is also a Mercury-crosser, Venus-crosser and Mars-crosser. It has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of , which translates into 7.1 lunar distances.  Physical characteristics  is an assumed stony S-type asteroid. In October 2014, a rotational lightcurve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Brian Warner at the CS3‚ÄìPalmer Divide Station () in Landers, California. It gave a longer-than average rotation period of hours (most minor planets take 2‚Äì20 hours to complete a full rotation) with a high brightness variation of 1.2 magnitude, indicating a non- spheroidal shape (). Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, measures between 0.5 and 1.2 kilometers. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 0.516 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 18.8.

It contains the village of Kilkishen. The parish is long and up to wide, covering an area of , some of which is covered by lakes. These include Lough Culleaungheeda, Lough Doon, Lough Clonleigh, Clonbrick and Castle-lake. There is a holy well dedicated to Saint Sen√°n of Iniscathy on the edge of Clonlea lake. The ruins of the old parish church, the burial ground, and a penal law sod altar are on the southwest shore of Clonlea lake. The old ruin of Stackpoole overlooks the lakes of Pollagh and Mount Cashel. The parish covers 5,355 statute acres as applotted under the tithe act, mostly mountain and bog.

History Clonlea, Kilseily and part of O'Brien's Bridge (Tr√∫gh) used to comprise the district of Ui Floinn, the land of the O'Flynns. This sept is little known, but there is a mention in MacGrath's Wars of Thormond of the battle of Magh Duine around 953 in which Lachtna, uncle of Brian Boroimhe, slew three of the O'Flynns. The old burial ground is said to contain the remains of one John Cusack, of Kilkishin Castle, who is said to have earned the hatred of the people by acting as a discoverer of the estates of the Catholic gentry. The first church at Kilkishen was probably built very early in the 19th century. It is mentioned in an 1811 report of a dispute that led to violence over who should sit nearest to the altar. As of 1831 the parish had 3,105 inhabitants. In 1841 there were 3,749 in 579 houses. In 1834 there were 3,274 Catholics and 60 Protestants.
