M. in the Subway is a one shot, 53 second-long comedy filmed, and probably directed, by Billy Bitzer on 5 June 1905 at the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company's (AM&B;) studio on 14th Street (Manhattan) in New York City. Likely intended as a slightly racy, and therefore rather typical, subject for AM&B;'s peepshow machine, The Mutoscope, 2 A. M. in the Subway is a vignette of New York City's night life that still resonates with New Yorkers more than a century later. Plot summary A tired cop and a subway conductor are seen waiting at a subway platform, late at night. The conductor opens the doors to the train at left, and out steps an obviously drunk man, played by Sidney Olcott,http://www.sidneyolcott.com/Bio2.htm carried between two women in fancy dress. The cop begins to mix it up with the three of them, and they are interrupted by another man in a bowler hat; he is carrying a large package and steps onto the train to the right after greeting the two women and the drunk man. One of the women steps forward into the frame and lifts up her skirt so that the drunk man can tie her shoe. This gets the attention of the cop, who hustles the three of them onto the train; meanwhile what appears to be a pair of bare legs stick out from a window of a train car and are quickly withdrawn. The cop just manages to notice this, and calls all parties back out to the platform where it is revealed that the man in the bowler hat has a pair of department store mannequin's legs with him. Historical background On May 21, 1905, Billy Bitzer had made his film Interior N.Y. subway, 14th St. to 42nd St. from the front of a New York City Subway car; at that point the Subway itself had been open only seven months. The very day that subject was submitted for copyright, this one was made at the Biograph studio; it was copyrighted on 20 June. Although the six actors involved are unidentified, aside from Sidney Olcott, the action is obviously tightly coordinated in order to get all of the action into such a short subject. AM&B; sent two paper prints of this film for copyright, and the better of the two copies was rephotographed for preservation.http://memory.loc.gov/mbrs/varsmp/0896.mov References External links * Category:American silent short films Category:American films Category:1905 films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American comedy films Category:1905 comedy films Category:1900s short films ","title":"2 A.

It is in the permanent collection of the Royal Academy of Arts in London, it is the only marble sculpture by Michelangelo in Great Britain. A \\"perfect demonstration\\" of his carving technique, the work delivers a \\"powerful emotional and narrative punch\\". Physical history The tondo dates to Michelangelo's time in Florence before his move to Rome in 1505. According to Vasari, while working on his David, \\"also at this time he blocked out but did not finish two marble tondi, one for Taddeo Taddei, today in his house, and for Bartolomeo Pitti he began another... which works were considered outstanding and marvellous\\".\\"et ancora in questo tempo abbozz√≤ e non fin√¨ due tondi di marmo, uno a Taddeo Taddei, oggi in casa sua, et a Bartolomeo Pitti ne cominci√≤ un altro... le quali opere furono tenute egregie e mirabili\\" To the lower right of the back of the relief is a ligature combining the letters L and A, probably the mark of another carver or dealer, and most likely the initials of Lapo d'Antonio di Lapo, active at the Opera del Duomo and for a short period in 1506/7 one of Michelangelo's assistants. A chisel blow on the reverse seemingly from this earlier phase resulted in a hairline crack in the face of the Virgin that may only have become apparent as carving progressed. It is uncertain whether Michelangelo, known for his concern for his materials, was constrained by a shortage of ready alternatives or more accepting of flaws and confident in his ability to work round them after his success with the damaged block for David. The missing segment to the bottom right may be a result of an excess of his celebrated \\"direct attack\\", while the five holes in the outer rim are variously dated and were intended for fixings. In 1568 the tondo was still in the Palazzo Taddei, but by 1678 the family had moved to a new address near San Remigio. At an unknown date the tondo was taken to Rome, where it was acquired from Jean-Baptiste Wicar by Sir George Beaumont in 1822. Initially hung at Beaumont's house in Grosvenor Square, it was bequeathed to the Academy in 1830 and installed at Somerset House, before moving with the Academy to the east wing of the new National Gallery building in 1836, where it remained until the Academy relocated to Burlington House in 1868. It has been housed and displayed in various locations there ever since, except for an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1960. The discovery of the hairline crack running through the upper half of the marble contributed to the decision in 1989 to provide a permanent home for the tondo. Subsequently the tondo was cleaned with dichloromethane swabs and clay poultices to remove residues of nineteenth-century plaster casts and their oil-based release agents, packing materials, traces of beeswax and pine resin adhesives, and other surface accretions. The tondo was left unwaxed and no other coating applied, as the work is not \\"finished\\" and was not originally polished. Since the opening of the Sackler Wing of Galleries in 1991, the tondo has been on free public display in a purpose-built area on the top floor, positioned for reasons of preventive conservation behind protective glass, to combat the effects of air pollution and the possibility of vandalism. Description The tondo as a format for painting and relief sculpture was a quintessential product of the Florentine Renaissance. For a century from around 1430 all the leading artists, including Filippo Lippi, Botticelli, Luca Signorelli, Piero di Cosimo, Fra Bartolomeo, Andrea del Sarto, Leonardo da Vinci (in a lost work), and Raphael, painted tondi. In the same few years that Michelangelo executed his only panel painting documented in contemporary sources, the Doni tondo, he sculpted the Pitti and Taddei tondi - but he did not return to the form. The tondo depicts a seated Virgin Mary with the baby Jesus dynamically sprawled across her lap, turning and looking back over his right shoulder towards the infant Saint John the Baptist, who stands before him looking down and holding a fluttering bird. Compositionally, the eye of the viewer is drawn diagonally along Christ's body, back up that of his mother, with her gaze across to John, and from his face back to Christ. John, patron saint of Florence, with his attribute of a baptismal bowl, crosses his arms, perhaps in allusion to the cross. Most likely it is a goldfinch not a dove that he holds - Christian symbolism sees in this bird a representation of the Passion \\\\- the piece of marble below might then have been intended as a crown of thorns. Executed with only a point and claw chisel, often driven hard and with great energy, the combination helps create a sense of \\"surface unity\\" unbroken by the use of the drill. The Christ child in full relief is highly finished, the shallower relief of the Virgin finished to a lesser degree, St. John more so again, while the background is roughly executed. These marked variations in texture help establish the relative status of the three figures while creating a sense of compositional depth all the greater for not being more conventionally \\"finished\\". Many of Michelangelo's works are unfinished. According to nineteenth-century French sculptor and critic Eug√®ne Guillaume, Michelangelo's \\"non finito\\" was \\"one of the master's expressive devices in his quest for infinite suggestiveness\\". Reception and influence Taddeo Taddei was patron and friend of Raphael, who studied and reworked the tondo in two drawings, the versi of The Storming of Perugia in the Louvre and of compositional studies for the Madonna del Prato at Chatsworth House. Raphael returned to the twisting body of the Christ child stretching across his mother's lap in the Bridgewater Madonna. Shortly after its arrival in England, the tondo was sketched by Wilkie, who wrote to Beaumont \\"your important acquisition of the basso-relievo of Michael Angelo is still the chief talk of all our artists. It is indeed a great addition to our stock of art, and is the only work that has appeared in this northern latitude to justify the great reputation of its author\\". Cockerell noted in his diary how \\"the subject seems growing from the marble & emerging into life. It assumes by degrees its shape, features from an unformed mass, as it were you trace & watch its birth from the sculptor's mind\\". Shortly after its arrival at the Royal Academy, the tondo was sketched by Constable, who published a letter in the Athenaeum of 3 July 1830 praising the way it was lit, \\"showing the more finished parts to advantage, and causing those less perfect to become masses of shadow, having at a distance all the effect of a rich picture in chiaroscuro\\". With its differing degrees of finish the tondo is an outstanding technical study piece; plaster casts may be found at the Victoria and Albert Museum and Fitzwilliam Museum.

It is now located in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The construction is made of anorthosite gneiss, (related to diorite) a valuable, extremely hard, and dark stone brought 400 miles down the Nile River from royal quarries. This highlights Khafre's importance and power as a ruler. The statue was carved for the Pharaoh's valley temple near the Great Sphinx, a part of the necropolis (a funerary city) used in funeral rituals. This Old Kingdom statue has an important function in Egyptian tombs as substitute abodes for the Pharaoh's ka‚Äîthe life force that accompanied a person with a kind of other self. After death, the ka leaves the body into the afterlife, but still needs a place to rest: the statue. This sculpture, depicted in-the-round (versus relief sculpture) shows Khafre seated, one of the basic formulaic types used during the Old Kingdom to show the human figure.Van Keuren, Dr. Frances. \\"ARHI 3000: Ancient Art.\\" MyWeb. Office, Visual Arts Building, East Campus, N324, n.d. Web. 14 Nov 2010. <> Mummification played a huge role in the Egyptian culture, a 70-day process to ensure immortality for the pharaoh. Starting in the 3rd millennium BCE, if the pharaoh's mummy was damaged, a ka statue was created to \\"ensure immortality and permanence of the deceased‚Äôs identity by providing a substitute dwelling place for the ka\\".Kleiner, Fred S. Gardner's Art Through the Ages Western Edition. Thirteenth. 1. Cengage Learning, 2008. 62-63. Print. Khafre rigidly sits in his royal throne, gazing off into the distance. The pharaoh wears a linen nemes headdress, which cover most of his forehead and folds over his broad shoulders. This royal headdress depicts the uraeus, or cobra emblem, on the front along with the royal false beard attached at the end of his chiseled chin, all symbols which exemplify his royalty and divinity. Khafre wears a kilt covering his waist, revealing his idealized upper body and muscle definition. This depiction is not a portrait, but a symbol of Khafre's power through using the artistic conventions of Egypt‚Äîa flawless body, perfectly un-aged face, and ideal body proportions. The Egyptian idealized portraiture is not meant to record individualized features, but instead proclaim the divine nature of Egyptian kingship. Two stylized lions‚Äô bodies form the throne Khafre sits on, creating a sturdy base. Lotus plants (symbolic of Upper Egypt) and papyrus plants (symbolic of Lower Egypt) grow between the legs of the throne, referring to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt which ended the Egyptian Pre-Dynastic period. The god Horus, depicted as a falcon, protects the backside of Khafre's head with his wings, another reference to the united Egypt.Davies, Penelope J.E. (2007). Janson's history of art: western tradition, 7/e . Pearson. Besides the striking view of the falcon (unseen from the front) resting behind Khafre's head, Khafre's feet are emplaced upon a flat platform, engraved with 9-archery bows, representing the king's and kingdom's dominance over foreign/domestic enemy tribes, the nine bows. The symmetrical pharaoh shows no movement or change, suppressing all motion and time to create an eternal stillness; his strong build and permanent stance demonstrate no notion of time‚ÄîKhafre is timeless, and his power will exist even in the afterlife. The pharaoh has an emotionless and ageless face, alluding to his non-chaotic, controlled empire and powerful leadership; the pharaoh has control over his domain. The statue is based upon compactness and solidity with few projecting parts; Khafre's block-like body is attached to the throne to last for eternity, creating one single structure. His arms rest on his thighs, directly facing the viewer in a rigid, frontal pose. The bilaterally symmetric statue, symbolizing order and control in the pharaoh, is the same on either side of the vertical axis of the statue, only differing in Khafre's clenched right fist. The tight profile and block-like aspect represent Khafre as a permanent being and part of the stone to keep his ka safe. Khafre will always exist, on earth and in the afterlife. The pharaoh's sculpture can be described as absolutely frontal, utterly immobile, and perfectly calm: the characteristics of Egyptian block statue.Dobbins, John. \\"Egyptian Art.\\" Intro to Art History. University of Virginia. Charlottesville, VA. 13 Sept 2010 - 24 Nov 2010. Lecture.  Creating Khafre Enthroned  In order to create this sculpture in-the-round, the sculptor used the subtractive method. He began with a cube-shaped stone block of diorite. First, the sculptor drew the front, back, and two profile views of Khafre on the four vertical faces of the stone. After the sketched plans were made, the sculptor chiseled away the excess stone on all four sides until the plans came together, meeting at right angles. The last step was sculpting specific details of Khafre's body and face, carving the falcon god Horus, and other designs on the throne. The subtractive method allows the sculptor to create a block-like look for Khafre's ka statue, a standard for Egyptian sculpture during this time period. In addition to the subtractive method, abrasion, rubbing or grinding the surface was used to finish the product off. The diorite statue stands at a final height of five foot six.  Khafre Enthroned in Context with the Funeral Procession  Funerary Complex Khafre's ka statue, which would have been located in the Valley temple of Khafre, was only one part of an extremely intricate system used in Egyptian funerary rituals. Located at the Pyramids of Gizeh, the necropolis included the Valley Temple of Khafre, a mortuary temple, the Great Sphinx, and a causeway leading to the pyramid of Khafre. The Great Pyramids of Gizeh (Pyramids of Giza), located on the outskirts of present-day Cairo, are three enormous pyramids for three Egyptian pharaohs with multiple smaller ones, housing the mummies of the royal family and nobles. From largest to smallest, the pyramids of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure are the most famous and dedicated to each god, respectively. Khafre's pyramid and tomb were designed as an eternal home for his mummy, where the serdab (chamber room) in the Valley Temple was meant to keep his ka statue. Unlike previous pyramids, such as the Stepped Pyramid of Djoser designed by the first known architect Imhotep, the Great Pyramids of Gizeh were not based upon the mastaba structure, a rectangular structure. The new, smoothly inclined surface of the tomb derives from a rectangular base, which is aligned by the four cardinal directions of the compass. The four sides finish at a pointed tip, referring to the emblem of the sun Re (Ra), called the ben-ben. These symbolic pyramids allowed the pharaoh's spirit to ascend to the heavens using the rays of the sun. The funeral procession carrying the pharaoh's mummy began east of the Nile River, where the sun is reborn every morning and where the Egyptian citizens live. Khafre's mummy would have crossed the Nile River, which was the ribbon of life separating the east from the west. The Nile was extremely important in Egyptian culture, for it provided fertility of the land and represented life for the people who used it. Because of its importance and symbol of life, it was used as part of the procession to bury the pharaoh. Khafre's body would then meet at the west side of the Nile, or the land of the dead. Every night, the sun sets and dies, which is why the western section of the city was dedicated to burying the dead. The horizontal axis of east to west was symbolic to the Egyptians, representing the cycle of life and eternalness of their leaders; every day the sun is born in the east and dies at night in the west, yet is again reborn in the east the next morning. The rhythm of the horizontal axis used in the funeral procession parallels with eternalness of the pharaoh. Once on the west bank of the Nile, Khafre's mummy would travel along the causeway, or pathway, passing by the Valley Temple of Khafre where the Khafre Enthroned statue would be located. Next along the causeway is the Great Sphinx, a creature with a Pharaoh head and cat body carved out of the living/natural rock of the area. Many believe that the face of the sphinx is actually Khafre, further honoring the Pharaoh in the funeral procession. Continuing along the causeway, the mummy and procession enter the Mortuary Temple of Khafre adjoining the pharaoh's pyramid. This is where offerings were made to the deceased pharaoh and further ceremonies performed. Sealing the mummy in the tomb of Khafre's pyramid, where his body and ka would peacefully rest for eternity, completed the funeral ritual.

It was later released in cartridge form by XYPE, a group of Atari 2600 homebrew developers.  Gameplay  Oystron is an action game in which the player controls a ship using the joystick controller, firing at enemies and collecting pearls dropped by \\"space oysters\\". The player's ship initially appears on the left side of the screen, and enemies attack from the right. Shooting the space oysters reveals a pearl; the player then collides with the pearl and brings it to the \\"pearl zone\\" on the left side of the screen. Other enemies appear that attempt to steal the pearls. Collecting eight pearls earns the player a bomb. At the end of each level, a boss named \\"Oystron\\" appears; the player can defeat the Oystron by placing a bomb in its path, or waiting until it changes into a space oyster. Following the appearance of the Oystron is a warp phase, in which the player travels at high speed and must avoid colliding with enemies. The player is given four ships at the beginning of a game, and earns an additional ship every 4000 points.  Reception  In 2003, Oystron was one of several Atari 2600 homebrew titles selected by Activision for inclusion in the Game Boy Advance version of their Activision Anthology. In 2005, it was named one of the five \\"Best 2600 Homebrew Games\\" in the book Gaming Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools by Simon Carless, who praised the game's fast pace, sprites and color scheme.

Sohn formerly served as the Chief of Facilities of the Los Angeles Unified School District Facilities Division (LAUSD), having been appointed by the Superintendent Ramon C. Cortines.. LAUSD news release proclaiming the hiring of James Sohn as Chief of Facilities LAUSD is the 2nd largest school district in the United States. The Facilities Services Division oversees all maintenance and operations, including the construction and modernization program. The bond program is the largest school construction program in the United States, with more than five voter approved bond measures totaling $20.6 billion coupled with billions in matching funds from the State of California. Bond audit and amounts listed in Treasury Office  Education  James Sohn holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Berkeley; a Master of Business Administration from University of Phoenix, and a Master of Arts from King's College London. He is a LEED accredited professional, licensed general contractor in the state of California and a member of the London-based think tank, International Institute of Strategic Studies.  Tenure at Los Angeles Unified School District  James Sohn initially worked as a consultant at LAUSD prior to becoming a Senior Project Manager for Robert F. Kennedy Community Learning Center. This is considered the largest, most expensive school ever built in the United States, at a cost of over $578 million. Robert F. Kennedy School Cost The school is located on the site where Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot and killed in 1968. It can hold 4,200 students and includes a manicured public park, swimming pool and fine art murals. He returned to LAUSD in July 2009 as a Deputy Chief of Facilities, eventually replacing the previous Chief of Facilities, Guy Mehula. Mehula was criticized for the use of expensive consultants. Daily News article referring to the departure of Guy Mehula On January 25, 2011, the Facilities Services Division under James Sohn released $531 million in additional funds due to savings from decreased construction costs as a result of the downward economy and from reserve funds that were previously unavailable. Some questions were raised as to the priorities of the projects funded but many long-identified but unfunded projects were ultimately approved via the board action on January 25, 2010. Union officials continue to protest as to why bond district employees were laid off when additional funding is currently available. One of James Sohn's priorities was the use of renewable energy. On February 10, 2011, LAUSD officials gathered at Canoga Park High School to celebrate the activation of a 273-kilowatt (kW), 896-solar-panel system on the school's rooftops. Sohn's goal is to achieve 21 megawatts of power in the next three years installing solar panels in various schools. Projections show that this will save approximately $112 million in utility costs over 20 years. At the helm of the school construction program at LAUSD, Sohn introduced numerous efforts at reforming the school construction program by consolidating numerous departments, laying off hundreds of consultants and district employees and slashing consultant rates by 20%. Board Report 253, detailing 20% rate reduction However, a limited review audit by LAUSD's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found issues with some of these reforms. Daily News discussing OIG audit This includes costs that exceed pre-approved amounts by 50% and additional contracts worth $31 million without school board approval. These contracts were amended to correct the issues the OIG identified. OIG Audit and James Sohn‚Äôs Response The OIG found that in some cases the 20% reduction in rates was later amended for a subset of consultants back to their original rates. The report also found that the consultant rate multipliers were changed from 1.8 to 1.98 during negotiations. Daily News discussing cancelled contracts The OIG report also showed a $40,000 initiation fee for one of the consultant contracts. Following this report, Superintendent Cortines canceled $3.7 million in contracts cited in the OIG report, including the contract that included the initiation fee but left open the possibility the consultants may return. An audit by the Los Angeles City Controller, Wendy Greuel, showed that prior to 2006 there was a lack of controls and that a potential existed for conflict of interests to occur regarding consultant use at the LAUSD Facilities bond program, but noted that: \\"from 2006 to the present day the district has undergone a dramatic improvement and has done a good job ensuring the integrity of the selection process.\\" Press release from Los Angeles Controller office The City Controller has been criticized for not releasing the names of the individuals cited in the audit. Daily News article regarding LA Controller Audit of LAUSD James Sohn introduced a new contract type, called Agency Construction Manager (Agency CM), which offers many benefits, including maximizing consultant services, lower costs, increased productivity and increase small business competition (see Construction Management). LAUSD BOC Meeting Agency CM is an attempt to replace the old consultant model of billing for an hourly rate in favor of a lump sum task order. Task orders (Job Order Contracting) are designed to provide payment for completion of a particular task, regardless of the number of hours worked. Criticisms with this include the lack of adequate tracking of consultant employees, difficulty in comparing district to consultant staff, and contracts which were cited in the OIG report as vague in detail. During his tenure at LAUSD, the district halted a cleanup effort of draft and outdated electronic versions of documents. Daily News article about purging of file systems After Teamsters union complaints, LAUSD halted this practice. During Sohn's tenure at LAUSD, there were ongoing issues with budgets and layoffs, brought on by California's continuing budget situation. Teamsters officials have complained about layoffs within facilities of their members. Regular Board Meeting, February 9, 2010 and November 12, 2010 (November not posted yet) - Connie Oser addressing Board regarding consultants Teamsters Representative Connie Oser stated that district staff have been removed while consultant contracts continued to be approved by the Board, consultant employees moved between companies, and that the use of Agency CM causes the tracking of consultants to be difficult. Superintendent Ramon Cortines and Chief of Facilities James Sohn have both stated that consultants have been reduced in far greater numbers than district staff. A protest by Teamsters was held on February 9, 2010, in reference to Board of Education Report - 253 - 09/10, which include 40 consultant contracts which were approved by the Board, totaling $65 million worth of bond funds. Board Report - 253 Teamsters complained district employees, many of whom perform similar or same work responsibilities, were being laid off rather than consultants. Teamsters claim this is in violation of California Education code 45308, which state ‚Äúclassified employees shall be subject to layoff for lack of work or lack of funds.‚Äù Ed Code 45308 During the Board meeting to discuss BOE-253 - 09/10, Superintendent Cortines pushed for the approval of the consultant contracts, against the wishes of Board member Yolie Flores, who wanted more time to discuss. Board members who approved BOE-253 - 09/10 were Monica Garcia, Richard Vladovic, Tamar Galatzan and Nury Martinez. Board member who voted no were Steve Zimmer. Board member Yolie Flores abstained and Marguerite LaMotte was absent. A former LAUSD Construction Department employee, Bassam Raslan, employed before James Sohn's tenure as Chief, but who remained until 2010, was arrested and indicted by a grand jury for conflict of interest charges. LA Times article regarding arrest of Bassam Raslan Bassam pleaded guilty to one count of conflict of interest. LA Times - Bassam pleads guilty = Construction safety = James Sohn would work to increase the speed of DSA approved projects. On September 14, 2010 the Board of Education approved a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Division of State Architect (DSA) that would provide up to 8 million dollars to fund a DSA Certification pilot program that sought to relieve the backlog of DSA Certification files backlog that has developed over the last 12 years of construction. Even with this pilot program approved, construction delay, quality and safety would continue to plague LAUSD. A few months after the MOU, The Division of State Architect warned the district that cutbacks made to Inspector positions at LAUSD construction sites could affect \\"safety and quality\\" of schools and the district would be held liable. The district had laid off 37 out of 112 state-certificated inspectors in December 2010. Daily News article referring to shortage of inspectors The layoffs were based on projections that would later be deemed incorrect. = Resignation = James Sohn resigned from LAUSD on March 15, 2011. LA Times James Sohn  Tenure at Los Angeles Community College District  James Sohn served as the head of the Program Management team for the Los Angeles Community College bond program from July, 2007 to June, 2009. With more than $6 billion to modernize its nine colleges, the Los Angeles Community Colleges (LACCD) Sustainable Building Program is one of the nation's largest green construction efforts, with 87 buildings expected to meet LEED‚Ñ¢ (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards. The District has received numerous awards for its environmentally responsible construction projects. Most of the program's funding comes from bond measures that were approved by voters in 2001, 2003 and 2008. After James Sohn's tenure at LACCD, an audit by Capstone Advisory Group LLC, Capstone Award showed bond funds being used on items that Capstone did not deem appropriate uses of bond funds. Press Release regarding creation of a whistle-blower protection program and additional spending controls It called for a whistle-blower protection program and new stringent financial controls. The recommendations were released after he had left LACCD for LAUSD, but referenced the years during James Sohn's tenure as the head of the Program Management team for the LACCD bond construction program(2007‚Äì2009), as well as prior and subsequent years. A special Los Angeles Times report on the Los Angeles Community College bond program documenting waste, building quality, delays, cost overruns, nepotism and other issues was released on February 27, 2011. LA Times six part story on LACCD Bond Waste LA Times Part 1 LA Times Part 2 LA Times Part 3 These issues included complaints from faculty regarding quality issues affecting some of the completed buildings, buildings which were completed later than their original schedule, concerns whether or not the green energy initiatives would recoup their investment, consultant billing rates, lack of external citizen oversight, lack of an OIG, and construction contracts which were cancelled after work began due to budget shortfalls. The Valley Health and Science Center, mentioned in the series, would win the Western Council of Construction Consumers 2009 Distinguished Project Award.

It occurred on July 22‚Äì25, 1950, in the village of Yongdong in southern South Korea. The newly arrived US Army 1st Cavalry Division was ordered there to cover the retreat of the US 24th Infantry Division after the Battle of Taejon. The 1st Cavalry Division soldiers, however, were untried in combat, and the North Korean Korean People's Army's (KPA) 3rd Division was able to outmaneuver them and force them back. Though the Americans lost the town, their artillery inflicted substantial casualties on the North Koreans and delayed them for several crucial days, allowing the United Nations Command time to set up the Pusan Perimeter.  Background  = Outbreak of war = Following the invasion of South Korea by North Korea, the United Nations committed troops to the conflict in support of South Korea. The United States sent ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and preventing South Korea from collapsing. However, US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II in 1945, and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army, which was headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Regardless, the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea. US Forces retreat during the Battle of Taejon The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial \\"shock\\" of North Korean advances, delaying much larger KPA units to buy time to allow follow-on forces to arrive. The division's delaying actions allowed the 7th Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division, and other Eighth Army supporting units to move into position. Republic of Korea Army (ROK) forces in the meantime were systematically defeated and forced south along Korea's east coast, with entire divisions being overrun by the KPA's superior firepower and equipment. Advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5, during the first battle between American and KPA forces. For the first month after the defeat at Osan, 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the KPA's superior numbers and equipment. The division's regiments were systematically pushed south in battles around Chochiwon, Chonan, and Pyongtaek. The division made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon and was almost completely destroyed, but delayed KPA forces from advancing until July 20. By that time, the Eighth Army's combat troops were roughly equal to KPA forces attacking the region at around 70,000 for each side, with new UN units arriving every day. = US 1st Cavalry Division arrival = The 1st Cavalry Division arrives at P'ohang-dong. On July 6, Major General Hobart R. Gay, Commanding General of the 1st Cavalry Division, was ordered by UN commander General Douglas MacArthur to prepare the 1st Cavalry Division to move into Korea. Between July 12 and 14 the division was moved from its garrisons in central Honshu, Japan and loaded onto ships in the Yokohama area. It was then ordered to land on the east coast of Korea at P'ohang-dong, a fishing town northeast of Pusan, in order to immediately reinforce the faltering 24th Infantry Division. From P'ohang-dong the division could moved promptly toward the Taejon area. The command ship and first elements of the division sailed for Korea on July 15. The 1st Cavalry Division's transportation was provided by Task Force 90, commanded by Rear Admiral James H. Doyle. Lead elements of the division's first regiment, the 8th Cavalry Regiment were ashore by 06:10 on July 18, and the first troops of the division's US 5th Cavalry Regiment came in at 06:30. Typhoon Helene swept over the Korean coast and prevented landing of the third regiment, the 7th Cavalry Regiment and the 82nd Field Artillery Battalion until July 22. For three days ships could not be unloaded at Pusan and Eighth Army rations dropped to one day's supply. However, the landings were entirely unopposed by North Korean forces. The transfer of 750 noncommissioned officers (NCOs) from the 1st Cavalry Division to the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions, a move aimed at strengthening the infantry divisions combat missions in Korea, had weakened the 1st Cavalry Division. It had been stripped of practically every NCO except the first sergeants of companies and batteries in the division. Even though it had received 1,450 replacements before it left Japan, 100 of them from the Eighth Army stockade, the division was understrength when it landed in Korea and, like the preceding divisions, it had only two battalions in its three regiments, two firing batteries in the artillery battalions, and one tank company with M24 light tanks. On July 19, the 5th Cavalry Regiment started toward Taejon. The next day the 8th Cavalry Regiment followed by railroad and in trucks, and reformed in an assembly area east of Yongdong that evening. Brigadier General Charles D. Palmer, the division artillery commander, took charge of these two forward regiments. On July 22 the 8th Cavalry Regiment relieved the US 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division from its positions at Yongdong. At that point, the 1st Cavalry Division assumed responsibility for blocking the KPA along the main Taejon‚ÄìTaegu corridor to Pusan. The 24th Division's troops retreated through the 1st Cavalry Division's lines as the newly arrived soldiers advanced to their new defensive positions that day. Once it was fully assembled in the city, the 1st Cavalry Division was ordered to move north of Yongdong and set up defensive positions. The division moved one battalion of the 8th Cavalry northwest of Yongdong on the south side of the Kum River, and another battalion southwest of Yongdong. The first would cover the approach along the main Taejon‚ÄìTaegu highway, the second the approach on the Chosan- ni‚ÄìMuju‚ÄìKumsan road. Gay placed the 5th Cavalry Regiment on the high ground east of the town in a blocking position. By July 19, the division numbered 10,027 men in Korea. This move coincided with a reorganization of the ROK consolidating their lines and making room for the new division. On July 22, the 1st Cavalry Division had finished preparing its defensive positions north of Yongdong, as the battered 24th Infantry Division was moved to the Naktong Bulge area along the Naktong River. At the same time, the 25th Infantry Division moved to Sangju where it was caught in a battle with KPA forces in that town.  Battle  = Opening moves = The KPA quickly advanced after the Battle of Taejon, with four of their divisions attacking south from the city along four different roads. The KPA 3rd Division departed the city on July 22, advancing down the main highway toward Taegu and Yongdong, to where the 1st Cavalry Division was emplaced. The next morning, July 23, the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, in front of Yongdong, reported it had destroyed three KPA T-34 tanks with 3.5-inch rocket launchers in its first use of that weapon. On July 23 the 7th and 9th Regiments of the KPA 3rd Division began their attack on the Yongdong defensive positions held by the 1st Cavalry Division. They made their first penetration southwest of Yongdong, establishing a roadblock behind the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, and at the same time other KPA units heavily engaged the 1st Battalion northwest of Yongdong in frontal attack. The next day, American M24 tanks attacked the roadblock behind the 2nd Battalion four times in an attempt to break it, but all were unsuccessful, and Lieutenant Colonel Eugene J. Field, the 2nd Battalion commander, was wounded at the roadblock. Palmer sent the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment and the 16th Reconnaissance Company toward the cut-off battalion. By 12:00, KPA troops were attacking the 99th and 61st Field Artillery Battalions which were supporting the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, indicating that the KPA infiltration had been extensive by that point. = Fighting on the roads = On the other main approach to Yongdong, a road northwest of the city, heavy machine gun fire and 37-mm fire from A Battery of the 92nd Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion, and artillery fire from the 77th Field Artillery Battalion helped the 1st Battalion there to repel KPA attacks. However, the large numbers of civilian refugees crowding the Yongdong area trying to move south helped the KPA infiltrate the 1st Cavalry Division's positions. Eighth Army tried to control the refugee movement through the Korean National Police, permitting it only during daylight hours and along predetermined routes. Rumors continued to spread of civilian-clad North Korean infiltrators, and orders came down to fire on approaching refugees.Seven miles east of Yongdong, 7th Cavalry Regiment troops opened fire on a large refugee group, killing many in what became known as the No Gun Ri massacre. The South Korean government-funded No Gun Ri Peace Foundation estimated in 2011 that 250‚Äì300 were killed in the three-day-long slaughter, mostly women and children. By the morning of July 25 KPA forces had infiltrated the positions of the 1st Cavalry Division so thoroughly that they were disrupting its lines of supply, and Gay ordered the division to withdrawal and re-form its lines further south. Northwest of Yongdong, 1st Battalion executed an orderly withdrawal, covered by the fire of the Heavy Mortar Company and the two batteries of the 77th Field Artillery Battalion. The mortar operators fought as infantry in the withdrawal. During these retreats KPA troops disguised themselves as refugees and would form roadblocks in the UN troops' rear areas, or used hidden communications equipment to inform higher commands of UN concentrations so those concentrations could be attacked when they were most vulnerable. Meanwhile, the KPA intensified their attack on the 2nd Battalion on the road southwest of Yongdong. Concentrated artillery support, with the shells falling so close to the 2nd Battalion positions that they wounded four US troops, together with an attack by the 2nd Battalion, briefly opened the KPA roadblock at 04:30 July 25, and the bulk of the battalion escaped to Yongdong. However, F Company of the 8th Cavalry, the 16th Reconnaissance Company, and the 1st Platoon of A Company, 71st Tank Battalion, at the rear of the column were cut off. Only four of 11 light tanks broke through the KPA positions. Crews abandoned the other seven tanks and walked over the hills in a two days' journey as part of a group of 219 men, most of them from F Company. All equipment except individual arms was abandoned by this group. Other groups of US troops escaped in the same manner. The KPA had flanked the 1st Cavalry Division in a double envelopment and forced them to withdraw. In the process, the division lost much of its equipment in its quick withdrawal actions. On this same road, closer to Yongdong, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, which was trying to help the cutoff units of the 8th Cavalry, was itself attacked by strong KPA units. Through some error, the US battalion's F Company advanced to the wrong hill and stumbled into a concentration of KPA soldiers. Only 26 men from F Company returned, the rest were killed or captured in the subsequent ambush. Altogether, the 5th Cavalry Regiment suffered 275 casualties on July 25. = American withdrawal = The KPA 3rd Division used essentially the same tactics it employed against the 24th Infantry Division at Taejon against the 1st Cavalry Division at Yongdong. In both fights, the KPA opened with a direct frontal attack to hold the US division's elements in combat, and then the bulk of the KPA force enveloped the American left flank and established strongly held roadblocks behind the front positions and forced the Americans in them to retreat from the untenable positions. The KPA 3rd Division entered Yongdong the night of July 25. At least one KPA unit was in the town by 20:00. The KPA expected a counterattack and immediately took up defensive positions at the eastern edge of the town. However, the US troops had withdrawn. The 1st Cavalry Division troops set up another delaying action around Hwanggan and hit the KPA advance a second time in the Battle of Hwanggan several days later.  Aftermath  North Korean prisoners of war captured by the US troops during the battle reported that the KPA 3rd Division suffered about 2,000 casualties, mostly from artillery fire, in the attack on Yongdong on July 24‚Äì25. This brought it down to a strength of about 5,000 men, approximately half the strength it had when the war began. The 1st Cavalry Division's actions were able to delay the KPA advance for several days, giving the UN forces valuable time to set up the Pusan Perimeter. The UN losses after this battle and the subsequent fight at Hwanggan cost the 1st Cavalry Division 916 casualties. The defeat was a poor showing for the division, but its record quickly improved with experience and it became a more reliable fighting unit by the time it was placed on Pusan Perimeter.

Established in 1960, the Nevada City Classic commonly occurs on Father's Day and brings in thousands of visitors to Nevada County. While the first race brought out approximately 1,500 spectators, the numbers have swelled to 15,000 spectators in recent years. Sponsored by the Nevada City Chamber of commerce, the schedule includes Women's, Junior's, and Master's races, in addition to the Men‚Äôs main event. Past winners include Greg LeMond. Course The 90-minute race includes 40 laps on a twisty and hilly circuit with over 300 feet of climbing. The course, basically unchanged since its advent, is considered by experts to be the toughest one-mile criterium in the United States. History Established in 1960, the Nevada City Classic is the largest and oldest bicycle race on the West Coast, as well as the second-oldest bicycle race in the country. It was initiated by Charlie Allert, a native of Dresden, Germany, who had been a bicycle racer and master lithographer before arriving in Nevada City by way of San Francisco. With a course laid out by Allert, the first race was held on Father's Day 1961. The 1961 and 1962 races were won by Bob Tetzlaff, a Los Gatos school teacher. Starting in 1963 when he was 18 years old, Bob Parsons from Pasadena won the race the next five years. John Howard won in 1970. Greg LeMond was the winner for the three consecutive years of 1979-81 and he was subsequently honored when the Nevada City City Council proclaimed August 11, 1986 as \\"Greg LeMond Day\\". Todd Gogulski (1986, 1988), Scott Moninger (1994, 1997, 1999, 2006), Alexi Grewal (1993), and Levi Leipheimer (1998) also took the top spot. Having participated in the race 19 years earlier, Lance Armstrong returned in 2009, and won using illegal drugs and methods, and has been disqualified with the result voided It was hailed at the time as the first victory of his comeback as it preceded his return to the Tour de France. Ian Boswell was the winner in 2010. In 1997, the race was designated a National Classic Pro Points Race, and thirteen years later, in 2010, its course became the starting point of the Stage 1 of the Tour of California.

Zonis contends that as the Shah's core psychological relationships failed in the 1970s he regressed into his essential passivity and dependence, making him incapable of facing the challenge from the Iranian Revolution. The main sources of the Shah's psychic support that maintained his psychic equilibrium were the admiration of his subjects, several friendships dating from childhood, a belief in special divine protection, and his alliance with the U.S. government.Marvin Zonis, Majestic Failure:The Fall of the Shah (University of Chicago Press:1991), pp.20-21.

He concluded that the longer members of this elite group of 300 participated in the Shah's political system, the more likely they were to exhibit attributes of insecurity, cynicism, and mistrust.The Political Elite of Iran (Princeton University Press, 1971), pp.3-17.Amazon.com: THE POLITICAL ELITE OF IRAN: Marvin Zonis: Books References External links *http://www.MarvinZonis.com/ *https://web.archive.org/web/20110128150756/http://kimchimatters.com/ *http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/bio.aspx?person_id=12826030080 *https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/busecon/busfac/Zonis.html *http://www.diamondconsultants.com/PublicSite/people/team/?topic=Diamond%20Fellows&name;=Marvin%20Zonis * Diamond Management & Technology Consultants *http://investor.cna.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=104503&p;=irol-govhighlights *https://web.archive.org/web/20110707093449/http://www.agencyforspeakers.com/espeakers/3506/Marvin- Zonis.html Category:Living people Category:American University people Category:American economics writers Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:Harvard Business School alumni Category:Yale University alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Marvin Zonis"},{"id":"29617066","text":"Sugar Grove is an unincorporated community in Schuyler County, Illinois, United States.

Mount Bessan, whose name means \\"Separate Mountain,\\" received its name because it is slightly separated from the south side of Mount Haku. To the south of Mount Bessan is a small flat area called the Bessan Plain (Âà•Â±±Âπ≥ Bessan Hira) and Lake Mitarashi (Âæ°ÊâãÊ¥óÊ±† Mitarashi Ike). Near the lake are the ruins for the Bessan Room (Âà•Â±±ÂÆ§ Bessan-ya), which was used as a rest house for those making the pilgrimage up the mountain. Geography Though Mount Haku, the main peak in the Ry≈çhaku Mountains, was created by an active stratovolcano, Mount Bessan is made up of sedimentary rock.

He was born in 1713, the eldest son of Charles Willoughby, 14th Baron Willoughby of Parham and Hester, daughter of Henry Davenport of Little Lever and Darcy Lever, near Bolton. Hugh Willoughby's father died on 12 June 1715, aged 34, and the infant Hugh Willoughby became the 15th Baron Willoughby of Parham. He could not take his seat in the House of Lords until he reached the age of 21. Life Hugh Willoughby was born in Lancashire around 1711, he resided at Shaw Place Health Charnock. After his father's death Hugh Willoughby was placed under the joint guardianship of his mother and Reverend John Walker, the Presbyterian minister of Horwich chapel of ease. His mother, Hester Willoughby married James Walton of Wigan in 1717, soon after the death of her first husband, and under the terms of his will, forfeited joint guardianship. On his father's death Hugh Willoughby was below the age of majority and was placed under the guardianship of Rev. John Walker, a Presbyterian minister. His mother, Ester daughter of Henry Davenport of Little Lever and Darcy Lever, Bolton had remarried to James Walton of Wigan in 1716, soon after the death of Charles Willoughby, 14th Baron Willoughby of Parham her late husband. Under the terms of her late husband's will she forfeited joint guardianship.Hugh Lord Willoughby, a neglected society president, P.J.W Higson p. 170 In 1717 Hugh Willoughby commenced school at Rivington Grammar School then a newly rebuilt school erected 1714. The school was governed by local non-conformists. Hugh Willoughby in his early years attended the Rivington Unitarian Chapel. In this period Rivington Grammar school was having difficulty finding a non- conformist head master and it is believed this led to Hugh Willoughby being transferred to a Non conformist school at Taunton, Somerset where he met a lifelong friend Israel Mauduit, the political pamphleteer. In 1732 he received the freedom of Dumfries in Scotland.Hugh, Lord Willoughby, a neglected society president, P.J.W Higson p. 170 His half brother John Walton attended the Glasgow University in 1736 and during the adult life of Hugh Willoughby all the Ministers at the Rivington Unitarian Chapel were from that University. His mother Ester Walton was interred at Horwich Parish Church 16 Jan 1761. Succession In 1733, Hugh Willoughby was challenged by a rival claimant to the peerage, Henry Willoughby, descendant of Sir Ambrose Willoughby,The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, 1876, Henry Fritz-Gilbert Waters p. 68 and the case was referred to the Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Sir Philip York (later Lord Hardwicke) championed Hugh Willoughby's cause. As Henry Willoughby awaited his hearing, Hugh Willoughby spent his time travelling in Europe, his absence prevented the case being heard. However, on his return the case from Henry Willoughby was still not attended to by Hugh Willoughby or the Attorney General.Hugh, Lord Willoughby, a neglected society president, P.J.W Higson p. 171 Hugh Willoughby gained a writ of summons to the House of Lords and took his seat on 1 February 1734, despite a caveat: his rival's petition was read to the house. House of Lords In his first year, he attended the Lords without missing a session. In the years 1735 to 1739, he was noted for his non-attendance, then after 1742 attended without fail. In addition to his duties in the Lords he was elected Vice-President of the Royal Society in 1752 and President of the Society of Antiquaries in 1754. Other positions included Vice-President of the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts, Trustee for the British Museum and a Commissioner on the Board of Longitude. From 1758 until 1762 he was governor at Rivington Grammar School and was a trustee of Blackrod Grammar School from 1736 although he did not attend meetings. He aided the foundation of the Warrington Academy. Hugh Willoughby chaired a committee of the House of Lords a year after taking his seat. Philip Yorke wrote that Willoughby was \\"eminently useful in the dispatch of the ordinary business\\" of the Lords, and \\"had a thorough and accurate knowledge of the forms and usage of Parliament\\". He played a significant role in committee work between 1739‚Äì40. In 1758, with twenty years' continuous experience, he took over the position of Chairman of Committees of the House of Lords on a temporary basis following the illness of the 8th Earl of Warwick.House of Lords Record Office, The Origin of the Office of Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords, page 4 By 12 November 1759, he was the permanent Chairman of Committees, a position he held until his death. During his lifetime he had served 58 times as Chair of Committees and served on 227 select committees.House of Lords Record Office, The Origin of the Office of Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords, page 5 In 1744 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and served as their vice-president on two occasions. Death Monumental Inscription of 15th Lord Willoughby of Parham, Horwich Parish Church Hugh Willoughby died without issue on 22 January 1765 in London.

Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz. 1916. Oil on canvas, 81.3 x 54.3 cm. Art Institute of Chicago. Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz is a 1916 oil on canvas painting by Amedeo Modigliani. It depicts Modigliani's friend, the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz, standing alongside his seated wife Berthe. Modigliani and Lipchitz had each moved to France at a young age, were both from Jewish backgrounds, and became close friends who frequented the same artistic circles in Paris.Norton Simon Museum Despite their commonalities, there were marked differences: Lipchitz exemplified artistic industriousness while Modigliani was given to bohemian dissolution.A Study in Irony: Modigliani's Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz Before painting Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz Modigliani made a series of preparatory drawings, of which five survive: two of Lipchitz, two of Berthe, and one of them together in the resolved composition.Mann, 104-106 Lipchitz described the painting's development years later: Lipchitz was uncomfortable accepting the painting for merely ten francs, and made excuses in order for Modigliani to continue working on the portrait. \\"You know\\", I said, \\"we sculptors like more substance.\\" \\"Well,\\" he answered, \\"if you want me to spoil it, I can continue.\\"Lipchitz, 16 The portrait occupied Modigliani for nearly two weeks, \\"probably the longest time he ever worked on one painting.\\"Lipchitz, 16 Amedeo Modigliani. Bride and Groom, 1915. The subjects of Modigliani's other double portrait appear to be \\"character puppets\\", whereas Jacques Lipchitz and his wife are \\"transformed into human beings\\".Schmalenbach, 39 One of only two double portraits painted by Modigliani, Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz has been noted for its complex and enigmatic study of contrasting personalities. Lipchitz is shown with his wife Berthe Kitrosser, a Russian poet, in their Paris apartment that had previously been the home of the sculptor Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. Posed in front of an abstracted architectural interior, Lipchitz is handsomely dressed, and stands casually with one hand on Berthe's shoulder. Their mask-like faces have encouraged varied readings; Berthe's gentle sensuality, her large eyes and lips and graceful neck, have been seen to offer a striking contrast to Lipchitz's self-pride, his small eyes and mouth and \\"wickedly twisted nose\\" combining to satirical effect. For art historian and curator Mason Klein, Berthe's face is bland and bourgeois, her frilly collar and pert nose suggesting haughtiness, while Lipchitz stands above her, domineering and protective.Klein, Mason, et al, 11 Modigliani biographer Werner Schmalenbach compared Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz to the artist's Bride and Groom of 1915, and noted the development away from a purely formal depiction of 'types' to a greater interest in the characterization of individuals.Schmalenbach, 39 This difference in the two works is consistent with an evolution in Modigliani's drawing and painting toward increased refinement.Schmalenbach, 39 After Modigliani died in 1920 Lipchitz crafted his death mask, making twelve plaster molds for Modigliani's friends and family.Lipchitz, 20 Soon thereafter Lipchitz traded the painting to his dealer in exchange for the return of sculptures \\"which I no longer felt were representative.\\"Lipchitz, 16 The painting was purchased in 1922, and entered the Art Institute of Chicago in 1926 as part of the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection.

Needle had its Australian TV Premiere on Saturday 12 December 2015 on Channel ONE (Network TEN). Director John V. Soto credits influences from such horror and mystery films as Hellraiser, Urban Legend, and I Know What You Did Last Summer.  Plot  Ten years ago, a man on a phone call is killed gruesomely by someone after the person at the other end of the line accused him of stealing an important archaeological artifact. A woman and a child, presumed to be the murdered man's family comes rushing in to his aid. Present time, at St. Mary's College, Ben Rutherford (Michael Dorman), a college student, inherits a strange looking mechanical box called Le Vaudou Mort from his father, who had died two years earlier. That night, he decides to show the box to his best friend Ryan (Nathaniel Buzolic), a girl, Mary (Tahyna Tozzi), who has romantic feelings for Ben, lesbian couple Kandi (Jessica Marais) and Isabel (Trilby Glover) and two other friends Nelson, a school paper photographer (Luke Carroll) and Jed (Khan Chittenden). Before leaving, Nelson takes a group photo. Morning comes and Nelson wants to photograph the mechanical box to advertise it, thinking it must be worth a great fortune. Ben reluctantly agrees but to his dismay, the box has gone missing. Ben asks Mary if she \\"borrowed\\" it (because they were the last two to see the box), but Mary denies his allegations. Nelson and Ryan decide to ask their Archaeology professor, Professor Banyon (Jane Badler), about the box. She reveals that it was used as a theatre prop and nothing else, but will alert them if she has any information. That night, during a run through school, an unknown person is seen cutting out Ryan's face from the picture Nelson took and then inserting it into the Le Vaudou Mort indicating that it was actually stolen by someone. Suddenly, the lights around the school start exploding, frightening Ryan, who runs out of the school into the woods. The unknown person then pulled out a wax figure from the Le Vaudou Mort resembling Ryan and started slashing the figure with heated up needles. Ryan, in reality started to bleed to death when gushes appeared on his body. When the police found his body the next day, Ben's brother Marcus (Travis Fimmel), (who he is not in good terms with because Ben blamed him for their father's death two years ago due to a car crash after their misunderstanding), was the crime scene photographer and immediately recognized Ryan. He went to tell Ben about it. The next night, Nelson, who was still affected by Ryan's death, went wall climbing. The unknown person then cut Nelson's face from the photo and inserted it in the Le Vaudou Mort. Nelson's wax figure came out and the unknown person started to rip out the limbs. In reality, Nelson was killed when he was dismembered gruesomely. Ben found out about Nelson. Mary and Kandi decided to have a wake in Isabel's house for their friends. Before Ben went, he was called by Professor Banyon and was introduced to another Archaeology expert Dr. Halmanay (Igor Sas) and told him that the Le Vaudou Mort was in fact a revenge apparatus. At the wake, Kandi was having a breakdown so they decided to leave. Suddenly, Professor Banyon called Ben saying it was urgent and he needed to go. Marcus and Ben went to discover more about the Le Vaudou Mort. Kandi decided to pick up some drinks and drop Mary home and Jed went to the game house. Alone at the house, Isabel went to swim when the unknown person decided to victimize her next, doing the exact thing as with the others. The killer then stabbed needles in the figure's eyes, killing Isabel in reality. Marcus and Ben went to Professor Banyon's office only to find her dead with her head beaten severely. Having finished their research, they found out that their father, Samuel Rutherford (James Hagan) stole the Le Vaudou Mort from his friend Robert Shaw (Michael Loney) ten years ago. The two brothers then concluded that whoever the person doing the killing was, wanted revenge on their father, thus passing the revenge in his sons and their friends. They headed back to Isabel's house to warn their friends only to find her body. Kandi, who was driving back home and seemingly was able to drop off Mary, came upon Jed. She decided to give him a ride too. Marcus and Ben went to their old neighborhood as they found out it was where Robert Shaw died. Ben decided to stay outside as Marcus went in with his photographer issued hand gun. He found the Le Vaudou Mort and was rendered unconscious by someone. Outside, Mary's mother called Ben's cell phone informing him that Mary has not yet reached home. After the conversation, Ben spotted Kandi's car and found Jed's body with a slit on his mouth ear to ear. Ben went inside to warn Marcus only to be knocked out by Kandi, who was in fact the killer. Kandi, who was actually Robert Shaw's daughter, wanted revenge on Ben's family. It is revealed that the man earlier was Robert Shaw, being killed by Samuel Rutherford (Ben and Marcus' father). She explained that she wanted Ben to feel what she felt when her father died for nothing, thus killing his friends first to prolong the agony. Marcus was unconscious on the floor and Mary was held captive. Ben was held at gunpoint. Kandi then began to put Mary's picture in the La Vaudou Mort and she began to poke her wax figure. Ben was able to stop Kandi from continuing but Kandi dragged Ben outside the house and planned to slash his throat with a knife. Mary freed herself and Marcus. Mary then cut Kandi's face in the picture and began to do the wax figure. As Kandi was about to kill Ben, holes appeared in her chest implying that Mary has successfully gave Kandi a taste of her own medicine. Kandi died as flashbacks of her friends' deaths go through her head. Marcus and Mary went out to Ben's aid. One month later, Marcus and Ben finally made up and hung around on Marcus' boat from which he inherited from his father. They decided to throw the Le Vaudou Mort into the ocean so that no one will be victimized by it again.

Background It is estimated that 11 to 12 million people in India stammer. Stammering is a physiological disorder. The World Health Organization classification of stuttering (stammering), in the section \\"Mental and behavioural disorders\\", is F98.5, where the definition is given as \\"Speech that is characterised by frequent repetition or prolongation of sounds or syllables or words, or by frequent hesitations or pauses that disrupt the rhythmic flow of speech. It should be classified as a disorder only if its severity is such as to markedly disturb the fluency of speech.\\" However, as there is a shortage of good speech therapists in India, speech therapy is highly expensive, and the government of India does not officially recognise the condition as a handicap. Formation International Stuttering Awareness Day Ribbon TISA grew out of a Yahoo group started on 3 April 2001 by an Indian PWS, Viren Gandhi. By late 2010 the group had 576 members, contributing almost 6000 posts on issues including speech therapy reviews, self-help ideas and emotional support. Some members of the group met in person for the first time in Mumbai on 13 April 2008. They decided to start a self-help association, to be named The Indian Stammering Association. TISA started a blog on 9 May 2008. This blog was the first Indian blog on stammering in open public internet space, unlike chat groups, which required registration and were open primarily to people who stammer.https://groups.yahoo.com/group/IndianPWS There had been other parallel and/or preceding attempts by Indians to seek and offer help with stammering. Inspired by Keith Boss, a trustee of the British Stammering Association and board member of the International Stuttering Association, a small group of Indians started an internet group. One Indian PWS contributed to International Stammering Awareness Day in 2006 and another attended the world congress in Croatia in 2007. A group in Chennai had been meeting under the statute of Mahatma Gandhi on the Marina Beach from 2001. The Samagra Trust also helped TISA in its formative years, by publishing a booklet on stammering among other things. The Indian Stammering Association launched its official website on 15 August 2009. It was formally registered as Public Charitable Trust Number 6055 on 13 November 2009. The trust's head office is located at Herbertpur, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India. Activities The trust has conducted self-help workshops, based on acceptance, breathing techniques and CALMS approach in various Indian cities. A model of the workshop is freely available on the internet. TISA promotes self-help groups in different cities, has made available a self-help manual that combines the modern approach to stammering with eastern concepts of self-acceptance, and produces a newsletter. TISA is also participating in genetic research in stammering in India. TISA organised a three-day National Conference at IHS, Bhubaneshwar (31st Dec 2011 to 2nd Jan 2012). Twenty five participants from different parts of the country learned from each other, shared their experiences and did sight seeing. Dr Satya Mahapatra and Dr Elaine Robin from National Stuttering Association (USA) gave the inaugural address and shared their wisdom with the participants over the three days. =Self-help groups= Groups are open to those taking speech therapy from any source, and are facilitated by a volunteer PWS. This facilitator offers the opportunity to practise communication skills in a group setting, offer and receive counseling, and gain information on techniques and therapists. TISA regards the optimum number of participants for a SHG to be no more than 12. There is no minimum number. Cities with TISA self-help groups include Bangalore, Mumbai, Surat, Jammu, Herbertpur, Goa, Pune, Delhi, Chennai, Dehradun, Meerut, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Ludhiana and Ahmedabad.Mathai, Kamini TISA Chennai Chapter inaugurated!, quoted in The Times of India, 21 January 2009. Accessed 22 November 2010. TISA's self-help communication workshops last from 3‚Äì10 days, depending on the participants' needs and availability of time. These workshops are based on Acceptance: Even though I stammer, I accept myself whole heartedly, because there is an inner perfection in me. Breathing techniques based on Pranayama are introduced as an aid to relaxation and to a speech driven by belly breathing. Western techniques are also incorporated and the four techniques, adapted from a book by Peter Reitzes, among other sources. Accepting and serving other PWS is an important concluding theme in the workshop. Some participants have started their own self-help groups after the workshop. =Advocacy= In October 2010 TISA filed a public interest writ petition against the director and producers of the film Golmaal 3 and the censor board of India at Uttarakhand High Court. It objected to the film's portrayal of stammerers as objects of ridicule, on the grounds that this promoted discrimination and the teasing and bullying of people who stammer.Bhatti, Sharin, Golmaal 3 sued, Shreyas Talpade shocked! . Hindustan Times, 18 November 2010. Accessed 21 November 2010. The film-makers and Censor Board have to respond to the court notice by 14 December 2010.

Instead of emphasizing the personalities of great historical leaders, as in the conventional approach, it concentrates on socio-cultural developments. History as \\"historical social science\\" (as Wehler described it) has mainly been explored in the context of studies of German society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The movement has published the scholarly journal ' since 1975. Social history developed within West German historiography during the 1950s‚Äì60s as the successor to the national history discredited by National Socialism. The German brand of \\"history of society\\"‚ÄîGesellschaftsgeschichte‚Äîhas been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. Modernization theory was presented by Wehler and his Bielefeld School as the way to transform \\"traditional\\" German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few \\"great men,\\" into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. Wehler drew upon the modernization theory of Max Weber, with concepts also from Karl Marx, Otto Hintze, Gustav Schmoller, Werner Sombart and Thorstein Veblen.Roger Fletcher, \\"Recent Developments in West German Historiography: the Bielefeld School and its Critics.\\" German Studies Review 1984 7(3): 451-480. Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte (1987‚Äì) is Wehler's comprehensive 5-volume history of German society in the eighteenth-twentieth centuries. Each volume approaches historical processes from a social history perspective, organized under the themes of demographics, economics, and social equality. His detailed structural analysis of developmental processes supported by a vast body of notes and statistics sometimes obscures the larger context. Nonetheless, patterns of continuity and change in the social fabric are emphasized. More than a historiographical synthesis of Ranke and Marx (envisioned by some German historians after the catastrophe of World War I), Wehler's work incorporates Max Weber's concepts of authority, economy, and culture and strives toward a concept of \\"total history.\\" Volumes 1‚Äì2 cover the period from feudalism through the Revolution of 1848. Volume 3 Von der \\"Deutschen Doppelrevolution\\" bis zum Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges 1849‚Äì1914 (1995) employs Wehler's longtime emphasis on a German Sonderweg or \\"special path\\" as the root of Nazism and the German catastrophe in the twentieth century. Wehler places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s‚Äì1870s, when economic modernization took place, but political modernization did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service. Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernizing society. Recognizing the importance of modernizing forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus). Wehler's Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte: Vom Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges bis zur Gr√ºndung der Beiden Deutschen Staaten 1914‚Äì1949 (2003) is the fourth volume of his monumental history of German society. The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernization of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's fourth volume is his treatment of \\"the middle class\\" and \\"revolution,\\" each of which was instrumental in shaping the twentieth century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of \\"charismatic domination,\\" which focuses heavily on Adolf Hitler. The fifth volume will extend to 1990; none of the series has yet been translated into English.A partial summary appears in Hans-Ulrich Wehler, The German Empire, 1871‚Äì1918 (1997) Challenges British historian of Germany Richard J. Evans disagreed with the Bielefeld school regarding the Sonderweg thesis. Instead he argued for the roots of Germany‚Äôs political development in the first half of the twentieth century in a \\"failed bourgeois revolution\\" in 1848. Influenced by the New Left, Evans was a member of a group of young British historians who in the 1970s sought to examine German history in the Imperial period \\"from below.\\"Theodore S. Hamerow, \\"Guilt, Redemption and Writing German History\\" The American Historical Review, February 1983, Volume 88#1 pages 53‚Äì72 quote on page 70. In 1978, as editor of a collection of essays by young British historians entitled Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany, he launched a critique of the \\"top-down\\" approach of the Bielefeld School. Evans and the others wanted a perspective from the Left that stressed the importance of the working class by highlighting \\"the importance of the grass roots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people.\\"Evans, \\"Introduction: Wilhelm II's Germany and the Historians\\" in Evans, ed. Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany (1978) pages 22‚Äì23 Along with historians Geoff Eley and David Blackbourn, Evans emphasized the \\"self-mobilization from below\\" of key sociopolitical groups, as well as the modernity of National Socialism.See Evans, In Defence of History, (2002) =Cultural turn= From the 1980s, however, the Bielefeld school was increasingly challenged by proponents of the \\"cultural turn\\" for not incorporating culture in the history of society, for reducing politics to society, and for reducing individuals to structures. Historians of society inverted the traditional positions they criticized (on the model of Marx's inversion of Hegel). As a result, the problems pertaining to the positions criticized were not resolved but only turned on their heads. The traditional focus on individuals was inverted into a modern focus on structures, the traditional focus on culture was inverted into a modern focus on structures, and traditional emphatic understanding was inverted into modern causal explanation.Chris Lorenz, \\"'Won't You Tell Me, Where Have All the Good Times Gone'? On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Modernization Theory for History.\\" Rethinking History 2006 10(2): 171-200. Kocka responded by arguing that social history has become so all-pervasive that it has lost its position as the cutting edge within historiography. He says, \\"But: in the meantime social historians' approaches, viewpoints, topics and results have been accepted and incorporated by many other historians who would not call themselves social historians. Social history has successfully penetrated its opponents.\\" He expects to see a return to social history, this time with more cultural and linguistic elements.Cited in Magn√∫sson, (2006) Studies from Bielefeld School * Kocka, J√ºrgen.

Description The ancient theatre (the teatro greco, or \\"Greek theatre\\") is built for the most part of brick, and is therefore probably of Roman date, though the plan and arrangement are in accordance with those of Greek, rather than Roman, theatres; whence it is supposed that the present structure was rebuilt upon the foundations of an older theatre of the Greek period. With a diameter of (after an expansion in the 2nd century), this theatre is the second largest of its kind in Sicily (after that of Syracuse); it is frequently used for operatic and theatrical performances and for concerts. The greater part of the original seats have disappeared, but the wall which surrounded the whole cavea is preserved, and the proscenium with the back wall of the scena and its appendages, of which only traces remain in most ancient theatres, are here preserved in singular integrity, and contribute much to the picturesque effect, as well as to the interest, of the ruin. From the fragments of architectural decorations still extant we learn that it was of the Corinthian order, and richly ornamented. Some portions of a temple are also visible, converted into the church of San Pancrazio, but the edifice is of small size.

Younger infuses classical, jazz, soul and funk influences to the harp tradition pioneered by her predecessors and idols Dorothy Ashby and Alice Coltrane. Younger leads her own ensemble, performs as a soloist and has worked as a sideman for such musicians as Pharoah Sanders, Jack DeJohnette, Charlie Haden, Bill Lee and Reggie Workman, and other popular artists including Lauryn Hill, John Legend (Love in the Future), Common (Finding Forever), Ryan Leslie, Drake, Maxwell, The Roots, Moses Sumney and Salaam Remi. Younger is noted for her work with saxophonist Ravi Coltrane, who was featured on her latest release, Soul Awakening. Currently, she actively records and tours with drummer and producer Makaya McCraven, following the release of his 2018 recording Universal Beings.  Current features  In April 2019, Younger's original composition \\"Hortense\\" was featured in the documentary Homecoming, by Beyonc√©.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10147546/soundtrack The recording used was from an NPR Music Field recording released in 2013.https://www.npr.org/2013/06/06/189069622/brandee-younger-taxidermy-two- headed-skeletons-and-jazz-harp Also in the spring of 2019, Younger was selected to present a spotlight performance on the second night of Quincy Jones' \\"Soundtrack of America\\",Soundtrack of America the series opening of The Shed in NYC, curated by Steve McQueen and Quincy Jones himself. She was also featured in the series opening concerts, alongside Kelsey Lu and performed a feature with Moses Sumney. Her original work is also heard in the 2018 HBO TV series Random Acts of Flyness, by filmmaker and director, Terence Nance.  Early life  Brandee grew up in Hempstead, NY and Uniondale, NY and began her harp studies as a teen under the tutelage of Karen Strauss. She received further instruction from harpists Rebecca Flannery, Susan Jolles, Emily Mitchell and bassist Nat Reeves. Younger went on to earn undergraduate degrees in Harp Performance and Music Business from The Hartt School of the University of Hartford. While there, she was mentored by the faculty of the Jackie McLean Institute of Jazz and African American Studies. Nate Chinen of The New York Times noted that \\"Ms. Younger quickly found a kinship with Hartt's jazz program, run at the time by the august alto saxophonist Jackie McLean. He told her to drop by whenever she wanted. 'So I did,' she said.\\"Nate Chinen, \\"Brandee Younger, a Harpist Finding Her Way to Jazz\\", The New York Times, February 29, 2016. Entering New York University for graduate school six months later, she had already established an impressive r√©sum√©, having joined the harp faculty at the Hartt School Community Division, opened for Slide Hampton as a member of Hartford-based collective The New Jazz Workshop and developed a working relationship with Grammy-nominated producer and artist Ryan Leslie and Grammy Award-winning producer Omen. Building upon that foundation, Younger began working with saxophonist Ravi Coltrane on a series of concerts honoring the music of the late pianist, organist and harpist, Alice Coltrane. Younger is the cousin of urban farmer and MacArthur Fellow Will Allen. She is also the cousin of Jordan Younger, cornerback of the Toronto Argonauts.  Career  Over time, Younger has built her career as an educator, concert curator, performer and bandleader of the Brandee Younger Quartet. Her debut EP Prelude was released in June 2011, having been recorded in an analog studio with Dezron Douglas, E.J. Strickland and vocalist Niia. The original standout track \\"So Alive\\" was later featured in the Mercedes Benz Mixed Tape compilation; the track was lauded by Mercedes Benz as \\"...a compelling soul jazz composition, in which all instruments are melded to a haunting universe centered around Niia's celestial voice. Beguiling musical subtlety in these times of loudness.\\" As a classical musician, Younger has been featured as a soloist with The Harlem Chamber Players, and has performed with the Hartford Symphony Orchestra, Waterbury Symphony, Soulful Symphony, Ensemble Du Monde, Camerata New York and the Red Bull Artsehcro, a \\"non-conformist\\" orchestra. Younger was selected to be a 2013 Harlem Arts Festival artist and performed at Marcus Garvey Park at the Richard Rodgers Amphitheater that year. In hip hop and R&B;, Younger has worked with Common, Drake and John Legend to name a few. Younger has released three other recordings as a leader, including the EP Prelude, released in 2011, Live At The Breeding Ground, released in 2014, and Wax & Wane from 2016. Since the 2011 debut of her Prelude EP, Younger released Brandee Younger Live @ The Breeding Ground, a breakthrough performance on Blue Note Records and Revive Music's 2015 Supreme Sonacy Vol. 1 LP, and the more recent release of her critically acclaimed 2016 Wax & Wane LP. An independent artist, Younger has self-managed throughout the entirety of her career. She arranged and performed a track for Impulse Records' 2018 release A Day In The Life: Impressions of Pepper - a tribute to the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,A Day In The Life: Impressions of Pepper and she has performed on the Tonight Show with The Roots and producer Salaam Remi. In August 2020, Younger contributed to the live streamed recording of the singer Bilal's EP VOYAGE-19, created remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. It was released the following month with proceeds from its sales going to participating musicians in financial hardship from the pandemic.  Work as an educator  Younger is on the teaching artist faculty (harp) at New York University.https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/brandee-younger She has taught at Adelphi University, Nassau Community College, The Hartt School Community Division at the University of Hartford and also maintains a rigorous schedule as a private instructor. She has lectured and conducted masterclasses at The Royal Conservatory of Music (Toronto), University of Birmingham (UK), Howard University, Drexel University, Princeton University, Trinity College, Berklee College of Music, The Hartt School, Elyrica Summer Music Program, Connecticut Valley Harp Intensive, NOLA Jazz & Pop Festival and she also serves as Symphonic and Jazz Harp Artist in Residence at the Cicely L. Tyson Community School of Performing and Fine Arts. Recent residencies include intensives at Michigan State University, DePaul University, Tulane University.  Awards and titles  In 2020, Younger was awarded \\"Player of the Year in Instruments Rare in Jazz\\" by the Jazz Journalists Association.https://www.jjajazzawards.org/p/2020-winners.html The same year she was named winner of the DownBeat critics poll in the category of \\"Rising Star\\" harpist.https://downbeat.com/news/detail/carrington-tops-2020-downbeat- critics-poll She also was featured on Downbeat magazine's July 2020 cover along with Dezron Douglas and six other artists.https://downbeat.com/magazine/2020-07 Younger has received a handful of bylines for Revive Music and Harp Column Magazine and holds several leadership positions as a member of the Apollo Young Patrons Steering Committee, and Vice President of the Metro NYC and Long Island Chapters of the American Harp Society. She also serves as Director At Large of the American Harp Society, Inc. Stepping away from traditional venues to bring live performance to alternative spaces, in 2016 Younger served as curator of the weekly Harp On Park lunchtime concert series \\"highlighting the diversity of the harp and the contemporary importance of an ancient instrument\\" and in 2019, curated Her Song, highlighting the works of women composers for Arts Brookfield. In 2017, she curated Divine Ella, a concert dedicated to the legacy of Ella Fitzgerald as part of the historic Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture's annual Women's Jazz Festival.Divine Ella Brandee is among the musicians included in the book The New Face of JazzCicily Janus, The New Face of Jazz: An Intimate Look at Today's Living Legends and the Artists of Tomorrow, Billboard Books, 2010. by author, Cicily Janus, \\"Freedom of Expression: Interviews With Women in Jazz\\", by Chris Becker and was also featured in the Impulse Artist Series' \\"Alter Ego Series\\"[5] in November 2010, a young artist series created by classical pianist Jade Simmons.  Soul Awakening  Surfacing six years after its completion in 2013, this eight- track collection was recorded in 2012 under the direction of producer and bassist Dezron Douglas, and embodies the ambition, vigor and aesthetic ideals of The Brandee Younger Quartet, at and since its inception. A benchmark recording that captures the group's collective brilliance in its infancy, Soul Awakening is a synthesis of the people, places and moments that impacted Younger most, ahead of the album's creation. The very first album recorded by the ensemble, Soul Awakening, marks the birth of Younger's artistic signature and the reemergence of the harp as a pillar of modern popular music. Younger and Douglas, alongside drummer E. J. Strickland and saxophonists Stacy Dillard and Chelsea Baratz, enlist a who's who of featured collaborators to best translate their ethos. In doing so, Soul Awakening becomes a full circle release for Younger that combines her band with two of her greatest mentors: saxophonists Antoine Roney and Ravi Coltrane. Other notable contributors include drummer Chris Beck, trumpeter Freddie Hendrix, trumpeter Sean Jones, and vocalist Niia. Soul Awakening received a positive critical response. Nate Chinen of NPR stated: \\"In terms of both production value and musical substance, it feels like an artifact of our moment: celestial, groove-forward, unabashed about its alchemies of style.\\" Briana Younger of the New Yorker wrote: \\"Her radiant playing is as cogent on hip-hop and R&B; albums as it is set against classical and jazz backdrops.\\" \\"The new album came about after Ms. Younger performed a tribute to Ms. Ashby commissioned by the Revive Music Group. She connected with Casey Benjamin of the Robert Glasper Experiment, who produced 'Wax & Wane' with a contemporary flair. 'Afro-Harping,' which in Ms. Ashby's original 1968 version feels dialed in to hippie frequencies, sounds on the new album like a post-Dilla instrumental, a remix in real time.\\" - Nate Chinen/New York Times  Discography  =As leader= *2011: Prelude, Independent *2014: The Brandee Younger 4tet, Live at the Breeding Ground, Independent *2015: Supreme Sonacy, Blue Note Records / Revive Music *2016: Wax & Wane, Independent/ Revive Music *2018: A Day In The Life: Impressions of Pepper, Impulse! *2019: Soul Awakening, Independent =As sideman/contributor= *2006: Cassie, Cassie *2007: Finding Forever, Common *2008: In This Day, E.J.

He is an instructor at the Indian Military Academy (IMA). =Controversy= In March 2013, a Supreme Court judicial commission ruled the killing of cousins Gobind and Nobo Meitei in the Langol area of Imphal to have been a staged encounter. The killings took place on 4 April 2009, and involved a joint team of local police and a unit of 39 Assam Rifles commanded by Kumar. While official statements from the paramilitary forces were that the cousins had opened fire when challenged and had been killed in response, the judicial panel concluded that based on medical evidence and witness testimonies, the action was \\"not an encounter but an operation by the security forces wherein death of the victims was caused knowingly\\". Referring to the encounter, in which 89 rounds were fired at the pair, Kumar was reported as saying the encounter had been genuine, and that his understanding was \\"when a person is warned by the security forces and if he reacts by firing, such a person is a hardcore terrorist.\\" On 14 July 2017, the Supreme Court directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a probe into several extrajudicial killings in Manipur, including the case in which Kumar was implicated.

A Divine Council is an assembly of deities over which a higher-level god presides. Historical setting The concept of a divine assembly (or council) is attested in the archaic Sumerian, Akkadian, Old Babylonian, Ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Canaanite, Israelite, Celtic, Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman and Nordic pantheons. Ancient Egyptian literature reveals the existence of a \\"synod of the gods\\". Some of our most complete descriptions of the activities of the divine assembly are found in the literature from Mesopotamia. Their assembly of the gods, headed by the high god Anu, would meet to address various concerns.Sakenfeld, Katharine ed., \\"The New Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible\\" Volume 2, pg 145, Abingdon Press, Nashville. The term used in Sumerian to describe this concept was Ukkin, and in later Akkadian and Aramaic was puhru.Freedman, David N. ed., \\"The Anchor Bible Dictionary\\" Volume 2 pg 120, Doubleday, New York Examples =Archaic Sumerian= One of the first records of a divine council appears in the Lament for Ur, where the pantheon of Annunaki is led by An with Ninhursag and Enlil also appearing as prominent members. =Akkadian= The divine council is led by Anu, Ninlil and Enlil. =Old Babylonian= In the Old Babylonian pantheon, Samas (or Shamash) and Adad chair the meetings of the divine council. =Ancient Egyptian= The leader of the Ancient Egyptian pantheon is considered to either be Thoth or Ra, who were known to hold meetings at Heliopolis (On). =Babylonian= Marduk appears in the Babylonian En√ªma Eli≈° as presiding over a divine council, deciding fates and dispensing divine justice. = Canaanite = Texts from Ugarit give a detailed description of the Divine Council's structure of which El and Ba'al are presiding gods. = Hebrew/Israelite = The Council of Gods, Giovanni Lanfranco (1582‚Äì1647), Galleria Borghese Loggia di Psiche, ceiling fresco by Raffael and his school (The Council of The Gods), Villa Farnesina, Rome, Italy, by Alexander Z., 2006-01-02 In the Hebrew Bible, there are multiple descriptions of Yahweh presiding over a great assembly of Heavenly Hosts. Some interpret these assemblies as examples of Divine Council: The Book of Psalms (), states \\"God (◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥÷î◊ô◊ù Elohim) stands in the divine assembly (◊ë÷∑÷º◊¢÷≤◊ì÷∑◊™-◊ê÷µ◊ú ‚ÄòƒÉ·∏èa·πØ-‚Äô√™l); He judges among the gods (◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥÷î◊ô◊ù elohim)\\" (◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù ◊†÷¥◊¶÷∏÷º◊ë ◊ë÷∑÷º◊¢÷≤◊ì÷∑◊™÷æ◊ê÷µ◊ú ◊ë÷∞÷º◊ß÷∂◊®÷∂◊ë ◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù ◊ô÷¥◊©÷∞◊Å◊§÷π÷º◊ò). The meaning of the two occurrences of \\"elohim\\" has been debated by scholars, with some suggesting both words refer to Yahweh, while others propose that the God of Israel rules over a divine assembly of other Gods or angels. Some translations of the passage render \\"God (elohim) stands in the congregation of the mighty to judge the heart as God (elohim)\\" (the Hebrew is \\"beqerev elohim\\", \\"in the midst of gods\\", and the word \\"qerev\\" if it were in the plural would mean \\"internal organs\\"HamMilon Hechadash, Avraham Even-Shoshan, copyright 1988.). Later in this Psalm, the word \\"gods\\" is used (in the KJV): Psalm 82:6 - \\"I have said, Ye [are] gods; and all of you [are] children of the most High.\\" Instead of \\"gods\\", another version has \\"godlike beings\\", but here again, the word is elohim/elohiym (Strong's H430). This passage is quoted in the New Testament in John 10:34. In the Books of Kings (), the prophet Micaiah has a vision of Yahweh seated among \\"the whole host of heaven\\" standing on his right and on his left. He asks who will go entice Ahab and a spirit volunteers. This has been interpreted as an example of a divine council. The first two chapters of the Book of Job describe the \\"Sons of God\\" assembling in the presence of Yahweh. Like \\"multitudes of heaven\\", the term \\"Sons of God\\" defies certain interpretation. This assembly has been interpreted by some as another example of divine council. Others translate \\"Sons of God\\" as \\"angels\\", and thus argue this is not a divine council because angels are God's creation and not deities. \\"The role of the divine assembly as a conceptual part of the background of Hebrew prophecy is clearly displayed in two descriptions of prophetic involvement in the heavenly council. In 1 Kings 22:19-23... Micaiah is allowed to see God (elohim) in action in the heavenly decision regarding the fate of Ahab. Isaiah 6 depicts a situation in which the prophet himself takes on the role of the messenger of the assembly and the message of the prophet is thus commissioned by Yahweh. The depiction here illustrates this important aspect of the conceptual background of prophetic authority.\\"Freedman, David N. ed., \\"The Anchor Bible Dictionary\\" Volume 2 pg 123, Doubleday, New York =Chinese= In Chinese theology, the deities under the Jade Emperor were sometimes referred to as the celestial bureaucracy because they were portrayed as organized like an earthly government. =Celtic= In Celtic mythology, most of the deities are considered to be members of the same family - the Tuatha D√© Danann. Family members include the Goddesses Danu, Brigid, Airmid, The Morr√≠gan, and others. Gods in the family include Ogma, the Dagda, Lugh and Goibniu, again, among many others. The Celts honoured many tribal and tutelary deities, along with spirits of nature and ancestral spirits. Sometimes a deity was seen as the ancestor of a clan and family line. Leadership of the family changed over time and depending on the situation. The Celtic deities do not fit most Classical ideas of a \\"Divine Council\\" or pantheon. =Ancient Greek= Zeus and Hera preside over the divine council in Greek mythology. The council assists Odysseus in Homer's Odyssey. =Ancient Roman= Jupiter presides over the Roman pantheon who prescribe punishment on Lycaon in Ovid's Metamorphoses, as well as punishing Argos and Thebes in Thebaid by Statius. =Norse= There are mentions in Gautreks saga and in the euhemerized work of Saxo Grammaticus of the Norse gods meeting in council. The gods sitting in council in their judgment seats or \\"thrones of fate\\" is one of the refrains in the Eddic poem \\"V√∂lusp√°\\"; a \\"thing\\" of the gods is also mentioned in \\"Baldrs draumar\\", \\"√ûrymskvi√∞a\\" and the skaldic \\"Haustl√∂ng\\", in those poems always in the context of some calamity. Snorri Sturluson, in his Prose Edda, referred to a daily council of the gods at Ur√∞'s well, citing a verse from \\"Gr√≠mnism√°l\\" about Thor being forced through rivers to reach it.Lindow, p. 290. However, although the word regin usually refers to the gods, in some occurrences of regin√æing it may be simply an intensifier meaning \\"great\\", as it is in modern Icelandic, rather than indicating a meeting of the divine council.Lindow, p. 148.

Background Traditional HVAC systems, such as variable air volume (VAV) systems serving multiple zones, have potential problems in terms of poor thermal comfort and possible microbial contamination. Depending on the environment and the parallel system involved, in a DOAS setup the outdoor air system will handle some of the sensible load in addition to the latent load, and the parallel system will handle the remaining sensible load. The main point of a DOAS system is to provide dedicated ventilation rather than ventilation as an incidental part of the process of conditioning interior air. DOAS is a term given to a system that has been used extensively in Europe and in various forms in the US.  System overview  William Coad proposed in 1999 to handle the OA (outdoor air) and return air separately in building HVAC systems. Gatley also describes the application of DOAS for delivering dehumidified air to buildings to improve the indoor air quality and thermal comfort. More recent research efforts have been conducted to study the basics of DOAS with emphasis on the potential advantages compared to the conventional HVAC systems. S.A. Mumma suggests that there are four main problems with conventional all air overhead mixing VAV HVAC systems.http://doas.psu.edu/doas.html Accessed 11/15/2010 These issues of VAV systems highlight the corresponding advantages of DOAS systems. However, some disadvantages of DOAS include: potentially higher first costs, lack of use in the United States, and potentially higher complexity. * Ventilation air in all air VAV HVAC systems: Designers and building engineers are unable to know exactly how the ventilation air that is mixed with the return air in a typical VAV system is distributed throughout the building. Issues such as air leakage, control setpoints, minimum air volume settings, and short-circuiting (e.g. exhaust air mixing with intake fresh air) can all affect the amount of ventilation air that reaches a space. A DOAS system solves this problem by providing a dedicated supply of 100% outdoor air. * Need for excess outdoor air flow and conditioning in VAV systems: When the multiple spaces equation of ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2004 is used, generally from 20-70% more outdoor air is required in an effort to assure proper room air distribution in all air systems than is required with a dedicated outdoor air systems. Cooling and dehumidifying the high outdoor air quantities in the summer and humidifying and heating the air in the winter is an energy intensive proposition. The DOAS system is sized to meet the requirements, and does not require oversizing. * VAV box minimums have to be set high to account for ventilation requirements: perhaps contrary to current practice, VAV box minimums must reflect both the ventilation requirements of the space and the fraction of ventilation air in the supply air. For example, a space requiring 5663 standard litre per minute (SLPM) (200 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM)) of ventilation air and served with supply air that is 40% ventilation air, will require a box minimum setting of 14158 SLPM (500 SCFM) (i.e. 200/0.4) rather than the conventional practice of 5663 SLPM (200 SCFM). When the box minimums are properly set to satisfy the ventilation requirements, the potential for considerable terminal reheat becomes an issue. Therefore, properly operating all air VAV systems will always use more terminal reheat than dedicated outdoor air systems supplying air at the same temperature. * No decoupling of latent and sensible space loads: The inability to decouple the space sensible and latent loads leads to high space relative humidity at low sensible loads in the occupied spaces. Properly designed dedicated outdoor air systems can accommodate 100% of the space latent loads and a portion of the space sensible loads, thus decoupling the space sensible and latent loads. A parallel sensible-only cooling system is then used to accommodate the sensible loads not met by the dedicated outdoor air systems. There is therefore a strong incentive to control the space latent loads independently of the space sensible loads to avoid moisture related Indoor air quality problems.  Parallel terminal systems  For a typical DOAS ventilation system, the outside air system can accommodate around 0-30% of the space sensible load. In order to create a comfortable indoor environment, the balance of the space sensible loads must be accommodated by many other optional equipment choices as follows: *Radiant ceiling panels *A parallel all air variable-air-volume (VAV) systems *Packaged unitary water source heat pumps *Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) systems *Fan coil units = Radiant system = Compared to other sensible cooling systems, radiant ceiling cooling panels are the best parallel system choice for use with the DOAS. Because the DOAS only accommodates the space ventilation and latent loads, it provides an opportunity to reduce the required floor-to-floor height by reducing the size of the duct system and the required fan power. There are numerous advantages of a radiant ceiling cooling system coupled with a DOAS.

The main advantages are: *Because radiant loads are treated directly and air motion in the space is at normal ventilation levels, comfort levels can be better than those of other air- conditioning systems *Meet the requirement of supply quantities for ventilation and dehumidification *Due to the reduced outdoor air quantities, the DOAS system can be installed with smaller duct system *Radiant ceiling cooling panels can eliminate wet surface cooling coils and reduce the potential for septic contamination *The automatic sprinkler system piping can be applied into radiant ceiling cooling panel systems The main disadvantage is related to higher initial costs. Besides the advantages presented above, parallel radiant cooling panels offer other advantages as well, such as compact design, vertical shaft space area savings, and quick accommodation of dynamic controls. Energy savings in DOAS/radiant ceiling cooling panel system can by linked to: cooling coil load reduction, chiller energy reduction, pumping energy consumption and fan energy consumption reduction. In general, due to the total energy recovery and small supply air quantity of DOAS, the chiller energy consumption can be reduced significantly compared to the conventional VAV system. In a study of a pilot DOAS/radiant ceiling cooling panel system, hourly energy simulation predicts that the annual electrical energy consumption of the pilot DOAS/radiant panel cooling system is 42% less than that of the conventional VAV system with economizer control. Beside solving problems with conventional VAV systems that listed above, DOAS offers more benefits as follows: *Reducing more than 50% of mechanical system operating cost compared to conventional VAV systems *Equal or lower first cost with simple controls *Offering up to 80% of points needed for the basic Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification = Air- based system = There are two main ways to design a DOAS when using an air- based system as the parallel system: Separate systems with different ductwork In this setup, there is an outdoor air system that dumps preconditioned air (accounting for latent load and partial sensible load) directly into the space in its own duct/diffuser. There is a separate system (e.g. fan coil unit) that takes air from the space and conditions it to meet the remaining space sensible load. Advantages: *Easier to measure the outdoor air flow rate into the space *Easier to measure airflows and balance system *Avoids imposing ventilation loads on space HVAC equipment (Fan coil unit) Disadvantages: *Separate ductwork for parallel paths can increase first costs *Separate diffusers for outdoor air and recirculated air may not provide adequate mixing *Separate parallel paths for airflow increases overall airflow to the space which can increase overall fan energy consumption Combined system Conditioned outdoor air is ducted to the terminal unit in the space. In this setup, the preconditioned outdoor air is ducted into the fan coil units directly, mixing with the return air from the space. This system is similar to a chilled beam setup. Advantages: *Combined ductwork leads to lower initial costs *Combined airflow reduces air volume and consequently fan energy use *Thorough mixing of outdoor air and return air from space Disadvantages: *Local terminal unit must operate whenever ventilation is required, regardless whether or not the sensible load has been met *Balancing airflow may be more difficult  Equipment  With the increasing application of DOAS in many countries, there is also increasing demand for DOAS equipment, such as a total energy wheel that uses total energy recovery, a passive dehumidifier wheel, and other relevant equipment. The effectiveness of the total energy wheel is an important factor for improving the efficiency of DOAS.  Design  The requirements in the design of a DOAS include: *Separating the OA system from the thermal control system to ensure proper ventilation in all occupied spaces *Conditioning the OA to handle all the space latent load and as much of the space sensible load as possible *Maximizing the cost-effective use of energy recovery equipment *Integrating fire suppression and energy transport systems *Using ceiling radiant sensible cooling panels for occupant thermal control Mumma proposed the following steps for designing the DOAS: *Calculating the space sensible and latent cooling loads on the summer design day based on the design conditions for the space *Determining the minimum air flow rate that each space requires based on the ASHRAE Standard 62.1 ventilation guidelinesAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (2007). ASHRAE standard 62.1. Atlanta, GA *Determining the supply air humidity ratio for each space *Typically, the design supply air dry bulb temperature will equal the required supply air dew point temperature) *Using energy recovery to move exhaust air heat back to the DOAS unit (during heating seasons) For DOAS with air-based system as parallel cooling system, the following steps were proposed: 1) calculating the sensible cooling load met by the DOAS supply air for each space; 2) calculating the sensible cooling load remaining on the parallel system for each space; 3) determining the supply air dry bulb temperature for parallel systems (above the space dew point temperature to avoid condensation); 4) determining the supply air flow rate for each parallel sensible cooling device.  Energy and cost  Many studies have been conducted to demonstrate the energy and cost performance of DOAS in terms of simulations. Khattar and Brandemuehl simulated the parallel system and a conventional single system for a large retail store in Dallas, St. Louis, Washington DC, and New Orleans. The study demonstrated annual energy savings of 14% to 27% and 15% to 23% smaller equipment capacity for the parallel cooling system. Jeong et al. compared the energy and cost performance of a DOAS with parallel ceiling radiant panels to a conventional VAV system with air-side economizer for a nearly office space in an educational building in Pennsylvania. A 42% reduction of the annual energy usage for the DOAS system with substantial savings in both fan and chiller energy use was reported in this study. Emmerich and McDowell evaluated the potential energy savings of DOAS in U.S. commercial buildings. The building model was developed to be consistent with typical new construction and meet the ASHRAE Standard 90.1 (ASHRAE 90.1) requirements.American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (2007). Ashrae standard 90.1. Atlanta, GA The simulation results indicated that the full DOAS resulted in the annual HVAC energy cost savings ranging from 21% to 38%.

While serving as a missionary, he also contributed to Canada's natural history, writing on insects he discovered; he had a species of mouse and bat named after him. Early years and ordination John Henry Keen was born in England in 1851; he graduated from a Bible college in Islington in 1873. In 1874 he was sent by the Bishop of London as a missionary at Moose Fort in Ontario. He was ordained by John Horden, Bishop of Moosonee in 1877. 1880s and 1890s From 1882 to 1889, he was in London, where he was first a curate at Spitalfields and later in Islington. In 1890, he left again for Canada where he was based at the northern end of Graham Island in British Columbia. He lived at a village called Massett where several families would share a longhouse which typically had totem poles outside. A totem pole, sold to the British Museum by Charles F. Newcombe, which Keen helped to interpret. The village of Masset (in 1878) Whilst in Canada Keen translated the Book of Common Prayer into Haida; he later translated the gospels of Luke and John and the Acts of the Apostles. In Masset, Keen took an interest in natural history. In 1891, he published his first paper on local beetles (Some British Columbian Coleoptera) and sent off 46 samples for identification to the British Museum. In 1894 he first described the Northwestern deer mouse, which was named Keen's mouse, or Peromyscus keeni, in his honour. He was also the first to scientifically described a type of brown mouse eared bat. This animal is now called Keen's myotis (Myotis keenii Trouessart). In 1896 he also found the first type specimen of what is now known to be a sub-species of northern saw-whet owl. Keen returned on leave in 1898 and his translated prayer book was published in 1899 in London by the Missionary Society. The book went out of print as a result of its intended audience dying out. It is estimated that before the Europeans arrived, there were 10,000 people who spoke Haida. By 1900, there were about 700.The Book of Common Prayer in Haida, Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, London, 1899, accessed 16 November 2010, There were thought to be only about 30 people in 1999 who spoke the Haida language, Artifacts In the 1890s there were visits from the English Charles F. Newcombe, George Amos Dorsey from Chicago and a Scottish guide named James Deans. These people were travelling to gather artefacts that might be of ethnographic interest. Their methods varied, but they frequently held little regard for the native Canadians. Keen had to angrily take them to task after he travelled to confirm for himself that visitors had not only raided graves but also not restored them to there former state. Keen found hair and coffins strewn about from where they had dug to steal skulls and bones. Keen wrote to complain about the desecration and challenged Dean to name his accomplices although he was clear that the benefactor of their work was the Field Columbian Museum and that the perpetrators were Americans. George Dorsey was known for his haste in finding artefacts was told of Keen's letter to the \\"Daily Colonist and he argued that Keen's anger should be ignored. The British Museum bought a number of artefacts from Keen, including a model of a house and an attached totem pole which had been carved by John Gwaytihl. The museum also bought another 44 objects and received a description of the story that the totem pole was intended to tell. By coincidence the museum acquired a complete 39-foot-high totem pole that differed only slightly from the model in 1903. The museum now not only has the pole but it has a description of its significance and symbols. The museum bought the pole from Charles Frederick Newcombe. 20th century activities Keen returned to Canada again in 1899, but this time he was based at Metlakatla, where he stayed until 1913.

A political geographer, most of Prescott's work focused on international boundary issues, particularly maritime boundaries. Education Prescott earned his BSc (1952). Dip. Ed. and MA degrees at the University of Durham in the United Kingdom. After Prescott was awarded the Marshall Scholarship, University of London awarded his doctorate degree. Career Prescott started his career as a schoolteacher in Durham after undergraduate study, and was then appointed lecturer in the Department of Geography, University of Ibadan, Nigeria in 1956. He gained a Masters and his PhD (on Nigerian border issues) while in post. He was appointed lecturer in geography at the University of Melbourne in 1961. He was made Professor in 1986 at the age of 55, and retired in 1996.Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia (ASSA), Profile of ASSA Fellow He was a commentator on political matters and geography for Australian ABC radio, also commenting on and predicting Australian election outcomes, until 1987.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-12-23/the-national-tally-room- in-1983/9389626https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/resources/Prescottbiography.pdf Scholarly contributions Prescott's interests remained in political geography, always with a focus on borders and frontiers, and their material and political characteristics. Studies included Australian Aboriginal conceptions of territory and frontiers, border disputes in South East Asia and the South China Sea, and the effects of the colonial period on African borders. van Houtum summarized Prescott and Julian Minghi's two major contributions to border geography as showing \\"Where is the border located, how did it came about, evolve, change over time, become the topic of (military) disputes and what are the political consequences of its (changes in) location.\\"Henk van Houtum. 2005. Geopolitics The Geopolitics of Borders and Boundaries. Geopolitics, 10(4):672‚Äì679. Prescott's last book explored the legal and geographical problems of borders, and was coauthored with the renowned human rights lawyer and academic Gillian Triggs. Prescott was particularly active in examining the problems generated by maritime boundaries and borders, and resolution of disputes through negotiation and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. He said in his 1985 book with Schofield that \\"The marked increase in maritime space coming under the jurisdiction of coastal states in the post-war period, coupled with similarly significant changes in the diversity and intensity of offshore activities, radically transformed the nature of maritime boundary negotiations, enhancing both their complexity and importance. Clearly, the extension of coastal states' sovereignty seawards has generated the potential for many new maritime boundaries and a host of overlapping jurisdictional claims and offshore boundary disputes.\\" Selected works Prescott published widely on boundary issues and political geography. A full list of his works was compiled by his wife Dorothy, available here. Much of it is in/with conventional academic journals and publishers, and is therefore inaccessible online. In addition, his early work incorporated quotes in French and German, inaccessible to many. These books have, however, been re-released in the mid 2010s. Major works were: * Prescott, J.R.V. 1965.

He was born at Hardington Mandeville, Somerset and died at Oxford. Vassall was the son of the rector of Hardington Mandeville. He was educated at Charterhouse School and at Oriel College, Oxford and he played cricket for his college but not for the university side. His fame at Oxford was as a long jumper, and he was the champion for three consecutive years from 1897 to 1899 in the Varsity athletic match against Cambridge University, his jump of 23 feet and three inches in 1899 being only two inches short of the then record, held by C. B. Fry. On leaving the university, Vassall became a schoolmaster at the Dragon School in Oxford, remaining there until his death, by which time he was joint headmaster. In the school holidays in 1902, 1903 and 1905, he played a few cricket matches for Somerset as a lower-order batsman and right-arm fast bowler. In his first game, against Surrey, he joined Peter Randall Johnson with Somerset needing 65 for victory with three wickets to fall and hit an unbeaten 27 to take his side to success. But in his five other matches for Somerset over the next three years he only made 19 other runs and his only wicket came in 1905 when, as the seventh bowler used, he finally broke a stand of 261 by the Kent second wicket pair Ted Dillon and James Seymour.

At a height of 1,958 feet and an elevation of , Mount Sentinel also features the hillside letter \\"M\\", a large concrete structure up its western face. History The University of Montana first received land on Mount Sentinel in 1902 when the Northern Pacific Railroad Company donated 40 acres at the foot and up the slope of the mountain. The U.S. Congress later turned over many acres of Mount Sentinel so that campus extended up the slope to the crest of the mountain, making the University of Montana the only university in the nation to own a mountain. In 2000, the city of Missoula also purchased 475 acres along the face of Mount Sentinel. Glacial Lake Missoula ;Glacial Lake Missoula Between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago, a Pleistocene Ice Age glacier moved through the Purcell Trench in northern Idaho, damming the Clark Fork River. This glacial dam created Glacial Lake Missoula, a lake larger than Lake Erie and Lake Ontario combined. As the lake continued to grow, pressure increased on the glacial dam, ultimately causing the dam to fail. Water from the lake rushed westward at speeds between 30 and 50 miles per hour across Montana, Idaho, and Washington. The violent flow created by the draining of Glacial Lake Missoula left shoreline marks that are still visible on the face of Mount Sentinel and Mount Jumbo, a neighboring mountain to the north. The \\"M\\" ;History The first trail up Mount Sentinel to the area that the \\"M\\" would later occupy was cut by forestry students in 1908. In 1909, the junior class constructed the first \\"M\\" at the top of that trail with whitewashed rocks. In 1912, the freshman class constructed a small white \\"M\\" of wood. This \\"M\\" stood upright on the face of the mountain and cost $18 to build. The wooden \\"M\\" was destroyed by wind in 1914, replaced, and then wrecked by wind again. In 1915, a new \\"M\\" made of whitewashed rocks was constructed 200 feet above the original \\"M\\" site. A concrete \\"M\\" measuring 125-by-100-feet was built in 1968 at a cost of $4,328. The concrete structure was built because it was no longer feasible to maintain the old, rock \\"M\\". This concrete \\"M\\" is still located on Mt. Sentinel today. ;Tradition Between 1915 and 1968, while the \\"M\\" was composed of whitewashed rocks, freshman boys hiked the trail to the \\"M\\" each year to apply a fresh coat of white-wash. The tradition ended with the construction of the cement \\"M\\". Starting in 1919, freshman boys hiked the trail to the \\"M\\" during homecoming and lit the outline with railroad lanterns. This tradition continues today, with UM Advocates making the hike each year at homecoming to light the \\"M\\". Each year, during Native American Awareness Week, a sunrise ceremony is held at the base of the \\"M\\" where traditional Salish Morning and Honor Songs are sung. Preservation The University of Montana natural areas weed manager organizes an annual herbicide application on Mount Sentinel. There is also an annual community weed pull on the mountain. The Forest Service handles weed control for the 441 acres of Mount Sentinel that it owns. In 2006, outdoor retail co-op REI, which gave away $1 million in grants to nonprofit groups dedicated to preservation of community parks, awarded a $10,000 grant to Friends of Missoula Parks for use on improvements to Mount Sentinel. After a fire in 2008, the conservation lands manager for the city of Missoula and a University of Montana natural areas specialist teamed up to spread native grass and flower seeds over the area of Mount Sentinel that was burned. In the fall of 2010, the University of Montana Student Guild of the Society for Ecological Restoration teamed up with Run Wild Missoula and other volunteers to help restore the \\"M\\" trail. The group added gravel to the path, reseeded barren areas, blocked unwanted side trails, and added more steps to the eighth switchback. Activism In 2005, students of Missoula's Hellgate High School staked a 50-by-20-foot red ribbon next to the \\"M\\". The ribbon was installed as part of an annual Hellgate event called Red Ribbon Week that focuses on staying drug-free. In 2010, local environmental activists added a white \\"350\\" made of tarps next to the \\"M\\" on Mount Sentinel. The display was organized as a part of the 350.orghttp://350.org organization's 10-10-10 Global Work Parties effort. Over 7,000 work parties worldwide did projects to decrease carbon and heighten the awareness within political circles in order to slow climate change. Fires Mount Sentinel has a long history of fires, dating back to at least 1930 when the Montana Kaimin reported a grass blaze. More recently, over 300 acres on Mount Sentinel's west slope, directly above the University of Montana campus, burned in July 2008. At least 20 acres also burned in July 2006.

First founded by Emperor Wu of Han in the wake of the successful reconquest of the area from Xiongnu tribes, it was dissolved during the late Eastern Han Dynasty and then reconstituted centuries later during the Northern Wei and Sui periods, before finally being dissolved during the Tang Dynasty. Name The term Shuofang, in ancient usage, simply referred to the north; this definition was recorded in dictionaries such as the Erya. History The northward bend of the Yellow River is an area of considerable strategic importance that had been part of the State of Zhao during the early Warring States period. During this period it was called Jiuyuan, and was a commandery. As Zhao gradually weakened, the area fell under Xiongnu control, only to be reconquered during the Qin Dynasty by a large expedition led by the general Meng Tian. In the chaos of the rebellions that took place during the end of the Qin Dynasty, the Xiongnu once again moved into the area and took control, and retained this area even after the foundation of the Han Dynasty, using it as an important staging post for raiding into northern and northeastern China. It was only during the Han‚ÄìXiongnu War launched by Emperor Wu that the Han Dynasty proactively sought to take over the former borderlands of the Qin Dynasty. In 127 BC, an expedition led by Wei Qing defeated the Xiongnu, leading to the foundation of Shuofang Commandery; by 8 BC the commandery had ten constituent counties. In the spring of 617, Liang Shidu, a former regimental commander from a prominent family of Shuofang commandery on the southern edge of ethe Ordos, seized power from the commandery officials and declared the establishment of the \\"Liang\\" state with himself as emperor.

Photo taken on Sept. 1, 2010. Eric Hays is a former University of Montana basketball player who served as head basketball coach of at Hellgate High School in Missoula, Mont., for 25 years. He was a mathematics teacher there until his retirement in 2009. Hays is best remembered for his outstanding performance at the 1975 NCAA tournament against the powerhouse UCLA Bruins in the Sweet 16. He scored a game-high 32 points on 13-of-16 shooting, grabbed seven rebounds and dished out six assists in the Grizzlies' 67-64 lossMontana vs. UCLA 1975 NCAA Tournament Box Score to the eventual national champions, who had six players that went on to play in the NBA. Early life Eric Hays was born July 4, 1952, in Junction City, Ore., a farming community roughly 15 miles from Eugene and 25 miles from Corvallis. Hays lived there for the first 18 years of his life and attended Junction City High School where he was a two-year starter on the basketball team as well as the football team's quarterback for one season before injuring the growth plate in his shoulder during his sophomore year. His high school consisted of 450 students throughout three grades. Hays believed he would eventually raise a family in a similar community-oriented environment with a small school.File:EricHaysInterview.OGG Interview with Eric Hays on Nov. 28, 2010 College career Hays attended Washington State University in Pullman, Wash. Originally, he planned on being an accountant, but changed his aspirations toward coaching after observing one of his brother's high school games, in which he thought the coaching was \\"unfair\\" to the players. Hays then declared his major as math education and pursued his goals of becoming a high school teacher and basketball coach. Hays also pursued basketball at WSU because the Cougars allowed players to \\"walk-on,\\" meaning non-recruited students could try out for the team. Hays defied the odds and made the freshman team of 20. Before the season began, he rose to the position of \\"sixth man,\\" the first player off the bench during games. By the fourth game that season, Hays was one of the starting five and never relinquished the role. The Junction City native ended the season second in both scoring and rebounding on a team that finished with an outstanding record of 20-2. Midway through his freshman year, Hays was awarded a full-ride scholarship by the university due to his excellence on the court. To his surprise, he was cut by the new head coach after only two days of tryouts his sophomore year of 1971. Head coach Marv Harshman had abruptly left to coach the University of Washington in July of that year. Hays then followed Washington State's former assistant coach, the legendary Jud Heathcote, and transferred to the University of Montana in January 1972. He again made the team as a walk-on the following year.Hays' tournament heroics part of Grizzlies' lore Hays' high school dream was realized in his final year as a collegiate basketball player. He had always wanted to play at the Memorial Coliseum in Portland, Ore. At the twilight of his senior year, he was given the opportunity, and he didn't put it to waste. Entering the 1975 season, the Montana Grizzlies had never won an NCAA tournament game. This year would prove to be different as Hays and company posted a record of 21-8, including a 13-1 conference record en route to winning the Big Sky Conference championship, which earned them a bid to the tournament. The Grizzlies defeated Utah State 69-63 in the first round, sending them to Portland and the Memorial Coliseum to face off against the mighty UCLA Bruins. The Bruins were led by coaching legend John Wooden and eventual NBA star Marques Johnson. Hays had the game of his life against a team that went on to win its 10th national championship in 12 years.UCLA History In the final game of his college career, the 6-foot-3 Hays racked up a game- and career-high 32 points, almost singlehandedly willing his team to stay right with UCLA. Despite his efforts, Montana fell short 67-64, but the game continues to be talked about and Hays still is asked if he's \\"Eric Hays, the basketball player.\\" In college, Hays married his high school sweetheart, Deb, in 1973. He graduated from UM with a degree in math education in the spring of 1975.

Eric and Deb Hays moved to Sheridan, Ore., 75 miles north of Junction City, after his brief stint in Milwaukee. Hays took a job as the lone faculty member that made up the entire mathematics department at Sheridan High School, which consisted of 200 students in four grades. In addition to his teaching duties, he accepted positions as the assistant football coach, the junior varsity basketball coach and the head baseball coach at the high school. Hays heard from a student that Heathcote was awarded the head basketball coaching job at Michigan State University. Again, he followed his former coach and helped out as a graduate assistant. He coached the JV team, went to the varsity practices, and helped recruit high school talent. Among those recruited were eventual NBA players Jay Vincent and Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson, a superstar member of the Basketball Hall of Fame. The Montana Grizzly standout obtained his master's degree in mathematics in one year at MSU and was drawn back to Missoula by job openings in the math department as well as the head boys basketball coaching position at Hellgate High School. Along with newly-born twin daughters, Kelly and Kristy, the Hayses moved back to Missoula in 1977. Their son, Jeff, was born in 1983, and another set of twin girls, Molly and Mandy, was born in 1985. =Coaching career= Hays went on to coach the Missoula Hellgate Knights for 25 years, racking up more than 350 wins, the most in school history, and three state championships in 1985, 1990 and 1993. According to Hays, the 1993 team stood out as the most talented team he had coached. The team went undefeated at 23-0 in a season that featured a regular season-ending game against then undefeated Billings West. Hellgate prevailed and went on to close out the season without a loss, defeating Billings West again in the championship, this time 71-68 in double overtime. It was the first time in 20 years that a team had gone undefeated. Hays' 1993 team was led by eventual Montana Grizzly starter J.R. Camel. In 1985, Hays' boys took down crosstown rival Big Sky 52-47 for the first of Hays' three championships. The team finished 18-6. The 1990 Knights again finished 18-6 en route to Hays' second championship as Hellgate downed the Butte Bulldogs 57-51. Hays came close an undefeated season in 1988 as his team had a spotless record until it lost to Bozeman 50-42 in the championship game. =Teaching career= Hays returned to his home-state of Oregon for a brief stint at Sheridan High School as the only mathematics teacher at the school stretching from 1975-1976. Upon finishing graduate school, he fulfilled two dreams at once, by becoming a mathematics teacher as well as the head boys' basketball coach at Hellgate High School in Missoula. He continued teaching math for 32 years from 1977-2009. =Current life= Along with the rest of the 1975 Sweet 16 team under coach Heathcote, Hays was inducted into the Montana Sports Hall of Fame on Nov. 12, 2010. He teamed with eventual 1978 NBA fourth overall pick Michael Ray Richardson (New York Knicks) to lead the 1975 Grizzlies on their historic journey to the NCAA tournament.Michael Ray Richardson Hays is currently working as a volunteer assistant coach alongside his son, Jeff, who is following in his father's footsteps and has recently accepted the head coaching position at Hellgate. In addition to his volunteer coaching role, Hays is also working as a financial investor and retirement planner. He is currently working with SII (Service, Innovation, IntegritySII Investments) investments in Missoula.

The program is in line with Africa‚Äôs Science and Technology Consolidated Plan of Action (CPA). The specific goals for water sciences (p. 28 of the CPA) are: *to improve conservation and utilization of the continent's water resources; *to improve the quality and the quantity of water available to rural and urban households; *to strengthen national and regional capacities for water resources management and reduce impacts of water related disasters; and *to enlarge the range of technologies for water supply and improve access to affordable quality water. Calls of interest were launched and proposals evaluated in both the Southern African and Western African regions to identify and appoint Centres of Excellences in water sciences.

F.155 specified exacting demands: *The capability of making an intercept within 20 minutes of target contact (250 miles from the UK) with a target speed of Mach 1+ *Ceiling: 60,000 ft (18,000 m) *Armament: a mixture of infra-red guided missiles and radar guided missiles *Crew: A crew of two was specified because of the anticipated workload: pilot plus weapon systems operator (WSO)/navigator The Ministry of Supply made clear in the requirement that the plane and missiles should be treated as a \\"weapon system\\" i.e., a cohesive whole.

The paper was a major review of military spending and one of its elements was the cancellation of nearly all manned fighter projects as a radical change had occurred in strategic threats with the expectation that intercontinental ballistic missiles and low-level strike would replace high flying bombers.

He was arrested, accused of several crimes, including having taken part in the attempted murder of bank manager Moses Garu; charges on that count were dropped when \\"witnesses failed to testify\\". He was convicted for a robbery committed in 2000, and given a five-year sentence.\\"CONVICTED SOLOMONS MP WARNS AGAINST ILLEGAL FISHING\\", Pacific Islands Report, 20 September 2010 In 2006, he was \\"acquitted of the death of two special constables allegedly killed in his yard\\" in 2002.\\"MALAITA REBEL LEADER ACQUITTED OF 2002 -MURDER\\" , Pacific Islands Report, 3 September 2006 Sent to prison after RAMSI's arrival, he \\"found religion on the inside and, on his release, set up a successful business\\". Having studied heavy plant mechanics at the Afutara Vocational School, he eventually became Managing Director of the Lion Heart Company, before going into politics in 2010. He began his political career by standing in the North Malaita constituency in the August 2010 general election. He was elected, and appointed Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources in Prime Minister Danny Philip's government. In September, as Fisheries Minister, he warned that the government would crack down on foreign vessels illegally fishing in Solomon Islands waters. In September 2010, he was charged with \\"attempted murder with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, assault on a police officer and discharging a firearm in a public place\\", for crimes allegedly committed in 2001.\\"SOLOMONS MP FACES ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGE\\", Pacific Islands Report, 14 September 2010 Specifically, he was accused of inflicting head injuries on police officer Sam Manekeha, and of shooting civilian Robert Solo in both knees, while a commander in the Malaita Eagle Force.\\"Lusibaea Released, Opposition Uproar\\", Solomon Times, 17 January 2011 In November, he pleaded guilty in court to the charges of assault causing grievous bodily harm and assaulting a police officer, and was remanded in custody to await his sentence. While Lusibaea was awaiting his sentence, he received unexpected praise from the Leader of the Opposition, Steve Abana. Abana declared himself impressed with Lusibaea's work as Fisheries Minister, noting his achievement in negotiating with Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, earlier in November, to successfully double the access fee for foreign vessels wishing to fish in Solomon Islands waters. Abana stated: > \\"Mr Lusibaea's outstanding performance and his continued assistance to > community groups touched many hearts and this speaks loud and clear of the > totally changed person he is now to what he was during the ethnic tension. > Solomon Islands needs enthusiastic leaders like Mr Lusibaea who are keen to > learn and to carry out their official obligations to the best of their > ability.\\"\\"Gov‚Äôt uses fisheries as bait: Opposition\\", Solomon Star, 22 > November 2010 On 30 November, he was sentenced to two years and nine months in gaol for assault and grievous bodily harm. As his sentence exceeded six months in gaol, he lost his seat in Parliament, and thus his position in government.\\"Solomon Islands faces crisis as minister jailed\\", The Australian, 1 December 2010 He was released from gaol on parole on 14 January, reportedly for good behaviour and for having undergone rehabilitation. His early release caused an \\"uproar\\" among the Opposition, with acting Leader of the Opposition Matthew Wale requesting further explanation, and suggesting that the government might have pressured the parole board into granting Lusibaea's release. On 20 January, the Minister for Police, James Tora, reduced Lusibaea's sentence to one month, using his discretion as Minister under section 38 of the Correctional Service Act. Consequently, as it appeared Lusibaea was no longer barred from occupying his seat, he resumed his functions in Parliament.\\"Can Lusibaea perform his functions as a member of parliament?\\" , Solomon Star, 26 January 2011 The Opposition announced it would \\"challenge the matter in court\\".\\"Opposition plans to challenge Lusibaea‚Äôs remission\\", Solomon Star, 27 January 2011 Rodney Kingmele, President of the Solomon Islands Bar Association, also criticised the decision.\\"An attack on independence of judiciary\\", Solomon Star, 1 February 2011 Lusibaea's ability to sit in Parliament as a member of the government majority was viewed as crucial at a time when the government was struggling to maintain a viable majority, in the face of defections.\\"Government numbers decreasing\\", Solomon Star, 25 January 2011 It was initially unclear whether Lusibaea was set to resume his post in Cabinet, but a listing of ministers in April 2011 still had the position of Fisheries Minister \\"vacant\\".Cabinet of Solomon Islands , CIA, 19 April 2011 On 17 October, the High Court ruled, in the case brought by the Opposition, that the Minister for Police and the Parole Board had lacked the authority to reduce the sentence, although they did have the authority to remit it. They could reduce the execution of the sentence, but that did not alter the fact that the sentence had indeed been passed. A sentence could only be overturned by a court of appeal, or by the monarch's use of her prerogative of mercy. Thus it remained the case that, having been sentenced to two years and nine months in gaol, Lusibaea was barred from sitting in Parliament. The ruling came just as the Prime Minister had announced he intended for Lusibaea to resume his functions as Fisheries Minister - a decision rendered impossible by his renewed exclusion from Parliament.\\"High Court Rules against Lusibaea\\", Solomon Times, 18 October 2011\\"Solomon Islands Governor General accepts ruling on Lusibaea\\", Radio New Zealand International, 18 October 2011 Days after being excluded from Parliament once more, Lusibaea donated SI$74,700 to meet the tuition fees of all twenty-six students from his erstwhile constituency who were currently studying at the Solomon Islands College of Higher Education.

It was discovered in 1961 at Vavnbed Mountain in the Lovozero Massif, in the Northern Region of Russia. The researchers who first identified it, R P Tikhonenkova and M E Kazakova, named it for Kuzma Aleksevich Vlasov (1905‚Äì1964), a Russian mineralogist and geochemist who studied the Lovozero massif, and who was the founder of the Institute of Mineralogy, Geochemistry, and Crystal Chemistry of Rare Elements, Moscow, Russia.  Structure  At temperatures below 29 ¬∞C the stable form of vlasovite is triclinic , space group P. Above 29 ¬∞C the stable form is monoclinic 2/m. Most sources simply give it as monoclinic 2/m, space group C2/c. The silicate part of the structure is a chain composed of rings of four SiO4 tetrahedra linked by sharing a corner oxygen to form a chain of composition [Si4O11]6‚àí. These chains of tetrahedra link together with zirconium, Zr, octahedra to form a framework with channels extending along [001], parallel to the c crystal axis. The channels contain the sodium, Na, atoms.Canadian Mineralogist (2006) 44: 1349-1356  Unit cell  The unit cell parameters are a = 11 √Ö, b = 10 √Ö, c = 8.5 √Ö and Œ≤ = 100¬∞, with 4 formula units per unit cell (Z = 4). More accurate values are given by various sources as follows. For the monoclinic cell: *a = 10.98 √Ö, b = 10.00 √Ö, c = 8.52 √Ö, Œ≤ = 100.40¬∞ *a = 11.0390(5) √Ö, b = 10.0980(4) √Ö, c = 8.5677(4) √Ö, Œ≤ = 100.313(1)¬∞ *a = 11.063 √Ö, b = 10.15 √Ö, c = 8.60 √Ö, Œ≤ = 100.3¬∞Gobechiya, Pekov, Yu and Pushcharovski (2003) Crystallography Reports 48-5:750 For the triclinic cell: *a = 10.96 √Ö, b = 10.01 √Ö, c = 8.53 √Ö, alpha = 89.70¬∞, beta = 100.40¬∞, gamma = 90.48¬∞  Optical properties  Vlasovite is colorless, pink, pale brown or silvery in reflected light and colourless in transmitted light. The border zones of large grains are light brown due to dust-like inclusions. It is transparent to translucent, with a white streak and greasy luster, vitreous to pearly on cleavage surfaces. The refractive indices are Nx = 1.607, Ny = 1.623 and Nz = 1.628, similar to those of muscovite. Vlasovite is not fluorescent, but altered portions of the material fluoresce orange-yellow under both long-wave and short-wave ultra-violet illumination.  Physical properties  Crystals have been found up to 15 cm long, but vlasovite occurs more commonly as irregularly shaped grains and aggregates. It shows distinct cleavage parallel to the plane containing the a and c crystal axes, and this plane can also be a twin plane, although twinning is uncommon. Vlasovite is a brittle mineral, with an irregular to conchoidal fracture, hardness 6 and specific gravity 2.97. It is nearly insoluble in hydrochloric acid HCl and nitric acid HNO3, but it dissolves easily in a mixture of hydrofluoric acid, HF, and sulfuric acid H2SO4.  Environment  Vlasovite is a late phase in nepheline syenite and syenitic pegmatites. At Ascension Island it is found in miarolitic cavities in ejected blocks of peralkaline granite (Peralkaline rocks are deficient in aluminium but have sodium and potassium in excess of the amount needed to form feldspar). At the Lovozero Massif in Russia it is formed in areas of rock rich in microcline and albite in the contact zone between pegmatites and fenites (metasomatic rocks composed of alkaline feldspar, sodic pyroxene and alkaline amphibole), by the replacement of eudialyte. Associated minerals include arfvedsonite, aegirine, apatite and fluorite, in addition to microcline, albite and eudialyte.  Localities  The type locality is the Vavnbed Mountain, Lovozero Massif, Kola Peninsula, Murmanskaja Oblast', Northern Region, Russia, which is also a good locality for zircon crystals. Other localities for vlasovite include the volcanic Ascension Island, in the South Atlantic Ocean, the Kipawa Complex, Villedieu Township, Quebec and the Strange Lake Complex in Labrador. Type material is conserved for reference in two locations in Russia, the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute and the Fersman Mineralogical Museum in Moscow, and also in France, at the National School of Mines in Paris.

The word 'Jeseri' derives from Arabic word Jazari (ÿ¨ÿ≤ÿ±Ÿâ) which means 'Islander' or 'of island'. It is spoken on the islands of Chetlat, Bitra, Kiltan, Kadmat, Amini, Kavaratti, Androth, Agatti, and Kalpeni, in the archipelago of Lakshadweep. Each of these islands has its own dialect. Phonology The phonology is similar to the Mainland dialect of Malayalam, but with certain notable differences. The initial short vowels, especially 'u', may fall away. For example: rangi (Mal. urangi) - slept, lakka (Mal. ulakka) - pestle. As for the consonants, the following differences are notable: # Initial ch in Mainland Malayalam, becomes sh: sholli (Mal.(old) cholli) - said. # Initial p in Mainland Malayalam, becomes f: fenn (Mal. pennu) - girl. # Initial v in Mainland Malayalam, becomes b: bili (Mal. vili) - call. # The zh sound in Mainland Malayalam, becomes retroflex l (mostly), or y: mala (Mal. mazha) - rain, bayi (Mal. vazhi) - way. Grammar The grammar shows similarities to Mainland Malayalam. = Nouns = ;Case endings The case endings for nouns and pronouns are generally as follows: * Nominative: nil; * Accusative: a, na * Genitive: aa, naa, thaa; * Dative: kk, n, oon; * Communicative: oda, aa kooda, naa kooda; * Instrumental: aa kond, naa kond; * Locative: nd, naa ul, l(only in traces); * Ablative: nd; * Vocative: e, aa; ;Pronouns * naan: I; * nee: you (sing); * on: he (remote); * ben: he (proximate); * ol: she (remote); * bel: she (proximate); * adh: it/that (remote); * idh: it/this (proximate); * nom, namma, laaba: we (inclusive); * nanga: we (exclusive); * ninga: you (plural); * aba: they (remote); * iba: they (proximate); * thaan: self; = Verbs = The conjugations of verbs are similar to Mainland Malayalam. The verb 'kaanu' - meaning 'see', the same as in Mainland Malayalam, is illustrated here. There are three simple tenses. # Present: suffix added is nna (mostly nda); so kaanunna/kaanunda - sees, is seeing. # Past: the stem of the verb may change as in Mainland Malayalam. For 'kaanu', past is kanda - saw. # Future: the suffix added is 'um'. So, kaanum - will see. The negatives of these tenses show some differences: # For present tense, the negative is formed by adding vela (ppela for some verbs) to the stem. Not only that, a present negative may also function as a future negative. So, kaanuvela - is not seeing, does not see, will not see. # For past tense, the negative is formed by suffixing ela to the past stem. So, kandela - did not see, has not seen. # For the future tense, the old Malayalam poetic suffix 'aa' may be used (kaanaa). The interrogative forms are made by suffixing 'aa' with some changes effected. So, kaanundyaa (does/do ... see?) for kaanunda (sees), kandyaa (did ... see?) for kanda (saw), and kaanumaa/kaanunaa/kaanungaa (will ... see?) for kaanum (will see).

The first revelation about NRO came in 1973, but its very existence was not declassified until 1992. According to Jeffrey T. Richelson, \\"[m]ost often the Under Secretary of the Air Force served as a Director of the NRO\\".Jeffrey T. Richelson, The U.S. Intelligence Community (Cambridge Mass: Ballinger, 1989), pp. 26-29. NURO was initiated in 1969 and developed as a common office or liaison office for the United States Navy and the CIA to manage underwater reconnaissance. NURO used \\"special project submarines\\" like , , and deep inside the waters of the Soviet Union to put out listening devices, tap communication cables, monitor Soviet Navy bases and record sound signatures of Soviet submarines. NURO is a little-known agency; even its name has been secret and its very existence was first revealed in 1998.Sherry Sontag & Christopher Drew with Annette Lawrence Drew. Blind Man's Bluff ‚Äì The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage (New York: HarperCollins, 1998), pp. 83, 164 and 206; Jeffrey T. Richelson, The Wizards of Langley: Inside the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology (Boulder CO: Westview Press. 2001). Nigel West describe NURO as a joint \\"US Navy/CIA group\\" created \\"to coordinate and fund special projects conducted by submarines\\" in Nigel West, Historical Dictionary of International Intelligence ‚Äì Historical Dictionary of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, No. 4 (Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow, 2006). The United States Secretary of the Navy has served as its director.See below. Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew argue that the origin of NURO was the Soviet submarine K-129 that had sunk outside Hawaii in March 1968. When USS Halibut had returned half a year later with 22,000 photos of the Soviet submarine the CIA realized the significance of underwater reconnaissance.Sontag & Drew (1998), pp. 81-82 NURO was initially formed by CIA Director Richard Helms and dominated by the CIA: \\"from the day NURO was formed, the CIA [with its Deputy Director for Science and Technology Carl Duckett] took charge. [Captain James] Bradley [from U.S. Naval Intelligence] could spare only a few people for the new office. His entire staff in the undersea part of Office of Naval Intelligence numbered only about a few dozen. The CIA, however, had no such constraints. It moved in with eight permanent staffers and more consultants loyal to the agency\\".Sontag & Drew (1998), p. 83. The Navy prepared to go down with a midget submarine to K-129. However, the CIA wanted the whole submarine. They built the ship Glomar Explorer (now GSF Explorer) to raise K-129, which became very expensive (up to 500 million dollars).Sontag & Drew (1998), pp. 83-84, 184-208. From mid-1970s, the CIA lost its day-to-day control of NURO. Captain James Bradley was able to conduct his own special project operations. Through Bradley it was a direct link to General Alexander Haig and Henry Kissinger. 1972-74, the Secretary of Navy John Warner was the Director of NURO.Sontag & Drew (1998), pp. 83, 164-167. The Chief Scientist of the U.S. Navy, John Pi√±a Craven, argues that Bradley was a Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) officer at the Office of Naval Intelligence. Craven was a close colleague of Bradley, and Craven seems to indicate that NURO actually was a liaison office not just between the CIA and the Navy but also between the CIA and the DIA using officers from Naval Intelligence.John P. Craven, The Silent War ‚Äì The Cold War Battle Beneath the Sea (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2001). Also others indicate that NURO might have been a CIA-DIA liaison office.Ola Tunander, The Secret War against Sweden ‚Äì U.S. and British Submarine Deception in the 1980s (London: Frank Cass, 2004), pp. 259-261. NURO operations were conducted primarily in Soviet home waters using specially equipped nuclear-powered attack submarines or \\"special project submarines\\", but this intelligence gathering was, according to Ola Tunander, just a part of NURO's activity. He refers to a high-ranking CIA officer saying that NURO in the 1980s also ran operations in the waters of friendly countries, such as those of Scandinavia, penetrating into the archipelagos and naval bases of Sweden.Tunander (2004), pp. 254-255, 260-261. United States Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger stated in 2000 that NURO's submarine operations into Swedish waters in the 1980s were run as a \\"routine, regular series of defense testing\\" after US-Swedish Navy-to-Navy consultations.Interview with Caspar Weinberger, Sweden's TV2, 7 March 2000. Transcript of the interview is published in Tunander (2004), pp. 325-329. However, these operations may also have had another purpose. ABC-TV said in 1984 of the U.S. submarine intelligence gathering: \\"Most of the top-secret missions are into the waters of the Soviet Union, but according to both active duty and retired military sources, some missions have been run into the territorial waters of those nations considered friendly to the U.S. Even friendly countries, sources say, sometimes do things they don't want the U.S. to know about, things that could inadvertently threaten U.S. security. The missions are conducted by specially equipped nuclear-powered attack submarines and in some cases by a nuclear-powered mini-sub called NR-1.\\"John McWethy, \\"World News Tonight\\", ABC (21 March 1984). Tunander also says that during this period (1981‚Äì87), the Secretary of Navy John Lehman was the Director of NURO.Ola Tunander, Spelet under ytan [The Game beneath the Surface], Project Report 16, Sverige under det kalla kriget (SUKK) [Sweden during the Cold War] (Gothenburg Univ. & Stockholm Univ., 2007; 2009), p. 389.

It was built around the remains of a former underground Unified Command Post (UPC) for RT-23/SS-24 Molodets ICBM rockets.  History  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine held about one third of the Soviet nuclear arsenal, the third largest in the world at the time, as well as significant means of its design and production. 130 UR-100N/RS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) with six warheads each, 46 RT-23 Molodets ICBMs with ten warheads apiece, as well as 33 heavy bombers, totalling approximately 1,700 warheads remained on Ukrainian territory. In 1994 Ukraine agreed to destroy the weapons, and to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). 40 of the underground launch silos for the RT-23 ICBMs had been installed around the city of Pervomaisk in the Mykolaiv Oblast, the home of the 46th Rocket Division of the 43rd Rocket Army of the Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces. The individual silos were scattered across the general area and often located on fields, surrounded by a fence and guarded. A group of nine or ten silos was connected to a common, underground Unified Command Post manned by several military officers. After the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, the country opted for denuclearization. Between 1994 and 1997 all of the silos near Pervomaisk were de-alerted and the missiles returned to Russia. 30 of the 40 silos were destroyed with the help of foreign experts through the Nunn‚ÄìLugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program. One of the former Unified Command Posts near the town of Pobuzke was converted into the Strategic Missile Forces Museum on October 30, 2001 and is now part of the National Military History Museum in Kiev.  Exhibits  alt=The museum consists of several different parts: * An indoor exhibit space (housed in the former administrative building) with exhibits ranging from World War I weapons to equipment from other Unified Command Posts, including mock-ups of a launch room and sleeping quarters * An outdoor exhibition space * 155 meters of underground passageways between the buildings on the surface and the Unified Command Post * The Unified Command Post * An RT-23/SS-24 missile silo *An extendable communications antenna The RT-23/SS-24 missile silo located inside the museum * A power supply and ventilation building * Parts of the original protection facilities Most of the museum, especially the Unified Command Post, can only be visited on guided tours. The museum also operates a historical and cultural center located off-premises in Pervomaisk. = Outdoor exhibition space = The outdoor exhibition space offers a wide variety of exhibits ranging from rocket engine parts, mock warheads and missiles to military vehicles, helicopters and trains. Among them are models of the R-12/SS-4 missile (which played a key role in the Caribbean crisis of 1961) and an original R-36M/RS-20 missile of which not only the exterior, but also internal components are shown. There are also several MAZ-537 (–ú–ê–ó-537) heavy duty military trucks with various trailers which were used to haul new missiles or even whole command posts to their intended destination. Strategic Missile Forces Museum - missile R-12 = Underground Unified Command Post (UPC) = The Unified Command Post (UCP) is of type KP 15V155/15V252U (–ö–ü 15–í155/15–í52–£) and was designed by the Central Bureau for Transportation Technology (–¶–ö–ë–¢–ú, now part of Roscosmos). It is a 33 meter long, round metal tube, 3.3 meters in diameter and 125 tons in weight. It is located inside a silo three meters below the ground. It consists of eleven compartments which house everything needed to keep the Unified Command Post running autonomously for up to 45 days in case of a nuclear war: * Compartment 1 and 2 (at the top): Emergency Diesel generators * Compartment 3: Communications equipment, connected to the outside antenna * Compartment 4: Automatic control and monitoring * Compartment 5: Communications equipment * Compartment 6 and 8: Electric distribution equipment * Compartment 7: Air Handler equipment * Compartment 9 and 10: Missile control and launch hardware * Compartment 11: The actual command post with the missile remote control, monitoring and communications panels. Two officers would be on duty inside this compartment for six hour shifts. * Compartment 12 (at the bottom): Sleeping and resting quarters for the second crew alt=The power supply and ventilation building located outside of the UCP count as Compartment 0. The individual segments can be reached via an elevator. When the elevator is in its parking position at the top, the metal tube is suspended inside the silo using hydraulic actuators and can move freely to counter the effects of a direct enemy hit. Visitors can take the elevator down to Compartment 11 in pairs during guided tours. The command panels have been set up to simulate a fake rocket launch. When both visitors turn their individual launch keys simultaneously, the controls will light up as if during an actual launch.

John (\\"Jock\\") Paterson (1822 ‚Äì 1880) was a prominent politician and successful businessman of the Cape Colony, and had a great influence on the development of Port Elizabeth where he was based. He ran newspapers, established the Grey Institute and played a significant role in founding South Africa's Standard Bank. As a politician \\"there is no doubt that, as leader of the opposition triumvirate of himself, Sprigg and Southey, he would have been elected Prime Minister when the Molteno Ministry fell\\"{ffolliott and Croft1960p=207}  Early life and business ventures  Born and raised in Aberdeen, Scotland, Paterson studied at Marischal university college and emigrated to Port Elizabeth in 1841 to take up a position as a school master. Later he successfully persuaded Sir George Grey, then the Governor of the Cape Colony, to take an interest in his proposals for new boys schools and Grey made land and funding available to Paterson for their founding. He had a notoriously volatile temperament. On 7 May 1845, he secretly started his first business, the Eastern Province Herald newspaper, with his partner John R. Phillip as the official owner. As he was still contracted by the state this was an illegal activity so his involvement remained clandestine. After the two men fought, Paterson stopped publication in 1850 and started a new newspaper, the Eastern Province News which he soon renamed to the original name in 1854. He later sold the newspaper in 1857 to his friend Robert Godlonton who owned the Grahamstown Journal, though he continued to use the paper as a platform for his opinions. Philip meanwhile had opened the competing Port Elizabeth Mercury newspaper. Paterson was however already a successful businessman. He had made a series of property investments on the outskirts of the expanding town of Port Elizabeth, and a range of other business enterprises. He also briefly served as the Consular Agent for the United States in Port Elizabeth, and gained much American business for his trading firm though this. He had a lifelong interest in boys schools, and founded several in his life, including Grey High School, an elite school for boys in Port Elizabeth that he founded in 1856.  Political career  Paterson's temperament led him to be intensely drawn to politics, from relatively early on. His early activity involved lobbying for increased European immigration, and the widespread anti-convict agitation of 1849. = First Parliamentary term and Eastern Cape separatism (1854-1858)= In 1854 he was elected to the first Cape Parliament as one of the two members for Port Elizabeth (together with Henry Fancourt White). From the beginning of his political career he made the secession of the eastern part of the Cape Colony a priority. He felt very strongly that the Xhosa people of the eastern Cape frontier were a severe threat to the colonists' safety and that this threat was not helped by the Cape government's relaxed attitude to the frontier. The Cape Town parliament at the time was also dominated by liberals such as Saul Solomon who prevented the settlers of the eastern Cape from cheaply exploiting African labour. Deprived of cheap African labour, Paterson then moved a resolution to import indentured \\"coolie labour\\" from Asia to work the farms instead, but the government blocked that motion too. Altogether, Paterson felt that the distant and overly-tolerant Cape government was \\"...the root of all the troubles with the kaffirs...\\". His proposed solution was a view which he held for the remainder of his life - that the white eastern Cape deserved a greater degree of separation, or to become the seat of the Cape's parliament and government. In this, he differed from the radical members of the \\"separatist league\\", who were based further east in Grahamstown, were led by Robert Godlonton, and who proposed absolute and immediate separation. He also angered Godlonton's Grahamstown clique by his blocking of their Kowie harbour proposal, which he saw as potentially taking shipping activity away from Port Elizabeth. The separatist movement began a gradual decline due to a growing fear in the Midlands around Port Elizabeth and Graaff-Reinett that if they attained separation then they would fall under the domination of Grahamstown. He resigned from politics in 1858 due to his wife's fatal illness. = Business interlude (1859-1873)= In 1859 he made a business trip to Britain where he had a great deal of family and business connections, and he even made a bid for a seat in the British parliament, which he eventually decided against. In 1862 he founded Standard Bank, now one of the largest banks in southern Africa. However he later suffered several business failures and declared bankruptcy in 1867. In 1872, the Cape attained self-rule (or \\"responsible government\\" as it was known) and an economic boom ensued as the new locally elected government began vast infrastructure projects across the country. Paterson, financially uplifted by the economic boom, re-entered politics. = Return to Parliament (1872-1877) =  Separatist League (1872-1874) Paterson was elected to the Cape Parliament again in 1873. The enormous growth in the economy was fueling a competition between the ports Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, for the expanding inland trade. Paterson therefore returned to his fight for a moderate form of separation - so as to avoid dominance by either Cape Town to the west, or Grahamstown to the east. In other developments, he put forward bills for a local government system, and for a division of public money according to customs and land revenue, but both bills were defeated. Paterson and his political ally John Gordon Sprigg comprised the core of the opposition to the first Cape government, together with the renegade independent John X. Merriman (who soon joined the government). Paterson's strongest critic was the liberal Saul Solomon, who ridiculed Paterson's ideas. Paterson's role in the \\"Eastern Cape Separatist League\\" also brought him into a direct showdown with the strong-willed Prime Minister of the Cape, John Molteno ‚Äì a firm proponent of regional and racial unity in the Cape ‚Äì who reacted in May 1874 by passing the Seven Circles Act. This re-drew the borders of the Cape‚Äôs subdivisions, abolishing the last legal remnants of the East/West distinction. Together with Molteno's policy of drawing ministers from the Eastern Cape into his government, and the general rising prosperity of the whole country, this effectively crushed the separatist movement. Paterson fought the Bill bitterly, but nonetheless kept his seat in parliament as a member of the opposition once it was passed. He went on to become the primary critic of the Molteno Ministry over the following years, even when the official head of the opposition John X. Merriman joined Molteno's unity government. Not always popular, Paterson's views, and especially the way in which he delivered them, often provoked considerable hostility in parliament. This all too frequently left him isolated and unable to do more than temporarily obstruct government projects.  Enforcement of Confederation (1874-1877) Starting in 1874, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Carnarvon, having recently federated Canada, began a project to impose the very same system of confederation on the very different states of southern Africa. This was to consolidate European control of southern Africa and bring about a united policy towards the Black African inhabitants. Lord Carnarvon also expressed an interest in making Paterson the next Cape Prime Minister, in order to bring this about.Illustrated History of South Africa. The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty) Ltd, 1992. . p.182, \\"Confederation from the Barrel of a Gun\\" John Molteno, Cape Prime Minister and Paterson's lifelong political opponent. There was little local enthusiasm for the project, and its timing was particularly unfortunate ‚Äì coming when the various southern African states were still simmering after the last bout of British imperial expansion. However Carnarvon was determined, and appointed Henry Bartle Frere ‚Äì an autocratic imperialist with little experience of southern African politics ‚Äì as governor, with instructions to implement Carnarvon's confederation. Molteno turned the confederation idea down flat, saying it was impractical and badly timed, but Paterson saw an opportunity to ensure that his eastern province gained autonomy (albeit within the proposed confederation), and that he himself could win the position of leading it. In a series of letters between him and Carnarvon (The Confederation Despatch, 1876), Paterson discreetly offered the British Colonial Office his support against the Molteno government in exchange for vague promises of a future leadership position. Paterson also made a public call for a British invasion and annexation of the Transvaal Republic, for the future confederation. When Molteno, by now furious with Paterson for what he saw as a betrayal of the Cape's independence and democracy, made it clear that he was willing to resign but not to endorse confederation, Frere used the authority of the British Colonial Office to suspend the elected Cape government and assumed direct control in 1878 (appointing Gordon Sprigg as his puppet Prime Minister, instead of Paterson who was at the time considered too divisive a politician for the job). Paterson, disappointed, then travelled to London as a representative of the potential new Eastern Province, while Frere launched his invasion of Zululand in 1879 before being recalled to London to face charges of misconduct. The confederation scheme was dropped, having by now spawned a trail of wars across southern Africa ‚Äì including new frontier wars against the Xhosa and the Pedi people, the Anglo-Zulu war, the Basuto Gun War and later the First Boer War.  Death  Port Elizabeth Observer (a newspaper that supported him). Paterson is shown lecturing the MPs of parliament on budgeting and finance. Paterson died suspiciously on his way back to the Cape in May 1880 in a bizarre double- shipwreck. He initially twice delayed his departure, missing ships, before he boarded the ship the Union R.M.S. American. The American was then dramatically wrecked off West Africa, when its propeller-shaft snapped, bent and tore open part of the ship's plating. The passengers evacuated the ship in an ordered way before it sank but, adrift in the Atlantic Ocean, the lifeboats became separated. The passengers were all later found and rescued. However, Paterson's lifeboat was separately picked up by the Senegal which then ran aground on the coast of Grand Canary Island. In the chaos following this second shipwreck, Paterson was reported to have been struck by a hard object (reportedly the ship's propeller) and killed. He was the only casualty from the two shipwrecks. Upon news of Paterson's death, flags across the Cape were flown at half mast. His obituary in the Cape Argus, while acknowledging the political controversy and hostility he sometimes caused, paid tribute to his zeal for what he believed to be right, and to his enormous achievements. The village of Paterson in the Eastern Cape, South Africa was named after him. Writer Stanley Little commented on Paterson's death and political style in his 1887 work on the Cape's political leaders.

Traditionally the area was part of Carinthia and is now included in the Carinthia Statistical Region.Mislinja municipal site Geography Gornji Doliƒç is a sprawling settlement in hilly terrain in the western part of the Doliƒç Lowland () between the Pohorje Mountains to the north and the Paka Mount Kozjak () to the south. It lies along the main road from Slovenj Gradec to Vitanje and includes the hamlets and isolated farms of Cvetr≈ænik, Globoƒçnik, Golƒçman, Grmiƒç, Hof, Interbo≈ænik, Pantner, Potoƒçnik, Pu≈°nik, and Vodov≈°ek. Surrounding elevations include Peƒçovnik Peak (; ) and Pantner Peak (; ) to the south, and Tiƒçler Peak (; ) to the northeast. The Paka River flows through the settlement. There are meadows in the low-lying areas. There is shallow sandy soil on the hillsides, which is vulnerable to droughts. The hills are covered in mixed pine and beech woods, with interspersed isolated farms. Name The name Gornji Doliƒç (literally, 'upper Doliƒç') distinguishes the village from Srednji Doliƒç (literally, 'middle Doliƒç') and Spodnji Doliƒç (literally, 'lower Doliƒç') . The name dates from the time before what is now the main road was built through the Bad Hole Gorge (). Along the original road from Slovenj Gradec to Vitanje, which passed near Turjak Hill (), it was the highest of the three villages‚Äîbut today's village center is in fact some lower in elevation than the other two villages. The village was known as Zgornji Doliƒç in Slovene until the Second World War, and it was named Oberdollitsch in German in the past. Second World War Gornji Doliƒç was heavily involved in the Second World War. On 1 December 1941 saboteurs dynamited the railroad bridge between Paka pri Velenju and the Bad Hole Gorge (). The Navr≈°nik farm in the settlement was a center of Partisan resistance. Partisan forces dynamited the railway on 31 September 1942, burned the railway station in the settlement on 27 October 1942, attacked and destroyed the railway station again at the end of March 1944, derailed a train into the Huda Luknja Gorge on 10 April 1944, sent a burning train towards Velenje on 25 April 1944 and burned the bus station the same day, burned another train on 26 April 1944, attached a German post in the Huda Luknja Gorge on 3 June 1944, and destroyed the railroad bridge on 18 June 1944 and dynamited the railroad tunnel the same day. Between 12 and 14 May 1945 there was heavy fighting between Mislinja and the Huda Luknja Gorge, resulting in several hundred deaths. =Mass graves= Gornji Doliƒç is the site of seven known mass graves from the period immediately after the Second World War.Ferenc, Mitja & ≈Ωelimir Ku≈æatko. 2007.

Carl Nielsen wrote his Clarinet Concerto for Oxenvad who played at its premiere in 1928.\\"Aage Oxenvad\\", Den Store Danske, Retrieved 16 November 2010. Early life Aage Oxenvad was born in the little village of Gettrup, near Thisted in the north of Jutland on 16 January 1884. As a child, he played the flute for dances with his father, the local musician, until he took up the clarinet when he was 12. He travelled every two weeks to Copenhagen to study with Carl Skjerne, the solo clarinetist with the Royal Danish Orchestra, who had studied under Richard M√ºhlfeld. Oxenvad studied at the Royal Conservatory (1903‚Äì1905) and for a short period in Paris.Eric Nelson, \\"The Nielsen Concerto and Aage Oxenvad\\". Retrieved 16 November 2010. Career Oxenvad joined the Royal Danish Orchestra in 1909 where he was the first to play the Boehm clarinet rather than the Oehler which Skjerne preferred. He was solo clarinetist from 1919 until his death in 1944. In an interview published in connection with his 60th birthday, Oxenvad explained he preferred living in a small house in the suburbs rather than in a flat in the centre where he worked. There he could chat with the local farmers and keep his own garden. He described the clarinet as \\"a living being, and must be treated like a woman, with a gentle yet firm hand...also unpredictable, like a woman...the clarinet is somber and expressive, and it possesses passion...\\" In 1921, after being asked whether he could recommend Oxenvad, Carl Nielsen replied: \\"Mr. Oxenvad‚Äôs abilities and talent are highly exceptional in this country; not only his rare talent and skill as an instrumentalist, but his creative powers and theoretical knowledge are also uncommon. To this I can add that since he is responsive and understanding and his taste is flawless both in old and new art, it can hardly come as a surprise that I give him my very warmest recommendation\\". Oxenvad also greatly admired Carl Nielsen: \\"I loved Carl Nielsen above all...he is Denmark's greatest composer.\\" Perhaps the affinity was based on their similar roots, both being brought up by poor parents living in the country. He was member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet. The first public performance of Nielsen's Wind Quintet by the Copenhagen Wind Quintet was on 9 October 1922. A reviewer of the Clarinet Concerto's premiere on 14 September 1928 noted the great debt the work owed Oxenvad: \\"Hardly a more homogenous interpretation of this work could be imagined. Oxenvad has made a pact with trolls and giants. He has a temper, a primitive force harsh and clumsy, with a smattering of blue-eyed Danish amenity. Surely Carl Nielsen heard the sound of his clarinet when he wrote the Concerto.\\" Assessment On Oxenvad's death in 1944, his colleague Christian Felumb wrote of the great loss to the Royal Orchestra, the Conservatory and to Danish lovers of chamber music: \\"There was always a great festive spirit when Aage played chamber music... He was the undisputed centre of our old wind quintet, whether he was angry or happy... Carl Nielsen's Clarinet Concerto was not just a composition for the clarinet, it was also a concerto for Aage Oxenvad... No words can express what he conveyed in his music. It tells everything about Aage and his clarinet...\\"Sv. Chr. Felumb, \\"Aage Oxenvad\\", Dansk Musik Tidsskrift, 1944, No. 5. Retrieved 16 November 2010.

Function The station was established in Spring 1940 to act as headquarters for No.13 Group whose area encompassed North of the Humber and all of Scotland. The Operations Centre of No. 13 Group was housed there in three buildings (Operations Room, Filter Room and Communications Centre), which were partially buried for protection, in a similar way to buildings for No. 9 Group RAF at RAF Barton Hall, No. 10 Group RAF at RAF Box, No. 11 Group RAF at RAF Uxbridge, No. 12 Group RAF at RAF Watnall and No. 14 Group RAF at Raigmore House. No.13 Group merged with No. 14 Group in July 1943. Operations room () The operations room, responsible for directing RAF aircraft in the No. 13 Group area, was located in a bunker at Kenton Bar. It was fully operational by December 1939. When No.13 Group merged with No. 14 Group in July 1943 the operations room was converted for use as a sector operations room and continued in that use until Summer 1945. The operations room was used as a regional war room from the early 1950s until the early 1960s. Filter room () The Filter room, responsible for filtering large quantities of intelligence on enemy activity before it was passed to the operations room, was located in a bunker at Blakelaw Quarry. It was fully operational by late 1940. When No.13 Group merged with No. 14 Group in July 1943 the filter room was taken out of use. The filter room was acquired by Newcastle City Council and was used as a civil defence centre from 1952 until 1968. The Communications centre has not been found.

Because the signals are only coherent when received, not transmitted, the concept is also sometimes known as coherent on receive. Due to the way the signal is processed, radars using this technique are known as pseudo-coherent radar. COHO can be inexpensively implemented in analog electronics and was widely used in the 1950s into the 1970s. As newer solid- state systems and fully digital processing became inexpensive, COHO became less widely used and is today found only on certain low-cost systems. Description In a basic sense, MTI systems work by comparing two pulses of a pulse-radar's received signals. Moving targets will shift the \\"blips\\" slightly, although this may be too small to see, especially for long-distance radars where the motion of even fast targets may be too small to detect. Instead, MTI subtracts the two signals and then compares the phase of the resulting signal to a reference. Even small motions create phase shifts that can easily be detected by analog phase detectors. Another problem is that MTI requires the pulses to be stored for the length of the pulse repetition frequency. Analogue devices capable of cleanly storing high-frequency signals in the microwave region are not common, so here the solution was to use a much lower frequency intermediate frequency (IF) signal as the basis for the pulse, feeding this into a frequency multiplier before amplification by a device like a klystron. On reception, the signal path is reversed, producing an output similar to the original IF. This lower frequency can be stored in a number of analog devices like an analog delay line. This concept works fine for radars using amplifiers like a klystron, which amplify an input signal. However, the cavity magnetron does not work in this fashion; as a consequence of its physical construction, when fed electrical energy it produces a microwave frequency output in a single step. This makes it impossible to use the simple solution used for klystrons. Further complicating matters is that the output of the magnetron varies from pulse to pulse, slightly in frequency and often strongly in phase. As phase differences are used to detect the targets, this makes the device even more difficult to adapt to MTI. COHO solves these problems by using the output of the magnetron to produce a stable reference signal. It does this by tapping off a small amount of the output using a directional coupler, and then feeding that into the first stages of the receiver. This produces an IF signal that contains the precise phase of the broadcast, typically with outputs in the range of 1 to 60 MHz, suitable for storage in a delay line. This IF signal is first sent to phase locked loop or similar system, providing an accurate and stable reference signal. This portion of the COHO circuitry is known as the stable oscillator or STALO. Objects that are visible to the radar will reflect the signal, and the phase of the signal will depend on its precise distance from the antenna. This returned signal is amplified in the IF section as well. The output from this receiver is then compared with the STALO signal in a phase detector. The detector outputs a signal only where the signals differ in phase, which occurs wherever there is an object. The result is a series of short pulses of output. This signal may be used as the video, and may be sent directly to a radar display. This technique does not itself reveal moving targets, that still requires pulse-to-pulse comparison. This can be accomplished by splitting the output of the phase detector, and sending one half into an acoustic delay line with the same delay time as the pulse repetition frequency. This means the signal from the last pulse will exit the delay at the same time as the next pulse is being received. One of the signals is then inverted, typically from the delay line, and added to the new signal. This results in an output signal only where the two signals changed. If the target is moving, and thus its exact distance is changing relative to the radar, the phase of the received signal will change from pulse to pulse and will produce a signal in the final video. Non-moving targets will have (roughly) the same phase pulse-to-pulse, and their signal will be eliminated. The velocity of the target along the line-of-sight determines the change in phase pulse-to-pulse, so over a series of pulses, the difference in phase will vary. The rate of variation in phase is the same as the Doppler frequency that would be seen in a fully coherent Doppler radar, and can be used to determine the radial speed of the target. A significant disadvantage of the COHO design is that it cannot be used in frequency agile radars. Those change their frequency from pulse to pulse, so pulse-comparison techniques like COHO do not work. For these roles, a coherent signal source like a klystron is needed. It is also difficult to change the parameters of the radar like the pulse width or pulse repetition frequency, as the storage devices were typically implemented in mechanical delays that had to be changed, although a small selection of pre-set selections could be used. COHO was widely used from the early 1950s into the 1960s, but the introduction of increasingly powerful klystrons and newer travelling wave tube systems displaced the magnetron from most military radars by the 1970s. More recent systems based on various solid-state elements are coherent as well. Digital electronics with the performance needed to process and store the signals are now commonplace, allowing COHO-like techniques to be applied to any signal. Independent COHO systems are no longer used except in certain classes of low- cost radars.

In the Orkneyinga saga (written in the 13th century), √ûorri (often written Thorri in English) is a legendary Nordic king, the son of Sn√¶r ('Snow') the Old, a descendant of Fornj√≥t. √ûorri was father of two sons named N√≥r and G√≥r and a daughter named G√≥i ('thin snow, track-snow'). The saga Hversu Noregr bygg√∞ist (\\"How Norway was settled\\", written in the 12th century) states that √ûorri was an ancient king of Finland (which until the 17th century CE referred only to Finland Proper, the southwesternmost part of Finland), K√¶nlandi (which according to the sources was located just north of Finland Proper, i.e. in Satakunta) and Gotland, and that the \\"K√¶nir\\" offered a yearly sacrifice to √ûorri, at mid-winter.English translation of \\"How Norway was settled\\" by Dasent 1894 Mikko Heikkil√§ (2012), On the Etymology of Certain Names in Finnic Mythology (also based on Dasent translation of \\"How Norway was settled\\"), SKY Journal of Linguistics Both the month name and the name of the midwinter sacrifice, √ûorrabl√≥t, are derived from the personal name √ûorri. Orkneyinga saga by contrast states that the √ûorrabl√≥t was established by √ûorri. The name √ûorri has long been identified with that of √û√≥r, the name of the Norse thunder god, or thunder personified.Georg Friedrich Creuzer, Franz Joseph Mone, Symbolik und Mythologie der alten V√∂lker, besonders der Griechen, Heyer und Leske, 1822, p. 275. Probably the √ûorrabl√≥t was in origin a sacrifice dedicated to √û√≥r himself, and the figure of √ûorri is a secondary etymology derived from the name of the sacrifice. Nilsson thinks that the personification of √ûorri \\"frost\\" and Goi \\"track-snow\\" was particular to Iceland.Martin Nilsson, Primitive Time-Reckoning; A Study in the Origins and First Development of the Art of Counting Time (1920), p. 301. The pagan sacrifice of √ûorrabl√≥t disappeared with the Christianisation of Iceland, but in the 19th century, a midwinter festival called √ûorrabl√≥t was introduced in Romantic nationalism, and is still popular in contemporary Iceland, since the 1960s associated with a selection of traditional food, called √ûorramatur. Regardless of actual etymology, it is a popular explanation of the name √ûorri to take it as a diminutive of √û√≥r√Årni Bj√∂rnsson, Icelandic feasts and holidays, 1980, p. 16. and it remains common practice to toast √û√≥r as part of the modern celebration.Andrew Evans, Iceland, Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, , p. 29.

It was the first of a series of major uprisings. Rebels were supported by the Kingdom of Serbia. New taxes levied in the early months of 1910 led to Isa Boletini's activity to convince Albanian leaders who had already been involved in a 1909 uprising to try another revolt against the Ottoman Empire. The Albanian attacks on the Ottomans in Pri≈ütine (now Pristina) and Ferizovik (now Ferizaj), the killing of the Ottoman commander in ƒ∞pek (now Peƒá), and the insurgents' blocking of the railway to Skopje at the Ka√ßanik Pass led to the Ottoman government's declaration of martial law in the area. After two weeks of fierce fighting the Albanian forces withdrew to the Drenica region, whereas the Ottoman army took possession of the cities of Prizren and Yakova (now Gjakova). The Ottomans retook ƒ∞pek on 1 June 1910 and two months later they entered Shkod√´r. The reprisals against the Albanian population included several summary executions, and the burning of many villages and properties. Many schools were closed, and publications in the Albanian alphabet, which had been approved two years earlier, in the Congress of Manastir, were declared illegal. Journalists and publishers were fined or sentenced to death. Events Isa Boletini, one of the leaders of the revolt. During the first months of 1910, Isa Boletini tried to coordinate forces for a new insurrection by visiting the Albanian clans, which had taken refuge in Montenegro after the failure of a previous minor uprising in 1909. In the meantime the new governor, Masar Bey, introduced a new tax on commodities, which immediately became highly unpopular. Albanian leaders held two other meetings in ƒ∞pek (now Peƒá) and Ferizovi√ß (now Ferizaj), where they took the oath of besa to be united against the new Ottoman government policy of centralization. Forces led by Isa Boletini attacked the Ottoman forces in Pristina and Ferizovi√ß, while the commander of Ottoman forces in Peƒá was killed by the local population. The Ottoman government declared martial law and sent a military expedition of 16,000 men led by Shefqet Turgut Pasha who went to Skopje in April 1910. Idriz Seferi, one of the leaders of the rebellion. At the same time 3,000 Albanians under Idriz Seferi blocked the railway to Skopje at the Ka√ßanik Pass. They captured a train conveying soldiers and military supplies to the Ottoman garrison of Pristina, disarmed the soldiers and held the supplies. The Ottoman forces attacked the Ka√ßanik Pass but the resistance given there by the Albanians led by Idriz Seferi made it clear that the 16,000 Ottoman forces were insufficient to crush the rebellion so their numbers increased to 40,000 men. After two weeks of fierce fighting, the Ottoman forces captured the Ka√ßanik Pass and attacked the Albanian forces led by Isa Boletini and Hasan Budakova, which meanwhile were blocking the Ferizovik-Prizren road to Carraleva Pass. Superior in numbers, the Ottoman forces tried at first a frontal attack but the stiff resistance offered made them change their tactics. They made a pincer movement, trying to encircle the Albanian forces in Carralevo pass. After three days of fighting the Albanian forces withdrew to the Drenica region. Ottoman forces entered Prizren in the middle of May 1910. They proceeded to Yakova and ƒ∞pek where they entered on June 1, 1910. By government orders part of the force proceeded in the direction of Scutari (now Shkod√´r), while another column marched toward the Debre region (now known as Dib√´r in Albania, and Debar in the Republic of North Macedonia). The first column marching to Scutari managed to capture the Morin√´ pass, after fighting with the Albanian forces of Gash, Krasniq and Byty√ß areas, led by Zeqir Halili, Abdulla Hoxha, and Shaban Binaku. Ottoman forces were stopped for more than 20 days in the Agri Pass, from the Albanian forces of Shal√´, Shosh√´, Nikaj and M√´rtur areas, led by Prel Tuli, Mehmet Shpendi, and Marash Delia. Unable to repress their resistance, this column took another way to Scutari, passing from the Puk√´ region. On July 24, 1910, Ottoman forces entered the city of Scutari (now known as Shkod√´r). During this period martial courts were put in action and summary executions took place. A large number of firearms were collected and many villages and properties were burned by the Ottoman army. The Ottoman army, made up of irregular Kurds, flogged the leaders in public, burnt villages, and drove some 150,000 from their homes, two thirds being Serbs. Aftermath Although the numbers of the Ottoman forces were now up to 50,000, they controlled only the lowlands and the cities, and failed to take control of the mountainous regions. At the request of the Ottoman commander Mehmet Shefqet Pasha, the Ottoman government declared the abrogation of the \\"Lek√´ Dukagjini Code\\" which was the mountain law of the Albanian clans. Some Albanian clans went to seek refuge in Montenegro, requesting an amnesty from the Ottoman government and the return of the conditions obtained before the rebellion. This was not accepted by the Ottoman government, which also declared the prohibition of the Albanian alphabet and books published in it. Albanian-language schools were declared illegal, and possessing a book in Albanian letters became a penal act. Strong through numbers and position, the Ottoman expedition continued its march towards central and southern Albania imposing the new prohibitions. Albanian schools were closed and publications in the Latin alphabet were declared illegal. A number of journalists and publishers were fined or sentenced to death while the entry of Albanian books published outside the Ottoman Empire was prohibited. After these events, Albania became a wasteland for Albanian patriots, and Albanian culture was fully oppressed. One year later, Sultan Mehmed V visited Pristina and declared an amnesty for all who had participated in the revolt, except for those who had committed murder. The Albanian revolts of 1910 and 1912 were a turning point that impacted the Young Turk government which increasingly moved from a policy direction of pan-Ottomanism and Islam toward a singular national Turkish outlook...

It is about 100 kilometres long and was built by the Royal Bavarian State Railways as part of the Ludwig's Western Railway () from Bamberg via Ha√üfurt and Schweinfurt to W√ºrzburg. Between Bamberg and Schweinfurt, the line runs largely along the Main river. The line was opened in sections between 1852 and 1854 and is one of the oldest railways in Germany. History  Before the completion of the modern direct route via Rottendorf, Kitzingen, Neustadt an der Aisch and F√ºrth, which could not initially be built because of the difficult terrain in the Steigerwald area, the eastern part of the Ludwig's Western Railway was of great importance for east-west long-distance traffic. As a result of the opening of the direct line in 1865, the W√ºrzburg‚ÄìBamberg line is now mainly significant for regional and local transport. Until the division of Germany in 1945, more long-distance trains to Thuringia and Saxony used the W√ºrzburg‚ÄìSchweinfurt line than the line via Hof. In 1978, faster regional services were established, accompanied by the closure of several stations, as was the case on many lines in Germany during the 1970s and 1980s. InterRegio train services ran on the Stuttgart‚ÄìW√ºrzburg‚ÄìSchweinfurt‚ÄìErfurt route from soon after German reunification until 2001. =Opening dates = The line was opened in three stages from Bamberg from 1852 to 1854: *1 August 1852: Bamberg‚ÄìHa√üfurt *3 November 1852: Ha√üfurt‚ÄìSchweinfurt *1 July 1854: Schweinfurt‚ÄìW√ºrzburg Further development of the line to create additional capacity to handle increased traffic was necessary over the years: *1897: duplication between Schweinfurt and Waigolshausen *1905‚Äì1908: duplication between Bamberg and Schweinfurt and between Waigolshausen and W√ºrzburg *1984: adding of the third line between W√ºrzburg and Rottendorf In addition, on 1 July 1864, a new railway station was opened in W√ºrzburg, as the old Ludwigsbahnhof (Ludwig‚Äôs station) in the city centre had to be closed because it was unable to cope with the increase in traffic. =Electrification = In 1954 and in 1971 and 1972 overhead wire was erected over the track in three sections: *3 October 1954: W√ºrzburg‚ÄìRottendorf *22 September 1971: Waigolshausen‚ÄìBamberg *26 May 1972: Rottendorf‚ÄìWaigolshausen Current services Seligenstadt (b W√ºrzburg) station Regionalbahn train between Seligenstadt and Rottendorf A Regio-Shuttle of the Erfurter Bahn in Schweinfurt Stadt station Since the timetable change in December 2004, Regional-Express trains have run every two hours, generally with two routes overlapping to provide hourly services on most sections. Specifically, trains run on the following lines: *W√ºrzburg‚ÄìSchweinfurt‚ÄìBad Kissingen/Mellrichstadt‚ÄìSuhl‚ÄìErfurt *W√ºrzburg‚ÄìSchweinfurt‚ÄìHa√üfurt‚ÄìBamberg‚ÄìLichtenfels‚ÄìHof/Bayreuth *W√ºrzburg‚ÄìSchweinfurt‚ÄìHa√üfurt‚ÄìBamberg‚ÄìForchheim‚ÄìErlangen‚ÄìF√ºrth‚ÄìN√ºrnberg Modern vehicles are exclusively used on the three lines. The first two lines because of their winding routes are operated with class 612 tilting trains, mostly in sets of three. From December 2004, services on the Schweinfurt‚ÄìNuremberg route were hauled at first by class 111 locomotives with five double-deck carriages (built in 1997), but with a top speed of 140 km / h only. However, the one- hour service required to allow regular connections to and from trains on the Erfurt‚ÄìW√ºrzburg line made trains with a stop speed of 160 km / h necessary. DB Regio therefore procured eight new five-car sets, which have been hauled since December 2005 by eight new class 146 locomotives, saving several minutes on the line. Regional-Express trains stop only at the stations of Bamberg, Ha√üfurt, Schweinfurt and W√ºrzburg on the 100-kilometre route. Regionalbahn services also supplement the Regional Express train services. Services run hourly on the W√ºrzburg‚ÄìSchweinfurt line, continuing every two hours to Bamberg. Trains terminating in Schweinfurt in some cases continue to Schweinfurt Stadt station. On the Ha√üfurt‚ÄìBamberg section extra services run, increasing services to an hourly frequency. The trains are usually composed of a class 111 or class 143 locomotives and four or five Silberling carriages.

Joseph Potaski worked hard to establish himself as a successful farmer in colonial Hobart. This was however undone by the exploits of his family. Joseph Potaski reflects the attitudes of those convicts who never progressed beyond their criminal past. Potaski is seen as representing the auspicious beginning of the Polish community in Australia. His daughter, Catherine, was the first European born and baptised in the new colony of Van Diemen's Land. Early life It is estimated that Potaski was born in 1764, in Poland. Not much is known of his early life. It has been suggested that Potaski was born into the aristocratic family of Potocki. It is also known that Potaski was a member of Kosciuszko's army. During this time Potaski would have been involved in the Warsaw siege and the Praga massacre. After the war Joseph Potaski arrived in London, probably as a refugee or asylum seeker. Transportation On 27 March 1802, Potaski was arraigned before the Sussex Spring Assizes at Horsham, Sussex. Along with a John O'Brien, he faced charges of stealing a woman's hair shawl from Mrs. Pollard's shop in Newhaven, Sussex. Potaski was sentenced to several years' transportation to Australia. He was transported on the ship . His wife, Catherine and infant son, Joseph, also accompanied Potaski, as free settlers. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel David Collins, the Calcutta left Portsmouth, and arrived at Port Phillip Bay on 9 October 1803. Collins was charged with establishing a new settlement, at present-day Sorrento. However, he found the area to be unsuitable for settlement and departed on 20 January 1804 for Hobart. This time the Potaskis travelled on Ocean, which anchored at Risdon Cove on 17 February 1804. It was at this time that Catherine Potaski gave birth to a daughter, Catherine Jnr., the first person of European descent to be born and baptised in Tasmania. Potaski's wife, Catherine was granted land at Clarence Plains, and Potaski himself received his freedom in 1810. By 1816 the Potaski family was supplying the colony with more corn than was needed for a whole year. The Potaskis also supplied the whole commissariat with wheat. Family Catherine McDonald (n√©e Potaski), 1804‚Äì1877. Courtesy of the Tasmanian Archive and Heritage Office Joseph Potaski's, son Joseph Jnr. was convicted in March 1821 at Sydney, New South Wales, for being a part of a party that burgled Mr. Thrupp's house. Potaski Jnr. was hanged for the crime at Hobart on 28 April 1821. Joseph's sister, Catherine, had also been in trouble. In 1820, at the age of 16, Catherine had given birth to an illegitimate son, William. William died in 1823, at the age of three years. Catherine had also been accused of being a prostitute, and didn't enjoy the favour of Hobart's first Catholic chaplain, Father Connelly. However, Catherine was able to recover. She married on 29 June 1824, to Irishmen Edward McDonald, at St. Virgils church, Hobart, Tasmania. Catherine and Edward had a large family, and eventually migrated to Lara, Victoria. Catherine died in Geelong, Victoria on 30 January 1877. Legacy In the years before his death Potaski was once again in trouble with the law, this time for cattle rustling. He died on 31 August 1824 at Hobart. After his death the Potaskis left their land and migrated to Victoria. Potaski's wife, Catherine, died in 1859 at Geelong, Victoria. Joseph Potaski is immortalised on a plaque in Hobart's St. David's Memorial Park. On 9 October 2003, a concert was held in Hobart, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Joseph Potaski arriving in Australia. Television presenter Yumi Stynes, and politician Denis Napthine are amongst the Potaski descendants.

It was released on November 2, 2010. History The Lyraka opera was first conceived by Jasmine Aliara in 2006. Her plans were for a multimedia fantasy experience: movie, website, video game, and a line of Ken Kelly artwork. Upon creating the characters and storyline for the original screenplay, she enlisted Andy DiGelsomina to begin writing music for the project. At first DiGelsomina's role was to score the script as a soundtrack, but as work progressed the project developed into a full blown metal opera. According to DiGelsomina's blog, \\"Lyraka as a musical project draws inspiration from the operas of The Who, King Diamond, and Richard Wagner, as well as the guitar hero stylings and concept albums of Uli Jon Roth.\\" Characters *Neires: The main character of the story, a young man that loves heavy metal and guitar. *Lilliput: Queen of the desert land Errandia. *Semmonet: Neires' father, the vizier of Lilliput. *Empress Jasmine: Monarch of the underwater sovereign, Lyraka. *Locke: Head of Lyraka's palace guard. *Scatherus: The serpentine ruler of the abyss. The Plot The plot itself centers around the protagonist Neires, a rebellious metal head who finds an enchanted guitar and embarks upon a journey to find himself. The antagonists are Semmonet, Lilliput, and Scatherus. The Lyraka lyrics are influenced by the writings of Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, and S√∏ren Kierkegaard, and are essentially allegorical. =Coronation= This song serves as an invitation to the opera, and coincidentally introduces a recurrent theme: the reinforcement of belief in an ideal via repetition, vivid imagery, and hyperbole. Through the use of these techniques, the protagonists of this song make the underwater empire of Lyraka seem to be a paradise, abstractly conceived and thus inherently imperfect. Another primary theme introduced in the song is the dichotomy between the \\"world above\\" (Errandia, desert), and \\"below\\" (Lyraka, oceanic). These two landmarks are based upon archetypes that the psychoanalyst Carl Jung expanded upon. The ocean depths represent the inner depths of subjective experience, while the desert symbolizes the \\"real world\\", or how \\"others\\" see you. The desert also represents the place where one takes his or her dreams, in order to subject them to the harshness of reality and thereby submit to them to trial by fire. How the landmarks oppose, interact, and complement each other is a vital variable in the development of the Lyraka story. The song features Graham Bonnet on vocals. =Scatherus= The opera character Scatherus is the anthropomorphic representation of despair, with lyrics influenced by both psychoanalyst Carl Jung's writings on the \\"shadow\\" portion of the psyche, as well as Saint Augustine's writings on the \\"felix culpa\\" and its relation to the Fall of Man. The lyrics refer to Scatherus as being an \\"entropic void\\", asserting that when the emptiness of despair is used as the quantitative measure of disorder in human experience, it reveals itself to be a vital, positive constant. This song features Veronica Freeman on vocals. =Beyond the Palace= This song features Graham Bonnet on vocals again, singing as the musical narrator. The song closes the album for good reason: following the despair and negativity in the suite \\"Scatherus-Errandia- Neires\\", \\"Beyond the Palace\\" attempts a reaffirmation of the starry-eyed ideals introduced earlier in the album, by both \\"Coronation\\" and \\"Palace Guard\\". The song is the most repetitive of the set, because mindful reinforcement can be required to continue belief in lofty ideals. Nietzsche's concept of self-overcoming is manifest in the lyrics \\"(by) knowing that it had to happen, you redeem your past\\". There are instances of irony in the track as well, most evidenced when Bonnet sings \\"ascend beyond the rainbow, all your fears are through\\", his voice cracking on \\"through\\".http://andydigelsomina.blogspot.com/2011/06/allegory-and- psychological-motif-in.html Reception Critic and author Martin Popoff was very complimentary toward the album, calling it a \\"strangely irresistible yet measured flood of fresh, catchy, creative, NWOBHM-ish ideas that draw you to the conclusion that with a pile of work, this is the next Led Zeppelin.\\" Peter Makowski of Classic Rock writes that \\"the whole concept screams box office disaster, but somehow it works\\" and \\"at its best\\" the album \\" sounds like a tasty hybrid of Dio circa Rainbow, Iron Maiden, and early Metallica with a touch of Manowar.\\" Metal Rules highly recommends the album, with the review highlighting the unusual composition of the songs and the use of a 1970s sound \\"blended with some Power Metal and (...) lots of instrumentation, orchestrations and long arrangements.\\" Track listing All music and lyrics composed by Andy DiGelsomina #\\"Coronation\\" - 5:10 #\\"Palace Guard\\" - 7:43 #\\"Scatherus\\" - 3:54 #\\"Errandia\\" - 12:32 #\\"Neires\\" - 5:21 #\\"Beyond the Palace\\" - 6:13 Personnel *Andy DiGelsomina - Electric Lead Guitar Solos, all Music and Lyric composition, Orchestration, Co-producer. *Andre Maquera - Co- producer, Mastering, Engineering, Rhythm and Acoustic/Nylon-string Guitars. *Jasmine Aliara - Opera Concept, Story, Characters *Graham Bonnet - lead & backing vocals on \\"Coronation\\", \\"Palace Guard\\", \\"Errandia\\", and \\"Beyond the Palace\\". *Thom Carvey - bass, saxophone *Gary Spaulding - drums, percussion *Hannah Beth Crary - Solo Violin *Tommy Heart - lead & backing vocals on \\"Neires\\". *Veronica Freeman - lead & backing vocals on \\"Scatherus\\". *Jeff Pilson - Vocal Engineering for Veronica Freeman. *Ken Kelly - Cover Art.

The groom, Prince William, is second in the line of succession to the British throne. The bride, Catherine Middleton, had been his girlfriend since 2003. The Dean of Westminster, John Hall, presided at the service; the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, conducted the marriage; Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London, preached the sermon; and a reading was given by the bride's brother, James. William's best man was his brother, Prince Harry, while the bride's sister, Pippa, was maid of honour. The ceremony was attended by the bride's and groom's families, as well as members of foreign royal dynasties, diplomats, and the couple's chosen personal guests. After the ceremony, the couple made the traditional appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. As Prince William was not the heir apparent to the throne, the wedding was not a full state occasion and many details were left to the couple to decide, such as much of the guest list of about 1,900. Prince William and Kate Middleton met in 2001. Their engagement on 20 October 2010 was announced on 16 November 2010. The build-up to the wedding and the occasion itself attracted much media attention, being compared in many ways with the marriage of William's parents in 1981. The occasion was a public holiday in the United Kingdom and featured many ceremonial aspects, including use of the state carriages and roles for the Foot Guards and Household Cavalry. Events were held around the Commonwealth to mark the wedding; organisations and hotels held events across Canada, over 5,000 street parties were held throughout the United Kingdom, and one million people lined the route between Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace. The ceremony was viewed live by tens of millions more around the world, including 72 million live streams on YouTube. In the United Kingdom, television audiences peaked at 26.3 million viewers, with a total of 36.7 million watching part of the coverage. Engagement announcement In 2001, Middleton and Prince William met while studying at the University of St Andrews. They began dating in 2003. On 16 November 2010, Clarence House stated that Prince William was to marry Catherine Middleton \\"in the Spring or Summer of 2011, in London\\". They were engaged in October 2010, while on a private holiday in Kenya; Prince William gave Middleton the same engagement ring that his father had given to William's mother, Diana, Princess of Wales‚Äîan 18-karat white gold ring with a 12-carat oval Ceylon (Sri Lankan) sapphire and 14 round diamonds. It was announced at approximately the same time that, after their marriage, the couple would live on the Isle of Anglesey in Wales, where Prince William was based with the Royal Air Force. Days before the wedding, dozens of Union Flags were hung in Regent Street. The Queen said she was \\"absolutely delighted\\" for the couple, giving her formal consent to the marriage, as required by the since repealed Royal Marriages Act 1772, in her British privy council on the morning of the engagement. Congratulations also came in from the Queen's prime ministers, including Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard, who has at other times demonstrated moderate republican leanings. The suffragan Bishop of Willesden, Pete Broadbent, who also has republican views, published a critical reaction to the wedding announcement on Facebook. He later acknowledged that his words were \\"offensive\\" and subsequently apologised, but his superior, Richard Chartres, Bishop of London, instructed him to withdraw from public ministry \\"until further notice\\". Following the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to ITV News political editor Tom Bradby and hosted a photocall at St James's Palace. On 12 December 2010, Buckingham Palace issued the official engagement photographs; these were taken on 25 November, in the state apartments at St. James's Palace, by photographer Mario Testino. On 23 November 2010, the date of the ceremony was confirmed as Friday 29 April 2011. The Queen in her British Council ordered on 15 December 2010 that the wedding day would be a public holiday throughout the United Kingdom. It was also declared an official public holiday in the British Overseas Territories of Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos, and the British Crown Dependencies of Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man. As 29 April fell six days before elections for the Scottish Parliament and the Alternative Vote referendum, this attracted political comment. John Curtice, a professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, stated for the Scottish elections that the date was \\"unfortunate\\" and was \\"likely to see the Royal Family getting caught up in political debate\\". TV programmes were also shown in the UK prior to the wedding which provided deeper insights into the couple's relationship and backgrounds, including When Kate Met WilliamRewind TV: When Kate Met William; Kate and William: Romance and the Royals; The Suspicions of Mr Whicher; The Crimson Petal and the White The Observer, 1 May 2011 and Channel 4's Meet the Middletons.TV review: Meet the Middletons; Help! My House is Infested; The Reckoning The Guardian, 18 April 2011 Planning :Note: All times are in British Summer Time (UTC+01:00) On 5 January, St James's Palace publicised that the ceremony would start at 11:00 local time and that the bride would arrive at the abbey by car rather than by carriage (the latter is the traditional transport for royal brides). The route planned was along The Mall, through Horse Guards Parade, and down Whitehall to the abbey. Beforehand, motorists were warned about using the roads in central London on the wedding day, including by Transport for London, which issued travel advice on road closures.London24 =Cost= On the evening of the wedding, the alt=Ferris wheel at night illuminated by blue, red and white The costs of the wedding itself were borne by the Royal Family and the Middletons themselves, while the costs of security and transport were covered by Her Majesty's Treasury. The couple also asked that donations be made to charities in place of traditional wedding gifts; to that end, they established The Prince William and Miss Catherine Middleton Charitable Gift Fund, which focuses on assisting charities such as the New Zealand Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary, the Royal Flying Doctor Service, and the Zoological Society of London. The overall price of the event was reportedly ¬£23.7 million. The Australian newspaper Herald Sun estimated A$32 million for security and A$800,000 for flowers. Estimates of the cost to the economy of extra public holidays, such as that allowed for the wedding, vary between ¬£1.2 billion and ¬£6 billion.The ¬£2.9bn Royal wedding Bank Holiday Channel 4 Fact Check Blog The British government tourist authority VisitBritain predicted the wedding would trigger a tourism boom that would last several years, eventually pulling in an additional 4 million visitors and generating ¬£2 billion. However, VisitBritain's head of research and forecasting, David Edwards, suggested to colleagues two days after the engagement was announced that the evidence points to royal weddings having a negative impact on inbound tourism. He noted that the number of visitors to Britain was down significantly in July 1981, when Prince Charles and Diana were married, from the same period in other years, and also July 1986, when Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson were married, was down from July 1985. =Guest list= On 16 and 17 February, three sets of guest lists were sent out in the name of the Queen. Many guests or their successors in office, who were invited to the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer were not invited to William's wedding. The first list, consisting of about 1,900 people, attended the ceremony in the abbey; the second list of approximately 600 people were invited to the luncheon reception at Buckingham Palace, hosted by the Queen; and the final list, of about 300 names, was for the evening dinner hosted by the Prince of Wales. More than half of the guests to attend the wedding itself were family and friends of the couple, though there was a significant number of Commonwealth leaders (including the governors-general who represent the Queen in Commonwealth realms other than the UK, prime ministers of the Commonwealth realms, and heads of government of other Commonwealth countries), members of religious organisations, the diplomatic corps, several military officials, members of the British Royal Household, members of foreign royal families, and representatives of William's charities and others with whom William has worked on official business. Although St James's Palace declined to publish the names of those invited, a breakdown of guests was published by category; the list made no mention of foreign heads of state. The invitation of Se√°n Cardinal Brady, Primate of All Ireland, to the event, and its acceptance, were described as \\"unprecedented\\" by a spokesman for Ireland's Catholic bishops. The spokesman attributed the invitation to Cardinal Brady's contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process.Cardinal to attend royal wedding after 'unprecedented' invitation The Irish Times 20 April 2011 =Route= Route of the groom to and of the bride and groom from the ceremony at Westminster Abbey The route of the groom and his party to the ceremony went between Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey, by The Mall, passing Clarence House, by Horse Guards Road, Horse Guards Parade, through Horse Guards Arch, Whitehall, the south side of Parliament Square, and Broad Sanctuary. After the ceremony, the bridal couple returned along the same route by carriage. At 6.00 am, roads in and around the processional route were closed to traffic. From 8.15 am, the main congregation, governors-general, prime ministers of Commonwealth realms, and diplomats all arrived at the abbey. Princes William and Harry, who had stayed at Clarence House, left for the ceremony at 10.10 am in a Bentley State Limousine and arrived at 10.18 am, followed by representatives of foreign royal families, the Middleton family, and, lastly, the Royal Family (the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall; the Princess Royal and Vice Admiral Timothy Laurence; the Duke of York, Princess Beatrice, and Princess Eugenie; and the Earl and Countess of Wessex). The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were the last members of the Royal Family to leave Buckingham Palace, as is tradition, arriving at the abbey for 10.48 am. The bridal party, who had spent the night at the Goring Hotel, left for the ceremony in the former number one state Rolls-Royce Phantom VI at 10.52 am,The Times Guide to the Royal Wedding in time for the service to begin at 11.00 am. The service finished at 12.15 pm, after which the newly married couple travelled to Buckingham Palace in a procession consisting of other Royal Family members, the parents of the groom and bride, and the best man and the bridesmaids. At 1.25 pm, the couple appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to watch a flypast of an Avro Lancaster bomber, a Supermarine Spitfire fighter, and a Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, followed by two Typhoons from RAF Coningsby and two Tornado GR4s from RAF Leuchars in a flat diamond formation. Ceremony =Venue= Westminster Abbey has been the venue for coronations and some royal weddings. Westminster Abbey, founded in AD 960, has a particular status and is known as a Royal Peculiar. Although the abbey has been the traditional location for coronations since 1066, not until the 20th century did it become the church of choice for royal weddings; prior to 1918, most royal weddings took place in the royal chapels, such as the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace and St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. The abbey, which has a usual seating capacity of 2000, has been the venue for most royal weddings in the last century, including those of William's grandparents (the present Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip) in 1947, William's great-aunt Princess Margaret in 1960, William's first cousin twice removed Princess Alexandra in 1963, William's aunt Princess Anne in 1973, and William's uncle Prince Andrew in 1986. A prominent decorative addition inside the abbey for the ceremony was an avenue of 20-foot tall trees, six field maple and two hornbeams, arranged on either side of the main aisle. =Menu= The menu for the Royal wedding breakfast remained a secret for several years until a copy of the menu was sold at auction. South Uist salmon, Lyme Bay crab and Hebridean langoustines were served as appetizers, followed by North Highland organic lamb with spring vegetables, English asparagus and Jersey Royal potatoes. The lamb came from Prince Charles' organic farm. There were three desserts: Berkshire honey ice cream, sherry trifle and chocolate parfait with a glass of Rose champagne. The main cake was an eight-tier fruit cake decorated with Lamberth piping. At the Prince's request, chocolate biscuit cake was prepared as a groom's cake. This icebox cake is a favorite tea cake of the Prince, his late mother Princess Diana and Queen =Bridal party= In a break with royal tradition, the groom had a best man‚Äîhis brother, Prince Harry‚Äîrather than a supporter, while the bride chose her sister, Pippa, as maid of honour. There were four bridesmaids and two page boys: Lady Louise Windsor, the seven-year-old daughter of the Earl and Countess of Wessex; Margarita Armstrong-Jones, the eight-year-old daughter of Viscount and Viscountess Linley; Grace van Cutsem, the three-year-old daughter of the couple's friend, Hugh van Cutsem; Eliza Lopes, the three-year- old granddaughter of the Duchess of Cornwall; William Lowther-Pinkerton, the ten-year-old son of William's private secretary, Major Jamie Lowther- Pinkerton; and Tom Pettifer, the eight-year-old son of Princes William and Harry's former nanny, \\"Tiggy\\" Pettifer. =Wedding attire= Bride Duchess of Cambridge in bridal gown The bridal dress, designed by the London- based designer Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen, was made of satin and featured an overlaid lace bodice and appliqued skirt.

It was purchased by the Queen's father, the future King George VI, for his wife Elizabeth three weeks before his accession. Princess Elizabeth (now Queen received the tiara from her mother on her 18th birthday. In order to avoid her tiara falling off, as had happened for Lady Diana Spencer while wearing a Spencer family tiara during her 1981 wedding to the Prince of Wales, Catherine's stylists \\"backcombed the top [of her hair] to create a foundation for the tiara to sit around, then did a tiny plait in the middle and sewed it on.\\" For the customary bridal themes of \\"Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue\\", Middleton's gown had lace appointments (the \\"old\\"), diamond earrings given by her parents (the \\"new\\"), the Queen's tiara (the \\"borrowed\\"), and a blue ribbon sewn into the bodice (the \\"blue\\"). The shoes were also from Alexander McQueenKate Middleton's Shoes: your views? and had a lace pattern matching the dress with appliques made by the Royal School of Needlework.Kate Middleton‚Äôs Wedding Shoes The bride's shield-shaped wired bouquet, designed by Derek Connolly, contained myrtle, Lily of the Valley, Sweet William and hyacinth. Middleton's hair was styled in loose curls for the occasion by hair dresser James Pryce of the Richard Ward Salon. She received private make-up lessons from Arabella Preston and the entire bridal party received \\"makeup artistry assistance\\" from Bobbi Brown make-up artist Hannah Martin prior to the event, but ultimately Middleton did her own makeup for the occasion. The look was described as a \\"soft smokey eye\\" with pink lips and cheeks. Her nails were painted by manicurist Marina Sandoval in a mixture of two polishes: a \\"barely there pink\\" and a \\"sheer beige\\" to complement her skin tone and gown. Bridal attendants Maid-of-honour Pippa Middleton also wore a gown by Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen. It has been described as being made of \\"heavy, ivory satin-based crepe, with a cowl front and with the same button detail and lace trims as the Bride's dress.\\" Like her sister, she received \\"makeup artistry assistance\\" from Bobbi Brown make-up artist Hannah Martin, but it is unclear who actually put on her makeup for the wedding day. Her hair was loosely curled in a half-up, half-down style by the Richard Ward Salon with a deep side part and a hairpiece made of ivy and lily of the valley to match Catherine's bouquet. The young bridesmaids wore dresses designed by Nicki Macfarlane, handmade with the help of Macfarlane's daughter Charlotte, in their homes at Wiltshire and Kent. The gowns echoed the bride's dress and were made with the same fabrics and button detail along the back. They were described as having a \\"ballerina-length, full, box pleated skirt\\" and were hand finished with English Cluny lace. Their ivy and lily-of-the- valley hair wreaths were influenced by Catherine's mother Carole's headdress at her 1981 wedding to Michael Middleton. All of the bridesmaids wore satin Mary Jane style shoes with a Swarovski crystal buckle designed by Devon-based Rainbow Club. Their flowers were designed and made by Shane Connolly and replicated the flowers in Catherine's bouquet: lily-of-the-valley, sweet William, and hyacinth. The pageboys' outfits were designed by Kashket and Partners in the style worn by a \\"Foot Guard officer at the time of the Regency (the 1820s)\\" with an insignia from the Irish Guards, whose Colonel is Prince William. The tunics are red with gold piping and have Irish shamrocks on the collars. The Pages wore a gold and crimson sash (with tassel) around their waists, as is tradition for officers in the Irish Guards when in the presence of a member of the Royal Family. Groom and best man Prince William in uniform Prince William wore an Irish Guards mounted officer's uniform in Guard of Honour Order with a forage cap, rather than the bearskin hat. As a serving Royal Air Force flight lieutenant who also held the equivalent Royal Navy rank of lieutenant and army rank of captain in the Blues and Royals, William could have chosen to wear the uniform of any of these junior officer ranks. However, as he had been appointed colonel of the Irish Guards on 10 February 2011, he opted instead to wear the full dress uniform of that regiment. As a Knight of the Order of the Garter, he wore the order's star and blue riband, to which were affixed his RAF wings and Golden Jubilee Medal. William did not wear a sword in the church. Prince Harry wore the uniform of a captain of the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons), with a forage cap. He wore aiguillettes, a cross-belt and gold waist belt with sword slings, but no sword. He wore the wings of the Army Air Corps and Golden Jubilee and Afghanistan Campaign medals. Designer Russell Kashket worked with the Princes to address concerns they had with the outfits. One such concern was the heat of the Abbey, so the designers used special material to absorb the heat while still achieving the desired look. Further, military dress uniforms do not traditionally have pockets, but the palace requested that some sort of compartment be added to Harry's outfit so that Catherine's wedding ring would not be lost. =Wedding service= The order of service chosen by the bridal couple was the Series One form which is virtually identical with that of the 1928 Prayer Book.see Liturgy Used at the Royal Wedding official Church of England website The Dean of Westminster, John Hall, officiated for most of the service, with Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, as celebrant of the marriage and Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London, preaching the sermon. It has long been traditional for the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Church of England's most senior bishop, to officiate at the weddings of England's monarchs and future monarchs. Chartres is a close friend of the Prince of Wales and confirmed both Prince William and Kate Middleton.Kate Middleton confirms her faith for the big day , Evening Standard, 13 April 2011 The service commenced with the procession of the Queen, Prince Philip and the clergy. Shortly after, Middleton arrived with the party of maid of honour and junior attendants. As the choir sang \\"I was glad\\", an anthem by Sir Hubert Parry composed in 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII, the bride made her three-and-a-half-minute procession through the nave and choir on her father's arm, to meet Prince William. The service proceeded with the formal service and congregational singing of three well known hymns, fanfares, anthems, organ and orchestral music. In the marriage vows, the couple promised to \\"love, comfort, honour and keep\\" each other. This was sealed by the exchange of a single ring. The lesson, read by the bride's brother, James Middleton, was from the Epistle to the Romans (Chapter 12, verses 1‚Äì2 and 9‚Äì18) and is an exhortation to live a righteous and peaceful life.\\"Royal Wedding: Williams greets fans ahead of wedding\\", 28 April 2011. Retrieved 29 April 2011. The sermon, preached by the Bishop of London, commenced with a quotation from Catherine of Siena whose feast day it was. The bishop urged the couple to live selflessly, each remembering the needs of each other and seeking to transform each other by love rather than seeking to reform. He ended the sermon with a prayer composed by the couple themselves:The Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton sermon by Richard Chartres. Official text > God our Father, we thank you for our families; for the love that we share > and for the joy of our marriage. In the busyness of each day keep our eyes > fixed on what is real and important in life and help us to be generous with > our time and love and energy. Strengthened by our union help us to serve and > comfort those who suffer. We ask this in the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Amen. The service continued with prayers and exhortations by the dean and archbishop. A newly composed choral anthem was sung by the choir. After the signing of the registers, William and Catherine walked down the aisle, pausing briefly to bow and curtsey to the Queen. They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families, being joined at the door by the two youngest bridesmaids. On leaving Westminster Abbey, to the pealing of bells, they passed through a guard of honour of individually selected men and women from the various services, and were greeted by cheers from the crowds. The bridal couple entered the 1902 State Landau drawn by four white horses with postilions and attendant footmen, and guarded by a mounted escort of the Life Guard. A similar open carriage carried the rest of the bridal party, escorted by the Blues and Royals. The Queen and other members of the Royal Family followed in coaches drawn by the Queen's Cleveland Bay horses, and in state cars. =Music= The couple return from the abbey to the Palace in the alt=Couple sitting in a decorated horse-drawn open-top carriage, with two footmen in livery sitting behind the newly-weds Two choirs, one orchestra and a fanfare ensemble played the music for the service. These were the Westminster Abbey Choir, the Chapel Royal Choir, the London Chamber Orchestra and a fanfare ensemble from the Central Band of the Royal Air Force. The choirs were directed by James O‚ÄôDonnell, organist and Master of the Choristers at Westminster Abbey. The abbey's sub-organist, Robert Quinney, played the organ. The organist, choir master and composer at the Chapel Royal is Andrew Gant. The London Chamber Orchestra was conducted by Christopher Warren-Green, who is its music director and principal conductor. The fanfares were performed under the direction of Wing Commander Duncan Stubbs. The bride processed down the aisle to the anthem \\"I was glad\\", written by Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry, from Psalm 122. It was composed for the crowning of Prince William's great-great-great grandfather, Edward VII, at Westminster Abbey in 1902.\\"Royal wedding: Crowds gather for the day\\", BBC News, 29 April 2011. Retrieved 29 April 2011. Three congregational hymns were sung during the service. The first was \\"Guide me, O Thou Great Redeemer\\" sung to the tune \\"Cwm Rhondda\\". The hymn, originally written in Welsh by 18th-century Methodist preacher William Williams, had been sung at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales.\\"Royal Wedding: Prince William and Kate Middleton choose popular hymns\\", The Telegraph, 29 April 2011; Accessed 29 April 2011. The words to their second hymn, \\"Love Divine, All Loves Excelling\\", were by Charles Wesley and its tune ‚Äì Blaenwern ‚Äì was composed by William Penfro Rowlands, during the 1904‚Äì1905 Welsh Revival. This hymn was sung at the Prince of Wales's 2005 marriage to the Duchess of Cornwall. The third hymn was \\"Jerusalem\\", based on the poem by William Blake and set to music by Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry. Choral compositions featured in the service were Parry's Blest Pair of Sirens (a setting of an ode by John Milton) during the signing of the register, Paul Mealor's Ubi Caritas et Amor as the motet and a specially commissioned anthem, \\"This is the day which the Lord hath made\\" consisting of words chosen from the Psalms, by John Rutter. Fanfare ensemble leader Wing Commander Duncan Stubbs's own composition, Valiant and Brave, was performed as the royal couple signed the wedding registers. Preux et audacieux (which translates from French as \\"Valiant and Brave\\") is the motto of 22 Squadron, in which Prince William was serving as a search and rescue pilot at RAF Valley in North Wales. The fanfare led into the recessional music, the orchestral march \\"Crown Imperial\\" by William Walton, composed for the coronation of George VI and which was also performed at Charles and Diana's wedding. The music performed before the service included two instrumental pieces by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies (\\"Veni Creator Spiritus\\" and \\"Farewell to Stromness\\") as well as with works by J.S. Bach, Benjamin Britten, Frederick Delius, Edward Elgar, Gerald Finzi, Charles Villiers Stanford, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Percy Whitlock. The bells of Westminster Abbey rang a full peal as the newly married couple and guests left the church. The ten bells rang a peal called \\"Spliced Surprise Royal\\", consisting of 5,040 changes, that took more than three hours to complete. They were rung by the volunteers of the Westminster Abbey Company of Ringers, under the direction of David Hilling.The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers ‚Äì Notes on ringing for the Royal Wedding and on the Abbey‚Äôs ringers and bells =Wedding ring= The wedding ring of Catherine is made from Welsh gold. The ring was created by the royal warrant holder Wartski, a company with roots in Bangor, Gwynedd, north Wales. Since 1923, it has been a tradition in the Royal Family to use Welsh gold for the wedding ring of the bride. This ring was made from a small amount of gold that had been kept in the royal vaults since it was presented to Queen It was mined from the Clogau Gold Mine in the mountains of North Wales. The Clogau Gold Mine had its heyday in the late nineteenth century, was abandoned in the early twentieth century, was reopened in 1992 and finally closed in 1998. The Queen had \\"given a piece of the gold that has been in the family for many years to Prince William as a gift,\\" a palace source stated. Prince William chose not to receive a wedding ring at the ceremony. =Title upon marriage= On the morning of the wedding, it was announced that William was to be created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn, and Baron Carrickfergus, with Catherine becoming Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge after the wedding. This is in line with the practice of granting titles upon marriage to royal princes who did not already have one (for example, Prince Andrew was created Duke of York when he married in 1986). Strathearn is close to St Andrews, Fife, in Scotland, where the couple met as students, and Carrickfergus is in Northern Ireland. Combined with his existing titular link with Wales, William's collective titles link him to each of the four countries in the United Kingdom. Family celebrations The newly married couple and the bridal party appearing on the balcony of Buckingham Palace; from left to right: Michael Middleton, Carole Middleton, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Charles, Eliza Lopes, Lady Louise Windsor, Grace van Cutsem, the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William, Margarita Armstrong-Jones, Tom Pettifer, William Lowther-Pinkerton, the Queen, Prince Philip, Pippa Middleton, Prince Harry The Queen hosted a lunchtime reception at Buckingham Palace, starting after the arrival of the married couple's carriage. It was a private gathering for guests drawn from the congregation who represent the couple's official and private lives. During the reception, at which the Official Harpist to the Prince of Wales, Claire Jones, performed, the couple made an appearance on the balcony on the east (main) front of Buckingham Palace, where they shared a kiss. Jones played a gold leaf harp known as \\"Prince of Wales\\" presented to Prince Charles in 2006 by Italian- American harp maker Salvi Harps. At 3.35 pm, William drove his new wife back up the Mall for the short distance to Clarence House, his then official London residence. The car, a blue, two seat Aston Martin DB6 Volante (MkII convertible) that had been given to Prince Charles by the Queen as a 21st birthday present, was decorated in the customary newlywed style by the best man and friends; the rear number plate read \\"JU5T WED\\". The Prince had changed into a Blues and Royals captain's frock coat also made by Kashket; his wife was still wearing her wedding dress. In a surprise organised by RAF Wattisham, the car was shadowed by a yellow Sea King helicopter flying the RAF Ensign from its winch cable, marking William's service as a pilot with the RAF Search and Rescue Force. In the evening, the Prince of Wales gave a private dinner, followed by dancing, at Buckingham Palace for the couple and their close friends and family. For the evening reception, the Duchess of Cambridge wore a strapless dress by Sarah Burton which \\"featured a circle skirt and diamante detailing\\". She also wore a white shrug and let her hair down. The singer- songwriter Ellie Goulding performed at the event, singing her rendition of \\"Your Song\\" for the couple's first dance. The singer also performed her hit single \\"Starry Eyed\\" for the assembled guests. The event ended at 3 am, with a small fireworks display in the palace grounds. The wedding cake had a strong British floral theme, using elements of the Joseph Lambeth technique. It was an eight-tiered traditional fruit cake decorated with sugar paste flowers. The cake designer Fiona Cairns based in Fleckney, Leicestershire was chosen in February 2011 to create the wedding cake. Additionally, McVitie's created a groom's cake from chocolate biscuit for the reception at Buckingham Palace. The chocolate biscuit cake was made from a Royal Family recipe and was specially requested by Prince William. The wedding bouquet was returned to Westminster Abbey and placed on the Tomb of The Unknown Warrior by a royal official, after the photographs had been taken. This followed the tradition started by Prince William's great grandmother, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, after her marriage to the Duke of York in 1923. The formal portraits were taken by Hugo Burnand at Buckingham Palace following the ceremony. Public celebration alt=Rear view of a three-aircraft flypast. In the middle is a four-engine bomber, which is flanked on both sides by propeller-driven fighters. =Official merchandise, coins, and stamps= Prince William and Catherine Middleton personally approved an official range of china (including handmade plates, cups, and pill boxes) to be made for the Royal Collection and sold as souvenirs from December 2010 on. The items are decorated with the intertwined initials of the couple under the prince's coronet and include the wording \\"To celebrate the marriage of Prince William of Wales and Catherine Middleton 29 April 2011.\\" The Lord Chamberlain's office approved a longer list of memorabilia, including official mugs, plates, biscuit tins, and porcelain pill pots. The document also clarified the use of William's coat of arms and pictures of the couple on such items. Initially, the Palace refused to sanction official tea towels, which, along with aprons, T-shirts and cushions, were deemed \\"in poor taste\\". However, the restriction on tea towels, though not the other items, was later reversed. Sales of merchandising were expected to reach ¬£44 million. To mark the engagement of William and Catherine, the Royal Mint produced an official Alderney ¬£5 engagement coin, showing the couple in profile, as well as an official UK¬£5 coin for the wedding. The Royal Australian Mint issued a series of circulation and collectable coins designed by Stuart Devlin. The Royal Canadian Mint released a series of coins and Canada Post issued a stamp, approved by Clarence House, in commemoration of the wedding. On 21 April, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail. =Broadcasting= Nick Dixon reporting on American views of the wedding in Times Square for ITV's Daybreak programme on 28 April 2011 The wedding was widely broadcast on television, internet, and radio, in more than 180 countries. ITV, BBC, and CNN covered the ceremony and associated events live through the combined pool of footage from the BBC, Sky, and ITN to help cover the overall cost. In North America, which is five to nine hours behind British Summer Time, the wedding occurred during the time usually taken up by network breakfast television programmes, which expanded their normal length to allow for full coverage. NBC's Today began coverage at 4 am Eastern Time, and along with MSNBC, partnered with ITV. ABC partnered with BBC, CBS has its own live London affiliates, and Fox and Fox News Channel partnered with their sister network Sky News. The CBC and CTV had live coverage. Cable networks and radio also had live coverage. In Mexico, the wedding aired on Televisa and TV Azteca; all television stations in Mexico carrying the ceremony stayed on the air during the late night hours instead of normally signing off. The ABC also took the BBC feed in Australia, in addition to pay TV channel UKTV. Coverage was also provided on the Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten. The ABC had planned to produce alternative commentary with The Chaser, but in response to these plans, the BBC barred the use of its footage for such a purpose, on orders from Clarence House. The royal wedding was also streamed live online on YouTube via the British Monarchy's official The Royal Channel. An April 2011 poll of 2,000 British adults found that 35% of the public intended to watch the wedding on television while an equal proportion planned to ignore the event altogether. According to their reported plans, women were more than twice as likely (47%) to watch the event as men (23%). Early estimates following the ceremony indicated an estimated 24.5 million people in the United Kingdom watched the wedding on either BBC One or ITV, giving those channels a 99.4% share of the terrestrial television audience as the service began, with the BBC's Live royal wedding website having 9 million hits, estimating over half the British population watched the wedding. The viewing figures for the event have been the subject of much speculation, with Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt estimating that 2 billion people would watch the wedding. Following the event, this figure was duly reported by the media, but was criticised by some news outlets for being inaccurate and unfounded. Estimated figures include a peak audience of 26.3 million viewers and a total of 36.7 million watching at least some part of the wedding coverage in the UK, while in the United States, the wedding drew an average audience of 22.8 million, with over 60 million tuning in at some point to watch some of the coverage. In India, a reported 42.1 million viewers tuned in, 9.9 million viewers in Germany, 9.6 million viewers in France, 5.22 million viewers watched the event in Canada with twelve million tuning in at some point, five million in Australia, and one million was expected in China, for an audience of 122 million to 176 million viewers, drawing from a total population pool of 3.126 billion (approximately 45% of the world's population). Other reported figures put the global audience at 162 million viewers. In addition to the television audiences, the ceremony attracted 72 million live streams and a reach of 101 million streams on YouTube across 188 countries. With its 72 million streams, the wedding has been listed in the 2012 Guinness Book of World Records for the record of \\"Most Live Streams for a Single Event\\", beating out the Michael Jackson memorial service in 2009. It has been suggested that the \\"two billion\\" figure is exaggerated, and that there are too many gaps in the worldwide TV measuring system to accurately audit global audience figures. = Power demand on the UK National Grid = In the UK, the National Grid reported a huge surge in demand for power after the service, equivalent to one million kettles being boiled, when the royal couple returned to Buckingham Palace. Viewership of the wedding was recorded by electricity use in Ontario, where, at the approximate moment Middleton arrived at Westminster Abbey, the Independent Electricity System Operator recorded a 300 megawatt drop in electricity use, which was attributed to \\"people going about their normal morning routines [stopping] whatever they were doing, rather than make breakfast or shower, and watch the TV\\". =Public response= The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight overhead crowds of well-wishers at The Mall hoping to see the newly married couple on the Buckingham Palace balcony There were about 5,500 applications to hold royal wedding street parties across England and Wales, including 850 in London, one of which was hosted by Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street for charity workers and local children. The anti-monarchy campaign group Republic held an alternative street party in Holborn. The event had initially been blocked by Camden Council after businesses raised concerns about loss of trade. A number of ceremonies and parties were held at places which had an intimate connection with the couple. In Scotland, about 2,000 people attended a party at the University of St Andrews, where the royal couple first met. Hundreds of people watched the ceremony on a big screen in Edinburgh's Festival Square. Welsh celebrations were led by Anglesey, where Prince William was a search and rescue pilot and where the couple resided after the wedding. 2,600 people gathered to watch the event on big screens there, and around 200 street parties were organised throughout the rest of the country, including over 50 in Cardiff. The international Peace Bridge across the Niagara River between the United States and Canada at Buffalo, New York, and Fort Erie, Ontario, and operated in part by an Ontario Crown corporation, was lit in red, blue and gold, the colours of the royal coat of arms. Criticism and scepticism stemmed from the belief that, at a time of recession and rising unemployment in the UK, millions of pounds in tax funds were used for the wedding's security. The costs of the wedding itself were paid for by the Royal Family and the Middletons.Werth, Christopher Royal wedding's expense questioned by British taxpayers American Public Media (22 April 2011).

At a peaceful protest in Soho Square, a man was arrested by plain clothes police. Chief Inspector John Dale claimed \\"He had articles on him to cause criminal damage\\". Police described the overall security operation as an \\"amazing success\\". 8 of the arrested appealed to the European Court of Human Rights that their arrests were unlawful, however their claims were rejected. In Scotland, twenty-one people were arrested at an unofficial \\"street party\\" in Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow which saw \\"completely unacceptable levels\\" of drunkenness, according to Strathclyde Police. A taxi driver died on 10 May from injuries sustained when his cab was struck by a police van attending the Kelvingrove incident. Honeymoon Despite reports that the couple would leave for their honeymoon the day after their wedding, Prince William immediately returned to his work as a search-and-rescue pilot, and the couple did not depart until 9 May, ten days after their wedding. The location of the honeymoon was initially kept secret. Although the press speculated that they might be headed to locations such as South America, Jordan, and Kenya, the couple ultimately decided to honeymoon for 10 days on a secluded villa on a private island in the Seychelles. On the morning of 21 May, a spokesman for St. James's Palace announced that the couple had returned to the United Kingdom. The length of the honeymoon was limited by William's RAF duties and the couple's official scheduled tour to Canada and the United States.

It was founded in 1875 by Jean N√∂tzli of Zurich as an \\"illustrated humorous political weekly.\\" The magazine was modelled on British magazine Punch. It continues to this day, though has been a monthly since late 1996. When Punch ceased publication in 2002, Nebelspalter became the oldest continually published humor magazine in the world. Becoming a national institution The Nebelspalter -- the title translates as \\"Fog-cleaver\\" -- had its heyday in the 1930s, before and during the Second World War, when it denounced the acts of violence and ideology of the Nazis and of their followers in Switzerland, the Frontists. In 1933 Nebelspalter was banned in Germany. Meanwhile, its circulation in Switzerland increased rapidly: in 1922 when the Rorschach publisher Ernst L√∂pfe-Benz took over the Nebelspalter its circulation was only 364 copies, partly as a consequence of its unpopular stance during the First World War. In 1945 the circulation was 30,000. The Nebelspalter had developed into a \\"spearhead of intellectual defense\\" against National Socialism, and it took a similar stand against communism in the Cold War until the 1960s. The popularity of the \\"Nebi\\", as it was called, was to a large extent due to the then editor-in- chief Carl B√∂ckli (born September 23, 1889, died 4 December 1970), who was talented both as an illustrator and writer in the tradition of Wilhelm Busch. Under his pen name \\"B√∂\\", he produced thousands of cartoons, drawings and texts until 1962. Circulation rose to 70,000 copies by the 1970s. For decades, the Nebelspalter was Switzerland's leading satirical medium and talent factory, associated with the biographies of such well known artists as Ren√© Gilsi, Jakob Nef, Fritz Behrendt, Nico Cadsky, and Horst Haitzinger, and of satirists such as C√©sar Keiser, Franz Hohler, Lorenz Keiser, Peter Root and Linard Bardill. The well-known Uri painter Heinrich Danioth was a draftsman and illustrator for the Nebelspalter for 15 years. The poet Albert Ehrismann was on the staff for more than three decades and published over 1,600 poems published there.  Crisis of the 1990s The Nebelspalter could not keep up with the rapid development of the Swiss media landscape in the last third of the 20th Century. Cartoons, columns and other satirical forms migrated more and more into the daily press and the audiovisual media. As it became more conventional the magazine steadily lost subscribers and readers. In the 1990s, the radical realignment of the Nebelspalter under editor-in-chief Ivan Raschle following the style of the Frankfurt Titanic magazine failed. The circulation plummeted from 34,000 copies to 17,000, and the shrinking number of advertisements further aggravated the crisis. The editor changed several times and in 1996 the magazine was sold to the Friedrich Reinhardt Verlag of Basel. The frequency of the magazine was changed from weekly to monthly in 1996. With a circulation of 8000, the suspension of publication was announced at the end of April 1998.  Signs of sustainable recovery  In 1998, the Thurgau publisher Thomas Engeli took over the ailing paper at the last minute. He managed to stop the loss of subscribers and readers and launch a new approach. Meanwhile, the magazine again had 200 regular text and image contributors. For its 130th anniversary in 2005, Nebelspalter ventured a gentle relaunch, apparently with some success. With a newly appointed editorial board under Marco Ratschiller the title underwent a face-lift leading toward an unpretentious journalistic style, and managed to win over well-known contemporary Swiss authors and satirists like Andreas Thiel, Simon Enzler, Pedro Lenz and Gion Mathias Cavelty. Early in 2010 Nebelspalter had a print run of 21,000 copies, and according to the market research study BasicMACH had 252,000 readers per issue. The Nebelspalter now appears ten times a year around the first Thursday of each month (except for double issues in January/February and August/September).

It is located on the Antonine Wall east of Bo'ness, and north-east of Linlithgow, in the former county of West Lothian. The earliest part of the house is an early 17th-century tower house, which was extended in the 17th and 19th centuries. Carriden House is protected as a category A listed building. Etymology of name Carriden is etymologically a Cumbric name. The first element is agreed to be *kair 'fortification'. The second element is more doubtful, but seems fairly likely to be the same regional name Eidyn that also appears in Edinburgh.Bethany Fox, 'The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland', The Heroic Age, 10 (2007), http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html (appendix at http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html).

This formed the eastern end of the Antonine Wall. It is the only Antonine Fort whose Latin name, Veluniate, is known. A centurion's stone was reported as built into the house, according to Sir George Macdonald who wrote about it. Finds from the fort include some window fragments. One suggested interpretation is that Carriden formed a chain of Lothian forts along with Cramond and Inveresk. A tower probably stood on this site in the 16th century, and this was rebuilt or replaced in 1602 by John Hamilton of Lettrick. The tower was purchased later in the 17th century by the Mylne family, a prominent dynasty of masons and architects, and a west wing was added by Alexander Mylne. During the 18th century the house had many owners, and landscaping works were carried out in the grounds. In 1814, the house was bought by Admiral Sir George Johnstone Hope (1767‚Äì1818), a veteran naval officer. His son Sir James Hope (1808‚Äì1881) made further alterations to the building, and also established the estate village of Muirhouses. The estate changed hands several more times, and by the 1970s was owned by the South of Scotland Electricity Board. Demolition was contemplated, to allow the building of a new power station on the site. This proposal was rejected and the house fell into disrepair. It the latter part of the 20th century the house was purchased from the SSEB by the Barkhouse family and restored as a private residence. The house has since undergone further renovation and modernisation, and continues to be a private family residence. Carriden House from the west  Description  The house is on an L-plan, and comprises the original tower house and the 17th-century wing. The tower house, dated 1602, is of three storeys and was remodelled in the 19th century. The two-storey wing added by Alexander Mylne is to the west, and bears a 1682 date stone. The study on the first floor has a 17th-century plaster ceiling described as \\"particularly exceptional\\". The porch in the angle of the L is also a 19th-century addition.

It inclues the housing estate of Slades Farm and lies within the ward district of Northbourne and Redhill. Initial development Ensbury Park takes its name from the Saxon hamlet of Ensbury, a separate area altogether which lay a mile or so to the north. This hamlet, just east of Kinson, has now been more or less subsumed into the postwar suburb of Northbourne but in the first half of the twentieth century, Ensbury Manor and Ensbury Farm constituted the borders of what later became the Ensbury Park district.S. J. Lands, Old Kinson (Bournemouth Local Studies Publications, 1972). In the 1920s Ensbury Park boasted a racecourse, which also served as an aerodrome. For several years it was known as ‚ÄúBournemouth Aerodrome‚Äù and was the venue for Air Race Meetings, though a series of fatal crashes at the Whitsun meet in 1927 led to its decline and eventual sale for housing development.Ensbury Park at hurnairport.co.uk; retrieved 10 April 2017 Much of the land associated with Ensbury Farm was sold off for housebuilding in the 1930s: the vending agents were A. J. Abbott & Sons, who coined the name 'Ensbury Park' for their new development.M. Stead, The Leybourne Estate (Bournemouth Local Studies Publications, 1989). The district was incorporated into the County Borough of Bournemouth in 1931, having theretofore been part of the Poole Rural District. The main road through the area at that time was Columbia Road which remains the principal route through the district, also nowadays connecting the Boundary Lane one-way system to Kinson Road. Facilities municipal and temporal Ensbury Park has three churches which serve the local residents: * St. Thomas' Parish Church * St. Bernadette's Catholic Church (this was the first church in the world to be dedicated to the French visionary saint) * Ensbury Park Methodist Church There are four schools in the area: * Winton Arts & Media College (formerly Winton Boys' School), Winton Way * Glenmoor School, Beswick Avenue (girls) * Kingsleigh Primary School, Hadow Road (mixed) * Hillview Primary School (mixed) There is a community centre in Ensbury Avenue that is part of a complex which also comprises an adult aducation/teachers‚Äô centre. There is also a small library in Columbia Road which is in fact the smallest in the borough. The area is covered by Redhill Fire Station in Redhill Avenue, approximately 100 yards from The Ensbury Park. Bournemouth Transport operate a bus service through the area which runs along the main Columbia Road. There is a new service operated by Wilts and Dorset, that is routed through Ensbury Park, to Poole. Landmarks and buildings The Ensbury Park public house (2008). One of the most conspicuous buildings in the district is The Ensbury Park public house which is on the corner of Columbia Road and Boundary Road. This started life as The Ensbury Park Hotel, planning permission for which was granted by Poole Rural District Council on 15 December 1924.Deposit no. 27034, Bournemouth Borough Council planning office. The building, with its neo-Georgian design elements, echoes 'Ensbury Manor' which included a genuine Georgian wing, and which dominated Ensbury Village for several centuries until being demolished in 1936. The pub closed suddenly in 2014, its lease having been surrendered to the freeholder, Enterprise Inns.https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/10874541.mystery-surrounds-future- of-bournemouths-ensbury-park-pub-after-closure/ In October 2015 the ground floor of building was taken over by the Co-Op and the rest became flats, although the iconic Ensbury Park Hotel sign remains on the building. Present day Ensbury Park had in the past a selection of shops, mainly along Columbia Road, though these have predominantly become private dwellings. A small selection of local convenience stores remains around the main junction of Columbia Road. This area remains a popular choice for home buyers due to its being a relatively quiet locale. There are recreational facilities nearby such as Redhill Park which has tennis courts, bowling green, outdoor paddling pool, cafe and a playground. Facilities for football, cricket, skateboarding etc., are also available at Slade's Farm Recreation Ground. On 10 September 2010 Bournemouth Borough Council announced that work would start on a new Olympic size community cycle track at Slade's Farm. The track opened as the Bournemouth Cycling Centre in June 2011, allowing the entire community to enjoy activities including competitive cycle training and racing, learning to ride a bike, cycling for exercise, in-line skating and running.

The station was opened by the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway (C&WJR;) in 1888 on its new \\"Northern Extension\\" from Calva Junction on the northern edge of Workington to the Maryport and Carlisle Railway's Derwent Branch at . The C&WJR; built this line to connect the C&WJR; with Carlisle and beyond. The line was double track from Workington to Seaton, then single to Linefoot Junction. Most stations on C&WJR; lines had heavy industrial neighbours, such as ironworks next to Cleator Moor West, or served primarily industrial workforces, such as Keekle Colliers' Platform. Seaton, however, was a fairly isolated country village. History The C&WJR; was built in the late 1870s, being one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, specifically being born as a reaction to oligopolistic behaviour by the London and North Western and Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railways. It was originally intended to drive the line northwards across country to meet the Caledonian Railway and cross into Scotland by the Solway Viaduct, but an accommodation was made with the LNWR leading to the intended northern extension being greatly watered down to three lines: * a link from to which opened in 1880 * a link from Cloffocks Junction to the CKPR line which opened in March 1885, and * the \\"Northern Extension\\" through Seaton to Linefoot Junction. All lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, none more so than the Northern Extension, which passed through open country. Passenger services were provided calling at Seaton, but they were so unsuccessful they petered out in 1922. The C&WJR; earned the local name \\"The Track of the Ironmasters\\". The founding Act of Parliament of June 1878 confirmed the company's agreement with the Furness Railway that the latter would operate the line for one third of the receipts. All C&WJR;'s lines were heavily graded. Almost all of the first three miles of the Northern Extension from Calva Junction through Seaton was rising at 1 in 70. This favoured loaded coal and coke trains. The Northern Extension became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at the Grouping of 1923. Like any business tied to one or few industries, the C&WJR; was particularly at the mercy of trade fluctuations and technological change. The Cumberland iron industry led the charge in the nineteenth century, but became less and less competitive as time passed and local ore became worked out and harder to win, taking the fortunes of the railway with it. The peak year was 1909, when the C&WJR; handled 1,644,514 tons of freight. Ominously for the line, that tonnage was down to just over 800,000 by 1922, bringing receipts of ¬£83,349, compared with passenger fares totalling ¬£6,570. The high water mark for tonnage on the C&WJR; was 1909, the high water mark for progress was 1913, with the opening of the Harrington and Lowca line for passenger traffic. A chronology of the line's affairs from 1876 to 1992 has almost no entries before 1914 which fail to include \\"opened\\" or \\"commenced\\". After 1918 the position was reversed, when the litany of step-by-step closures and withdrawals was relieved only by a control cabin and a signalbox being erected at Harrington Junction in 1919. Services C&WJR; passenger trains consisted of antiquated Furness stock hauled largely by elderly Furness engines referred to as \\"rolling ruins\\" by one author after a footplate ride in 1949. No Sunday passenger service was ever provided on any C&WJR; line. The Northern Extension had three stations: Seaton, and , the last being run jointly with the Maryport and Carlisle Railway (MCR). A passenger service was provided to Seaton over two periods: 1888 to 1897 and 1907 to 1922. The service in the first period appears to have been out and back over the to . This was reduced to Wednesdays and Saturdays only (Workington Market Days) from March 1891 and to Saturdays only from January 1894, being withdrawn completely in July 1897. The company tried again ten years later, with what appears to have been another daily out and back from Workington Central. From September 1908 this was extended, on Saturdays only, to Great Broughton and Linefoot Junction, making those outposts qualify as stations having had a publicly advertised passenger service. That experiment failed, as they disappeared from the timetable in December of that year, leaving Seaton as the only Northern extension station with a public passenger service. On 2 June 1913 a new public passenger service was opened from to Workington Central, aimed mainly but not exclusively at workers travelling to and from the remote Harrington No 10 Colliery and associated bi- products works on the clifftop at Lowca. One of these trains ran beyond Workington to Seaton and a second one did so on Saturday afternoons. Southbound (\\"Down\\") the early morning train started at Seaton and one other made an out and back trip from Seaton to Workington, rather than a through train. All others plied between Lowca and Workington Central only. This remained the case in 1919. The Lowca service continued to 1926, but the Seaton experiment ended altogether in February 1922. The W&CJR; ran many workmen's trains. Three collieries were served by the Northern Extension - Camerton, Buckhill and Alice Pit. No source lists any station, halt or workmen's service to this last, which was at the northern end of the line near Linefoot Junction. The 1920 Working Time Table lists Alice Pit, but shows no booked services of any description. and both had workmen's services at some point, but they are not mentioned in the May 1920 Working Time Table. Indeed, Camerton Colliery is not mentioned at all. The 1920 Working Time Table shows no Goods (as opposed to mineral) trains or \\"Through goods\\" trains booked to call or pass Seaton in either direction. Rundown and closure The West Cumberland iron and steel industry was heavily dependent on supplies of coke from the Northumberland and Durham coalfields. The Northern Extension allowed \\"a large proportion\\" of this traffic to be routed away from Maryport and the coastal line. Likewise the short chord between Workington Bridge and Cloffocks Junction allowed Durham coke traffic to reach the furnaces via then the C&WJR.; These must have suffered a significant decline, as by 1920 there were just two booked mineral workings each way each weekday between Linefoot Junction and Workington through Seaton. There was also a daily booked mineral train from Workington to Buckhill Colliery which passed through Seaton. It is therefore no surprise that the line north of Buckhill Colliery closed on 1 September 1921, leaving Seaton station \\"stranded\\" on what was effectively a long siding. Given this early decline it is remarkable that Seaton station remained open for goods traffic until 6 April 1962 and even more remarkable that the line through Seaton went on to outlive all other former C&WJR; metals by some years. Buckhill Colliery's output and Seaton station's slender goods traffic appear to be the sole reasons for keeping the remnant of the Northern Extension open after 1922, though Camerton Colliery appears to have still been in production until 1931.Camerton Colliery data, via Durham Mining Museum Buckhill Colliery closed in 1932, though even here it is questionable how much rail borne coal traffic it generated after 1924 when an aerial ropeway was installed taking its coals over the Derwent to William Pit at Great Clifton.Buckhill Colliery ropeway, via Durham Mining Museum The branch's longevity came about because the Admiralty, attracted by a remote area with rail and sea access, chose part of the site of Buckhill Colliery and the surrounding area to build a rail-served armaments depot which opened in 1938 and closed in 1992, taking the line with it. After the closure of the C&WJR; south of Workington Central in 1965 all trains through Seaton to the armaments depot travelled south from Siddick Junction past Calva Junction, where they reversed towards Seaton. Enthusiasts' specials An enthusiasts' special passed through Seaton on 5 September 1954, travelling to the then limit of public railway at Buckhill, the only one to traverse the C&WJR; using main line passenger stock. The next such train to traverse any C&WJR; metals was the \\"Solway Ranger\\" brakevan special on 7 May 1966, which repeated the run through Seaton to Buckhill, with a third and final such trip on 2 March 1968 Afterlife By 2015 the trackbed through Seaton was part of the West Cumbria Cycle Network.

The browser was based on the Tcl language and the Tk (toolkit) extension but did not achieve broad user-acceptance or market share, although it was included in many Linux distributions by default. Joseph Wang wanted tkWWW to become a replacement for r r n and to become a \\"swiss army knife\\" of networked computing. History Joseph Wang announced in July 1992 that he was developing a web browser based on Tk, and made the alpha version 0.1 publicly available. Version 0.4 integrated a much easier installation procedure, a better default color scheme, keyboard traversals and a history mechanism. Version 0.5, released 8 February 1993, introduced support for multiple fonts. Version 0.6 made personal annotations compatible with xmosaic and improved the GUI. With the release of version 0.7 on 1 May 1993, tkWWW became the first WYSIWYG HTML editor for X11 which was originally written by Nathan Torkington. Another improvement was the ability to start in iconic mode. Version 0.8 improved the graphical user interface (GUI) and added a \\"reload\\" option. In version 0.9, the browser achieved beta status and added support for character-styling tags and for version 7.0 of Tcl, as well as partial support for image tags. Version 0.11 worked successfully with RCS. Based on the newly released Tk 4.0, tkWWW 0.13 was an alpha release, in order to allow for wider testing. It also added full support for inline images. Support for HTML+, a proposed successor to HTML 2, was implemented while the specification was being developed. tkWWW was extended by the GNU Guile project, to support Scheme extensions. Further development The short-term agenda for tkWWW included an SGML parser and the separation of the browser from the editor, in order to simplify user experience. The long-term plan included new functions like word processing, directory navigation, file transfer, and news and email reading. Features * With the htext-widget, Tk code could be embedded into web pages. * Because the interface was written in Tk, it was easy to modify and extend the system. * A WYSIWYG editor for HTML web pages, with all major HTML functions (character emphasis, headings, paragraph breaks, lists, anchors) * Support for many protocols: FTP, gopher, HTTP, telnet * Multiple fonts, including support for Asian fonts * Multimedia formats supported: bitmap, DVI, GIF MPEG, PostScript, and X Window dump files * Automatic file unpacking tkWWW was developed before the advent of Safe-Tcl, to allow untrusted applications to run from non-privileged accounts. Without such a safeguard, the potential for automatically executing remote scripts was a security issue. tkWWW was criticized for not supporting the mailto URI scheme, rlogin, WAIS, and HTML forms. A stop-button to interrupt the transfer of web pages was also not integrated.Ian S. Graham, The HTML Sourcebook: The Complete Guide to HTML, p. 327. Extensions A diagram how tkWWW and TkWWW Robot working together. Because tkWWW was based on the Tk framework, it was very easy to expand its functions and to extend its capabilities. Indeed, there were several extensions and applications based on tkWWW. =Phoenix= Phoenix was a well-known web browser and editor, created at the University of Chicago in the Biological Sciences Division, that was built on tkWWW version 0.9. Development began in the summer of 1993, when there weren't any easy-to- use web-page editors available.README of Phoenix-0.1.8 Alpha release (released 15 May 1995); available here Development ceased in May 1995, there being a variety of similar tools available. The main new features were: improved HTML+ support, deeper integration of features such as copy and paste and native look-and-feel, and support for the Kerberos protocol by modified servers. The browser was supported on MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, and on Linux and other Unix systems. Further development would have added support for BSD platforms. The short-term plan for tkWWW was to separate the editing and browsing functions, as had already been accomplished for Phoenix. Inline- image support for GIFs and ISMAPs were also already integrated in the first version of Phoenix. The ability to access Multi-user Object-Oriented (MOO) or Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) servers was requested as a new package for tkWWW, and this was delivered by the Phoenix team. =The TkWWW Robot= A screenshot of the TkWWW Robot Browsing Interface. Scott Spetka presented a paper at the Mosaic and the Web Conference in Chicago entitled \\"The TkWWW Robot\\" in October 1994. TkWWW robot was one of the first web crawlers and internet bots based on tkWWW. It was developed over the summer at the Air Force Rome Laboratory, with funding from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, to build HTML indexes, compile WWW statistics, collect image portfolios, etc. TkWWW robot's major advantage was its flexibility in adapting to virtually any criteria to guide its search path and to control its selection of data for retrieval. The search algorithm worked by identifying \\"web neighborhoods\\" ‚Äî finding logically related homepages. The bot returned a list of links in the form of bookmarks. It was limited, however, in that it could include only two links from the original homepages. System requirements and technical tkWWW was originally developed for Unix but would run on any modern operating system where Tcl/Tk is properly installed.README-file of the tkWWW-0.13pre2 package. To display images, tkWWW requires the xli package. tkWWW has two strictly separated processes: one for the GUI, and another for network interaction and for parsing HTML. The latter is compiled C code based on the CERN libwww library. The front-end GUI is written in Tcl/Tk, which is interpreted at run time.

Hamilton was given instructions to design the town layout in 1894, which was to be named IOU. Hamilton suggested the name be changed to the Indigenous Australian name of a nearby spring called Bulong. The townsite was gazetted in 1895. On the back of gold mining the population of the town grew to 620 by 1900, and it boasted large number of businesses including several hotels, bakeries, accountants, butchers and stores. The town also had a hospital, school, police station, telegraph station and post office. The town's water supply was obtained from Lake Yindarlagooda, condensed on the lake's banks then pumped to the top of Mount Stuart to gravity feed to the town. It had its own newspaper, the Bulong Bulletin, from 1897 to 1898. Hotels included the Bulong Hotel (on the corner of Reid and Colin Streets), the Court Hotel, Globe Hotel and Grand Hotel.

History Even before Swami Vivekananda started the Belur Math, he wanted to establish a Math for women with the Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi as its centre. However, it was during the Holy Mother‚Äôs birth centenary in 1954, that Sri Sarada Math came into existence. In 1960, the Trustees of Sri Sarada Math founded the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Association with the object of propagating educational, cultural, charitable, medical and similar activities among women and children. Through the headquarters at Dakshineswar, Calcutta, and its branch centres around India, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission seeks to serve women and children in all possible ways, irrespective of caste, creed, colour and nationality. At present the Math and the Mission run about 25 centres in India and abroad. Vivekananda Vidyabhavan, a partly residential degree college for women was the first educational institution started by the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. It came into existence in 1961 as a humble effort to carry out Swami Vivekananda‚Äôs ideals of education among women. The inaugural meeting to set up the college took place at 33 Nayapatty Road, Kolkata-55, on 10 March 1961. The meeting was presided by most revered Swami Mahadevananda, the then-General Secretary of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission. Housed initially in a one-roomed makeshift structure, with 31 students and a handful of young, idealistic and enthusiastic teachers and monastic members, the college today stands among the premier women‚Äôs institutions of the state.

Library Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vivekananda Vidyabhavan Library now known as \\"Sraddhaprana Pathakakshma\\" was set up in 1961, when the college was established. Earlier the library was housed at the college building adjacent to the Teachers‚Äô Common Room. In 1975 it was shifted to the first floor of the Assembly hall (Muktiprana Sabhagriha).

Medallion Funding earned returns on investment over 20 percent per year. The price of NY City medallions peaked in 2013, as the emergence of ride-hailing companies caused the first significant and sustained decline in medallion values. In order to navigate this challenge, Murstein reduced medallion lending, expanded consumer lending and restructured existing medallion loans. To better communicate the more diversified lending strategy, a stock symbol change was made from \\"TAXI\\" to \\"MFIN\\" on May 10, 2016 A decision was also made to eliminate the dividend and convert to a C corp from a Business Development Company due to tax and capital considerations. After a steep decline, shares of MFIN began to rebound in the second half of 2017, and Murstein declared \\"I think the prices for medallions has bottomed out\\" in October 2017. As recently as December 12, 2017, 9% senior notes issued by Medallion Financial traded for over 100% of par value, which is a significant recovery from distressed levels reached earlier in 2017, and an indication of improved investor confidence. Medallion Financials stock price (NASDAQ: MFIN) has tripled in the last year. On May 19, 2019, New York Times published an investigative report on how medallion lending practices effected a generation of taxi drivers, citing Murstein, among others, as moving the industry toward riskier lending practices.

In 1994, Murstein invested $1 million to create a subsidiary which sold advertising on the tops of taxis. The subsidiary, eventually named Medallion Taxi Media, was enhanced in 1996 with the acquisition of See Level Advertising.

He is considered a pioneer in experimental art, rejecting traditional romanticism and confronting social and critical issues through a range of distinctive styles and media. Life Aung Myint was born on 27 October 1946, and attended the Rangoon Arts and Science University, graduating in 1968 with a major in Psychology. A self-taught painter, Aung Myint began to exhibit his work in the 1960s. He became a leading figure in Yangon's contemporary art scene. Aung Myint co-founded The Inya Gallery of Art. In 1995, he made his first stage performance with the work Beginning n End. Aung Myint had his first solo exhibition in his Inya Gallery of Art in 1994, and since then has held many more in Yangon. He has also had solo exhibitions in Tokyo, Germany, Singapore and New York City. He co-authored the book Myanmar Contemporary Art 1 with Aung Min. Work Aung Myint's paintings, installation art and performance art have a broad range of unique styles. Although he is interested in the work of artists such as Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock, he refuses to categorize his work in terms of \\"isms\\". His work includes both representational and abstract images. In the mid-1960s his work was semi- abstract, with cubist elements. This evolved through a period in the 1970s and 1980s when he \\"fragmented\\" his images, and then into a highly emotional style in the 1990s with splashing, smearing and dripping of paint in strokes, which strongly evoked the works of Jackson Pollock's \\"action paintings\\" but also derived its inspiration from the circle and swirls of the Myanmar alphabet. Other painters of the American New York School of the post-war period, such as de Kooning, have influenced his work where in harrowing portraits the features of faces are tortured and twisted. But Aung Myint also reaches back into Burmese painting history for inspiration. In an unusual and provocative piece done in 2001 entitled Five Continents, he filled the bottom of the painting with images of Edvard Munch's \\"scream faces\\", in rows, as effigies of the Buddha might appear on the walls of Bagan temples. The upper portion of the painting was divided into five panels dripping in violent red paint.\\" His more recent monochromatic drawings of mother and child are well known in Southeast Asia. According to Steven Pettifor, \\"the works are skillfully made using a single flowing line that conveys the artist's emotions and mood. These drawings are rooted in feelings of loss and abandonment from the death of his mother when the artist was an infant. The works also evoke the fluid line and form of works by such modernist masters as Henry Moore and Pablo Picasso\\". The \\"flowing line\\" in such works derives from one-line painting, a term which in Burma refers to a technique used in the mural works of Bagan and on into the Traditional painting of the early 20th century. In one-line painting an image is not painted in short strokes or dabs as is often the case in Western painting, but in a single flowing line from beginning to end. The \\"Mother and Child\\" series won the \\"Jurors' Choice Award\\" at the ASEAN Art Award in Bail. Aung Myint's work is held in the Singapore Art Museum, Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, National Art Gallery (Malaysia) and in private collections in Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Germany, Netherlands, Hungary, Australia and the United States.

Further development was shaped by Josef Chuchro and Daniel Veis. An opportunity to study under Spanish virtuoso Luis Claret in Barcelona proved a milestone on the path to gathering experience and knowledge. Jan ≈†krdl√≠k's musical career is characterised by his openness to new trends and a constant quest for valid options in musical interpretation. Jan ≈†krdl√≠k started to take part in competitions in the late 1980s, both as a solo musician and as part of ensembles, and won his first awards. His greatest success was the Silver Medal and the Special Prize for the best rendering of a Beethoven composition at the prestigious International Beethoven Contest in Hradec. Consistently high standards led to being awarded a year's scholarship visit to Spain in the late 1980s. During his studies in Barcelona, he helped establish the first professional ensemble in Murcia, southern Spain. In 1991, the Czechoslovak Music Foundation awarded him their prize for the promotion of Czech music abroad. Since then, Jan ≈†krdl√≠k has performed in Europe and beyond, both solo and as part of music ensembles.  Concerts and recordings  The number of concerts that Jan ≈†krdl√≠k has given over the past twenty years runs easily into four figures. His first public performance took place in spring 1990, shortly after returning from Murcia, in Spain (1988‚Äì89), where he had been studying and where he had also helped start a professional ensemble, the first of its kind there. He then toured Czechoslovakia with piano player Pedro Valer Abril, with whom he also recorded Prokofiev's Piano Sonata No. 9 in C major, Op. 103, in the Olomouc studio of Czech Broadcasting [ƒåesk√Ω rozhlas]. Some months later he joined the Wallinger Quartet, a highly respected chamber music ensemble, a position that brought with it many opportunities to perform in the Czech Republic and beyond in the early 1990s. The Wallinger Quartet played concerts all over central, western and south-western Europe and performed regularly in the USA. The Wallinger Quartet concerts apart, Jan ≈†krdl√≠k also performed in violoncello recitals and later became a soloist with various orchestras. The recitals included concerts with the piano played by Renata Arda≈°evov√°, among other leading pianists, and concerts with the cembalo played by Barbara Maria Willi. Jan ≈†krdl√≠k also collaborated with other chamber music ensembles and helped establish, among others, Ardor musicus, the Czech Baroque Trio, the Gideon Trio and Ensemble Messiaen. In 2004 he help establish the ensemble known as the Brno Chamber Soloists ensemble, which specialises in 19th- and 20th-century music. A year later he toured the US with them as soloist; in the course of six weeks he performed on 35 stages and critics in Miami lauded his performance as ‚Äúa sensation‚Äù.(El Nuevo Herald, Miami, 5. 10. 2005, reviewer Daniel Fernandez commented: ...Por su parte, Jan Skrdlik, en el cello, fue una verdadera revelaci√≥n en el bell√≠simo Concierto para cello en do menor, de Johann Christian Bach...) ≈†krdl√≠k has recorded for several labels. His CD performance of Bach's Suites was noted outside the Czech Republic. He recorded in the studios of Czech Broadcasting regularly in the 1990s. A list of Jan ≈†krdl√≠k concerts covering the period January 1994 - June 2009 may be found in Povol√°n√≠m ‚Äì ƒçlovƒõk, biografie violoncellisty Jana ≈†krdl√≠ka [‚ÄúVocation: ‚Äì Ordinary Man: A Biography of Jan ≈†krdl√≠k‚Äù], written by Radoslav Kvƒõch.  Films and multimedia concerts  In 2007, the theft of Jan ≈†krdl√≠k's violoncello inspired what was possibly the first instrumental classical music video in history.Ta≈•√°na Kuxov√°, Metropolitan magazine, year 3, July-August 2008, p. 19 The instrument, a precious product of the craft of Adam Emanuel Homolka in 1842, was stolen from his studio; news of the crime merited a spot on TV news and the violoncello was returned. A year later, this led to the innovative Claude Debussy ‚Äì Sonate pour violoncelle et piano, set as a short film narrative, with mime, an imaginative performance based on events around the ‚Äúcrime‚Äù. A Czech-Slovak team, including Czech film director Milan R≈Ø≈æiƒçka, created the film, which ≈†krdl√≠k later used as part of multimedia concerts; it was employed as back-projection for live performances. Several films made for similar purposes followed.  Social involvement and scholarship  Jan ≈†krdl√≠k's social involvement and scholarly activities have had indirect influences on the direction and nature of his music. They fall into three categories. *Charity and welfare  He is an engaged and active participant in charity and welfare activities. These include, for example, religiously based performances in the B≈ôeclav prison, in collaboration with Father Jan Majer, and heading a club for Roma children under the aegis of the Brno Evangelist church in 2000-2009 that included a religious programme and music in its agenda. He has helped set up and organise musical events such as the Effatha festival and the Music not just for the Angels concert cycle, still in progress. *Academic development and language  An interest in languages led him to enrol at Masaryk University, Brno to study linguistics and the Romance languages, with special reference to Spanish language and literature in 2008.Masarykova univerzita Brno, official website Seeking to exercise his talent and expand general language knowledge, he accepted a part-time job as teacher of Spanish at the Moravsk√© gymn√°zium, Brno in late 2007.Moravsk√© gymn√°zium Brno, official website *Academic development and the science of acoustics  Jan ≈†krdl√≠k conducts research into string tuning and the subjective influences of frequencies and harmonics. Working with other experts, such as musicologist Ludƒõk Zenkl and cembalist Barbara Maria Willi, he addresses the tuning of historical instruments and its relationship to harmonic sets. His Vyu≈æit√≠ intonaƒçn√≠ch p√°sem ve h≈ôe na smyƒçcov√© n√°stroje [‚ÄúUsage of Tuning Bands in String Instruments‚Äù] sums up the results, which he applies further in several ways: * In pedagogical matters, his attention is upon the relationship between his results and psychology. * In concert, he employs a phenomenon known as ‚Äúdifferential oscillations‚Äù, which he calls ‚Äúnatural vibrato‚Äù. This can colour every note interpreted to a greater or lesser extent, and may be taken further to shape any given music phrase. * The results of his research are primarily employed in the construction of violoncellos and other stringed instruments. They find particular application in the use of the fifth eurhythmic string led below fingerboard, tuned in such fashion that its vibrations favourably influence the production of a tone. Teaching In 1997-2009 Jan ≈†krdl√≠k taught violoncello and chamber music performance at the Brno Conservatory. Some of his students went on to work with him on the organisation of a variety of musical projects, or became players in ensembles that he led. Further pedagogical activities include teaching violoncello interpretation courses in Murcia, Spain in 2003 and international courses in baroque music in Kelƒç in 2009 and elsewhere. His teaching aims to support the natural musical development of the student with respect to the development of her/his personality; it is far less concerned with criticism of performance. After twenty years on the Czech music scene Jan ≈†krdl√≠k has come to realise that Czech society lacks a wider base of enthusiastic amateur musicians that might promote interest in classical music. Since 2004 he has helped organise interpretation courses in Opoƒçno, and led them, providing a milieu in which amateur musician can play alongside conservatory students and university-trained musicians. Writing Jan ≈†krdl√≠k has written a book of poetry, Tv√° slova [‚ÄúThy Words‚Äù], and several sociologically oriented popular articles, published in Kam√≠nky journal of the Family and Social Care Centre, Brno. He has also written other pieces in Czech and Spanish.

Adult shell size ranges from 2 or 3 cm to giants reaching 50 cm in such genera as Apoderoceras, Epideroceras, and Liparoceras.Donovan,D.T., Callomon and Howarth 1981. Classification of the Jurassic Ammonitina; Systematics Association. Arkell et al., 1957. Mesozoic Ammonoidea, in Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, (Part L); Geological Soc. of America and University of Kansas press The earliest known eodoceroceratoidean is the eoderoceratid genus Microderoceras. Although its origin is uncertain, it is likely that it is derived from the Psiloceratoidea. It has also been proposed, with some imagination, that Microderoceas has its origin some earlier Jurassic lytoceratid such as Analytoceras. Seven families are included, beginning with the Eoceroceratidae, which gave rise at about the same time to the Phricodoceratidae, Coeloceratidae, Liparoceratidae, and Polyhmorphitidae. The Phricodoceratidae left no descendants but the Coeloceratidae later gave rise to the Dactylioceratidae and the Liparoceratidae to the Amaltheidae. The Polymorphitidae became the source for the superfamilies Hildocerataceae beginning with the Hildoceratidae. The more recent taxonomy of Donovan et al. (1981) with seven families, differs from that of Arkell, et al. in the Treatise (1957) which included just five families. The phricodoceratids and coeoloceratids were then considered as subfamilies (Phricodoceratinae and Coeloceratinae, respectively) of the Eoderoceratidae. As later (1981) the Liparoceratidae and Polyhmorphitidae were derived from the Eoderoceratidae but the Dactylioceratidae were derived separately (1957) from the Lytoceratidae - a source since then largely rejected.

(1) Teaching The focus of his teaching is to learn Buddha's enlightened mind through the practice of the koan, a story or question that cannot be understood by logical thinking but only through intuitive thinking. The focus is on attaining the true nature of all beings directly through intuitive thinking. This mind-to-mind teaching is the core teaching of the Korean Buddhist Chogye Order and is now being spread throughout the world by lineage masters such as Pohwa Sunim. ‚ÄúIf you want to know the answer, you must see your ‚Äòoriginal mind‚Äô which is the ‚Äòoriginal mind‚Äô of all sages and all beings.‚Äù (2)(3) Some of his more frequently employed phrases include, ‚ÄúDogs chase mudballs.

It is defined as ‚Äúa hypothesis that describes how a simple numerical imbalance in representation along nominal social category lines can affect people‚Äôs choice of candidates in highly competitive situations (e.g., awards, jobs, etc.)‚Äù.Garcia & Ybarra, 2007, p.802. Definition The people accounting hypothesis can be derived from connecting social categorization, fairness, and choice literatures. When a numerical imbalance between social categories is recognized by individuals, the ‚Äúsocial categorization and fairness literature clearly suggests that the concern for fairness shifts from the interpersonal to the intergroup level, prompting individuals to correct an imbalance by promoting equality between groups‚Äù.Garcia & Ybarra, 2007, p.803. Another characteristic of the people accounting hypothesis is that while it can be caused by many different nominal social category lines, in the end it is ‚Äúmore likely to be triggered on a meaningful social category dimension versus a less meaningful one‚Äù. It should also be stressed that the significance of a social category line is ‚Äúcontext specific‚Äù.Garcia et al., 2009, p.258. Furthermore, there are implications of the people accounting hypothesis toward the affirmative action policy discussion. Observers note that ‚Äúpeople accounting explains a much broader aversion to imbalance across social category lines‚Äù than affirmative action programs that try to promote diversity and overcome past inequalitiesGarcia et al., 2009, p.259. By examining the people accounting hypothesis, they want to address a far broader phenomenon than the ‚Äúnarrow policy of affirmative action‚ÄùGarcia & Ybarra, 2007, p.802. and examine its tendency towards equality that goes beyond race and gender.Garcia et al., 2009, p.260. Further, the people accounting hypothesis only works under two conditions: It requires an objective perspective of third parties and the acknowledgment of an imbalance along gender lines. If third parties do not recognize a numerical imbalance between social categories ‚Äì be it on purpose or not ‚Äì or ‚Äúare partial to one category in the dispute, people accounting will not take place‚Äù,Garcia et al., 2009, p.260. whilst cautioning that ‚Äúthere are undoubtedly individual differences in what people perceive as an imbalance‚Äù.Garcia et al., 2009, p.259. Also, the assumption of an impartial, objective assessment of third- party observers should be questioned. It is difficult to find third-party observers with a totally impartial perspective. Since every person acts in a certain context and has his own background and interconnections with other people, there is no such thing as an impartial third-party observer. Empirical analyses Garcia and Ybarra conducted a series of empirical studies where they tested the people accounting hypothesis. Based on these findings, the focus of their analysis was that if there is an alleged imbalance along social category lines, then not everybody will have equal opportunities in the workplace.Garcia et al., 2009, p.258. Garcia and his colleagues conclude that ‚Äúto the extent that a social category is overrepresented, the winning chances for a member from an over-represented category will drop at the discretion of impartial third parties‚Äù. This process is explained by the fact that impartial third-party observers are reluctant to create inequalities along social category lines, and therefore feel pressure to categorically deny the overrepresented social category equal opportunity.Garcia et al., 2009, p.257. Garcia et al. also critically observe that ‚Äúpeople accounting does not always result in the final selection of members of underrepresented social category groups‚Äù. There are many other possible reasons why not everyone will have the same opportunity in the workplace (e.g., ingroup favoritism). Garcia and his colleagues focus on the perspective of impartial third-party observers and the psychological aspects of social categorization.Garcia et al., 2009, p.258.

O'Brien was ranked number 14 in Total Politics‚Äô poll of the top 50 political influencers in Britain, named in The Daily Telegraph as one of the \\"Top 100 Most Influential people on the Right\\", in the Sunday Times as one of the \\"New Political Elite\\" and as one of the Evening Standard's \\"Power 1000 of London‚Äôs New Influentials\\". He was elected MP for Harborough in 2017 with a majority of 12,429. In 2018 he founded the new think tank Onward together with Will Tanner and Nick Faith. It is chaired by Daniel Finkelstein, the Conservative Peer and columnist for The Times. Between August 2018 and July 2019 he was Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to ministers at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. In August 2019 he was appointed PPS to Justice Minister Robert Buckland. Publications In June 2018 O‚ÄôBrien published a report on reforming housing and planning policy, ‚ÄúGreen, Pleasant and Affordable.‚Äù. The report argued that reforms to planning law are needed to change where new homes are built, avoid piecemeal development, and ensure that developers pay more towards the costs of the infrastructure that is needed to support new development. It also proposed a new form of affordable rented housing for young people in work. In January 2019 together with Will Tanner and Guy Miscampbell he published a report on reform of higher education, ‚ÄúA Question Of Degree‚Äù. It proposed that graduate repayments should be halved, with the cost of this funded by reducing the number of students on what the report called ‚Äúlow value‚Äù courses - courses from which graduates do not earn enough of a premium to repay the cost of their study. The BBC reported that ‚ÄúThe Onward report urges the government to halve repayments on students loans, by introducing a tax cut for graduates worth 50p in every pound owed‚Äù and quoted Mr O‚ÄôBrien saying ‚ÄúWe should steer people away from courses that don't lead to good outcomes.‚Äù. In May 2019 O‚ÄôBrien published ‚ÄúFiring On All Cylinders‚Äù, a wide-ranging report on economic policy which argued for a new fiscal rule, and a somewhat looser fiscal policy, to enable more investment in public services, particularly in schools and the criminal justice system. The report argued for tax reductions and radically more generous capital allowances to boost investment and tackle Britain's productivity problem. It argued for ‚Äúbottom up growth‚Äù and more generous work allowances in Universal Credit to boost the incomes of low earners and increase employment. The report was praised by several of the contenders in the Conservative Party leadership race which was underway at the time the report was published. ‚ÄúSmall schools and village schools‚Äù were the subject of a research note published by O‚ÄôBrien in July 2019. O‚ÄôBrien also led a debate in Westminster Hall on the same issue in that month. In Parliament Mr O‚ÄôBrien stated that, ‚ÄúIn 1980 there were 11,464 small primary schools with fewer than 200 pupils, but in 2018 there were just 5,406.‚Äù He called for increases to the ‚Äúlump sum‚Äù element within the National Funding Formula for Schools in order to support smaller schools, particularly those in rural areas. Also in July 2019 he published a research note on prolific criminals, drawing on answers obtained from a series of Parliamentary Questions. The research note, ‚ÄúSuper Prolific Criminals, The Case For Action‚Äù, highlighted that roughly half of all crime in England and Wales is committed by just 10% of offenders. It called for a review of sentencing policy to increase prison sentences and imprisonment rates among offenders with many previous convictions who re-offend. In March 2010, O'Brien co-authored with Ross Clark a wide-ranging book called The Renewal of Government. It was praised by Michael Gove, then Shadow Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, and later Secretary of State for Education, who said that it \\"lays down with admirable clarity and form a set of radical policies ... which in the field of education I think are peerless\\".

History The church was built as part of the Benedictine Priory of St Mary. The townspeople came to an arrangement with the priory for the complete rebuilding in the 15th century, and the church was rebuilt in sections with the nave being done first between 1432-44, the chancel between 1445-48, the tower between 1449-59 and the screen from 1459-60. The mason Roger Crowden is noted as having designed the tower, and given the similarity in style for the rest of the church, he may be responsible for the whole works. The church is noted for the monument to Walter Smith who died in 1555. It is erected in the south chancel aisle and comprises a tomb-chest in an ogee recess with quatrefoil decoration. The candelabra in brass was installed in 1701. In 1824 the outer north aisle was added. This north aisle was modified in 1869 by Sir Gilbert Scott who added additional seating which allowed for the removal of the western galleries and the galleries in the rood loft. Vicars Organ The organ The church is likely to have contained an organ before the reformation. The first post- Reformation organ was installed in 1720 and survived until 1817. A new organ by Flight and Robson was then installed. The basis of the current instrument is a pipe organ which was built by Father Henry Willis for the Great Exhibition in 1851 and installed and opened by him in Totnes on Sunday 11 August 1861. It has since had subsequent restorations and modifications and now comprises 3 manuals and pedals with 33 speaking stops. A specification of the organ can be found in the National Pipe Organ Register. =Organists= *William Reeve 1781 - 1783 *William Coombe 1802 - 1811 (formerly organist at Chard, Somerset, afterwards organist of Chelmsford) *Henry Compton ca. 1818 - 1858 *John Horth Deane 1859 - 1864 (formerly organist of St John's Church, Torquay and Beccles Church, Suffolk) *Herr Eberlein 1864 - 1867 (formerly organist of St Peter's Church, Tiverton, afterwards organist of St Leonard‚Äôs Church, Exeter) *Richard Sparke Distin ca. 1870 *Herbert Worth 1878 - 1929 *Anthony B.

The partnership was first announced on November 16, 2010; following a trial period in 2012, the service officially launched nationwide on November 14, 2013. The official Softcard app was available for NFC-compatible smartphones using the Android operating system and later on Windows Phone 8.1. On February 23, 2015, it was announced that Google‚Äîwhich had developed a competing system known as Google Wallet, backed by Sprint and MetroPCS‚Äîhad acquired certain assets and intellectual property from Softcard. The Softcard service was discontinued on March 31, 2015, and the three founding carriers pledged support for Google Wallet. In May 2015, Google unveiled Android Pay as a successor to Google Wallet and Softcard.  History  In November 2010, AT&T;, T-Mobile, and Verizon officially announced a joint venture known as Isis, which planned to develop a near-field communications-based mobile payments platform. The venture also announced partnerships with Discover Financial for access to its point-of-service network, and Barclaycard as a card issuer. The company stated that it planned to \\"introduce its service in key geographic markets during the next 18 months\\". The three carriers announced plans to invest more than $100 million in the project. The service originally planned to operate as a payment system that would handle its own transactions, but citing rapidly developing competition, Isis changed its model to integrate with existing credit cards and payment networks. On July 19, 2011, Isis announced that American Express, MasterCard, and Visa would additionally back the platform. Isis planned to launch a trial program in Salt Lake City and Austin in early to mid 2012. In September 2011, Isis announced that HTC, LG Electronics, Motorola Mobility, Samsung Electronics, Research in Motion, and Sony Ericsson had committed to manufacturing smartphones that would be compatible with the system. It also announced a partnership with DeviceFidelity to manufacture NFC-enabling accessories for other devices so that they could support Isis. In February 2012, Isis announced Barclaycard, Capital One, and Chase as launch bank partners for the service. Isis soft-launched in Austin and Salt Lake City on October 22, 2012, and launched nationwide on November 14, 2013. In September 2014, the service was renamed \\"Softcard\\", as the name \\"Isis\\" had gained negative connotations due to its association with the terrorist organization Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, IS), which had previously referred to itself as the \\"Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham\\"‚Äîa name commonly abbreviated as \\"ISIS\\". = Google acquisition, discontinuation = On February 23, 2015, Google announced that it would acquire certain assets and intellectual property from Softcard, and integrate it into its own service, Google Wallet. At the same time, it was announced that AT&T;, T-Mobile US, and Verizon would begin to back Google Wallet, and bundle its app with their compatible devices later in the year, in place of Softcard. The partnership aimed to build a stronger competitor to the competing mobile payment platform Apple Pay, which was introduced alongside the launch of the iPhone 6 in late 2014, and experienced heavier adoption than other competing services due to Apple's position in the market. Softcard CEO Michael Abbott had previously indicated that the company was \\"actively working\\" with Apple to integrate its service with the device. Google Wallet was also backed by Sprint and MetroPCS. All three carriers had previously worked together in a standard setting environment without including Google Wallet; Verizon refused to allow its devices to access the service because it requires access to the \\"secure element\\" of a smartphone, despite Softcard having the same requirement. The Softcard service and apps ceased to function on March 31, 2015. Softcard customer data was not migrated to Google Wallet, and the service does not support Windows Phone. At Google's I/O developers' conference that May, the company unveiled a replacement for both services known as Android Pay.

It is affiliated with the International Paralympic Committee(IPC). The World Organization Volleyball for Disabled was established in 1981 and was part of the International Sports Organization for Disabled (ISOD). In 1992 the WOVD became its own separate Organization in Barcelona, Spain. The WOVD Headquarters were also established in the Netherlands. The WOVD is responsible for managing and controlling the conduct of international volleyball competitions for men, women and youth. The WOVD also liaises with IPC (as an independent organisation) and with other organizations for people with or without disabilities. The organization adopted its present name World ParaVolley at its 2014 general assembly. History As volleyball caught on and became a popular sport and the Olympics became increasingly popular, the paralympic games started coming into play. The first paralympic games were played in 1960 in Rome immediately after the Olympic Games. By 1976, amputees started participating in the paralympics. In 1967 the Dutch introduced a new game called sitting volleyball, which is a combination of sitzball and volleyball. Then in 1978 the ISOD accepted sitting volleyball in its programs. The first official tournament took place in 1979 in Haarlem, Netherlands, and then in 1980 sitting volleyball was accepted as a Paralympic sport with seven players. Since 1993, Sitting Volleyball championships have been organized for men and women. It has become one of the main team-sports in the Paralympic Programme. It is a fast, exciting and crowd pleasing sport, which can show the athletic skills of disabled sportsmen/women. Standing Volleyball for the Disabled, was played by athletes with disabilities long before the international federation was founded. It has its roots in Great Britain and was originally played only by amputee players. To encourage the participation on those ones with a more severe amputation, a classification system has been set up and players on court must follow certain rules. Teams must respect these classification rules to ensure an equitable team composition. International competitions have taken place since the 1960s, although it was not until 1976 that volleyball was accepted into the Paralympic Games Programme, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Since 1980 volleyball has had a regular international calendar. Barry Couzner (OAM) of Australia is the current president. Thomas, Nigel and Andy Smith. Disability, Sport and Society An Introduction. 2 Park Square, Milton Park,Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge,2009 Origin The game of Volleyball was created by William G. Morgan,a YMCA physical education director, on February 9, 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts (USA). When Morgan first created the game of volleyball it was called Minonette. The first rules, were written down by Morgan. The game of volleyball was not officially called volleyball until 1896 and was two separate words. As the years went on it later became one word, then a special ball was designed for volleyball in 1900. 64 years later in 1964 Men's and Women's volleyball were introduced as an Olympic sport. Later in 1884 the Men's team won its first Olympic medal and later men's beach volleyball was added as an Olympic sport in 1996. Huff, Richard. The Composite Guide to Volleyball. Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publisher, 2000 Kinds of volleyball =Sitting volleyball= Athletics and Sitzball - originating from Germany - were the main sports. Soon it was found that Sitzball, which is played sitting down on the floor, was too passive; more mobile forms of sports were looked for. With Sitting Volleyball, the disability of a player is no longer a handicap. Since players must be sitting on the floor when hitting the ball, only the skill is important, not the disability. This produces a very competitive sport. In 1956, the Dutch Sports Committee introduced a new game called Sitting Volleyball, a combination of sitzball and volleyball. Since then Sitting Volleyball has grown into one of the biggest sports practised in competition not only by the disabled in the Netherlands, but also by interested \\"able-bodied\\" volleyball players with an injury of the ankle or knee. Sitting Volleyball has the radiation to grow into a sport in which the disabled and non-disabled persons can play on a high technical level. Sitting Volleyball is played with six players per team on a smaller volleyball court with lowered nets. This version enables double leg amputees and individuals with spinal injuries and various other disabilities to play volleyball. Besides a few rules regarding physical advantages, all nondisabled rules apply. =Standing volleyball= Standing Volleyball which is the only team sport that can be played \\"standing\\" by people with physical disabilities. The Amputee athletes have a choice to play with or without prostheses. Depending on the sense of balance, some above the knee amputees will choose to play without a prosthesis hopping on a single leg. Standing volleyball is played on an integrated FIVB rules. The game of Standing Volleyball decided to allow other disability groups to take part, therefore encouraging more nations to participate. Although this initially created more classification problems, the WOVD finally, after four years, established criteria for classification, which includes those players with various arm or leg disabilities.

Fane was the fifth son of Vere Fane, 4th Earl of Westmorland and his wife Rachel, daughter of John Bence. Baptized on 31 October 1689, he inherited the estate of Burston, Hunton, Kent from his cousin Thomas Fane in 1692. Fane unsuccessfully contested Kent as a Whig in the 1713 election, being beaten by a margin of about 600 votes of about 5000 cast. After the death of Queen Anne, he contested the seat again in the 1715 election. He and William Delaune were returned on 8 February, beating the sitting Tory members by a margin of about 200 votes of about 6200 cast. The change of administration, which transferred Government patronage at the Chatham dockyards and the Cinque Ports from the Tories to the Whigs, was critical in swinging the election. Fane did not long survive his election, dying unmarried on 11 September. He left his lands to his brother, Col. John Fane, who replaced him as member for Kent in an uncontested by-election.

United States, 562 U.S. 8 (2010), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that addressed the mandatory sentencing increase under federal law for the possession or use of a deadly weapon in drug trafficking and violent crimes. In an 8-0 decision, the Court ruled that , which required a minimum five-year prison sentence, was to be imposed in addition to any other mandatory sentence given for another crime, including the underlying drug-related or violent offense. The only exception to the five-year addition applied only when another provision required a longer mandatory term for conduct violating ¬ß924(c) specifically, rather than a mandatory sentence for another crime as the defendants had unsuccessfully argued. Abbott was the first signed opinion of the Court's 2010 term.; . The newly appointed Justice Elena Kagan did not participate, having disqualified herself because she had worked on the case as Solicitor General of the United States prior to joining the Court.. Background of the case =Statutory provisions= was originally enacted as part of the Gun Control Act of 1968.Abbott v. United States, slip op. at 5. ¬ß924(c)(1) prohibits using, carrying, or possessing a deadly weapon in connection with \\"any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime,\\" and provides for a minimum sentence of five years in prison in addition to any other sentence imposed for the predicate crime. Congress amended the provision in 1998, to add that the five-year increase would apply \\"[e]xcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law.\\"Abbott, slip op. at 5. The interpretation of this \\"except\\" clause, at , was the sole issue in Abbott v. United States. =Lower court proceedings= Kevin Abbott was convicted of drug trafficking and of being a felon in possession of a firearm, which required a fifteen-year mandatory minimum prison sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act . The court added five additional years to his sentence under ¬ß924(c) for the gun possession, for a total of twenty years.Abbott v. United States, slip op. at 3-4; . Gould, in an unrelated prosecution, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, which carried a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence, and to a ¬ß924(c) violation, receiving a total sentence of sixteen years and five months.Abbott, slip op. at 4. In their respective appeals, Abbott and Gould both argued that the \\"except\\" clause at ¬ß924(c) was triggered by the mandatory minimums for the other crimes for which they were sentenced: the fifteen years for Abbott as a felon-in-possession, and the ten years for Gould for drug trafficking. Congress' intent, in their view, was to ensure that convictions brought at least five years in prison, not to add on additional years.. The Third Circuit in Abbott's case and the Fifth Circuit in Gould's both rejected their arguments and affirmed their sentences, ruling that the \\"except\\" clause only applied to sentences arising from violations of ¬ß924(c), not other crimes. Abbott and Gould petitioned to the Supreme Court for review. Noting a circuit split on the issue, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and consolidated their cases for argument.Abbott, slip op. at 5 (collecting lower court cases and noting divergent interpretations). The Court's decision The Supreme Court affirmed the decisions of the Third and Fifth Circuits, upholding the imposition of the additional five-year minimum on both petitioners in an opinion delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The Court agreed with the government's statutory interpretation, that the \\"except\\" clause is triggered only when another provision commands a longer term for conduct specifically violating ¬ß924(c).Abbott, slip op. at 14-15. \\"For example, the mandatory minimum sentence for a ¬ß924(c) offense is five years, but if the firearm is brandished, the minimum rises to seven years, and if the firearm is discharged, to ten years. ¬ß924(c)(1)(A)(i), (ii), (iii). A defendant who possessed, brandished, and discharged a firearm in violation of ¬ß924(c) would thus face a mandatory minimum term of ten years.\\" Slip op. at 3. The Court's view was that \\"Congress intended the \\"except\\" clause to serve simply as a clarification of ¬ß924(c), not as a major restraint on the statute's operation.\\"Abbott, slip op. at 16. Gould argued that the \\"except\\" clause applied to any other mandatory minimum sentence imposed, while Abbott argued more narrowly that it applied to mandatory sentences arising from the same \\"criminal transaction\\" that constituted the ¬ß924(c) violation.Abbott, slip op. at 9-10. The Court noted that Gould's sentence would remain unchanged under Abbott's formulation. Both of the petitioners' arguments, however, would often remove any penalty for a violation of ¬ß924(c) and also anomalously give shorter sentences to more serious offenders.Abbott, slip op. at 11-12. The Court considered it implausible that Congress intended to lessen the severity of sentencing under ¬ß924(c) in 1998, particularly by doing so under a bill dubbed \\"An Act [t]o throttle criminal use of guns,\\" an act that had as a \\"primary objective\\" the expansion of ¬ß924(c)'s coverage to reach firearm possession.Abbott, slip op. at 10.

Career Cappelen went on several study tours in Norway: the Gudbrandsdalen and Lom (along with Gude and Johan Fredrik Eckersberg, 1846), Sogn and Hardanger (1847), as well as several summer residence in the countryside around Holden. His paintings were characterized by breadth and originality, combined with much poetical feeling. His wild designs from Telemark with forests, lakes and streams are filled with a pathetic mood of loneliness and transience. Powerful forms of nature, especially trees and mountains block, is effective in the composition, coloring and playing in the deep moss green tones. His most productive period was between 1850 and 1852, the two last years of his life. He struggled against gastric cancer of which he died, aged 25, at D√ºsseldorf in 1852. Legacy The most important collection of Cappelen's art is in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design. The National Gallery owns three of his major works: Waterfall in Lower Telemark, Forest Lake and Dying Forest , the last unfinished, together with 26 smaller images and studies. There is a mountain landscape by him in the Oslo Kunstforening, the scene of which he took from Telemark. In 1952, a monument to him by Norwegian sculptor Dyre Vaa (1903‚Äì1980) was unveiled in a park in Holla.Dyre Vaa (Store norske leksikon) Notable works *Kvernhus, 1850 *Utd√∏ende urskog i uv√¶r, 1851 * Morkne tr√¶r, 1851 *Tjern i t√•ke, 1851 *Foss i nedre Telemark, 1852 *Skogtjern i Nedre Telemark, 1852 *Svarttjern, 1852 *M√∏llefossen, 1852 *Utd√∏ende urskog, 1852 References Attribution: * Category:Norwegian landscape painters Category:1827 births Category:1852 deaths Category:People from Skien Category:Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf alumni Category:D√ºsseldorf school of painting Category:Norwegian expatriates in Germany Category:19th-century Norwegian painters Category:19th-century male artists August Category:Norwegian male painters ","title":"August Cappelen"},{"id":"29622844","text":"Grace Stone Coates (1881‚Äì1976) wrote short stories, poetry, and news articles. She did most of her writing out of her home in Martinsdale, Montana. Coates published her first poem, \\"The Intruder,\\" in 1921 and her first series of linked stories, Black Cherries, in 1931. She co-edited and wrote for Frontier, a literary magazine edited by Harold G. Merriam, a creative writing professor at the University of Montana.  History  = Early life = On May 20, 1881, Grace Genevieve Stone was born on a wheat farm in Kansas to Heinrich and Olive Stone. She was the youngest of four children. Grace and her older sister, Helen, were born to Heinrich and Olive. The two older children were born to Heinrich and his first wife. Heinrich had a rich classical background; he taught Greek in Berlin before coming to the United States. He channeled his love of the classics into his interactions with Grace, recited poetry to her, took her on long walks to learn the names of plants and trees, and read her mythology until she could recite it from memory. Her poetry was greatly influenced by her childhood and by her father.Grace Stone Coates, Her Life in Letters, Rostad, Lee, 2004, Riverbend Publishing, Helena, Montana Her family moved to Wisconsin when she was in high school, where she attended Oshkosh State Normal School. Coates also attended the University of Chicago, the University of Southern California and the University of Hawaii. She never finished a degree, but received her teaching certificate in 1900. = Montana = Grace moved to Stevensville, Montana, to be closer to her sister Helen, and started teaching. She later moved to Butte, where she met her future husband, Henderson Coates. The two married in 1910 and moved to Martinsdale, where her husband opened a general store with his brother. Grace taught in Martinsdale from 1914‚Äì1919 and was the Meagher County Superintendent from 1918-1921. This is where she started writing. Her first poem, \\"The Intruder,\\" was published in Poetry, a Magazine of Verse.Grace Stone Coates Papers, K. Ross Toole Archives, The University of Montana-Missoula In 1927 H.G. Merriam asked Coates to help him with a literary magazine, The Frontier: A Magazine of the West. She started writing articles and poems for the magazine and before long became the assistant editor. Merriam encouraged her to get her work published, helped her find publishers, and in 1931 she published her first short story collection, Black Cherries, and her first book of poems, Mead & Mangel-Wurzel. Coates worked for the magazine based in of Northwest Montana, until it stopped circulating in 1939. During the Great Depression, Coates helped write the WPA Federal Writers' Project Montana state guidebook. Coates stopped writing seriously in the 1930s, but she continued to participate in her favorite form of writing through letters. After her death, her letters were collected and used to illustrate her life in a biography written by Lee Rostad. Grace started losing some of her mental capacity when her husband died. She began to see things that were not there, such as intruders in her house, and was found wandering around outside in the middle of the night. She had a hard time remembering when and what she ate, and suffered from malnutrition. Her neighbors in Martinsdale got together in 1963 to move her to a retirement home in Bozeman. There, with a healthy diet and adequate rest, she was able to write a column for the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. The column was named Hillcrest Highlights, for the Hillcrest Retirement Homein which she lived. Coates died in 1976 at the age of 95. According to her wishes, her body was cremated and the ashes were scattered west of Martinsdale in one of the places she loved to walk.Honey Wine and Hunger Root, Rostad, Lee, 1985, Falcon Press, Helena/Billings, Montana  Work  In the 1920s and early 1930s, Coates published well over a hundred poems and short stories. She edited for Caxton Press, Frontier, and wrote stories for local and Montana state papers. She published a short story collection and two books of poetry in the early 1930s. She also wrote many letters. Her writing drew inspiration from her childhood, her love of nature, her love for her husband Henderson, and bouts with depression. Coates stopped writing in the late 1930s. She began to write letters again when she moved to a Bozeman retirement home.Food of Gods and Starvelings, The Selected Poems of Grace Stone Coates, 2007, Edited by Lee Rostad and Rick Newby, Drumlummon Institute, Helena, Montana Historian Lee Rostad knew Coates when she lived in Martinsdale and wanted to make sure her legacy was not forgotten. After Coates's death, she took it upon herself to collect as many letters and unpublished work as she could find and publish them. Grace Stone Coates: Honey Wine and Hunger Root, was her biography, published in 1985.

The bombing caused 20,298 civilian victims during nine air raids. The aim of the Allied Forces was to prevent the use of the transport network and airfields at Foggia. The transport network was an important focal point in the deployment of German and Italian troops used to counter the Allied attacks on Southern Italy and the invasion of Sicily in July (Operation Husky). It has been claimed that the raids were too extensive and caused excessively high levels of deaths and casualties amongst the civilian population (about a third of the population were killed. The air raids continued after an armistice had been signed between the Allies and Italy due to the concentration of German troops in Foggia. The city of Foggia was awarded the Italian gold medal for civil valor on November 22, 1959, for having suffered 20,298 victims, and of the Italian gold medal for military valor on April 25, 2007. The bombing Foggia was attacked on nine occasions. Thousands of homes in residential districts, the airport, the railway station, and numerous squares and streets were totally devastated. A chronicle of the bombing of Foggia was written by Luca Cicolella in a book called \\"...e la morte venne dal cielo\\" (\\"...and death came from the sky\\"), published in 1973 and 1983, which also contained the Report made by the Monsignor Fortunato Maria Farina and sent to Pope Pius XII. > [22 July 1943] The station clock says 9.43.

It operates on the Windows platform and comes in two major versions: Scholar's Workstation, and Lingua Workstation. Both versions include: * Nota Bene, the word-processing application * Ibidem, a citation and bibliography manager * Orbis, a text retrieval application. The Scholar‚Äôs and Lingua workstations are in most respects identical, except that the Lingua version is fully functional in a number of non-Western languages and alphabets. [see below] History Nota Bene (NB) began as a DOS program in 1982, built on the engine of the word processor XyWrite. Its creator, Steven Siebert, then a doctoral student in philosophy and religious studies at Yale, used a PC to take reading notes, but had no easy computer-based mechanism for searching through them, or for finding relationships and connections in the material. He wanted a word processor with an integrated ‚Äòtextbase‚Äô, to automate finding text with Boolean searches, and an integrated bibliographical database that would automate the process of entering repeat citations correctly, and be easy to change for submission to publishers with different style-manual requirements. Siebert licensed XyWrite code from the XyQuest company, and built his programs on it: the word processor Nota Bene, with its textbase Orbis (then called Textbase), and its bibliographical database Ibidem (then called Ibid). He founded Dragonfly Software to market it. He first showed Nota Bene at the MLA convention of December 1982. Version 1 is dated 1983, and version 2, 1986. Version 3.0 came out in 1988, version 4.0 in 1992, and version 4.5 in 1995. Version 4.5 was the last NB DOS version. Nota Bene 5.0 was the first Windows version. It was shown in pre-release in November 1998, at the annual meetings of the American Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature. Scholar's Workstation 5.0 was formally released in 1999, and Lingua Workstation 5.0 in 2000. Nota Bene for Windows suite retained and refined Ibidem, Orbis, and the XyWrite-based programming language XPL. Version 6.0 appeared in 2002, version 7.0 in 2003, version 8.0 in 2006, and version 9.0 in 2010. Version 10 was released in September 2014 and version 11.5 was released in June 2016. The word processor Version 10 (the latest version is 11.5) is fully 32-bit and has an updated look that includes the option to display customized toolbars and dialog bars that take advantage of the added screen real estate provided by high-resolution screens. Nota Bene's primary clientele is academics in the humanities and social sciences, writers and lawyers‚Äîpeople who write books and articles that depend on scholarly resources and research. They can present documents using a predefined academic style (such as the Chicago Manual of Style or the American Psychological Association), or a customized style. Documents and their entire scholarly apparatus can be quickly changed from one style to another. Nota Bene contains the usual features of contemporary word processors, such as templates, spell-checking, change-tracking, outlining and hyperlinking. In addition, it provides three independent sets of footnotes/endnotes, the capacity to insert boilerplate from \\"phrase libraries,\\" the means of generating indexes, tables of contents and cross-references, and tools designed to handle book-length manuscripts Documents can be saved with the .nb extension; with a user-chosen extension (e.g., .txt, or .2010). They can be imported from and exported into most major word-processing programs via NB‚Äôs RTF filters. Up to 36 files can be open at once in the same NB window. All open documents can be saved with one keystroke. A group of documents can be logged at program shutdown, then re- opened exactly as they were. Multiple groups of files can be logged for work on different projects. The keyboard Nota Bene has a large number of built- in keyboard shortcuts. Most commands can be entered in several ways, using a mouse, menus, toolbars, the command line, or keystroke combinations. The keyboard is fully customizable: users can modify virtually all alphanumeric and function keys, using the Ctrl, Alt, and Shift modifiers in over 450 key combinations. Codes view and XPL programming Nota Bene includes both a fully editable Show Codes view, and the programming language XPL, in which both simple macros and complex programs can be written. A manual covering keyboard customization and user programming is available on the NB website.Siebert, Steven, and A.D. Woozley. Nota Bene Customization and Programming Guide, 1994, revised for version 8/9 of Nota Bene, 2006 The user list The Nota Bene user support group Discussion list for Nota Bene Users has existed since 1986,, quoting: Shalev, Michael, Itamar Even-Zohar, J-P Takala and A.D. Woozley \\"A novice's guide to the Nota Bene user's group on BITNET.\\" May 1995. and was among the earliest of such groups. Strengths and limitations The strengths of the Nota Bene word processor are speed, flexibility, customizability, the ability to handle book-length manuscripts, and integration with the Ibidem bibliographic database and Orbis textbase, using a common interface. However, it has several limitations. It is not well suited to collaborative projects, since it has no group-editing utility. It handles graphics and cellular tables far less transparently than Microsoft Word. Although NB documents can readily be converted into and out of Word and other formats, this is an extra stage when sharing documents, and the conversion process is sometimes less than perfect with text that contains large numbers of footnotes in multiple series, or text in non-Roman alphabets. The recently released and very reliable version 10 is fully 32-bit. Orbis Nota Bene calls Orbis a textbase. It is a free-form text-retrieval system accessible from within Nota Bene. Its purpose is to retrieve information from text using simple or complex Boolean searches. The retrieved information can be viewed, saved, or incorporated into existing or new documents. It can index PDFs; files with the extensions .docx, .doc, .rtf and .html; plain text; and all files written in NB. Orbis is fast; over 8 million files can be searched simultaneously. It shows matches in a table view, keywords highlighted and the full text in another panel. If the retrieved text is linked to a bibliographic record in the user's Ibidem database, Orbis can automatically insert the correct citation into the document, or open the source file for additional inquiry. Orbis can do concept-based searches. For instance, if the user makes a synonym list that associates \\"authoritarian\\" with such terms as \\"caudillo\\" \\"strongman\\" and \\"dictatorship\\", a search for \\"authoritarian\\" will also find all passages containing those words. The textbase has dedicated templates for interviews, and for searching English, Greek and Hebrew Biblical texts. It can be used to analyse congressional or parliamentary debates; lawyers use it to scrutinise case law. Ibidem Ibidem is NB‚Äôs bibliographic database. It is equipped with the citation and bibliographic rules of over 500 journals and professional associations. Bibliographical information for a book or journal need only be typed in once. Then, after choosing an academic style for a document, users can enter citations with one click. The entries are automatically formatted (as footnotes, endnotes, or in-text citation) according to the requirements of the chosen style, as are subsequent references to the same work, and bibliographies. If a publisher requires a different citation style, the user changes to that style, and all citations and bibliography change automatically. Ibidem and Orbis can be hypertextually interlinked to each other and to NB or non-NB documents. After entering a bibliographic record into Ibidem, a user can take notes in a file linked to the record, use Orbis to search for term/s, and enter material into a document with the inserted bibliographical information automatically formatted to suit the rules of the academic style being used. Ibidem includes Ibidem Plus, a user-customizable, non-bibliographical database, which can be used to enter any primarily textual information (e.g., film or CD data). However, unlike Excel, which can also organise such data, it does not have spreadsheet functions. Lingua The Lingua Workstation integrates non-Western languages into the NB word processor, Orbis and Ibidem, including Hebrew, Cyrillic and Greek, and the International Phonetic Alphabet. There are optional modules for Arabic, Persian (Farsi), Urdu, Coptic, Syriac, Ugaritic and Akkadian. Users can mix languages and orientation (left-to-right/right-to-left) in the same document or even on the same line; words wrap properly from line to line. Lingua supports entry of over 1,700 different characters; over 230 accents; breathing marks, diacritics, vowels and cantillations, in virtually any combination; conjectural characters, three levels of superscript and subscript, and multilingual case conversion. Lingua positions vowels and accents very accurately, automatically taking into account the height or width of the character and selecting the correct form for letters that vary depending on their position in a word, such as the Greek sigma. Its font- rendering table enables highly accurate placement of marks for printing. Five versions of Biblical texts are available for Lingua: the Hebrew Bible (Vocalized Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia, UBS); the Greek New Testament (UBS, 4th edition); the Septuagint (Rahlfs); the Vulgate (UBS); and the King James Version. An optional Biblical concordance-building module, Tabula, retrieves texts from up to five Biblical texts in parallel columns. Archiva Archiva, an optional module, is an always-on Web trawler. When users copy bibliographical data while online, it automatically converts the data to Ibidem format and puts them in a \\"Captured Records\\" database. It can search over 500 university, research and public libraries, including multi-library collections such as COPAC. Its Web-page-capture module can capture non- bibliographical information and turn it into Ibidem records. Its ISBN converter can configure scanned or typed ISBN numbers as Ibidem records.

The Clutching Hand (in full, The Amazing Exploits of the Clutching Hand) is a 15-episode serial produced by the Weiss Brothers in 1936, based on the final Craig Kennedy novel of the 1934 same name by Arthur B. Reeve.http://news.bbc.co.uk/dna/place- lancashire/plain/A1023148 A 70-minute feature film using a condensed version of the serial was also released in the same year.Pitts, Michael R. Poverty Row Studios, 1929-1940: An Illustrated History of 55 Independent Film Companies McFarland & Co., 2005 In it, the famous detective (portrayed by Jack Mulhall, who had portrayed the Black Ace in the serial The Mystery Squadron three years before) is assigned to solve the disappearance of Dr. Paul Gironda (Robert Frazer), a scientist who has developed a formula for synthesizing gold but vanishes before he has a chance to reveal it to his board of directors. The Clutching Hand was the last Craig Kennedy serial and the only one to be filmed as a talkie. One of the criminals, Hobart, is played by Charles Locher, who is better known nowadays as Jon Hall, and it appears that Gironda is being held prisoner by Craig Kennedy's old foe, the Clutching Hand (a faceless presence apparently played by Bud Geary, an actor who was frequently cast in such roles, and voiced by Robert Frazer). Plot The serial was based very loosely on Arthur Reeve's final novel and in it, the Clutching Hand has a new secret identity: Dr. Paul Gironda, the very man whom Kennedy is looking for. Having almost exhausted the estate of his young ward Vera, he has come up with the idea of using a fake synthetic gold formula to recoup his losses on the stock market, but just before he disappears, one of his assistants steals the notebook containing the formula. Unable to find it, he fakes his disappearance and goes into hiding, assuming the identity of Craig Kennedy's foe, the Clutching Hand, who was seemingly disposed of in The Exploits of Elaine years before. (The Clutching Hand had a totally different identity in that serial.) Supposedly holding Gironda captive in an induced coma, the Hand demands the missing pages of the gold formula from his wife and \\"daughter.\\" At the same time as Gironda vanishes, Mitchell -‚ÄìVera's real father and Mrs. Gironda's first husband ‚Äì is released from prison after serving a full sentence on a blackmail charge, forcing the Hand to try to dispose of Mitchell before Vera can learn of her true identity.

However, the serial makers ‚Äì the Weiss Brothers, in this case ‚Äì could not alter the chapter titles for some reason. This was apparently the brothers' final serial and their last Craig Kennedy adaptation, although in 1952 the Weiss Brothers produced a television show called Craig Kennedy, Criminologist.

In 1987, she married Najib Razak and they have two children, Nooryana Najwa and Mohd Norashman, and have amassed a huge amount of wealth, which Rosmah claimed to have saved since childhood.  Allegations of corruption  =1MDB scandal= Rosmah and her husband's lavish lifestyle and extravagant purchases while Najib was in power caused anger among the citizens in Malaysia. Following her husband's loss in the Malaysian 14th general election, the couple is under investigation into the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal, in which over USD$7.5 billion went missing from the fund. On 12 May 2018, three days after her husband and then incumbent prime minister lost the general election, a flight manifest stated that Najib and Rosmah were taking a private jet to Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport in Jakarta. In response, the Immigration Department, upon the orders of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, imposed a travel ban on Rosmah and her husband, barring their exit from the country. Since 16 May 2018, the Malaysian police have searched six properties linked to Rosmah and Najib as part of the investigation into the 1MDB scandal. They have seized 284 boxes filled with designer handbags, 72 large luggage bags containing cash in multiple currencies, and other valuables. The Malaysian police commissioner confirmed that the police seized goods with an estimated value of between US$223 and US$273 million. A breakdown of the items seized includes: *12,000 pieces of jewellery: 2,200 rings 1,400 necklaces 2,100 bracelets 2,800 pairs of earrings 1,600 brooches 14 tiaras *423 luxury wristwatches (notably from Rolex, Chopard and Richard Mille) *234 luxury sunglasses (notably from Versace and Cartier) *567 luxury handbags from 72 brands (notably from Chanel, Prada, Versace, Bijan, KWANPEN and Judith Leiber) 272 handbags from Herm√®s (Birkin bag) *MYR 116 million in over 26 different currencies. The police described it as the biggest seizure in Malaysian history. =Lawsuit by Global Royalty Trading SAL= On 26 June 2018, Global Royalty Trading SAL, a jewellery firm based in Lebanon, filed a suit against Rosmah over a consignment of ‚Äúmissing‚Äù jewellery. It is seeking a mandatory order for the 44 jewellery, amounting to US$14,787,770 (MYR59, 831,317.40) to be returned. It alleged that the jewellery delivered to Rosmah on 10 February 2018 were for her to evaluate and thereafter purchase those she selected, and to return the remaining. On 22 May 2018, Rosmah had acknowledged receipt of the jewellery but in her statement claims that the items were no longer with her as they had been seized by the authorities. Global Royalty said if the items may not be recoverable or unrecoverable in full or in part, Rosmah will be held liable to pay the full cost. Since the jewellery were confiscated as part of 1MDB investigation, the Malaysian government will intervene in the lawsuit by a Lebanese jeweller against her. The case will begin hearing on 27 July 2018. In its statement of claim, Global Royalty Trading SAL alleged that Rosmah was a long-standing customer and that it would send consignments of jewellery to her on her demand. This latest news created more resentment by Malaysians questioning how the wife of ex-Malaysian Prime Minister can afford to buy even one of the cheapest items on the list. Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said that the delivery by Global Royalty Trading SAL of 44 pieces of jewellery linked to Rosmah Mansor were not declared to the Customs Department, as they should be for any import of valuable goods into Malaysia. Undeclared imports are not permitted, and as a result, the jewellery could be seized. =Claims by Adi Hasan AlFardan Jewellery= Adi Hasan AlFardan Jewellery is the second high-end jeweller requesting the Malaysian police to return over US$5mil (MYR20.69mil) worth of seized jewellery which was delivered to Rosmah in March 2018.

It has been identified as a major cultural project by the Greater London Authority. History The name of the AHOY Centre is an acronym of Adventure Help and Opportunities for Youth Centre. It was officially opened in May 2004 by Anne, Princess Royal and, since then, the centre has assisted over 5,000 people to try sailing, to attend courses, and to gain recognised qualifications. The Princess Royal also revisited in 2011 to rename the specially adapted boat - which can be sailed solely by people with disabilities - The AHOY Freedom. Activities The AHOY Centre works with partners such as the Metropolitan Police, the Safer London Foundation and local London boroughs to run a variety of sailing and powerboating courses for people otherwise unable to take part in watersports due to physical disability or social disadvantage. The charity is an accredited RYA sailability centre and has instructors, boats and launching equipment that enable it to provide tailored sailing courses for people with serious disabilities, including those in wheelchairs. This equipment includes a 40 ft long power-boat, the first of its kind in the world, that is designed so that it can be crewed entirely by people with disabilities. The boat has CCTV cameras allowing the crew to easily view all angles around the craft, and state-of-the-art controls that can be used just with small finger movements. In addition, the centre's partners in the probation service and the police refer to the centre youths identified as being at-risk due to their home circumstances or their association with gang violence or religious fundamentalism. Such youths benefit from the structured environment, the new and challenging activities, and the presence of strong role models. They may go on to gain qualifications and even become instructors in their own right. As one put it: Volunteers and staff Around 230 volunteers of all ages assist at the centre, where they may take on a variety of roles. Younger children are taught to sail, with the aim of becoming instructors later, and also assist with centre maintenance and boat repairs. Appropriately qualified adult volunteers may instruct sessions, drive a safety boat, or assist from the shore. Alternatively, they may help with a variety of administrative tasks. A small number of paid, full-time staff manage the day- to-day running of the charity, including outreach, fundraising and managing volunteers. The overall running of the charity is done by a board of trustees. Fundraising The AHOY Centre receives grants from Local Government bodies, including the Safer London Foundation. It has received around ¬£170,000 in National Lottery funding over a number of years. It also relies heavily on independent fundraising and donations. In June 2010, two teams of rowers raised money for the centre by successfully rowing across the English Channel in Thames waterman cutters.

It is motile via peritrichous flagella. It is a member of the family of Enterobacteriaceae. The members of this family are the part of the normal flora of human and animal digestive tracts. C. koseri may act as an opportunistic pathogen in a variety of human infections. Brain abscesses have a high rate of mortality and complications, therefore, neonates usually left with severe residual permanent damage. The transmission of C. koseri could be vertical from mother to fetus (local vaginal infection, rupture of the membranes, chorioamniotis may occur between the seventh and 11th day prior to delivery) and other sources can be horizontal nosocomial transmission by asymptomatic nursery staff. Signs and symptoms The neonates become very sick and present sepsis, meningitis, and cerebritis, seizures, apnea, and a bulging fontanelle. No evidence of stiff neck or high-grade fever is present. =Complications= Occasionally, it causes meningitis, but it can cause sepsis, ventriculitis, and cerebritis with 80% frequent multiple brain abscesses in low-birth-weight, immunocompromised neonates; rare cases have been reported in older children and adults, most of whom have underlying diseases. Arterial and venous infarctions are possible because of the bacterial infiltration along the main vessel; exudates within the ventricles and ventriculitis may obstruct the ventricular foramina and result in a multicystis hydrocephalus with consequent long-lasting shunting difficulties, and necrotizing meningeoencephalitis with pneumocephalus has been reported. =Pathogenicity= The pathogenic mechanism is poorly understood. C.koseri may have a unique ability to penetrate, survive, and replicate into vascular endothelial cells and macrophages. Furthermore, it survives in phagolysozomal fusion and replicates within macrophages, which may contribute to the establishment of chronic abscesses. Diagnosis =Medical imaging= Early and massive tissue necrosis is a specific feature of C. koseri brain infection. The early stage of the disease predominates in the white matter, causing cerebritis; the later stage is marked with necrotic cavities in multiple locations. The cavities are initially square in shape and not tense, but when pus forms and collects in these cavities, they tend to become more rounded in shape; a persisting cavity leads to septated ventriculitis that may result in multicyctic hydrocephalus. Early, cerebritis is seen, and multiple large cavities can be seen in the late stage of the disease; abscesses formation, contraction of the cavities, and hydrocephalus due to ventriculitis are observed in the late follow up. =Pathology= Macroscopic findings include purulent exudates, opaque leptomeninges (thinning of meninges), pus, and ventriculitis/ ependymitis. =Microbiology= In samples collected from cerebrospinal fluid, C. koseri grows well on an any ordinary medium; they produce unpigmented, colorless mucoid colonies. If incubated for 24 hours in other media such as indole, citrate, and adonitol, C.koseri will be positive, hydrogen sulfide negative in Kligers‚Äô iron agar, negative results in lactose, salicin, and sucrose broth as well. . =Histology= C. koseri may be identified in the walls of congested vessels, presence of the cavities resulting from the infection do not develop well- formed fibrotic wall. =Differential diagnosis= The differential diagnosis of C. koseri brain abscesses can be confused with other related diseases, so diagnostic imaging is important to confirm this bacterium. The significant feature of C. koseri is the necrotic cavity which cannot be misidentified as earlier ischemic or hemorrhagic insult or other mass lesions; congential/neonatal tumors are uncommon (choroid plexus papillomas, craniopharyngiomas, teratomas); even when they present, they are different from the inflammatory ring of a cerebral infection. Early cerebritis should not be mistaken for normal, immature white matter, nor for cicatricial leukomalacia. Treatment A broad spectrum cephalosporin and meropenem are often used because of the good penetration into the central nervous system. If the response to the antibiotic is poor, the surgical aspiration of the collected pus reduces the mass effect and enhances the efficacy of the antibiotics. Prognosis The prognosis of the C. koseri infection is 20 to 30% of neonates die, and 75% of survivors have significant neurologic damage such as complex hydrocephalus, neurologic deficits, mental delay, and epilepsy. Control The most effective way to reduce transmission of organisms is regular handwashing.

The play sympathetically portrays a group of Silesian weavers who staged an uprising during the 1840s due to their concerns about the Industrial Revolution. The play was translated into Yiddish by Pinchas Goldhar in the 1920s, after which it became a favorite of the Yiddish stage. In 1927 it was adapted into a German silent film The Weavers directed by Frederic Zelnik and starring Paul Wegener. A Broadway version of The Weavers was staged in 1915‚Äì1916.The Weavers at the Internet Broadway Database Plot summary Poster for a Federal Theatre Project presentation of The Weavers in Los Angeles (1937) Most of the characters are proletarians struggling for their rights. Unlike most plays of any period, as pointed out many times in literary criticism and introductions, the play has no true central character, providing ample opportunities for ensemble acting. Criticism Barrett H. Clark's comments: \\"as one of Gerhart Hauptmann's experiments in dramatic form, The Weavers is highly significant. Instead of a hero, he has created a mob; this mob is, therefore, the protagonist‚Äîor chief character‚Äîand if individuals emerge from the rank and file they are not thrust into the foreground to stay long. It is the weavers as a class that is ever before us, and the unity of the play is in them and in them alone; they are only parts of a larger picture which will take shape as the story advances, and are not intended to be taken as important individuals.\\"Barrett H.

The bacteria have a long rod shape with a typical length of 1‚Äì5 Œºm. Most C. freundii cells generally have several flagella used for locomotion, but some do not and are non-motile. C. freundii is a soil organism, but can also be found in water, sewage, food and in the intestinal tracts of animals and humans. The genus Citrobacter was discovered in 1932 by Werkman and Gillen. Cultures of C. freundii were isolated and identified in the same year from soil extracts. C. freundii is a common component of the gut microbiome of healthy humans. While most strains are beneficial, there are significant phenotypic variations among strains, even those that share >99% of their genome. Some rare strains of C. freundii have been associated with opportunistic nosocomial infections of the respiratory tract, urinary tract, blood, and many other normally sterile sites in immunocompromised patients. C. freundii is also commonly found to be a member of the soil microbiome. This microbe plays an important role in the nitrogen cycle in the environment. C. freundii is responsible for reducing nitrate to nitrite in the environment. This conversion is an important and crucial stage in the nitrogen cycle. Some members of the species are nitrogen-fixing and have been found in tissues of living sassafras trees. C. freundii has also been investigated for biodegradation of tannic acid used in tanneries. C. freundii has the ability to grow on glycerol, and use it as its sole source of carbon and energy. The organism contains a bacterial microcompartment which is capable of processing propanediol. C. freundii creates a positive MR and negative VP test along with a positive Catalase and negative Oxidase test. C. freundii cannot hydrolyze starch, lipids, or gelatin.

It was founded by Otto Bremer in 1944 and owns 92 percent of Bremer Bank. In 2016, the Trust made a record $47 million in grants and program- related investments. The trust makes grants and program-related investments in Minnesota, North Dakota, and western Wisconsin in communities where there are Bremer banks. The organization changed its name from Otto Bremer Foundation in 2015.  History  Portrait of Otto Bremer Otto Bremer was a German-American immigrant who came to the United States in 1886. He worked in several jobs before becoming a bookkeeper at the German American National Bank, where over the next 36 years he rose to become chairman of the American National Bank. He was an investor in independent rural banks throughout the Upper Midwest and during the Great Depression used his own assets to help support many of these banks. He partnered with his brother Adolph in the ownership and management of the Jacob Schmidt Brewing Company, St. Paul, Minnesota. He served as treasurer of the City of St. Paul for more than a decade and became an advisor to Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt.Ibid. Bremer established the Trust to perpetuate Bremer banks and help support the communities in which they are located.  Mission  The Trust invests in people, places and opportunities in the Upper Midwest, recognizing not only the individuals and communities of the region where the Trust operates but also the increasingly diverse needs of dynamic organizations throughout the region which present unique and compelling opportunities for the Trust's investment.  Grantmaking  The Trust accepts grant applications from organizations located in communities where there are Bremer banks. Highest priority is given to opportunities with the potential to move a community forward in meaningful, powerful and broad-based ways. This broadness of vision is intentional in order to encourage innovative responses to community opportunities and challenges. Since its founding, the Trust has made over $700 million in grants and program-related investments to organizations in the Upper Midwest.Ibid. 3.  Governance  The Trust is managed by three full-time co-CEOs and trustees. In addition to oversight of the Trust's grant making and program-related investments, the trustees also serve on the board of Bremer Financial Corporation, parent of Bremer banks, and help manage an investment portfolio which supports the Trust's philanthropic efforts. The Trustee position is not merit-based; rather, it is passed down from parents to children, with no job interview or search for qualified candidates. This is an issue which was mentioned by Paul Olson in an Op-Ed apropos the pushing out of its Executive Director in 2014. Not unlike other private charities created by their founders, trustees are often individuals who are either family members or close business confidants. Trustees have the authority to name a successor.Bremer Financial Corporation, et al. v. S. Brian Lipschultz, et al., Second Judicial District Court, Ramsey County, Minnesota (Complaint, Exhibit A, Nov. 19, 2019). According to the Trust's 990-PF for 2017 (its tax return), the trustees have grown the Trust's resources since 2014, increasing annual distributions from $42,296,824 in 2014 to $50,212,684 in 2018, while keeping expenses at 11.24 percent, well below the level of its peers.  Organizational Realignment  In 2014, the Trust embarked on a realignment that more effectively structured the organization for the future. As part of the changes, the Trust realigned its philanthropic leadership into seven regions spanning Minnesota, North Dakota and western Wisconsin, with a dedicated staff member serving as each region's point of contact.  Strategic Options for Bremer Financial Corporation  On Oct. 28, 2019, the Otto Bremer Trust announced that it had ‚Äúcommenced a process to explore strategic options for BFC,‚Äù which could lead to a sale or merger of Bremer Financial Corp. (BFC), parent of Bremer Bank. OBT is the 86 percent owner of BFC. According to a press release issued by OBT, ‚Äúthe organization believe[s] it is necessary to fulfill our legal obligations and is in the best interests of the individuals and communities that OBT serves. A successful transaction would enable an incredibly significant increase in OBT‚Äôs philanthropy and allow us to expand our work in Minnesota, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Montana.‚Äù Financial analysts estimated that BFC could be worth in excess of $2.2 billion. At that value, OBT's 5 percent annual payout as required by the IRS would double from $50 million per year to $100 million per year.  2019 Litigation  On Nov. 19, 2019, Bremer Financial Corporation (BFC) filed a lawsuit in response to the Trust's Oct. 28, 2019, announcement to explore strategic options, accusing the three trustees of the Otto Bremer Trust of acting in a \\"disloyal scheme.\\" The 165-page complaint contends that, among other things, the disloyal scheme included actions such as hiring an investment banker to solicit offers for the bank and sharing confidential information without approval.Bremer Financial Corporation, et al. v. S. Brian Lipschultz, et al., Second Judicial District Court, Ramsey County, Minnesota (Complaint, Nov. 19, 2019). The Trust said that it was disappointed that the bank has \\"chosen a path of obstruction and conflict in this matter. In doing so, they are acting in a manner that seems certain to hurt the bank and its employees, to waste the resources of the company and to hurt the people Otto Bremer dedicated his life and fortune to helping. The allegations in the lawsuit are false and without merit.‚Äù The trustees filed their answer and counterclaim in the lawsuit on December 9, 2019.Bremer Financial Corporation, et al. v. S. Brian Lipschultz, et al., Second Judicial District Court, Ramsey County, Minnesota (Answer and Counterclaim, Dec. 9, 2019).  Criticism  In July 2014, the executive director of the trust was abruptly \\"pushed out in a restructuring of the organization.\\" The three trustees subsequently became co-CEOs, creating a title that allowed for their uncharacteristically large salaries; according to the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, \\"In 2013 alone, the trustees received more than $1.2 million from the foundation, compared to the $24,000 median trustee compensation among the country's largest foundations.\\" Furthermore, the trustees' total salaries grew rapidly over the course of a decade, increasing from $124,500 in 2004 to over $1.2 million in 2013 alone, a 1000 percent increase. This led Aaron Dorfman, the executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy to \\"detail his organization's findings in a letter to Tamera Ripperda, IRS director for exempt organizations . . . A further examination of IRS tax records by NCRP showed this ousting was only the latest in a series of troubling decisions, inducing the watchdog group to call for an investigation by the Minnesota Attorney General.\\" Dorfman also speculated about the increase in legal fees apparent from the Foundation's tax forms, writing \\"Given the millions involved, another question begs to be answered: Are the trustees diverting other foundation assets for personal enrichment?\\". According to the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, \\"In 2013 alone, the trustees received more than $1.2 million from the foundation, compared to the $24,000 median trustee compensation among the country's largest foundations.\\" Furthermore, the trustees' total salaries grew rapidly over the course of a decade, increasing from $124,500 in 2004 to over $1.2 million in 2013 alone, a 1000 percent increase. Another response came from Paul Olson, who wrote an Op-Ed in the Star Tribune, in which he observed that \\"At Bremer, the criticisms include excessive trustee compensation of more than half a million dollars annually (after a 1,000-percent increase over 9 years); concentrating the roles of CEO, chairman and treasurer with the trustees; and firing the foundation‚Äôs executive director to justify the increased salaries.\\" Olson continued his Op-Ed by drawing parallels between the Blandin Foundation's 1977 scandal: \\"Frankly, it‚Äôs out of the same playbook of self-interest dressed up as charity. The lawyers who wrote the playbook in each case were from the same law firm.\\" Olson further notes the similarity between the trustee's salaries and those of the presidents of Minnesota's higher education systems, allowing him to sharply contrast the qualifications and workload required for the respective positions: \\"But the academic leaders got their appointments on the basis of a national search, not from their fathers. They have Ph.Ds and are nationally ranked scholars. They manage budgets in the billions, employ thousands, and report to public boards as well as to the governor and the Legislature.\\" Olson concludes his Op-Ed with the imperative that \\"... Bremer trustees should tear up the pre-1969 tax-dodging, self-perpetuating private-bank, nepotism-driven trust arrangement and get on with philanthropy in the best Minnesota tradition.\\" and stating that \\"The judge and the AG should demand that Bremer reform, and the Minnesota Council on Foundations should provide guidance. Voluntary compliance is better than coercion.\\" Trustees have served as the co- chief executives of the Trust since 1944. Critics have alleged that the trustees face no oversight in setting their compensation plans. Those plans are developed by professional compensation consultants and reflect the guidelines set by the Trust's founder, Otto Bremer. The plans are presented for approval to the Ramsey County District Court and were approved most recently in a court order dated December 26, 2017.In the Matter of the Otto Bremer Trust (formerly known as the Otto Bremer Foundation), Second Judicial District Court, Ramsey County, Minnesota (Dec. 26, 2017).

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 as part of the Natchez Trace Parkway at milepost 232.4.

He is most famous for commercials for Nestl√© chocolate featuring Farfel the Dog. He also hosted a children's show sponsored by Nestl√©. Early life Jimmy Nelson was born in Chicago, Illinois on December 15, 1928. When he was ten years old, his aunt won a toy ventriloquist's dummy named \\"Dummy Dan\\" in a Bingo game and gave it to her nephew for Christmas. He learned ventriloquism, and a year later, his father upgraded the dummy's mouth control from a simple string-and- loop to a lever-system like those used in professional ventriloquist's dummies. Nelson began taking \\"Dan\\" to school, where his fourth-grade teacher allowed him to use the dummy when speaking in front of the class. In this way, Nelson taught himself to overcome his fear of public speaking. He soon started using jokes in his presentation, discovering he could make his classmates laugh. He then started performing for church groups, schools and American Legion posts. By the time he was a teenager, he started earning money competing in amateur talent contests held at the local movie theatres, where the prize was five dollars for the most popular act. Professional career In 1945, Nelson asked famed Chicago ventriloquist figure maker Frank Marshall to make him a professional-quality dummy. Marshall, who had made Paul Winchell's Jerry Mahoney, would only do this after seeing the ventriloquist's work. He came to one of Nelson's theatre performances and was impressed, so sold Nelson a custom-made dummy, which he always carved to bear a resemblance to the ventriloquist. Nelson gave Dummy Dan's replacement the full name Danny O'Day, which he chose because it contained none of the consonants impossible for ventriloquists to say without moving the lips, unlike \\"McCarthy\\" and \\"Mahoney\\". He then hired a manager and started touring professionally. By 1947, Nelson was a professional success and Danny O'Day began to show signs of wear, so Nelson hired Marshall to build him a second one. However, Marshall's hand-carved originals (which he tailored to the personality of the ventriloquist) were impossible to duplicate identically, and Nelson felt the second dummy didn't look sufficiently like Danny to replace him. So he decided to maintain Danny, and added heavy eyebrows, eyeglasses and a beret to the new dummy, creating a foil for Danny named Humphrey Higsbye. In September 1950, Nelson made his first appearance with Danny on The Ed Sullivan Show. In the late 1950s, Jimmy Nelson released two LP records, One being \\"Pinocchio\\", which involved his four major dummies, which was released on Cricket Records in 1959, and the other being \\"Jokes and Riddles\\", which was done before a live audience of children, released on Rocking Horse Records. =Farfel the dog= One night that year, while working a late show in a Wichita, Kansas nightclub, he picked up a stuffed dog a patron had left on the piano, and improvised a low-pitched voice to make it talk. This gave him the idea for a new character which he had Marshall build. He named it Farfel, after the Jewish pasta dish he had seen on the menu of the Borscht Belt resorts in upstate New York where he performed. His famous line was: \\"No, I wouldn't say that.\\" =Television career= In 1950, Nelson was hired as a regular on the Texaco Star Theatre TV show hosted by Milton Berle. Nelson and Danny O'Day would appear in Texaco gas jockey uniforms. At one point, he added another animal dummy to his character repertoire, a cat named Ftatateeta after a character in George Bernard Shaw's play Caesar and Cleopatra. The cat's voice was based on Ed Wynn's. In 1954, Nelson served as emcee on the game shows Bank on the Stars and Come Closer. In 1960, he hosted a 30 minute local TV show in New York titled \\"Studio 99-1/2\\" on WNTA-TV, channel 13. The show, complete with a cast of hand puppets and dummies all voiced by Nelson, generated the release of two children's LP's on Cricket Records, \\"Pinocchio\\" and \\"Peter and the Wolf\\". =Nestl√© commercials= In 1955, the Nestl√© company hired Nelson to do commercials selling their chocolate candy and Nestl√©'s Quik chocolate milk flavoring. The Nestl√© executives had him audition by spontaneously performing their newly written jingle. Nelson sang the first two (musical) lines in Danny's voice: :N-E-S-T-L-E-S, :Nestl√©'s makes the very best... He finished with Farfel slowly singing the last word \\"chocolate\\", in two syllables. Nelson was so nervous that his hands sweated, and when Farfel was finished, his finger slipped off the control, causing the mouth to audibly snap shut, a mistake no ventriloquist should make. Nelson left the audition thinking he had blown it, but was surprised to learn he was hired; in fact, the executives actually liked the mouth-snapping effect and asked that he keep it. This became his trademark as the commercials ran for ten years. When advertising Nestl√©'s Quik, Danny O'Day would say it \\"makes milk taste...like a million\\" (dollars), again slowly and pausing for effect. =Film career= In 2009, Nelson was featured in the ventriloquist comedy documentary I'm No Dummy, directed by Bryan W. Simon. Later years Nelson and his wife Betty were residents of Cape Coral, Florida since the 1960s. He appeared with Danny and Farfel at local schools and was a long time spokesperson for First Federal Savings and Loan of Fort Myers. Nelson was dubbed \\"The Dean of American Ventriloquists\\" in 2011. Nelson collaborated in 2011 with maker of professional ventriloquist figures Tim Selberg to produce a character that pays homage to his Danny O‚ÄôDay. He died on September 24, 2019, at the age of 90, from complications of a stroke suffered earlier in the year.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/arts/television/jimmy-nelson-dead.html Family Nelson and Margot's three children were twins Larry and Lee, and a third son Jerry.

It was first described by Peruvian archaeologist Rafael Larco Hoyle in the 1940s from the Pampa de los F√≥siles site.Tom Dillehay, The Settlement of the Americas, p. 145. Later research, mainly by French archaeologist Claude Chauchat, identified dozens of open air sites, which include camps, workshops and quarries.Dani√®le Lavall√©e, The first South Americans, pp. 97‚Äì98. Generally, this culture would belong to the Lithic stage of cultural development. Geography Most findings are concentrated along the valleys of the rivers Jequetepeque, Cupisnique, Chicama and Moche in the northern coast of Peru; more limited evidences of Paij√°n presence have been found in the central and south coasts of Peru as well as in the highland site of El Inga in Ecuador.Tom Dillehay, The Settlement of the Americas, pp. 145‚Äì146. Environment The Paij√°n environment was arid with sparse vegetation and small animals such as rodents, lizards and snails; further resources were provided by the sea which at the time was located 15 kilometers farther than today due to a .lower sea level.Dani√®le Lavall√©e, The first South Americans, p. 98. To adapt to this environment, the Paij√°n developed long needle‚Äìlike projectile points which were mounted on hollow shafts of cane or reed and be used as harpoons to catch fish; they also collected snails, hunted small animals such as vizcachas and used grinding stones to process plants.Michael Moseley, The Incas and their ancestors, pp. 93‚Äì94. =Paijan projectile points= Paijan stemmed points are separated into several classes when being classified as they are found on sites. These classes include: lanceolate, triangular, intermediate, and miscellaneous. * Lanceolate: have convex-sided bodies with a ‚Äúmaximum width that is different from the base; the tip is very long, thin and sharp‚Äù.‚ÄúThe Paijan Complex, Pampa De Cupisnique, Peru‚Äù, Claude Chauchat in √ëawpa Pacha: Journal of Andean Archaeology, 13, 1975 * Triangular: have ‚Äústraight sides with a maximum width that is located at the base of the body‚Äù.‚ÄúThe Paijan Complex, Pampa De Cupisnique, Peru‚Äù * Intermediate: have a ‚Äúmaximum width that may be at the base of the convex-sided body or convexity may be so poor that attribution is dubious‚Äù.‚ÄúThe Paijan Complex, Pampa De Cupisnique, Peru‚Äù * Miscellaneous: have stemmed points that do not fall within the other three classes‚Äù.‚ÄúThe Paijan Complex, Pampa De Cupisnique, Peru‚Äù Common tools Common Paijan tools used included single and double sidescrapers, unifaces ‚Äì pieces or tabular blocks retouched on one face only all around the edge to give them an ovate shape, borers ‚Äì rare small jasper blocks that have 3 points, and most abundantly - denticulates which have thick, steep edges. Bifaces are another common artifact found on Paij√°n sites.‚ÄúThe Paijan Complex, Pampa De Cupisnique, Peru‚Äù Time period Early Paij√°n sites, dated between 8,600 and 8,000 BCE, indicate large bands that moved seasonally between the coastal plains and the western slopes of the Andes; later sites, dated between 8,000 and 6,500 BCE, evidence smaller groups of decreased mobility.Tom Dillehay et al, \\"The first settlers\\", pp. 21‚Äì22. According to anthropologist Tom Dillehay, a possible explanation for this change is that an amelioration of the climate increased the availability of wild plants and animals; thus, Paij√°n people required less movement to meet their requirements while still relying on hunting- gathering.Tom Dillehay, \\"Profiles in Holocene History\\", p. 38. =Oldest human remains= In 1975, at La Pampa de los F√≥siles, Claude Chauchat discovered skeletal remains of a teenager about 12-13 years old, and of a young woman of about 25 years old, buried in a layer of ash. Radiocarbon studies gave an age of 10,200 ¬± 180 before present. They are therefore considered as the oldest human remains in Peru.

Its premiere in the Lyttelton auditorium of the Royal National Theatre was directed by Howard Davies.http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/8257/past-events/past- productions-19861990.html British revivals of the play have included one at the Salisbury Playhouse in 2001 and at the Lyric Theatre, London in 2003. Hare later adapted it as 1993 film of the same title, also directed by Davies. It is set in 1980s Britain and examines the impact of Thatcherism on personal relationships within the family of a junior government minister after her father's death. Hare states that its title refers to a nun's feeling of ecstasy on being received by God at the moment of her death, rather than the Protestant concept of the Rapture. Synopsis Estranged sisters Isobel and Marion are forced to reunite when their father dies and they must decide how to handle Katherine, their young, alcoholic, mentally unstable stepmother who has been left nothing but the rural home in which they were raised. Isobel and her lover Irwin own a small graphic design company that is struggling to stay afloat. Her sister suggests she and her born-again Christian husband Tom help them expand the business by finding investors and making Katherine a partner responsible for finding new business. Isobel has grave misgivings about the plan, but finally agrees to it when Marion convinces Irwin of its potential success. Before long, the strain of running the expanded business causes a deterioration in Isobel's relationship with Irwin, who is becoming increasingly dependent upon her, while at the same time Katherine's tenuous hold on sanity begins to unravel. Plot =Act 1= Scene 1 Isobel is sitting with the body of her father Robert, who has just died. Her elder sister Marion arrives to claim a ring she had given him and the two sisters begin to argue. Marion's husband Tom arrives and Marion leaves, angry with Isobel, then Tom and Isobel talk before leaving. Scene 2 Isobel and her father's second wife, the alcoholic Katherine, sit in the garden of Robert's house just after his funeral. Marion and Tom arrive and an argument begins when Katherine suddenly introduces her idea that she would like to join Isobel's small design firm. Katherine storms out and finds a hidden bottle of drink before returning, whereupon the previously doubtful Isobel agrees that Katherine can join the firm. Scene 3 In the office of Isobel's firm she and her lover Irwin attempt to enjoy a rare evening without Katherine, until Katherine arrives to tell them how she has taken Isobel's friend Max out to dinner. Katherine criticises Irwin's design work before leaving and Irwin tries to convince Isobel to get rid of her. Katherine returns and, when Isobel proves unable or unwilling to eject Katherine, Irwin intervenes and asks Katherine to leave in the morning. Katherine leaves temporarily and Isobel refuses to agree to her ejection from the firm. Scene 4 Back at Robert's house, Marion and Tom try to convince Isobel to let them invest in her firm to help it expand, with Irwin betraying Isobel by supporting them rather than her. =Act 2= Scene 1 Marion's secretary Rhonda comes round to Isobel's firm's new offices for a shower, and she and Irwin flirt over a bottle of champagne until Isobel arrives back unexpectedly. Rhonda leaves for the shower and Isobel reveals that Katherine has stabbed one of the firm's clients and so has had to be put into a rehab clinic. Isobel and Irwin argue and Rhonda returns to the office before leaving to go to the cinema. Isobel surprises her and Irwin by suggesting that they come too and the three leave together. Scene 2 The expansion of Isobel's firm having failed, Marion and Tom wait in Tom's office, to which Irwin comes for a business meeting. He tells them how Isobel left the cinema halfway through the film and took a spur-of-the-moment holiday to Lanzarote, before returning to care for Katherine. He also admits how he is still in love with Isobel despite the friction that now exists between them and Marion criticises her sister's handling of the situation. Isobel arrives and refuses to come into the office until Irwin leaves. Irwin leaves, Isobel enters and she and Marion argue until Isobel finally leaves. A born-again evangelical Christian, Tom then criticises Marion and leaves to pray for Isobel and Irwin. Scene 3 In the lounge of Katherine's flat, Isobel attempts to make her dinner and the two talk before preparing a sofa-bed for Isobel to stay the night. Katherine leaves for her bedroom and Isobel settles down to read, before Irwin arrives, thanks to Katherine who has secretly disobeyed Isobel and unbolted the door so he can get in. Irwin has brought a gun with him and begs Isobel to sleep with him - she refuses and the pair argue. Katherine returns and Isobel fails to convince her to go out to get the police to eject Irwin. Isobel then prepares to go out and Irwin shoots her just as she leaves. Scene 4 Back at Robert's house, Marion, Tom and Katherine reinstate its furniture and prepare for Isobel's funeral. Katherine leaves and Tom and Marion discuss her emotional difficulties. They then kiss and Tom leaves, before Marion ends the play with an emotional appeal to her dead sister.

By the 1890s, he was in a partnership with Joe R. Lane. with In the 1990s the Davison house was the River Oaks Inn Bed and Breakfast. It currently houses Gilda's Club of the Quad Cities. Architecture The house was built in two different phases and it marries two different styles. The original house was built in the Tuscan form of the Italianate style in the late 1850s or early 1860s. This was the popular style employed by Davenport's wealthier citizens for their homes in this era. This section of the house is the cube- shaped structure on the east side. The two-story wing on the west side was added in the early 20th-century. While it shares some features with the original house, such as the hipped roof, its windows are organized in horizontal bands, which are typical of the Prairie School. Both sections are brought together with the stucco exterior. There was possibly a cupola on top of the original house that was removed as were the brackets from under the eaves.

He didn't start antiretroviral therapy until several years later and struggled with adherence, experiencing several side effects and being hospitalized more than once later in the 2000s. In an interview he has spoken about struggling with AIDS in the American healthcare system and reliance on Ryan White programs as well as suffering from depression and keeping his HIV status secret, including from his family.

Oregonian Gretchen Jones took first place, and Hawaian Andy South ‚Äî now Ari South ‚Äî came in third. Project Runway executive producer Heidi Klum ‚Äî who had pushed for Guerra to win over Jones in a lengthy split debate over the winner ‚Äî appeared in a modified version of one of Guerra's final collection gowns for the Los Angeles premiere of the movie Black Swan a few weeks after the airing of the final episode.

shall be a department of social services the head of which shall be the commissioner of social services.\\" in charge of the majority of the city's social services programs. HRA helps New Yorkers in need through a variety of services that promote employment and personal responsibility while providing temporary assistance and work supports. Its regulations are compiled in title 68 of the New York City Rules. The current Commissioner of HRA is Stephen Banks, who was appointed to the position in April, 2014 by Mayor Bill de Blasio. HRA is the largest city social services agency in the United States. It has a budget of $9.7 billion, employs over 14,000 people, and serves over 3 million New Yorkers. HRA Programs =Cash Assistance= HRA's Family Independence Administration (FIA) provides temporary cash assistance under the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program and the New York State Safety Net program. Eligibility is based on factors such as income and family size. Participation in an employment or training program is required for anyone receiving temporary cash assistance. =Food Stamps= The Family Independence Administration also provides access to food stamps to low- income families and individuals. The food stamp program is known as SNAP, which stands for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. =Employment Services= HRA's Employment Services, a part of the Family Independence Administration, connects HRA clients with employment and training opportunities in the private and public sector. Many employment services programs combine subsidized work and on-the-job training with guided job hunting and workshops on resume writing and interviewing skills. =Public Health Insurance= HRA used to provide healthcare services and information through the Medical Assistance Program. With the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, HRA now mainly caters towards specific Medicaid applicants, such as those over 65 or have disabilities. =Long Term Care Services= The Long Term Care Services Program offers a wide variety of in- home, community based or institutional assistance programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities who need medical care and help with daily tasks. =Home Care Services= The Home Care Services Program (HCSP) provides Medicaid-funded care programs to seniors or disabled individuals that allow them to remain safely in their homes, instead of a nursing home or other institution. Clients must be eligible for Medicaid to receive these services. =HIV/AIDS Services= The HIV/AIDS Services Administration (HASA) helps New Yorkers living with AIDS or HIV gain access to benefits and support. HASA clients may receive help with medical care, housing assistance, direct links to other HRA services such as food stamps, employment services, and counseling. HASA was first created as a unit serving clients with HIV/AIDS in 1985, then expanded into the Division of Aids Services and Income Support in 1995. In 2000 it became the HIV/AIDS Services Administration. =Domestic Violence and Emergency Intervention= The Office of Domestic Violence (ODV) provides support and temporary shelter for victims of domestic violence and their children. ODV can provide counseling and advocacy on a client's behalf, and help them obtain other HRA benefits they are eligible for. =Adult Protective Services= Adult Protective Services (APS) provides case management and services for mentally or physically impaired adults who are at risk of harm. APS assists adults suffering from abuse, neglect, financial exploitation or hazardous living conditions and provides them with service plans that help them live safely within their homes and communities. =Child Support Services= The Office of Child Support Services (OCSS) serves parents (both mothers and fathers) and guardians, regardless of income or immigration status. OCSS assists custodial parents in getting a child support order in place, facilitate the receipt and disbursement of child support payments, and refer unemployed noncustodial parents to employment services and other programs. OCSS also refers parents to mediation services to resolve disputes and participates in several outreach programs to promote responsible fatherhood. =Energy Assistance= The Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) provides assistance with heating bills and equipment repairs to low-income renters and homeowners. =Health Insurance Access= The Office of Citywide Health Insurance Access (OCHIA) helps connect uninsured New Yorkers with the NY State of Health. OCHIA operates NYC Health Insurance Link, a website which helps individuals and businesses understand insurance options. Organization New York is divided into fifty-eight local social services districts. In New York City, the five boroughs (counties) compose one district, whereas outside of New York City each district corresponds to one county. Administrative reviews (\\"Fair Hearings\\") are handled by the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, Office of Administrative Hearings. History =New York Social Services Before HRA= Social services in some form have existed in New York City since shortly after the first settlers came to what was then the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam in the 1600s. Early programs were usually run by churches and private charities. As an English colony, New York's social services were based on the Elizabethan Poor Law of 1598-1601, in which the poor who could not work were cared for in a Poorhouse. Those who could were employed in a Workhouse. The first Poorhouse in New York was created in the 1740s, and was a combined Poorhouse, Workhouse, and House of Corrections. As poverty increased in the 1800s, more private charities and public initiatives were created to deal with the issue. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many social work-based private charities merged with government agencies, and New York became a leader in developing social work-oriented public service organizations. The Great Depression was a catalyst for social service organizations to go further in addressing the needs of the poor and unemployed across the nation, and the New Deal led to an expansion in the type and amount of aid provided to low income families, and increased cooperation between public and private social service providers. =Creation of HRA= The Human Resources Administration/Department of Social Services was created on August 15, 1966, by consolidating many of the city's existing social service administrations under Mayor John Lindsay‚Äôs Executive Order No. 28. The city agencies combined to form HRA included HRA Central Operations and the Department of Welfare, the Manpower and Career Development Agency, the Community Development Agency, Youth Services Agency and Addiction Services Agency. The Administration initially had two chief officers, the Administrator of the Human Resources Administration and the Commissioner of the Department of Social Services. In 1970, these positions were combined into the office of Commissioner. HRA was initially created as a ‚Äòsuper-agency,‚Äô housing all of the city's social service programs. In 1993, the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) became a separate city agency, and in 1996 the Administration for Children's Services (ACS) was also separated from HRA. =Welfare Reform= In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), more commonly known as welfare reform. This required social services agencies around the country to shift to a work-first philosophy that emphasized job training and employment services combined with temporary aid and work supports. The Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program was replaced nationwide with Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). In 1998, the first phase of welfare reform was implemented in New York City under HRA Commissioner Jason Turner. The Agency's Income Support Centers were converted to Job Centers. Since the implementation of reforms in New York City, the Cash Assistance Caseload has declined to its lowest level since 1964, while enrollment in work support programs like Food Stamps has increased.

Furnese was abroad at the time of the 1708 British general election, but shortly after his return from the Continent, he was returned unopposed as Whig Member of Parliament for Truro in a by-election on 16 December 1708. He voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. There was pressure for Furnese to stand for Thetford at the 1710 British general election, but he was appointed to the Commission of the Peace for Kent and returned in a contest as Whig MP for New Romney. He voted for the ‚ÄòNo Peace Without Spain‚Äô motion on 7 December 1711. On the death of his father on 30 November 1712, he succeeded to the baronetcy and a large estate at Waldershare, Kent. He was returned unopposed for New Romney at the 1713 British general election and voted against the expulsion of Richard Steele on 18 March 1714 At the 1715 British general election, Furnese was returned in a contest as a Whig at New Romney on his own interest. He voted for the septennial bill, and in 1717 followed Robert Walpole into opposition. He voted against the Government on Lord Cadogan in June 1717 and opposed the Peerage Bill in 1719. At the 1722 British general election he was returned unopposed for New Romney. At the 1727 British general election, he was returned as MP for Kent while he was defeated at New Romney. After being awarded the New Romney seat on petition, he decided to remain as MP for Kent. From 1729 he voted against the Government. Furnese was married three times. His first wife was his stepsister Anne Balam (1688-29 May 1713), the daughter of his father's second wife Matilda Vernon and her first husband Anthony Balam. They married on 1 October 1708 and had one daughter, Anne, who married the Hon. John St John, son of Henry St John, 1st Viscount St John. Anne, Lady Furnese, died on 29 May 1713 aged 25. His second marriage on 8 July 1714 was to Arabella Watson, daughter of Lewis Watson, 1st Earl of Rockingham. She was the mother of Furnese's only son Henry and his second daughter Catherine, who married her first cousin Lewis Watson, 2nd Earl of Rockingham. Arabella died on 5 September 1727. He married thirdly, on 15 May 1729 at Teddington, Middlesex, Lady Anne Shirley, daughter of Robert Shirley, 1st Earl Ferrers. By his last wife, he left a daughter Selina who married Edward Dering.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The home is named for two members of the United States House of Representatives who lived in the house, Hiram Price and Henry Vollmer, who both represented Iowa's 2nd congressional district. The building is now a part of the campus of Palmer College of Chiropractic where it houses the Office of Strategic Development.  Hiram Price Hiram Price (1810‚Äì1901) was a native of Washington County, Pennsylvania and moved to Davenport in 1844. He was a businessman in the city and became involved in local politics. Price was an advocate of the Temperance Movement and worked to pass the prohibition of liquor in the state of Iowa. He also was involved in establishing the railroads in Iowa. Politically, he was a Democrat until they tried to force slavery in Kansas. At that time he helped to form the Republican Party in Iowa. He supported Iowa's governor, Samuel Kirkwood, by raising both men and money to support the Union cause during the Civil War. Price represented the second district of Iowa in Congress twice, from 1861 to 1869 and from 1877 to 1880. In 1881 he was appointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs by President James Garfield. He died in Washington, DC in 1901. He was buried in Oakdale Cemetery in Davenport.  Henry Vollmer  Henry Vollmer (1867‚Äì1930) was a native of Davenport who worked as an attorney and served the city as its mayor from 1892-1896. During his five terms as mayor the streets in the older part of town were paved and the current city hall was built. The city was also able to weather the financial panic of 1893. Vollmer won a special election in 1914 to the House of Representatives to fill the seat of Irvin S. Pepper, who died in office. Unlike Price, Vollmer did not support the prohibition of alcohol. He died in California. Architecture The house was built by Price in 1870. It is a two-story Italianate structure built of brick. The dominant feature of the house is the three-story entrance tower. The arched windows have decorative hoods. Bracketed eaves and a hipped roof cap the house. An unusual feature of the house is the bowed front wing on the north side. with The corners of the house and tower are quoined. The veranda on the south side of the front main level was enclosed and covered with permastone at one time. It has since been restored.

In the presence of calcium, calprotectin is capable of sequestering the transition metals iron, manganese and zinc via chelation. This metal sequestration affords the complex antimicrobial properties. Calprotectin is the only known antimicrobial manganese sequestration protein complex. Calprotectin comprises as much as 60% of the soluble protein content of the cytosol of a neutrophil, and it is secreted by an unknown mechanism during inflammation. Faecal calprotectin has been used to detect intestinal inflammation (colitis or enteritis) and can serve as a biomarker for inflammatory bowel diseases and rheumatoid arthritis. Other names for calprotectin include MRP8-MRP14, calgranulin A and B, cystic fibrosis antigen, L1, 60BB antigen, and 27E10 antigen.  Structure  Crystal structure of Mn2+ and Ca2+ loaded calprotectin, showing two S100A8-S100A9 dimers. The grey and blue chains represent S100A8 and S100A9, respectively. Purple spheres represent Mn2+ and green spheres represent Ca2+. Only one manganese ion can bind per calprotectin dimer. The human homologue of calprotectin is a 24 kDa dimer, and is formed by the protein monomers S100A8 (10,835 Da) and S100A9 (13,242 Da). The primary structure of calprotectin can vary between species. For instance, the mouse homologue of S100A8 is 10,295 Da, while the S100A9 homologue is 13,049 Da. Early size exclusion chromatography experiments incorrectly indicated that calprotectin had a molecular mass of 36.5 kDa; occasionally this value is used in contemporary literature. Calprotectin S100A8-S100A9 dimers can non- covalently pair with one another to form 48 kDa tetramers. = Metal binding = Calprotectin has a high affinity for calcium, zinc, iron, and manganese. Each of S100A8 and S100A9 contain two EF-hand type Ca2+ binding sites, and calprotectin is able to bind a total of four calcium ions per dimer or eight calcium ions per tetramer. Calcium binding induces a conformational change in the complex that improves its affinity for transition metals, and promotes tetramer formation. A maximum of two transition metal ions may bind to each calprotectin S100A8-S100A9 dimer. A calprotectin dimer can bind only one manganese or iron ion with high affinity, and it can do this only in the presence of calcium. Zinc can bind at two sites within the calprotectin dimer, and this can occur in the absence of calcium. Calcium, however, improves calprotectin's affinity for zinc. While calprotectin metal binding occurs at the interface of S100A9 and S100A8 monomers, the independent monomers have some capacity for zinc binding, and may contribute to zinc homeostasis within mammals. His6 coordination of Mn2+ in calprotectin. S100A8 histidine residues are coloured grey, S100A9 histidine residues are coloured purple. The first of the two calprotectin metal binding sites consists of a His3Asp motif, with S100A8 contributing two histidine ligands (His83 and His87), and S100A9 contributing a histidine and an aspartic acid ligand (His20 and Asp30). The second site can coordinate metals through a tetra-histidine (His4) or a hexa- histidine (His6) binding motif. In the case of His4 binding, S100A8 coordinates through both His17 and His27 while S100A9 coordinates through His91 and His95. In hexa-histidine binding two further histidine residues, His103 and His105, are recruited from the C-terminal end of S100A9 to enable octahedral coordination of the transition metal. Manganese or iron are bound by the calprotectin dimer at this His6 site. Zinc can be bound to either of the sites that form at the interface between S100A8 and S100A9 monomers.  Inflammatory disease  Calprotectin constitutes up to 60% of soluble protein content in the cytosol of neutrophil granulocytes, and it can be found at a lower concentration in monocytes, macrophages, and squamous epithelial cells. Calprotectin enters into pus and abscess fluid during neutrophil cell death, along with other antimicrobial proteins. Mammalian cells secrete calprotectin during the inflammatory response. Plasma calprotectin is elevated in persons with metabolic syndrome, a disease characterized by chronic inflammation. Calprotectin is secreted in the mouth during inflammation of the gingiva and during oral candidiasis infection. People who have mutations in the calprotectin gene appear susceptible to serious gum infections. Manganese sequestration by calprotectin is likely important during lung inflammation. The exact mechanism by which S100A8 and S100A9 is secreted by mammalian cells during inflammation remains unknown.  Antimicrobial properties  Transition metals are essential to the survival of all organisms. Mammals strictly limit metal availability as a part of the innate immune system, and this helps prevent infection by microbes and fungi. Calprotectin was first described in the 1980s as a mammalian antimicrobial protein that acts through the sequestration of zinc. It is now known that calprotectin also has antibacterial and antifungal properties that arise from its ability to sequester manganese and iron. Calprotectin is the only known antimicrobial agent that acts through manganese sequestration.  Faecal calprotectin  Calprotectin becomes available in the intestinal lumen via leukocyte shedding, active secretion, cell disturbance, and cell death. This results in elevated faecal calprotectin levels, which can be detected in the stool. Elevated faecal calprotectin levels therefore indicate migration of neutrophils into the intestinal mucosa, which occurs during intestinal inflammation. As people with active inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease have as much as a 10-fold increase in faecal calprotectin levels, the measurement of faecal calprotectin can serve as a biochemical test for these diseases. Although a relatively new test, faecal calprotectin is regularly used as an indicator for IBD during treatment and as a diagnostic marker. Faecal calprotectin tests can also function in distinguishing patients with irritable bowel syndrome from those with IBD. Calprotectin is useful as a marker, as it is resistant to enzymatic degradation, and can be easily measured in faeces. Although faecal calprotectin correlates significantly with disease activity in people with confirmed IBD, elevated faecal calprotectin can be a false-positive indicator of IBD under some conditions. Importantly, intake of proton pump inhibitor is associated with significantly elevated calprotectin values. Furthermore, positive faecal calprotectin does not help in localizing IBD, or in distinguishing ulcerative colitis from Crohn's disease. Faecal calprotectin can also indicate other gastrointestinal conditions such as colorectal cancer, gastroenteritis, and food intolerance. Calprotectin levels vary depending on age, comorbidity, and may vary day-to- day within individuals. Faecal calprotectin could be used as a preliminary screen in otherwise functional patients suspected of having IBD, or as a means of following mucosal healing. The potential for using faecal calprotectin in this way is debated, however, and cut-off levels have not been agreed upon.

In the third episode, he asks Ruth Evershed to dinner where he offers her a job as his new security adviser, a job she accepts in episode four and takes up in the fifth episode. Although Towers is through and through a politician and clashes with Harry when intelligence matters rivals with the UK's current interests, he is one of Harry's strongest allies and always indulges him as much as he can. He even said in their first meeting that he considered him a hero. It was only reluctantly that Towers handed him over to the CIA in the tenth series and he promised to support him in whatever decision he made about his future at MI5 after Ruth's death.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1983, and on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties since 2000. In 2020 it was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District. It is known locally for the large painted sign on the north side of the building depicting the Bix 7 Road Race. History The building was rebuilt in 1901 to replace the original 1893 structure that was destroyed by fire, and was commissioned by sisters Margaret and Rebecca Renwick. It is frequently (but wrongly) attributed to their brother William Renwick, who was a prosperous area industrialist in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Two of the family's Davenport houses are also on the National Register of Historic Places, the Renwick House on Brady Street and the Renwick Mansion, which is a contributing property in the St. Katherine's Historic District. The reconstructed building contained 40,000 square feet of combined retail and warehouse space and was designed for tenant Drake Furniture & Carpet Co.; it continued to house various successor furniture stores over the years. The storefront was modernized in the 1930s. with The building sat empty until 2012 when Restoration St. Louis, who also renovated the Forrest Block and the Hotel Blackhawk, began a $4.5 million renovation of the building. The upper floors house 18 loft-style apartments and commercial space on the main floor. Architecture The Renwick Building is a steel frame and red brick commercial building. The four-story building is an outstanding example of the Chicago Commercial Style. It was designed by the Danish architect Frederick G. Clausen and his firm Clausen & Burrows, and constructed by Davenport contractors C.E. Osborn and John Peters. The brick fa√ßade acts as the building's skin around the steel frame, which supports the structure. This approach allowed a greater expanse of windows, which are found in this building. Decorative elements are found at the top of the building. Romanesque Revival arched windows in a tri-partite configuration line the fourth floor on the facade, and the building is topped with a heavy ornate cornice.

The restaurant was on Queensway, a very popular street in London. It was very well known to Nigerians, especially those who visited the UK regularly. They patronized it a lot. He bought one there and another one in an area called Fulham in Chelsea from the same person. He also had two health clubs. But when he wanted to relocate, He sold some and retained a couple of them.

Civil rights leadership Ms. Post has been a social justice advocate since the 1950s when the Civil Rights Movement was first organized in Louisville. Sit-ins at segregated businesses were followed by the open housing movement which challenged the cultural norms in real estate transactions that kept homeowners separated by race and religion. In 1969 Post became President of the Kentucky Civil Liberties Union (later the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky).Kentucky chapter of the ACLU formed in 1955 (formerly known as the KCLU) to defend the free speech rights of civil rights activists and those protesting the Cold War arms race and war, \\"Our History\\" American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky. http://aclu-ky.org/content/view/51/108 . Accessed September 16, 2010. The KCLU provided legal representation for those arrested at many open housing marches, and Post worked with others to raise bail before an open housing law was finally adopted. While President of the KCLU, Post organized the first statewide women's conference and served as chair of the Kentucky Pro-Equal Rights Amendment Alliance. Representatives came from a cross section of Louisville's social justice community, and Mayor Harvey I. Sloane afterwards provided the Louisville-Jefferson County Human Relations Commission with funds to hire staff to monitor discrimination against women. Post worked for the local Commission for eight years. By 1972 the KCLU and the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights both filed a school desegregation lawsuit against the Louisville-Jefferson County Board of Education which led finally to the development of a controversial busing plan in 1975. As the mother of five children in public schools at that time, Post was seen by the group advised by Robert Sedler (KCLU's volunteer general counsel and tenured law professor at the University of Kentucky) to be the best candidate to serve as the plaintiff. By 1975 the court-ordered desegregation policy for the Jefferson County Public School system was one of the first in the country.Haycraft v. Board of Education of Louisville, No. 7291, Memorandum Opinion and Judgment (W.D. Ky. March 8, 1973), rev'd, 489 F.2d 925 (6th Cir. 1973) & 521 F.2d 578 (6th Cir. 1975). The controversy surrounding race-based decisions in placing students in Louisville's public schools continued in 2000 when the desegregation policy was overturned then challenged by five African- American students, leading to the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education which ruled unconstitutional the use of race in determining assignment of students in Louisville's public school system. Post also monitored the educational institutions' compliance with Title IX prohibiting sex discrimination in education.Fosl, Catherine, and K'Meyer, Tracy E.

When she was elected to the National American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Board of Directors, she organized a women's caucus to improve the status of women on the national board, and directed the strategy planning in 1972 whereby the National ACLU made women's rights its top priority.

The main campus is located in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan at 515 Audubon Avenue at the corner of 190th Street. History Isabella Uhl 1846 - 1873 When Anna and Oswald Ottendorfer opened the first home in 1875, they named it in honor of Anna's daughter, Isabella Uhl, whose early death at the age of 27 cut short her career in caring for the poor. Isabella had been impressed by the precarious position of aged women without home or family. When confined to bed, Isabella expressed to her mother the wish that she establish an institution to ensure these women refuge and protection. Two years after Isabella's death, Anna Ottendorfer opened Isabella Heimath in Astoria, Queens. The home was originally dedicated to the care of indigent elderly women, per Isabella Uhl's wishes. Isabella Home moved to its present location in 1889 and simultaneously expanded its mission to care for both women and men, without regard to race, creed or nationality. ISABELLA HEIMATH, AMSTERDAM AVENUE AND 190TH STREET Ca 1890 In 1899, the United States Commission to the Paris exposition of 1900 requested that Isabella Heimath provide photographs for an exhibition on American Charities. For this submission, the home was awarded the silver medal for excellence of its building, services and purposes. After 76 years Isabella outgrew its capacity of 132 residents and the Board of Managers moved to make provisions for more space and expanded services. On December 7, 1965, Nelson A. Rockefeller, then Governor of New York State, dedicated Isabella House, a 17-story building containing 12 floors of furnished apartments, three floors of nursing care and two floors for services and public spaces. The House provided independent living for approximately 250 aged residents. This affordable housing residence for the well elderly was a new concept in institutional care for the aged. At the time, it was the first housing program for the elderly which offered medical and nursing care and a package of social services in a setting where personal freedom and independence was assured. The growth from 132 to approximately 500 residents made it apparent that the original Isabella Home needed to be replaced. Consequently, on April 3, 1972, the 14-story Isabella Nursing Home building was opened. The combination of facility and program expansion in the next few decades helped to create the present day Isabella Geriatric Center. The 1990s once again called for changes and new goals; Isabella began a move to create a more home-like ambiance for residents. For 25 years, from 1991 to 2016, Isabella offered a child care center that, along with the geriatric center provided a unique inter-generational program that benefited both the children served and the residents. In June 2016 Isabella abruptly closed the child care center with little notice. =COVID-19= There are 98 people who may have died from COVID-19 at the Isabella Geriatric Center. On April 30, 2020, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced that her office would investigate complaints about the center.  Current work Today, Isabella is a large complex offering a diversity of services. In addition to a 705-bed nursing home, Isabella offers independent senior housing, adult day health care, home care, short- and long-term rehabilitation and a variety of community programs designed to help older adults remain healthy while living at home. Other community-based programs include: *Naturally Occurring Retirement Community (NORC) Programs *Senior Resource Center *Institute for Older Adults (50+ Club and Walking Works Wonders) *Career Training *Upper Manhattan Partnership for Senior Independence *Caregiver Support Programs =Person centered care model= The Isabella Geriatric Center and Cobble Hill Health Center have been engaged in an ongoing collaboration to explore new ways to enhance person centered care and to construct a model that uses performance improvement approaches to guide staff in addressing the needs and preferences of residents.

Plot summary Hobart Struther's voyage is interrupted by the death of his horse in a desert. Out of frustration, he kicks it. He stands trying to figure out what to do. Struther made millions by buying cheap paintings and reselling them. In a midlife crisis, he has abandoned his wife and rich life for a trip to understand himself. The former art dealer laments his condition. He must bury the horse. This proves to be very difficult. Next he debates different facets of his personality and life, looking as he mentions several times for authenticity, until every angle seems doomed to failure. Performance history Kicking a Dead Horse premiered at the Abbey Theatre of Dublin in 2007, starring the Irish actor Stephen Rea, and then with the same actor at New York's The Public Theater and the Almeida Theatre in London in 2008.

It is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. The island is crossed by the CSX Susquehanna River Bridge on the north side and the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge on the south side. Geography The Cecil Observer, quoting the Chesapeake Bay Journal, describes the geologic history of Garrett Island: \\"'Garrett Island is the geologic remnant of what was once an offshore volcano in an ancient sea. The rocky high ground on the island's west side is the remains of the volcanic core. Basalt and quartz formed by the volcanic activity are still present.'\\" Garrett Island is the only rocky island in the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay. History Human presence on Garrett Island is known from 8,000 to 5,000 years ago. John Smith may have visited the island in 1608 but there is no definitive documentation proving this. In 1622, the island was given to Edward Palmer as part of a land grant by King James I, and the earliest documented European presence dates to 1637 when William Claiborne established a trading post on the island. In the same year, Maryland troops evicted Claiborne's Virginia traders from the Upper Chesapeake region and built Fort Conquest on what was then called \\"Palmer's Island.\\" During the later colonial period, the island was farmed by a family named \\"Watson\\" and it eventually came to be called \\"Watson Island.\\" Watson Island was purchased by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) in the 1880s so a bridge could be built across the Susquehanna River at that point. The island was named after John W. Garrett, then president of the railroad. Wildlife Garrett Island provides habitat for 44 species of birds including eagles, common loons, tundra swans, and 14 species of ducks.

From here it travels south and then east on Sand Hill Road before turning southeasterly on Sardis Road then ending at North Carolina Highway 191 (Brevard Road) in the Asheville community of Venable. Though both ends are within the city limits, short portions of the road exit the city. Throughout most of the length, the Pisgah National Forest's border is located on the south side of the road. History The NC 112 designation first appeared in 1930 as a new routing, running from US 19/NC 10 (present-day now US 74/US 441) near Wilmot to NC 107 (present-day US 19) at Cherokee. Around 1938, this routing was re-designated as North Carolina Highway 107-E, onto which present-day US 441 and US 441 Business run. In 1940, NC 112 reappeared as a new primary routing, running from US 19/US 23 at Candler southwest to the Buncombe-Henderson county line. During the early 1950s, NC 112 was extended east along US 19/US 23 via an overlap and then southeasterly to NC 191. Around 1963, the original western segment between Candler and the county line was renumbered as NC 151, leaving only the present day routing between Enka and Venable.

Government risk is considered a general risk categorisation primarily used to describe the potential impact of changes in legislation or policies of the executive branch within existing legislation, uncertainty due to electoral factors or demonstrated behaviour of a government or jurisdiction that increases likelihood of instability and therefore uncertainty of decision making. Managing government risk exposure can be achieved through existing internal risk management processes, adherence to ISO standards via custom tools or through third party expertise. Unlike broader and well accepted definitions for related issues such as political risk, government risk has a more micro focus on specific risk issues or indicators that may be unique to a project, reform or investment such as regulatory issues or poor reputation of actors in question due to previous compliance failures which elevate the government risk profile for that specific matter (and in the latter case, the reputational risk of the actor in question is a leading indicator of potential elevated government risk). An example of government risk is when poor behaviour of an industry or sector leads to a government policy or regulatory response, such as the range of reforms to the Australian financial services sector arising out of the 2017-2019 Australian Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry including a specific targeting of the financial advice sector. This specificity of issues and indicators means government risk can be assessed at a subnational level such as a province or state government jurisdiction or even at local government level. In an investment context, it is typically referenced as distinct from other forms of risk, such as market risk, credit risk, price risk, and natural risk when assessing the viability of an investment project.  Distinction from Country Risk  It is often confused with the term \\"country risk\\" when assessing investments in foreign countries, but government risk is in fact a subset of country risk. Specifically, government risk refers only to interactions with government, but not the following elements of country risk: * crime and property security * currency risk * different cultural norms around business ethics * monopolies or business conglomerate power within in- country markets References Category:Financial risk ","title":"Government risk"},{"id":"29626514","text":"Dave Dunaway was a wide receiver in the National Football League.

Described as strong-willed, he arrives as Walford's new general practitioner. He departed on 26 December 2011, following the end of his domestic abuse storyline with his wife Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia) in which he served as the show‚Äôs main antagonist. Bhatti was voted \\"Best Newcomer\\" at the TV Quick awards and for \\"Best Storyline\\" for destroying the Masoods. Storylines Yusef first appears when Afia introduces him to her boyfriend Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel). Tamwar feels he is not good enough for Afia in Yusef's eyes as he is from a poor background, but Yusef says that does not matter and approves of Tamwar. After Tamwar mentions his mother Zainab Masood's name, Yusef visits the Masood home and finds the door open. When Zainab sees him, she screams and orders him out. It is revealed they were husband and wife from an arranged marriage when Yusef was 17,and Yusef's family had poured oil on her and set her on fire. Yusef says it was his family, not him, and he attempted to save her, revealing bad scarring on his body. Tamwar's father Masood Ahmed, Tamwar and Afia return home, and Masood attacks Yusef, punching him twice. After Yusef returns, Tamwar asks Masood to speak to Yusef, and when he visits, he finds out Tamwar and Afia are still seeing each other. He gives his blessing for them to be married. Yusef becomes the local general practitioner for Walford and takes an interest in Denise Fox (Diane Parish). He is later pickpocketed by Janine Malloy (Charlie Brooks). Denise tells Yusef that there have been rumours about him going round, Dot Branning (June Brown) is responsible so he goes and talks to Dot; she ignores him. Zainab tells Yusef that Afia will be welcome to the family but he will not. Yusef reminisces about the past leading to Zainab telling Masood they must stop the wedding. Yusef starts a relationship with Denise. Yusef encourages Zainab and Masood's estranged son Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) to take the first step in making amends as he is gay, and Syed goes to Tamwar and Afia's mangni (engagement party). The roof collapses and Syed is hospitalised and Yusef lies to Zainab that Syed could die so she visits him, but his injuries were not serious noticing that Yusef tricked her. Yusef makes out that he is sleeping with Zainab so Masood and Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) then kidnap Yusef in an attempt to scare him away. Masood threatens to pour petrol over Yusef, though it is only water and leaves him unharmed. When Masood returns home, Yusef has cuts on his face and blames it on Masood. Everyone believes Yusef and Masood is rejected from his home. Yusef convinces Tamwar, Afia and Zainab that Masood should not be at the mehndi. At the wedding, Masood turns up to try to stop it but Tamwar reveals that he and Afia already married. Yusef's cousin Tariq (Antony Bunsee) arrives and he reveals that Yusef started the fire that burnt Zainab. After hearing news that Syed is trying to find his wife Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas), Yusef visits her father, Qadim (Ramon Tikaram) at his office and offers to avenge his family for causing Amira pain. When Zainab and Yusef attend an event together, people assume they are married and Zainab does not correct them. Afterwards, Yusef admits to Zainab that he has great feelings for her but they should maintain some distance as she is married. Yusef continues to manipulate Zainab and ply her with pills, but she says she wishes to stop taking them, so Yusef crushes up a bottle of pills and conceals them in Zainab's food. Zainab passes out and is hospitalised, with her family believing she took a deliberate overdose, as was Yusef's plan. Concerned that he himself is causing Zainab's worries, Masood divorces Zainab by saying the triple talaq. Yusef learns that Amira gave birth to Syed's daughter Yasmin, so persuades Zainab to take a holiday with him and Kamil in Pakistan. While there, he suggests that they move there permanently as a family. On their return to Walford, Yusef learns that Amira has been seeing Syed, so tells Amira that she is not wanted by the Masood family. Amira ignores him and Zainab meets Yasmin, and informs Yusef that she cannot leave Walford after becoming a grandmother. Yusef then puts doubt into the mind of Syed's boyfriend, Christian Clarke (John Partridge), about Syed's paternity of Yasmin. Christian then asks Yusef to perform a secret paternity test on Yasmin, however Yusef uses his own DNA for the test, creating a false result. However, his falsification is exposed, leaving the Masood family hostile towards him, and Zainab devastated. Later, Yusef tells Zainab that he told the lies to protect her. She is sceptical, but when Yusef revives Amy Mitchell (Natalia and Kamil Lipka-Kozanka) who has almost drowned, Zainab is impressed with Yusef's caring attitude, but says it does not change things. Amira goes to Yusef for help, saying she needs him on her side, threatening to tell Zainab that Yusef bought her a plane ticket if he does not help her get Syed back. She convinces Zainab to talk to Yusef, and when Yusef sees 15-year-old Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe), who has recently come out as homosexual, running out of Christian's flat, he asks if Christian acted inappropriately. At first Ben says nothing happened but later Ben tells Yusef that Christian touched him, and they tell Ben's father, Phil. This turns out to be untrue, but leads to Christian leaving Syed and Walford. Yusef continues to manipulate Zainab, to the point of becoming violent with her. Yusef then tries to encourage Zainab to move to Pakistan, and recruits Amira to manipulate Syed with the same idea. As Zainab starts to disrespect his wishes, Yusef slaps her and apologises as he thought he was going to lose her. Yusef meets up with Tariq and offers him his daughter's restaurant. Upon discovering that the restaurant doesn't belong to Yusef, he reveals to Afia that Yusef started the fire involving Zainab. Afia then tells Yusef she knows he started the fire and threatens to tell Zainab if he does not do so first. Yusef admits to Zainab that he started the fire and kicks him out of the house, she later forgives Yusef however. Yusef and Zainab then marry. After Zainab and Jane argue in the street Zainab and Yusef return home. Zainab slaps Yusef after he says Kamil will be an outcast to him but Yusef slaps Zainab back. Yusef then hastily arranges a flight for himself, Zainab and Kamil to Pakistan, but Zainab purposefully discards her passport to prevent the trip. Yusef then kidnaps Kamil, telling Zainab that he is being kept in a safe place and refuses to let Zainab see him. After about four days of not knowing, Yusef takes Zainab to a caf√© in the High Street, where a relative returns Kamil to Zainab. During the visit, it emerges that Yusef told Bushra's family that Zainab had a nervous breakdown, which is why he needed to have Kamil looked after. When Yusef takes a call outside the caf√©, Zainab tries to escape with Kamil through an emergency exit in the back of the shop. However, Yusef guessed her plan and was waiting for her outside the exit. As she tried to escape, Yusef warned her that he knows everything, and if she leaves him, he will kill Tamwar and Kamil. Masood races to the restaurant and secretly promises that he'll do whatever it takes to get her out of her marriage to Yusef. Zainab finally stands up to Yusef and refuses to leave for Pakistan. Yusef attacks her and after learning that Masood has Kamil, retaliates towards Yusef. Yusef drugs Zainab, and the family return to the house. Masood punches Yusef before calling the police. Afia confronts Yusef and orders him to leave. Yusef is later found by Masood at the bed and breakfast with a match and some petrol. Yusef attacks Masood and lights a fire leaving Masood for dead. Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Christian put the fire out but the fire is later reignited trapping Masood, Phil and Denise inside. Yusef taunts Zainab outside. Zainab lies and tells him that Afia is in the building and he runs in followed by Tamwar. Masood is later rescued and as Yusef remains upstairs he realises that Afia is in fact outside. Realising Zainab tricked him, he briefly smiles, and the floor collapses beneath him and he succumbs to the flames, killing him. The following day, firefighters retrieve his body. He leaves everything to Zainab in his will. Creation and development =Casting, introduction and departure= Bhatti was already known to EastEnders executive producer Bryan Kirkwood when he auditioned for the part, as Kirkwood and Bhatti worked on Coronation Street at the same time. Bhatti was the only actor who auditioned for the part of Yusef. In fact, Wadia recommended Bhatti to Kirkwood to play Yusef, as she \\"thought that he definitely had the quality that Yusef would need‚Äîwhich is a very ambiguous but charming quality!\\" Bhatti explained to Digital Spy that the EastEnders cast are very welcoming. He explained: \\"They're so welcoming. There's a lot of joking about. I'm having a great time at EastEnders - it's a real privilege to be here. I've known Nitin and Nina Wadia, who plays Zainab, for a very long time and we've always got on very well. Nitin and I play tense scenes together so it's nice that we can have a laugh afterwards.\\" Yusef is introduced as part of a storyline involving the Masood family. Tamwar dates Afia and when Yusef is introduced to Tamwar's parents Masood and Zainab, Masood \\"explodes\\" with anger at the sight of him, recognising him as a man from their past. Ganatra explained that although Yusef allegedly tried to save Zainab from the fire, all Masood saw was Zainab locked in a burning kitchen: \\"we are only playing it from each person's point of view. Yusef is playing it from his point of view that he did try and save her. Masood is saying, 'All I know is that I went back to get her and she had been locked in this kitchen and it was on fire'.\\" Patel said the storyline is a shocking one with a clever twist. In March 2011, Bhatti said he was staying with EastEnders until around June 2011, and would \\"see from there\\". He made his first appearance on 23 November 2010. Ganatra spoke at the British Soap Awards 2011 to Digital Spy and praised the impact of Yusef saying,\\"He's very much an arch-villain - he's a great character who's there to put jeopardy into the Masoods' relationship. Zainab and Masood have been married for 28 years and they're mad about each other - for someone to come and destroy that slightly, it's exciting. It's exciting for us to play.\\" Bhatti's departure was not announced. When a fire was reported to be happening around Christmas 2011, rumours emerged from an alleged EastEnders insider that \\"Yusef has long been tipped as a possible fatality\\". The insider added \\"This is the biggest fire EastEnders has ever seen and there will be casualties. It is such a huge disaster that it will affect most of the families on the show in one way or another. There is a great tradition at EastEnders of captivating Christmas Day storylines and this year is no different.\\" Yusef's death aired on 26 December 2011 concluding his storyline. =Personality= On the EastEnders website, Yusef is described as calm, collected, strong-willed, mysterious, loyal to Afia and regretful of his past. Daniel Maier from The Guardian said that Yusef \\"is clearly a wrong 'un but it's hard to tell exactly what his game is. You suspect he's not sure himself. A Baddie Without Portfolio, most of his time seems taken up with malicious glances and general inveigling.\\" Susan Hill from the Daily Star called Yusef \\"twisted\\", while Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror called him \\"smug, deceitful and dangerous\\". Wadia opined that Yusef is not evil but much more complex than that, and his personality would be explored during his storyline. =Storyline development= In an interview with Digital Spy, Bhatti described his relationship with his daughter Afia, explaining that they have a \\"strong bond\\" and that Yusef would die for his daughter. He said that \\"it definitely hurts\\" when he finds out that Tamwar and Afia are already married as he is so close to Afia and she has betrayed him. In an interview with Inside Soap, Bhatti admits that he is sympathetic for his character, Yusef. He said that Yusef is very insecure and that he can understand his behaviour in some ways. Meanwhile, discussing the fan reaction to his character, Bhatti admitted that women have told him that he's a \\"bad man\\". Bhatti also hinted that Yusef will become more firmly established as a Walford villain over the next few weeks, stating that Yusef does have more bad qualities than good and that fans call him \\"Dr. Evil\\". Yusef is wrongly accused of having an affair with Zainab, due to his sister-in-law overhearing them speaking. A source said that the whole day turns into a disaster. When Shameem sees Yusef and Zainab together she automatically thinks they're having an affair and everyone struggles to come to terms with what they have heard. Bhatti has admitted that he is surprised by his status as a heartthrob. Interviewed by Will Payne of the Sunday Mirror, he said that it's a great compliment however, it was a complete surprise. Bhatti hinted that perhaps women love the character, but he prefer trainers and jeans to smart suits. Kidnap In April 2011, it was reported that Masood would kidnap Yusef, pour petrol on him and threaten to set him on fire. Yusef will then go to the Masood's house and tell Zainab what Masood has done. An EastEnders insider told the News of the World, \\"Masood has never got over that. Tension has been simmering for a while and leads to an outpouring of violence from Masood that leaves Yusef seriously injured. But Yusef will get his own back. It is a twisted love triangle that will also show the sometimes brutal side of arranged marriages. It's not clear if their marriage will survive Yusef's meddling. [...] Yusef obviously wants [Zainab] back and will do anything he can to drive a wedge between Masood and Zainab.\\" Ganatra said that Yusef will turn \\"very manipulative and very nasty\\" and Masood finds him as a big threat saying, \\"He throws a real spanner in the works for Masood. [...] He is doing everything he can to wreck Masood's life, really, and the way you do that is to get to his family. It's a very clever way of doing things‚Äîit's not about destroying his family, it's about winning his family and turning them against him, so that Masood is left isolated and on his own.\\" Ganatra spoke of the storyline saying, \\"I think there's rumours of revenge! Yusef is a really nice catalyst - he's a very exciting character to throw into the mix. If it goes that way, it's more drama for us to play.\\" The scenes were broadcast on 2 June 2011 with Phil Mitchell also taking revenge alongside Masood. Domestic violence In late 2011, Yusef manages to win his former wife back. They later make plans to get married. Nina Wadia explains why Zainab is willing to forgive Yusef. Wadia said to Inside Soap: \\"He tells Zainab that he was forced to start the fire by his family. Yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong the minute he lit the match, and that he ran into the house to save her. And by the end of this conversation, she finds herself saying to him, 'Let's get married' - regardless! Obviously, it was something I struggled to get my head around. But being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common - and that experience connects them so deeply. She recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that the whole thing was probably her fault, because she walked out on their marriage.\\" Wadia continued: \\"It doesn't look like Zainab's going to listen. But as Denise leaves, it's clear she's torn about what to do.\\" A short time before their wedding day arrives, Yusef starts to abuse Zainab both physically and mentally. He forbids Zainab to leave the house and later starts using her son, Kamil, to control her. Wadia explains that she wants the storyline to have a positive impact against real-life violence. She told BBC News :\\"I think the idea behind showing a strong woman like Zainab changing like this is to show that it can happen to even the strongest of women. They can change and they can be manipulated - especially if they're isolated from their friends and family. The manipulator can take advantage, so it's to prove that it can even happen to people like her. To be honest, if even one woman rings that Action Line at the end of the show and there's some difference made to her life, I'll feel like we've done our job,\\" she continued. \\"It is a serious issue and I'm glad it's being highlighted. I hope that it wakes anyone up - not just women, I know that there are abused men out there as well. So if it gives anyone the strength to leave a relationship like that, we'll have done our job.\\" The scenes where Yusef refused to let Zainab see Kamil pulled in 8.69m viewers at 7.30pm. BBC Three's repeat of the episode later secured 994k viewers at 10pm. Wadia admitted to feeling \\"emotionally drained\\" after her scenes with Ace Bhatti. She explained to The People: \\"It's very draining. I'm putting myself into this very dark place which I know sadly is a reality for so many women. Zainab's confidence has been steadily eroded. She's feeling isolated and has fallen under Yusef's control. He wants revenge. She is totally in his power. I had to show this can happen to any woman, no matter how strong she seems. Zainab was strong and not naive, but a woman is vulnerable if the man hits the right psychological weak spots. But both Ace and I have found it hard to do. I've known Ace for a long time and we're good friends. He has been wonderful to work with on this and very concerned about me all the way through.\\" Wadia has been given advice on the storyline from the Roshni refuge in Birmingham, which specializes in abuse within Asian families. Wadia warns that Yusef will ultimately get worse as time progresses. She said to Inside Soap: \\"I was filming out on location recently with Ace and a bunch of women came over to him and said, 'God, you're such a horrible man!' It's funny because Ace is such a sweet man - and you haven't even seen the worst of Yusef yet!\\" Wadia continued: \\"Let's just say that what happens is the complete opposite of what you want to see. Zainab and Yusef share a dark and twisted love, and she definitely has feelings for him. It's not true and pure like what she used to have with Masood - and if Yusef manages to get her back to Pakistan, it will be the end for her. I wouldn't be surprised if Zainab ends up in some sort of home to recover from everything that's going to happen.\\" Nitin Ganatra who plays Masood Ahmed explains to Digital Spy Masood's reactions when he discovers that Yusef has taken Kamil away. \\"Masood goes crazy over this!\\" Nitin replies. \\"I've got kids myself, and I know I'd react the same way if I found out that some other guy had taken my child to somebody's house who the child doesn't even know. Masood is still the only person who can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way.\\" Asked what Masood's reactions are over Zainab's abuse, Nitin says: \\"Masood tells Denise, 'It's just another one of Zainab's dramas', but then there comes a point where he sees bruises on Zainab. Then Masood becomes very concerned for Zainab in a very genuine way. It also might reignite something between the two of them as well, as they have to work together to solve these problems.\\" The scenes showing Masood and Denise race to the caf√© where Kamil was raised 8.26 million viewers. BBC Three's repeat screening later secured 781k viewers at 10pm. Reception In May 2011, Bhatti was nominated in the Best Newcomer category at the TV Quick Awards and the storyline where he tries to destroy the Masoods' marriage was nominated for Best Storyline. Bhatti was surprised to hear that Yusef is liked mainly by women, but in an interview with the Daily Mirror, he admits that he is nothing like Yusef in real life. BBC News branded Yusef as \\"Zainab's sinister first husband\\", elsewhere, Metro.co.uk described Yusef as a \\"deceptive doctor\\". Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror said that Zainab sending Yusef into the blazing building was a \\"stroke of genius\\". Simon also said that it's unknown what Yusef is hoping to achieve with his \\"one-man reign of terror. Being married to a woman he can‚Äôt stand, with a son he doesn‚Äôt want.\\" She added: \\"It doesn‚Äôt sound like much of a game-plan.\\" See also *List of EastEnders characters (2010) *List of fictional doctors *List of soap opera villains References External links * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2010 Category:Fictional physicians Category:Fictional Pakistani people Category:Fictional Islamic people Category:Fictional domestic abusers Category:Male villains Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Yusef Khan"},{"id":"29626539","text":"Dies rigorose Leben is a 1983 West German drama film directed by Vadim Glowna.

When the Massillon Rolling Mill Company merged into the Central Steel Company in June 1914, Griffiths resigned as a chemist at Canton's United Steel Company to become Central's vice president and superintendent. He then became the president of the company. His daughter, Gertrude, lit the first open hearth furnace at the new Central Steel Company in 1915. In 1917, Griffith's was named to the Massillon Steel Casting Company board of directors. The company's earliest orders came from the United States military for production of the steel-rated equipment and supplies needed for World War I. By 1919, 3 of his 5 brothers were all superintendents at Central Steel. In 1920, Griffiths was anticipated by many in Massillon, Ohio to purchase the Massillon Tigers, of the Ohio League and take the team into the new National Football League. However he never attended a meeting regarding the league or club and the Tigers soon folded. When Central Steel became part of Central Alloy Steel Company, Griffiths became chairman of its board of trustees.

Life and work Ren√© Br√¥ was born in Charenton outside Paris. After finishing his schooling in 1944 by the age of fourteen, he began study art at different art schools. Parallelly he supported himself as a commercial artist. In the late 1940s, he was a frequent visitor to Mus√©e de l'Homme and Louvre. He was in particularly attracted to primitive art and to the art of ancient Egypt. Br√¥'s works of this period - pottery, drawings and paintings ‚Äì are close to the works of Paul Klee or to that which Jean Dubuffet characterized as art brut.http://www.guggenheim- venice.it/inglese/collections/artisti/biografia.php?id_art=27 In 1949 Ren√© Br√¥ was exhibiting for the first time, at a joint exhibition in Paris. Afterwards he hitchhiked to Italy. During this trip he got to know the two years older Austrian painter Hundertwasser who was on the move too; they were to be lifelong friends. Soon after their return to France in 1950, they jointly grappled with mural painting on the walls of a pavilion of the family Dumage where Hundertwasser stayed in Saint-Mand√© outside Paris. Many years later, when this building was to be torn down in 1964, the two murals were saved from the demolition. One of them, La p√™che miraculeuse (The miraculous draught), is now in KunstHausWien, Hundertwasser's own museum in Vienna. The other wall, Paradis - Pays des hommes, oiseaux et navires (Paradise - Land of men, of trees, birds and ships) came to a synagogue on Long Island, New York, where it was removed in 2008.http://bro.perso.libertysurf.fr/Sommaire.htm These two friends went separate ways and got married, Br√¥ had children, and both were engaged in their own artistic projects, but they accompanied each other on trips throughout the years to North Africa, Mexico, India, Nepal, and Polynesia. In 1957 and for some years after they shared a studio in the old French village of Courgeron in the municipality of Le Pin-au-Haras, Lower Normandy, a location where Br√¥ at least went on visiting until his death. In 1954 Br√¥ had his first one-man exhibition in Paris. In 1964, he was invited to represent France at the Venice Biennial. In 1968 he set up a studio in Venice, where he later worked for a decade. He had many successful exhibitions around Europe and the world in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1984 he spent several months in Tahiti, where he had a show at the Mus√©e Gauguin. He returned two years later and then withdrew to his country house in the Norman Courgeron, dying at the age of 56.http://www.guggenheim- venice.it/inglese/collections/artisti/biografia.php?id_art=27 Footnotes External links * A French compilation of life and work * KunstHausWien Museum Hundertwasser Category:1986 deaths Category:French artists Category:1930 births Category:People from Charenton-le-Pont ","title":"Ren√© Br√¥"},{"id":"29626729","text":"The second season of Hawaii Five-O, an American television series, began September 24, 1969, and ended on March 11, 1970.
