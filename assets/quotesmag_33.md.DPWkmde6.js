The film premiered on CBS on November 28, 2010. It was presented through Hallmark Hall of Fame. It was shot in Nova Scotia. Plot A small Rhode Island community comes together to create special holiday (Halloween, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas) moments several weeks early for Vanessa Marks, an 8-year-old girl with a life- threatening illness. At the beginning of the film, Vanessa's father Tom (John Corbett) gives her a snow globe and inside that globe is another little girl holding a snow globe. Her mother Beth (Sarah Paulson) tells Vanessa that she has to shake the globe to make it snow. Vanessa is fascinated with the snow, having never seen it before, and wishes that she could see it for Christmas. Her father, hearing this, becomes concerned that Vanessa may not live to see December. After Tom quietly asks Jess Sanford, a neighboring farmer (Sam Elliott) about buying pumpkins - and later Christmas trees - the farmer figures out that the father is trying to speed up the holidays so that Vanessa will have the best Christmas before she dies. Jess, while searching for pumpkins to surprise the Marks family, heals an old friendship that he'd lost when his own son had passed away years ago, and is rewarded with an invitation to be his old friend's best man at the friend's upcoming wedding. Together, the two men sneak a truckload of pumpkins onto the family's front porch, much to the surprise of the daughter who decides she wants to have a Halloween party. The mother tries to explain that it's too early, but the father agrees to the party and Vanessa (and her younger brother) begin to plan their Halloween costumes. As a show of appreciation, Tom goes to the Jess's home and invites him and his wife to the party. Jess goes to town and mentions it to Tammy, a young waitress (Elizabeth McLaughlin) at the local restaurant whom Vanessa had befriended. Later, the farmer gives the father a box of Halloween decorations to help decorate the family's house, and on the night of the party the waitress arrives with all the town's children to help celebrate. Vanessa who was prohibited from going to school and meeting other children because of her illness is overjoyed at having so many playmates and friends. Jess, his wife, and his friend and his new wife follow carrying trays of food. Tammy tries her skills as a storyteller and tells a ghost story that makes the children scream and laugh. Together, Jess, his old friend, and Tammy help the family celebrate Halloween - and each holiday thereafter - a month early, and in doing so unite an entire community and teach everyone that what really matters in life is love. As Vanessa and her family return home one night from a particularly sorrowful hospital visit, they find that the neighbors have decorated their homes and streets with brilliant lights and holiday decorations a full month early. Jess, his friend, and the neighboring community line the family's driveway to greet Vanessa as she arrives home; her own house covered in beautiful lights. Everyone is invited inside the home to celebrate with food given by the town's local restaurant, and later, Vanessa runs outside with her snow globe just as an early snow begins to fall, duplicating the little girl inside the globe. Later, Tammy writes a children's book about Vanessa's life, with pictures that Vanessa had made herself during her illness. In the final scenes, a young woman (reading Tammy's book to children at the local library) explains that she is Vanessa, who is all grown- up and is now perfectly healthy; revealing that she had survived her illness after that early Christmas. Afterwards, she goes to the Jess's Christmas tree lot where she reunites with her family and Jess himself; to select the town's annual tree.

It was discovered during a March 1997 excavation before the land was to be mined for gravel and was part of the grave of a young man. Other objects in the grave, such as a hanging bowl and a pattern welded sword, suggest that it was the burial mound of a high-status warrior. The sparsely decorated nature of the helmet, a utilitarian iron fighting piece, belies its rarity. It is one of just six Anglo-Saxon helmets yet discovered, joined by finds from Benty Grange, Sutton Hoo, York, Shorwell and Staffordshire; its basic form is nearly identical to that of the richer Coppergate helmet found in York. Like these, the Pioneer Helmet is an example of the \\"crested helmets\\" that flourished in England and Scandinavia from the sixth through eleventh centuries. The distinctive feature of the helmet is the boar mounted atop its crest. Boar-crested helmets are a staple of Anglo-Saxon imagery, evidence of a Germanic tradition in which the boar invoked the protection of the gods. The Pioneer Helmet is one of three‚Äîtogether with the Benty Grange helmet and the detached Guilden Morden boar‚Äîknown to have survived. These boar crests recall a time when such decoration may have been common; the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, in which boar- adorned helmets are mentioned five times, speaks of a funeral pyre \\"heaped with boar-shaped helmets forged in gold,\\" forging a link between the warrior hero of legend and the Pioneer Helmet of reality. The helmet was named after Pioneer Aggregates UK Ltd, who funded its excavation and conservation. It was unveiled at the New Walk Museum in Leicester, and is on display at the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds. Description The basic construction of the richer Coppergate helmet is similar to that of the Pioneer Helmet. The helmet has the same basic form as the Anglo-Saxon Coppergate helmet, but is a utilitarian piece with little decoration, and is larger, perhaps to allow for additional padding. It originally consisted of an iron skull cap, from which hung two cheek guards. The form of neck protection that the helmet afforded, if any, is uncertain, owing to ploughing damage to the helmet. The cap of the helmet was constructed from twelve individual components riveted together. The basic form was created by four pieces: a brow band joined by a nose-to-nape band, and, on either side, a lateral band reaching from the side of the brow band to the top of the nose-to-nape band. Cutouts at the front of the brow and nose-to-nape bands functioned as eye-holes, and a wide strip of metal was riveted along the edge of the openings, perhaps to provide balance or decoration. Four subtriangular infill plates were riveted inside to cover the resulting holes. Finally, three narrow C-sectioned strips were added to provide additional strength, one each running the length of the nose-to-nape and lateral bands. The nasal is not a separate component, but rather is a continuation of the nose-to-nape bands. Atop the helmet was set the boar. It was affixed to the C-sectioned nose-to-nape strip, and was forged from a single rod of iron. Its back was bent downwards to form the hind legs, while the front of the rod was split, one part bent to form the forelegs, the other part continuing forward to form the boar's snout. Beyond very minor details‚Äîthe snout was made to be slightly triangular, the hind was somewhat flattened, and slight grooves in the forelegs suggested individual limbs‚Äîthe boar was not decorated. Beneath the cap hung two cheek guards. The sinister cheek guard, which is all that remains other than minor fragments of the dexter, was long and wide at the top. It was curved inward both laterally and longitudinally other than the upper rear edge which was bent outwards, either intentionally to improve the articulation of the joint, or by damage incurred during use. Two strips of metal were then bent in half, with one folded around the brow band and one around the cheek guard, and attached by a single rivet through each. These encased a narrow loop of wire which held the cheek guards to the cap. A single rivet was also attached to the middle of the guard, probably to facilitate the attachment of leather strips used to draw tight the cheek guards. The form of neck protection on the helmet, if any, is unclear. The bottom of the back of the helmet is largely missing, although the portion that survives appears to have at least two perforations. These would most likely have been used to attach a neck guard, perhaps like the one made of camail on the Coppergate helmet, yet no such remains were found. A series of unexplained iron rods found near the helmet could theoretically have been used as stiffeners for an organic neck guard, such as one made of leather, but such an arrangement has no known parallels; it is instead thought that the rods were more likely belt stiffeners. Discovery The helmet was discovered over Easter in March 1997 in Wollaston, near Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. Excavations in the area had taken place for years on behalf of various aggregate companies before the land was exploited for gravel, and had uncovered an extensive network of Iron Age and Roman farms. The evidence for post-Roman habitation, however, had been limited to two fragments of a brooch, and two separate collections of pottery, when metal detector surveying discovered a copper alloy hanging bowl and a millefiori-decorated mount in what turned out to be a grave. The hanging bowl was detected by Steve Critchley, working alongside the archaeologist Ian Meadows. Meadows immediately recognised the bowl for what it was, and began an excavation. The grave was in the shape of an elongated oval long and wide, and may have originally been a tumulus. It was only from a main contemporary roadway and was likely intended to have been seen by those passing by. Owing to ensuing years of cultivation and ploughing of the fields, the grave was only deep when excavated. Various artefacts were therefore damaged, and any originally placed higher in the grave, such as a shield or spearheads, may have been completely destroyed. The grave was excavated with brushes and wooden tools, revealing a number of bone fragments, including part of a skull; these were used to suggest that the body was that of a man seventeen to twenty-five years old, laid in a supine position with his head on a pillow and knees slightly raised. Also found were three iron buckles, a small iron knife, a small copper alloy hook, and a series of iron rods of unknown function. A pattern welded sword was also found, and together with the hanging bowl and helmet, marks the grave as one for a person of high social status. The helmet lay next to where the left hip of the body would have rested. It was on its sinister side, with almost the entirety of the dexter side lost through ploughing. Prior to its deposition the nasal had been bent inwards, fracturing the metal, perhaps in a \\"ritual killing\\" of the object; a custom known to many cultures, including Anglo-Saxons and Vikings, the practice involves the deliberate breaking of objects before burial for reasons ranging from the releasing of an object's spirit, to the deterrence of grave robbing. When found it was at first thought to be a bucket. Archaeologists covered it in cling film, then wrapped it in plaster of Paris bandages and raised it in a soil block. This was taken to the conservation laboratory at the Newarke Houses Museum in Leicester, where it was analysed, and later conserved, by Anthony \\"Rolly\\" Read. The plaster- covered soil block was first x-rayed, revealing the boar-crested helmet within. The remaining half of the helmet was broken into many pieces‚Äîbetween 100 and 200 overall‚Äîincluding some which were deposited within the helmet itself. These fragments were reassembled using the cellulose nitrate adhesive HMG; the surviving cheek guard, alone, was reassembled from eighteen fragments. The helmet was then dried out and taken to the Leicester General Hospital, where it was subjected to digital x-rays and CT scans. Using this information it was then cleaned, and samples of organic materials‚Äîprincipally textiles and leather, perhaps from the helmet's lining, as well as possible feathers on the brow band‚Äîwere taken. It was then reassembled into seven larger parts, cleaned again, and finally reconstructed into one piece. Missing sections within the remaining half were then filled in and painted, and in the last step, the boar was affixed to the apex using epoxy. Newspapers as far away as Australia and New Zealand published accounts of the discovery in April, hailing it as \\"the find of the decade\\". The helmet was placed on public display on 23 December 1997. The Wollaston burial was on private land owned by Peter Gammidge and John Minney, and the helmet is now owned by Gammidge and the family of the late Minney. It was termed the \\"Pioneer Helmet\\" after Pioneer Aggregates UK Ltd (now owned by Hanson), who fully funded the conservation, and who had over time spent more than ¬£400,000 funding archaeology in the area. The helmet was displayed until March 1998 at the New Walk Museum in Leicester, the site of its unveiling. Currently it is on display at the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Typology The Pioneer Helmet is dated to the late seventh century on the basis of the style of belt buckles found in the grave, which were current around 675. This suggests a terminus post quem (earliest possible date) for the burial, although not necessarily the helmet's exact date of manufacture or deposition. It is of Anglo-Saxon origin, one of only six such helmets known along with those from Benty Grange, Sutton Hoo, York, Shorwell, and Staffordshire. Like these examples‚Äîwith the exception of the Frankish Shorwell helmet‚Äîthe Pioneer Helmet is broadly classed as one of the \\"crested helmets\\" known in Northern Europe in the sixth through eleventh centuries AD. These are each characterised by a rounded cap and usually a prominent nose-to-nape crest. Except for an outlier fragment found in Kiev, all crested helmets originate from England or Scandinavia, and are distinct from the continental spangenhelm and lamellenhelm from the same period. Iconography A Central European boar The boar was an important symbol in prehistoric Europe, where, according to the archaeologist Jennifer Foster, it was \\"venerated, eulogised, hunted and eaten ... for millennia, until its virtual extinction in recent historical time.\\" Anglo-Saxon boar symbols follow a thousand years of similar iconography, coming after La T√®ne examples in the fourth century BC, Gaulish specimens three centuries later, and Roman boars in the fourth century AD. They likely represent a fused tradition of European and Mediterranean cultures. The boar is said to have been sacred to a mother goddess figure among linguistically Celtic communities in Iron Age Europe, while the Roman historian Tacitus, writing around the first century AD, suggested that the Baltic Aesti wore boar symbols in battle to invoke her protection. Boar- crested helmets are depicted on the turn-of-the-millennium Gundestrup cauldron, discovered in Denmark, and on a Torslunda plate from Sweden, made some 500 years later. Though the Romans also included the boar in their stable of symbols‚Äîfour legions, including the twentieth, adopted it as their emblem‚Äîit was only one among many. The boar persisted in continental Germanic tradition during the nearly 400 years of Roman rule in Britain, such as in association with the Scandinavian gods Freyja and Freyr. Its return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period, as represented by the boars from Benty Grange, Wollaston, Guilden Morden, and Horncastle, may therefore suggest the post-Roman reintroduction of a Germanic tradition from Europe, rather than the continuation of a tradition in Britain through 400 years of Roman rule. Whatever its precise symbolism, the Anglo-Saxon boar appears to have been associated with protection; the Beowulf poet makes this clear, writing that boar symbols on helmets kept watch over the warriors wearing them. =Boar- crests in Beowulf= The Benty Grange helmet The boar-crested Pioneer Helmet recalls the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, in which helmets with boar imagery are referenced five times. In three cases they appear to feature freestanding boars atop the helmets, like the Wollaston example. Such is the case after Grendel is defeated, when a minstrel entertains Beowulf and his men with the story of the Fight at Finnsburh, in which Hn√¶f, king of the Danes, died. In another case, Hrothgar laments the death of √Üschere, \\"my right-hand man when the ranks clashed and our boar-crests had to take a battering in the line of action\\" (').

Growing up to 8 metres tall, it is found in rainforest margins and in wet eucalyptus forests. Description Androcalva fraseri is a shrub that typically grows to a height of shrub, or a small tree to high. Arranged alternately along the stems, the ovate leaves have irregularly toothed margins and are long and wide. The leaf undersides are whitish, and covered in a fine fur. Flowering peaks in September and continues till November. The small white flowers are arranged in clusters. Flowering is followed by the development of fruit, long. Taxonomy The French naturalist Jacques Etienne Gay was the first to formally describe the species in 1823. He gave it the name Commersonia fraseri and published the description in the journal, M√©moires du Mus√©um d'Histoire Naturelle. A 2011 molecular analysis of segments of chloroplast DNA found that the genera Commersonia and Rulingia formed a monophyletic group but that the member species were intermingled, and split out into two hitherto unrecognised clades. In 2011, Carolyn Wilkins and Barbara Whitlock changed the name to Androcalva fraseri. The specific epithet honours Charles Fraser, an early New South Wales colonial botanist. Vernacular names include brush kurrajong and blackfellows hemp. Distribution and habitat Flowering, Sylvan Grove Native Garden Androcalva fraseri is found in rainforest and wet eucalypt forest along and east of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. In the latter habitat, it is associated with trees such as rough-barked apple (Angophora floribunda), turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), and Sydney blue gum (Eucalyptus saligna). A fast-growing plant, it is able to colonise disturbed ground, particularly areas where vegetation has been partly cleared such as under power lines. It is an adult host plant for the chrysomelid beetle Podagra submetallica. Use in horticulture Androcalva fraseri has been propagated readily from cuttings taken in winter, and grows better with extra moisture in cultivation.

Muller, Review: How was metazoan threshold crossed? The hypothetical Urmetazoa. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A 129, 433 (2001). These living fossils are ideal for studying the principal features of metazoans, such as extracellular matrix interactions, signal-receptor systems, nervous or sensory systems, and primitive immune systems. Thus, sponges are useful tools with which to study early animal evolution. They appeared approximately 580 million years ago.

FEMS Microbiology Ecology 85, 465 (2013). Due to Suberites‚Äô ability to efficiently filter water, many microbes, especially fungal species, are filtered through. If these microbes escape digestion, they can deposit on the sponge and reside there indefinitely. Symbiotic bacteria produce toxins, such as okadaic acid, which defend them from colonization by parasitic annelids.H. C.

M√ºller et al., Oxygen-Controlled Bacterial Growth in the Sponge Suberites domuncula: toward a Molecular Understanding of the Symbiotic Relationships between Sponge and Bacteria. Applied & Environmental Microbiology 70, 2332 (2004). Expression of various enzymes by Suberites influences the growth of their symbiotic bacteria. Suberites often live on the shells on the mollusk Hexaplex trunculus. Suberites have mechanisms of defense against predation, such as the toxic chemicals found below.W. E. G. M√ºller et al., Molecular/chemical ecology in sponges: evidence for an adaptive antibacterial response in Suberites domuncula. Marine Biology 144, 19 (2004).

M√ºller et al., Matrix-mediated canal formation in primmorphs from the sponge Suberites domuncula involves the expression of a CD36 receptor-ligand system. Journal of Cell Science 117, 2579 (2004). However, they do have many of the same receptors and signals found in higher animals.X. Wang, X. Fan, H. Schr√∂der, W. M√ºller, Flashing light in sponges through their siliceous fiber network: A new strategy of 'neuronal transmission' in animals. Chinese Science Bulletin 57, 3300 (2012). Researchers in China and Germany have found that sponge spicules contribute to their neural communication.W. E. G. M√ºller et al., Luciferase a light source for the silica-based optical waveguides (spicules) in the demosponge Suberites domuncula. Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences 66, 537 (2009). In effect, the siliaceous structures act as fiber optic cables to convey light signals generated from the protein luciferase. The sponges generate light from luciferin, after it is acted upon by luciferase.W. E. G. M√ºller et al., A cryptochrome-based photosensory system in the siliceous sponge Suberites domuncula (Demospongiae). FEBS Journal 277, 1182 (2010). Suberites have also been shown to produce light in response to tactile stimulation. Suberites consist mostly of cells, in contrast with other Porifera (such as the class Hexactinellida) which are syncytial. As a result, Suberites have slower reaction times in their neural communication. Suberites utilized many Ras-like GTPases which are used for signaling and affect development.H. Cetkovic, A. Mikoc, W. E. G. M√ºller, V. Gamulin, Ras-like Small GTPases Form a Large Family of Proteins in the Marine Sponge Suberites domuncula. Journal of Molecular Evolution 64, 332 (2007). According to comparative studies, Suberites have some of the most simple indicator proteins, such as collagen, of known animals. Like all sponges, Suberites are filter-feeders. They are extremely efficient and can process thousands of liters of water per day.M. Wiens et al., Innate Immune Defense of the Sponge Suberites domuncula against Bacteria Involves a MyD88-dependent Signaling Pathway. Journal of Biological Chemistry 280, 27949 (2005). S. domuncula has been used for study of graft rejection. Researchers have discovered that apoptotic factors are induced in the tissue that is rejected.M. Wiens, S. Perovic-Ottstadt, I. M. M√ºller, W. E. G. M√ºller, Allograft rejection in the mixed cell reaction system of the demospongeSuberites domunculais controlled by differential expression of apoptotic genes. Immunogenetics 56, 597 (2004). Development Suberites consist of many telomerase-positive cells, which means the cells are essentially immortal, barring cell death signal. In most cases, the signal is a lack of connection either to the extracellular matrix or other cells. Their apoptotic cells are similar to homologous to mammalian. However, maintenance of long-lived cells involves proteins such as SDLAGL that are highly similar to yeast and human homologs. Certain inorganic materials, such as iron and selenium, influence the growth of Suberites, including the primmorph growth and spicule formation.L. Valisano, G. Bavestrello, M. Giovine, A. Arillo, C. Cerrano, Effect of iron and dissolved silica on primmorphs of Petrosia ficiformis (Poiret, 1789). Chemistry & Ecology 23, 233 (2007).A.

Schr√∂der et al., Differentiation capacity of epithelial cells in the sponge Suberites domuncula. Cell & Tissue Research 316, 271 (2004). Morphology Suberites are key examples of the importance of the extracellular matrix in animals. In sponges, it is mediated by proteoglycans. Spicule formation is also important for Suberites. Spicules are structural support of sponges, similar to skeletons in higher animals. They are normally hollow structures that are formed by lamellar growth.H. C.

Cell & Tissue Research 339, 429 (2010). Whereas higher animal skeletons are largely calcium-based, sponge spicules consist mostly of silica, a silicon dioxide polymer.W. Xiaohong et al., Evagination of Cells Controls Bio-Silica Formation and Maturation during Spicule Formation in Sponges. PLoS ONE 6, 1 (2011). These inorganic structures provide support for the animals.X. Wang et al., Silicateins, silicatein interactors and cellular interplay in sponge skeletogenesis: formation of glass fiber-like spicules. FEBS Journal 279, 1721 (2012). The spicules are biologically-formed silica structures, also known as biosilica.W. E. G. M√ºller et al., Hardening of bio-silica in sponge spicules involves an aging process after its enzymatic polycondensation: Evidence for an aquaporin-mediated water absorption. BBA ‚àí General Subjects 1810, 713 (2011).W. E. G. M√ºller et al., Silicateins, the major biosilica forming enzymes present in demosponges: Protein analysis and phylogenetic relationship. Gene 395, 62 (2007). Silica deposition begins intracellularly and is carried out by the enzyme silicatein.W. E. G. M√ºller et al., Identification of a silicatein(-related) protease in the giant spicules of the deep-sea hexactinellid Monorhaphis chuni. Journal of Experimental Biology 211, 300 (2008) Silicateins are modulated by a group of proteins called silintaphins.W. E. G. M√ºller et al., The silicatein propeptide acts as inhibitor/modulator of self-organization during spicule axial filament formation. FEBS Journal 280, 1693 (2013). The process occurs in specialized cells known as sclerocytes. Biosilica formation in Suberites differs from other species that utilize biosilica in this regard. Most other species, such as certain plants and diatoms, simply deposit a supersatured biosilica solution. The network of silica found in sponges mediates much of the sponges‚Äô neural communications. Immunity and defense Suberites show the cytokine-like molecule allograft inflammatory factor one (AIF-1), which is similar to vertebrate AIF-1.H. C. Schr√∂der et al., Functional Molecular Biodiversity: Assessing the Immune Status of Two Sponge Populations ( Suberites domuncula) on the Molecular Level. Marine Ecology 25, 93 (2004). Immune response relies on phosphorylation cascades involving the p38 kinase. S. domuncula was the first demonstrated immune response of invertebrate species (1). These sponges also have similar graft-response inflammation to vertebrates. Their immune systems are much simpler than vertebrates; they consist of only innate immunity. Because they filter thousands of liters of water per day, and their environment contains a high concentration of bacteria and viruses, Suberites have developed a highly potent system of immunity. Despite the efficiency of their immune systems, Suberites can be susceptible to infection which often stimulates cell death through apoptotic pathways. Suberites, namely S. domuncula, defend themselves from macroscopic threats with a neurotoxin known as suberitine.L. Cariello, L. Zanetti, Suberitine, the toxic protein from the marine spong suberites domuncula. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology 64C, 15 (1979). It was the first known protein discovered in a sponge. The neurotoxic properties of suberitine arise from its ability to block action potentials.L. Cariello, E. Tosti, L. Zanetti, The hemolytic activity of suberitine. Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology 73C, 91 (1981). It additionally has hemolytic properties, which do not originate from phospholipase A activity. It has some antibacterial activity; however, the extent of the activity due solely to suberitine is not currently defined.N. L. Thakur et al., Antibacterial activity of the sponge suberites domuncula and its primmorphs: potential basis for epibacterial chemical defense. Aquatic Microbial Ecology 31, 77 (2003). The sponge itself neutralizes the toxin through a pathway that is not fully understood, but involves retinal, a Œ≤-carotene metabolite.W. Muller et al., Differential expression of the desmosponge (suberites domuncula) carotenoid oxygenases in response to light: protection mechanism against the self- produced toxic protein (suberitine). Marine Drugs 10, 177 (2012). S. japonicas also produces several cytotoxic compounds, seragamides A-F. The seragamides act by interfering with cytoskeleton activity, specifically the actin microfilaments. The activity of the seragamides is a possible route for anti- cancer drugs, similar to existing drugs which target microtubules.

UAPs also provide bedside care‚Äîincluding basic nursing procedures‚Äîall under the supervision of a registered nurse, licensed practical nurse or other health care professional. UAPs must demonstrate their ability and competence before gaining any expanded responsibilities in a clinical setting. While providing this care, UAPs offer compassion and patience and are part of the patient's healthcare support system. Communication between UAPs and registered nurses (RNs) is key as they are working together in their patients' best interests. The scope of care UAPs are responsible for is delegated by RNs or other clinical licensed professionals. UAPs care for patients in hospitals, residents of nursing facilities, clients in private homes, and others in need of their services due to old age or disability. By definition, UAPs do not hold a license or other mandatory professional requirements for practice, though many hold various certifications. They are collectively categorized under the group \\"personal care workers in health services\\" in the International Standard Classification of Occupations, 2008 revision.  Scope of care  The responsibilities and duties of a UAP include: * Observing, documenting and reporting clinical and treatment information, including patients' behavioral changes * Assisting with motion exercises and other rehabilitative measures * Taking and recording blood pressure, temperature, pulse, respiration, and body weight * Assisting with ambulation and mobilization of patients * Collecting specimens for required medical tests, * Providing emotional and support services to patients, their families and other caregivers * Assisting with personal hygiene: bathing, oral hygiene, nail care, and grooming * Assisting with dressing, repositioning, feeding, and toileting Most UAPs, including nursing assistants, are not certified to change sterile dressings, distribute medications, insert or remove any tubing, or conduct tube feedings. Such tasks should be therefore left to the overseeing nurse or clinical licensed professional. UAPs must be delegated responsibilities. The nurses are ultimately accountable for all the care patients receive as a result of their delegating. Due to the nursing shortage and to reduce the heavy workload placed on nurses, delegating tasks to UAPs is crucial.  Types and training  Nursing assistant, nursing auxiliary, auxiliary nurse, patient care technician, home health aide/assistant, geriatric aide/assistant, psychiatric aide, nurse aide, and nurse tech are all common titles for UAPs. There are some differences in scope of care across UAPs based on title and description. Unlicensed assistive personnel are important members of the health care team who often hold a high level of experience and ability. While they do not require extensive health care training to practice their profession, manual dexterity and good interpersonal communication skills are usually necessary. They often undergo some formal education, apprenticeship or on-the-job training in areas such as body mechanics, nutrition, anatomy and physiology, cognitive impairments and mental health issues, infection control, personal care skills, and record-keeping.World Health Organization. Classifying health workers: mapping occupations to the international standard classification. Geneva, WHO, 2010.U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition ‚Äì Nursing and Psychiatric Aides. Accessed 12 April 2011.National Association of Career Colleges. Personal Support Worker. Accessed 12 April 2011. Training for UAPs is available from various outlets such as: * Home health care agencies * Community colleges * Vocational schools * Eldercare programs * On-the-job training = Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) = The National Association of Health Care Assistants defines the role of CNAs as: \\"In the United States, certified nursing assistants typically work in a nursing home or hospital and perform everyday living tasks for the elderly, chronically sick, or rehabilitation patients who cannot care for themselves.\\" Many community colleges offer CNA training in one semester. Other educational programs offer accelerated programs. In some cases, Skilled Nursing Facilities will pay for a CNA course for their employees. CNA certification requirements vary by state. The requirements generally include: * Complete an accredited CNA course * Pass the state's CNA exam, consisting of written and practical portions * Register as a CNA within the state * Acquire a minimum number of hours of supervised on-duty experience Once these requirements are completed, the person will be certified in their state. Moving to a different state requires recertification in the new state unless both states use the NNAAP standard.National Council of State Boards of Nursing. \\"NNAAP Testing Standard\\". Accessed 16 March 2014. In that case, the new state accepts previous NNAAP test scores and allows registration. These certification exams are distributed by the state. Classes to study for these exams are provided by the American Red Cross as well as other providers. The Red Cross courses encompass everything in the state exams, from communication to health terms to sensitivity.National Certified Nurse Assistant Resource \\"CNA Resource\\". Accessed 11 March 2014. In the United States, CNAs must work a minimum number of hours every two years as specified by the state and have no records of abuse or neglect to keep their certification. Each state also has its own mandatory continuing education hours that CNAs must fulfill. Similar titles in the United Kingdom and elsewhere include healthcare assistant, healthcare support worker, or clinical support worker. These providers usually work in hospitals or community settings under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.National Health Service. NHS Careers in Detail: Healthcare assistants/auxiliary nurses. Accessed 12 April 2011. In the United Kingdom, the Care Certificate was introduced in April 2015, following the Cavendish Review of April 2013 into standards of care among health care assistants and support workers in the NHS and social care settings. The purpose of the Care Certificate is to address inconsistencies in training and competencies in the workforce so that all staff have the same introductory skills, knowledge and behaviours to provide safe, high quality and compassionate care of the highest standards. The Care Certificate was jointly developed by Skills for Health, Health Education England and Skills for Care. = Home Health Aide (HHA) = A home health aide (HHA) provides in-home care for patients who need assistance with daily living beyond what family or friends can provide. Patients include those who have a physical or mental disability, are recovering from an injury or surgery, have a chronic illness, or are advanced in age. Training requirements to become an HHA are generally minimal and vary by state.Home Health Aide training \\"How to Get Home Health Aide Training\\". Accessed 16 March 2014. = Personal Support Worker (PSW) = Personal support worker (PSW) is the title for a similar type of health worker in Ontario, Canada. Personal support work is unique among health care professions in that the scope of a PSW's duties does not extend beyond what the client could do him/herself if the client were physically and cognitively able.PSW Courses in Toronto & Etobicoke, Canadian College of Healthcare & Pharmaceutics No other profession's scope is similarly described. In May 2011, Ontario's Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) announced the creation of a Registry of Personal Support Workers to acknowledge the care it provides daily to some of Ontario's most vulnerable populations, including seniors and people with chronic illnesses and disabilities. The Ontario PSW Registry was launched on June 1, 2012, and now has over 23,000 registered PSWs. = Surgical Technologist = Surgical technologists are considered UAPs in the US, where they are also sometimes called \\"scrub tech\\". The title can mean different things in other countries. In Mozambique, for example, surgical technologists are medical professionals trained and registered to perform advanced clinical procedures including emergency surgery.Cumbi A et al. \\"Major surgery delegation to mid-level health practitioners in Mozambique: health professionals' perceptions.\\" Human Resources for Health; 2007, 5:27 = Birth Assistant = Birth assistants, such as doulas, childbirth educators and other persons providing emotional support and general care and advice to women and families during pregnancy and childbirth, are also typically considered UAPs. They are distinguished from midwives, physicians, nurses, and other professionals who are trained and licensed to provide basic and emergency pregnancy and childbirth-related health care services and manage complications.  Practice  In the context of aging populations and health care reform, UAPs are in growing demand in many countries. But without formal qualifications, UAPs are often unable to perform some tasks due to issues of liability and legality. Some places have made attempts to regulate, control, and verify education. This allows an employer to verify experience and knowledge as well as assist in preventing individuals who have been \\"struck\\" (had registration/certification invalidated) from continuing to work in healthcare roles. In the UK, for example, the credibility of the Healthcare Assistant and other social care workers is intended to be strengthened by their compulsory registration from 2009 with the General Social Care Council in England or its Scottish or Welsh equivalents. In the United States, families and employers can verify a UAP's certification by checking the state's nursing registry. Each state is required to maintain an updated nursing registry under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA). The registry details valid certifications and reports of abuse or neglect. The background information these registries provide is important in protecting patients.  Turnover and job stability  Typically, the turnover rate among an organization's UAPs is very high, which can be detrimental to patients' quality of care and cause stress and dissatisfaction among the personnel.Cohen-Mansfield, Jiska. \\"Turnover among nursing home staff: A review.\\" Nursing management 28.5 (1997): 59-64. Studies exploring the reasons for turnover show that it is not just a matter of pay, but can have many causes, such as the degree of respect the unlicensed personnel receive, the stress level, physical demands, scheduling flexibility, and their commitment to the profession.Kupperschmidt. B.R. (2002). Unlicensed assistive personnel retention and realistic job previews. Nursing Economics, 20, 279-283. UAPs need coping strategies, outlets, and a support system to deal with problems on the job such as difficult patients and grueling tasks.

Women‚Äôs Concerns. Retrieved 14 November 2010. Common challenges for all refugee women, regardless of other demographic data, are access to healthcare and physical abuse and instances of discrimination, sexual violence, and human trafficking are the most common ones. But even if women don't become victims of such actions, they often face abuse and disregard for their specific needs and experiences, which leads to complex consequences including demoralization, stigmatization, and mental and physical health decay.International Rescue Committee. The Forgotten Frontline: The Effects of War on Women. Retrieved 14 November 2010. The lack of access to appropriate resources from international humanitarian aid organizations is compounded by the prevailing gender assumptions around the world, though recent shifts in gender mainstreaming are aiming to combat these commonalities. Refugee Women in Chad Health Health clinic inside of a refugee camp Health issues faced by refugee women range from dehydration and diarrhea, to high fevers and malaria. They also include more broad reaching phenomena, such as gender-based violence and maternal health. The leading causes of death to refugee women include malnutrition, diarrhea, respiratory infections, and reproductive complications. Health concerns of refugee women are influenced by a variety of factors including their physical, mental, and social wellbeing. Health complications and concerns for refugee women are prevalent both during their time as refugees living in transient camps or shelters, as well as once they relocate to countries of asylum or resettlement. External factors contributing to the health concerns of refugee women include culturally-reinforced gender inequality, limited mobility, lack of access to healthcare facilities, high population density within the refugee camps, and low levels of education. = Reproductive health = International humanitarian aid organizations, such as the United Nations, agree that adequate reproductive care must be \\"safe, effective...[and] affordable.\\" According to the United Nations, while universal values in human rights support the availability of reproductive health care needs of all women, services that conform to adequate standards while respecting cultural differences are rarely provided to refugee women. Due to the lack of satisfactory reproductive health care in refugee camps, complications related to child delivery and pregnancy was one of the leading cause of both death and illness among refugee women living in transitory camps in 2010. Refugee women who have left humanitarian aid camps and have moved permanently to countries of asylum and resettlement also face reproductive health challenges. A study published in 2004 by the Journal of Midwifery and Women's Health found that refugee women living in wealthy nations face troubles in accessing appropriate reproductive care due to stereotyping, language barriers, and lack of cultural respect and understanding. = Mental health = Refugee women often face a host of mental health complications in their home countries, in refugee camps, and in countries of resettlement or asylum. In their native countries, women who have fled as refugees may have been psychosocially or physically abused for a variety of reasons, including genocide; an attempted shaming of a family, community, or culture; or for being seen as \\" politically dangerous.\\" These forms of abuse often lead to exile or fleeing, and have the propensity to cause distress and detrimental harm to the mental health and wellbeing of refugee women. In refugee camps, the mental health of refugee women is also affected by incidences of discrimination based on gender, sexual and domestic violence, forced labor, and heavy responsibilities. In countries of asylum and resettlement, complications with mental health also prevail due to language and cultural barriers, the post traumatic stress of fleeing persecution in their home countries, difficulty seeking mental health treatment, and an increased likelihood of facing abuse as compared to host-country nationals. = Nutrition = Malnutrition of refugee women manifests in a variety of ways both in refugee camps and in countries of asylum and resettlement. Issues of food security, economic and political misunderstanding, and discrimination within refugee camps contribute to the poor nutrition and health of many refugee women. In a study of food aid in Rwandan refugee camps, experts found that international aid agencies' lack of consideration and attention to the political, economic, and cultural workings of countries in crises can lead to inadequate and inappropriate food aid, which in turn may result in malnutrition for refugees. Likewise, studies have shown that despite no legal distinction between male and female refugees, international refugee communities and even aid organizations tend to uphold discrimination based on gender. This translates into disproportionate malnutrition for refugee women through lack of priority in food distribution as well as medical attention for nutrition-related issues and lack of reproductive nutritional care. South Sudanese refugees being served food. Many of them complain of hunger due to the food rationing by World Food Program Issues of malnutrition persist in countries of asylum and resettlement for refugee women though mechanisms of food insecurity and lack of nutritional education. A study on Somali refugee women in 2013 found that rates of meat and egg intake were significantly higher in refugee women than comparable populations of host-country national women, while rates of fruit and vegetable intake were significantly lower. A related study of Cambodian refugee women found that common reasons for poor nutritional intake were living in food insecure, low-income areas, lack of economic means to purchase nutritious food, and lack of education about nutritious eating in their new country of residence. Labor Refugee women are often subjected to forced labor in refugee camps through the reinforcement of traditional gender roles and stereotypes. Women in refugee camps are often the primary sources of physical labor for water collection and filtration, as well as small gardening and agricultural tasks and food preparation. Also as Despite their large roles in these areas, women are excluded from leadership on committees and planning parties within refugee camps and are relegated to strictly laborious roles. Meanwhile, male refugees are frequently seen in positions of influence and power within the camp and among international aid agencies. Refugee women in transitory camps are also frequently subjected to forced labor, encompassing both forced prostitution and forced physical labor. In addition to violating the legal rights of refugees, forced labor experienced by women in refugee camps has been found to be detrimental to their physical, mental, and social well-being. Often, women subjected to these and other forced labors are sought out on the basis of their race and stereotyped low position in society.  Assault  According to the United Nations, gender based violence in the context of assault against refugee women is \\"any act of violence that results in...physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering to women including threats..coercion, or arbitrary deprivation of liberty.\\" Assault on refugee women is both sexual and non-sexual, although instances of violence manifest most often in the form of sexual violence for refugee women. According to a 2000 study, women are particularly vulnerable to rape and other forms of sexual assault in times of war and \\"disintegration of social structures\\" for a variety of reasons. These reasons include social unrest, the mingling of diverse cultures and values, prevalent power dynamics, and the vulnerability of women seeking refuge. Ways in which violence and sexual assault manifest themselves against refugee women include forced prostitution or coerced sex by international aid agency workers / volunteers, forced prostitution or coerced sex by fellow members of the refugee camp, forced prostitution or coerced sex by local community members, rape by any of the above demographics, exchange of sex for vital material goods or services, or an attempt to dishonor a woman, her husband, or her father. Sexual violence is considered a taboo subject in many cultures, and therefore gender-based violence often goes unreported as well. Even if women did seek to report violence, often there is nowhere within the refugee camp for them to turn. Humanitarian assistance Numerous Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and intergovernmental organizations work to advocate on behalf of refugee women and children. In 1989, the first efforts towards gender specific aid for refugees was published in United Nations High Commission on Refugee manuals. The first initiatives of gender mainstreaming in refugee aid were developed in response to the refugee crises of Guatemala, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Rwanda. Since that time, the concept of gender mainstreaming has gained traction in a variety of refugee aid initiatives, yet experts believe that there are gaps between the policies they outline and the experience of refugee women. Studies by Doreen Indra found that while there are many institutions providing humanitarian aid to refugee women, it may not reach its full potential due to a lack of refugee input in the programming and policies meant to provide them assistance. When refugee women are excluded from the development process of humanitarian assistance, it was found that policies are often made rooted in traditional gender assumptions, thereby reinforcing traditional and sometimes harmful gender roles in refugee camps. A review by Linda Cipriano revealed that another barrier in executing effective aid for refugee women is that women are disproportionately denied status as a refugee, which in turn acts as a barrier to receiving the assistance they need. Since its inception, the universal definition for a refugee as described by the United Nations is a person with a ‚Äúwell-founded fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, or political opinion.‚Äù Under this definition, persecution on the basis of gender and sexual violence are not protected. Many countries abide by this strict language and deny women access to services of declared refugees on these grounds. The International Rescue Committee serves as an advocate for women to foreign governments to pass laws concerning the health and well-being of refugee women. They also educate men and boys to change the culture of violence towards women.International Rescue Committee. The IRC at a Glance. Retrieved 14 November 2010.

On 1 November 1969, a newspaper called The Battle Banner began to appear in Alma-Ata. Since each district at that time had its own printed organ, the Central Asian Military District had direct control over the newspaper. In May 1989, the publication was discontinued due to the abolition of the district, and the editorial office was disbanded. Between 1989 and 1992, the Armed Forces explored the idea of recreating a newspaper.

Stadium Facilities In 2010, The ACT Government invested $1.4 million into the complex to bring it up to ABL standards in order for the Canberra Cavalry to be established and compete in the league. Guideline ACT was appointed the construction company that oversaw the redevelopment, the company won an award for their work on the ballpark in 2011. Narrabundah Ballpark complex consists of three fields. The primary field at The Fort is used by the Canberra Cavalry in the ABL and its dimensions are L:101m x C:120m x R:101m. The field has full-size dugouts, broadcast standard lighting, a roofed grandstand with additional bleacher seating, drought- tolerant turf, state of the art irrigation system, electronic scoreboard and player safety padding. Field two has a full diamond and field lighting sufficient for domestic use. Field three also has a full diamond but does not have lights. In 2012, ACT Labor made an election promise to spend an additional $5 million on further upgrades to the ballpark if re-elected. Under the proposal the money would be spent over three years between 2014-17. The upgrade would include a new grandstand, improved player and public amenities, improved concession and retail outlet, realignment of the field along the first and third base lines and improvements to public access and car parking.

The Swinomish Channel is the smallest of the three entrances to Puget Sound‚Äîthe other two being Deception Pass and Admiralty Inlet. The Swinomish Channel is partly natural and partly dredged. Before being dredged, it was a collection of shallow tidal sloughs, salt marshes, and mudflats known as Swinomish Slough. The United States Army Corps of Engineers used dredging and diking to create a navigable channel, completed in 1937 during the Great Depression. The channel is heavily used by fishing boats, tugs, recreational craft, and shallow-draft freight vessels. To maintain navigable depths, the Swinomish Channel must be dredged at least every three years. Dedicated federal funding for continued dredging was eliminated in the 1990s. A study in 2004‚Äì2008 determined that sedimentation would render the channel's north end impassable for virtually all vessels by 2015, and its south end by 2019. The channel was dredged again in 2008. In 2012 the Army Corps of Engineers received funding from Congress for another dredging project, which was finished in January 2013.

The channel airs popular English shows from around the globe and mainly focuses on 14- to 35-year-old urban population, with 24-year-old working professionals being its primary target demographic. History Logo used between: 2001-2004 Logo used between: 2004-2008 Star World was first launched in India on 15 December 1991 as a flagship feed of Star World Asia. Then known as StarPlus, it was the product of a partnership between Star TV and Zee Telefilms. In order to avoid competition within, the contract between the two conglomerates clearly encased the territories of operation for both networks: StarPlus exclusively aired English programming, with Zee TV being its Hindi-language counterpart. However, on facing severe losses and very little market growth, Star violated the terms of the contract by slowly incorporating more and more Hindi programming into its schedule. Zee took Star to court over violation of the non-competing clause and shortly after that Star's partnership with Zee was dissolved in July 2000. Consequently, Star TV split Star Plus' beam into two, in effect, providing two separate services for different regional audiences within Star TV's footprint. Star India took over the reins of the network in the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East, which enabled the channel to provide appropriate programming at accessible viewing time for audience across different regions of Asia. Subsequently, StarPlus was transformed into a Hindi-language general entertainment channel, with Star World becoming the network's English-language GEC. Initially, the channel followed a scheduling format similar to American networks, with new episodes of shows being aired on a weekly basis, a few days after their US telecast. This was altered in early-2010 to shows being aired on a daily basis (Monday-Friday), to consolidate the channel's core viewership and appeal to the population of India. Thereafter, programming was classified into weekdays, weekends and late night slots, with new shows being brought in on a monthly basis throughout the year. The channel's high-definition feed was launched on 15 April 2011. Programming Star World primarily airs popular shows from the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. Star also holds exclusive broadcast, as well as streaming rights to all of HBO's original programming in India. =Programming blocks= Star World Weekend Binge On 25 April 2015, STAR World launched its weekend special programming block known as the Star World Weekend Binge. The block's main features included the latest episodes critically acclaimed shows, airing throughout the day. Star World Now Trending On 21 September 2016, Star World introduced a new programming block called Star World Now Trending where the latest seasons of the most popular American shows were aired. Highlights included Empire, The Blacklist, How to Get Away with Murder, Quantico, Homeland and Prison Break Star World 10 Tickles Star World introduced a weeknight one-hour comedy block called Star World 10 Tickles on 4 October 2016. Black-ish and New Girl were the first shows to be aired on this block. Later, the block was extended to weekends in November 2016 where the latest seasons of shows like 2 Broke Girls, Speechless, Modern Family and Son of Zorn were aired. Shows That Are Gonna Explode (STAGE) STAGE was launched in June 2019, to air underrated shows with potential on weeknights at 10 pm, within a fortnight of their US broadcast. The initial catalog of shows for this block included Warrior, True Detective, The Passage, Pose, Succession and Fosse/Verdon.

It operated from 1838 to 1931 but it was especially under the leadership of Niels Gade (1850‚Äì90) that it became a meeting place for the city's music life with its own symphony orchestra and choir. Carl Nielsen was director from 1915‚Äì27.\\"Musikforeningen i K√∏benhavn\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 14 November 2010. Other leaders included Franz Gl√§ser, Emil Hartmann and Franz Neruda. History C.E.F. Weyse's Romancer og Sange published by Musikforeningen in 1853 Copenhagen's Musikforeningen was founded in 1836. Its objective was to publish Danish musical works \\"for which failure to publish would represent a loss to art\\". In addition, the association was also to present awards and organise concerts. The mandate for putting on concerts soon became by far the most important function for the Society, making it the leading concert institution in Copenhagen. Gade had been a most effective leader until his death in 1890. He was succeeded by J.P.E. Hartmann, Emil Hartmann's son, who held the post for a few years. Franz Neruda then took over, conducting concerts until his death in 1915. During the early years, the association supported modern developments but even under Gade's leadership policy became more conservative. Under Neruda, the repertoire widened somewhat but still varied little from the classical repertoire of Vienna. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Copenhagen music scene developed rapidly. The Music Society, once the only institution to present orchestral concerts in the winter season, suddenly faced competition from many other organisations such as Koncertforeningen (1874-93), the Royal Orchestra (from 1883), the so-called Pal√¶ concerts at Odd Fellows Mansion (1895-1931) and the Dansk Koncert-Forening (Danish Concert Association) (1901-40). It was therefore more thanks to its name than to its success that the Music Society maintained its status as the city's leading concert provider well into the 20th century. As a private association, it was totally dependent on its members, but as opportunities for concerts increased elsewhere, membership fell steadily. At the height of Gade's term, there had been as many as 2,500 members and each concert was presented twice. By the 1913‚Äì14 season, membership had fallen to 900 and concerts were only performed once.Niels Bo Foltmann, \\"Dirigenten Carl Nielsen og Musikforeningen\\", Fund og Forskning, Bind 42 (2003), Tidskrift.dk. Retrieved 15 November 2010. Structure of the organisation As the Music Society was a private organisation, its concerts were also considered private events although the press were admitted. Financing consisted of membership dues, an annual State subsidy and the receipts of additional concerts open to the public. The Society had an unpaid amateur choir which took part in all its concerts. The orchestra, engaged specially for each concert, consisted of members of the Tivoli Orchestra. There were usually three or four concerts each season which stretched from November to April. From time to time, there were additional concerts open to the paying public. Performances were held at 8 pm on Thursday evenings at Odd Fellows Mansion (often simply called the Pal√¶) in Copenhagen's Bredgade. Rehearsals were on Sunday afternoons, a convenient time for members of the choir. Carl Nielsen's chairmanship Following Neruda's death, Carl Nielsen took over the management of the Music Society's concerts in 1915. There had already been talk of abolishing the association which had been in a state of steady decline even since the great days of Niels Gade. But Nielsen managed to revive interest, reorganising the choir and somewhat modernising the rather conservative repertoire. He started to include works by contemporary Nordic composers such as Wilhelm Stenhammar and Kurt Atterberg and contemporary French music by Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel and Darius Milhaud). Late German romantic composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss were not included. Around 1922, interest drastically declined, not just as a result of the economic recession but especially because the Music Society was increasingly seen as an outdated institution. Poor reviews, triggered perhaps by his lack of professional experience as a conductor, led Nielsen to leave in 1927. He was succeeded by Ebbe Hamerik who, despite considerable experience, was unable to prevent the Music Society's closure in 1931.

It was the first of Schlafly's 19 authored texts, and sold 3 million copies, granting her national attention as a conservative activist. Schlafly mainly published this book in support of Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, hoping to help him triumph in the California primary, thus granting him the ability to be nominated for president. Schlafly's secondary motivation behind the publishing of A Choice Not an Echo was to break control of the \\"Eastern Establishment\\" over the Republican Party. In other words, this book served as an exposition of the covert influence that ‚Äúkingmakers‚Äù had on Republican primary nominations.CPAC in 2011.  Inspiration for A Choice Not an Echo Prior to 1963, Phyllis Schlafly had prepared a whole series of Republican speeches that she hoped to deliver. However, after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, she deemed it inappropriate to give anti-Democratic speeches after his death. Therefore, Schlafly altered course and wrote a speech called ‚ÄúHow Political Conventions Are Stolen‚Äù (a speech that reflected on the liberal Rockefeller administration and how it outmaneuvered the conservatives) in December 1963 and delivered it all throughout January and February the following year. However, Schlafly hoped to create a permanent impact with her writing and thus tasked herself to convert her speech into a book (‚ÄúA Choice Not an Echo‚Äù). By setting up her own publisher, the Pere Marquette Press, Schlafly was able to quickly self-publish her book, which she soon distributed in mass quantities. She sent copies to the Republican National Convention in 1964 urging people to read her book and also sent 5000 copies to a Yurok Convention in California. By the following weekend, Schlafly's book had statewide distribution in California and eventually had sold over half a million copies by May to help support Barry Goldwater's campaign.  Historical context  Throughout the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, Democrats maintained control of the executive office, with the exception of the 1953-1961 Eisenhower presidency. The Republican party had often been split between a conservative wing supported in the Midwest, and liberal wing from the Northeast. The conservative wing, which Schlafly was a part of, opposed New Deal reforms and supported isolationist policies. This wing was represented by candidates such as Robert A. Taft in 1948. On the other side, the liberal wing of the Republican party demanded more efficient use of New Deal policiesNash references David W. Reinhard, The Republican Right since 1945, (University Press of Kentucky, 1983). and were led by Thomas E. Dewey, who Schalfly claims was subject to the will of the kingmakers. The liberal wing maintained control of the Republican Presidential nomination until 1964. In 1964, the conservative wing made a comeback against the liberal wing by nominating Barry Goldwater. Goldwater defeated Nelson Rockefeller and Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., who were on the left side of the GOP. However, Goldwater was defeated by Johnson in the 1964 election.  1964 Republican primaries  Senator Barry Goldwater in 1962.Phyllis Schlafly's A Choice Not an Echo was a key factor in Barry Goldwater's securing of the 1964 republican nomination. In preceding months, Goldwater was close to winning the nomination, but needed to win a major primary in order to do so. The California primary, therefore, was key if Goldwater were to win the republican nomination. The liberal New York governor Nelson Rockefeller opposed Goldwater in the California primary, which was a very close race. Conservative lobbyists and volunteers traveled to various precincts and handed out more than fifty thousand copies of A Choice Not an Echo. Schlafly's book was evidently very influential: later studies showed that Goldwater had secured narrow victories in many of these precincts. Goldwater won the California primary, and got the Republican presidential nomination. Schlafly's influence through A Choice Not an Echo extends even past this, as the nomination for Goldwater spurred Reagan to make his ‚ÄúA Time for Choosing‚Äù speech, and eventually run for governor of California, and later the presidency.  Content  The first appearance of the \\"kingmakers\\" is in Chapter 5. ‚ÄúThe Advertising Agent‚Äôs Holiday‚Äù describes how Wendell Willkie, who was a registered Democrat, was marketed into the Republican presidential candidate by the kingmakers, who were very prominent business and economic figures during the time. Willkie began appearing on the covers of magazines and newspapers, and was placed on panels where the questions were tailored specifically to his knowledge. This type of marketing ensured that he appeared to outsmart other intellectuals on the panels. Despite this marketing, when the Republican National Convention was seven weeks away, Willkie was only favored by 3% of Republicans. When the Republican National Convention arrived, the kingmakers launched ‚ÄúOperation Telegram.‚Äù In this operation, prominent and financially powerful people were called and asked if they would like to send a telegram to the delegates at the Republican National Convention on their behalf. As a result of this, almost a million telegrams flooded the delegates at the convention in favor of Willkie. In addition, cab drivers picking up delegates and taking them to the convention were paid to hint that the nomination was leaning towards Willkie. The combination of these strategies worked, and Willkie won the presidential nomination, with Taft and Dewey trailing behind.Flyer used to challenge Goldwater's campaign.Chapter 12 of A Choice Not an Echo is titled \\"Anybody but Goldwater.\\" In this chapter of her book, Schlafly focuses in on the work of the kingmakers' attempts to prevent Goldwater from securing the Republican popular vote. For example, Schlafly references \\"The chief propaganda organ of the secret kingmakers, The New York Times,\\" demonstrating the tension between Goldwater and the Eastern establishment in the following sentence (extracted from a New York Times article written by Tom Wicker on August 11, 1963) : \\"The most bitter resistance to Senator Goldwater centers in the 'eastern, internationalist power structure that for two decades has dictated Republican nominations. The members of that elite will not lightly relinquish their party to Barry Goldwater.'\\" Schlafly also references other magazines that have published \\"anti-Goldwater\\" texts such as The New Yorker and The Saturday Evening Post. More specifically, Schlafly references an article published in The Saturday Evening Post on January 25, 1964 called \\"How the Republicans Can Win\\" by Arthur Larson, that advises the GOP to select a candidate who appeals to the \\"Authentic American Center\\" (specifically referencing John F. Kennedy at the time). Aside from \\"anti-Goldwater propaganda,\\" Schlafly reveals other strategies used by the kingmakers to keep Goldwater out of the race. For example, the kingmakers posed candidates such as Nelson Rockefeller and George Romney whose main motivation to run for president would be to \\"do everything within my power to prevent him (Goldwater) from becoming the party's presidential choice.\\" Another candidate who posed a threat to Goldwater's campaign was William W. Scranton, who was Governor of Pennsylvania from 1963‚Äì1967. The kingmakers invested a lot of attention in Governor Scranton, \\"showing off Scranton to leading banking, industrial and communications figures in a series of private luncheons.\\" These exclusive meetings included extremely influential individuals who would help bolster Scranton's campaign.

The book helped create space within the Republican Party for the modern conservative movement that eventually stopped the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s. The book helped secure the nomination of Senator Barry Goldwater for President of the United States, and detailed how the liberal \\"Rockefeller Republican\\" wing of the Republican Party had manipulated the Republican Party's choice of nominees in prior national conventions to nominate people like Wendell Willkie and Dwight D. Eisenhower.Hemmer, Nicole. \\"The Three Books That Shook Conservative Media in 1964.\\" The Atlantic. 20 May 2014. 14 December 2018. It called on conservatives to rally against the liberal wing and offer a true conservative for the nomination.

Because glow discharge occurs readily at 110-120 volts AC, one could use these bulbs in standard household lamps in the United States. The phosphors used in the bulbs were somewhat brittle, necessitating care in handling. Shaking or jarring the bulbs would cause flaking and migration of the phosphors to other parts of the metallic sculpture. Such handling would leave non-fluorescing portions of the sculpture and/or migration of phosphors to other surfaces within the bulb. Aerolux bulbs consumed about 3-5 watts of power.

They live in Afghanistan generally in Bamyan, Parwan (Sheikh Ali District), Kunduz and Baghlan provinces, inhabiting the road from Kabul to Mazar-e-Sharif.  History  In the late 19th century, Ishaq Khan rebelled against Afghan king Abdur Rahman Khan at Mazar-e Sharif. Abdur Rahman sent a force against the Ishaq Khan, passing through the Sheikh Ali territory. During their passage the force faced many skirmishes with the local Sheikh Ali over the scarce food and fodder. Once Abdur Rahman quashed the rebellion of Ishaq, he then focused on the Sheikh Ali Hazaras. The Sheikh Ali also resisted, this low level but violent expedition by Abdur Rahman, forced the Hazaras at large to rise against Abdur Rahman, in retaliation for the attacks on the Sheikh Ali Hazaras. This Hazara uprising resulted in the Jang-i-Uruzgan (\\"Battle of Uruzgan\\"). Thereafter, the Sheikh Ali faced a severe backlash from Abdur Rahman, who forcibly evicted many of them from their lands. During this process and there esattled in Kunduz, many of the Sheikh Ali Hazaras perished. Those who reached faced extinction or forced conversion to Sunni Islam. There were a few Sheikh Ali Hazaras who migrated to Quetta, the Shia ones lived with the larger Hazara group in Quetta. = Pishin Sheikh Alis = A Sunni Sheikh Ali Hazara family settled in Pishin, Pakistan, north of Quetta. This family rose to prominence and its members Qazi Muhammad Essa and Qazi Muhammad Musa were among the top Muslim League leaders of Balochistan during the Pakistan Movement. Ashraf Jehangir Qazi son of Qazi Musa is a prominent Pakistani diplomat and has remained Pakistan's ambassador to United States, India and the United Nations. He was also the UNSG special representative in Iraq and Sudan. Qazi Faiz Essa the current Chief Justice of the Balochistan High court is also from this family. Qazi Essa helped the Hazaras from Quetta in sending the first Hazara delegation to United Nations in the 1970s.  Tribes  The Sheikh Ali tribes are Daikalan, Naiman, Qarlugh, Karam Ali and Babur.  Present  Today most of the Sunni Hazaras are from Sheikh Ali, besides from Surkhi Parsa, Taimani and the Hazara-i-ghorband. Some of the Sheikh Ali Hazaras also converted to the Ismaili Shia sect, who mostly inhabit Bamiyan and Baghlan provinces. Sayed Mansur Naderi (in Pul-i-Khumri), a Sheikh Ali Sayd Hazara, is the representative of the Agha Khan in Afghanistan. He was appointed a brigadier in the communist Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and was the main person to contact in maintaining the channels between the Afghan government and the West through the French government.

In response the region organized the PRBC18 office to develop plans for reconstruction. Because Chile is on a tectonic plate border earthquakes are frequent. Therefore, rebuilding similar buildings in the same place is avoided in favor of new designs that will protect people and property. This includes development of tsunami mitigation areas, a redesign of the shorelines of several coastal towns and villages to better resist the effects of future tsunamis.

This request was transferred to Col. Henry \\"Hap\\" Arnold, head of the Western Department of the Air Service. Arnold loaned aircraft to the Forest Service to create aerial patrols, and by 1925, there were aerial patrols in western Montana, Idaho and eastern Washington. Two Airco DH.4 aircraft, based in Spokane, Wash., flew on these patrols, piloted by Nick Mamer and R.T. Freng.\\"Aerial Patrols.\\" Official Web Site. National Smokejumper Association, 2010.

Smokejumper history program  The smokejumper history program is a collection that includes more than 250 video interviews with early smokejumpers, thousands of scanned and original photographs, and thousands of historical documents pertaining to smokejumping. This collection is preserved at the University of Montana's Maureen and Mike Mansfield Library. The NSA has a database of all known smokejumpers and created the first list of smokejumpers killed in action. The NSA is looking into options for cataloguing, storing and displaying historical artifacts.  Mission Statement and values  US Forest Service smokejumpers, based in Deming, New Mexico, 1948 The official Mission Statement and values of the NSA as of July 1, 2009: \\"The National Smokejumper Association, through a cadre of volunteers and partnerships,is dedicated to preserving the history and lore of smoke jumping (sic), maintaining and restoring our nation's forest and grassland resources, responding to special needs of smokejumpers and their families and advocating for the programs (sic) evolution.\\" \\"The values of the NSA are comradeship, education, pride in work well done and loyalty.\\"\\"Mission and Values.\\" Official Web Site. National Smokejumper Association, 2010. Web. 25 November 2010.  Trails Program  The National Smokejumper Association's Trails Program was founded in 1999 by former treasurer Jon McBride and former smokejumper Art Jukkala to field volunteer crews to clear trails, fix historical structures and build corrals and fences.Gidlund, Carl. \\"Jon McBride: A Personal Memoir.\\" Smokejumper: The National Smokejumper Association Quarterly Magazine October 2010: 3-4. Web. 29 November 2010. McBride and Jukkala formed this group to help the Forest Service with trail maintenance, because it had cut back on it due to budget constraints. When Jukkala died of a heart attack during the program's first project that year, McBride became sole director of the Trails Program. Under McBride's leadership, the program expanded from two nine-man crews to 318 one-week crews by the time of his death on June 2, 2010.\\"Jon McBride‚Äî Montana smokejumper and trails steward.\\" American Trails. 2010. Web. 1 December 2010. In 2010, 197 Trails Program volunteers completed 24 projects in six states. Areas with trails opened and maintained by this group included the Boundary Waters, High Sierra, Iditarod Trail and Bob Marshall Wilderness. The Trails Program hopes to add West Virginia to their list of project states by 2011.  Scholarships  The NSA supports three scholarship programs. The first is the Art Jukkala Scholarship Program, which was named after a former smokejumper who died of a heart attack during a Trails Program project. This program awards scholarships to the children of smokejumpers who were killed in action. Four scholarships have been awarded, totaling $10,000. A second program is the NSA Trail Maintenance Smokejumper Chair Scholarship Fund, which provides a yearly scholarship to a smokejumper or child of a smokejumper who is studying forestry at the University of Montana. An NSA Scholarship program is going to start in 2011. This program will give $2,000 annually to smokejumpers or family members pursuing higher education at the trade school or college level.  Good Samaritan Fund  The Good Samaritan Fund was created to financially aid smokejumpers, smokejumper pilots and their families. The NSA has donated over $6,000 since the fund's inception.  Presidents of the NSA  1\\\\. Earl Cooley (1993‚Äì1995): Earl Cooley was one of the first two men in history to parachute from an airplane to fight a fire, which was at the Nez Perce National Forest on July 12, 1940.Bushey, Chuck. \\"Passing of an Era.\\" Wildfire Magazine 2010. Web. 27 November 2010. He trained smokejumpers in Montana during the 1940s, many of whom were conscientious objectors of World War II. On August 5, 1949, Cooley picked the spots for smokejumpers to land during the Mann Gulch fire. A wind shift resulted in 13 deaths, including 12 smokejumpers, the most smokejumper fatalities during one job. An investigation cleared Cooley and a foreman who had helped him pick the landing spots of misfeasance. Cooley said he was never afraid of jumping out of a plane and the only thing he didn't enjoy about smokejumping was the walk home. By the time he died on November 9, 2009, Cooley had jumped almost 50 times.Thursby, Keith. \\"One year ago: Earl Cooley.\\" Los Angeles Times 9 November 2010. Web. 27 November 2010. 2\\\\.

It is located close to Thodupuzha in central Kerala. Kuninji is surrounded by seven hills, which gives it a fortified effect. The place falls under the jurisdiction of Purappuzha gram panchayat with around 1,500 inhabitants. The village is mainly inhabited by Syro Malabar Catholics and Hindus; with the majority being Christian members of the Syro Malabar Catholic Church. Most of the inhabitants are well-to-do farmers and agriculturists trading in rubber, teak wood and cocoa beans and small supplementary businesses. The land is extremely fertile and almost any plant not in need of a very cool climate is known to grow extremely well. In the early 1950s, residents were 100% self sufficient in terms of food as they grew rice, mangoes, jack fruit, tapioca, coconut, cashew, coffee, raspberries, mulberries, and a range of spices including black pepper, cardamom, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. The production of rice though has dropped in the last few decades while the other crops and plantations continue to grow. Most families use bio gas and solar water heaters to keep the green village a sustainable village. The climate is slightly warm and humid with the weather improving during the rains and in the month of December when it's relatively cool. The known landmark in this village is a church named after St. Antony a top the Kuninji Hill and a temple in the name of Mahadeva and Sree Narayana Guru, a well known social reformer of Kerala. Kuninji has a small town center popularly referred to as Chelappara, a term derived from a nearby rock. * On the east of Kuninji is Kodikuthi Hill * On the west is Thattaranirappu hill * On the north are the Kottamala and Kurian Kunnu hills * On the south are the Attupurath Hills. Kurian Kunnu hill is the highest among these hills, rising above sea level. Kottamala Hill has a height of above sea level. This hill is famous for its 2.5 km stretch on top that could have easily been (but never was) the site to build a fort. The view from atop Kottamala hill on a clear day reaches up to Cochin, Ernakulam and the Arabian Sea, which is 80 km away from the base of the hill. Kodikuthi Hill got the name during the British Rule, by a British surveyor, who did the survey of this area. The remnants of the survey still exists atop this hill. Kuninji has in recent years been the location for Malayalam movie shoots. Elsamma Enna Aankutty was partially shot in the village by well-known Malayalam director Lal Jose.

PLOT3D was created by NASA Ames Research Center in 1982 by Pieter Buning and remains an often used file format. It can only store a structured grid. The structured grid allows random access, that is by knowing the block number, i location, j location, and k location, any grid point value or result value may be extracted. Additionally, given the location of any value, the block number, i location, j location, and k location may be determined. This makes it simple to iterate through a series of volumetric elements and calculate all required properties for the purpose of a CFD analysis. The most basic format includes two different files, a grid file (G-file) and a solution file (Q-file). The filename extensions used vary, though .q is common for Q-files. Grid files may use .g, .x, .xy, or .xyz, among other extensions. The grid file contains the coordinates of the solution grid, while the solution file contains information typical of a CFD solution, flow density, flow momentum (a vector), and flow energy. Data may be stored in either binary or ASCII text format and floating point values may be either single or double precision. There are also multiblock and unstructured extensions to the format, so it is often unclear how a particular set of nominally PLOT3D-format files is formatted on the binary level without referring to the software that created them. Examination with a hex editor may be useful in determining the format variant. Additional files may be present containing different kinds of ancillary data. \\"Formatted\\" FORTRAN (ASCII text) data files will typically use CR-LF (0x0d 0x0a) delimiters at the end of the line, though the line breaks are implementation dependent. \\"Unformatted\\" FORTRAN (binary) files have the variables laid out in the same order but will normally lack delimiters such as line breaks. The binary format will be implementation and machine dependent. A multiblock, 3 dimensional Q file begins with a single integer for the number of blocks M on its own line. The next M lines contain three integers for each of the blocks, which give the i, j, and k dimension sizes for each block. The M blocks are read in next. Each block begins with a line containing four floating-point values, the freestream Mach number, the freestream angle of attack, the freestream Reynolds number, and the time. The rest of the block contains the values iterated over i, j, k, m (block index), and the outermost n, which counts through 5 sections, the density, the 3 components of the momentum, and finally the energy. A multiblock, 3 dimensional grid file begins with a single integer for the number of blocks M on its own line. The next M lines contain three integers for each of the blocks, which give the i, j, and k dimension sizes for each block. The M blocks are read in next. Each block contains a coordinate value iterated over i, j, k, and then the three coordinates, x, y, and z. Additionally, the format may be simplified such that only a two-dimensional problem is analyzed or the iBlank parameter is omitted. The iBlank parameter indicates whether or not the cell is a physical or non-physical cell. For example, if two PLOT3D grids are intersected, one of an aircraft fuselage, and the other of an aircraft wing, there are internal cells that should not be analyzed. These are iBlank'ed cells and have a value of 0.

The claims were first raised in 1951. The story was covered by the worldwide press and led to a highly publicized international investigation in 1952. US Secretary of State Dean Acheson and other US and allied government officials denounced the allegations as a hoax. Subsequent scholars are split about the truth of the claims.  Background  Until the end of World War II, Japan operated a covert biological and chemical warfare research and development unit called Unit 731 in Harbin (now China). The unit's activities, including human experimentation, were documented by the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials conducted by the Soviet Union in December 1949. However, at that time, the US government described the Khabarovsk trials as \\"vicious and unfounded propaganda\\". It was later revealed that the accusations made against the Japanese military were correct. The US government had taken over the research at the end of the war and had then covered up the program. Leaders of Unit 731 were exempted from war crimes prosecution by the United States and then placed on the payroll of the US. On 30 June 1950, soon after the outbreak of the Korean War, the US Defense Secretary George Marshall received the Report of the Committee on Chemical, Biological and Radiological Warfare and Recommendations, which advocated urgent development of a biological weapons program. The biological weapons research facility at Fort Detrick, Maryland was expanded, and a new one in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, was developed.  Allegations  During 1951, as the war turned against the United States, the Chinese and North Koreans made vague allegations of biological warfare, but these were not pursued.Winchester, Simon; The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom; New York: Harper Collins; 2008; pp. 199‚Äì200McCormack, Gavan; \\"Korea: Wilfred Burchett's Thirty Year's War\\"; in Kiernan, Ben (ed.); Burchett: Reporting the Other Side of the World, 1939-1983; London: Quartet Books; 1986; pp. 202‚Äì203.Harris, Sheldon H.; Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare, 1932‚Äì45, and the American Cover-up; Taylor & Francis; 2002 General Matthew Ridgway, United Nations Commander in Korea, denounced the initial charges as early as May 1951. He accused the communists of spreading \\"deliberate lies\\". A few days later, Vice Admiral Charles Turner Joy repeated the denials. On 28 January 1952, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army headquarters received a report of a smallpox outbreak southeast of Incheon. From February to March 1952, more bulletins reported disease outbreaks in the area of Chorwon, Pyongyang, Kimhwa and even Manchuria. The Chinese soon became concerned when 13 Korean and 16 Chinese soldiers contracted cholera and the plague, while another 44 recently deceased were tested positive for meningitis.Zhang 1995, p. 182. Although the Chinese and the North Koreans did not know exactly how the soldiers contracted the diseases, the suspicions soon fell on the Americans. On 22 February 1952, the North Korean Foreign Ministry made a formal allegation that American planes had been dropping infected insects onto North Korea. This was immediately denied by the US government. The accusation was supported by eye-witness accounts by the Australian reporter Wilfred Burchett and others.Knightley, Phillip; The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-maker from the Crimea to Kosovo, revised ed.; London: Prion; 2000; p. 388. In June 1952 the United States proposed to the United Nations Security Council that the Council request the International Red Cross investigate the allegations. The Soviet Union vetoed the American resolution due to extensive US influence inside the Red Cross, and, along with its allies, continued to insist on the veracity of the biological warfare accusations. In February 1953, China and North Korea produced two captured US Marine Corps pilots to support the allegations. Colonel Frank Schwable was reported to have stated that: \\"The basic objective was at that time to get under field conditions various elements of bacteriological warfare and possibly expand field tests at a later date into an element of regular combat operations.\\" Schwable's statement said that B-29s flew biological warfare missions to Korea from airfields in American-occupied Okinawa starting in November 1951. Schwable's statement was obtained following months of torture and abuse at the hands of his captors, according to the US military. Other captured Americans such as Colonel Walker \\"Bud\\" Mahurin made similar statements. Upon release the prisoners of war repudiated their confessions which they said had been extracted by torture. However, the retractions happened in front of military cameras after the United States government threatened to charge the POWs with treason for cooperating with their captors. When one of the POWs who retracted his confession was tracked down in 2010, he denied being ill-treated or indoctrinated by the North Korean or Chinese guards. = International Scientific Commission = International Scientific Commission for the Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in China and Korea, page 403 When the International Red Cross and the World Health Organization ruled out biological warfare, the Chinese government denounced them as being biased by the influence of US, and arranged an investigation by the Soviet-controlled World Peace Council.Guillemin, Jeanne; Biological Weapons: From the Invention of State-sponsored Programs to Contemporary Bioterrorism (M1, via Google Books), Columbia University Press; 2005; pp. 99‚Äì105; .

The commission's findings included eyewitnesses, testimonies from doctors, medical samples from the deceased, bomb casings as well as four American Korean War prisoners who claimed the US use of biological warfare. On 15 September 1952, the final report stated that the US was experimenting with biological weapons in Korea.Winchester, Simon; The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom; New York: Harper Collins; 2008; pp. 203‚Äì208. The full ISC report, including all appendices, was posted for the first time online in downloadable PDF format in February 2018 by Jeffrey Kaye of INSURGE Intelligence. The report suggested a link to the World War II Japanese germ warfare Unit 731. Former Unit 731 members Shir≈ç Ishii, Masaji Kitano, and Ryoichi Naito, and other Japanese biological warfare experts were often named in the allegations. Former members of Unit 731 were linked initially, by a Communist news agency, to a freighter that allegedly carried them and all equipment necessary to mount a biological warfare campaign to Korea in 1951. The commission placed credence on allegations that Ishii made two visits to South Korea in early 1952, and another one in March 1953. The official consensus in China was that biological weapons created from an American-Japanese collaboration were used in the Korean episode. Citing the claims Ishii had visited South Korea, the report stated: \\"Whether occupation authorities in Japan had fostered his activities, and whether the American Far Eastern Command was engaged in making use of methods essentially Japanese, were questions which could hardly have been absent from the minds of members of the Commission.\\"[Report of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of the Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China (Peking and Prague, 1952), p. 14] The International Association of Democratic Lawyers (IADL) publicized these claims in its 1952 \\"Report on U.S. Crimes in Korea\\", as did US journalist John W. Powell. = The Sams mission = The Communists also alleged that US Brigadier General Crawford Sams had carried out a secret mission behind their lines at Wonsan in March 1951, testing biological weapons.Benson, Sonia G.; Korean War: Almanac and Primary Sources; New York: Gale; 2003; p. 182. The US government said that he had actually been investigating a reported outbreak of bubonic plague in North Korea, but had determined it was hemorrhagic smallpox. Sams' mission had been launched from the US navy's LCI(L)-1091, which had been converted to a laboratory ship in 1951.\\"FEDCU One Fight an Unseen Enemy\\", Navy.mil, United States Navy During its time in Korea, the ship was assigned as an epidemiological control ship for Fleet Epidemic Disease Control Unit No. 1, a part of the US effort to combat malaria in Korea. (See footnote 5.) After covert missions in North Korea, from October to September 1951, LSIL-1091 was at Koje-do testing residents and refugees for malaria.Marshall, p. 272.  Counterclaims  The US and its allies responded by describing the allegations as a hoax. The US government declared IADL to be a Communist front organization since 1950, and charged Powell with sedition. In a highly publicized 1959 trial, Powell was indicted on 13 counts of sedition for reporting on the allegations, while 2 of his editors were indicted on 1 count of sedition each. All charges were dropped by the government after the case was dragged on for five years. However, Powell was then blacklisted and thereafter unable to secure work as a journalist for the rest of his life. American authorities have continually denied the charges of postwar Japanese-United States cooperation in biological warfare developments, despite later incontrovertible proof that the US pardoned Unit 731 in exchange for their research, according to Sheldon H. Harris. Australian journalist, Denis Warner, suggested that the story was concocted by Wilfred Burchett as part of his alleged role as a KGB agent of influence. Warner pointed out the similarity of the allegations to a science fiction story by Jack London, a favorite author of Burchett's.Warner, Denis, Not Always on Horseback: An Australian Correspondent at War and Peace in Asia, 1961‚Äì1993; St Leonards: Allen and Unwin; 1997; pp. 196‚Äì197. However, the notion that Burchett originated the \\"hoax\\" has been decisively refuted by one of his most trenchant critics, Tibor M√©ray.M√©ray, Tibor; On Burchett; Kallista, Victoria, Australia: Callistemon Publications; 2008; pp. 73‚Äì76. M√©ray worked as a correspondent for Hungary during the war but fled the country after the abortive uprising of 1956. Now a staunch anti-Communist, he has confirmed that he saw clusters of flies crawling on ice.M√©ray, Tibor; On Burchett, Callistemon Publications, Kallista, Victoria, Australia; 2008; p. 51. M√©ray has argued the evidence was the result of an elaborate conspiracy: \\"Now somehow or other these flies must have been brought there ... the work must have been carried out by a large network covering the whole of North Korea.\\"M√©ray, Tibor; On Burchett, Callistemon Publications, Kallista, Victoria, Australia; 2008; p. 252.  Disease prevention measures  Chinese photograph of infected fleas allegedly spread by the United States Recent research has indicated that, regardless of the accuracy of the allegations, the Chinese acted as if they were true. After learning of the outbreaks, Mao Zedong immediately requested Soviet assistance on disease preventions, while the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Logistics Department was mobilized for anti-bacteriological warfare. On the Korean battlefield, four anti-bacteriological warfare research centers were soon set up, while about 5.8 million doses of vaccine and 200,000 gas masks were delivered to the front.Zhang 1995, p. 185. Within China, 66 quarantine stations were also set up along the Chinese borders, while about 5 million Chinese in Manchuria were inoculated. The Chinese government also initiated the \\"Patriotic Health and Epidemic Prevention Campaign\\" and directed every citizen to kill flies, mosquitoes and fleas. These disease prevention measures soon resulted in an improvement of health for Communist soldiers on the Korean battlefield. Tibor M√©ray provided eyewitness account of North Korea conducting an \\"unprecedented campaign of public health\\" during the allegation.M√©ray, Tibor; On Burchett, Callistemon Publications, Kallista, Victoria, Australia; 2008; pp. 261‚Äì262.  Subsequent evaluation  Some historians have offered other explanations to the disease outbreaks during the spring of 1952. For example, it has been noted that spring time is usually a period of epidemics within China and North Korea,Zhang 1995, p. 184. and years of warfare had also caused a breakdown in the Korean health care system. US military historians have argued that under these circumstances, diseases could easily spread throughout the entire military and civilian populations within Korea.Lech 2000, p. 162. Australian historian Gavan McCormack argued that the claim of US biological warfare use was \\"far from inherently implausible\\", pointing out that one of the POWs who confessed, Walker Mahurin, was in fact associated with Fort Detrick.McCormack, Gavan; \\"Korea: Wilfred Burchett's Thirty Year's War\\"; in Kiernan, Ben (ed.); Burchett: Reporting the Other Side of the World, 1939-1983; London: Quartet Books; 1986; pp. 204. He also pointed out that, as the deployment of nuclear and chemical weapons was considered, there is no reason to believe that ethical principles would have overruled the resort to biological warfare. He also suggested that the outbreak in 1951 of viral haemorrhagic fever, which had previously been unknown in Korea, was linked to biological warfare. In a 1988 book Korea: The Unknown War, historians Jon Halliday and Bruce Cumings also suggested the claims might be true.Auster, Bruce B.; \\"Unmasking an Old Lie\\" ; U.S. News and World Report; 16 November 1998; retrieved 7 January 2009. They questioned whether the North Koreans and the Chinese could have \\"mounted a spectacular piece of fraudulent theater, involving the mobilization of thousands\\", getting scores of Chinese doctors, scientists, and senior officials \\"to fake evidence, lie and invent medical fraud\\", allocating much of their already stretched logistical resource to defend against biological warfare, all for a propaganda campaign against US. In 1989, a British study of Unit 731 strongly supported the theory of United States‚ÄìJapanese biological warfare culpability in Korea. In 1995, using available Chinese documents, historian Shu Guang Zhang of University of Maryland stated that there is little, if any information that currently exists on the Chinese side which explains how the Chinese scientists came up with the conclusion of US biological warfare during the disease outbreak in the spring of 1952. Zhang further theorized that the allegation was caused by unfounded rumors and scientific investigations on the allegation was purposely ignored on the Chinese side for the sake of domestic and international propaganda.Zhang 1995, p. 186. Published in Japan in 2001, the book Rikugun Noborito Kenkyujo no shinjitsu or The Truth About the Army Noborito Institute stated that members of Japan's Unit 731 also worked for the \\"chemical section\\" of a US clandestine unit hidden within Yokosuka Naval Base during the Korean War as well as on projects inside the United States from 1955 to 1959.Central Intelligence Agency review of \\"Rikugun Noborito Kenkyujo no shinjitsu (The Truth About the Army Noborito Research Institute)\\" By Shigeo Ban. Tokyo: Fuyo Shobo Shuppan, 2001 According to Jeffrey Kaye's interpretation of a \\"Memorandum of Conversation\\" from the Psychological Strategy Board (PSB) dated 6 July 1953 (and declassified and released by the CIA in 2006), the US protestations at the United Nations did not mean the US was serious about conducting any investigation into biological warfare charges, despite what the government said publicly. The reason the US didn't want any investigation was because an \\"actual investigation\\" would reveal military operations, \\"which, if revealed, could do us psychological as well as military damage\\". The memorandum, which had been sent to CIA director Allen Dulles, specifically stated as an example of what could be revealed \\"Eighth Army preparations or operations (e.g. chemical warfare).\\" Investigative journalist Simon Winchester concluded in 2008 that Soviet intelligence was sceptical of the allegation, but that North Korea leader Kim Il Sung believed it.Winchester, Simon; The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom; New York: Harper Collins; 2008; pp. 212‚Äì214. Winchester said the question \\"has still not been satisfactorily answered\\".Winchester 2008, p. 199. Entomologist Jeffrey A. Lockwood wrote in 2009 that the biological warfare program at Ft. Detrick began to research the use of insects as disease vectors going back to World War II and also employed German and Japanese scientists after the war who had experimented on human subjects among POWs and concentration camp inmates. Scientists used or attempted to use a wide variety of insects in their biowar plans, including fleas, ticks, ants, lice and mosquitoes ‚Äì especially mosquitoes that carried the yellow fever virus. They also tested these in the United States. Lockwood thinks that it is very likely that the US did use insects dropped from aircraft during the Korean War to spread diseases, and that the Chinese and North Koreans were not simply engaged in a propaganda campaign when they made these allegations, since the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of Defense had approved their use in the fall of 1950 at the \\"earliest practicable time\\". At that time, it had five biowarfare agents ready for use, three of which were spread by insect vectors.Jeffrey Alan Lockwood, Six Legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War. Oxford, 2009. In March 2010, the allegations were investigated by the Al Jazeera English news program People & Power. In this program, Professor Mori Masataka investigated historical artifacts in the form of bomb casings from US biological weapons, contemporary documentary evidence and eyewitness testimonies. The program also uncovered a crucial document in the US National Archives which showed that in September 1951, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff issued orders to start \\"large scale field tests ... to determine the effectiveness of specific BW [bacteriological warfare] agents under operational conditions\\". Masataka concluded that: \\"Use of germ weapons in war is in breach of the Geneva Convention. I think that's why the Americans are refusing to admit the allegations. But I have no doubt. I'm absolutely sure that this happened.‚Äù The program concluded by noting that no conclusive evidence of the US's innocence or culpability has ever been presented. Yanhuang Chunqiu, a liberal pro-democracy monthly journal in China, published an account in 2013 allegedly from Wu Zhili, the former surgeon general of Chinese People's Voluntary Army Logistic Department, which said that the bio warfare allegation was a false alarm, and that he had been forced to fabricate evidence. This account was published after the author's death in 2008. Its authenticity subsequently has been called into question by the Chinese Korean War Museum as unverifiable, because every single figure involved in the alleged private conversations and insider events from the account who could testify otherwise, had died before the date of publication. The museum also refuted the account's claim that \\"not one casualty resulted from events associated with biological warfare\\" as there are many clear records of such casualties, and claimed that it's implausible for a meager medical officer back then to have the technical knowledge to fool dozens of international medical experts signing the ISC report. In 2019, the Pyongyang Times repeated the allegation, and said that the US government was continuing to develop biological warfare capabilities to use against North Korea. =Endicott and Hagerman= In 1998, Canadian researchers and historians Stephen L. Endicott and Edward Hagerman of York University made the case that the accusations were true in their book, The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets from the Early Cold War and Korea.Endicott, Stephen L.; Hagerman, Edward; The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets from the Early Cold War and Korea (Google Books, relevant excerpt); Bloomington: Indiana University Press; 1998; pp. 75-77; ; retrieved 7 January 2009. The book received mostly positive reviews, but with some negative criticism, with a US Military Academy professor calling the book an example of \\"bad history\\" and with another review in The New York Times calling the book's lack of direct evidence \\"appalling\\",Regis, Ed; \\"Wartime Lies?\\"; The New York Times; 27 June 1999; retrieved 7 January 2009. although neither of these two negative reviews considers either the admissions that the US deployed chemical and biological weapons by Colonels Schwable and Mahurin, or the US chemical and biological weapons caches at locations such as Camp Detrick and elsewhere or even the extensive documented history of clandestine drug tests undertaken among the US population itself (cited in sources such as biographies of Frank Olson). Many other reviews praised the research, with the director of East Asian studies at University of Pennsylvania saying \\"Endicott and Hagerman is far and away the most authoritative work on the subject\\", a review in Korean Quarterly calling it \\"a fascinating work of serious scholarship...presenting a compelling argument that the United States did, in fact, secretly experiment with biological weapons during the Korean War\\", and a review in The Nation calling it \\"the most impressive, expertly researched and, as far as the official files allow, the best-documented case for the prosecution yet made\\". A staff writer at state-owned China Daily noted that their book was the only one to have combined research across United States, Japan, Canada, Europe and China, as they were \\"the first foreigners to be given access to classified documents in the Chinese Central Archives\\". In response, Kathryn Weathersby and Milton Leitenberg of the Cold War International History Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center released a cache of Soviet and Chinese documents in 1998 that they said revealed the allegations to have been an elaborate disinformation campaign.Weathersby, Kathryn; Leitenberg, Milton; \\"New Evidence on the Korean War\\"; Cold War International History Project; Wilson Center; 1998; retrieved 4 March 2011. The handcopied documents are purportedly from Russian Presidential Archive, discovered by a Japanese reporter Yasuo Naito of Sankei Shimbun, a major conservative anti-communist Japanese national newspaper. Weathersby admitted that due to the way the documents are collected, there is no way to confirm their authenticity as seals, stamps or signature are missing, but due to their complexity and interwoven content, they are \\"extremely difficult to forge\\" and thus credible sources. They said that North Korea's health minister traveled in 1952 to the remote Manchurian city of Mukden where he procured a culture of plague bacilli which was used to infect condemned criminals as part of an elaborate disinformation scheme. Tissue samples were then used to fool the international investigators. The papers included telegrams and reports of meetings among Soviet and Chinese leaders, including Chairman Mao Zedong. A report to Lavrenti Beria, head of Soviet intelligence, for example, stated: \\"False plague regions were created, burials ... were organized, measures were taken to receive the plague and cholera bacillus.\\" These documents revealed that only after Stalin's death the following year did the Soviet Union halt the disinformation campaign.Auster, Bruce B. \\"Unmasking an Old Lie\\" ; U.S. News and World Report; 16 November 1998; retrieved 29 October 2013. Weathersby and Leitenberg consider their evidence to be conclusive‚Äîthat the allegations were disinformation and no biological warfare use occurred.Leitenberg, Milton (1998), The Korean War Biological Warfare Allegations Resolved. Occasional Paper 36. Stockholm: Center for Pacific Asia Studies at Stockholm University (May issue).Leitenberg, Milton (1998), \\"New Russian Evidence on the Korean Biological Warfare Allegations: Background and Analysis\\"; Woodrow Wilson Center Cold War International History Project, Bulletin 11 (Winter issue), pp. 185-199.Weathersby, Kathryn (1998), \\"Deceiving the Deceivers: Moscow, Beijing, Pyongyang, and the Allegations of Biological Weapons Use in Korea\\", Woodrow Wilson Center Cold War International History Project, Bulletin 11 (Winter issue), pp. 176‚Äì185. In 2001, anti-communist writer Herbert Romerstein supported Weathersby and Leitenberg's position while criticizing Endicott's research on the basis that it is based on accounts provided by the Chinese government. In turn, Endicott and Hagerman responded to Weathersby and Leitenberg, noting that the documents are in fact handwritten copies and \\"the original source is not disclosed, the name of the collection is not identified, nor is there a volume number which would allow other scholars to locate and check the documents\\". They claimed that even if genuine the documents do not prove the United States did not use biological weapons, and they pointed out various errors and inconsistencies in Weathersby and Leitenberg's analysis. According to Australian author and judge, Michael Pembroke, the documents associated with Beria (published by Weathersby and Leitenberg) were mostly created during the time of the power struggle after Stalin's death and are therefore questionable. In 2018, he concluded that: \\"It seems likely that the full story of the United States' involvement in biological warfare in Korea has not yet been told.\\"  See also  * 2001 anthrax attacks - a rogue agent at Fort Detrick was the suspected perpetuator, according to FBI investigations * Khabarovsk War Crime Trials * Misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic * Operation Big Buzz * Operation Big Itch * Operation Drop Kick * Operation Sea-Spray - declassified US navy secret experiment in 1950 where supposedly harmless pathogens are sprayed over San Francisco in open-air tests of germ warfare. * Project 112 * SARS conspiracy theory * Unethical human experimentation in the United States * United States biological weapons program * Yellow rain  Further reading  * Shiwei Chen, \\"History of Three Mobilizations: A Reexamination of the Chinese Biological Warfare Allegations against the United States in the Korean War,\\" Journal of American-East Asian Relations 16.3 (2009): 213‚Äì247. * John Clews, The Communists.

When he stops to help her, it is the mystery blonde with her clothes awry and her thigh bloody. Loading her into his car, he stops at the first house to ask for help. An all-male party is going on and they think he has brought them some entertainment. They show him and her to a bedroom, where she revives sufficiently to make love, inflicting deep bites to his neck. In the morning, she and all the guests have gone. Walter finds a chain she was wearing that has her name engraved on a plaque - Marie-Ange van de Reeves. Stopping for a coffee, he sees in the morning paper that Marie-Ange is due to marry Henry de Corynthe but has been abducted. He rushes back to the empty house and asks next door, but gets no help. At last going to de Corynthe's house, he finds him dying from a heart attack and the police searching for clues over Marie-Ange's whereabouts. Walter blunders on trying to find the truth about Marie-Ange, while the police suspect him of murder. It is possible that the real Marie-Ange died years ago and that what de Corynthe and Walter have fallen in love with is a vampire. It is also possible that Walter is dreaming the whole mystery. As he drives off to work one morning, he again sees the body of Marie-Ange in the road. A van full of police in combat gear arrives, and Sara Zeitgeist orders them to shoot him.

The film was entered into the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival. In a review, Tim Lucas noted that it was \\"not especially successful in France, but it was one of (Robbe-Grillet's) most popular films abroad.\\" Lucas also noted that Sight & Sound Alain Robbe-Grillet is \\"said to be rigorously protective of his films -- despite their exploitable elements of sex, mystery, fetishism and even supernatural horror -- not wishing them to become associated with the similar though less cerebral works of fellow oneirics and eroticists like Jean Rollin and Jess Franco; consequently, they have had virtually no authorised presence on home video apart from an academically issued limited edition of SECAM tapes in the 1980s.\\" A DVD of the La Belle captive was released by Koch Lorber in 2007. Reception Critic Tim Lucas (Sight & Sound) described the film as \\"Robbe-Grillet lite. Its lead actors fail to fascinate and it lacks the hypnotic allure that distinguished Marienbad and L'Immortelle.\\" Lucas opined that the film may \\"have been more involving, one imagines, had its allusions been subtitled, rather than its narcissistic dialogue and narration.\\" but that the film still \\"shares the self-reflexive sense of humour of Robbe-Grillet's Trans-Europ Express and that \\"several of (cinematographer) Alekan's images are appropriately captivating.\\" Michael Brooke (Sight & Sound) noted that despite the DVD cover's comparison to David Lynch's Eraserhead, La Belle captive was \\"Alain Robbe-Grillet's most explicit tribute to the original French Surrealist movement.\\", noting that \\"Robbe-Grillet constantly undermines narrative, temporal and spatial expectations at every turn while teasing the viewer with iconography drawn from Magritte, American thrillers, Murnau's Nosferatu and much else. It's tempting to assume that the somewhat vacant lead performances are absolutely as intended, the better to offset Daniel Emilfork's grotesque police investigator, smirking at knowledge that he's withholding from everyone else.\\" References External links * Category:1983 films Category:French avant-garde and experimental films Category:French films Category:French-language films Category:Films directed by Alain Robbe-Grillet Category:Films produced by Anatole Dauman Category:1980s avant-garde and experimental films ","title":"La Belle captive"},{"id":"29603731","text":"Genealogica Grafica is a utility for the creation of genealogical charts and reports for web publishing.

The day of the first full moon of the lunar year and Dano are also festive occasions. Jeongdongjin is a picturesque area with a quaint railway station alongside the sandy beach. Long a favorite spot among the locals, the area gained wider popularity after being chosen as the filming location for the popular soap opera Moraeshigae (meaning Sandglass) in 1994. A key attraction of Jeongdongjin is the sunrise. The early morning sun rising over the ocean and outlining the train station and surrounding pines is a sight that has been described as \\"straight out of a fairy tale\\". During the New Year, Jeongdongjin Sunrise Park is the location of the Sunrise Festival and the ceremonial \\"turning of the hourglass\\", signifying the changing year.

Antonio Aloysius Petrus Isopi first lived and worked in his home city as a sculptor and soon specialized on restoring antique pieces of art. The iron cast W√ºrttemberg heraldic animals lion and hart ‚Äì still to be seen in front of Stuttgart's New Castle ‚Äì are one of his major works.  Life  Antonio was the third son of Silvestro and Geltrude Isopi n√©e Orlandi. The father was a servant of Don Giuseppe Finali, a cleric at the papal court. Only four of the eleven children born between 1754 and 1772 reached adulthood. The Isopis lived in the centre of Rome near the Trevi fountain. Since 1768 until Antonio's departure to Germany the family lived in a servant wing of Palazzo Apostolico Quirinale ‚Äì once the summer residence of the pope, today the residence of Italy's president.  Artistic career  Isopi was trained by the sculptors Francesco Franzoni (1734‚Äì1818 ) and Lorenzo Cardelli (1733‚Äì1794). Equally, the re-discovery and restoration of antique sculptures and the work of sculptor and restorer Bartolomeo Cavaceppi influenced Isopi's style. He worked in the Villa Borghese and in the Museo Pio Clementino. Cardelli's workshop was next-door to Antonio Canova‚Äòs, the new star in the world of art. Franzoni ‚Äì coming from an established family of stone sculptors and marble quarry owners in Carrara ‚Äì was becoming the leading restorer of antique statues in the Vatican. Several times Pope Pius VI personally visited his workshop. In the 1780s Isopi had his own workshop and training centre in Rome, where he taught sculpting, restoring and ornamenting, which was beneficial for his later occupation in W√ºrttemberg.  Work at the Stuttgart court  Monumental vase in Ludwigsburg The ambassador to the Vatican of W√ºrttemberg's Duke Carl Eugen, Gaetano Marini, recommended Isopi to the duke as an ornament designer and animal sculptor. Isopi was to be a professor at the Hohe Karlsschule and teach W√ºrttemberg's youth stone sculpting. These plans were never realized, since Duke Carl Eugen died in 1793, soon after Isopi's arrival in Stuttgart. The school was closed soon afterwards. In 1795 Isopi became a member of the committee for residence construction and worked in the castles in Stuttgart, Hohenheim and Ludwigsburg. The quality of his stucco ornaments attracted even Goethe who would have liked to employ him in Weimar permanently. It was, however, not until 1798/99 that Isopi in fact was in Weimar for a temporary employment. He helped re-building the Weimar Castle.Goethe reflects his own visit to Hohenheim and Isopi‚Äôs work in Weimar in his diary for September 1797 Decorative vase with fox and stork Isopi found recognition of his talent for detailed stone sculpting of gorgeous vases and burial memorials in classicist style, as well as true-to-detail depiction of animals. In 1810 Isopi started establishing an art school in Ludwigsburg, which was attached to the china manufacture. In creating decorative marble statues Isopi was unrivalled. He gained wide recognition for designing vases, urns, fountains, sepulchers or garden ornaments. Artists‚Äò School in Ludwigsburg From 1809 till his death Isopi was mainly occupied in Ludwigsburg. His job as an instructor at the Artists‚Äò School (K√ºnstlerinstitut), which he had founded himself in 1810, is particularly remarkable. He had to train junior staff for the attached china manufacture and provide models and templates for china and metal works of art. For a long time Isopi's school was the only educational institution in the field of art in the whole of W√ºrttemberg. However, King Wilhelm I had to close the institute in 1817 because of financial shortage due to the hunger years 1816/17 caused by the eruption of volcano Tambora in Indonesia.  Stag and lion , Isopi‚Äôs most famous work  Stag When, in 1806, W√ºrttemberg became a kingdom King Friedrich I commissioned his royal sculptor Isopi, who had been raised to knighthood, to create monumental sculptures of the two heraldic animals, stag and lion. New power required new demonstration of power. In a technically complicated procedure, after five years of experimenting and producing, Isopi, assisted by his pupil Ernst Mayer, succeeded in creating two huge sculptures, which were to be placed in front of the royal castle. It was a piece of pioneer work in iron casting.  The Glyptothek of Ludwig I of Bavaria in Munich  Isopi was famous for his skill in restoring antique statues. This led to contacts with the Bavarian royal house. From 1818 to 1820 Isopi, accompanied by his pupil Ernst Mayer, restored antique statues for the Glyptothek in Munich which was built by Leo von Klenze for King Ludwig I.

It was first described in relation to lignan/phenylpropanoid-type phytochemicals, with isolation from a variety of plant sources, in particular, in relation to wounding and other physiologic changes.  Occurrence and biological role  Historically, this substance has been best known for its involvement in plant-pathogen recognition, especially its role as a signal attracting and transforming unique, oncogenic bacteria in genus Agrobacterium. The virA gene on the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the Ri plasmid of Agrobacterium rhizogenes is used by these soil bacteria to infect plants, via its encoding for a receptor for acetosyringone and other phenolic phytochemicals exuded by plant wounds. This compound also allows higher transformation efficiency in plants, as shown in A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation procedures, and so is of importance in plant biotechnology. Acetosyringone can also be found in Posidonia oceanica and a wide variety of other plants. It is secreted at wounded sites of dicotyledons. This compound enhances the Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation in dicots. Monocotyledons lack this wound response, which is considered the limiting factor in Agrobacterium-mediated gene transformation in monocots. The compound is also produced by the male leaffooted bug (Leptoglossus phyllopus) and used in its communication system.Acetosyringone on www.pherobase.com, the pheromones data base In vitro studies show that acetosyringone increases mycorrhizae formation in the fungus Glomus intraradices. A total synthesis of this simple natural product was performed by Crawford et al. in 1956, but is of limited contemporary synthetic interest. A variety of acetosyringone analogues are available, including some which are covalent inactivators of cellular processes that involve acetosyringone.  Chemical characteristics  Acetosyringone does not dissolve well in water. Although it has a melting point of about 125 degree Celsius, it is not wise to autoclave acetosyringone along with the medium used for (for example) plant infiltration by microbes.

The old school tie refers to a tie voluntarily worn by alumni of long established British schools. Figuratively, it is used to refer to the connection between members of the elite who attended the institutions: this is particularly associated with public schools. School tie A school tie indicates pupils of a particular school, or year group, or of a particular house in that school. In addition, for some schools, the school tie is not merely an indication that the student belongs to a group or community but the tie is a part of the concept called \\"smart\\": which associates tidy school uniforms with high standards. There are scholars who view the school tie as a way for people to distinguish between groups and social classes in the way students are labelled according to the colour of their ties and their uniforms. Old school tie  An old school tie or old boys tie is a tie that, on leaving school, former pupils are entitled to wear. They will be in their old school or old-boy society colours. According to protocol, it may only be worn by former pupils. This symbol can be a discreet passport to the old boy network, and such ties can be an indication of one's social standing. Conversely, wearing a tie to which you have no right is a serious social gaffe. Although originally an institution of male-only schools, some schools of mixed or female-only membership do present their female leavers with a tie or other equivalent. Alternative clothing such as socks, scarfs, pyjamas and even underwear may also be available in the old-boy/old-girl colours. These exclusive ties are not limited to British public schools: they are also a practice of some elite schools in Australia, many private and some of the more prestigious state schools in New Zealand, many clubs, military regiments and colleges of universities such as Oxford and Cambridge, and have also spread to some of Britain's former imperial possessions, including Canada and the United States. As a metaphor The 'old school tie' is used by the British press and many native English speakers as a metaphor for old-boy social networks, nepotism, and the relatively disproportionate success of former pupils of major public schools, especially in politics and business. For example, after the 2010 General Election, The Times noted that 6% of the parliamentary Tory Party were Old Etonians, under the headline \\"Tories' old school tie still rules\\". Five years later, in 2015, the New Statesman observed that, \\"The power of the old boys' network lives on: privately educated students earn more than those with identical qualifications educated by the state\\".

It starts at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof and runs via Harburg to Stade. It mostly runs parallel with the line to Hanover and the Lower Elbe line and is now part of the Hamburg S-Bahn lines S3 and S31. Route  The route begins at the Hauptbahnhof, where it climbs a steep ramp before crossing the tracks of the main lines to Berlin and to L√ºbeck. After running on a concrete viaduct, on which, Hammerbrook station is located, the line crosses the southern freight railway bypass and the Northern Elbe bridge. The line now runs directly parallel with the line to Hanover. After Veddel and Wilhelmsburg stations the line moves away from the Hanover line and dives into a tunnel. The line passes through the stations of Harburg, Harburg Rathaus (which has three platforms) and Heimfeld and then climbs to the surface and runs parallel with the Lower Elbe line. It then passes through the stations of Neuwiedenthal and Neugraben, which has a parking area. After this station there is a change in electrical systems, where S-Bahn trains switch from third rail to overhead wire electrification. The S-Bahn trains then run along the Lower Elbe line, which was upgraded for S-Bahn services in 2006 and 2007. History  After the inclusion of Harburg-Wilhelmsburg in Hamburg in 1937, the Harburg‚ÄìNeugraben line was included in the Hamburg S-Bahn network for ticketing purposes. After the founding of the Hamburg Transport Association in 1967, locomotive-hauled trains provided S-Bahn services on the route, marketed as line S3. The long- distance tracks were used between Hamburg Hauptbahnhof and Hamburg-Harburg station. Although this section of the line had four tracks, one pair of tracks was reserved for freight traffic. Due to the heavy destruction of the port of Hamburg in 1945, Oberhafen and Elbbr√ºcke stations were not reopened. While the population of the Hamburg district of Hausbruch and Neugraben-Fischbek grew strongly in the 1960s and 70s with the construction of new housing estates, transport connections with central Hamburg was poor: to reach Hamburg Hauptbahnhof a change of trains was required at Harburg. Moreover, trains did not operate at regular intervals. On 24 September 1983, the S-Bahn line commenced operations from Hamburg to Harburg Rathaus with DC-powered trains. The new line separates from the Hamburg-Altona link line between the Hauptbahnhof and Berliner Tor station. A new station was built on the line at Hammerbrook. Between the Northern Elbe bridge and Harburg the line runs parallel with the main line. The old Veddel and Wilhelmsburg stations on the main line were replaced with stations on the new line. In 1984, S-Bahn line (operating as lines S3 and S31) was extended from Harburg Rathaus to Neugraben. The line runs for about seven kilometres from the Heimfeld district parallel and south of the Lower Elbe line. A new S-Bahn station was established near the large settlement of Neuwiedenthal. Neugraben station was expanded to five platform tracks and its late nineteenth reception building was replaced with an interchange in the concrete style of the 1980s. An extension of the S-Bahn to the densely populated area of Fischbek was dropped so as not to undermine the viability of the newly established shopping centre in Neugraben. With the opening of the new S-Bahn line the stations of Unterelbe, Tempo-Werk and Hausbruch on the old main line were abandoned. Since the timetable change in December 2007, Hamburg S-Bahn operation have been extended from Neugraben via Buxtehude to Stade. These operations use new or remodelled two-system S-Bahn electric multiple units of class 474.3. These services run in mixed operations with Metronom regional trains and with freight trains, using alternating current from the overhead line. In addition, an additional station was established at Fischbek.

Web. 19 September 2020 He is mainly known for his canvases and frescoes of landscapes and formal gardens with banquets and music-making groups.Lodewijk Toeput, View of an Italian Town with an Arched Bridge at Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen His landscapes had an important influence on the next generation of Flemish landscape artists such as Joos de Momper, Tobias Verhaecht and Gillis and Frederik van Valckenborch. Life The early life of Lodewijk Toeput in his native Flanders is not documented and the date and place of his birth are not known with certainty. The late 16th century biographer Karel van Mander who claimed to have met Toeput in Venice, placed Toeput's birthplace in Mechelen. While many contemporary art historians tend to identify his birthplace as Antwerp there is still no consensus view. In Antwerp he is believed to have studied with Maerten de Vos, a leading history painter who had studied in Italy.Lodewijck Toeput in: Karel van Mander, Het Schilderboeck, 1604 Anne-Sophie Banner, Les jardins dans l'oeuvre de Lodewijk Toeput : entre tradition flamande et culture v√©nitienne, D√©partement d‚Äôhistoire de l‚Äôart et d‚Äô√©tudes cin√©matographiques, Facult√© des arts et des sciences, M√©moire pr√©sent√© √† la Facult√© des √©tudes sup√©rieures, En vue de l‚Äôobtention du grade Ma√Ætre (M.A.) en histoire de l‚Äôart, D√©cembre 2014, p. 21 Banquet in the Park While the date of his departure from his home country is not documented, it is believed the artist arrived around 1573‚Äì74 in Venice. According to Carlo Ridolfi's Le maraviglie dell'Arte (1648), Toeput initially worked in the studio of Tintoretto. Here he likely was in contact with his fellow countryman Paolo Fiammingo (Pauwels Franck), who was also residing and working in Venice. The artists may actually have met in Tintoretto's workshop.Anne-Sophie Banner, p. 23 Toeput is recorded in Florence in the late 1570s. A stay in Rome is not documented, but it is believed on the basis of drawings of ancient Roman churches that at the beginning of the 1580s Toeput stayed in this city. He then probably resided in Venice for a brief period but was documented in February 1582 in Treviso, near Venice, where he lived and worked for the rest of his life. It is possible that the artist moved from Venice to Treviso because the Venetian painter's guild did not grant him membership and thus the right to work in Venice. Despite his residence in Treviso, Toeput kept in touch with Venice where he met with artistic personalities such as Jacopo Bassano, Hans von Aachen, members of the Sadeler family, Otto van Veen and Pieter de Jode I.Luigi Menegazzi, Ludovico Toeput (il Pozzoserrato), in: Saggi e Memorie di Storia dell'Arte No. 1 (1957), Neri Pozza Editore S.p.a., pp. 165, 167-223 Pleasure garden with a maze In Treviso there was at the time a high demand by religious and civilian patrons for artwork.Anne-Sophie Banner, p. 24 One important assignment was for decorations for the Monte di Piet√†, a communal pawnshop, for which Toeput created frescos of scenes from the Old and New Testament and parables alluding to the works of mercy.Anne-Sophie Banner, p. 29 The artist married Laudamia Aproino in 1601 in Treviso. In Italy, the painter was known as Ludovico Pozzoserrato, the literal translation into Italian of his Flemish name Toeput which can be read to mean ‚Äò'Closed Well'‚Äô.Larry Silver, 'Peasant Scenes and Landscapes: The Rise of Pictorial Genres in the Antwerp Art Market', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012, p. 195 After he established his residence in Treviso, the artist referred to himself as Lodovico Pozzo da Trevigi. He died in Treviso some time between 1 January 1604 and 9 September 1605.Lodewijk Toeput at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Work Toeput painted frescoes, altarpieces and paintings with Biblical scenes, landscapes, city views and genre scenes of Venetian social life depicting formal gardens with banquets and music-making groups. He painted several historical allegories from the Bible and mythological themes from the Metamorphoses. He made many religious paintings for the Venetian churches.Anne-Sophie Banner, p. 27 Toeput was principally known for his landscape frescoes and canvases, which combine Flemish and Venetian styles. These landscapes typically depict spacious vistas, full of atmospheric and picturesque effects. His paintings and frescoes can be found in situ in various Italian cities such as Padua, Treviso and Conegliano.Lodewijk Toeput at Hadrianus Concert in a villa courtyard Toeput is also known for his allegorical compositions. In the frescoes of the Villa Chiericati-Mugna, executed between 1587 and 1590, he developed a series of allegorical landscapes, which represent the months of the year, each recognizable by their astrological sign. The series is complemented by a trompe l'oeil of a door that reveals a page with a dog, a painting above the fireplace with Apollo holding a lyre and friezes containing mythological figures along the walls.Anne-Sophie Banner, pp. 32‚Äì33 Toeput left various drawings representing the seasons and months of the year. The Allegory of Spring and Allegory of Winter in the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery likely inspired Joos de Momper's own treatment of this subject.Suzanne Boorsch, John Marciari, 'Master Drawings from the Yale University Art Gallery', John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, Yale University. Art Gallery, Blanton Museum of Art, Yale University Press, 2006, pp. 92‚Äì95 The flight into Egypt Toeput painted various elegant gardens with figures engaging in courtly love or concerts. Many of his garden scenes were likely inspired by contemporary Flemish prints. For instance, his Pleasure garden with a maze (Hampton Court Palace) was likely inspired by the Garden with labyrinth by Hans Vredeman de Vries and Party in a garden, both engraved by Pieter van der Borcht the Elder. Toeput's best known garden scene Concert in a villa courtyard Musei civici di Treviso) appears to draw inspiration from Crispijn van de Passe the Elder's engraving of Adolescentia Amori after a design by Toeput's presumed master Maerten de Vos.Anne-Sophie Banner, pp. 42‚Äì43 Toeput's earliest known drawing, Lot and his daughters, dates from 1573 (St√§del). It shows his closeness to his presumed master Maerten de Vos. The influence of his Venetian master Tintoretto is also palpable. This work and other works by Toeput are also close to, and have often been confused with, those of his Flemish compatriot Paolo Fiammingo (Pauwels Franck) who also resided in Venice at the same time. Toeput drew many biblical and mythological scenes, but was primarily a draftsman of cityscapes and panoramic landscapes. Landscape with Heracles and the Ox-Driver Toeput's drawings show his interest in topography. His Panorama of Treviso and View of Aquapendente were engraved and included in volume V (1598) of Georg Braun and Frans Hogenberg's six-volume atlas, the Civitates orbis terrarum (Cologne, 1572‚Äì1618). He also created imaginary landscapes, such as the Landscape with St John on Patmos (New York, Pierpont Morgan Library), showing his characteristic trees with windswept foliage framing a finely detailed panorama depicted from a high viewpoint. Many of his drawings depict landscapes including urban views and often feature bridges. Usually, cities and landscapes occupy most of the space while the human figures are of small scale. The cities are typically characterized by high towers. The landscapes are mountainous and suggest distance. He often placed an object such as a tree on the left or right side of his drawings in order to link the front and back of the composition. An example is the Landscape with Heracles and the Ox- Driver (Hermitage. Moscow). His urban views recall those of the Venetian Domenico Campagnola.Anne-Sophie Banner, pp. 26‚Äì27 Toeput was in demand as a designer of prints. Flemish engravers who travelled through Venice such as Rafael I Sadeler would engrave after his existing designs or order new designs from him.Anne-Sophie Banner, p. 25 References External links * Category:1550 births Category:1605 deaths Category:Mannerist painters Category:Artists from Antwerp Category:People from Treviso Category:Flemish Renaissance painters Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Flemish history painters Category:16th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters ","title":"Lodewijk Toeput"},{"id":"29604321","text":"Scott LaValla (born July 4, 1988 in Olympia WA) is a retired American rugby union player.

Our lady of ransom church view from the beach Flag Mast Ransom Mary in Indian Tradition Two golden cars  Location  Kanniyakumari village is situated in the District of Kanniyakumari which is the southernmost part of the Indian subcontinent. the place is also referred as the lands end. The Kanniyakumari Parish almost coincides with the civil village of Kanniyakumari. It is closely associated with the mainstream Catholic faith in India. According to census 2011, the Kanniyakumari district comprising 48.74% of Christians in Tamil Nadu.  History  The tomb stones unearthed at Kumari Muttom, near Kanniyakumari contain evidences to show that Catholics were living there for many centuries. The tomb stones dated 1496 contain the edict of the local ruler granting tax exemptions to the residents of Kumari Muttom and authorizing levy of a cess from the fishermen in Kumari Muttom. The aggregate income thus generated had to be used to keep the lights of the church burning. In 1542 when St. Francis Xavier came to Cape Comerin (Kanniyakumari) he found ‚ÄòOur Lady of Delights Grotto‚Äô, at Kanniyakumari. Then it became a center for mission activities of the Jesuits from Thoothoor to Ramanathapuram. It is believed that Our Lady of Delights Grotto, in which St. Francis Xavier prayed, later became the church of Our Lady of Ransom. Our Lady of Ransom is the Patron of the congregation in Spain which redeemed the Christians from the Muslim invasion in the year 1218. The people of Kanniyakumari combined the name Ransom with Delight and call their patron Alangara Upakara Matha.  Old church of 18th century  A small thatched church was upgraded to a big church of Roman architecture was constructed in 1700 AD. A statue of Mother Mary made during 16th century derived from Rome to Kanniyakumari. A golden altar was developed and the statue of Mother Mary was placed in the centre of the altar and venerated by the name of Alangara matha. The statue of St. Joseph and St. Francis Xavier were placed in the right side and left side respectively. There are wooden carvings depicting the coronation of Mary as queen of heaven and earth. Intricately carved depictions of angels playing the musical instruments like violin, flute and drums in the upper and side adorn the altar. Jesus Christ inviting his disciples for ministries and forgiving Mary Magdalene were depicted in the side of the altar. Cardinals, a Pope, and soldiers having foliage in their hand are depicted. There are carvings of 12 disciples of Jesus Christ. A lamb lying on the Holy Bible is depicted in the lower portion of the altar. The old church remains part of the new church.  History of the flagstaff  In 1917 a foreign (German) merchant ship carrying coal was grounded on the sandy shore of Leepuram, Kanniyakumari, and could not be refloated; it was abandoned and sold at auction to Kayathan Villavarayan, a merchant from Tuticorin. He donated the iron mast to Our Lady of Ransom Church, Kanniyakumari. The kattumarams of Kanniyakumari were brought to Leepuram to take the mast to Kanniyakumari. When the mast was loaded on the kattumarams, the mast together with the kattumarams sank, then began to float. The mast was taken to Kanniyakumari by road, it was fitted into a bore hole in a stone and fixed in place with molten lead.  New Church  The foundation stone for the new church was laid on 31 May 1900 by Fr. John Consolvez. Mr. Pakiam Pillai of the Vadakkankulam was the architect of the new church. It is the model of ancient Gothic Art and culture. The length of the new Church is 153 feet, breadth 53 feet and height is 153 feet. All these depict the breads of the Holy Rosary. = Dimensions = The church is constructed by the model of ancient Gothic Art and culture. The length of the new Church is 153 feet, breadth 53 feet and height of the main tower is 153 feet. This entire dimension depicts the beads of the Holy Rosary. There are 12 towers in the church which depict 12 disciples of Jesus Christ.  Porch and other doors  The porch ends with a pointed arch. The church contains totally 7 doors, 3 as porch and 2 doors facing north and 2 doors facing south which depict the 7 fruits of the Holy Spirit. Several clustered Gothic piers provide support to the main tower. Inside the church, there are compound pillars which resemble vertical shafts that provide support to the ceiling which is made with nave vault and transverse arches. Two side towers attached with the main tower act as belfry containing the church bells which have been imported from Italy in 1900 AD. The bell was used for several decades to signal time. Gigantic statues of St. Thomas and St. Francis Xavier are placed on the main tower. The veneration of Mother Mary is celebrated every year from 1‚Äì31 May.  Developments  The church has had several parish priests. In 1914 Msgr. Vincent Fdo celebrated the First Mass in the newly built Church. In 1956 Rev. Fr. Josaphath Maria completed the front elevation and the pinnacles. In 2006 the parish celebrated the golden jubilee of the erection of the golden cross and 106th year of laying the foundation of the church.  Our Lady of Ransom Church  When entering to the church one can see a beautiful statue of Mother Mary got from Italy and clad in a sari ‚Äì like in most [South Indian] churches and a little Cross on the altar. The beautiful paintings of four disciples of Jesus Christ and writers of New Testament of the Bible namely Mark, Matthew, Luke and John are exquisite on the main altar and the Mother Mary statue is located in the middle of the main altar. The colorful light patterns thrown by the stained glass windows on side of the church gives a rainbow appearance inside the church.

The feeds, in the form of granules or pellets, provide the nutrition in a stable and concentrated form, enabling the fish to feed efficiently and grow to their full potential. Many of the fish farmed more intensively around the world today are carnivorous, for example Atlantic salmon, trout, sea bass, and turbot. In the development of modern aquaculture, starting in the 1970s, fishmeal and fish oil were key components of the feeds for these species. They are combined with other ingredients such as vegetable proteins, cereal grains, vitamins and minerals and formed into feed pellets. Wheat, for example, is widely used as it helps to bind the ingredients in the pellets. Other forms of fish feed being used include feeds made entirely with vegetable materials for species such as carp, moist feeds preferred by some species (easier to make but more difficult to store), and trash fish ‚Äî that is fish caught and fed directly to larger species being raised in aquaculture pens.  Hatchery feeds  Specialised feeds are produced for fish hatcheries. In species such as salmon and trout, the newly hatched fry first feed from their yolk sacs and then can be fed with starter feeds. Marine species such as sea bass, sea bream, flounders and turbot consume the nutrition in their yolk sacs during the first few days post hatching and then are fed for several weeks on live prey,www.fao.org in the form of rotifers and brine shrimp (Artemia). Special feeds can be used to enrich the nutritional value of the prey. Rotifers are usually bred in the hatchery while brine shrimp are generally collected from the wild, e.g. salt lakes. Manufactured feed alternatives to brine shrimp are becoming available, offering more consistent nutrition and improved sustainability as demand increases with the growth of aquaculture.  Development of manufactured feeds  Until the end of World War II most fish hatcheries relied on raw meat (horse meat in particular) as a dietary staple for trout. In the early 1950s, John E. (Red) Hanson, while working for the New Mexico Game and Fish Department, began experimenting with dietary routine and dry pellet formulations. The first fish feed pellets were introduced to hatchery trout at the Red River Hatchery near Taos. The pellets resulted in improved conversion rates of food intake to fish production, and lead in turn to the wider adoption of fish pellets in hatcheries.Sigler JW and Sigler WF (1986) \\"History of fish hatchery development in the Great Basin states of Utah and Nevada\\" The Great Basin Naturalist, 46 (4): 583‚Äì594. The development of dry pelleted fish feeds to date has two themes. One theme is on improving digestibility and refining the balance of nutrients to match the needs of the different species of fish more precisely at different periods of development. The other theme is to improve the sustainability of the ingredients used. This is being achieved mainly by identifying additional sustainable sources of ingredients, in particular to reduce the need for fishmeal and fish oil. Improving the efficiency of feeding also contributes to sustainability.  Sustainability  Fish feed production in Stokmarknes Norway Dry fish feed pellets Traditionally two of the most important ingredients have been fishmeal and fish oil. These come mainly from the processing of fish from the wild catch, usually pelagic species that are generally not suited to processing for human consumption. Fish sold for human consumption attract a higher price than those used to make fishmeal. The fishmeal fisheries are often referred to as reduction fisheries. The world's largest reduction fishery is in the Pacific, off the coast of Peru and Chile and is regulated by the governments of those countries. The North Atlantic is another important source of fish for fishmeal and fish oil. Many major suppliers belong to the International Fishmeal and Fish Oil Organisation.IFFO Fishmeal is a brown, flour-like material made by specialist producers that cook, press, dry and grind the fish. The fish oil is effectively a by-product of this process that proves to be a rich source of energy and fatty acids for fish, including the important long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA now linked to the health benefits associated with eating oily fish such as salmon and mackerel. Fish in general also are good sources of many vitamins and minerals and are often recommended as part of a healthy diet by governmental food agencies.Food Standards Agency, UK American Hearts AssociationAgence nationale de s√©curit√© sanitaire Because the catches of wild fish must be managed at sustainable levels to ensure the stocks continue to be viable, the available supply of fishmeal and fish oil from these resources will not increase. The global demand for fish from consumers around the world is increasing. Reasons include the growing population, rising average incomes and greater awareness of fish as part of a healthy diet. The yield from the wild catch cannot be increased sustainably, therefore, in the opinion of observers such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, aquaculture must fill the gap. Currently the supply of fish from aquaculture approximately matches that from the wild catch, according to FAO figures. The current drive in research and development is enabling this to happen by supplementing fishmeal and fish oil with vegetable proteins and oils, while ensuring the fish continue to provide the important health benefits for consumers. Other potential raw material resources are also being explored. For example, the U.S. biotechnology company BioTork is piloting the use of raw materials such as unmarketable papaya and by-products from biodiesel production to produce fish feed components,http://www.gainesville.com/article/20140821/articles/140829906 as well as feeding agricultural waste to algae and fungi that manufacture some of the proteins and omega-3 oils needed for fish food.http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/projects/projects.htm?ACCN_NO=422341&fy;=2013 The US biotechnology company Calysta and the UK/Danish biotech company Unibio opened small plants in the UK and Denmark to produce fish feed from natural gas in 2016.  Modern fish feed  Extruded fish feed Modern fish feeds are made by grinding and mixing together ingredients such as fishmeal, vegetable proteins and binding agents such as wheat. Water is added and the resulting paste is extruded through holes in a metal plate. The diameter of the holes sets the diameter of the pellets, which can range from less than a millimetre to over a centimetre. As the feed is extruded it is cut to form pellets of the required length. The pellets are dried and oils are added. Adjusting parameters such as temperature and pressure enables the manufacturers to make pellets that suit different fish farming methods, for example feeds that float or sink slowly and feeds suited to recirculation systems. The dry feed pellets are stable for relatively long periods, for convenient storage and distribution. Feeds are delivered in bulk, in large bags‚Äîusually one tonne, or in 25 kilogram bags. Smaller quantities of specialist feeds are supplied for use in fish hatcheries.

The temple is surrounded by the Bindusagar Tank on the west in Bhubaneswar. Legend Lord Brahma came to Bhubaneswar to attend the coronation of Lingaraj Deva. Here he was requested to stay forever, but he assured that he will come every year on the month of Chaitra for the Ashokashtami festival. Again he assured that he will be the charioteer (Sarathy) of the Rukuna Rath of Shri Lingaraja. So a temple was erected in honour of him near Bindusagar. Architecture The main temple is of late Kalingan style dating back to 15th century. The present temple was built during the Gajapati Rulers. The temple features a four-handed black chlorite image of Brahma. He is holding Veda and water vessel in upper two hands and rosary, abhaya mudra in lower two hands.

History, directory and gazetteer of the county... White Francis. 1864 It is now a hotel. The building is Grade II* listed. Colwick Hall is constructed of red brick, with ashlar dressings and hipped slate roofs with a 2-storey central block and single-storey wings. The frontage has four Ionic pillars surmounted by a pediment. History The earliest references to the estate occur on the death of William de Colwick in 1362, when it passed by the marriage of his daughter Joan to Sir Richard Byron, into the Byron family. The Byrons lived here for over 150 years until about 1660, when they moved to Newstead Abbey and Colwick Hall came into the ownership of the Musters family. John Musters replaced all of the older buildings with the present Hall in 1775‚Äì1776.The Buildings of England: Nottinghamshire. Nikolaus Pevsner. London. 1979, pp.251-252 The new house was built by local builder, Samuel Stretton, from designs of John Carr of York. It was enclosed with a moat, crossed by drawbridge on the north side. In 1805 John Musters's son Jack married Mary Chaworth, Byron's childhood love-interest from Annesley Hall. In 1827 Jack inherited Colwick Hall from his father, but in 1831, during the Second Reform Bill disturbances, it was sacked and partly burned by rioters. Mary Chaworth Musters spent the night in pouring rain with her daughter Sophia, crouched beneath the shrubbery and died at Wiverton Hall some four months later from the shock. Jack and Mary's eldest son, John George Chaworth Musters (1807‚Äì1842), predeceased his father. He had married Emily Hamond, the youngest daughter of Philip Hamond of Westacre, Norfolk. Both of them died of tuberculosis, leaving three orphaned children. The eldest son, John Chaworth Musters (1838‚Äì1887), inherited the estates from his grandfather Jack in 1847. He in turn was succeeded in 1887 by his son John Patricius Musters (1860‚Äì1921), who in 1888 obtained licence to add the surname Chaworth to his own. In 1896 the Hall was sold to the Nottingham Racecourse Company - the racecourse opened in 1892, the Hall became a public house and the rest of the buildings were used to accommodate grooms and jockeys. Nottingham Corporation acquired the Hall from the Racecourse Company in 1965. The building then fell into disrepair until it was saved by Chek Whyte, who won a competition to restore it. It was then sold to Pearl Hotels and Restaurants.

Early life A Leicestershire farmer's son, Peter Joshua Arnold Lucas was born on 9 July 1914 at Eastwell Hall, near Melton MowbrayEntry No 273 Register book of Births no 23 for District of Melton Mowbray, County of Leicester and educated at Warwick School. He served in the Coldstream Guards from 1936 to 1938, before leaving to join the Warwickshire Police.The Daily Telegraph, p 17, 16 July 1994, Lead Obituary Released for military service, in 1939 he was selected for Sandhurst and commissioned into the Royal Warwickshire Regiment as a Second Lieutenant on 4 June 1940London Gazette (Supplement) no 34888, p 4081, 5 July 1940 Military career In 1942 he was seconded to the 8th Battalion, the Durham Light Infantry (DLI). By March 1943 Rommel was trapped in Tunisia between the 8th Army in the east and the 1st Army in the west. After routing the Americans at the Kasserine Pass he dug his army in at the old French frontier position at Mareth and, a sick man, departed for Europe, leaving Von Arnim in charge. Montgomery began his attack through its northern end, via the formidable Wadi Zigzaou. Lucas was serving in D Company, 8th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, part of 151 Brigade, which established a bridgehead on the far side of the Wadi. In order to widen the bridgehead the Royal Engineers had built a causeway across the Wadi under intense fire, only to see it wrecked by a cloudburst. Meanwhile 75 German tanks, infantry of 15 Panzer Division, a regiment from 90th Light Division and Ramcke parachutists were forming up at Zarat, to attack the brigade. The 8th DLI confronted the German assault with no supporting weapons ‚Äì the few Valentine tanks and anti- tank guns were unable to cross the wadi - and no air support, since the aircraft had been grounded by torrential rain. The German attack began with accurate shelling of the Durhams' position, which caused many casualties. When the gunfire was at its heaviest Lucas, commanding the Bren Gun Carrier Platoon, answered an urgent call from A and B Companies for wireless sets and batteries. Undeterred by the murderous defensive fire sweeping the wadi Lucas went forward in his carrier through a gap in the minefield. He safely crossed the wadi and anti-tank ditch, all the time under heavy fire, and finally reached the forward companies with his valuable cargo. He then returned to Battalion H.Q. the way he had come. Later, under equally difficult conditions, he again undertook the hazardous journey this time with rations and ammunition. There is no doubt that his actions enabled the forward troops to hold onto their positions and Captain Lucas was awarded the Military Cross.London Gazette (Supplement) no 36057, p 2760, 15 June 1943Major P.J.Lewis, M.C./Major I.R.English. M.C. (1952) 8th Battalion the Durham Light Infantry 1939‚Äì1945 pp 183, 210-226. Lucas remained with the 8th DLI during the rest of the North African Campaign. In July 1943 the 8th DLI was part of the invasion force for Operation Husky, the allied campaign to capture Sicily from the Italian and German armies. Alerted to the invasion, the Germans airlifted paratroopers to Catania, north of the 8th Army's landing sites around Syracuse. One of the major links into mainland Sicily was the Primosole Bridge over the River Simeto between Syracuse and Catania. British Paratroopers were sent to capture the bridge (Operation Fustian), but, although the British 1st Parachute Brigade managed to take the bridge, they were forced to retreat due to an overwhelming enemy presence. The Durham Light Infantry and the 44th Royal Tank Regiment raced north to reinforce the paratroops. After wading the Simeto north of the bridge two companies of the 8th DLI succeeded in establishing a bridgehead on the opposite bank, taking the Primosole Bridge over which the remaining two companies of the Battalion were able to pass to reinforce the leading companies. Despite heavy casualties in hand to hand fighting the 8th DLI held the bridgehead until they were reinforced during the night by the 9th and 6th DLI. In the course of the battle Lucas' position in the east of the bridgehead was struck by a German shell; he was seriously wounded in the back and hand and evacuated to Malta. Lucas fought to regain his fitness and rejoined the Royal Warwickshire Regiment after the war. In 1947/48 he served in Palestine in anti-terrorist operations and was mentioned in despatches for gallant and distinguished services during the period 27 September 1947 ‚Äì 26 March 1948.London Gazette (Supplement) no 38505, p 120, 7 January 1949 Afterwards he was seconded to the King's African Rifles (KAR) and fought against the Mau-Mau in Kenya and against communist terrorists in Malaya. His final appointments were as commandant of the Army School of Physical Training at Aldershot and then as administrative commandant of the Defence NBC School at Winterbourne Gunner, Wiltshire. Personal life As a young man he played rugby; he was also a good horseman and shot and took a keen interest in the theatre. In retirement he worked at the School of Infantry, Warminster and was also a councillor on Amesbury Rural District Council. He married, in 1942, Amy Packer, who died in 1985; He is survived by a daughter and two grandchildren.

History It has been proposed that the name of the village derives from the German word sippe, meaning a clan of a limited number of families. Another possibility is that the name derives from the Latin cippus, meaning young forest.J.G.M. Notten, Het Sibber Huis. Valkenburg, 1995, page 9 However, both explanations do not fit with the local pronunciation S√ºp. It is not known when the first inhabitants settled here. It is assumed that the Plateau of Margraten, at the edge of which Sibbe is situated, was gradually deforested and settled after the year 1000.P.J.H. Ubachs, Handboek voor de geschiedenis van Limburg. Hilversum, 2000, page 24-26, 114 The village was first mentioned ('Cybde') in a document in 1307.J.G.M. Notten, Het Sibber Huis. Valkenburg, 1995, page 16 Until 1940 Sibbe was part of the municipality of Oud-Valkenburg. Population: economy, leisure, religion In spite of some small-scale building projects, population has decreased over the last decades. This is the case for most parts of South Limburg, caused by population ageing, low birthrates and negative migration. Sibbe is situated at the edge of the Plateau of Margraten, a fertile loess plain at 160 meters above NAP. Until recently, agriculture was the main means of life on the Plateau. Nowadays, most villagers commute to work in nearby towns like Valkenburg, Maastricht and Heerlen. Being close to tourist hotspot Valkenburg, the village offers some bed and breakfast accommodation, as well as a camping site. The last operating marl quarry in the Netherlands is situated in Sibbe. Tours on mountain bikes and quads are offered in the underground labyrinth in parts of the quarry that are no longer used for mining. Sibbe has a very active community life with various sports clubs (football, handball, table tennis, billiards), a concert band, a mixed choir, a young adults club (Jonkheid), and a carnival club. Although church-going has steeply declined in recent years, most of the inhabitants of Sibbe are still, at least nominally, members of the Roman Catholic Church. The first church was built here in 1840. Before, villagers had to walk the two miles to the parish church of Oud-Valkenburg. Until 1948 the church of Sibbe remained dependent on the church in Oud-Valkenburg. Sights * Sibberh√ºske or Villaertshof. Manor house with a moat and a defensive tower, first mentioned in 1381.J.G.M.

The focus of the Ballarat Show is the display of rural industry, including livestock and produce, with associated competitions and awards. The show also features amusement rides, a sideshow alley and showbags, which are carry-bags full of novelties and sweet-treats produced by various commercial enterprises. The facilities are used all year round for Trash and Treasure market (since 1979) as well as occasional collectors markets, show and shine displays and other events. In 2013-2014, the City of Ballarat initially proposed to redevelop the showgrounds and in 2015, the Council and agricultural society further proposed relocation of the showgrounds to Victoria Park in Newington. During the State Election of 2014, the Andrews Government committed $5.5 million (AUD) toward the development of the Showgrounds. In 2017 the Agricultural Society in consultation with the Ballarat Council agreed that the existing Showgrounds would be redeveloped and proceeds from the sale of the existing land coupled with monies committed from the State Government would be used to develop a newer and larger facility at a greenfield site 3 km North of the existing site by 2022. Beggs Avenue from the ferris wheel during the 2010 Ballarat Show Site The 10 hectare site includes Eureka Stadium which hosts Australian rules football and a number of other display areas and enclosed pavilions. There are a number of sealed roads servicing the site which are used as pedestrian thoroughfares during the show. The main entrance is located at the corner of Creswick Road and Howitt Streets. The main thoroughfare is Beggs Avenue which runs diagonally across the site and feeds into Bolte Place and most of the animal displays. On the northern flank of Beggs Avenue is where the majority of sideshow rides are normally placed. Whykes Street is the other main road and feeds along the southern border of the site. This roadway contains the Howitt Street Pavilion which is used as a permanent market stall shed throughout the year and is used during the Show partly for the sideshow alley and to house static displays. There are a number of large permanent pavilions built throughout the grounds which house merchandise stalls, show animals, static, craft and machinery displays. History The Ballarat Agricultural and Pastoral Society was formed in 1856 and based in Learmonth. The first agricultural show in Ballarat city was held in 1859. In 1861 the Society's showgrounds site was relocated to Lake Wendouree on the North East flank of the lake in an area bounded by Wendouree Parade, Burnbank and Gregory Streets. In 1934 the present site was chosen at the corner of Howitt Street and Creswick Road, Wendouree with all annual shows being held at this location ever since. Following World War 2, a number of surplus 'P huts' and buildings were relocated from the former Ballarat RAAF Base's Wireless and Air Gunnery School for use as administration buildings and pavilions. Many of those buildings remain in use today. In 1951 a 670 yard-long, sand-based harness-racing arena was built that featured two large light towers and overhead lighting gantries.http://www.classicfamilies.net/cf/TrackList.aspx The arena became the home of the Ballarat and District Trotting Club (the oldest harness racing club in Australia) and regularly hosted meetings between 14 April 1952 to December 1965. The Ballarat and District Trotting Club subsequently and permanently relocated to a new purpose-built harness racing complex (Bray Raceway) in the Ballarat suburb of Redan in February 1966. The showgrounds trotting arena subsequently deteriorated and was finally dismantled in 1990 being replaced by the Eureka Stadium (now commercially known as Mars Stadium) and the North Ballarat Sports Club. A smaller grassed animal parade and display area was established between the new stadium and the existing showgrounds pavilions.

He is best known as co-author, with Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown of Learning from Las Vegas, one of the most influential architectural theory books of the twentieth century. He was also principal in the Philadelphia firm Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates. He was born in New Haven, Connecticut. His father was theatre stage and lighting designer George Izenour. He was married, in 1964, to Elisabeth Margit Gemmill. Education and teaching Izenour studied art history at Swarthmore College and architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, before going on to earn a Master of Environmental Design at Yale University in 1969. After completing his degree at Yale, and running the \\"Learning from Las Vegas\\" design studio for Bob Venturi, he found employment in Charles Moore's office in New Haven for a year or two. At some point in the late 1960s/early 1970s, he (and his wife, Elisabeth Margit Gemmill, and their two children, Ann- Kristin Izenour and Tessa) migrated back to Philadelphia so he could reunite with Bob Venturi, John Rauch, and Denise Scott-Brown. \\"He was a unique spirit from the get-go,\\" Ms. Scott-Brown said. \\"The rebellious maverick side of our work appealed to him.\\" She credits him with the nickname, \\"Big Tuna around the office.\\" Steven Izenour, 61, Architect of American Pop, Dies New York Times. August 8, 2001. As well as teaching at Yale University, Izenour also taught at the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University. Learning from Las Vegas While still a grad student at Yale he was the TA who assisted Robert Venturi in 1968 for a studio course and research project titled \\"Learning from Las Vegas, or Form Analysis as Design Research\\". The findings from the research eventually became the book \\"Learning from Las Vegas\\" first published in 1972 and republished in a revised edition in 1977 titled Learning from Las Vegas. The Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form.Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, Steven Izenour, Learning from Las Vegas, MIT Press, Cambridge MA, 1972, revised 1977. Izenour accompanied his senior tutor colleagues, Venturi and Scott Brown, to Las Vegas in 1968 together with nine students of architecture and two planning and two graphics students to study the urban form of the city that was regarded as a \\"non-city\\", the outgrowth of a \\"strip\\", along which were placed parking lots and singular frontages for gambling casinos, hotels, churches and bars. Venturi, Scott Brown and Izenour had previously visited Las Vegas - which had led to the joint article \\"A significance for A&P; parking lots, or learning from Las Vegas\\" (1968). The research group studied various aspects of the city, including its symbolism, the lighting, \\"pattern books\\", \\"styles\\" and \\"illusion/allusion\\". Their conclusion was that, in a city like Las Vegas, symbolism carries greater importance than architectural form. This distinction was epitomized in the difference between what they called \\"ducks\\" and \\"decorated sheds.\\" Most modernist architecture, the authors contended, used expressive mass and volume to convey meaning, like the famous \\"Long Island Duckling\\" on Long Island, whereas more common \\"decorated sheds\\" relied on imagery and signs to do much the same thing. Virtually all architecture prior to the Modern Movement used such decoration to convey meaning, often profound but sometimes simply perfunctory, such as the signage on medieval shop fronts. Only Modernist architecture eschewed such ornament, relying only on its corporeal or structural elements to convey meaning. As such, it became mute and often vacuous, especially when built for corporate or government clients. Learning from Las Vegas caused a stir in the architectural world upon its publication, as it was hailed by progressive critics for its bold indictment of Modernism, and by the status quo as blasphemous. A split among young American architects occurred during the 1970s, with Izenour, Venturi, Robert A.M. Stern, Charles Moore and Allan Greenberg defending the book as \\"The Greys,\\" and Richard Meier, Peter Eisenman, John Heyduk, and Michael Graves writing against its premises as \\"The Whites.\\" It became associated with post-modernism when magazines such as Progressive Architecture published articles citing its influence on the younger generation. When Tom Wolfe wrote his often-pilloried book, From Bauhaus to Our House Venturi, Scott Brown and Izenour were among the heroes the author praised for their stand against heroic Modernism. White Towers In 1979, continuing his studies into the relationship of architecture and pop culture, Izenour along with fellow architect Paul Hirshorn wrote a monograph of the White Tower Hamburgers fast food chain with selected photographs taken in a variety of styles‚Äîfrom the stark and deadpan to family album-like snapshots. In an affectionately written introductory essay, Hirshorn and Izenour described the identifiable and idiosyncratic commercial architectural style of the 1930s and 1940s and documented the development of the White Tower's architecture and stylistic variations. Their conversations with former White Tower's employees, including Charles Johnson, White Tower's architect for over forty years, set their analysis of the buildings within a broader story of corporate culture, mass marketing, and the rise of franchising in the twentieth century.Paul Hirshorn and Steven Izenour, White Towers, MIT Press, Cambridge MA, 1979, revised 2007. Learning from the Wildwoods Similar to the Las Vegas studies, in the 1990s Izenour started university courses for the study and preservation of 1950s Doo Wop architecture in Wildwood, N.J. In association with the University of Pennsylvania, Yale University and Kent State University, he came up with the Wildwoods Redevelopment PlanSteven Izenour, Learning from the Wildwoods... which laid the foundation for the regeneration of the beach resort.Melissa Milgrom, Learning from Steve Izenour, The Metropolis Observed, Metropolis Magazine, January 2002 References External links * Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, Inc. firm web site Category:20th-century American architects Category:Postmodern architects Category:American architecture writers Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:Urban theorists Category:Fellows of the American Institute of Architects Category:United States National Medal of Arts recipients Category:Members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters Category:University of Pennsylvania faculty Category:Yale School of Architecture alumni Category:1940 births Category:Architecture firms based in Pennsylvania Category:Architects from Pennsylvania Category:2001 deaths Category:University of Pennsylvania School of Design alumni ","title":"Steven Izenour"},{"id":"29605570","text":"Four Dimensions () is Taiwanese Mandopop quartet boyband Lollipop F's fourth studio Mandarin album.

Biography Yiannis Boutaris was born in Thessaloniki in 1942, the son of winemaker Stelios Boutaris and Fanny Vlachos. Both his parents were from Vlach background. His mother's family has its roots in the town of Kru≈°evo, now in North Macedonia, while his father's family originates from the town of Moscopole, now in Albania. His primary education was at the Experimental elementary school of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, his secondary education at Anatolia College, and he graduated in chemistry from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 1965 and in oenology from the Wine Institute of Athens in 1967. In his youth he was associated with the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). From 1969 to 1996 he worked for the family wine company Boutari, based in Naoussa. He left the family company to create the Kir-Yianni wine company, based on two estates in abandoned village of Giannakochori and in Amyntaio, in 1998. Boutaris has spoken several times openly about his struggle with alcoholism and his successful effort to quit drinking back in 1991. He is also a supporter of LGBT rights and the legalization of cannabis. =Mayor= During the last decade he is one of the prominent figures of progressive views and politics in Greece as well as a founding member of the ecological organization Arcturos. In 2012 he was chosen as 'the best mayor of the world' for the month of October, by the City Mayors Foundation, based in the UK. In his program was the restoration of Agias Sofias Square and Eleftherias Square, as well as the construction of a Holocaust Museum in the city. Boutaris also declared his wish to build an Islamic mosque, monuments to Thessaloniki's Jews and to the Young Turk Revolution. According to Boutaris, the construction of these monuments will attract Jewish and Turkish tourists to Thessaloniki, who will want to visit their fathers' hometown. On May 20, 2018 he was treated in hospital after being beaten up by a group of Greek ultra-nationalists angry over his appearance at a remembrance event for the Pontic Greek victims by the Ottomans during WWI. The hardliners claimed that Boutaris made a controversial remark on the issue (\\"I don't give a shit\\" if Kemal Atat√ºrk killed Greeks or not\\").Boutaris has called the Turks ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù, The ultra-nationalists in order to target him, they also falsely claimed that Boutaris had proposed renaming a central street in Thessaloniki after Ataturk (born in Thessaloniki in 1881). The plan of the fanatics was to de-contextualise his views and portray him as a traitor despite his efforts to make Thessaloniki a popular destination and despite the fact that he gave thousands of jobs to his fellow citizens. In this context they isolated a phrase where he was recorded to state: \\"Kemal Ataturk was the founder of the Republic of Turkey. (...) I don't give a shit if he killed or not Greeks or whatever else\\". Aristeia, May 20, 2018, Boutaris has repeatedly angered hardliners in Greece because he tried to facilitate relations between Greece and its neighbors and because he opposed nationalist views on the Macedonia naming dispute, the history of the Greco‚ÄìTurkish relations and the Holocaust of the Jews in Greece.Greek mayor (75) kicked and punched by 'far-right thugs' at WWI event.

On 25 March, Crown Prince Constantine was named commander-in- chief of the Army of Thessaly, comprising these two divisions and support units, with Colonel Konstantinos Sapountzakis as his chief of staff. The Army of Thessaly comprised 36,000 men, 500 cavalry and 96 guns. When hostilities broke out on 18 April, the Army of Thessaly was defeated in successive battles on the border passes, the Battle of Farsala and the Battle of Domokos. By the time of the armistice on 20 May, the Army of Thessaly had been pushed out of Thessaly proper by the Ottoman advance.  1912  As war with the Ottoman Empire increasingly became a possibility in the early autumn of 1912, the bulk of the Hellenic Army was gathered in Thessaly, once again under Crown Prince Constantine, comprising the four peacetime infantry divisions and three newly formed from reservists, a cavalry brigade, and auxiliary units, for a total of some 100,000 men, of which ca. 80,000 effectives. In the course of the First Balkan War, the Army of Thessaly overcame the fortified Ottoman positions along the border in the Battle of Sarantaporo and advanced north. Despite a setback of a detached division in the Battle of Sorovich, the main army broke through the Ottoman defences at the Battle of Yenidje, forcing, after a few days, the surrender of Thessaloniki and its garrison. Having effected the union with the allied Serbian and Bulgarian armies, the Army of Thessaly was deactivated, with some units going to reinforce the Epirus front and others settling along the new demarcation line in Macedonia.

It is a measure of well-being assessed in terms of mood, satisfaction with relationships, achieved goals, self-concepts, and self-perceived ability to cope with one's daily life. Life satisfaction involves a favorable attitude towards one's life rather than an assessment of current feelings. Life satisfaction has been measured in relation to economic standing, degree of education, experiences, residence, among many other topics. Life satisfaction is the cognitive form of subjective wellbeing (in contrast with the \\"affective\\" form, happiness). Factors affecting life satisfaction =Personality= One of the primary concepts of personality is the Big Five factor model. This model illustrates what some researchers believe to be the building blocks of every individual's personality. This model considers the dimensions of openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. In a study carried out by Deneve and Cooper in 1998, multiple studies were analyzed with certain personality questionnaires that linked subjective well-being and personality measures. They found that neuroticism was the strongest predictor of life satisfaction. Neuroticism is also linked to people who have difficulty making up their mind, and is common in people who suffer from mental illness. The personality factor \\"openness to experience\\" is positively correlated with life satisfaction. Apart from the personality dimensions studied in the Big Five model, the trait chronotype has been related to life satisfaction; morning-oriented people (\\"larks\\") showed higher life satisfaction than evening-oriented individuals (\\"owls\\"). More frequent socialization can also contribute to overall well-being. Social support via others has been shown to affect the well-being of adults and the overall health of those individuals. Therefore, people who tend to communicate, and who are considered to be more open to others would have a higher-level of life satisfaction. Heritability has been shown to have an effect on how one is ranked in terms of life satisfaction. Heritability plays a role in both personality and individual experiences. Research suggests that heritability can influence life satisfaction to some degree. This study found that there were no individual differences between males and females in terms of the heritability of life-satisfaction, however the personality elements that were affected by heritability did seem to have an effect on their overall life-satisfaction. It has been further suggested that being able to independently deal with negative emotions can influence long-term life- satisfaction. Having a personality capable of properly dealing with emotions like anger, angst, or hate can be beneficial when dealing with similar things later in life. People who are more easy-going tend to deal with their negative emotions differently than someone who is up-tight. These individual differences can influence the way people deal with problems in the present and how they deal with similar situations in the future. =Self-esteem= The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) is a single scale that is used by UNESCO, the CIA, the New Economics Foundation, the WHO, the Veenhoven Database, the Latinbarometer, the Afrobarometer, and the UNHDR to measure how one views their self-esteem, well-being and overall happiness with life. Previous modeling showed that positive views and life satisfaction were completely mediated by the concept of self-esteem, together with the different ways in which ideas and events are perceived by people. Several studies found that self-esteem plays a definite role in influencing life satisfaction. When a person knows himself and his worth, he or she is driven to think in a positive way. There is also a homeostatic model that supports these findings. =Outlook on life= A person's mood and outlook on life can also influence their perception of their own life satisfaction. There are two kinds of emotions that may influence how people perceive their lives. Hope and optimism both consist of cognitive processes that are usually oriented towards the reaching of goals and the perception of those goals. Additionally, optimism is linked to higher life satisfaction, whereas pessimism is related to symptoms in depression. According to Seligman, the happier people are, the less they focus on the negative aspects of their lives. Happier people also have a greater tendency to like other people, which promotes a happier environment. This correlates to a higher level of the person's satisfaction with their life, due to the notion that constructiveness with others can positively influence life satisfaction.Seligman, M. (2002), \\"Positive emotions undo negative ones\\". Authentic Happiness. New York: Simon & Schuster. However, others have found that life satisfaction is compatible with profoundly negative emotional states like depression.Carson, T. (1981), \\"Happiness, Contentment and the Good Life\\". Pacific Philosophical Quarterly. Life-review therapy using Autobiographical Retrieval Practice for older adults with depressive symptoms, in a study carried out by Serrano JP, Latorre JM, Gatz M, and Montanes J, Department of Psychology at Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, demonstrated that, with increased specificity of memories, individuals show decreased depression and hopelessness and increased life satisfaction. =Age= A common view is that age and life satisfaction have a \\"U-shape\\", with life satisfaction declining towards middle age and then rising as people get older. Other scholars have found that there is no general age trend in life satisfaction, arguing that Blanchflower and Oswald's work is misguided for including inappropriate control variables (which cannot affect how old someone is). The psychologists Yuval Palgi and Dov Shmotkin (2009) studied people who were primarily in their nineties. This subject group was found to have thought highly of their past and present. But generally, the group thought lower of their future. These people were very satisfied with their life up until the point they were surveyed but knew that the end was near and so were not quite as hopeful for the future. Intelligence is also a factor because life satisfaction grows as people become older; as they grow older, they become wiser and more knowledgeable, so they begin to see that life will be better and understand the important things in life more. It has been recorded that adolescents seem to have a lower level of life satisfaction than their older counterparts. This could be because many decisions are imminent, and an adolescent could be facing them for the first time in their life. Although many adolescents have insecurities about many aspects of their lives, satisfaction with friends stayed at a consistent level. This is hypothesized to be due to the amount one can identify with those in one's age group over other age groups. In this same study, researchers found that satisfaction with family decreased. This could be because more rules and regulations are typically implemented by parental figures, and adolescents tend to demonize those in control of them. Also, it was found that life satisfaction in terms of sexuality increased. This is because at this age many adolescents reach sexual maturation, which can encourage them to find verification and satisfaction in the idea of a sexual partnership. =Life events and experiences= It has been suggested that there are several factors that contribute towards our level of life satisfaction. Experiences that are both acute events (e.g., death of a loved one) and chronic, daily experiences (e.g., ongoing family discord) influence self-reports of life satisfaction. The book \\"Happier\\" by Harvard lecturer Tal Ben-Shahar argues that happiness should be one's ultimate goal, the primary factor in evaluating alternative choices. As the subtitle implies, Happier recommends for us to pursue immediate joyful experience in ways that contributes to more long-term, meaningful satisfaction. Furthermore, Ben-Shahar argues that pursuing genuine self-motivated goals, rather than just instant pleasure or selflessness in service of long-delayed enjoyment, results in an optimal combination of short- and long-term happiness. Differences in experience can greatly shape the way that we observe and engage with the world around us. It can influence the way we speak to people, the way we act in public, and our general outlook. These experiences which shape the way we think about our surroundings affect our life-satisfaction. Someone who has the tendency to see the world in a more negative light may have a completely different level of satisfaction than someone who is constantly admiring the beauty of their surroundings. People who engage with more stress on average tend to have higher levels of stress can contribute to higher levels of self-report life satisfaction, as long as those who understand how to deal with their stress in a positive way. =Seasonal effects= A recent study tite analyzes time-dependent rhythms in happiness comparing life satisfaction by weekdays (weekend neurosis), days of the month (negative effects towards the end of the month) and year with gender and education and outlining the differences observed.Maennig, W., Steenbeck, M., Wilhelm, M. (2013), Rhythms and Cycles in Happiness, http://www.uni- hamburg.de/economicpolicy/publications.htm Primarily within the winter months of the year, an onset of depression can affect us, which is called seasonal affective disorder (SAD). It is recurrent, beginning in the fall or winter months, and remitting in the spring or summer. It is said that those who experience this disorder usually have a history of major depressive or bipolar disorder, which may be hereditary, having a family member affected as well. Seasonal affective disorder is hypothesized to be caused by the diminishing of the exposure to environmental light which can lead to changes in levels of the neurotransmitter chemical serotonin. Diminishing active serotonin levels increases depressive symptoms. There are currently a few treatment therapies in order to help with seasonal affective disorder. The first line of therapy is light therapy. Light therapy involves exposure to bright, white light that mimics outdoor light, counteracting the presumed cause of SAD. Due to the shifts in one's neurochemical levels, antidepressants are another form of therapy. Other than light therapy and antidepressants, there are several alternatives which involve agomelatine, melatonin, psychological interventions, as well as diet and lifestyle changes. Research has found that the onset of SAD typically occurs between the ages of 20‚Äì30 years, but most affected people do not seek medical help. This could be due to the stigma of mental health issues. Many are afraid to state they are suffering and would rather hide it. =Values= It is proposed that overall life satisfaction comes from within an individual based on the individual's personal values and what he or she holds important. For some it is family, for others it is love, and for others, it is money or other material items; either way, it varies from one person to another. Economic materialism can be considered a value. Previous research found that materialistic individuals were predominantly male, and that materialistic people also reported a lower life satisfaction level than their non-materialistic counterparts. The same is true of people who value money over helping other people; this is because the money they have can buy them the assets they deem valuable.Georgellis, Yannis; Tsitsianis, Nicholas; Yin, Ya Ping, \\"Personal Values as Mitigating Factors in Link Between Income and Life Satisfaction: Evidence from the European Social Survey\\". Social Indicators Research, Vol 91(3), May, 2009. pp. 329‚Äì344. Materialistic people are less satisfied with life because they constantly want more and more belongings, and once those belongings are obtained they lose value, which in turn causes these people to want more belongings and the cycle continues. If these materialistic individuals do not have enough money to satisfy their craving for more items, they become more dissatisfied. This has been referred to as a hedonic treadmill. Individuals reporting a high value on traditions and religion reported a higher level of life satisfaction. This is also true for reported routine churchgoers and people who pray frequently. Other individuals that reported higher levels of life satisfaction were people who valued creativity, and people who valued respect for and from others ‚Äì two more qualities seemingly not related to material goods. Because hard times come around and often people count on their peers and family to help them through, it is no surprise that a higher life satisfaction level was reported of people who had social support, whether it be friends, family, or church. The people who personally valued material items were found to be less satisfied overall in life as opposed to people who attached a higher amount of value with interpersonal relationships.Wu, C., Mei, T., & Chen, L. (2009), \\"How do positive views maintain life satisfaction\\". Springer. In accordance with the findings above, it is also fair to say that the notion of how one values themselves plays a part in how someone considers their own life. People who take pride in themselves by staying mentally and physically fit have higher levels of life satisfaction purely due to the content of their day. These values come together in determining how somebody sees themselves in light of others. =Culture= Defining culture by reference to deeply engrained societal values and beliefs. Culture affects the subjective well- being. Well-being includes both general life satisfaction, and the relative balance of positive affect verses negative affect in daily life. Culture directs the attention to different sources of information for making the life satisfaction judgments, thus affecting subjective well-being appraisal. Individualistic cultures direct attention to inner states and feelings (such as positive or negative affects), while in collectivistic cultures the attention is directed to outer sources (i.e. adhering to social norms or fulfilling one's duties). Indeed, Suh et al. (1998) found that the correlation between life satisfaction and the prevalence of positive affect is higher in individualistic cultures, whereas in collectivistic cultures affect and adhering to norms are equally important for life satisfaction. Most of modern western societies, such as the United States and European countries are directed towards individualism, while the eastern societies like China and Japan, are directed towards collectivism. Those of a collectivistic culture emphasize deeply on the unity one has with their families. They put others' needs before their individual desires. An individualistic culture is geared towards one's own personal achievements and it signals a strong sense of competition. They are expected to carry their own weight and rely on themselves. The United States is said to be one of the most individualistic countries, and on the other hand Korea and Japan are some of the most collectivistic countries. However both groups have their flaws. With an individualistic approach, one is inclined in possibly experiencing loneliness. Meanwhile, those in a collectivist culture, may be prone to having a dismay of rejection. =Family= Life satisfaction can also be looked at in a new one as influenced by a family. Family life satisfaction is a pertinent topic as everyone's family influences them in some way and most strive to have high levels of satisfaction in life as well as within their own family. As discussed by Gary L. Bowen in his article, \\"Family Life Satisfaction: A Value Based Approach\\" he examines how family life satisfaction is enhanced by the ability of family members to jointly realize their family-related values in behavior (459). It is important to examine family life satisfaction from all members of the family from a \\"perceived\\" perspective and an \\"ideal\\" perspective. Research has not demonstrated that there are significant differences in life satisfaction between childless couples and couples with children. In a research study by Pollmann-Schult (2014) on 13,093 Germans, it was found that when finances and time costs are held constant, parents are happier and show increased life satisfication than non-parents. The researchers noted that their study is culture and context specific and may not generalize to other countries. In 1994, a study on a group of 408 Caucasian high school students in the southern United States suggested that adolescent life satisfaction may have different origins from the life satisfaction of adults. The adolescents' life satisfaction was heavily influenced by their family's dynamic and characteristics. Family bonding, family flexibility, parental support factored into the adolescents' life satisfaction, such that more bonding, flexibility, and support within a family correlated to some extent to a higher life satisfaction. The results of the study also indicated that within the studied population, adolescents living in a single-parent family home had significantly lower life satisfaction than adolescents in a two-parent home. The age of the adolescent was a significant factor in terms of how much of their life satisfaction derived from their family. =Career= A satisfying career is an important component of life satisfaction. Doing something meaningful in a productive capacity contributes to one's feeling of life satisfaction. This notion of accomplishment is related to a person's drive. Need for accomplishment is an essential part of becoming a fully functional person, and if someone feels accomplished they would be more able to see bright sides in their life; thus improving their life satisfaction Internationally, the salary one earns is important‚Äìincome levels show a moderate correlation with individual evaluations of life satisfaction. However, in developed nations, the connection is weak and disappears for the most part when individuals earn enough money to meet basic needs (Kahneman & Deaton 2010; Diener et al., 2010; Myers and Diener, 1995). =Social yardsticks= Daniel Kahneman has said that ‚ÄúLife satisfaction is connected to a large degree to social yardsticks‚Äìachieving goals, meeting expectations.‚Äù Relationship with subjective well-being Life satisfaction is one component of subjective well-being, along with affective balance.

Built in the early 17th century, the castle was sold to the Air Ministry in 1938. An underground bunker was constructed and the station was used to coordinate the operations of RAF Coastal Command and the Royal Navy during the Second World War. The station was subsequently used as a UK and NATO maritime headquarters before closing in 1996. It is now in residential use.  History  = Pre-military use = Pitreavie Castle is thought to have been built by Sir Henry Wardlaw, the 1st Baronet of Pitreavie, who bought the Pitreavie estate in 1608, with the castle believed to have existed by 1614. It was sold to Archibald Primrose, 1st Earl of Rosebery, in 1703, and then to Sir Robert Blackwood, Lord Dean of Guild, and later Lord Provost, of Edinburgh, in 1711. It remained in the Blackwood family for 170 years, but was unoccupied for almost a century. The castle was bought by Henry Beveridge, a wealthy mill owner, in 1884. It was extensively extended and altered in 1885. = Establishment = Before the outbreak of the Second World War, the Works Department of the Air Ministry was looking for a site to accommodate the headquarters of newly reformed No. 18 (Reconnaissance) Group, part of RAF Coastal Command. In 1938, Pitreavie Castle was found and purchased for ¬£12,306. The building, which was in a dilapidated state, was considered suitable due to the room available for expansion in its large grounds and its close proximity to the Royal Navy base at Roysth. In 1939, the Admiralty made it known to the RAF that it was interested in co-locating at Pitreavie and creating a joint RAF/Royal Navy Area Combined Headquarters (ACHQ), to which the RAF were agreeable. In order to protect the important headquarters from potential aerial attack should war break out, work began on an subterranean bunker within the grounds, located to the south-west of the main building. It comprised a two-storey bunker, square in shape, buried underground. It featured two entrances, one for the RAF, leading to an external entrance beside the main building and one leading to the newly built above ground Royal Navy block to the west. It was completed in 1941. = Second World War = WAAF teleprinter operators at work in the signals centre at RAF Pitreavie Castle during the Second World War. The site became home to the No. 18 Group headquarters, which had responsibility for maritime air operations north of Flamborough Head in Yorkshire, including the areas north and west of Scotland. The Navy's Flag Officer Rosyth was responsible for naval operations north of Flamborough Head to Wick in Caithness. The site featured a joint Officers' Mess and a steading to the east of the main building was used as a Sergeants' Mess. Towards the end of Second World War, three wooden huts were located to the east of the main building and used to accommodate officers, non- commissioned Officers and other ranks and ratings. The huts were believed to have dated from the First World War and had been relocated from RAF Donibristle, approximately away at Dalgety Bay. During the war, No. 18 Group had responsibility for more than twenty squadrons and controlled aircraft predominately involved in anti-shipping and anti-submarine warfare in the seas around Scotland. The Prime Minister Winston Churchill, visited Pitreavie Castle twice during the war. = Cold War = Pitreavie Castle in 2011 After the end of the Second World War in 1945, Pitreavie Castle's peacetime role continued to be maritime coordination. However, Flag Officer Rosyth transitioned into the Flag Officer Scotland position. On the formation of the NATO alliance in April 1949, both the Flag Officer Scotland and Air Officer Scotland positions became dually-appointed, taking on NATO command roles. An associated Royal Naval Reserve unit was commissioned in 1957, later being named HMS Scotia in 1960. Initially based in the Maritime Headquarters, it was relocated to an above ground building in 1962. In 1963, following a review of Royal Navy and RAF headquarters sites, the bunker was rearranged and enlarged. After Fleet Headquarters based at Northwood Headquarters (HMS Warrior) in Hertfordshire, Pitreavie became the second most important naval headquarters in the UK, although it remained as a joint Royal Navy/RAF operation. During the mid-1970s the number of Royal Navy personnel increased whereas the level of RAF personnel reduced. A limited number of married quarters were provided at Pitreavie, however most personnel were accommodated at Rosyth Dockyard (HMS Cochrane) or RAF Turnhouse near Edinburgh. During the Cold War, Pitreavie Castle had several administrative and command roles.  Administration  The station was home to the administrative offices of the senior Royal Navy and RAF officers in Scotland. Flag Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland (FOSNI) had offices in A-block and Air Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland (AOSNI) had offices in the main castle building.  Maritime Headquarters  left Pitreavie had command and control of Royal Navy warships and auxiliary vessels (apart from submarines) and RAF maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) in the seas around Scotland, Northern Ireland and Northern England. During peacetime operations would include training exercises and routine patrols. The station was often used as the base for coordinating Joint Maritime Course exercises. Had war broken out with the Soviet Union, the station would have taken command and control of NATO vessels and MPA in its allocated areas. Pitreavie could also, if required, take over the functions of Northwood Headquarters. In these circumstances Pitreavie would take on a wider area of responsibility, have increased contact with politicians, co-ordinate submarines, and after 1970, control Polaris, the UK's strategic nuclear deterrent.  Rescue Co-ordination Centre  The Search and Rescue (SAR) cell, known as Rescue Co-ordination Centre (RCC) Edinburgh, controlled Royal Navy and RAF aircraft taking part in rescues over both land and sea in Scotland, Northern Ireland and most of England. = Draw-down and closure = During the early 1990s, RAF Pitreavie Castle's future looked secure with plans announced in July 1993 to locate a combined national Rescue Co-ordination Centre (RCC) at the site. The combined RCC would have coordinated all military aircraft involved in military and civilian search and rescue operations in the UK. The plans would have seen the closure of the UK's other RCC, which was located at Mount Wise in Plymouth. The national RCC was expected to be operational by the end of 1994. However, Frontline First: The Defence Costs Study', published by the Ministry of Defence in July 1994, recommended various changes to the structure of the British military and the defence estate. The study resulted in Pitreavie's roles being relocated and the station proposed for closure. The creation of the national RCC at Pitrevie was cancelled, with a new home for it proposed at RAF Leuchars, also in Fife. In the event, the national RCC was established in 1997 at RAF Kinloss in Moray and became known as the Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre (ARCC). In December 1995, the office of the Air Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland moved from Pitreavie Castle to RAF Leuchars. Flag Officer Scotland Northern England and Northern Ireland moved to Faslane (HMNB Cylde). RAF Pitreavie Castle closed on 31 January 1996. The closure of the station was expected to save ¬£22 million over 10 years. = Post-military use = After the closure of the station the castle and former steading buildings were converted to residential use. Other buildings were demolished and the bunker sealed up, with all surface elements removed.

She was born in Lyon on 6 September 1761. Marie- Gabrielle came from a modest background and her previous background and artistic training is unknown, but in 1781 she became the pupil of the French painter Adelaide Labille-Guiard in Paris. She excelled as a portrait painter, and her works include oil paintings, watercolours and miniatures. Life Labille-Guiard, Self-Portrait with Two Pupils. The pupils are Marie-Gabrielle Capet and Marie-Marguerite Carreaux de Rosemond Marie-Gabrielle Capet, by Labille-Guiard Marie-Gabrielle Capet was born at Lyon in 1761.For a complete monograph on Capet's life, see Arnauld Doria, Gabrielle Capet, Paris: Les Beaux-Arts, 1934. In eighteenth-century France, the Royal Academy of Art was responsible for training artists and exhibiting artworks at the Salon that glorified heroic values promoted by the Bourbon monarchy. Until the French Revolution, the Royal Academy of Art in Paris was the central institution for official artistic practice, and limited its number of female students to four at a time.Laura Auricchio, \\"Self-Promotion in Ad√©la√Øde Labille-Guiard's 1785 \\"Self Portrait with Two Students\\", The Art Bulletin, Vol. 89, No. 1 (March 2007) In 1781, twenty-year-old Capet moved to Paris to become the student of Ad√©la√Øde Labille-Guiard (1749‚Äì1803), a Neoclassical artist who was admitted to the Academy in 1783. Capet showed her early work at the Exposition de la jeunesse, and later exhibited at the Salon when it was opened to all artists after the French Revolution. Her body of work included miniature paintings, oil paintings, and pastels, which were praised for their virtuoso draftsmanship and use of color.Delia Gaze, \\"Capet, Gabrielle\\", Dictionary of Women Artists (1997: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers) Many of her pastel paintings were portraits, though by 1808 she was regarded as a history painter in her own right.Charles Landon \\"Salon de 1808\\", Journal des Arts, des Sciences, et de Litt√©rature, no. 170. 10 Frimaire an 10, p. 65.Heller, Nancy G., Women Artists: An Illustrated History, Abbeville Press, Publishers, New York 1987 She counted among other customers several members of the royal family, and other members of Paris society, such as the lawyer Pierre-Nicolas Berryer and the playwright Joseph Ch√©nier. Capet and Labille-Guiard not only enjoyed a professional relationship, but were also close family friends. Capet would move in with her teacher at the Louvre until Labille-Guiard's death. Even after Ad√©la√Øde Labille-Guiard married the painter Fran√ßois Vincent in 1799, Capet continued to live in their home. Among her works the best known are those of Mesdames Adelaide and Victoire, Madame Vincent surrounded by her pupils, Mlle. Mars, and Jean-Antoine Houdon. At that time the Academy had limited the members of women painters to only four woman members. She died in Paris in 1818.  Works  The work of Marie-Gabrielle Capet contains a large collection of miniature portraits, the majority of which are housed in The Louvre. Included in this collection are portraits of Madame Martin de Lesseps, Madame Elisabeth, sister of Louis XVI, and Mademoiselle Mars.

He owned an estate in Ossington, Nottinghamshire where he held several local offices as well as sitting in the House of Commons from 1874 to 1880.  Early life  Denison was the eldest son of Sir William T. Denison (1804‚Äì71), a British colonial governor and brother of Speaker Evelyn Denison. His mother was Caroline n√©e Hornby, daughter of Admiral Sir Phipps Hornby. At the age of 3 he moved to Van Diemen's Land, where his father had been appointed Lieutenant- Governor. In 1854 Sir William was promoted to Governor of New South Wales, and the family moved to Sydney. William was educated at Eton and then at the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich. In February 1864 he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, and in September 1876 he was promoted to the rank of captain. He retired from the Royal Artillery in 1878.  Political career  Denison was elected at the 1874 general election as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham, when the Conservatives took both the city's parliamentary seats from the Liberals. Denison did not stand again in Nottingham at the 1880 general election, having been asked instead to contest the Northern division of Nottinghamshire, where he was unsuccessful.Craig, page 439 He was appointed as Deputy Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire in March 1875. He was nominated as a High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in November 1892, and again in November 1894, and appointed to the post in March 1895. Denison was also a county magistrate (Justice of the Peace), chairman of the bench of magistrates at Newark, and an Alderman of Nottinghamshire County Council.  Cricket  Denison was a member of the Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club, of which he was President in 1891. The following year he was President of the Marylebone Cricket Club.  Residence  When his uncle Viscount Ossington died childless in 1873, Denison inherited the Ossington Hall estate. On his own death in 1916, the estates passed to his son William Frank Evelyn Denison, who died two years later, when the estates reverted to Lady Elinor Denison, widow of W.E Denison.

He was a Fellow of the Royal Philatelic Society London. Early life Samuel began collecting specimen stamps in 1924 when his father acquired a collection which contained many specimens. He was allowed to keep the specimens in return for removing the other stamps from the album. He subsequently formed a comprehensive collection of specimen stamps at a time when few other collectors were interested in them. Dealers were pleased to sell him their unwanted stamps and one was quoted as saying \\"The trouble with Marcus is that all his stamps are overprinted specimen\\".

Early life and education Orme was born December 14, 1953 in Boston, Massachusetts. Orme grew up in Ogden, Utah, and later attended Robert E. Lee High School in San Antonio, Texas. He graduated from the University of Utah in 1975 with a degree in Political Science and a Certificate in International Relations. He then attended law school at George Washington University. While in Washington, D.C., Orme worked for the United States Agency for International Development in the Office of General Counsel. He received his Juris Doctor, with high honors, in 1978. Early legal career After graduating law school, Orme began working at the Salt Lake City law firm of Van Cott, Bagley, Cornwall and McCarthy in the Summer of 1978. In September 1978, he took a leave of absence to serve as a law clerk under Judge Monroe G. McKay, a Federal Appeals Court Judge on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. In August 1979 Orme finished his clerkship and returned to work at Van Cott. He worked primarily in commercial litigation, handling cases for clients such as Deer Valley Resort, Jackson Hole Ski Corporation, Huntsman Chemical, and KeyBank. Orme was made a partner at the firm in 1984. He was a recipient of the Utah State Bar's Young Lawyer of the Year award in 1986. Nomination and appointment In 1984, voters approved an amendment to Article VIII of the Utah State Constitution. Following this amendment, a task force was created to develop solutions to many of the problems facing the judiciary. The Utah Court of Appeals was conceived to address the burdensome delays in the appellate process.William C. Vickrey, Timothy M. Shea, House Bill 100 and the Utah Court of Appeals: A Blueprint for Judicial Reform, Utah State Bar Journal (Fall-Winter 1985) In late 1986, Orme applied for a position on the soon to be formed court. He was one of seven selected by Governor Norman H. Bangerter from the 21 names forwarded to him by the state's Judicial Nominating Commission. Orme was confirmed by the State Senate and was sworn in by Chief Justice of the Utah Supreme Court, Gordon R. Hall, on January 18, 1987.Salt Lake Tribune, January 18th, 1987, B1-B2 Judge Orme and the other six original members of the court then began to handle both cases that had been waiting for years to be argued, as well as new appeals from trial courts and administrative agencies. In a 2007 article in the Utah Bar Journal, Orme gave his perspective on the twenty-year history of the Court of Appeals, and the difficulties surmounted in developing an efficient appellate system for the state of Utah. Judicial career Judge Orme served as Presiding Judge for the Court of Appeals from 1995-1996. He was elected to the Judicial Council representing the Court of Appeals in 1986 and served two terms. He served six years on the Ethics Advisory Committee, and ten years on the Judicial Performance Evaluation Committee. Orme is the judicial advisor to the Utah Bar Journal and has made numerous written contributions to it, particularly with regard to professionalism and the behavior expected of lawyers. He is also a member of the executive committee of the Utah State Bar's Appellate Practice Section. He was made a fellow of the American Bar Foundation in 2005. In 2007, he received the Utah Bar's Judge of the Year award. Having been elected in 2007 and again in 2010, he again sits on the Judicial Council as the Court of Appeals representative. He also serves on the Utah Supreme Court's Advisory Committee on the Rules of Appellate Procedure, the Advisory Committee on Professionalism (formed in 2002) and the Utah Sentencing Commission. He is the only original member of the court who still serves on it. =Significant opinions= In re M.B., 198 P.3d 1007 (UT Ct. App. 2008) State ex rel M.B., 198 P3d 1007, (Ut. Ct. App. 2008) https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ut-court-of- appeals/1425064.html M. B. was convicted of the crimes of vehicular burglary, theft, and unlawful possession of burglary tools. He appealed his convictions which grew out of a 2007 incident in which two men broke into a truck and stole the stereo and compact discs inside. At that time M.B. was sitting in the getaway vehicle across the street from the driveway the truck was parked in. The owner of the truck awoke to see the men exiting the car with the stereo and saw M.B. sitting in the getaway car. The police were notified and the men were caught a short time later. M.B. argued that his conviction should be overturned because no evidence was submitted that implicated M.B. as actively encouraging or intentionally aiding the two men in the commission of the crime. M.B.'s counsel also argued that the charge of unlawful possession of burglary tools should be dismissed because they were located within the vehicle, and since the vehicle had other occupants, there was reasonable doubt as to whether M.B. constructively possessed the screwdriver and gloves found inside the getaway vehicle. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision. B.A.M. v. Salt Lake County, 87 P.3d 710 (UT Ct. App. 2004)B.A.M. v. Salt Lake County, 87 P3d 710, (Ut. Ct. App. 2004) http://www1.co.weber.ut.us/surveyor/S-LS-Data/Survey-laws/Cases/bam022004.htm B.A.M. had dedicated a plot of land to be developed, and the Salt Lake County Planning and Zoning Commission approved the preliminary plans. However, a year later, the Commission demanded an additional 13 feet of land to be dedicated to the subdivision to make room for future road expansion. The plaintiff objected to this new demand as an unconstitutional taking without compensation by the government. Plaintiff sued in district court and lost, and then appealed. The court of appeals found the trial court to be in error, and reversed and remanded the prior decision. Judge Orme wrote a dissenting opinion in this case. Orme argued that because the Zoning Commission was not a judicial body, and no record was created, the trial court did in fact have authority to take evidence and call witnesses, contrary to the majority opinion. He then further argued that the imposition of an additional 13-foot dedication of land was in fact an unconstitutional taking and the plaintiff was entitled to just compensation. In the final paragraph, Judge Orme criticized the plaintiff's counsel's use of exaggerated punctuation in the submitted brief. This comment won attention from the press and was mentioned in the New York Times. This case was granted writ of certiorari to the Utah Supreme Court, which, in a manner almost entirely consistent with Judge Orme's dissent, affirmed the court of appeals decision in part while reversing in part.\\"B.A.M. v. Salt Lake County, 128 P3d 1161, (Ut. Sup. Ct. 2006) State v. Chavez, 41 P.3d 1137 (UT Ct. App. 2002)State of Utah v. Chavez, 41 P3d 1137, 2002 (Ut. Ct. App. 2002) https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ut-court-of- appeals/1297018.html Chavez was convicted of attempted rape of a child based on the testimony of the victim and another witness, Joseph Young. Young gave testimony that Chavez confessed to the crime while they were both in jail. In cross examination, defense counsel discovered that Young was already incarcerated, was a Drug Enforcement Administration informant at the time, and had served as a police informant at least twenty times prior to this occasion. He was also convicted of numerous felonies involving dishonesty. The trial court prohibited the defense from asking any questions about his current incarceration or about his work for the DEA. The appellant argued that allowing the witness to testify while restricting the questions that the defense could ask was a violation of the constitutional right to confront one's accusers. Judge Orme wrote the unanimous opinion for the court. The court determined that because the prosecution had no physical evidence to prove the crime, and relied solely on the testimony of the witnesses, the credibility of the witnesses had to be examined. Because the victim gave inconsistent statements to police and to the court, Young's testimony may have been the integral component in convicting Chavez. The restriction on cross- examination of Young was ruled to be prejudicial and the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. State v. Wanosik, 31 P3d 615 (UT Ct. App. 2001)State of Utah v. Wanosik, 31 P3d 615, 2001 (Ut. Ct. App. 2001) http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/appopin/wanosik.htm Wanosik plead guilty to two misdemeanor drug offenses, but failed to appear at sentencing. He filed an appeal arguing that the sentencing should not have taken place in his absence and that the trial court erred in sentencing him. The Court of Appeals ruled that Wanosik had no basis to expect the trial court not to proceed in his absence after the court had informed him of the date and time of sentencing. However, the trial court did fail to hear any information relevant to sentencing from either the defense counsel or the prosecutor, and therefore violated Wanosik's Due Process rights in failing to base its sentencing decisions on information presented to it. The Court of Appeals vacated the sentences, and remanded for resentencing. The state appealed to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the Court of Appeals decision.State of Utah v. Wanosik, 79 P3d 937, (Ut. Sup. Ct. 2003) State v. Singer, 815 P.2d 1303 (UT Ct. App. 1991)State of Utah v. Singer, 815 P2d 1303, 1991 (Ut. Ct. App. 1991) John Timothy Singer, son of John Singer, was convicted of manslaughter in the killing of Lt. Fred House of the Utah Department of Corrections. Singer appealed with a claim that evidence against him only supported a conviction of the lesser offense of negligent homicide, as well as that his Fifth Amendment rights had been violated by the officers who had arrested him. Singer argued that he had been firing in the direction of the police dogs, and had not intended to strike the human handler. Evidence from the siege of the Singer residence indicated that during the thirteen-day ordeal, it would have become very obvious to Singer that officers were present and had taken up positions in nearby residences. The court ruled that the jury's determination that Singer had acted recklessly in firing his rifle was correct, and affirmed the conviction for manslaughter. The second argument was that the arresting officers had behaved in a manipulative fashion to elicit incriminating statements from Singer once he was in custody. After being taken into custody, he was driven by two Federal ATF agents to Salt Lake City. He had signed a waiver that he understood his rights, and as he was being questioned, he expressed his desire to not discuss the siege or the bombing for which his brother-in-law, Addam Swapp, was responsible. The agents ceased questioning him and began discussing between themselves their families and desires to return home after the long assignment. Singer then joined the conversation and offered details about his own family and the agents resumed questioning him without restating his Miranda rights. The argument that the agents had begun discussing their families to exploit a weakness in Singer was rejected by the court, which found that the discussion between the agents was not unusual after both had spent a long time away from their homes in different states. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress Singer's testimony.

He was eventually defeated by Raden Wijaya, Kertanegara's son-in-law using the troops of the Mongol Yuan dynasty that were invading Java. Raden Wijaya would later turn against the Mongols and found Majapahit, the greatest empire in Java. Background Since 1271, Jayakatwang was viceroy (or governor) of Kediri, a vassal state of Singhasari. Kediri was formerly the dominant kingdom in Java until overthrown in 1222 by Ken Arok, the first king of Singhasari. Jayakatwang was probably a descendant of the Kediri royal line, and thus held ambition to restore his line to power and rulership of Java. His name is derived from Sanskrit Jaya (victory) and Javanese ketawang, (rising, or appearing). Kediri is located in fertile rice- producing area in Brantas River banks, approximately 80 km to the west of Singhasari, but separated from it by the Arjuno-Welirang volcanoes and Mount Kawi.  Rebellion against Singhasari  Kertanegara, the fifth ruler of Singhasari, was an ambitious man. In 1289, Mongol emissary came to Java to demand his submission to the Great Khan of the Yuan dynasty. Kertanegara rejected, cut their ears and sent them back to China. Anticipating Mongolian revenge, he prepared to thwart the forthcoming invasion by conquering important ports and kingdoms in Maritime Southeast Asia. His most important expedition was the Pamalayu expedition to Sumatra in 1292, where he sent the Javanese army to conquer Sumatra from various successor states of Srivijaya. With the bulk of the Javanese army overseas, Jayakatwang seized his chance and launched a coup against Singhasari. He launched a diversionary attack to the northern Java, where his troops drew the remaining Singhasari troops left in the island. With Singhasari defenseless he attacked the capital city. Kertanegara was killed in his palace. Jayakatwang then declared himself ruler of Java and king of the restored Kediri. Among few surviving relatives of Kertanegara was Raden Wijaya, who fled to Madura where he was sheltered by its regent, Arya Wiraraja. Following Wiraraja's plea, Jayakatwang pardoned Wijaya, who in return submitted himself to Jayakatwang. Jayakatwang gave Wijaya land in the Tarik forest in Brantas delta, to build a village that was later called Majapahit, named from the sour beal tree that grow in the area.  Mongol invasion  Mongol expedition of the Yuan dynasty sent by Kublai Khan finally arrived in Java. Sailing from Quanzhou, and after journey from China through Champa and Karimata, landing at the port of Tuban in early 1293. Raden Wijaya seeing this event as opportunity to revenge Kertanegara's death and claim the throne of Java. He soon offered submission and allied himself with the Mongol, who wasn't aware on the recent political change in Java. The Mongolian expedition consisted of 20.000 army with 1.000 boats and a year of grain provision. The expedition consisted mostly of southern Chinese conscript. They arrived at port of Tuban and soon preparing their fleet to enter the rivers of Java. With Wijaya as guide, Mongol troop declared war against Jayakatwang. Wijaya's and his Mongol allies defeated captured Jayakatwang's navy in Surabaya at delta of Brantas river. Following the victory they easily marched along Brantas to Kediri in Java's interior. After heavy fight, they besieged and conquered Kediri. Jayakatwang was captured and then executed, in March 1293. Thus the troops sent to Java that with the intention to punish the king who insulted the Mongols (Kertanegara), ended up revenging his death and killing his usurper (Jayakatwang).  Legacy  Jayakatwang's restoration of Kediri was short-lived, but the event that happened during his reign played important part in the history of Java and Indonesia, especially in the rise of Majapahit under Raden Wijaya. In disguise of returning to his domain in Majapahit to prepare tribute for the Mongol, Raden Wijaya would go on to betray his Mongol allies, who were exhausted after the war with Jayakatwang. He would drive them from Java and establishing Majapahit as the one of the greatest empire that rise from modern territory of Indonesia.

The members include: Sally Holliday (vocals/songwriter), Dan Leddy (guitars/vocals) and Kev Wilson (bass/vocals) The full line-up of Hanging Doll took form after Dan, (a classically trained guitarist with a degree in classical music) and Alex Cooper, who had been working together since 2002, invited Sally, a professional photographer, to take pictures of an early version of the band in 2004 (Alex, Dan, Kev and the original vocalist Emily Brownhill). After Emily quit shortly afterwards, Sally was invited to audition and recruited to fill the position. Aryan Amoli was brought into the fold on keyboards about a year later. Hanging Doll made a name for themselves in the Birmingham, West Midlands rock scene with their (official) debut album Reason & Madness. Sally Holliday‚Äôs silky, sweeping voice soars above glorious classical power metal guitar solos, haunting gothic keyboards and a massive, crunching rhythm section, effortlessly creating an irresistible British gothic rock concoction. Hanging Doll were signed to Rocksector Records in early 2012 and announced they would release their third studio album (second official release), The Sacred & Profane on 30 April 2012, with the first music video for the track \\"Carnival Of Sin\\" having already been released on 22 February of the same year. However the release of The Sacred & Profane was delayed and was released on 3 September. The previous album Reason & Madness was released on the record label Phoenix Music [UK] Ltd / Cargo Records. Hanging Doll are currently working on new material for their third official album release. Hanging Doll reform On 19 April 2014 the band announced on their Facebook page, that Alex Cooper and Aryan Amoli were leaving the band (on good terms) after the band went through an unfortunate event with a management company. The remaining members tried to keep things going but struggled to find the right people to get back on track. On 5 July 2014 Sally's letter was published on the band's Facebook-page, saying that Hanging Doll were no more. Sally, Dan and Kev have since had a boost from a new management company and are working on new material for a new album.

Biography and career Hasan Tahsin was an Albanian, sometimes confused with Tahsin Pasha, born in Mesare (located in Albania on the border with Greece), which at the time was part of the kaza of Leskovik. During his youth, he attended and graduated from the Greek Zosimaia School at Ioannina, and spoke Greek fluently. He began service as a gendarme ca. 1870 in Katerini, and later joined the Ottoman Army as an NCO. He soon received a commission as an officer, and by 1881 he commanded the Ottoman Gendarmerie at Ioannina. During the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, he commanded the 6th Trabzon Division, and around 1900, he was placed as garrison commander of Thessaloniki. In 1908‚Äì1910, he served as the governor of Yemen before returning to Thessaloniki, where he assumed the post of commanding officer of the III Corps with the rank of Ferik (Lieutenant General). After his retirement in 1912, he was persuaded to return to duty as governor-general of the Ioannina Vilayet. As tensions with the Balkan League grew however over the summer of 1912, he was switched to command the VIII Provisional Corps at Thessaloniki. After the outbreak of the First Balkan War, he led his forces against the Greek Army of Thessaly under Crown Prince Constantine. The Greek army, better prepared and outnumbering his own forces, defeated VIII Corps in the battles of Sarantaporo and Yenidje. Surrounded and blockaded in Thessaloniki and with no hope of outside succor, and learning of the approach of the 7th Bulgarian Division from the northeast, Hasan Tahsin resolved to surrender the Thessaloniki fortress and his 26,000 men to the Greeks. After a few days of negotiations, a surrender protocol was signed on , with the handover carried out the next day. The Ottoman side immediately considered him a traitor and a court martial gave a death sentence.  Exile  The surrender of Hasan Tahsin Pasha After his release from Greek captivity, he went into exile, first in France and later in Switzerland. He died in Lausanne in 1918 and was buried there. In 1937, his remains were transferred to the Albanian cemetery of Thessaloniki, and in 2006 to the Military Cemetery of the Balkan Wars at Gefyra. Out of his seven children only three lived long lives, two sons and a daughter who got married in Turkey. One of his sons, Kenan Messare (1889‚Äì1965), who was his adjutant during the war, became a Greek citizen and a notable painter, known especially for his scenes of battles from the Balkan Wars. The other son Qemal Messare moved to Albania, worked as a functionary in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in King Zog's Residence, and was appointed Ambassador to Greece on January 1933, where he served until 1934.

The film is based on Park Heung-yong's graphic novel Like the Moon Escaping from the Clouds.  Plot  In the late 16th century, the kingdom of Joseon is thrown into chaos by the threat of a Japanese invasion. Lee Mong-hak (Cha Seung-won), an illegitimate offspring from a cadet family of the ruling dynasty, and legendary blind swordsman Hwang Jeong-hak (Hwang Jung-min) were once allies who dreamed of stamping out the Japanese invasion, social inequality and corruption, and creating a better world. Persecuted by the court, Lee forms a rebel army in hopes of overthrowing the inept king and taking the throne himself. Lee is willing to kill recklessly and betray former comrades to forge his bloody path to the palace. Kyeon-ja is the bastard child of a family killed by Mong-hak. Hwang Jeong-hak saves him from an injury caused by Mong- hak. Together the two search for Mong-hak in order to confront and kill him. After Mong-hak's Great Alliance rebel army defeat a large government military force, Hwang Jeong-hak confronts him alone. After a lengthy battle, Mong-hak's skill proves too much and the blind swordsman falls. Kyeon-ja, finding Jeong- hak dead, decides to head to Seoul, the capital of Joseon and final destination of Mong-hak. While, Mong-hak, despite finding out that Japanese forces are approaching and will slaughter and pillage every villagers and settlements they encounter, orders the Great Alliance army to press on towards to Seoul, abandoning the commoners who gathered to rebel camp seeking protection from invading forces. The rebels take Seoul, but are confused and frustrated as the king has already abandoned the capital and the palace lies forlorn. Kyeon-ja, who has arrived at the palace before the rebels came, confronts Mong-hak as he approaches the throne pavilion. A few moments later the Japanese army arrives and begins massacring the rebel army with their arquebuses. Kyeon-ja succeeds in killing Mong-hak then dies at the hands of the Japanese army.

But he decided against a full-time cricket career and became a schoolmaster. He was born in Parramatta, Sydney, Australia. Life and career Though born in Australia, Dickinson was educated in England at Blackburn Grammar School and Manchester University, where he gained a BSc in Maths. A right-arm fast-medium bowler and a left-handed tail-end batsman, he played Lancashire League cricket for East Lancashire from the age of 15 and made his first-class debut for Lancashire as a 19-year-old in 1950, playing as an amateur.Wisden 1951, p. 399. Such was the dominance of Lancashire's spin attack of Roy Tattersall, Bob Berry, Malcolm Hilton and Peter Greenwood that Dickinson bowled only 56 overs in his four matches for the side in 1950 and 1951, never taking more than one wicket in any innings. In the mid-1950s, he turned out for The Army in non-first-class matches. He was appointed Head of Maths at Queen's College, Taunton. During the summer holidays in August 1957 he played in five consecutive matches for Somerset. In his first match, against Glamorgan, he took five wickets for 36 in the first innings, sharing all 10 wickets in the innings with Bryan Lobb, who took five for 63. In the following match, he was again Somerset's most successful bowler against a full-strength Surrey side heading for its sixth consecutive County Championship: he took four for 80, though Surrey won the match. But after taking 17 wickets at an average of less than 20 runs per wicket, he did not appear in first-class matches again, though he played for Somerset's second eleven in Minor Counties matches in the school holidays in 1958. Dickinson's batting was negligible, and in nine first-class matches he did not ever reach double figures. The Somerset historian David Foot, however, remembers his batting style: \\"More than once I saw him switch from left to right hand in the middle of an over - not to attempt the contentious reverse sweep but to deceive the fielders and show he could play the cover drive on both sides,\\" he wrote. \\"They used to say he could also bowl with either hand.\\" He taught at Queen's College for 29 years before retiring to Nottinghamshire.

The firm was founded by James Shepherd Morris (1931‚Äì2006) and Robert Russell Steedman (born 1929) in the 1950s. The pair are best known for their private houses in the modernist style, built during the 1950s and 1960s, described as \\"arguably the most important series of 20th century houses by a single practice in Scotland\\".Architects Volume 1, page 3 Both founders retired in 2002, although their practice continues as Morris and Steedman Associates. Several of their buildings are now listed, and seven of their works were included on the list of 100 best modern Scottish buildings published by Prospect magazine in 2005. Architects James Morris met Robert Steedman while the two were studying together at Edinburgh College of Art (ECA). Encouraged by their tutor, Ian McHarg, the two went on to complete a Master of Liberal Arts course in landscape architecture at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Here, under the guidance of Philip Johnson, they absorbed the ideas of architects such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Marcel Breuer, Richard Neutra, and the \\"Case Study Houses\\" of California.Green, Simon. \\"Early private houses\\", in Morris and Steedman: Clarity of intent. pp.4‚Äì5 Both architects were elected associates of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1955; they joined in partnership, based in Edinburgh in 1957. Buildings They obtained their first commission from Steedman's dentist in 1952, while still in their final year at ECA. The resulting house, \\"Avisfield\\", at Cramond (1957) was listed at category B in 2007, as \\"one of the first modern-movement houses to be built in Scotland\\". Their second house, at Kevock Road, Lasswade, was built on a narrow site above the River North Esk. The narrow site required the building to be cantilevered over the slope. The Sillito House on Blackford Hill followed in 1959, with the main living space placed on the first floor to take advantage of views across Edinburgh. By 1970 around 15 houses had been completed, including Morris' own house at Fala (1970), and Steedman's in Ravelston (1960), as well as the Principal's House at the University of Stirling (1967), which was listed at category A in 2009. A full list of Morris and Steedman clients and projects is available from the successor practice's website. Although best known and celebrated for their early private houses, this list demonstrates the wide range of clients Morris and Steedman and their successor practice worked for over the years and the diversity of types of projects undertaken. Perhaps one of the best known of their education projects is the B-listed Wolfson Centre for Bioengineering (1969‚Äì72), the University of Strathclyde, situated at Taylor Street (106 Rottenrow), Glasgow. This five-storey building, including laboratories and teaching spaces, has full-height ribbed chevron-shaped concrete cladding panels and is a prominent landmark on the campus. According to the listing, services were integrated into the architecture and housed in the chevron cladding. Another example of Brutalist Modernist work is the University of Edinburgh Student Centre at Potterrow, actually built in phases and originally including 6 & 7 Bristo Square as well as the current student union facilities at 1-5 Bristo Square; the dome at Potterrow was phase III (1966‚Äì73). In 2009 the University of Edinburgh contributed to a master plan published by the city council suggesting these buildings are likely to be removed. However, the buildings at 7 Bristo Square have been refurbished and extended by the University of Edinburgh at a cost of ¬£8m to form a Wellbeing Centre (2018-2020). The Countryside Commission for Scotland (now Scottish Natural Heritage) centre at Battleby, Perth (1971), was by contrast a conservation project and involved rebuilding a ruined farmstead. This project was awarded a RIBA award in 1974 and a Civic Trust Award in 1975.

Ba Gyan's cartoons covered a wide variety of topics and events, and ridiculed human frailties such as discourtesy, dishonesty, snobbery, arrogance, inefficiency and sloth. Ba Gyan was born in 1902 at Nyaungdon, the son of a silk merchant. He was admitted to Yangon College in 1924, and the University magazine included his first cartoon in 1926. After that, his work began to appear in several journals, including the Phauk Seit cartoon in the Thuriya newspaper. He also drew Magazine covers and water colour paintings, and wrote novels under the pen name Thonnya, meaning zero. He created the cartoon films Kyetaungwa in 1934 and Athuya in 1935, working with cartoonist Hein Son. Ba Gyan's 1937 comic book Ko Pyoo and Ma Pyone was the first Myanmar comic for young people. He pioneered the crucial role of news cartoons in newspapers such as The Botataung, The Mirror and Myanma Alin. After the war, his Zayakati cartoon appeared in the Hanthawaddy newspaper. During a drive to stamp out corruption in the post-independence period, he collaborated with Ngwe Gaing to produce a series of powerful and effective posters. It is said that after the death of his wife around 1948, his cartoon character \\"Hpyauk Seik\\" began to appear in the garb of a holy mendicant, reflecting his sorrow. But he continued to produce the cartoon. Ba Gyan won the Alinka Kyawswa award for his artistic skill. He used to hold a cartoon show on 13th street, where he lived, each year during Tazaungdaing festival, a custom that was continued after his death by his pupils such as cartoonist Pe Thein. Although the annual show was later abandoned, it was revived in 2010. In June 2002, an exhibition of his cartoons was staged at the meeting hall of Myanmar Traditional Artists and Artisans in Yangon, with speakers talking about his work, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of his birth. The celebration included a competition for modern Burmese cartoonists.

The school is located in facilities historically accommodated by the army, but along with many others nationally, the regiment was closed during the early 20th century. The school offers two programs of education: the Social Scientific, and the Natural Scientific. Both programs are theoretical and offer the students a vast selection of possible colleges and universities for future studies. Frida High is famous for its policy of student self-responsibility. This is demonstrated by much scheduled individual study time, which allows the students to finish assignments they may have, or to book meetings with teachers to discuss their progress, etc. The students are also supplied with a Macbook, which is a tool of study as opposed to books and leaflets. The majority of all school works are handed in digitally, and written-form hand-ins are rare.

The ICA was one of the first acts of Brian Mulroney's newly elected Progressive Conservative government, receiving royal assent on 20 June 1985. It has been amended at various times, including recently the Economic Action Plan 2013 Act.\\"Economic Action Plan 2013 Act\\", No. 1, SC 2013, c 33 Pertinent regulations include the Investment Canada Regulations, SOR/85-611.Investment Canada Regulations, SOR/85-611 The Act empowers the government to forbid foreign investments of \\"significant\\" size if they do not present a \\"net benefit to Canada.\\" As of 2017, Canadian policy is to consider over $1 billion \\"significant.\\" The determination of what substantially constitutes the locus of control of a corporation is governed by the Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Act.\\"Canadian Ownership and Control Determination Act\\", RSC 1985, c C-20  History  The Act was intended to signal Canada's openness to foreign investment and coincided with a narrowed mandate of the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA), which was renamed Investment Canada. FIRA had been set up by Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to limit increasing US ownership of Canadian business.\\"The impact of government policies on foreign direct investment: the Canadian experience.\\" Article from: Journal of International Business Studies, 22 Sep 1999 by Steven Globerman and Daniel M Shapiro Canadian nationalists criticized FIRA's effectiveness, noting that in practice it was rarely used to actually forbid an investment.\\"FIRA: Instrument of Regulation or Vote-Maximization\\"; Pauwels, Jacques R. 23 Osgoode Hall L. J. 131 (1985) The business community and opposition Progressive Conservative Party criticized FIRA for its activism, saying it had stifled investment from the emerging global economy.  Effects  All transactions that are acquisitions of a Canadian business by non-Canadians must be \\"notified\\" (ICA ss. 11-12), but only those above a 5 million dollar threshold (or 50 million dollars for indirect investments, such as shares) are reviewable (ICA s. 14). If the investor is a WTO member, the threshold was 320 million in 2012. World Trade Organization membership shown in dark green. The Act empowers a Director of Investments, who as of April 2015 is Deputy Minister of Industry John Knubley,ic.gc.ca: \\"Investment Canada Act - Investment Review Division Personnel\\"ic.gc.ca: \\"About Us - Deputy Minister\\" to produce decisions, and reports of decisions.ic.gc.ca: \\"Investment Canada Act - Annual Reports\\" The thresholds, for valuations above which the ICA is to be invoked, are (according to the legislation) several and hinge on whether or not the investors are part of the World Trade Organization.ic.gc.ca: \\"Investment Canada Act - Thresholds for Review\\" While the ICA gives Investment Canada the power to restrict investment, its mandate is only to \\"review...significant investments...in a manner that encourages investment, economic growth and employment opportunities\\" unless proposed investments specifically injure national security.ic.gc.ca: \\"\\" ic.gc.ca: \\"Investment Canada Act\\", on archive.org According to labour economist Jim Stanford, the Mulroney government never invoked the Act to deter a foreign investment, nor did its successors, the Chr√©tien and Martin Liberal governments.rabble.ca: \\"The pros and cons of foreign investment\\" by Jim Stanford, 12 Nov 2010 Foreign investment in Canada rose significantly in the wake of the ICA, from approximately $100 billion in 1985 to over $550 billion in 2006.Trade Policy Review 2010, Ch. 9: \\"Canadian Inward and Outward Direct Investment: Assessing the Impacts\\", S Rao, M Souare and W Wang (see page 319)Office of the Chief Economist - \\"Foreign Direct Investment Statistics\\" The ICA was invoked for the first time when in 2008 the Conservative government of Stephen Harper blocked the sale of the space division of MacDonald, Dettwiler & Associates, a Vancouver-area technology company, to US-based Alliant Techsystems.Takeover reference: \\"The Investment Canada Act ‚Äì Canada‚Äôs waking giant?\\", by E Dufour and I Ahmad, 9 Nov 2010 As of November 2010, the federal government had reviewed 1,637 takeovers since 1985 and rejected only one, that of MDA. On 3 November 2010, then-Minister of Industry Tony Clement imposed conditions for approval of the hostile takeover for over $38bn of Potash Corporation by Australia-based mining conglomerate BHP Billiton.cbc.ca: \\"BHP's PotashCorp bid rejected for now\\", 3 Nov 2010 On 15 November 2010, BHP-Billiton withdrew its bid, saying the conditions had proved too onerous.ctv.ca: \\"BHP Billiton withdraws bid for Canada's Potash Corp.\\", 15 Nov 2010  Criticism  While the Act was not used to formally block takeover bids and investments, its presence and vague mandate enables diplomats, public representatives and civil servants to informally dissuade investors, and creates a sense of government risk amongst foreign investment analysts. The scale of impact is difficult to measure and has not been widely studied. Nationalist critics believe the Act is too narrow and, as a matter of policy, should more heavily restrict foreign investment. Critics note that Canada's share of world direct investment fell significantly after 1985. Some of this is due to large increases in emerging economies' receipt of FDI, but Canada's share has fallen even amongst developed countries,(page 8) and in the late 2000s Canada became a net investor in the world.(page 13) Some critics note that the Harper government's use of the ICA has seemed unpredictable, resulting in a \\"chilling\\" effect on foreign investment in Canadian companies. This hidden effect, if it exists, could suppress the value of Canadian shares and companies by deterring potential investors from even considering Canada as a market or destination.Legal paper: http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=9a0bbc4e-175b-4b84-b515-9a78e883d4c5 In response to this criticism, on 15 November 2010 the Harper government signalled its intention to provide clear guidelines for its use of the ICA.thestar.com: \\"Canada‚Äôs investment controls among weakest in the world\\", op-ed by Tim Armstrong, 15 Nov 2010  References  Category:1985 in Canadian law Category:Investment in Canada Category:International business ","title":"Investment Canada Act"},{"id":"29606945","text":"Edward Reynolds was a bishop and author.

He has served as a Superintendent of Police (SP) in ten districts of Uttar Pradesh, and as an Inspector General (IG) in the state's Civil Defence department.  Early life  Amitabh Thakur was born at Muzaffarpur, Bihar. He was brought up in Bokaro and present-day Jharkhand (then a part of Bihar). He holds a B. Tech degree in mechanical engineering from IIT Kanpur.In pics: Bureaucrats who suffered at the hands of political class by being repeatedly transferred or denied plum posting, India Today He also has a FPM (PhD) Degree from IIM Lucknow.  Police career  Thakur began his police career in 1992. He has worked in ten districts of Uttar Pradesh, as a Superintendent of Police (SP). He has worked in multiple departments including Intelligence, Vigilance, Anti-Corruption and Police Training Academy. Thakur was directly promoted from the rank of SP to Inspector General (IG), because his promotion as DIG had been held due to inquiries against him. = 2005 suspension = In 2005, Amitabh was suspended while posted as the superintendent of police (SP) at Gonda. He was accused of issuing an arms licence to criminals. He defended himself arguing that he only cleared the files that had been already vetted by other officers and the district administration. = 2006 suspension = In 2006, some criminals kidnapped a jeweller from Padan town, which comes under the purview of Jasrana police station. Accusing the police of slackness, the locals organised a protest and demanded action against the officer in-charge. Thakur was the SP of Ferozabad at that time. In response to the protests, he transferred the Jasrana police station in-charge VK Trivedi, for dereliction of duty. Ramvir Singh Yadav, a Samajwadi Party leader and the MLA, asked Thakur to move Trivedi back to Jasrana. However, Thakur refused to oblige. Some days later, Thakur came to Yadav's native village Paidath, to review the security arrangements for a state minister's visit to the village. There, Yadav and his supporters allegedly threatened and manhandled him over Trivedi's transfer. Seven constables deputed in the security of Yadav also supported Yadav, and threatened Thakur's staff. Outnumbered, Thakur and his staff fled and stopped at the Eka police station to lodge an FIR. The officer in-charge there initially refused to lodge an FIR against the MLA, and relented after \\"much persuasion\\". Ramvir was cleared of any wrongdoing, after the witnesses against him backtracked. = 2008 case against the state government = In April 2008, Thakur was selected for the four-year Fellow Programme in Management (FPM) at IIM Lucknow. Between April 2008 and March 2009, he sent three letters to the state government's Principal Secretary (Home) and the police DGP to grant him a study leave for the course. After failing to receive a response, he approached the Lucknow Bench of Central Administrative Tribunal in April 2009. The Tribunal ordered the state government to make a decision on his leave request within two weeks. When the government still didn't respond to his application, he filed a contempt petition with the Tribunal and also moved the High Court against the government. In May 2009, the government issued a letter, rejecting Thakur's request for study leave, on the basis that he had not sought permission from his immediate supervisor before opting for the course. The letter stated that the government would be able to grant him a leave for a maximum of one year. Thakur then again approached the Tribunal. Subsequently, the government sanctioned him a two-year leave. = 2015 suspension = In December 2014, Nutan Thakur filed a complaint against the state's mining minister Gayatri Prasad Prajapati, before the Lok Ayukta (anti- corruption ombudsman). She alleged that the minister was involved in illegal mining activities. Thakur approached the Central Government, seeking protection for his family. In January 2015, a woman filed a rape case against Amitabh Thakur, while he was posted as IG (Civil Defence). The woman alleged that Nutan Thakur promised her assistance in getting a government job, and asked her to come to the Thakurs' residence in Gomti Nagar, where she was raped. The Thakurs dismissed the complaint as bogus, saying that it had been filed in response to Nutan's complaint against the minister, and that the complainant was related to a Samajwadi Party leader. In May 2015, an RTI activist Sanjay Sharma alleged that Thakur had amassed huge wealth, and sought a probe into the matter. He wrote to the state's Governor Ram Naik, alleging that Thakur and his wife had ten properties in their names in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. These properties included a High Income Group (HIG) house in Viramkhand in Gomti Nagar, a plot in Khargapur, a 5000 square feet plot in Ujriyon, a house in Mujaffarpur, a house in Patna, a house in Sitamarhi, and agricultural land in Bihar. Sharma claimed that according to the couple's official records, they earned about 288,000 lakh annually through these properties. He further alleged that after people raised questions about his properties, Thakur modified his statement of assets to conceal 8 of these properties. Governor Naik directed Thakur's superior, the Director General of Civil defense, to probe these allegations. Thakur admitted that he and his wife held these properties, some of them ancestral. But he denied any wrongdoing or attempts to conceal these properties. He stated that he was open to \\"any kind of vigilance or CBI inquiry\\" into his properties. On 11 July 2015, Thakur lodged an FIR against the state's former Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav. He alleged that Yadav had threatened him over a phone call. He released the audio of the phone call, in which Yadav is allegedly heard saying the following sentences: * \\"You were very insolent...Everyone took you inside the school and wanted to beat you. I was the one who saved you.\\" (referring to the incident in which Thakur was manhandled by Jasrana MLA Ramveer Singh Yadav) * \\"There could be more dire consequences, I am telling you. I went to Patna where your family members requested me to help and save you.\\" * \\"I am telling you, aap sudhar jaaiye (mend your ways). This is all I want to say.\\" Thakur alleged that Mulayam Singh was unhappy about the complaint lodged by his wife Nutan against the state minister Gayatri Prasad Prajapati. On 12 July, a rape case was registered against Thakur by the Lucknow police, based on the complaint filed in January. On 13 July, the state government suspended Thakur, accusing him of \\"indiscipline, holding anti-government views, dereliction of duty and violating service rules\\". The government also alleged that he had misused government resources and given incomplete information about his assets in his annual declaration of property.  Activism  = Anti-corruption = Amitabh Thakur is the founder of the National RTI Forum, a grassroots anti-corruption organisation in India that advocates for government openness under the terms of the 2005 Right to Information Act. The organisation is based in Lucknow. = Human rights = Thakur has formed Institute for Research and Documentation in Social Sciences (IRDS), a human rights organisation. He recorded the dying declaration of journalist Jagendra Singh; the video allegedly indicated the involvement of a state's minister in Singh's death. = Other issues = In January 2011, Thakur filed an FIR against Facebook and some of its users, for offensive comments against Mahatma Gandhi in a Facebook group called \\"I hate Gandhi\\".Case against Facebook for hosting 'I hate Gandhi' group Facebook banned the group a couple of days later. = PILs = Amitabh Thakur and his wife Nutan have filed over 500 RTI applications and 150 Public Interest Litigations (PILs). A number of PILs filed by the Thakurs resulted in action, but many were rejected by the courts as \\"frivolous\\". For example, in 2011, the Thakurs filed PIL seeking a ban on the songs Munni Badnaam Hui and Sheila Ki Jawani. The PIL claimed that the songs were against \\"public decency and morality\\", violated provisions of the Cinematography Act 1952, and had resulted in cases of eve teasing. The Thakurs' counsel Asok Pande was fined 200,000 twice for frivolous PILs. In 2014, the Allahabad High Court declared them to be \\"chronic petitioners\\". In April 2014, the High Court directed its registry not to accept any PIL from Amitabh Thakur. The court stated that, as a government servant, he needed to obtain a permission from the state government for filing PILs. His wife Nutan was also ordered to deposit 25,000 every time she filed a PIL; the deposit would be returned if the court found the PIL was about a genuine public cause, else the money would be forfeited. The court said that this was necessary to deter frivolous petitions which waste the court's time and money. Nutan Thakur moved to the Supreme Court, which upheld the High Court's order.  As a writer  Thakur has co-authored two books, and has compiled two collections of poems. He and his wife are working on a book on Arvind Kejriwal. His book Fresh Brew - Chronicles of Business and Freedom, co-authored with Amit Haralalka, traces the careers of 25 IIM Lucknow alumni who turned entrepreneurs.  Personal life  Amitabh Thakur is married to Nutan Thakur. The couple has two children - a daughter named Tanaya and a son named Aditya, both law students.

Early life and education The son of a shepherd, Enders studied economics, politics, and history at the University of Bonn and the University of California, Los Angeles. He completed his doctorate in political science at the age of 28 on a scholarship of Konrad Adenauer Foundation. Career Enders started out his career with early work experience as an assistant at the German Parliament. In 1988, he worked as a researcher at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP) in Bonn and at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in London. Enders also serves as a Major in the German Army Reserve, and spent two years in the planning staff of the Federal Ministry of Defence from 1989 until 1991. Enders joined the marketing department of DaimlerChrysler Aerospace in 1991 and held several functions at DASA until he was promoted to head the defence and security systems business in the frame of the merger of EADS in 2000.

As a result of the governance change, Enders was appointed CEO of Airbus, the Group's largest Division. As CEO of the commercial aircraft division, he was responsible for the A320neo launch in 2010, a sales success that forced Boeing to launch the 737 MAX. In May 2012, the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders approved Enders' nomination to become CEO of EADS. Shortly after his nomination, Enders embarked on a plan to merge with UK-based BAE Systems, which would have created the world's leading defence company. However, the merger plan ‚Äì the only remaining realistic opportunity to fulfill the company's Vision2020 strategy ‚Äì failed ultimately due to political intervention.

Although Germany, France and Spain are shareholders of the group, none hold any special blocking rights, meaning the company is governed solely by the Board of Directors and the Executive Management. After the failure of the merger with BAE Systems, Enders initiated a review of the company's strategy, which was completed in July 2013.

Similar to Ex Tempore, the literary magazine of the United Nations Society of Writers, UN Special functions on a voluntary basis, with staff from the UN and other Geneva-based international organizations and agencies contributing in their free time, beyond their formal duties; it also collaborates closely with the Swiss Press Club. A nonprofit, noncommercial magazine, it seeks to embody the UN's cooperation between people of all backgrounds.

UN Special changed its name to NewSpecial to make space for UN Today and allow both magazines to coexist.  History Cover of the first issue of the UN Special, 1949. The first issue of UN Special was published on 24 October 1949. It was handwritten and the cover was signed by the members of the Editorial Committee at that time. Among the articles, essays and UN announcements in this very first issue under the Chief Editor R.J Spencer, we find a welcoming address by Wladimir Moderow, the representative of the Secretary-General, the Director- General of the European Office of the United Nations (the nation of the United Nations Office at Geneva in 1949) and by Gunnar Myrdal, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, UNECE. Another interesting contribution was dedicated to the celebration of the United Nations Day, announcing public reading of the Preamble of the UN Charter. This first issue contained 22 black and white pages without defined columns and without photos. Over the years, the UN Special has developed to become a professional 50 page- magazine with an average of 32 articles, mainly in English and French (the six official UN languages are English, French, Russian, Spanish, Arabic and Chinese). Earlier, the content of the magazine tended to focus on UN staff issues, however, with its development and increase in outreach, the magazine covers a broad range of topics related to the work of international organizations and governance, such as peace-keeping, poverty reduction, human rights, climate change mitigation, environmental protection, natural disaster management and the status of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The recent global discussions on greening the economy and enhancing sustainable development are reflected in the magazine due to the engagement within these topics of those contributing to the UN Special. Cultural and environmental world heritage sites (listed by UNESCO), find their coverage in the magazine as well.

Based on an idea from UN Special magazine and from its editor- in-chief, the event (also called UN Green Day) was made possible through the efforts of an organizing committee drawn from the United Nations Geneva office, UNEP and WIPO, as well as contributions and assistance from the Swiss Confederation, the Canton and City of Geneva, the permanent missions of Brazil, Denmark, Italy, Japan and Rwanda and other partners. = Memorial to honour those who lost their lives for peace = Memorial in Ariana ParkSpecial attention and tribute was given to United Nations staff and international civil servants who lost their lives under the duties of the United Nations in different parts of the world. A special Memorial was inaugurated at the initiative of UN Special with the support of the United Nations Secretary General and under the auspices of the United Nations Office at Geneva Director-General to commemorate those who lost their lives for the high ideals of the United Nations Memorial to honour those who lost their lives for the high ideas of the United Nations (see UN Special No.600). The Memorial was inaugurated at the grounds of the Palais des Nations, in the Ariana Park, in 2003. This Memorial in Ariana Park symbolizes all UN peacekeepers and a celebration of the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers takes place at the grounds of this Memorial to remember those who served in the UN peacekeeping operations and to honor the memory of those who died in the name of peace. Each year, at the end of May, UN staff and the Soldier for Peace International Association come to this Memorial to pay tribute to the women and men who serve, or have served, in United Nations peace missions across the globe, to salute their courage and commitment, their dedication and determination to serve fellow human beings in dangerous and difficult circumstances. Special ceremony is conducted near this Memorial in Ariana Park to honour more than 2,500 civilian and military personnel who have died in the line of duty since 1948. Near this Memorial UN colleagues vow to remember them, and pledge to carry on their efforts, to honour their memory and to ensure that their sacrifice will serve the cause of peace and stability in the world. = \\"Rice is life\\" = \\"Rice is life\\" was selected as the slogan for the International Year of Rice 2004. The slogan illustrated the significance of rice across the globe, and its importance to nutrition, livelihood, culture, and the natural environment. On the occasion of the International Year of Rice decided by the United Nations General Assembly, the UN Special magazine together with the United Nations family, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) prepared an international cookbook, Rice Around the World. From Santiago to Bangkok, from Beijing to The Cape, from Tashkent to Cairo, rice nourishes more than 3 billion people throughout the world. In each of these cities, in each of these countries, from the richest to the poorest, each one has its own way of accommodating rice, or rices as there are so many types. The book was prepared by the international civil servants as well as goodwill people from all over the world. The so-called \\"Rice Team\\" from the UN Special Editorial Board collected, compiled and put such a book together offering to its readers to go around the world with 300 recipes from over 100 countries. The benefits were donated to the UNICEF to help fighting against hunger.

It was established in 2010 as a merger between the two media outlets. The company was owned by IAC/InterActiveCorp and the estate of Sidney Harman, with Stephen Colvin of The Daily Beast as CEO. In August 2013, IBT Media acquired Newsweek, leaving The Daily Beast under the management of The Newsweek Daily Beast Company, which today operates as a subsidiary of IAC. History Newsweek magazine was launched in 1933 by a group of U.S. stockholders \\"which included Ward Cheney, of the Cheney silk family, John Hay Whitney, and Paul Mellon, son of Andrew W. Mellon,\\" according to America's 60 Families by Ferdinand Lundberg. The Daily Beast was founded in 2008 by Tina Brown, former editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker as well as the short-lived Talk Magazine. Newsweek was purchased by The Washington Post Company in 1961. With increasing competition from online news sources, years of financial losses forced the Company to sell the magazine in 2010 to Harman Media, owned by Sidney Harman. =Merger= In November 2010, it was announced that Newsweek and The Daily Beast would merge into a joint venture named The Newsweek Daily Beast Company, with IAC and Sidney Harman each owning 50 percent of the new company. Harman's rationale for the merger was that: \\"In an admittedly challenging time, this merger provides the ideal combination of established journalism authority and bright, bristling website savvy.\\" The company plans to redirect the Newsweek.com address to The Daily Beast, despite the fact that the former has higher traffic. Tina Brown, who co-founded The Daily Beast, acts as editor-in-chief for both Newsweek and The Daily Beast. Reception to the merger was not positive. As former Newsweek president Mark Edmiston comments on The New York Times, \\"I don‚Äôt see how you can take two money-losing businesses and put them together and come up with a single entity that makes money.\\" As the two businesses target very different demographics, Edmiston questioned the appeal of the merger to advertisers. Newsweek staffers reacted ambivalently to the merger. There was opposition to redirecting the Newsweek.com site, due to the amount of effort and work that staffers have spent on building the site. The news came unexpectedly to staffers, a sentiment reflected on SaveNewsweek.com, which states that \\"It‚Äôs always nice to wake up and find out in the Times that your job is doomed\\". In 2012, it was announced that Newsweek would stop publishing its print magazine by December. The Newsweek brand would be retooled as Newsweek Global and continue as a digital-only magazine for e-book readers and tablet computers. On August 3, 2013, IBT Media announced it had acquired Newsweek from IAC on terms that were not disclosed; the acquisition included the Newsweek brand and its online publication, but did not include The Daily Beast. Company holdings The company owned Newsweek, a news magazine, and The Daily Beast, a news website.

It is home to the Central Cemetery of Montevideo. History The history of Barrio Sur started around 1835 with the foundation of the cemetery. With the end of slavery in Uruguay, it became predominantly inhabited by Afro-Uruguayans. The first generation of liberated slaves started reviving some of the rituals of their countries of origin, which became known as Tangos or Tambos. From these rituals was born the Candombe. On 6 January, they held the ritual parade called \\"Llamad de los reyes\\" which honoured to the eldest members of the community. Later generations of Afro-Uruguayans gave up these rituals and focused rather on becoming integrated with the rest of the society of Montevideo. In more recent times, these rituals have been revived and have become an important part of the culture of Montevideo. Culture Skyline of Ciudad Vieja and Barrio Sur View at sunset in Barrio Sur To this day, Barrio Sur remains very connected with the music of the Afro-Uruguayan culture.

Pterygotioids were the most derived members of the infraorder Diploperculata and the sister group of the adelophthalmoid eurypterids. The group includes the basal and small hughmilleriids, the larger and specialized slimonids and the famous pterygotids which were equipped with robust and powerful cheliceral claws. Though the more primitive hughmilleriids were small, Hughmilleria wangi being the smallest of all pterygotioids at just in length, later members of the group, particularly in the Pterygotidae, would become the largest known arthropods to ever exist with several genera surpassing in length. Among all currently recognized eurypterid clades, the Pterygotioidea is the most diverse, containing over 50 species in 10 genera. With the number of recognized eurypterid species being around 250, pterygotioids account for more than a fifth of all known eurypterid species. Though the group only existed for around 70 million years and during a time when most continents were separated by large expanses of water (in contrast with previous and later periods of time when there had been supercontinents), the Pterygotioidea had the most cosmopolitan distribution of all eurypterid groups. Their fossils have been recovered from Europe, Africa, North America, South America, Asia and Australia, with the earliest remains being from the Early Silurian of Scotland and South China. The exact geographical origin of the group remains unknown, but is thought to have been in Laurentia. Though several characteristic and diagnostic traits can be established for each of the families included within the Pterygotioidea, the group as a whole is primarily joined together by the shared features of marginal eyes, that their compound eyes are placed near or on the margin of the carapace (the \\"head\\" plate). Description Pterygotioid eurypterids, whose fossils are recovered in deposits ranging in age from the Early Silurian to the Late Devonian, can be distinguished from all other eurypterine eurypterids by the placement of their eyes, being located near or in some cases on the margin of the carapace (the \\"head\\" plate). Pterygotioids ranged in size from small eurypterids, the smallest being Hughmilleria wangi at just in length, to the largest arthropods to ever live, the largest being Jaekelopterus rhenaniae which might have reached lengths of .Lamsdell, James C.; Braddy, Simon J.

ISSN 1744-9561. PMID 19828493. Supplementary information Like all other chelicerates, and other arthropods in general, pterygotioid eurypterids possessed segmented bodies and jointed appendages (limbs) covered in a cuticle composed of proteins and chitin. In the Pterygotidae, the outer surface of the exoskeleton was covered in a scale-like ornamentation but it was smooth within Slimonidae and Hughmilleriidae. The chelicerate body is divided into two tagmata (sections); the frontal prosoma (head) and posterior opisthosoma (abdomen). The appendages were attached to the prosoma, and were characterized in pterygotids and slimonids by being small and slender and lacking spines. In contrast, the more basal Hughmilleriids did possess spines on their appendages. In derived members of the group, Slimonidae and Pterygotidae, the telson (the posteriormost segment of the body) was expanded and flattened, often with a spike protruding from its end. The telsons of the Hughmilleriidae were not flattened, instead being lanceolate (in the shape of a lance or spike) and similar to those of more primitive eurypterids such as Eurypterus.Clarke, J. K., Ruedemann R. (1912) \\"The Eurypterida of New York\\" Like other chelicerates, pterygotioids possessed chelicerae. These appendages are the only ones that appear before the mouth and take the form of small pincers used to feed in most eurypterid groups. This function is retained in the more basal Hughmilleriidae and Slimonidae, but pterygotid chelicerae were large and long with strong and well developed teeth on specialized chelae (claws).  History of research  Fossils described by John William Salter as belonging to \\"Pterygotus problematicus\\" in 1852. This species is now considered a nomen vanum.The first pterygotioid fossils to be uncovered were those of the type genus, Pterygotus. Louis Agassiz, a Swiss-American biologist and geologist, described the fossils in 1839 and named it Pterygotus in the mistaken belief that they were the fossil remains of a large fish; \\"Pterygotus\\" translating to \\"winged fish\\". Agassiz first recognized the true nature of the fossils as arthropod remains five years later in 1844 after having examined more complete fossils recovered in the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland. In 1856, the species Pterygotus acuminata was named by John William Salter. The fossils referred to this species, recovered from Lesmahagow, Scotland, were soon realized to be distinct from other species of Pterygotus (such as the type species P. anglicus) and that same year geologist David Page erected a new genus to contain the species. The new genus, Slimonia, could be differentiated from other known species of Pterygotus most apparently by the lack of large cheliceral claws, otherwise a defining characteristic of Pterygotus. In 1903, the genus Hughmilleria was created based on fossils discovered in the Pittsford Shale Member of the Vernon Formation. Its describer, the American geologist Clifton J. Sarle, considered the genus to represent an intermediate form between the more basal Eurypterus and the derived Pterygotus but did not assign Hughmilleria to any particular family. The family Pterygotidae was erected in 1912 by John Mason Clarke and Rudolf Ruedemann to constitute a group for the genera Pterygotus, Slimonia, Hastimima and Hughmilleria. Pterygotus had also been designated as containing two subgenera; Pterygotus (Curviramus) and Pterygotus (Erettopterus), but Erettopterus would later be raised to its own genus. American paleontologist Erik N. Kjellesvig-Waering emended the Pterygotidae in 1951, referring the genera Hastimima, Hughmilleria and Slimonia, and the newly named Grossopterus, to their own family within the Eurypteracea, Hughmilleriidae, leaving Pterygotus as the sole pterygotid genus. In 1955, Norwegian paleontolgist and geologist Leif St√∏rmer considered the pterygotid clade to represent a family within the eurypterid superfamily \\"Eurypteracea\\". In 1962, Russian paleontologist Nestor Ivanovich Novojilov raised the Eurypteracea and Pterygotidae to subordinal and superfamily status, Eurypteracea becoming the suborder Eurypterina and creating the superfamily Pterygotioidea, containing Hughmilleriidae and Pterygotidae.Novojilov, N. 1962: Order Eurypterida. In Orlov, J. A. (ed.): Osnovy Paleontologii - volume 7, 404-423. Akademii Nauk SSSR, Moscow. The same year, Novojilov also reclassified Slimonia into a pterygotioid family of its own as it was considered distinct enough from other hughmilleriids to warrant a separate family, the Slimonidae.  Classification  Hughmilleria socialis. Hughmilleria is the most basal known genus in the Pterygotioidea. = External phylogeny = Pterygotioids are classified within the infraorder Diploperculata, in the Eurypterina suborder of eurypterids. The infraorder Diploperculata contains the four most derived superfamilies of eurypterine eurypterids; Carcinosomatoidea, Adelophthalmoidea, Pterygotioidea and the waeringopteroids, united by the shared feature that the genital operculum (the structure that contains the genital appendage) is made up of two fused segments. Pterygotioidea is the most derived superfamily of the suborder and contains over 50 species (the exact number obscured by dubious species and possible synonyms), which accounts for more than a fifth of the approximately 250 known eurypterid species. The closest sister group of the Pterygotioidea, Adelophthalmoidea, also contains a large amount of species, over 40, and is the second most diverse eurypterid superfamily. The cladogram below is simplified from 2007 study by O. Erik Tetlie, showcasing the position of the pterygotioids within the suborder Eurypterina. Placement of Diploperculata follows Lamsdell et al. 2013. = Internal phylogeny = Largest sizes of the type genera of each of the pterygotioid families, Pterygotus, Slimonia and Hughmilleria, compared to a human. Though the Pterygotidae are accepted to clearly represent the most derived group within the pterygotioid superfamily, there has been an ongoing debate on whether the hughmilleriids or the slimonids are the most closely related to the pterygotids, and thus also which of the two families is the most basal. This debate was resolved with the description of Ciurcopterus, a primitive pterygotid that clearly combines features of Slimonia (especially within the appendages) and of more derived pterygotid eurypterids, revealing that Slimonidae was the closest sister-group of the Pterygotidae. The lack of ornamentation in the telson of Hughmilleria, combined with the fact that the genus shares certain characteristics with basal adelophthalmids (in particular the triangular anterior margin of the carapace), places it as the most basal genus in the superfamily. Hughmilleria also possessed far more gnathobasic (of the gnathobase, an appendage used in feeding) teeth than any other pterygotioid, possessing 18-20 whilst more derived pterygotioids (including related hughmilleriid Herefordopterus) possessed only 12-13. The cladogram presented below, derived from a 2007 study by researcher O. Erik Tetlie, showcases the interrelationships between the pterygotioid eurypterids. Whilst Slimonidae and Pterygotidae form monophyletic (and thus valid) groups, Hughmilleriidae has been recovered as paraphyletic in a number of phylogenetic analyses and does thus not form an actually valid scientific grouping. Nevertheless, the family is retained and routinely used by eurypterid researchers.  Distribution  Eurypterids are most commonly recovered from fossil deposits in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, Britain and North America. During the Silurian and Devonian periods, when pterygotioids were alive, these regions and continents were part of the continents Baltica (Scandinavia and Eastern Europe), Avalonia (Germany, Britain, parts of eastern North America) and Laurentia (most of eastern continental North America). It is around these continents, and the Rheno-Hercynian Terrane (western and central Europe), that pterygotioids are the most common. Pterygotioid fossils have also been recovered from other parts of the world where fossils of other eurypterid groups are absent, including Australia, Morocco, Libya, Florida, Saudi Arabia, China, Paris, South America, Bohemia and Siberia, which indicates that the group had spread significantly during their 70 million year existence. Pterygotioids appear to have been relatively abundant throughout the Silurian and Devonian world, with unusually (in terms of eurypterids, most groups being absent entirely) large numbers recovered from the ancient continent of Gondwana (composed of Africa, India, South America, Australia and Antarctica). The earliest known pterygotioids, belonging to the genus Hughmilleria, are from the Llandovery epoch of the Silurian and appear around the same time in Laurentia, Scotland and South China. With the group already being widespread at this seemingly early stage in their evolution, it is difficult to pinpoint their exact geographical point of origin. The closest relatives and sister clade of the pterygotioids, the superfamily Adelophthalmoidea, originated in Laurentia. Modern researchers assume that the case would be the same with the pterygotioids, which are thought to have originated within, or in close proximity to, Laurentia. It remains unclear whether pterygotioids were capable of crossing oceans on a regular basis or if species recovered outside of Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia represent isolated occurrences. Pterygotioids were, like the related adelophthalmoids, excellent swimmers which might help explain the intercontinental dispersal patterns and wide-ranging distribution seen in both superfamilies.

Sutton has a pub, a mobile post office and a place of worship. There is also the hamlet of Sutton Street and the Sutton Common estate nearby. History Sutton in Old English means \\"Southern Farm\\"; sut meaning \\"south\\" and ton meaning \\"farmstead\\" or \\"settlement.\\" John Marius Wilson described Sutton in the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1868) as : \\"a parish, with a village, in Woodbridge district, Suffolk; on the river Deben, 3 miles SE of Woodbridge r. station. It has a post-office under Wood-bridge. Acres, 6,410; of which 430 are water. The Domesday Book is the oldest public record of the village; the book features information on Sutton as early as 1086. In that year there were 77 families living in Sutton and the Lord of Sutton was Robert Malet. =Employment= According to the 1831 Enumeration, there were 680 people living in Sutton. One hundred of the 126 families in Sutton at the time were said to be \\"... chiefly employed in Agriculture. All parishes within the hundred of Wilford, including Sutton, according to this information had families working primarily in agriculture. Arthur Young toured Suffolk in 1784 and wrote three accounts of farmers he was introduced to in Sutton of which: \\"Mr. William Waller, of Sutton, one of the greatest farmers in the neighbourhood, has 2700 acres, ploughs 1000, and has above 1000 sheep. Other statistics taken from the 1831 Census were Social status. These statistics state that over three-quarters of the people living in Sutton were labourers and servants. Meanwhile, only a very small fraction of the population made up the middling sorts, that is owners of small farms. These statistics are based upon the contemporary ideas of social status not as people would judge them today. =Churches= All Saints Church All Saints Church was built in 1555 and was largely reconstructed by the Victorians. This medieval church has a font that dates back before the Reformation, which is strange, as the Church now belongs to the Church of England. The font is the only remnants of a pre-Reformation church, as it burnt down in the 17th century. Notable people buried in the churchyard include: * Edith Pretty (1883‚Äì1942), the landowner on whose land the Sutton Hoo burials were discovered. * Brian Forster Morton Franks DSO MC TD (1910‚Äì1982), a former lieutenant colonel in the Special Air Service and an agent of Secret Intelligence Service. He was educated at Eton College and fought in World War II. He was awarded the MC in 1943, before gaining the rank of lieutenant colonel in the service of the Middlesex Yeomanry and receiving the DSO in 1944. He was further decorated with the Legion of Honour and the Croix de Guerre. He gained the rank of honorary colonel in the service of the 21st SAS Regiment. Baptist Chapel There is also a small Baptist church, called the Chapel, located on Main Road, which was founded in 1813. =War memorial= In 1954 a Memorial Hall was built to commemorate all the soldiers from Sutton who fought in the Second World War. The hall was built by local people; both men and women participated in plastering the walls, donating electric heaters and buying curtains. The opening ceremony was held on 30 October 1958. The total population in Sutton (Suffolk) from 1801 to 2011. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward includes Bromeswell and had a total population of 3,014 at the 2011 Census. Present day Sutton is situated between the River Deben and Rendlesham Forest with the famous Sutton Hoo estate to the North of Sutton which is the site of an Anglo-Saxon ship burial. According to the 2011 census the parish has a population of 1,804. The most common occupations in Sutton, according to the 2011 census, are Associate Professionals and Technical occupations especially in the Protective services. Within Sutton there is a town hall known as Memorial Hall, a pub called the Plough Inn, the All Saints Church and a smaller Baptist church known as the Chapel. Nearby there are tourist attractions such as the Sutton Hoo burial site, Rendlesham Forest and the River Deben. =Memorial Hall= The Memorial hall is used to host community clubs. Clubs include a ladies' group that meet every second Thursday of each month and a computer group. The hall is also used for Pilates and dance classes. The recreation ground behind the hall is used by Sutton Heath Football club for their Under-14 and Under-12 teams as their original ground at Hollesley is too small to accommodate all the teams since the club has expanded. There is also a local bowls club that play on the green on the recreation ground. The bowls club have received a lottery grant to refurbish their hut for their closing tournament in September 2014. =Rendlesham Forest= The forest is owned by the Forestry Commission who have created many different walking and cycling trails, events and play areas throughout the forest. The forest is 1500 hectares large and in 1980 was the site of a UFO sighting (Rendlesham Forest incident). In 2012 a new parish boundary was created. Residents sent a petition to the Suffolk Coast District council for a new parish in the north-east of Sutton. The new parish is called Sutton Heath and was created because it is more urban than its surrounding area in Sutton and therefore has different needs. Sutton Hoo Sutton Hoo Burial Mound The Sutton Hoo Estate is 225 acres and contains the burial site of an Anglo-Saxon ship. Archaeologist Basil Brown from the Ipswich Museum discovered the Anglo- Saxon Burial at Sutton Hoo in 1940. The site is believed to be the final resting place of the king of East Anglia, Redwald. Most of the artefacts excavated now reside in the British Museum. The burial site is now owned by the National Trust and is a major tourist attraction with facilities such as a caf√©, parking and a gift shop. Sutton Hall Sutton Hall is a Georgian country house with surrounding estates to the south of the village, formerly the home of Sir Guy Quilter. It was sold in 2018 for over ¬£31.5 million. Bentwaters RAF Bentwaters is an inactive military base located in Rendlesham Forest. The site is privately owned by a family business called Bentwaters Parks. Bentwaters Parks hires the site out to television and film making companies who wish to make use of the military style buildings located at RAF Bentwaters. The military base was the last to be built before the end of the Second World War. The area was chosen because of its flat terrain and because it was sparsely populated; suitable for building the runways the base required. The base had a large impact on the population of Sutton from its opening in 1941 men came to work on the base and the population of Sutton increased drastically as shown in population graph.

It is within the City of Winchester local government ward of Wonston And Micheldever. Winchester is also the nearest large settlement, lying approximately south of the hamlet. History Within the past thirty years, the landed estate which owned much of Weston Colley has sold (mostly to private owners) its housing portfolio, retaining most of the farmland within and around the hamlet, together with Weston Farm, which is run on a long tenancy. The landed estate is now owned by Zurich Financial Services, which acquired it as part of its buy-out of Eagle Star Insurance - which, in-turn, bought the assets from the estate of J. Arthur Rank - based at near-by Sutton Scotney. The housing stock mainly dates from the 1930s but there are some centuries' old thatched, oak- timber buildings.  Business & Services Whilst there are no large commercial activities in Weston Colley, some residents operate enterprising small businesses. Examples are a lock-up yard, farm, horticultural service, photo-artist, a bed-and-breakfast and a small (maximum five caravans) certified field camping site. However, the hamlet has no shops, pubs nor places of worship. ADSL broadband-internet is limited to about six GB because Micheldever's telephone exchange serves a small population (therefore is low priority to British Telecom) and because of the distance from that exchange. The quality of service is, however, good, with few drop-outs. Both the telephone / broadband wires and those that deliver electricity are located above ground on poles. There is mains water. However, there is no cable TV / fibre broadband, no mains gas nor mains sewage (residents have septic tanks in their gardens). Nearby services include: churches in several villages, a village shop, petrol station and doctors' surgery in Sutton Scotney, a primary school in Micheldever and Micheldever railway station on the South Western Main Line. More comprehensive services are available in Winchester (circa nine miles), Andover and Basingstoke (both circa fifteen miles) At each end of the hamlet is a bridge. The Micheldever end has an elevated railway line over the single-track lane, restricting the height of traffic below. At the Stoke Charity end, the River Dever is crossed by a single-track road bridge, which was rebuilt in the 2000s to safely carry heavy grain lorries to and from the farm. By the railway bridge is a mobile telephone transceiver, owned by EE. Some while ago, Vodafone applied to install another mast, close by. However, whereas the EE mast is camouflaged by trees, the proposed Vodafone mast was much taller and received considerable local opposition. Geography The River Dever at Weston Colley Weston Colley is located entirely within the Dever Valley; the River Dever flows through the hamlet but briefly disappears under the tall Victorian railway-track embankment which separates Weston Colley from Micheldever. The busy main London (Waterloo) to Southampton railway still uses the line. There is one proper through-road (Weston Lane) in the hamlet, from Northbrook (Micheldever) at one end and toward Stoke Charity at the other. There is also a green lane (unsuitable for most road transport) from Micheldever Station. Weston Colley sits on southern English chalk downland. This means the valley sides rise gently and the River Dever runs very clear - though it dries in arid summers (chalk being porous). Bare soil is alkaline and populated by chunks of flint. Most of the non-garden area is arable fields with some woodland by the river. A few cows, nursing young cattle, are often to be seen in the water meadow but the dairy has not operated for decades.

The Yorkshire and national newspapers were gripped by the story of a young girl called Hannah Beedham who became known as the 'Kelfield Prophetess'. Whilst staying at James Sturdy's home in Kelfield, Hannah described having a vision where she was told the date of her death. Thousands of people flocked to Kelfield to be 'in at the death'. The newspapers reported Hannah Beedham's exploits with growing cynicism and glee when she failed to die as promised on 1 August 1833 at 9.00 pm. She had laid herself out in state in James Sturdy's Kelfield parlour, and thousands of curious people from all over Yorkshire filed past, in the hope of seeing a miracle. When she did not pass away, Sturdy must have wondered how to extricate himself from the embarrassing situation. Hannah died a few years later aged only 27 years.

He was a contributor to Claridad, the periodical of Francisco Largo Caballero, as well as a member of the Defense Council of Madrid, in which capacity he signed the orders for the removal from the prisons of Madrid various inmates who were subsequently massacred. At the end of the Spanish Civil War he went into exile in Latin America, where he taught literature.  Life  Born in Madrid, Serrano obtained a Bachelor of Arts at the Facultad de Filosof√≠a y Letras in the University of Madrid, and later earned a law degree. As a student he joined the Socialist Youth of Spain (FJS). Like most of the members, he belonged to the Caballerist wing that was opposed to the tendencies led by Juli√°n Besteiro and Indalecio Prieto. He was one of the editors of Renovaci√≥n, an organ of the FJS, and joined the executive of the FJS in 1934. He took part in the negotiations over the unification with the Communist Youth, and after the creation of the Unified Socialist Youth (JSU), he formed part of its executive. Along with most of the other JSU directors who had originated from the FJS, he joined the Communist Party on 6 November 1936. He was immediately named deputy of public order for the Defense Council of Madrid at the orders of Santiago Carrillo, secretary general of the JSU and a fellow veteran of the FJS. He remained in the office until 27 November, when, depending on the source, he either resigned or was dismissed by Santiago Carrillo. During his time in that post, he had signed the orders that resulted in the removal, throughout the months of November and December, of various nationalist inmates from the Madrid prisons. Most of these prisoners would eventually be massacred. Serrano Poncela remained part of the executive of the JSU until the end of the Civil War, after which he went into exile and abandoned politics entirely. The rest of his life would be spent teaching literature at various Latin American universities. At the time of his exile, Serrano Poncela already had some experience as a writer. In 1935 he had written a political essay about the failed Revolution of 1934, The Socialist Party and the conquest of power, with a prologue by Luis Araquist√°in. While teaching at the University of Santo Domingo, he embarked on a literary career in earnest, becoming sole editor of the literary review Panorama. He also collaborated with other Spanish Republican publications, such as Realidad / Revista de ideas, published in Argentina from 1947 to 1948, and Cuadernos del Congreso por la Libertad de la Cultura, published in Paris beginning in May 1953. After a period teaching in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, he was hired by the Central University of Venezuela, where he served as professor of cultural history, literary theory, and Spanish literature. He remained there until the founding in 1970 of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var University, whose rector, Eloy Lares Mart√≠nez, tapped him to organize and head the new university's department of social sciences and humanities. Serrano Poncela's oeuvre comprises essays as well as works of fiction, both short stories and novels, derived from his experiences during the Spanish Civil War and in exile afterward.

Location Capurro shares borders with La Teja to the north west, Prado to the north east, Bella Vista to the south east and it borders the Bay of Montevideo to the south west.  History  The early history of the area was marked by the trade of slaves from Africa. Slave trading ships had first arrived in Montevideo in 1743. The Spanish company Real Compa√±√≠a de Filipinas, after its first such import in 1787, was forced by the government to build quaranteen barracks for the slaves, for the protection from epidemic diseases. These barracks, that came to be known as \\"Caser√≠o de los Negros\\", were built in the coast of Capurro. After the declaration of Independence, they were demolished. The name and foundation of Capurro are related to the Genoan mariner Giovanni Battista Capurro.Page dedicated to G.B.Capurro and his family He arrived in the country at the time of the first Constitution and acquired coastal land in this area around 1830. His home, which was surrounded by wonderful gardens, took on the name \\"Mecca\\". The area he acquired was rich in springs and wells of fresh water and had a lot of sand. Capurro started selling fresh water to ships returning to Europe, as well as sand for ballast, causing the sand of the beach to dwindle away. In 1869, the \\"Compa√±√≠a de Tranv√≠as al Paso del Molino y Cerro\\" established a line of horsecars which connected Montevideo with the Villa del Cerro. This line brought many visitors to the area around the beach, which was called Playa Honda, transforming it into a relaxation and recreation area. The sons of Capurro started planning to build a big hotel, but the economic crisis of the 1890s stopped their plans. Instead, in 1910, a park was founded in its place, called Parque Capurro. It was designed by the Italian architect Giovanni Veltroni.

The south part of Bella Vista has also been known as Arroyo Seco (dry stream) from as early as 1756. The name is still used today, though there are no precise limits that describe this area. History Though there had been a few villas in this area before the 1840s, among which the residence of Joaqu√≠n Su√°rez, it was Francisco Far√≠as who started auctioning building lots of the area in 1842. At the time, Bella Vista was famous for offering a most scenic view of the bay and the city, hence its name. In 1869 the first train station was inaugurated in the area, but in 1873 the Estaci√≥n Central General Artigas in Aguada took its place. Main streets and squares The main streets of Bella Vista are Agraciada Avenue, Joaqu√≠n Su√°rez Avenue and Rambla Balthasar Brum, which runs along the coastline. Its two main squares are Plaza San Mart√≠n, dedicated to the Argentine independence hero, and Plaza Joaqu√≠n Su√°rez, dedicated to the politician and twice President of the Republic, whose statue, on the south edge of the square, marks the beginning of the homonymous avenue.

Flanary's 1993 Bay View Series consists of three granite rocks and one chunk of taconite iron ore. All have text on them, and the iron ore piece has a hole in the middle. The largest piece measures approximately 68 x 77 x 28 in. Description Peter Flanary's artwork outside the Bay View library is made up of four rocks placed around the building. The biggest and most prominent rock is a six-ton irregularly shaped piece of taconite iron ore, which is set into a concrete foundation. The iron ore has a 20 inch hole carved in the center., SIRIS. The other three boulders are granite, and are each placed next to a tree. All of the rocks have words carved into them. The boulder next to the Aspen tree, reads Aspen. The boulder next to the Willow tree, reads Willow. The boulder next to the Catalpa plant, reads Catulpa (sic). Historical information The Bay View Series, which cost about $20,000, was created as part of the Milwaukee Arts Board Percent for Art program. The program began in 2000 and requires that 1% of the total budgeted construction for projects exceeding $5000 be applied to public art.Milwaukee County Percent for Art guidelines The Bay View library fell into this category. Flanary's commission included a work inside the library that consists of three mosaic maps on the linoleum lobby floor. One of the maps represents Bay View at the time of its settlement in 1846. Another map represents Bay View in 1900, the year that a steel mill on the lakefront stimulated the community's growth. The third map shows Bay View as it is today.The Wisconsin Physicist, Vol. 11 No. 1, Fall/Winter 2004-05. p. 6. The environmental sculpture combines native trees with inscribed boulders outside the library building. One of the boulders comes from the Mesabi Range. Its high iron content relates to the steel mill once located in Bay View. The Bay View Series was dedicated on October 23, 1993 and is currently administered by the City of Milwaukee Library Board. Artist Peter Flanary grew up in the Milwaukee area, and currently has a studio in Mineral Point, Wisconsin., Flanary website. He was a part-time lecturer in the art department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, UW Madison. His work frequently incorporates rocks and other environmental objects. His creation process is rarely direct. \\"He tries to grasp the space in its complexity and wants to create something that can be remarked on by people.\\" \\"He likes material and form and works to have his piece support and work in its environment, growing out of, rather than intruding into the landscape.\\" Flanary's work is all over Wisconsin, including three pieces at the Urban Ecology Center in Milwaukee.

The Zone of \\"Mangang√°\\" The origin of the name \\"Manga\\" is believed to come from the short name of the word \\"Mangang√°\\", name which appeared mentioned in 1780, the zone later called \\"Manga\\". According to Benito Tesore, expert in Manga's history and its men that subsisted in the zone in the first years of the century. Lot of trenches and strongholds were built, possibly to stop the Portuguese advance (in Artigas' times). Armed with this assumption, it could be why municipal authority gave names as \\"Trinchera\\" (Trenches) and \\"Fort√≠n\\" (Fort) to two roads of the zone. The first owner of a ranch in Manga was Esteban Artigas (Son of the captain Juan Antonio Artigas), ceded by The Government of Spain. In the Register Aldecoa, from 1772-1773, he's figured as living with his six under-age children in The Manga, then known as \\"Pago del Arroyo de Sierra\\" (Zone of the brook of Mountain Range), known by that name because of a neighbour's surname of the zone. The farm \\"Mangafue\\"-it was called that way- was passing along years by different owners, one of them, Marcos Drapple, who, in February 1834, was offerin for sale to a Salting House called \\"Los Dos Hermanos\\" (The Two Brothers), located 3 ¬Ω miles from Montevideo. The edification consisted of two buildings, one of sixteen rooms, a store, a slaughter, a \\"barn raised\\" for storing hides, tallow, wool and grains, and a large warehouse with eaves to desalinate; the other one with a wooden trellis to stack the meat, with four doors of ventilation and a stable. According to \\"El Universal\\", it had good grazing lands and water, willow trees and quinces, and fencing to protect ten pitas acres of crops. In the grounds of Manga, put up for sale in January 1834, there were also two flourmills, a bricked oven with a pond and a footrest. The purchaser was Lus Fern√°ndez, and with his brother Jos√©, had been linked to the place for their activities, where they had been the late eighteenth century, a farm, grocery store and flourmill. Ownership of the farm was kept by Luis Fernandez after the death of Jos√© in 1819, inherited by Manuel Cifuentes, prestigious person in Cord√≥n, where he was justice of the peace. In 1832, Cifuentes was designated by the Economic Administrative Board of the Department of Montevideo to integrate the Public Education Committee of Extramural, together with Mat√≠as Tort and Pedro Pablo de la Sierra. In the period 1839-1841 he was a member of that such Board and years later, in 1863, after having resided in the Manga with his family during so-called Guerra Grande (Great War), he was invited to join the communal body as a backup to F√©lix Buxareo.

Early life Kyaw Hlaing was born on 28 September 1914 in Bogalay (in the present-day Ayeyarwady Region), son of wealthy parents with an interest in art. He studied art at Aid National Middle School. At the age of 18, with Ba Kyi, Aye Maung and Thein Han, he became a student under the master Ba Nyan, who had learned European oil painting techniques in London. After the Second World War he entered a national painting competition, winning prizes in the still life, figure and landscape categories, and the overall gold prize. He found work as an art instructor in Bogalay, later moving to Yangon where he taught in high schools for many years. Work Kyaw Hlaing belonged to the second generation of Burmese painters who studied under Ba Nyan in the 1930s. After Myanmar gained independence in 1948, he continued to practice the European painting techniques he had learned during the colonial period. Kyaw Hlaing exhibited at many art shows in the 1960s, and his paintings were collected by many art lovers. The majority of his work was in watercolor, this oeuvre of pieces counting in the many hundreds. His oil work was less prolific, and the number of paintings is not known precisely: nearly a score of these works have emerged in the hands of Yangon art dealers in recent years. Kyaw Hlaing quoted 80 oil paintings as an estimate of the number of oil works he had done in his lifetime. Kyaw Hlaing's watercolor works, which earned him the nickname \\"Cloudy\\", were rendered with skies full of clouds executed in many tones of white, often with portions of the clouds left unpainted to create a searing white given by the background watercolor paper. Many of his paintings are exhibited today in the New Treasure Art Gallery. Later years After retiring, he was appointed an instructor at the Yangon Fine Arts school, teaching third-year students. His pupils included Min Wae Aung, Zaw Zaw Aung, Hla Tun, Zaw Win Pe and Kyaw Shein. Kyaw Hlaing was a handsome man with a wiry, towering frame. Two of his students, Min Wae Aung and Zaw Zaw Aung, painted portraits of him. One of these works by Zaw Zaw Aung, an ironic oil painting titled Portrait of U Kyaw Hlaing: Visit Myanmar Year 1996 (1995), was done when Kyaw Hlaing had passed the age of 80. It captured only the lower part of his body in a longyi with his withered legs crossed and his upper body hidden by a newspaper he was reading. It is in the collection of the Singapore Art Museum. He was a calm and taciturn person with a taste for tea and cigars, always helpful to his fellow artists. He lived with his wife in a poor quarter of Yangon. He painted until his last days. He died at the age of 82 on 13 April 1996.

The mountain is northeast of the city's downtown and, in its majority, is publicly owned. In 1996, Jumbo was purchased from private landowners and protected from development. Funding for this purchase came from an open space bond, federal and non-profit agencies and thousands of local contributors. Additional land parcels have been purchased since then, increasing the easement to its current 1,800 acres. Natural History Glacial Lake Missoula Between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago, Glacial Lake Missoula formed when an ice sheet blocked the Clark Fork River, damming up the river's water back into the valleys of western Montana.\\"Glacial Lake Missoula\\" The dam would periodically burst causing a flood of water to rush across Idaho, Washington and Oregon to the Pacific Ocean. This lake contained about of water, half the volume of Lake Michigan. These dramatic drops in water levels caused the distinct glacial lake shoreline marks that are still visible from the floor of the Missoula Valley on the face of Mount Jumbo and neighboring Mount Sentinel.\\"Glacial Lake Missoula's shoreline\\" NPS Photo) Naming David Thompson, an English- Canadian fur trader, ignoring the Salish name already given, renamed the hill 'Brown Knowl' when he climbed in on February 26, 1812. Later, eastern settlers thought Mount Jumbo looked like a sleeping elephant. Locals saw the landform as a reclining elephant with its rump in the Clark Fork and its trunk pointing north toward the Rattlesnake Mountains; the round grassy mountain became known as 'Elephant Hill.' Miners christened a nearby copper mine 'Jumbo Lode' in honor of Barnum and Bailey's most famous attraction Jumbo, the largest elephant in the world, which Barnum acquired in 1882. The feature was later renamed Mount Jumbo. In the 19th Century, Jesuit priests that settled in the Missoula Valley referred to the mountain as Mount Loyola after St. Ignatius of Loyola. The Roman Catholic school named Loyola Sacred Heart, founded by Jesuit priests, was then opened in Missoula in 1873. Protecting Mount Jumbo In 1995, Missoula citizens approved a $5 million bond to preserve open, natural areas in the county. A year later, $2 million from that bond and another $1.5 million raised by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the U.S. Forest Service, Five Valleys Land Trust, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and local residents was used to purchase the majority of the mountain. This initial portion included 1,465 acres. Since then, additional land purchases have opened a total of 1,800 acres across Mount Jumbo to public access as well as wildlife preservation. The primary reason for protecting Mount Jumbo in 1996 was that a dense subdivision had been approved for the mountain's saddle. Mount Jumbo's saddle is identified as an essential winter-feeding habitat for elk herds. Of the elk herds living near Missoula the herd on Jumbo is considered the most restricted in its movements. Most parts of the mountain are closed during the winter to protect the elk that are under more stress at this time of year due to harsh weather and decreased food availability. The northern portion of Mount Jumbo is closed Dec. 1 until May 1, while the southern part is closed Dec. 1 to March 15.\\"Winter Closures Press Release 2010\\" A stabilization in Jumbo's herd size has been observed since the winter closures began in 1997.\\"Elk Herds Around Missoula\\" Invasive weeds such as spotted knapweed, leafy spurge, cheatgrass, sulfur cinquefoil, Dyer's Woad and Dalmatian toadflax are established across Mount Jumbo. Numerous management programs are working to combat the invasive species spread. A non-profit organization called Working Dogs, has trained dogs to detect Dyer's Woad. After 10 years of detection work the number of this invasive plant has dropped from thousands to only 7 plants per year. Community weed-pulls organized by Missoula City as well as student, conservation and other private groups work to remove thousands of pounds of weeds from the mountain's face every year. Sheep have also been used as a management tool to graze on the unwanted species, although their efficacy is doubtful.‚ÄúMt.

It was founded by feminist, writer, and advocate Felice Schwartz who served as Catalyst's president for 31 years. Catalyst's stated mission is to ‚Äúaccelerate progress for women through workplace inclusion.‚Äù Recent topics of focus include: board diversity; gender, race and ethnicity; inclusive cultures; LGBTQ; men and equality; the gender pay gap; sexual harassment; and unconscious bias. Catalyst also offers consulting services to supporter organizations seeking to improve workplace culture, diversity and inclusion initiative outcomes, and representation of women in their organizations. In addition to research activities, Catalyst has launched targeted initiatives to increase the number of women in leadership positions (Catalyst CEO Champions For Change, Catalyst Women on Board), enlist men's support for gender equality (Men Advocating Real Change/MARC), and celebrate individuals and organizations that are positive role models for change (Catalyst Awards, Catalyst Canada Honours). History = Founding = In 1951, after her father died, Felice Schwartz joined her brother Theodore Nierenberg to help turn around their father's failing business. Married and a mother, Schwartz worked as the vice president of production until they sold the business for a small profit three-and-a-half years later. The experiences Schwartz gained while working and raising a family spurred her to found Catalyst in 1962 with the stated mission, ‚Äúto bring to our country‚Äôs needs the unused abilities of intelligent women who want to combine work and family.‚Äù = The Early Years: 1960s = The 1960s saw Catalyst focused on promoting job-sharing programs and collecting and disseminating information to women who were interested in pursuing a career. In 1966, Catalyst partnered with the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare to launch a pilot job-sharing program for women. Twenty-five jobs as a welfare case worker were opened for 50 women. In 1971, Part-Time Social Workers in Public Welfare was published showing that the 50 part-time women were 89% as productive as full-time case workers and had one-third as much turnover as full-time case workers. = The 1970s & 1980s = As more women entered the workforce, Catalyst shifted its focus to topics such as dual career families, child care and women on corporate boards. Catalyst branched out from the public sector into the private sector, gaining corporate supporters. Schwartz became a more prominent voice in the women's movement. She authored numerous articles, was interviewed by the media and co-authored her first book, How to Go to Work When Your Husband Is Against It, Your Children Aren‚Äôt Old Enough, and There‚Äôs Nothing You Can Do Anyhow, along with her Catalyst colleagues Margaret H. Schifter and Susan S. Gillotti. She launched the Catalyst Awards to recognize women board directors. And, Catalyst established the Corporate Child Care Resource to monitor child care activities around the country and report on best practices. = The Mommy Track Controversy = Schwartz was a prolific writer but is most known for her 1989 article, Management Women and the New Facts of Life published in Harvard Business Review. Schwartz sparked a national debate by stating that ‚Äúthe cost of employing women in management is greater than the cost of employing men,‚Äù and suggesting that employers create two tracks for women, one for the career focused and one for the family focused. In response to Schwartz's article, the New York Times published 'Mommy Career Track' Sets Off a Furor, and branded Schwartz as the ‚Äúmommy track‚Äù creator. The Times article quoted prominent feminists who called the idea of two career paths ‚Äúhorrifying‚Äù and ‚Äúdamaging to women‚Äôs advancement.‚Äù Critics claimed the article validated the idea that women could have a family or a career but not both. Adding to the controversy was the lack of corroborating evidence for Schwartz's assertions. Her critics stated, If this is such hot stuff, where's the documentation? Schwartz claimed that her article was misinterpreted, saying, \\"I violated the politically correct thing by saying that women are not just like men. What I said then and still say is that women face many, many obstacles in the workplace that men do not face. I was saying to that group of men at the top, 'Rather than let women's talents go to waste, do something about it.'\\" In 1992, Schwartz published the book, Breaking with Tradition: Women and Work, The New Facts of Life, a response and expansion of the \\"mommy track\\" idea. Ten years after the original article was published, Schwartz's son Tony revisited the debate and offered up some insights from the controversy. In his article, Tony Schwartz argues that his mother's idea of dividing women into two categories was misguided, but her argument that to retain women companies need to give them more flexibility to manage a career and family, was on point. = The End of the Schwartz Era = After 31 years at the helm of Catalyst, Schwartz retired in 1993. She was in failing health and passed away in 1996 at the age of 71. Shortly thereafter, her final book was published, The Armchair Activist: Simple Yet Powerful Ways to Fight the Radical Right, co-authored with Suzanne K. Levine. = 1993 and Beyond = Since the Schwartz era and through its next three presidents, Catalyst expanded its offerings and geographic footprint. In 1993, the Board appointed Sheila Wellington, a former secretary of Yale University, to become the new president and CEO. As the leader of Catalyst, Wellington instituted more rigorous research standards, expanded Catalyst studies to include non-US geographies and women of color, and launched the annual Census of Women Board Directors, which became one of Catalyst's signature studies. Wellington resigned in 2003 to accept a position at New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business. In 2003, Ilene H. Lang assumed the role of president. Lang was a seasoned tech industry executive. She was the founding CEO of AltaVista Internet Software Inc., a First Light Capital venture partner, and a previous senior executive at Lotus Development Corporation. During her tenure, Lang further expanded Catalyst globally, opening offices in Europe, India, Australia and Japan. In 2014, Lang stepped down, and Deborah Gillis was named President & CEO. A Canadian, Gillis was the first non-American President & CEO. Prior to joining Catalyst, she worked in the public sector for the governments of Nova Scotia and Ontario and as a consultant for PricewaterhouseCoopers and Grant Thornton. In 2018, Deborah Gillis stepped down to accept the position of President & CEO of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) Foundation, and Ilene H. Lang resumed her former leadership role as Catalyst's Interim President & CEO. In August 2018, Lorraine Hariton became President & CEO.  Organization  = Leadership = Catalyst's President & CEO is Lorraine Hariton, who previously held senior-level positions in Silicon Valley, as well as leadership roles across the private, nonprofit, and government sectors, assumed the role of President & CEO on September 1, 2018. The Board of Directors Chair is Cathy Engelbert, CEO of Deloitte. Catalyst is governed by a Board of Directors that includes 36 companies from a variety of industries including: oil and gas, consumer products, retail, restaurants, accounting, consulting, business services, financial services, technology, travel, aerospace and defense, engineering, law, pharmaceuticals, health, and telecommunications. = Supporters = Catalyst receives funding for research and ongoing operations from more than 800 supporter organizations across the globe. = Regions = Catalyst has operations in the United States, Canada, Europe, and across the globe. Major Initiatives = Catalyst CEO Champions For Change = Launched on International Women's Day in 2017, the Catalyst CEO Champions For Change initiative showcases commitments by CEOs to advancing all women, including women of color, into more leadership positions in their companies and on their boards. To participate, Catalyst asks CEOs to publicly declare their support, take a pledge of organizational and personal commitments, and report their company's progress each year against established diversity metrics. The first report on the participating companies‚Äô progress was released in November 2017. = Catalyst Awards = Originally begun in 1976 to celebrate individual women board members, the Catalyst Award shifted to recognizing individual organizations in 1987. Since then, the award has recognized corporations and the specific programs they've created to recruit, develop, and advance women. Company initiatives are evaluated on seven criteria: strategy and rationale, senior leadership activities, accountability and transparency, communication, employee engagement, innovation, and measurable results. Catalyst has recognized 94 initiatives at 85 organizations from around the world since 1987. To be considered for the award, companies must submit an application. For each applicant, the Catalyst Award Evaluation Committee conducts research and phone interviews before narrowing the field to a few organizations. For the selected companies, the Committee conducts further research via onsite visits. The Committee and Catalyst executive leadership determine the winners. Initiatives are publicly celebrated at the annual Catalyst Awards Conference and Dinner held in New York City. The 2018 awards dinner had more than 2,000 attendees, including executives from global corporations, professional firms, governments, NGOs, and educational institutions.

The company, headquartered in Plano, Texas, was founded in 1993 by Charles Ragus and employed roughly 250 people in 2013. When AdvoCare switched from multi-level marketing to single- level direct selling in 2019, it claimed a network of approximately 100,000 independent distributors.  History  Charles Ragus founded AdvoCare in 1993 as a multi-level marketing (MLM) company that distributes dietary supplement products. The name AdvoCare is short for \\"Advocates Who Care\\". Before founding AdvoCare, Ragus worked as a regional vice president for Fidelity Union Insurance, and as a multi-level marketing (MLM) distributor for Herbalife. He had initially founded the MLM company Omnitrition International in 1989. Ragus briefly played defensive end for the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs in the 1960s. He died in 2001 at the age of 58.Obituary Central Archive Advocare had 5 presidents/managers from 2001 - 2007 Todd Cash - fired February 2005 Lance Wimmer fired after 4 months Bob Ulrich 2005 - May 2007 In May 2007, Richard H. Wright became president and CEO of AdvoCare. Wright had previously served as Chief of Staff for US Representative Jim McCrery. In October 2019, the FTC ruled that Advocare was a pyramid scheme that swindled hundreds of thousands of consumers. According to the FTC, AdvoCare rewarded distributors not for selling product but for recruiting other distributors to spend large sums of money pursuing the business opportunity, and nearly all of them lost money after expenses. In a landmark settlement, AdvoCare and its former chief executive agreed to pay $150 million for consumer refunds and were banned from all multi-level marketing. Two of AdvoCare‚Äôs top promoters also settled with the FTC for $4 million, most of which was suspended, based upon their inability to pay, and were also banned from multi-level marketing.  Products  AdvoCare sells health shakes, bodybuilding supplement, dietary supplements, and related products. AdvoCare sells products under the brand names Trim, Active, Well, Performance Elite, Fit, and 24 Day Challenge.  Business  Prior to July 2019, AdvoCare was a multi-level marketing company. Citing closed-door discussions with the Federal Trade Commission, AdvoCare ceased operating as a multi-level marketing company, and instead began only compensating distributors for sales of products to consumers. According to Advocare‚Äôs 2015 income disclosure statement, the company had 623,003 distributors who had purchased product or received a check that year. Among them, 28% (177,443) earned a check from the company in 2015, thereby being classified as ‚Äúactive distributors‚Äù; active distributors received a total of 1,294,716 checks with an average annual compensation of $1,586, not including expenses. For 2016, the company reported that 570,289 distributors had purchased product or received a check; 157,905 were active and their average annual compensation had declined to $1,429. The average annual compensation for active distributors in 2012 was $1,781. In a 2010 court case Advocare said that it had around 60,000 active distributors, and had sold approximately 350,000 distributorships since 2003. (page 23) AdvoCare is a member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association (DSA), and participated in the 2010 DSA Code of Ethics Communication Initiative. AdvoCare President Richard Wright served on the DSA Board of Directors in 2011. Sponsorships and endorsements According to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Advocare used endorsements from professional athletes, title sponsorship of professional sporting events, conferences, podcasts, and more to pitch what it called a life-changing business opportunity that was in fact a pyramid scheme that swindled hundreds of thousands of consumers. Trevor Bayne's AdvoCare-branded Ford Mustang in NASCAR competition. AdvoCare's contracted celebrity endorsers have included soccer player Carli Lloyd; Major League Baseball pitcher Doug Fister; CrossFit champion Rich Froning; NFL players Andy Dalton, Philip Rivers, Alex Smith, Sam Bradford, Wes Welker, and New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who was described by ESPN as the face of the company. Celebrity endorsers are said to be central to \\"the Bulletproof Shield,\\" a key sales and recruitment technique used by the company: distributors place themselves at the center of a chart illustrating the company's endorsements and members of its scientific and medical advisory board, and deflects questions about the company by replying, \\"Well, I don't know about (X), but what I do know is\\" that particular athletes or doctors have endorsed AdvoCare. From 2009 until 2013, AdvoCare was the title sponsor of the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana. The 2013 game was known as the AdvoCare V100 Bowl. In 2012, AdvoCare partnered with the Major League Soccer team FC Dallas and became its jersey sponsor. In 2014, AdvoCare secured the naming rights of a professional sports practice facility located at The Greenbrier in West Virginia. The facility was named the AdvoCare Sports Performance Center and hosted the 2014 training camp for the New Orleans Saints. AdvoCare also became the title sponsor of the 2014 Texas Bowl. In 2016, AdvoCare was to sponsor the Texas Kickoff and Cowboys Classic games. From 2011 to 2016, AdvoCare sponsored several NASCAR racing teams and drivers, including Trevor Bayne and Roush Fenway Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and Xfinity Series, as well as races at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway.  Controversy  In July 2008, Olympic swimmer Jessica Hardy tested positive for the banned breathing enhancer, clenbuterol. Hardy said she had never heard of the substance, attributing the positive result to either a tainted supplement or sabotage. At the time, Hardy had been taking the supplement Arginine Extreme, which she had received for free from AdvoCare in exchange for making product testimonials, and she claimed in a subsequent lawsuit that the company's product was tainted. AdvoCare sued Hardy for making false claims. An arbitration hearing reduced Hardy's suspension after a scientific expert testified that the AdvoCare product was tainted. AdvoCare disputed the panel's findings, saying that two independent laboratories had not found any evidence of Clenbuterol in the supplements. In 2009, a Dallas County jury awarded $1.9 million in damages against AdvoCare after finding that the company had engaged in deceptive trade practices and unfairly canceled agreements with two of its distributors. According to the lawsuit, litigants Bruce and Teresa Badgett of Arlington, Texas, had been active and profitable marketers of AdvoCare products for more than a dozen years before their distributorship was canceled by the company in 2006 \\"based upon vague and trumped-up charges.\\" The jury found that AdvoCare engaged in false, misleading, or deceptive practices that damaged the Badgetts and that the termination provisions of the distributor contract with AdvoCare were unconscionable, according to court documents. AdvoCare disputed the ruling and on April 30, 2010, filed to appeal the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs were not customers and therefore did not fit the statutory definition necessary to be covered under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. The appeal was dismissed on March 13, 2012 and the company was ordered to reimburse the Badgett's for court costs related to their defense in the appeal case. AdvoCare ceased offering KickStart Spark, targeted to youth age 4‚Äì11, after pediatricians had expressed concerns about the product containing 60 mg of caffeine. AdvoCare was also the subject of criticism for its marketing at youth athletic events. In 2005, the company paid $5,000 to sponsor a high school wrestling tournament in Sacramento but after negative publicity, AdvoCare officials said they would not sponsor any more school events. Wendy Miller of the Beaumont Weight Control Center said AdvoCare's Herbal Cleanse is probably safe for many users, but she suggested that the same results could be achieved without the products. In March 2016, Advocare was the subject of a critical expos√© in ESPN The Magazine. The expos√©e argues that the company and a small number of distributors at the top of a distribution network makes most of its money from the signing-up of new distributors rather than sales of the product, while exaggerating the likelihood of financial success of distributors when only a few make a significant amount of money; that the company creates a cult-like atmosphere of not questioning the company's claims or the probability of financial success in new distributors, to the point where distributors will shun friends and family members who do so; and that the company is internally driven by divisions over the company's strong use of religious affiliation as part of its business model, with more devout members of the organization using it to gain and hold power in the organization and over its members.

This is in contrast to most carbon fiber composites, which are made of larger continuous layers that are 'laid up' one at a time, often manually. Forged composite allows for a higher range of shapes to be formed with precision, relative to traditional carbon fiber. It was originally developed jointly between Lamborghini, Callaway Golf Company, and the Lamborghini Lab. It was unveiled at the 2010 Paris Motor Show in a Lamborghini concept car. The United States trademark for forged composite was filed on July 13, 2010, in the category Toys and Sporting Goods Products by Callaway Golf, while the trademark for Forged Composites was registered in 2018 in the automotive category by Lamborghini. Forged composite contains higher fiber volume content, which combined with higher variation in strand orientation, increases the average strength and reduce variability over standard carbon fiber. The material is one-third as dense as metal titanium but stronger, and consists of chopped carbon fiber tows that are sandwiched between two layers of filmed resin. It uses about 500,000 intertwined fibers per square inch. The fibers contain intertwined and folded sheets of carbon atoms aligned with the length of the fiber, and the intertwining improved the fiber strength. The result is improved load carrying capacity as measured in bending per unit of mass. Due to its chopped nature, it can be molded into much more complex geometries than traditional carbon fiber composites, and is suitable to make three-dimensional parts and parts which feature complex details such as thickness transitions, holes, compound curvature, etc. Lamborghini uses forged composite for structural components, and interior trim and seats of its cars, the latter contributing to its winning of the JEC Composites Innovation Award for Automotive Interiors in 2016, due to the material's unique appearance. Union Binding Company entered a partnership with the Lamborghini ACSL in order to develop a snowboard binding using forged composite technology. In 2014, the all-forged composite \\"Union FC\\" snowboard binding was launched and subsequently won the 2014 ISPO Product of the Year Award. Callaway claims the use of forged composite results in an average about greater distance per drive relative to traditional carbon fiber when used in its driving golf clubs. The material can contribute to reduced weight in vehicles.  Forged Composite Look  Forged composite look demonstrated in engine bay cover prototype for Lamborghini Aventador The 2010 debut of the Sesto Elemento showcased the new marbled look of carbon fiber obtained from using forged composite, which has since become a highly desirable aesthetic for carbon fiber parts, in particular in automotive and consumer goods. Unlike the traditional woven carbon fiber look, the forged composite look is marbled and always unique due to the random nature of the material.

The tel, unconventionally, has two peaks, and between them is a field. The site is just south of the convergence of three small waterways; the Hadera Stream, Wadi Ara, and Nahal Yitzhak, where they continue westward as the Hadera Stream. Tel Zeror is sometimes identified with Zrar, a city mentioned in the description of Thutmosis III's conquests, from the fifteenth century BCE. Another possibility is that the site is Machtar, from the same description. History and Archaeology Tel Zeror was first excavated in 1928 by John Garstang, who spent a single day at the site. It was the first proper tel in the Sharon Plain to be excavated. In the 1960s, a Japanese expedition spent three seasons uncovering a fortified, 50-dunam city, and returned in 1974 for an additional season. =Bronze Age= The Middle Bronze Age city was fortified with a city wall, built of earth, mud-bricks and stone, and surrounded by a moat. The wall was 4.5 meters wide, and a watch tower was incorporated in it. The moat was 10 meters wide. The depth of its lowest course is unknown, because the excavators reached groundwater and could not dig further. At some point the wall was destroyed and then renewed. Tel Zeror seems to have been abandoned from the 18th century BCE, and not resettled until the early 15th century BCE. By the Late Bronze Age (LB), the site was unfortified, but boasted large buildings and an industrial copper-working quarter with smelting furnaces, crucibles, and large amounts of copper slag. Cypriot ceramic ware was found in this quarter, probably originating from the same source as the copper itself, that is, Cyprus. Two types of LB burials were found at the site; graves lined with cut stones that contained burial offerings, and pit burials. In both types, positioning was on the back, facing west. Tentative dating suggests the 13th century BCE. =Iron Age= In the Iron Age (11th century BCE), the site had a large mud-brick citadel, and a casemate wall. Four room houses of this period were discovered, as well. A bowl inscribed in ancient Hebrew was found on the southern hill. The inscription reads \\"to the god Semech\\" or possibly \\"El is my support\\". Iron Age burials in storage jars were found at Tel Zeror. The site was continually occupied until it was destroyed in the eighth century BCE by the invading Assyrians, and then resettled later in the sixth century BCE. =Hellenistic-Byzantine Periods= During the Hellenistic period there was a rounded watch tower on the northern hill, with a spiral staircase, for an agriculturally oriented settlement (\\"manor farm\\"). In the Byzantine period, the area south of the tel was populated. =Middle Ages= In the Mamluke period there was a town on the southern hill called Tel a-Dhurer. In the 13th and 14th centuries CE, the northern hill became a Muslim burial ground. Burials were simple or stone-lined, bodies positioned on the side, with the face to the south. Tel a-Dhurer existed until 1948.

GTE Sylvania, 433 U.S. 36 (1977), was an antitrust decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. It widened the scope of the \\"rule of reason\\" to exclude the jurisdiction of antitrust laws. Facts Facing declining sales, GTE-Sylvania attempted to reduce the number of competing Sylvania retailers by \\"limit[ing] the number of franchises granted for any given area [of the country] and requir[ing] each franchisee to sell his Sylvania products only from the location or locations at which he was franchised.\\" 433 U.S., at 38. When Continental was denied such a franchise, they filed a lawsuit alleging violation of the Sherman Act. Continental's chances looked good, because the Supreme Court had held such restrictions to be subject to a per se rule in United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365 (1967). Judgment The Supreme Court overruled Schwinn (which had itself been a change in course from White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253 (1963), where the court had refused to adopt such a rule, 433 U.S., at 47) and held that such business practices must be analyzed under the rule of reason. Noting that \\"per se rules of illegality are appropriate only when they relate to conduct that is manifestly anticompetitive,\\" 433 U.S., at 49-50, the court concluded that GTE's behavior transgressed the Sherman Act only if it was an unreasonable restraint of trade that would diminish competition and promote inefficiency. Significance The Sylvania case became the first shot in the court's march to the \\"Chicago School\\" version of antitrust economics as the touchstone of antitrust law. Attributed to the influence of Robert Bork, summarized in The Antitrust Paradox, and Richard Posner, explained in Antitrust Law (both published in 1978), these legal scholars popularized what Chicago economists had produced. The initial ground was broken by economist George McGee, who reanalyzed the biggest antitrust ruling in history, the Supreme Court's split up of Standard Oil in 1911. McGee disputed Standard Oil's engagement in predatory pricing, the linchpin of its antitrust violations. McGee's view is now widely criticized, by lawyers Christopher Leslie, Elizabeth Granitz, Benjamin Klein, economists James Dalton, Louis Esposito, and historians Ron Chernow, Daniel Yergin. Bork and Posner wrote books that advised attorneys and courts that McGee's paper showed antitrust's foundation was uncertain. Other Chicago economists who influenced antitrust debates in ways that narrowed and limited its legal basis include Ronald Coase, Gary Becker, and George Stigler. McGee was inspired to rethink antitrust law by his University of Chicago economics co-professor Aaron Director in the 1950s, according to Posner. Director was Milton Friedman's brother-in-law, and shared his agenda to move mainstream economics away from Keynesian macroeconomics and towards laissez-faire. The case staked out the ground for cases like Broadcast Music v. Columbia Broadcasting System, State Oil Co. v. Khan, Verizon v. Trinko, and Leegin v. PSKS.

It is called also simply called \\"‰∏äÊµ∑Â§ßÁÅ´\\" (Great Shanghai fire) by Chinese media or \\"Shanghai high-rise fire\\" and \\"Shanghai apartment building fire\\" by English media. was a fire on 15 November 2010 that destroyed a 28-story high-rise apartment building in the city of Shanghai, China, killing at least 58 people and injuring more than 70 others (with at least one source reporting more than 120 others injured). An investigation under the PRC State Council was announced on 16 November, the day after the fire, to determine the cause of the blaze. A preliminary finding by investigators concluded that sparks from welding work being done on the building, undertaken by unlicensed welders, ignited scaffolding around the structure, which led to the apartments' destruction. The municipal government also placed the blame on illegal multi- layered subcontracting, and detained four managers from several construction companies. In all, sixteen individuals have been arrested in connection to the fire, as well as four others accused of being unlicensed welders. The week after the fire, city officials announced a compensation plan for victims of the fire and their families. The fire also prompted the government to pass stricter regulations on the construction industry, as well as increased fire safety inspections. The New York Times reported that China suppressed several building complaints, and several journalists were detained after the fire. The Asia Times wrote that an alleged slow response by the government was criticized. Fire A video of the building on fire The fire began at 2:15 pm local time (06:15 UTC) around the tenth floor. The building, constructed in 1997, was located at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Yuyao Road in Shanghai's Jing'an District, and was being renovated at the time of the fire. Witnesses said that the fire started with construction materials and spread throughout the building. It took over 80 fire engines and several hours to contain the fire. Shanghai residents were able to see smoke from the fire several kilometres away. Firefighters were unable to hose water on the top of the -tall building from the ground. China Youth Daily reported that the contractor for the construction said the cause of the fire was probably sparks caused by welding work done on the 20th floor. Qiu Jingshu, a worker on the 18th floor, said sparks from welding being done on another building flew over and caused the scaffolding to catch fire. Afterward, it was \\"established\\" that the fire \\"was caused by unlicensed welders improperly operating their equipment\\", and several welders were arrested. =Rescue efforts= The apartment building on fire Firefighters were able to save over 100 people out of the 180 families inhabiting the high-rise apartment building. According to Al Jazeera, the fire began at the scaffolding that surrounded the building, but spread to the complex's main building of around 500 apartments. Xinhua News Agency said the fire was contained at about 6:30 p.m. local time (10:30 UTC), more than four hours after it began. Three helicopters had been called in to assist in the rescue, Photos from the helicopters but were prevented by thick smoke generated by the fire. The upper portion of the building was beyond the reach of fire apparatus; the blaze was brought under control only after firefighters set up hoses atop a nearby building. In all, 25 fire stations and over 100 fire appliances were mobilised in response to the incident. Television coverage of the event showed people holding on to scaffolding around the building, and some were able to climb down to safety. One worker on the 28th floor said that workers were adding insulation to the building when the fire broke out. Victims not in hospitals, as well as evacuees from three surrounding city blocks, were sent to public buildings, including a school and a stadium, until their housing situation could be addressed. Casualties The building housed around 440 people, mainly retired teachers. An early report showed that the ages of those injured in the fire range from 3 to 85, with the majority (64.5%) over the age of 50. Most of the injured appeared to be elderly residents or children, and it was confirmed that the youngest victim of the fire was 16 months old. A firefighter said that 57 of the 58 killed had died inside the building. Earliest reports put the death toll at eight, but Xinhua later revised the count several times, and then confirmed 53 deaths by 16 November. 26 bodies were identified using DNA tests. Some media outlets reported 79 fatalities by adding the number of identified victims to the number of previously reported fatalities, although Xinhua later said that the 26 identified were included amongst the 53. As of 24 November 58 people (22 males and 36 females) were officially reported dead while 56 people remained missing. The Global Times reported that, as of 28 December 2010, 71 people had been injured, and 36 were still missing. Of the deceased, 57 were identified by DNA tests early on, while one male, from Japan, was still being identified when the official death count was released. A doctor at Shanghai's Jing'an Hospital said that over 20 people injured in the fire had been admitted, many suffering from asphyxia caused by smoke inhalation. State media reports said the hospital was treating 55 survivors, including nine in serious condition. At least 70 people, and possibly more than 120 people were reported to have been injured. According to BBC News, people who survived the blaze were searching hospitals for missing family and friends. As of 24 November 66 wounded people, 14 of which were in critical condition, were being treated at seven area medical centers. In all, nine hospitals received victims of the fire. The list of the dead was not released as the victims' families wanted privacy. Authorities said more than one-third of the families did not want the names of the deceased published. However, several newspapers listed some of the names of the dead. The artist Ai Weiwei compiled an unofficial list of the victims' names by contacting their relatives, along with officials and journalists. He claimed that the actual death toll was two more than the official count, but authorities did not provide access to the list of casualties. Response =Investigation= The structure after the fire was extinguished Meng Jianzhu, the Minister of Public Security, went to Shanghai to manage rescue operations. Jing'an officials set up temporary lodging and food at area hotels, and some survivors stayed at a gymnasium overnight. After the flames were extinguished, the Shanghai Municipal Government held a press conference about the damage caused by the fire. Liu Jinguo, Vice Minister of Public Security, described the firefighting as \\"a successful model\\", leading to a dispute by Chinese netizens. Later in the week of the fire, government officials began a drive to increase fire and safety inspections at buildings and construction sites. They also said that improvements would be made to the city's firefighting capabilities. Local residents said that fire safety requirements at the high-rise were lax, and that workers often tossed used cigarettes into the building's hallways. Week- long safety inspections were done on the two other buildings of the apartment complex, both of which were unharmed. The several hundred people living in those buildings were expected to be allowed to move back on 20 December 2010. Until then, the survivors would live in 17 nearby hotels. According to Ming Pao, family members of the victims were dissatisfied with the official investigation and held a sit-in protest, calling for a fair judgement. Some locals blamed the official rescue work by comparing it with a large emergency response exercise on a 330-meter building several days before, and the successful firefighting for a blaze at Shanghai World Financial Center in 2007. Others blamed an ineffective firefighting system for the high death toll, and were dissatisfied that they were not given more details about the fire. In Beijing, authorities halted renovation projects similar to the one being done on the apartment in Shanghai shortly after the blaze. The projects, intended to save energy by installing insulation, were stopped on 19 November, pending safety evaluations of the work. The insulation is still flammable, despite the use of fire retardants. Shanghai officials temporarily stopped such renovations after the fire, but later allowed them to resume. On 20 December 2010, the mayor of Shanghai, Han Zheng, said that the city would crack down on unfair practices of construction companies and contracting firms. Han said that there is little regulation of the construction industry and that certain companies have had advantages over other companies when being awarded contracts. On 11 January 2011, Shanghai authorities placed into effect a new set of regulations aimed at better official supervision of construction companies. The city will also require that such companies will not be permitted to have any non-official relationship with local government offices after one year. Some media organizations had been questioning the connections between Jing'an District's government and the contracting groups involved in the fire, leading to accusations of corruption. =Compensation= On 23 November, it was announced that the families of each victim of the fire would receive 960,000 yuan in compensation for the ordeal. The compensation would include 650,000 yuan for every death and 310,000 yuan in financial assistance from the government and charities. Zhang Renliang, the top official of Jing'an District, said that Shanghai residents and foreign workers would be compensated equally. Survivors of the blaze would be fully compensated for the loss of possessions and property. Some who lost relatives in the disaster, however, were not satisfied with the announcement. They said that the compensation plan was not enough to pay for another apartment in the district, and that they would rather have a new apartment than the money. =Media censorship allegations= Hong Kong-based Sing Tao Daily and Singapore-based Lianhe Zaobao reported that four journalists from Xinjing News (Êñ∞‰∫¨Êä•), China Daily, Reuters and a local newspaper were detained for one hour as security forces demanded a guarantee for positive news coverage by the journalists, before they were to interview families of the victims at a funeral parlour. The reporters wrote about their detainment on two websites. A Chinese webmaster said that the authorities demanded for Chinese websites to cut down on their reporting of the fire, and only allowed usage of the official Xinhua news source. The New York Times reported that Chinese website Huasheng Online was blocked by government censors after criticizing the country's real-estate industry. Responsibility Han Zheng said on 22 November that the city was largely responsible for the disaster. He said, \\"Poor supervision of the city's construction industry was one of the causes behind the high-rise apartment building fire. And we are responsible for that.\\" Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said Han was trying \\"to do some damage control to dispel anger and to comfort the families of the victims and the Shanghai people.\\" Luo Lin, chief of the PRC State Administration of Work Safety, blamed the fire on illegal employment methods, poor project oversight, and incompetent, inexperienced workers. On the day following the fire, Meng Jianzhu said he wanted an investigation into the fire to determine who was responsible for it, so those at fault could be punished appropriately. He told rescue officials to be meticulous in their efforts and that information regarding the fire should be released to the public. He also asked local governments across China to take preventative measures against such fires, including building inspections. A team of investigators, led by the State Administration of Work Safety, was formed under the PRC State Council to look into the incident. Many details about the \\"November 15 Relief and Rehabilitation Working Team\\" have not been publicly announced. The investigation into the fire made a preliminary conclusion that negligence by unlicensed welders on the tenth floor caused the bamboo scaffolding and attached nylon netting to catch fire, which subsequently spread to the entire structure. Shanghai authorities detained eight individuals on 16 November, at least four of whom were accused of being unlicensed welders. As of 19 November, a total of twelve individuals were being held by officials in connection to the blaze, including four more who were detained that day. The four were representatives of Jiayi Building Decoration, a part of renovation contractor Jing'an Construction, Shanghai Jing'an Construction Supervision, and the apartment management company. On 24 December 2010, Shanghai officials announced that three government employees had been taken into custody in connection with the fire. Those detained were accused of abusing their authority to permit illicit construction practices to occur. The three were reported to be Gao Weizhong, director of Jing'an's construction and transportation commission; Zhang Quan, of the commission's main office; and Zhou Jianmin, of the organization's construction department. =Cause of fire= The fire may have been caused by the accidental ignition of polyurethane foam insulation used on the building's outer walls. In China, the foam is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of flame retardants, and the foam produces toxic gases such as hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which magnified the ferocity of a 2009 fire that consumed the center. In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be switched out in favor of fire-resistant materials. Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor fire sprinkler system in high rise buildings. Public mourning Mourners surrounded the destroyed building, bringing flowers and wreaths. Local citizens put flowers and wreaths near the site, and offered prayers around the destroyed building. Mourners, including Government officials, came bearing chrysanthemums. At one point, the crowd stretched around down the road. According to Xinhua, about 10,000 people attended a public mourning at the site on 21 November, seven days after the fire; mourners left large amounts of flowers surrounding the burnt building. The seventh day after death is the day that Chinese people believe the souls of the dead return to their relatives before departing, and mourners at the site burned paper and made a feast for the deceased, in accordance with Chinese tradition. During the event, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra played \\"Ave Maria\\" and monks recited s≈´tras at a local temple. On 19 December 2010, the 35th day following the fire, authorities were reported to be detaining mourners who were visiting the site. According to Chinese legend, souls of the dead also visit humans 35 days after death, but police were taking mourners away on buses. Local officials did not provide an explanation for the event.

Classically trained from an early age his roots are within the field of Electronic Dance Music. His interest for music first started at age 5 when he received piano lessons by academic piano teacher Andre Terebesi. Today Terebesi is a professor at the Peter Cornelius Conservatory in Mainz, Germany. Age 13 Stenzel changed to church organ and received his church organist diploma age 15. Graduating from the Protestant church in Frankfurt. In 1990 he released his first single \\"Recall IV - Contrast\\" through Zyx Records. His partners failed to credit him as a writer and because of his lack of knowledge of the music industry, only \\"mixed by Torsten Stenzel‚Äù appeared on the credits. In 1992 Stenzel became A & R-Manager for the underground record label \\"Crash Records\\". It was his first job in the recording business and together with his partner at that time - Zied Jouini - he became responsible for the label. Their first release N.U.K.E - NanaN.U.K.E-Nana went straight to No. 1 in Italy and No. 3 in Benelux. In 1993 Stenzel started his collaboration with DJ Taucher, who had weekly shows at the legendary Music Hall in Frankfurt. The first release by the duo was the single Happiness. The second single Atlantis (1993: Planet Love Records) is still today considered a classic track within the EDM scene.  First Label (1993‚Äì1998)  In 1993 Stenzel founded his first own underground label 'Liquid Records'. He now had the freedom to release whatever he choose and, unbeknownst to him at the time, it proved a wise decision. Together with fellow German, producer Oliver Lieb, he started the project 'Paragliders'. During this period he kept working with renowned electronic artists such as Booka Shade, Dj Tatana, Dj Taucher, Talla 2XLC and DJ Sakin. Stenzel released over 40 Vinyl-singles through Liquid Records. = Taucher and Stenzel = In 1995 Stenzel bought the rights to 'Planet Love Records' in which he afore had been the A & R-Manager. He was now focused on developing his trance sounds together with compatriot Ralph-Armand Beck (aka. DJ Taucher). Their single 'Fantasy' was licensed to Sony Dancepool, and, surprisingly, it reached a top 50 position in the German media control charts. The third single 'Infinity' reached a top 50 position in Germany as well. Until 1997 the duo remixed over 52 artists and were named the 'worldwide third best remixers' by readers of the magazine Raveline. Stenzel and Taucher reworked tracks by amongst others Faithless - 'God is a DJ', which in several countries reached a number 1 position in the charts. The Stenzel-Taucher productions were also licensed by famed British producer and Dj Paul Oakenfold for some of his compilations. Furthermore, the duo also released productions under their alias' 'Red Light District' and 'Diver & Ace'. = Commercial Breakthrough - Dj Sakin & Friends (1999‚Äì2006) = In 1998 Stenzel released the track 'Protect Your Mind' together with yet another fellow countryman, producer Sakin Bozkurt (Dj Sakin). It was the first single under the new project 'Sakin & Friends' and it was released through 'Planet Love Records'. They had produced a club version based on the film music by composer James Horner. Through 4 months several European Dj's played the track frequently and it quickly became a clubhit. In 1999 Stenzel licensed the track to the underground label 'Overdose' and produced a remix - (Suspicious Remix). Shortly after a single with the new remix was released it entered the German charts without a music video or further promotion. It became a fast selling item and after only one week it rose in the German music sales charts onto a number 3 position. In the German Dance Charts it hit a number 1 position, and additionally received Silver, Gold and Platin records in several European countries. It also reached number 4 in the UK charts in March 1999. Today more than 700.000 copies of 'Protect Your Mind' have been sold and the track is considered to be one of the most popular trance productions ever released! The second single from the duo - 'Nomansland' featured the melody of an old TV show that Stenzel loved as a child (The Adventures of David Belfort). 'Nomansland' reached a 10th position in Germany and 16th position in The United Kingdom. It was difficult to continue the achievements of Sakin & Friends after the runaway success of 'Protect Your Mind', but even their debut album 'Walk on Fire' charted successfully. As a result of this success Stenzel decided to fulfill his dream and explore options outside of Germany. He moved to the Spanish Balearic island Ibiza and built a recording studio in his home close to San Jose. = York = After setting up the studio in Ibiza, Stenzel worked promptly on his different projects. Among these York that he had started in 1997 with his brother J√∂rg Stenzel. Their first single The Awakening reached an 11th position in the UK charts. It became the first trance track that had the electric guitar as lead instrument. With more than 250.000 sold copies 'The Awakening' became one of the best selling singles that did not reach a top 10 position in the United Kingdom. Their second single 'On The Beach' was released on the German producer Andreas Tomallas' (Talla 2XLC) label - 'Suck me Plasma'. It was later on licensed to Sony Music Germany and Manifesto in The United Kingdom. 'On The Beach' was a conversion of British singer-songwriter Chris Rea. It instantly reached a top 3 position in Germany, United Kingdom and US. Stenzel had his second huge hit following 'Protect Your Mind'. Furthermore, Chris Rea was so positively affected by the conversion - which had sold more copies than the original from 1986 - that he helped promoting the track with a performance in the British 'Top of The Pops' show. Chris Rea and Stenzel started writing songs together, among others the track 'Your Love is Setting Me Free' by Watermen Meets Chris Rea. = Moby = Stenzel has been a huge fan of Moby, since the release of the album Go in 1991. In 2001 Moby's manager contacted him and asked if he would be interested in remixing the new single Porcelain along with Rob Dougan, Futureshock and Force Mass Motion. Stenzel produced a deep Clubremix, that later on was released through Mute Records (US).Torsten Stenzel Remix = Ibiza Projects = In 1999, after a short time in Ibiza, word of mouth spread and the biggest German music channel VIVA sent reporters to interview Stenzel. Local Dj's and producers in Ibiza welcomed him and he then met Dj Sin Plomo, who was a resident Dj in the Space-Club (We Love Sundays) and the well known KM 5-Club. They started an intensive collaboration and had numerous releases together on different labels. Among these they released a series of KM 5 compilation albums on Richard Branson's label Virgin Records. Additionally Stenzel worked with Sin Plomo's friend Paul Lomax. Together they produced two records Islands and Sweet Love - two typical Balearic sound tunes. Stenzel managed to get his Chillout Productions on the famous Cafe del Mar and Buddha Bar compilations. He also released an album and several singles in co- operation with Dj and producer Matt Caseli - resident Dj at Ibiza's most famous nightclub 'Pacha'. \\\\- 2004 Stenzel met German Dj and producer Sven Greiner (Dj Shog) on Ibiza. Together they founded the record label '7th Sense Recordings' where they released various new trance projects under alias' such as Mandala Bros., Jolly Harbour and San Jose. During his time in Ibiza, he had his now extremely successful daughter Au/Ra, who is widely known for her single 'Panic Room'. = Tarja Turunen = In 2006 the Finnish rock singer and ex-front figure of the rock band Nightwish was searching for new songs for her first solo album. Torsten's Kenyan songwriter friend Adrian Zagoritis pitched her the track Iceflowers, taken from the second 'York' album 'Peace' (2004). Tarja liked the production and was interested in writing music with Stenzel. It was a music direction totally new for Torsten. Tarja had the idea to write her new album in Ibiza, and he organized, together with the Berlin Department of Universal Music, a writing camp where they flew in 10 writers from all over Europe. They wrote about 75% of the songs on her debut album My Winter Storm at this session. Stenzel wrote 5 songs for this album of which 3 - 'The Reign', 'Damned & Divine' and 'Lost Northern Star' - were recorded in Santa Monica at the Remote Control Studios of Academy Award-nominee Hans Zimmer. The album was released through Universal Music in 70 countries. It became a huge worldwide success and received several Gold and Platinum records in Finland, Russia and Germany. In 2010 Tarja released her second album What Lies Beneath. Stenzel wrote two tracks for this album; one of these being the song 'Naiad'. The album reached top 5 in the German sales chart. = Los Angeles = In 2006, Stenzel travelled to the US to promote the new album he produced with Jennifer Paige. He was introduced by Paige to musical genius and multi- Grammy winner, American Rick Nowels. After a short conversation Nowels wanted to hear the new songs produced with Jennifer Paige. He then asked Stenzel if he would be interested in playing keyboard for him as he was just completing new songs for the British girl band All Saints. Torsten eventually played keyboards on many of the songs including 'Chickfit', that was released as one of their 2007 singles off the album 'Studio One'. = The West Indies: The New Island - Antigua (2007‚Äì2019)= It was time for a change. Throughout the 1990s, Ibiza became more commercialised, mainstream and gradually lost appeal. The increasingly hedonistic lifestyle and overcrowding caused Stenzel and his family to seek greener pastures. As an avid world traveller, he had visited Thailand, Canada, Indonesia, South Africa and many other places while seeking the perfect home for his family. Their travels eventually brought them to a getaway vacation in Antigua. ‚ÄúWhen we came to Antigua‚Äù says Stenzel, ‚Äúwe said this could be the right place, it‚Äôs warm, and we wanted to escape from Ibiza because it was too crowded and expensive.‚Äù  Film Music  Arriving fresh in Antigua in late 2007, Torsten met the movie producer Rolant Hergert through an Antiguan friend. Rolant was shooting a new motion picture in Berlin called Fire. Torsten was invited to Berlin to score 'The Making of Fire'. After the producer heard his work, he replaced the original composer with Stenzel, who wrote the entire soundtrack in Antigua. Meanwhile, Stenzel made another soundtrack for a Caribbean documentary Vanishing Sail which won six awards, like the Caribbean Spirit award in 2015 . = Return of 'Planet Love Records' (2011‚Äì2019) = Late 2011 major Dutch EDM label Armada Music announced that they had joined forces with Torsten's Planet Love Records. From 1992 - 1998 Planet Love Records was the homebase of several of Torsten's most successful early EDM productions. Furthermore, influential and classic tracks by signed artist such as 'Dj Tatana', 'Taucher', 'Talla 2XLC' and 'Dj Sakin & Friends'. In 1998 Torsten put his work with 'Planet Love Records' on hiatus as the family moved to Ibiza for new adventures. Today the Planet Love Records production facility is situated on the Caribbean island, Antigua. Future plans for Planet Love Records and Armada Music are the release of the next artist album by York and the start of a new chillout compilation series. Furthermore, digital re-releasing several classic 'Planet Love Records' productions and new individual releases by signed artists. Start 2012, Torsten Stenzel and Armada Music released volume 1 of a new compilation of chillout, downtempo, lounge productions. The 'Planet Chill - Compiled by York' compilations will see vol. 1‚Äì5 released within 2012. Featuring productions by Torsten's long term producer colleagues, some of his own classic productions and brand new exclusive unreleased material. Vol. 1‚Äì3 offer productions by acts such as Torsten's much respected own project 'York' and among others, international star EDM producers 'Matt Darey', 'The Thrillseekers', 'Solarstone', 'Roger Shah', 'Ayla', 'Kai Tracid', 'tyDi' & 'Mike Foyle'. Start 2014, 'Planet Love Records' and sister-label 'Planet Love Classics' are now affiliated with Dutch record label Black Hole Recordings. An official announcement was made public on 20 January. The Black Hole management announced upcoming new releases via Planet Love Records by acts such as York, Kai Tracid, Steve Brian, Asheni, Jennifer Paige, Deep Voices and Doris Pearson. Furthermore, there will also be new 2016 remixes from tracks out of the Planet Love Classics catalogue and from his new Studio Album \\"Traveller\\". = Mike Oldfield - Tubular Beats = On February 1, 2013 world-renowned artist Mike Oldfield released the album Tubular Beats. As a collaboration between Mike Oldfield and Torsten Stenzel 'Tubular Beats' is a collection of some of the best known Oldfield tracks, remixed by Torsten under his York moniker. Unlike with previous club mixes, the album is a true two-sided collaboration between Oldfield and Stenzel, making use of parts from the original multitrack tapes as well as new parts played by Oldfield. The album took two years to be completed, Torsten used the Apollo 8 recording in the song \\"Let There Be light\\", this gave the song the York's touch. On \\"Never Too Far\\" they used a track that both wrote together for York's album \\"Islander\\", this result in one of the album's best songs, the peaceful background including Tarja Turunen voice invites the listener to a relaxation voyage.

Jesper Hoffmeyer (21 February 1942 ‚Äì 25 September 2019)Nekrolog: Biosemiotikeren Jesper Hoffmeyers historie ville v√¶re ut√¶nkelig i dag was a professor at the University of Copenhagen Institute of Biology, and a leading figure in the emerging field of biosemiotics. He was the President of the International Society for Biosemiotic Studies (ISBS) from 2005 to 2015, co-editor of the journal Biosemiotics and the Springer Book series in Biosemiotics. He authored the books Biosemiotics: An Examination into the Signs of Life and the Life of Signs and Signs of Meaning in the Universe and edited A Legacy for Living Systems: Gregory Bateson as Precursor to Biosemiotics. Biography Jesper Hoffmeyer was born in Slangerup, Denmark in 1942. He received his Cand. Scient. in biochemistry from the University of Copenhagen in 1967, and from 1967-1968 he was Science Fellow at the Institut de Biochemie G√©nerale et Compar√©e of the Coll√®ge de France, Paris. He began his teaching career in 1968 as an assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen's Institute for Biological Chemistry, where he became an associate professor in 1972, and served as the Head of the Institute from 1978-1980. Hoffmeyer was the recipient of the Poul Henningsen Award in 1985,Biography in danish the 1991 Mouton d‚ÄôOr Award, and named a Thomas Sebeok Fellow by the Semiotic Society of America on the occasion of its 25th annual meeting in 2000. Hoffmeyer was awarded a doctorate in philosophy (Dr. Phil.) at Aarhus University in 2005, and since 2007 has served as President of the International Society for Biosemiotic Studies. Since 2009, Hoffmeyer was a professor emeritus at the University of Copenhagen. Life and work Jesper Hoffmeyer's research interests changed considerably through the years. An early engagement in the social and political consequences of his own discipline, biochemistry, led him in the 1970s to take up studies of the technological, ecological and historical dimensions of science. The results of these investigations can be found in his 1982 book Samfundets naturhistorie (The Natural History of Society). At the same time, Hoffmeyer also embarked upon a parallel track of inquiry, based on a growing awareness that the reductionist tendencies of modern biology and science systematically legitimized and guided the technological horizon towards developments that were inherently damaging to natural systems, including that of human health. This inquiry led him towards questions of theoretical biology and philosophy. Eventually these two research tracks ran together, when, in a collaboration with Claus Emmeche, he initiated an analysis of the concepts of information in both its bio-ontological dimension, as well as in its applied contexts dealing with biological (e.g. genetic) and cultural information, and the then-upcoming 'smart' information and biotechnologies.\\"Joining Life Science with Sign Science: Jesper Hoffmeyer\\" in The Evolutionary History of Biosemiotics. Donald Favareau. Introduction to Biosemiotics: The New Biological Synthesis. Marcello Barbieri, ed. pp. 37-41.] Hoffmeyer traced much of the development of his thinking during this period to the semiotic traditions of the late 1980s, as well as to such scientific systems theorists as Gregory Bateson, Michael Polanyi, Anthony Wilden, Howard H. Pattee and Peder Voetmann Christiansen. Eventually making the acquaintance of Thomas Sebeok in the United States, Thure von Uexk√ºll in Germany and Kalevi Kull in Estonia, by the beginning of the 1990s, Hoffmeyer had formulated a new programme for a scientific biology that would define life as a signbased phenomenon. Hoffmeyer's first comprehensive essay outlining this of biosemiotics and its implication for a non-dualist understanding of the embodied self was his Signs of Meaning in the Universe (in Danish, En snegl p√• vejen, 1993).Reading Hoffmeyer. Rethinking Biology, Edited by Claus Emmeche, Kalevi Kull and Frederik Stjernfelt, University of Tartu Press. 2002. Beginning in 2001, when the yearly annual international ‚ÄòGatherings in Biosemiotics‚Äô conferences began, Hoffmeyer became a central figure in establishing biosemiotics as a scientific cross- disciplinary field, assembling scientists and humanities scholars to jointly investigate how a semiotic analysis can inform current biological thinking, and how the findings of biology provide general semiotics with a firmer ground for the naturalization of 'meaning'.‚ÄúJesper Hoffmeyer.‚Äù The Routledge Companion to Semiotics. Paul Cobley, ed. (2009) pp. 239-240. In 2005, Hoffmeyer was conferred with a Danish doctoral degree for his treatise Biosemiotics: An Examination into the Signs of Life and the Life of Signs. Translated into an English-language edition in 2008, this work examines the semiotics of living nature, from the origin of life with its self-organizing code-duality in evolution and development, to the complex endosemiosis of living bodies, to the ‚Äòsemiotic niches‚Äô in ecosystems, and the species- specific peculiarities of human semiosis, such as language.

At its time, it was one of the poorest and most dangerous areas in Colombia, known for rampant drug trafficking and inhabited by the poverty stricken. El Cartucho was widely considered to be a symbol of urban degradation. History Originally located on the 9th and 10th streets of Bogota between carreras 13 and 13A, the area expanded over the years to occupy most of the neighborhood of Santa In√©s. The name El Cartucho had been used for this area since the mid 20th century due to its proximity to an open air market dedicated to reclaiming materials such as bottles, cardboard, and construction material (collective called \\"cartucho\\" in Colombian Spanish). after the events of El Bogotazo, the neighborhood experienced a time of rapid decay during which much of its inhabitants moved to nearby neighborhoods. In their place, the area was populated by those displaced by drug trafficking related violence, often the city's poorest persons. The majority of the area's decay is attributed to the demolition of the market and the church of Santa In√©s on carrera 10th. In the decade of the 1980s, the neighborhood began to be gradually invaded by drug traffickers, the destitute, sex-workers, and criminals. This converted the area into the most dangerous neighborhood of the city. Murder, drug trafficking, mutilations, and other crimes became commonplace, aided by the absence of police in the neighborhood. By the 1990s, the area was widely considered to be irrecoverable. Urban legend states that in one point, El Cartucho got so bad, a crocodile was somehow brought in, and stored in a hollowed out basement in one of the homes that was turned into a makeshift enclosure, and named Pepe. Pepe was fed with human remains of those who passed away due to drug overdose, or those murdered in the area. During the late 1990s, during the government of Enrique Pe√±alosa, it was decided to reclaim the area, along with other violent neighborhoods in the city, and to demolish the entire neighborhood in order to be replaced with the Tercer Milenio Park. Despite the protesting of the decision, and the lack of plans for relocation of the poor inhabitants of the neighborhood, the plan moved ahead. The park was inaugurated in the year 2000. =Legacy= The name Cartucho has been generalized to refer to any zone of extreme urban decay, particularly those rife with crime and drug violence. Due to the destruction of El Cartucho, the illicit drug activities which were once conducted in the area have moved to adjacent neighborhoods, although in a reduced capacity. It is estimated that the adjacent area known as El Bronx is the source for up to 90% of the city's drugs. The neighborhood to the south of the park known as San Bernardo is also a location of drug trafficking.

At that time, the Soviet Union and Japan were the dominant nations in women's volleyball, and Buldakova and her team captured many titles.

Career In September 1991, she entered junior high school in Yantai, and in 1994 she entered Yantai Yizhong High School and graduated from high school in 1997. She was admitted to the Changchun Flight Academy of the People's Liberation Army Air Force and joined the army in August 1997. Wang Yaping is the seventh female military pilot in China. As a pilot of the Wuhan Air Force transport aircraft crew, she has participated in many major tasks such as combat readiness exercises, the Wenchuan Earthquake Relief, and the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games to eliminate clouds and reduce rain. After accumulating safe flights for 1600 hours, she was named Air Force Class II pilot. In May 2010 she officially became the second astronaut in China. At that time Wang was a captain in the People's Liberation Army Air Force. She was a candidate for the space mission Shenzhou 9 in 2012. However, Liu Yang was selected over her for the historic mission of the first Chinese female space traveller. Wang was a member of the backup crew for SZ-9. Wang became the second Chinese female astronaut as a member of the Shenzhou 10 spaceship crew, which orbited the Earth in June 2013, and of the Tiangong-1 orbiting space station with which it docked. She was known as the ‚ÄúGoddess II‚Äù. She was the first member of the crew announced, in April, while the remainder of the crew were announced in June. Wang Yaping was one of two women in space on the 50th anniversary of Vostok 6, the first spaceflight by a woman, Valentina Tereshkova. The other woman in space on 16 June 2013 was Karen Nyberg, an American astronaut aboard the International Space Station. While aboard Tiangong-1, Wang conducted scientific experiments and taught a physics lesson to Chinese students by live television broadcast.

Columbia Broadcasting System Inc., 441 U.S. 1 (1979), was an important antitrust case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States.  Background  The TV network CBS (also, at the time, owner of Columbia Records) filed an antitrust suit against licensing agencies alleging that the system by which these agencies received fees for the issuance of blanket licenses to perform copyrighted musical compositions amounted to illegal price fixing. The basic question in the case is \\"whether the issuance by ASCAP and BMI to CBS of blanket licenses to copyrighted musical compositions at fees negotiated by them is price fixing per se unlawful under the antitrust laws.\\" Judgment The Supreme Court held that blanket licenses issued by ASCAP and BMI did not necessarily constitute price fixing. The judgment, delivered by White J, was unanimous in holding that such practice should instead be examined under the rule of reason to determine if it is unlawful. Stevens J agreed with the majority, but would not have remanded the case to the lower courts for rehearing. He would have held that the blanket license were a breach of s1 of the Sherman Act using the rule of reason. Significance The case was part of the court's retreat from applying rigid per se rules in antitrust to a more permissive rule of reason. See also * US antitrust law * Westmoreland v.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of The Churches Conservation Trust. History The present church was built in 1868 on the site of an earlier church dating from the Norman era. The architect was Charles Buckeridge. The church was declared redundant on 11 May 1983, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust. It is still used occasionally for concerts or community events. Between May 2007 and September 2008 work was carried out on the spire at a cost of about ¬£700,000, with the result that the church bells were rung on 21 February 2009, the first time for some decades. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in Hornton sandstone with tiled roofs. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave with a north aisle and a south porch, a three-bay chancel with a north organ chamber, and a west tower with a spire. The architectural style of the church, other than the north arcade, is Gothic Revival, in the style of the early 14th century. Most of the fabric used was new, although a small amount of fabric from the earlier church was incorporated, including fragments from the 12th century. The tower is in three stages, with angle buttresses, and a stair turret at the southeast angle. The lowest stage has a west window of four lights, which was formerly the east window of the earlier church. In the middle stage is single-light window, and in the upper stage the bell openings have two lights. The tower is surmounted by a tall octagonal spire. The nave measures by . In its south wall is a porch and three windows, one with a single light, and the others with two lights. The north aisle is wide, and has three two-light windows. The chancel measures about by . Its east window has three lights. The other windows have two lights, two on the north side and three on the south. =Interior= The three-bay north arcade is in Norman style, carried on round pillars. In the north wall of the chancel is a recess containing a 13th-century stone coffin with a lid. The lid is carved in high relief with the effigy of a deacon with a tonsure. He is dressed in vestments, including a cassock, an alb, a dalmatic, a maniple, and a stole. It is thought that this is the coffin of Hugh (or Hugo), rector of the church, who died in about 1240. All the furniture of the church dates from the building of the present church, including the font, which is made of grey marble. In the sanctuary are an oak altar and choir stalls, a stone triple sedilia, and a reredos in grey Purbeck marble with a cross in its centre. In the church are memorials dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. The west window contains a few fragments of 15th-century glass. There is a ring of five bells that were cast by William Blews of Birmingham. Since the church was declared redundant, work has been carried out to improve their condition. The parish registers date from 1559. External features In the churchyard are six headstones and a chest tomb, each of which is designated as a Grade II listed building. The headstones consist of one dated 1687, another from the mid-late 17th century, a further one dated 1699, another dated 1681, one dated 1706, and another, this one dated 1719. The chest tomb dates from the middle of the 17th century.

Timeline On May 15, 2001, a CSX locomotive engineer was using Locomotive #8888 to move a string of freight cars from one track to another within Stanley Yard in Walbridge, Ohio, CSX's primary classification yard for Toledo. The string consisted of 47 freight cars, 22 of which were loaded. Two tank cars contained thousands of gallons of liquid phenol, a toxic ingredient of paints, glues, and dyes that is harmful when it is inhaled, ingested, or comes into contact with the skin. The engineer, a 35-year veteran (whose name has not been disclosed) with a clean disciplinary record, noticed a misaligned switch and concluded that his train, although moving slowly, would not be able to stop short of it. He decided to climb down from the train, correctly align the switch, and reboard the locomotive. Before leaving the cab, the engineer applied the locomotive's independent air brake. During mainline operation, he would also have applied the automatic air brake, setting the brakes in each of the train's cars. But, as is normal for intra- yard movements, the air brakes of the train were disconnected from the locomotive, and thus were not functional. Furthermore, applying the locomotive's brakes disabled the train's dead man's switch, which would otherwise have applied the train brakes and cut the engine power. The engineer also attempted to apply the locomotive's dynamic brake to slow the train to a crawl; dynamic brakes dissipate momentum (kinetic energy) by using the momentum of the train to drive the main generator, generating electricity, exactly like a regenerative braking system in a hybrid automobile, which slows the train. However, the engineer \\"inadvertently failed to complete the selection process\\", meaning that the train's engine was set to accelerate, not to brake. He then set the throttle for the traction motors at notch 8. If the dynamic brakes had been engaged as intended, this throttle setting would have used the motors against the momentum of the train, causing it to slow down. Instead the train began to accelerate. Therefore, the only functioning brake was the air brake on the locomotive, and this was not enough to counteract its engine power. The engineer climbed down from the cab, aligned the switch, and then attempted to reboard the accelerating locomotive. However he was unable to do so and was dragged about , receiving minor cuts and abrasions. There were no other injuries or deaths resulting from the incident. The train rolled out of the yard and began a journey south through northwest Ohio with no one at the controls. A portable derailer Attempts to derail the train using a portable derailer failed. Police also shot at an emergency fuel cutoff switch, which had no effect because the button must be pressed for several seconds before the engine would be starved of fuel and shut down. A northbound freight train, Q636-15, was directed onto a siding where the crew uncoupled its locomotive, #8392 (another EMD SD40-2), and waited for the runaway train to pass. #8392 had a crew of two: Jess Knowlton, an engineer with 31 years of service; and Terry L. Forson, a conductor with one year's experience. Together they chased the runaway train. An EMD GP40-2, CSX locomotive #6008, was prepared further down the line to couple to the front of the runaway to slow it further, if necessary. Knowlton and Forson successfully coupled onto the rear car, and slowed the train by applying the dynamic brakes on the chase locomotive. Once the runaway had slowed to , CSX trainmaster Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train, climbed aboard, and shut down the engine. The train was stopped just southeast of Kenton before reaching the GP40-2. All the brake shoes on #8888 had been destroyed by the heat from being applied throughout the runaway trip. Preservation attempts Several railway museums had tried to buy #8888, but CSX officials replied that they did not feel the locomotive was worthy of preservation and that it would be rebuilt as part of the SD40-3 rebuild program in late 2014 and early 2015. The locomotive now operates as CSX SD40-3 #4389. In film The incident inspired the 2010 movie Unstoppable.

Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585 (1985), was a United States Supreme Court case that decided whether a dominant firm's unilateral refusal to deal with a competitor could establish a monopolization claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.. The unanimous Supreme Court agreed with the 10th Circuit that terminating a pro-consumer joint venture without a legitimate business justification could constitute illegal monopolization.472 U.S. at 605‚Äì09 However, its decision created an exception to the general rule that firms can decide with whom to do business absent collusion, sparking significant controversy about the appropriate scope of this exception.., doi:10.15779/Z38KX2Z., doi:10.3386/w8105. In a subsequent case, Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, stated that Aspen Skiing is \\"at or near the outer boundary of ¬ß 2 liability.\\". Although its holding has been narrowed, this case's relevance remains contested, especially in the context of refusals to license intellectual property... Facts Aspen Highlands and Aspen Skiing Co. were rival ski resorts in Aspen, Colorado. Throughout his ownership, Aspen Highlands founder Whip Jones remained at odds with Aspen Skiing Company, which owned and operated the three other Aspen ski areas: Aspen Mountain (Ajax), Buttermilk and Snowmass. In every season, but one, from 1962 to 1977, Highlands and Ski Co. collaborated to offer a 6-day, All-Aspen ticket. Revenues from All-Aspen ticket sales were divided according to which hills skiers used.472 U.S. 585 at 591. Multi-area tickets became popular with consumers and by 1977 made up over one third of the market. Despite more than a decade of cooperation, Ski Co. management grew discontent with the All-Aspen ticket. Complaining that monitoring ticket-holders‚Äô use was cumbersome and inaccurate and that the All-Aspen ticket attracted customers who would otherwise buy Ski Co.‚Äôs 3-area, 6-day ticket, Ski Co. management recommended abandoning the All-Aspen ticket for the 1978-79 season.472 U.S. 585 at 592. Accordingly, the Ski Co. board offered Highlands a fixed percentage of the revenue significantly below Highland‚Äôs usual rate to continue the All-Aspen ticket for the 1978-79 season. As one board member suggested, it was an offer Highlands ‚Äúcould not accept‚Äù and the All-Aspen ticket vanished. Although Highlands sought other ways to offer multi-area passes to compete with Ski Co., Ski Co. successfully thwarted its efforts. Ski Co. refused to sell Highlands any lift tickets, even at retail value.472 U.S. at 593. It also refused to accept vouchers backed by local banks for the full cash-value of retail price lift tickets.472 U.S. at 594. Eventually, Highlands replaced vouchers with American Express Traveler's Checks or money orders. While Ski Co. accepted these, the product was inconvenient compared to the All-Aspen ticket and Highland's share of the Aspen downhill skiing market sank from 20.5% in the 1976-77 season to only 11% in the 1980-81 season.472 U.S. at 594-95. In 1979, Highlands filed a complaint against Ski Co. alleging illegal monopolization in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.472 U.S. at 595.  Procedural History  A jury in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado found that Ski Co. maintained its monopoly through anticompetitive means in violation of the Sherman Act. The District Court awarded Highlands $7,500,000 in treble damages, costs, attorneys' fees and issued a temporary injunction requiring revival of the All-Aspen ticket.472 U.S. at 598. Ski Co. appealed the decision, arguing that its refusal to cooperate with a competitor could not constitute illegal monopolization as a matter of law. However, the 10th Circuit affirmed the jury verdict, finding that Ski Co.‚Äôs refusal to cooperate could constitute illegal monopolization applying either of the two available tests: (1) the anticompetitive effect and intent test and (2) the essential facilities doctrine.Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 738 F.2d at 1520.472 U.S. at 599. The Supreme Court granted cert and affirmed the 10th Circuit‚Äôs decision based on anticompetitive intent, without analyzing the essential facilities doctrine.472 U.S. at 600. Judgment The Supreme Court held that Ski Co.'s refusal to deal with Highlands, despite the historical success of their joint-venture, could constitute illegal monopolization because it deprived consumers of a superior All-Aspen ticket option,472 U.S. at 605-607. injured Highlands' ability to offer competitive multi-area tickets,472 U.S. at 607-08. and, \\"perhaps most significant,\\" it lacked any efficiency justification.472 U.S. at 608-611. As the Court recognized in Lorain Journal, a firm's right to choose with whom to do business, or not, is important, but not \\"unqualified.‚Äù472 U.S. at 601 (citing ). The court assessed and rejected all of Ski Co.'s proffered justifications for its refusals to deal. Ski Co. attempted to justify its termination of the All-Aspen ticket by suggesting that use monitoring was too inaccurate, but the Court pointed out Ski Co. already monitored usage on its own hills.472 U.S. at 608-09. Ski Co. further argued that it refused to accept Highland's ‚ÄúAdventure-Pack‚Äù coupons, even though they were redeemable for cash at local banks, because were cumbersome to process.472 U.S. at 609. However, the Court upheld factual findings that these vouchers were no more difficult to process than credit cards. Finally, Ski Co. argued that it ended its relationship with Highlands in order to distance itself from what, Ski Co. argued, were inferior slopes.472 U.S. at 609-610. The Court rejected this argument as implausible for two reasons: First, consumers could differentiate and assess quality on their own by choosing where to ski; Second, Ski Co. associated itself with \\"inferior products in other markets.\\"472 U.S. at 610. Rejecting all proffered justifications, the Court found that Ski Co. sacrificed short-term profits from selling Highlands lift tickets at retail prices in the hope of long-term anticompetitive gains from injuring their rival. This conduct could support a monopolization claim.  Criticism  Aspen Skiing was criticized for its handing of economic issues and its controversial injunction requiring cooperation. = Inadequate Analysis of Exclusionary Effects = In its caution to avoid imposing inappropriate duties to deal, the Court focused significant attention on the history of successful joint-ventures to illustrate that such conduct was possible and beneficial.472 U.S. at 603-607.Jacobs, supra, at 65.Carlton, supra, at 677. As critics point out, however, this analysis alone does not support an antitrust violation.Herbert Hovenkamp, The Monopolization Offense, 61 Ohio St. L.J. 1035, 1044 (2000) If a joint-venture produces efficiencies, both parties should be able to reach an agreement without judicial intervention. Therefore, the discontinuation a joint-venture should not be suspect except in very narrow circumstances where one rival has the ability to exclude the other from the market. In this case, Ski Co. did not explicitly exclude Highlands since it did not prohibit its ski customers from also purchasing passes from Highlands. Still, Ski Co. might have functionally excluded Highlands.Carlton, supra, at 678. With three of the four Aspen mountains, Ski Co. enjoyed significant economies of scale. It also employed a non-linear pricing structure, offering significantly lower rates for multi-day passes over single-day passes. Customers choosing Ski Co.'s multi-area, multi-day passes may choose not to purchase Highlands passes since they already sunk the cost of the Ski Co. ticket.472 U.S. at 607 (\\"Even for the affluent, this was an irritating situation because it left the skier the option of either wasting 1 day of the 6-day, 3-area pass or obtaining a refund which could take all morning and entailed the forfeit of the 6-day discount.\\") While this exclusion could raise antitrust concerns, the Court did not address the central issues: whether there were economies of scale, whether there were sufficient day-pass skiers to avoid harm from exclusion in the multi- area/multi-day pass market, whether the non-linear pricing structure lead to exclusion. Despite its emphasis on prior dealing, the Court did not wholly disregard exclusion. When discussing consumer preferences, the Court referenced a survey in the record indicating that over half of respondents \\"wanted to ski Highlands, but would not\\" and about 40% responded that \\"they would not be skiing at the mountain of their choice because their ticket could not permit it.\\"472 U.S. at 606-07. The Court, quoting the 10th Circuit decision, also \\"noted that by refusing to cooperate with Highlands, Ski Co. became the only business in Aspen that could offer a multi-day multi-mountain skiing experience.\\"472 U.S. at 599 (internal quotations omitted). While neither the Supreme Court nor the 10th Circuit analyzed how exclusion from the multi-day/multi-area sub-market impacted the downhill skiing market as a whole, these facts may be relevant to finding the exclusion necessary for a monopolization claim. = Improper Market Definition = Neither the 10th Circuit nor the Supreme Court engaged in significant analysis of the relevant market. This, however, was not an oversight. The 10th Circuit refused to hear Ski Co.'s appeal of the relevant market instruction because they failed to properly object during the trial.Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 738 F.2d at 1515. Ski Co. argued that the relevant market should be decided by the judge as a matter of law (applying the Small, but Significant and Non-Transitory Increase in Price or SSNIP test), not the jury.Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 738 F.2d at 1513‚Äì16., doi:10.1093/joclec/nhq012. The trial court judge disagreed, reinforcing the idea that market definition is generally a question of fact. Ski Co. failed to object to the jury instruction's emphasis on relevant submarkets. Therefore, the appeals courts adopted the jury findings that \\" the relevant product submarket was downhill skiing services in the Aspen area, including multi-area and multi-day lift tickets\\" and \\"the relevant geographic submarket was the Aspen area.\\"Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 738 F.2d at 1513. Criticism of this conclusion falls on the jury, not the judges. While the jury apparently accepted the analysis of the Plaintiff's marketing expert, who emphasized that Highlands and Ski Co. competed over skiers who already decided to come to Aspen,Macher and Mayo, supra, at 9. Ski Co. argued that this limited geographic market definition overlooked the fact that most Aspen skiers came from outside Colorado, suggesting that Aspen resorts actually competed with skiing destinations throughout North America.Jacobs, supra, at 64.Macher and Mayo, supra, at 10-13. A wider geographic market could mean Ski Co. lacked the requisite monopoly power for a conviction under Section 2. While the court alludes to the difference between multi-area/multi- day packages and single-day passes, it does not question the jury's finding. = Inappropriate Injunctive Relief = The injunction requiring cooperation to offer an All-Aspen ticket was widely criticized. First, since cooperation failed in the market, an injunction to cooperate forces the court to play the role of regulator, overseeing the price-setting and other complex terms of the contract..Verizon Commc'ns Inc., 540 U.S. at 408. Second, requiring cooperation can make it easier for rivals to illegally collude in markets outside the joint-venture. In fact, in 1975, when Highlands and Ski Co. were cooperating to offer the All-Aspen ticket, the Colorado Attorney General sued both of them for alleged price-fixing.472 U.S. 585, 591 n.9 The case settled with a consent decree allowing the All-Aspen ticket to continue.  Subsequent Case Law  As the Supreme Court stated in Verizon Communications v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, Aspen is \\"[t]he leading case imposing ¬ß 2 liability for refusal to deal with competitors.\\"Verizon Commc'ns Inc., 540 U.S. at 399. Aspen \\"is at or near the outer boundary of ¬ß 2 liability\\" and represents a \\"limited exception\\" to a firm's right to choose with whom to do business that applies when a monopolist is willing to \\"forsake short-term profits to achieve an anticompetitive end.\\" Subsequent cases have applied and refined Aspen's holding: *Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech.

Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398 (2004) (Distinguishing Aspen, the Court found no antitrust liability for a monopolist's unilateral refusal to cooperate with a rival when there was no history of prior cooperation because, unlike the termination of a successful joint-venture, refusal to enter a cooperative agreement does not create a presumption that the monopolist sacrificed short-term profits for future anticompetitive gain)See also . *Pacific Bell Telephone Co. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U.S. 438 (2009) (finding, absent a duty to deal as existed in Aspen, a monopolist's practice of charging rivals high wholesale prices, while charging direct consumers low retail prices, known as \\"price- squeezing,\\" is not cognizable under the Sherman Act) References External links * Category:United States antitrust case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court Category:1985 in United States case law Category:Aspen Skiing Company Category:Legal history of Colorado ","title":"Aspen Skiing Co. v.

In 1953 Hoffman was one of the first surfers to brave the outer reefs of the Oahu's North Shore where he was a big wave surfing pioneer. Hoffman first worked as an abalone fisherman while he was not surfing. In the late 1950s Hoffman helped run the family textile business Hoffman California Fabrics along with his brother Walter. The company had been started in 1924 by their father Rube Hoffman, originally selling woolen flannel fabrics. Hoffman oversaw the company's business that sold directly to retail stores. He was also involved researching the production processes, and new designs. Hoffman Fabrics was integral in creating and manufacturing surf apparel from the late 1950s onward. In the 1980s the aloha shirt worn by Tom Selleck in the TV series Magnum, P.I. was made from Hoffman fabric. It is now in the Smithsonian Institution. \\"When the surf was really big, he'd take off and go surfing,\\" said his brother. Hoffman worked with surfboard designers such as Mickey Munoz, Hobie Alter and Bob Simmons to improve the design of surf boards. Hoffman died at Mission Viejo, California from pulmonary fibrosis complications. He was survived by his partner Suzy, brother Walter, daughter Dana, and son Marty. His brother's daughter Joyce Hoffman was a champion surfer, and great-grandson Greyson Fletcher a professional skateboarder.

From 2004 to 2007, GBI implemented over 40 technical assistance projects and investments impacting the lives of over 3.4 million direct and indirect beneficiaries at the bottom of the socioeconomic pyramid. In 2008, the GBI department was transformed into an independent organization called the Grassroots Business Fund (GBF). Leadership Harold Rosen is Executive Director of the Grassroots Business Fund. Harold spent 30 years managing IFC's emerging markets investments and leading IFC into new geographic areas and sectors, such as microfinance, technical assistance and SMEs. He founded the World Bank's group SME department, and then spun this off into Grassroots Business Fund, an independent organization funded by IFC and a number of others. Portfolio GBF makes equity, quasi-equity, and debt investments. Quasi-equity investments are debt instruments with embedded equity features, such as convertible loans, royalty-based loans, and warrants. GBF targets investments between $750,000 to $2,500,000 and has an average investment horizon of 5 to 7 years. GBF can also provide short-term working capital loans to export-oriented businesses between $40,000 and $150,000 through a separate facility (SME Export Facility). To date, GBF has invested $7 million invested in 26 businesses across 10 countries. Included in these was Novica in 2009. Novica enables artisans to sell their goods worldwide. Impact During 2009, Keystone supported GBF to make a significant investment in its own evaluation systems, captured in what they believe is a 'best in class' framework called Impact Planning, Assessment and Learning (iPAL) framework. GBF's innovative monitoring and evaluation framework called, Impact Planning, Assessment, and Learning (iPAL), which allows GBF and its clients to better respond to results and experiences of their beneficiaries. iPAL effectively measures, analyzes and communicates the poverty alleviation impact of its clients, not only for internal purposes, but more importantly to guide and support its clients‚Äô social mission. In doing so, GBF focuses on capturing impact data from its clients rather than just narrative reports. GBF's initial focus is determining metrics that allow its clients to set and manage objectives, improve impacts, and strengthen management systems. GBF integrates its iPAL framework throughout the investment life cycle and ensures that iPAL is integrated into its clients‚Äô business processes. GBF tailors iPAL to each GBO, which includes basic reporting on activities and outputs, a survey-based review of beneficiary impacts, a social return on investment calculation, and client feedback.http://www.sais- jhu.edu/bin/u/f/GBF_description2010.pdf Awards The Group of 20 and Ashoka's Changemakers, with support from the Rockefeller Foundation, have launched an online competition to find the best models worldwide for public- private partnerships that catalyze finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The G-20 SME Finance Challenge, the first ever competition launched by the G-20, is a unique financial inclusion effort aimed at giving small entrepreneurs a chance to grow their businesses. GBF was named one of 14 winners out of over 350 submitted proposals. The winners receive funding and GBF's executive director, Harold Rosen, accepted an invitation to the November 2010 G-20 Summit in South Korea. For this event, he will join the leaders from around the world to discuss SME's role in poverty alleviation, including GBF's innovate solutions to some of the most challenging problems facing the world today.

At the time the largest cemetery in the world, Brookwood Cemetery was designed to be large enough to accommodate all the deaths in London for centuries to come, and the LNC hoped to gain a monopoly on London's burial industry. The cemetery had intentionally been built far enough from London so as never to be affected by urban growth and was dependent on the recently invented railway to connect it to the city. The railway mostly ran along the existing tracks of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) but had its own branches from the main line at both London and Brookwood. Trains carried coffins and passengers from a dedicated station in Waterloo, London, onto the LSWR tracks. On reaching the cemetery, the trains reversed down a dedicated branch line to two stations in the cemetery, one for the burial of Anglicans and one for Nonconformists (non-Anglicans) or those who did not want a Church of England funeral. The station waiting rooms and the compartments of the train, both for living and for dead passengers, were partitioned by both religion and class to prevent both mourners and cadavers from different social backgrounds from mixing. As well as the regular funeral traffic, the London Necropolis Railway was used to transport large numbers of exhumed bodies during the mass removal of a number of London graveyards to Brookwood. The company failed to gain a monopoly of the burial industry, and the scheme was not as successful as its promoters had hoped. While they had planned to carry between 10,000 and 50,000 bodies per year, in 1941 after 87 years of operation, only slightly over 200,000 burials had been conducted in Brookwood Cemetery, equalling roughly 2,300 bodies per year. On the night of 16‚Äì17 April 1941, the London terminus was badly damaged in an air raid and rendered unusable. Although the LNC continued to operate occasional funeral services from Waterloo station to Brookwood railway station immediately north of the cemetery, the London Necropolis Railway was never used again. Soon after the end of the Second World War the surviving parts of the London station were sold as office space, and the rail tracks in the cemetery were removed. The part of the London building which housed the LNC's offices survives today. The two stations in the cemetery remained open as refreshment kiosks for some years afterwards but were subsequently demolished. The site of the northern station, serving the Nonconformist cemetery, is now heavily overgrown. The site of the southern, Anglican, station is now the location of a Russian Orthodox monastery and a shrine to King Edward the Martyr, which incorporate the surviving station platform and the former station chapels.  London burial crisis  London's dead had traditionally been buried in and around local churches, and with a limited amount of space for burials, the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials. In the first half of the 19th century the population of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300 acres (0.5 sq mi; 1.2 km2), spread across around 200 small sites. Graveyards became very congested. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid. Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory (the belief that airborne particles were the primary factor in the spread of contagious disease), and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one. In 1848‚Äì49 a cholera epidemic killed 14,601 people in London and overwhelmed the burial system completely. Bodies were left stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves were exhumed to make way for new burials. = Proposed solutions = alt=Map of a city surrounded by small cemeteries, and two larger proposed cemeteries slightly further out. A railway line runs from the city to a single large cemetery to the southwest, a long way further out. In the wake of public concerns following the cholera epidemics and the findings of the Royal Commission, the Act to Amend the Laws Concerning the Burial of the Dead in the Metropolis (Burials Act) was passed in 1851. Under the Burials Act, new burials were prohibited in what were then the built-up areas of London. Seven large cemeteries had recently opened a short distance from the centre of London or were in the process of opening, and temporarily became London's main burial grounds. The government sought a means to prevent the constantly increasing number of deaths in London from overwhelming the new cemeteries in the same manner in which it had overwhelmed the traditional burial grounds. Edwin Chadwick proposed the closure of all existing burial grounds in the vicinity of London other than the privately owned Kensal Green Cemetery northwest of the city, which was to be nationalised and greatly enlarged to provide a single burial ground for west London. A large tract of land on the Thames around southeast of London in Abbey Wood was to become a single burial ground for east London. The Treasury was sceptical that Chadwick's scheme would ever be financially viable, and it was widely unpopular. Although the Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 authorised the scheme, it was abandoned in 1852.  London Necropolis Company  An alternative proposal was drawn up by Sir Richard Broun and Richard Sprye, who planned to use the emerging technology of mechanised transport to resolve the crisis. The scheme entailed buying a single very large tract of land around from London in Brookwood near Woking, Surrey, to be called Brookwood Cemetery or the London Necropolis. At this distance, the land would be far beyond the maximum projected size of the city's growth. The London and South Western Railway (LSWR)‚Äîwhich had connected London to Woking in 1838‚Äîwould enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply. Broun envisaged dedicated coffin trains, each carrying 50‚Äì60 bodies, travelling from London to the new Necropolis in the early morning or late at night, and the coffins being stored on the cemetery site until the time of the funeral. Mourners would then be carried to the appropriate part of the cemetery by a dedicated passenger train during the day. Broun calculated that a site would accommodate a total of 5,830,500 individual graves in a single layer. If the practice of only burying a single family in each grave were abandoned and the traditional practice for pauper burials of ten burials per grave were adopted, the site was capable of accommodating 28,500,000 bodies. Assuming 50,000 deaths per year and presuming that families would often choose to share a grave, Broun calculated that even with the prohibition of mass graves it would take over 350 years to fill a single layer. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that the speed of the railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse- drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site. Shareholders in the LSWR were concerned at the impact the cemetery scheme would have on the normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the cemetary's promoters conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives. On 30 June 1852 the promoters of the Brookwood scheme were given Parliamentary consent to proceed, and the London Necropolis and National Mausoleum Company (LNC) was formed. The former Woking Common near Brookwood, owned by the Earl of Onslow, was chosen as the site for the new cemetery. To prevent the LSWR from exploiting its monopoly on access to the cemetery, the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners to the cemetery in perpetuity and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic, but did not specify detail of how the funeral trains were to operate. Broun's scheme had envisaged the cemetery running along both sides of the LSWR main line and divided by religion, with separate private railway halts on the main line, each incorporating a chapel, to serve each religion's section. The new consulting engineer to the company, William Cubitt, rejected this idea and recommended a single site to the south of the railway line, served by a private branch line through the cemetery. The company also considered Broun's plan for dedicated coffin trains unrealistic, arguing that relatives would not want the coffins to be shipped separately. Internal disputes within the LNC led to Broun and Sprye losing control of the scheme, and later delays and allegations of mismanagement caused further changes to the scheme's management. In September 1853 under a new board of trustees work began on the scheme. A site for the London rail terminus was identified and leased, and a tract of land stretching from Woking to Brookwood was purchased from Lord Onslow. The westernmost , at the Brookwood end, were designated the initial cemetery site, and a branch railway line was built from the main line into this section. On 7 November 1854 the new cemetery opened and the southern Anglican section was consecrated by Charles Sumner, Bishop of Winchester. At the time it was the largest cemetery in the world. On 13 November the first scheduled train left the new London Necropolis railway station for the cemetery, and the first burial (that of the stillborn twins of a Mr and Mrs Hore of Ewer Street, Borough) took place.  Cemetery railway branch  alt=Irregularly shaped plot of land, with a railway line and station as the top boundary. A road marked \\"Cemetery Pales\\" bisects the plot of land into sections marked \\"Nonconformist\\" and \\"Anglican\\". A branch from the railway line runs through these two sections, with a station roughly in the centre of each. William Cubitt decided that the terrain of the initial site was best suited to a railway branch at the west side. Work began on the earthworks and rails in early September 1854. The single-track branch was ready for the opening two months later, at a construction cost of ¬£1419 17s 6d (about ¬£ in terms of consumer spending power). The junction with the LSWR, known as Necropolis Junction, was west-facing, meaning that trains to and from London were obliged to reverse in and out of the branch. No run-around loop was provided, but a single crossover allowed trains from the branch to reverse onto the northern (London-bound) track of the LSWR. The new branch ran east downhill from Necropolis Junction. After passing through white gates marking the cemetary boundary, it curved south into the northern, Nonconformist section, the site of North station (). The line straightened and ran southeast over a level crossing across Cemetery Pales, the road dividing the northern and southern halves of the initial cemetery site. After crossing Cemetery Pales the branch turned east and ran through the southern, Anglican, section, terminating at South station () near the road from Bagshot to Guildford (today the A322) which marked the eastern boundary of the site. Along with the major roads and paths in the cemetery, the entire branch was lined with giant sequoia trees, the first significant planting of these trees (only introduced to Europe in 1853) in Britain. Aside from a short siding just south of Cemetery Pales, built in 1904‚Äì05 to serve the LNC's new masonry workshop, the layout of the branch remained unchanged throughout its operation. In 1914 a brick water tower was added near the masonry works siding, to allow the LNC's locomotives to refill their tanks before returning to London and thus avoid the need to interrupt their journey to refill at Woking. The poor quality gravel soil, which had been the initial reason for the site's cheapness and its selection as the site for the cemetery, was poorly suited as a railway trackbed. The LNC's rails, and in particular its sleepers, deteriorated rapidly and needed constantly to be replaced. In the early years of operation, locomotives hauling the trains from Waterloo would not travel down the branch into the cemetery, as it would leave them at the wrong end of the train for the return journey. Instead, the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction, and the carriages would be uncoupled from the locoomotive. A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping branch line to the two cemetery stations. While the train was on the branch line the locomotive would be repositioned to be at the front of the train once the horses drew it back out of the branch onto the main line. In 1864 Brookwood (Necropolis) railway station on the LSWR opened, immediately east of Necropolis Junction. When the station was built a run-around loop was added at Necropolis Junction, allowing locomotives to reposition themselves from the front to the rear of the train. From then on, on arrival at Necropolis Junction from London the locomotive would push the train into the cemetery from the rear, under the close supervision of LNC staff. This left the locomotive positioned to pull the train out, after which it would use the run-around loop to move to the other end of the train and pull it back to London. Between 1898 and 1904 the LSWR line through Brookwood was increased from two to four tracks; a thin slice of the northernmost part of the cemetery was ceded to the LSWR to allow the widening of the line. Brookwood station was rebuilt, and a new junction to the west of the station allowed trains to pass between the cemetery branch and all four of the LSWR lines.  Operations  The London Necropolis Company offered three classes of funerals, which also determined the type of railway ticket sold to mourners and the deceased. A first class funeral allowed the person buying the funeral to select the grave site of their choice anywhere in the cemetery; at the time of opening prices began at ¬£2 10s (about ¬£ in terms) for a basic plot with no special coffin specifications. It was expected by the LNC that those using first class graves would erect a permanent memorial of some kind in due course following the funeral. Second class funerals cost ¬£1 (about ¬£ in terms) and allowed some control over the burial location. The right to erect a permanent memorial cost an additional 10 shillings (about ¬£ in terms); if a permanent memorial was not erected the LNC reserved the right to re-use the grave in future. Third class funerals were reserved for pauper funerals; those buried at parish expense in the section designated for that parish. Although the LNC was forbidden from using mass graves (other than the burial of next of kin in the same grave) and thus even the lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for the deceased, third class funerals were not granted the right to erect a permanent memorial on the site. (The families of those buried could pay afterwards to upgrade a third-class grave to a higher class if they later wanted to erect a memorial, but this practice was rare.) At the time the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with separate Anglican and Nonconformist sections and separate first, second and third class compartments within each. This separation applied to both living and dead passengers. This was to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment, rather than to provide different levels of facilities for different types of mourner; the compartments intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors. At 11.35 am (11.20 am on Sundays) the train would leave London for Brookwood, arriving at Necropolis Junction at 12.25 pm (12.20 pm on Sundays). The LNC's trains were capable of transporting large numbers of mourners when required; the funeral of businessman Sir Nowroji Saklatwala on 25 July 1938 saw 155 mourners travelling first class on a dedicated LNC train. For extremely large funerals such as those of major public figures, the LSWR would provide additional trains from Waterloo to Brookwood station on the main line to meet the demand. Charles Bradlaugh, Member of Parliament for Northampton, was a vocal advocate of Indian self-government and a popular figure among the Indian community in London, many of whom attended his funeral on 3 February 1891. Over 5,000 mourners were carried on three long special LSWR trains, one of which was 17 carriages long. The mourners included the 21-year-old Mohandas Gandhi, who recollected witnessing a loud argument between \\"a champion atheist\\" and a clergyman at North station while waiting for the return train. The return trains to London generally left South station at 2.15 pm and Necropolis Junction at 2.30 pm; the return journey initially took around an hour owing to the need to stop to refill the locomotive with water, but following the construction of the water tower in the cemetery this fell to around 40 minutes. An 1854 agreement between the LNC and LSWR gave consent for the LNC to operate two or three funeral trains each day if demand warranted it, but traffic levels never rose to a sufficient level to activate this clause. The train only ran if there was a coffin or passengers at the London terminus waiting to use it, and both the journey from London to Brookwood and the later return would be cancelled if nobody was due to leave London that morning. It would not run if there was only a single third or second class coffin to be carried, and in these cases the coffin and funeral party would be held until the next service. Generally the trains ran direct from London to the cemetery, other than occasional stops to take on water. Between 1890 and 1910 the trains also sometimes stopped at Vauxhall and Clapham Junction for the benefit of mourners from south west London who did not want to travel via Waterloo, but these intermediate stops were discontinued and never reinstated. After 1 October 1900 the Sunday trains were discontinued, and from 1902 the daily train service was ended and trains ran only as required. = Fares = alt=Railway ticket labelled \\"Southern Railways London Necropolis Coffin Ticket, Waterloo to Brookwood, Third Class The Act of Parliament establishing the LNC had specified maximum ticket prices for the railway, and traffic never rose to the level at which it would have been justified for either the LNC or the LSWR to undertake costly and time- consuming lobbying for a change in the legislation. As a consequence, despite the effects of inflation, competition and variable costs the fares of the London Necropolis Railway never changed throughout the first 85 of its 87 years of operation. Live passengers were charged 6s in first class, 3s 6d in second class and 2s in third class (in 1854 worth about ¬£, ¬£ and ¬£ respectively in consumer terms) for a return ticket, while dead passengers were charged ¬£1 in first class, 5s in second class and 2s 6d in third class (in 1854 worth about ¬£, ¬£ and ¬£ respectively in consumer terms) for a one-way ticket. As the railway was intended only to be used by Londoners visiting the cemetery or attending funerals, the only tickets ever issued to living passengers were returns from London. In 1918 the LSWR (which provided the LNC's passenger carriages) abandoned second class services and the LNC as a consequence discontinued the sale of second class fares to living passengers, but continued to separate coffin tickets into first, second and third class dependent on the type of funeral booked. Intentionally set at a low level at the time the cemetery and railway opened, in later years the fixed fares offered a very substantial saving over main line tickets to Brookwood (in 1902 the 4s LSWR third class fare to Brookwood was twice the cost of the LNC's equivalent). Additional LNC traffic was generated by golfers disguised as mourners travelling to the golf course which had been built on those parts of the land bought by the LNC in 1852 which had not yet been incorporated into the cemetery. The fixed fares prompted complaints from other London funeral firms after the opening of Woking Crematorium in 1885, as rival undertakers were not given access to the LNC's cheap trains and had to pay the LSWR's cargo rate (24 shillings in 1885) to ship a coffin to Brookwood or Woking stations for transfer to the crematorium. In its last two years of operation, wartime rises in costs made the fixed fare structure untenable, and between July 1939 and January 1941 there were five slight adjustments to the fares. The live passenger rates rose to 7s 5d in first class and 2s 6d in third class, with equivalent changes to the fares for coffins. These fares remained far cheaper than the equivalent fares from Waterloo to Brookwood for both living and dead passengers on the Southern Railway (SR), which had absorbed the LSWR in the 1923 restructuring of Britain's railways. The fare structure of January 1941 remained in use following the April 1941 suspension of London Necropolis Railway services, for the occasional funerals conducted by the LNC using the SR's platforms at Waterloo station, but the SR only allowed mourners attending funerals to use these cheap fares and not those visiting the cemetery. = Relocation of London burial grounds = As well as taking over new burials from London's now-closed burial grounds, the LNC also envisaged the physical relocation of the existing burial grounds to their Necropolis, to provide a final solution to the problems caused by burials in built-up areas. The massive London civil engineering projects of the mid-19th century‚Äîthe railways, the sewer system and from the 1860s the precursors to the London Underground‚Äîoften necessitated the demolition of existing churchyards. The first major relocation took place in 1862, when the construction of Charing Cross railway station and the railway lines into it necessitated the demolition of the burial ground of Cure's College in Southwark. Around of earth was displaced, uncovering at least 7,950 bodies. These were packed into 220 large containers, each containing 26 adults plus children, and shipped on the London Necropolis Railway to Brookwood for reburial, along with at least some of the existing headstones from the cemetery, at a cost of around 3 shillings per body. At least 21 London burial grounds were relocated to Brookwood via the railway, along with numerous others relocated by road following the railway's closure. = Brookwood American Cemetery and Memorial = alt=White building behind rows of identical white gravestones In 1929 a section of the LNC's land at Brookwood was set aside as Brookwood American Cemetery and Memorial, the sole burial ground in Britain for US military casualties of the First World War. As most US casualties had occurred in continental Europe and been buried there, the number interred at Brookwood was small, with a total of 468 servicemen buried in the cemetery. After the entry of the United States into the Second World War the American cemetery was enlarged, with burials of US servicemen beginning in April 1942. With large numbers of American personnel based in the west of England, a dedicated rail service for the transport of bodies operated from Devonport to Brookwood. By August 1944 over 3,600 bodies had been buried in the American Military Cemetery. At this time burials were discontinued, and US casualties were from then on buried at Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial. On the authority of Thomas B. Larkin, Quartermaster General of the United States Army, the US servicemen buried at Brookwood during the Second World War were exhumed in January‚ÄìMay 1948. Those whose next of kin requested it were shipped to the United States for reburial, and the remaining bodies were transferred to the new cemetery outside Cambridge. (Brookwood American Cemetery had also been the burial site for those US servicemen executed while serving in the United Kingdom, whose bodies had been carried to Brookwood by rail from the American execution facilities at Shepton Mallet. They were not transferred to Cambridge in 1948, but instead reburied in unmarked graves at Oise-Aisne American Cemetery Plot E, a dedicated site for US servicemen executed during the Second World War.) The railway service had been suspended in 1941, and North station (renamed North Bar after the ending of rail services) was used as a temporary mortuary to hold these bodies while awaiting shipment to the USA or Cambridge. As the branch line into the cemetery was no longer in use, temporary platforms were built on the branch line serving the National Rifle Association's shooting range at Bisley, on the opposite side of the LSWR line from the cemetery. Following the removal of the US war graves the site in which they had been buried was divided into cemeteries for the Free French forces and Italian prisoners of war.  Rolling stock  = Locomotives = alt=Small green steam locomotive Under the terms of the 1852 agreement and Act of Parliament establishing the London Necropolis Company, the LSWR (after 1923 the SR) provided the locomotives and crew for London Necropolis Railway operations. There was no dedicated LNC locomotive, the trains being worked by any suitable locomotive. (Before the 1864 improvements to Necropolis Junction, locomotives rarely entered the cemetery branch line itself and the trains were generally hauled along the branch line by horses.) Towards the end of the railway's operations in the 1930s the route was almost always worked by LSWR M7 class locomotives, usually No. 255\\\\. = Passenger carriages = The passenger carriages used on the London Necropolis Railway were not owned by the LNC, but loaned from the LSWR. A set of carriages was permanently loaned, rather than carriages being lent as needed, as the LSWR was concerned that passengers might be discouraged from using regular LSWR services if they knew that their carriages had potentially carried dead bodies recently. The original set of carriages, used between 1854 and 1899, were four-wheeled carriages to a design by Joseph Hamilton Beattie. Little is recorded about the number and specifications of the carriages. The same set of carriages remained in use for over 40 years, prompting increasingly strong complaints from the LNC about their deteriorating quality. As part of an 1896 agreement by which the LSWR re-equipped the LNC in conjunction with the repositioning of the LNC's London terminus, the LNC demanded that the new passenger carriages to be supplied by the LSWR be \\"of a quality and a character not inferior to [the LSWR's] ordinary main line traffic\\". These new carriages were supplied late in the 19th century, probably in December 1899. They were all six-wheeled, and comprised two passenger brake vans each containing three third class compartments, a baggage compartment and the guard's compartment; a passenger carriage divided into three first class and two second class compartments; and a passenger carriage divided into five third class compartments (also used as all second class). Although not recorded, it is likely that other carriages were also permanently loaned to the LNC for use as needed. This set of carriages only remained in use for a short period, and in 1907 was replaced by a new set of carriages of which little is known. In 1917 this set was itself replaced by two passenger brake vans each containing two first and four third class compartments, a carriage with three first and three third class compartments, and a carriage with six third class compartments. This set operated for most of the inter-war period, being withdrawn in April 1938. It was replaced by a very similar set of coaches at this time, which was withdrawn in September 1939 after the outbreak of hostilities for use in troop trains. The carriages were replaced by the former Royal Train, built 1900‚Äì04, of the now-defunct South Eastern and Chatham Railway. These ornately decorated carriages were those destroyed in the 1941 bombing of the London terminus. = Hearse vans = Unlike the loaned locomotives and passenger carriages, the LNC owned its dedicated hearse vans outright. Despite this, they were always painted in whichever colour scheme was currently in use by the LSWR (SR after 1923), to match the livery of the passenger cars and locomotives loaned to the LNC. As with the carriages for living passengers, the hearse vans were designed to prevent bodies mixing with those from different backgrounds. Each of the original vans was partitioned into twelve sections in two rows of six, each capable of holding one coffin; later vans were of a slightly different design and probably carried 14 coffins. The vans were fitted with internal partitions to divide first, second and third class coffins. The LNC intended to use half the hearse vans for Anglican and half for Nonconformist coffins, to prevent Anglicans from sharing a carriage with Nonconformists, but in practice this arrangement was little used. Unlike traditional Victorian funerals, in which the hearse invariably led the funeral procession, photographic evidence shows that the LNC sometimes placed the hearse van at the rear of the train. (Because trains reversed from Necropolis Junction into the cemetery, no matter which arrangement was used the hearse van would inevitably be at the rear of the train for part of the journey.) The LNC ordered six hearse vans in 1854, two of which were operational at the time the cemetery and Necropolis Railway opened. Their origins are not recorded, although they were bought very cheaply suggesting that they were conversions of existing carriages rather than built to order. Many LNC records from this period have been lost and it is not certain how many hearse vans were delivered, and how they were used; records suggest that anything between three and ten hearse vans were bought or leased by the LNC in the early years of operations. (As each van carried 12‚Äì14 coffins and it is known that some funeral trains in the late 19th century carried over 60 coffins, at least six hearse vans must have been in use.) As part of the settlement during the relocation of the London terminus, two new hearse vans were given to the LNC by the LSWR in 1899. These new hearse vans were longer, and divided into three levels with compartments for eight coffins on each, for a total of 24 coffins per van. These replaced the existing hearse vans and remained in use until the closure of the Necropolis Railway. One of the vans was destroyed in the 1941 bombing of the London terminus; the other was transferred to the SR and remained in use until at least 1950. The former Royal Train brought into passenger service on the London Necropolis Railway in 1939 had a large amount of luggage space, and it is probable that when funeral traffic was light the hearse vans were not used and the coffins carried in the luggage space.  Cemetery stations  On William Cubitt's advice the two stations in the cemetery were built as temporary structures, in the expectation that they would need to be rebuilt once the railway was operational and the issues with operating a railway of this unique nature became clearer. Both were designed by Sydney Smirke, who presented his designs to the LNC in March 1854. Each station was built as a one-storey building around a square courtyard. The side adjacent to the railway line was left open, and wings extended from the building along the platform on each side. Other than the brick platform faces, chimneys and foundations, the stations were built entirely of wood. Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners, a first class and an ordinary refreshment room, and a set of apartments for LNC staff. The refreshment rooms at both stations were licensed (permitted to sell alcohol). The train crews would generally wait in these refreshment rooms until the trains were ready to return to London, and on at least one occasion (on 12 January 1867) the driver became so drunk that the fireman had to drive the train back to London. This incident prompted a complaint from the LSWR and from that time the LNC provided the train crew with a free lunch, provided they drank no more than one pint of beer. In mid-1855 cellars were dug beneath the stations, and the coffin reception rooms at each station were converted into \\"pauper waiting rooms\\". Neither station was equipped with gas or electricity; throughout their existence the buildings were lit by oil lamps and coal ranges were used for heating and cooking. The platform faces themselves incorporated an indentation, one brick-width deep and the width of the courtyard. This indentation facilitated the unloading of coffins from the lower levels of the hearse carriages. On arrival at the stations coffins would usually be unloaded onto a hand-drawn bier and pulled by LNC staff to the appropriate chapel. While this was taking place the mourners were escorted to the waiting rooms at the station. On arrival at the chapels first and second class funerals would generally have a brief service (third class funerals had a single service in the appropriate chapel for all those being buried). For those burials where the funeral service had already been held at either a parish church or the LNC's London terminus the coffins would be taken directly from the train to the grave. = North station = alt=A train on a single rail track near a small white wooden station. North station, serving Roman Catholics, Parsees, Jews and Nonconformist Christians as well as some groups with dedicated plots in the northern cemetery such as actors and Oddfellows, was the first station on the branch. At the time the cemetery opened North station incorporated the lodgings of James Bailey, superintendent of the Nonconformist cemetery. In 1861 Bailey became the sole cemetery superintendent and moved into a cottage elsewhere on the grounds, and his apartment was given to Richard Lee, a cemetery porter. Census records show Lee living at North station, until 1865 with his mother Ann and later with his wife Charlotte, until at least 1871. A number of cemetery staff lived in the station apartment until the 1950s. By this time the railway itself had closed but the station's refreshment kiosk remained open. Steps led from the long platform to a path leading to a chapel, on a hilltop behind the station. Between 1942 and 1944 large numbers of Allied service personnel were buried in the military section of Brookwood cemetery. On the authority of Thomas B. Larkin, Quartermaster General of the United States Army, 3,600 bodies of US servicemen were exhumed in January‚ÄìMay 1948 and shipped to the United States for reburial. The railway service had been suspended in 1941, and North station (renamed North Bar after the ending of rail services) was used as a temporary mortuary to hold these bodies while awaiting shipment to the USA. On the retirement in 1956 of a Mr and Mrs Dendy, who operated the refreshment kiosk in the station building from 1948 to 1956 and lived in the station apartment, the building was abandoned. It was demolished in the 1960s owing to dry rot. = South station = The design of South station was broadly similar to that of North station. Unlike the platform steps of North station, the platform of South station had a ramp leading to an Anglican chapel at the northern end of the platform. A shed adjacent to the station held hand-drawn biers, used to transport coffins around the large southern cemetery. At the time the branch line opened the platform of South station was only long, far shorter than the platform of North station. At some point the platform was greatly extended south from the station building to a total length of , allowing equipment to be unloaded discreetly without disturbing users of the station. At the time of opening the apartment in the station housed George Bupell, superintendent of the Anglican cemetery. As with the North station, once James Bailey became sole cemetery superintendent in 1861 the use of the apartment was granted to a cemetery porter, and housed a succession of cemetery staff over the years. Following the suspension of railway services in 1941 the building was renamed South Bar, and remained in use as a refreshment kiosk. The last operators of the kiosk, Mr and Mrs Ladd, retired in the late 1960s and from then on the station building was used as a cemetery storeroom. Around half the building was destroyed by fire in September 1972. The building was popular with railway and architectural enthusiasts as a distinctive piece of Victorian railway architecture, but despite a lobbying campaign to preserve the surviving sections of the station the remaining buildings (other than the platform itself) were demolished shortly afterwards. By the time of its demolition the \\"temporary\\" structure was 118 years old. = Brookwood station = At the time the cemetery opened, the nearest railway station other than those on the cemetery branch was Woking railway station, away. As only one train per day ran from London to the cemetery stations and even that ran only when funerals were due to take place, access to the cemetery was difficult for mourners and LNC staff. Although in the negotiations leading to the creation of the cemetery the LSWR had told the LNC that they planned to build a main line station near the cemetery, they had not done so. In 1863, with the cemetery fully operational and a planned new lunatic asylum near Brookwood likely to boost traffic, the LSWR agreed to build a mainline station at Brookwood, along with an improved Necropolis Junction and a goods yard, provided the LNC supplied the necessary land and built the approach road and stationmaster's house for the new station. The new station, called Brookwood (Necropolis) railway station (the suffix was gradually dropped), opened on 1 June 1864. A substantial commuter village grew around the northern (i.e. non-cemetery) side of the new station, and the station building (on the northern side of the tracks) was enlarged in 1890. In conjunction with these works, a branch line was added in 1890 from a bay platform to the National Rifle Association's shooting range at Bisley, running west to the north of the LSWR main line before curving north to Bisley. In 1903 the quadrupling of the LSWR tracks necessitated a major rebuilding of the station. The down (westbound) platform was demolished, and a new long down platform was built, along with a second station building facing the cemetery, from which a footpath led across the cemetery branch's tracks and into the cemetery.  London stations  A site for the London terminus near Waterloo was suggested by Sir Richard Broun. Its proximity to the Thames meant that bodies could be cheaply transported to the terminus by water from much of London, and the area was easily accessed from both north and south of the river by road. The arches of the huge brick viaduct carrying the LSWR into Waterloo Bridge station (now London Waterloo station) were easily converted into mortuaries. Broun also felt that the journey out of London from Waterloo Bridge would be less distressing for mourners; while most of the rail routes out of London ran through tunnels and deep cuttings or through densely populated areas, at this time the urban development of what is now south London had not taken place and the LSWR route ran almost entirely through parkland and countryside. The LNC also contemplated taking over the LSWR's former terminus at Nine Elms railway station (which following the 1848 opening of the much more convenient Waterloo Bridge station was used only for goods traffic, chartered trains taking migrants to North America, and the private trains of the royal family) as either the main or a secondary terminus. Despite objections from local residents concerned about the effects of potentially large numbers of dead bodies being stored in a largely residential area, in March 1854 the LNC settled on a single terminus in Waterloo and purchased a plot of land between Westminster Bridge Road and York Street (now Leake Street) for the site. Architect William Tite and engineer William Cubitt drew up a design for a station, which was approved in June 1854. = First London terminus (1854‚Äì1902) = The Westminster Bridge Road entrance to the first London terminus. The ornate gates were originally made for alt=Three-story office building next to a railway arch, with an ornate gate in front of it. Tite and Cubitt's design was based around a three-storey main building, separated from the LSWR's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC's twin rail lines, intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly, and avoid the need for hearses to stop in the public road. The building housed two mortuaries, the LNC's boardroom and funerary workshops, and a series of separate waiting rooms for those attending first, second and third class funerals. A steam-powered lift carried coffins from the lower floors to the platform level above. Although the original London terminus did not have its own chapel, on some occasions mourners would not be able or willing to make the journey to a ceremony at Brookwood but for personal or religious reasons were unable to hold the funeral service in a London church. On these occasions one of the waiting rooms would be used as a makeshift funeral chapel. As the site of the station was adjacent to the arches of the LSWR's viaduct, it blocked any increase in the number of lines serving Waterloo station (renamed from Waterloo Bridge station in 1886). Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London, through which trains from Waterloo ran, led to congestion at the station and in 1896 the LSWR formally presented the LNC with a proposal to provide the LNC with a new station in return for the site of the existing terminus. The LNC agreed to the proposals, in return for the LSWR granting the LNC control of the design of the new station and leasing the new station to the LNC for a token rent in perpetuity, providing new rolling stock, removing any limit on the number of passengers using the Necropolis service, and providing the free carriage of machinery and equipment to be used in the cemetery. Although the LSWR was extremely unhappy at what they considered excessive demands, in May 1899 the companies signed an agreement, in which the LSWR gave in to every LNC demand. In addition the LSWR paid ¬£12,000 compensation (about ¬£ in terms of consumer spending power) for the inconvenience of relocating the LNC station and offices, and agreed that mourners returning from the cemetery could travel on any LSWR train to Waterloo, Vauxhall or Clapham Junction. = Second London terminus (1902‚Äì1941) = alt=Narrow four storey red building above a wide archway A site for the replacement terminus was bought by the LSWR in 1899, south of the existing site and on the opposite side of Westminster Bridge Road. It was completed on 8 February 1902, and the LSWR viaduct was widened to serve a greatly enlarged Waterloo station, destroying all traces of the original LNC terminus. The new building was designed for attractiveness and modernity to contrast with the traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry. A narrow four- storey building on Westminster Bridge Road held the LNC's offices. Behind it was the main terminal; this held a communal third-class waiting room, mortuaries and storerooms, the LNC's workshops, and a sumptuous oak-panelled Chapelle Ardente, intended for mourners unable to make the journey to Brookwood to pay their respects to the deceased. This building led onto the two platforms, lined with waiting rooms and a ticket office. = Destruction = alt=A railway platform strewn with rubble. Broken girders jut out above the platform, while alongside the platform a set of railway lines stop abruptly at a large crater. Next to the railway line is a burned-out railway carriage tilted at an acute angle. During the Second World War Waterloo station and the nearby Thames bridges were a significant target for Axis bombing, and there were several near-misses on the station during the London Blitz of 1940‚Äì41. Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was undamaged during the early stages of the bombing campaign. During the night of 16‚Äì17 April 1941, in one of the last major air raids on London, bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area. The rolling stock berthed in the Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was damaged, but the terminal building itself remained unscathed. At 10.30 pm multiple incendiary devices and high explosive bombs struck the central section of the terminus building. While the office building and platforms survived, the workshops, driveway and Chapelle Ardente were destroyed, along with the third class waiting room. The Southern Railway's Divisional Engineer inspected the damage at 2.00 pm on 17 April, and his report read simply \\"Necropolis and buildings demolished\\". On 11 May 1941 the station was officially declared closed. The last recorded funeral party carried on the London Necropolis Railway was that of Chelsea Pensioner Edward Irish (1868‚Äì1941), buried on 11 April 1941. The Southern Railway offered the LNC the temporary use of platform 11 or 12 of Waterloo station to allow the service to be continued, but refused to allow the LNC to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling to and from the cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day, meaning those visiting the cemetery other than members of funeral parties had little reason to choose the LNC's irregular and infrequent trains over the SR's fast and frequent services to Brookwood. The LNC attempted to negotiate a deal by which genuine mourners could still travel cheaply to the cemetery on the 11.57 am service to Brookwood (the SR service closest to the LNC's traditional departure time), but the SR management, themselves under severe financial pressure owing to wartime constraints and damage, refused to entertain any compromise.  Closure  In September 1945, following the end of hostilities, the directors of the LNC met to consider whether to rebuild the terminus and reopen the London Necropolis Railway. Although the main line from Waterloo to Brookwood had remained in use throughout the war and was in good condition, the branch line from Brookwood into the cemetery had been almost unused since the destruction of the London terminus. It was in extremely poor condition, the soil causing it to deteriorate even when it had been in use and regularly maintained. Although the original promoters of the scheme had envisaged Brookwood Cemetery becoming London's main or only cemetery, the scheme had never been as popular as they had hoped. In the original proposal, Richard Broun had calculated that over its first century of operations the cemetery would have seen around five million burials at a rate of 50,000 per year, the great majority of which would have utilised the railway. In reality at the time the last train ran on 11 April 1941, almost 87 years after opening, only 203,041 people had been buried in the cemetery. Before the outbreak of hostilities, increased use of motorised road transport had damaged the profitability of the railway for both the LNC and the Southern Railway. Faced with the costs of rebuilding the cemetery branch line, building a new London terminus and replacing the rolling stock damaged or destroyed in the air raid, the directors concluded that \\"past experience and present changed conditions made the running of the Necropolis private train obsolete\\". In mid-1946 the LNC formally informed the SR that the Westminster Bridge Road terminus would not be reopened. alt=Short length of railway track and a metal sign The decision prompted complicated negotiations with the SR over the future of the LNC facilities in London. In December 1946 the directors of the two companies finally reached agreement. The railway-related portions of the terminus site (the waiting rooms, the caretaker's flat and the platforms themselves) would pass into the direct ownership of the SR, while the remaining surviving portions of the site (the office block on Westminster Bridge Road, the driveway and the ruined central portion of the site) would pass to the LNC to use or dispose of as they saw fit. The LNC sold the site to the British Humane Association in May 1947 for ¬£21,000 (about ¬£ in terms of consumer spending power), and the offices of the LNC were transferred to the Superintendent's Office at Brookwood. The SR continued to use the surviving sections of the track as occasional sidings into the 1950s, before clearing what remained of their section of the site. While most of the LNC's business was now operated by road, an agreement on 13 May 1946 allowed the LNC to make use of SR services from Waterloo to Brookwood station for funerals, subject to the condition that should the service be heavily used the SR (British Railways after 1948) reserved the right to restrict the number of funeral parties on any given train. Although one of the LNC's hearse carriages had survived the bombing it is unlikely that this was ever used, and coffins were carried in the luggage space of the SR's coaches. Coffins would either be shipped to Brookwood ahead of the funeral party and transported by road to one of the mortuaries at the disused cemetery stations, or travel on the same SR train as the funeral party to Brookwood and be transported from Brookwood station to the burial site or chapel by road. Although the LNC proposed to convert the cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After the closure of the branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.  After closure  alt=Steam train passing through an almost deserted station, with very tall trees in the background Following the 1947 nationalisation of Britain's railways, the use of the railway to transport coffins to Brookwood went into steep decline. New operating procedures required that coffins be carried in a separate carriage from other cargo; as regular services to Brookwood station used electric multiple unit trains which did not have goods vans, coffins for Brookwood had to be shipped to Woking and then carried by road for the last part of the journey, or a special train had to be chartered. The last railway funeral to be carried by British Rail anywhere was that of Lord Mountbatten in September 1979, and from 28 March 1988 British Rail formally ceased to carry coffins altogether. Since Mountbatten, the only railway funeral to be held in the United Kingdom has been that of former National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers General Secretary Jimmy Knapp, carried from London to Kilmarnock for burial in August 2001. = Stations = Most of the site of the 1902 London terminus was built over with new office developments in the years following the end of the Second World War, but the office building on Westminster Bridge Road, over the former entrance to the station driveway, remains relatively unaltered externally although the words \\"London Necropolis\\" carved into the stone above the driveway have been covered. Refurbishments and cleaning in the 1980s restored the facade of the building to an appearance similar to that of the time of its building. Other than iron columns in Newnham Terrace which once supported the Necropolis Railway tracks, and a surviving section of the internal driveway used as a car park, the Westminster Bridge Road building is the only surviving part of the London Necropolis Railway in London. Brookwood station on the former LSWR line (now the South Western Main Line and the Alton Line) is little changed since the 1903 expansion and rebuilding. It remains in use both by commuters from the village which has grown to the north of the railway line, and by visitors to the cemetery to the south of the line. A small monument to the London Necropolis Railway, consisting of a short length of railway track on the former trackbed, was erected in 2007 outside the southern (cemetery-side) entrance to the station. The site of North station has significantly changed. The ornate mausoleum of Sharif Al-Hussein Ben Ali (d. 1998) stands directly opposite the remains of the platform. The operators of the Shia Islamic section have planted Leylandii along its boundary, which includes the platform of North station. Unless the trees are removed, the remains of the station will ultimately become hidden and destroyed by overgrowth. The land surrounding the site of South station and the station's two Anglican chapels were redundant following the closure of the railway. As part of the London Necropolis Act 1956 the LNC obtained Parliamentary consent to convert the disused original Anglican chapel into a crematorium, using the newer chapel for funeral services and the station building for coffin storage and as a refreshment room for those attending cremations. Suffering cash flow problems and distracted by a succession of hostile takeover bids, the LNC management never proceeded with the scheme and the buildings fell into disuse. The station building was demolished after being damaged by a fire in 1972, although the platform remained intact. alt=Gabled building with a railway platform behind it. Since 1982 the site of South station has been owned by the St. Edward Brotherhood, and forms part of a Russian Orthodox monastery. The original Anglican chapel is used as a visitor's centre and living quarters for the monastery, while the larger Anglican chapel built in 1908‚Äì09 immediately north of the station is now the Russian Orthodox Church of St. Edward the Martyr, and houses the relics and shrine of Edward the Martyr, king of England from 975‚Äì978 AD. The site of the former station buildings is now the main monastery building, while the platform itself remains intact and now marks the boundary of the monastic enclosure. = Brookwood Cemetery and the LNC = The LNC continued to lobby the SR and its 1948 successor British Railways until the 1950s on the matter of cheap fares for visitors to the cemetery, but were unable to come to any agreement. In 1957 the Southern Region of British Railways considered allowing the LNC to sell discounted fares of 7s 6d (compared to the standard rate of 9s 4d) for day return tickets from London to Brookwood. By this time most visitors to the cemetery were travelling by road. The LNC felt that the relatively minor difference between the fares would not be sufficient to attract visitors back to the railway, and the proposal was abandoned. With the area around Woking by this time heavily populated, the LNC's land holdings had become an extremely valuable asset, and from 1955 onwards the LNC became a target for repeated hostile takeover bids from property speculators. In January 1959 the Alliance Property Company announced the successful takeover of the London Necropolis Company, bringing over a century of independence to an end. Alliance Property was a property company with little interest in the funeral business, and the income from burials was insufficient to maintain the cemetery grounds. Brookwood Cemetery went into decline and the cemetery began to revert to wilderness. This trend continued under a succession of further owners. The Brookwood Cemetery Act 1975 authorised the cemetery's owners (at that time Maximilian Investments) to sell surplus land within the cemetery's boundaries, leading to the construction of a major office development on the site of the former Superintendent's office, near the former level crossing between the northern and southern cemeteries. The masonry works remained operational until the early 1980s, and were then converted into office buildings and named Stonemason's Court. In March 1985 the cemetery was bought by Ramadan G√ºney, whose family still owns the cemetery as of 2011. The Guney family embarked on a programme of encouraging new burials in the cemetery, and of slowly clearing the overgrown sections. alt=Very overgrown cemetery While it was never as successful as planned, Brookwood Cemetery remains the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom and one of the largest in the world. Although not the world's only dedicated funeral railway line, the London Necropolis Railway was the first, the longest lasting and by far the best known. As well as forming a key element of Basil Copper's novel Necropolis (1980), the railway and cemetery received widespread attention following the 2002 publication of Andrew Martin's novel The Necropolis Railway (2002). Both books were critically acclaimed and led to increased public interest in the London Necropolis Company and its railway operations. It also plays a pivotal role in the sci-fi fantasy novel The Fuller Memorandum (2010) by Charles Stross.

R. S. Yorke and built in 1936 at Ashton Court near Bristol in England. After leaving Germany, Breuer spent 1935‚Äì37 working in London for the Isokon company, and in partnership with Yorke. At this time Crofton Gane was the proprietor of P. E. Gane, a Bristol furniture manufacturing company. He became interested in modernist design and gained an introduction to Breuer via Isokon's proprietor, Jack Pritchard. Breuer redesigned Crofton Gane's own house in Bristol. Gane commissioned the pavilion as a showroom to display his range of products at the 1936 Royal Show, which that year was held at Ashton Court. The five-day event opened on 30 June 1936. The pavilion, designed by Breuer and Yorke, was a flat-roofed building with planes of local stone and glass walls. The interior was finished with plywood. The pavilion's importance for modernism lay in innovations such as use of exposed stone for the walls, and the walls' arrangement in a free pattern allowing interior and exterior spaces to flow into each other. The pavilion's design was a precursor of some of Breuer's subsequent achievements in America. Breuer later stated that it was one of his two favourite works, after the UNESCO Headquarters building in Paris.

Hyde, 466 U.S. 2 (1984), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held the analysis of the tying issue must focus on the hospital's sale of services to its patients, rather than its contractual arrangements with the providers of anesthesiological services. In making that analysis, consideration must be given to whether petitioners are selling two separate products that may be tied together, and, if so, whether they have used their market power to force their patients to accept the tying arrangement. It set a permissive precedent in antitrust law, as some viewed tying as always anticompetitive.  Rationale  Any inquiry into the validity of a tying arrangement must focus on the market or markets in which the two products are sold, for that is where the anticompetitive forcing has its impact. Thus, in this case, the analysis of the tying issue must focus on the hospital's sale of services to its patients, rather than its contractual arrangements with the providers of anesthesiological services. In making that analysis, consideration must be given to whether petitioners are selling two separate products that may be tied together, and, if so, whether they have used their market power to force their patients to accept the tying arrangement. There is no evidence that the price, quality, or supply or demand for either the \\"tying product\\" or the \\"tied product\\" has been adversely affected by the exclusive contract, and no showing that the market as a whole has been affected at all by the contract.

Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Company, 549 U.S. 312 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case related to antitrust regulations.  Background  Both parties operated sawmills; Ross-Simmons was driven out of business by what it complained was Weyerhaeuser's attempted monopsonization of the market. The theory was \\"predatory buying\\": a purchaser buys so much of a given raw material that it drives up the price and thereby excludes less pecunious rivals who depend on the same raw material.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court rejected the theory on a rule of reason analysis, noting that there are any number of legitimate business strategies that involve buying large quantities of raw materials. A plaintiff alleging predatory buying must therefore prove‚Äîand Ross-Simmons had not‚Äîthat the defendant caused the price to rise, and that the defendant is likely to recoup the costs incurred in such a scheme. The Court's decision symmetrized its case law, with Weyerhaeuser and Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. applying identical standards to predatory buying and predatory selling claims respectively.

The collar mark (later shoulder mark) and cap of a Ferik had three stripes and two stars during the early years of the Turkish Republic.

MLB 2K11 is available for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, and Wii. Commentators The commentary is delivered by the trio of Steve Phillips, Gary Thorne, and John Kruk. Kruk is absent in the Wii version. New features =PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3= The \\"main\\" version of MLB 2K11 retains the features of Major League Baseball 2K10 but adds new content. Some of the new features include the Dynamic Player Rating System (DPRS), which updates a players ability with the last four weeks of a real player's activity, which will include slumps and hot streaks. The DPRS will only affect hitting and pitching; it will not affect a player's fielding ability. There will be no option to play without the DRPS turned on, however, the DPRS does not affect trades, due to the DPRS being a short term value. Franchise modes will reflect player values based on franchise stats, not real life. The My Player career mode has similarly been improved and tweaked. The umpires will now have a more random strike zone, while pitch ratings affect ability to locate pitches. The game will feature more AI gameplay sliders than any MLB 2K game before, and for the first time, tweaking sliders will not affect achievements. Poor fielders will be \\"locked out\\" of good animations, and the fielding rating will affect how close to the ball the fielder must be to reach it. Base stealing has been revamped, and will take into account many variables such as the speed of the runner, type of pitch, lead, and the catcher's arm. =Wii= The Wii has its own unique features, including the Mini-Diamond, a new multiplayer mode set in fantasy venues, such as a low gravity Space ballpark to a Circus environment, while the Total Control Pitching and Hitting feature utilizes the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. The Wii version also retains the Franchise, Tournament and Home Run Derby modes of the main version. There is no \\"My Player\\" or \\"MLB Today\\" career mode for the Wii. =PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable= The PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable versions are less feature-rich than the main version, but they still feature Franchise and Season play, the Home Run Derby and a unique Manager Showdown feature in which a player sets up a lineup and a starting pitcher and plays the game strictly from the manager's role as strategist. The PSP version adds The Farm, which allows the player to engage in Minor League Baseball games. =Nintendo DS= The Nintendo DS version features both a Season Mode and a Postseason Mode, as well as utilizing the touch screen for the Total Control Pitching and Hitting Feature. The game also features 250 collectible virtual trading cards. Promotion In January, game publisher 2K Sports announced that they would continue a contest from the previous year. Players had a chance to win $1,000,000 for pitching a perfect game on the Xbox 360 or PS3 versions of the game. The contest began on April 1, 2011. This caused controversy as former WWE wrestler, Stevie Richards had done this before and tried to claim the Million dollars for the Perfect Game he had pitched but had done it before the contest officially began. Brian Kingrey, a music teacher from Hammond, Louisiana, claimed the prize by throwing a perfect game with Roy Halladay within two hours of the start of the contest. Reception Reception for the game has been mixed. IGN rated both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions with a 7.0 while the readers favored the 360 version of the game over the PS3 ranging from a 7.3 out of 10 for the 360 to a 6.5 out of 10 for the PS3. The 360 version of the game ran at a smoother frame rate according to most reviews. GameZone gave the game a 7/10, stating \\"Overall, it is still a unique baseball experience, but unfortunately, after playing it for a little while, you will want an improved product. Let‚Äôs hope for something even better in 2012.\\" GameSpot gave the game a 7.5/10, praising its online mode improvements but criticizing its lack of significant changes from last year's version of the game.GameSpot review There were also complaints of several bugs, such as the player fatigue in Franchise mode (player energy would decrease if a game was simulated, but not if the game was actually played) and injury recovery (pitchers who were on \\"rehab assignments\\" after injuries would not appear in management screens for setting pitching rotations, yet a player would have to clear a roster spot for him and could only access him from the bullpen; players affected by this bug also could not be demoted or promoted to different levels of the organization). One of the more frustrating aspects of the game is the extraordinarily poor managerial decisions made by computer- controlled teams. Intentional walks are often issued with only one out and under other conditions where such decisions would be unlikely in a real baseball game. Pitchers are removed from games too early, sometimes when pitching shutouts and showing no obvious signs of fatigue. The computer- controlled team will often attempt steals under unfavorable conditions, particularly attempts to steal third base when the computer-controlled team is down by multiple runs and the base runner is already in scoring position with strong batters coming to the plate. The computer-controlled team also tends to bring in a left-handed relief pitcher to face right-handed batters (and vice versa) when the bullpen has good right-handed relief pitchers available and the right-handed batter is more likely to make an out under such a match-up. Finally, the relief pitcher is often allowed to bat, even though they are going to be replaced in the next inning and the bench is full of potential batters.
