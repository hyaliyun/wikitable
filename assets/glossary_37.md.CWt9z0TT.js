Jesses allow a falconer to keep control of a bird while it is on the glove or in training, and allow a bird to be secured on a perch outside its aviary. Types Jesses come in various types: * Flying/Hunting jesses: short jesses without the swivel slit so as to not hamper the hawk as it flies or to snag on things as it moves from perch to perch‚Äîmainly to help control the bird while on the glove in the field. Flying jesses are often even smaller and lighter than hunting jesses, and are permanently attached to their anklets so they will not be lost; both types may have the swivel slit on them, based on the falconer's preference, but most often do not. * Mews jesses: long jesses that the hawk wears while it is in a mews or an aviary. * Traditional and Aylmeri: See below. Description Jesses are generally made from strips of leather as thin as possible, for which purpose kangaroo leather has become increasingly popular over the years, as it is thin, light-weight and extremely durable with proper care. Jess size varies depending on the bird, but the width is proportional to leg-length. Traditional jesses are made from a single length of leather, and slits are placed strategically along the jess to allow it to be looped through itself and around the ankle of the bird so that it fits comfortably but securely about and just above what would be the bird's ankle. With Aylmeri jesses, as created by Major Guy Aylmeri, the end of the jess is instead looped through itself repeatedly to form a \\"button\\", or knob at one end. The thin, pliable end of the jess is then threaded through an anklet worn by the bird, which is itself formed of another rectangular strip of leather, bound together at the ends by a grommet (usually of brass), prevented from slipping through the grommet by the knobbed end. Often, another slit is placed near the thin end of the jess cut about one inch long and running lengthwise, through which a special type of swivel is fitted, preventing the whole arrangement from twisting or tangling about itself or the bird when a leash is threaded through the other end. Their intent is more to prevent the risk of the bird deciding to chase something it shouldn't, and less to keep the bird from getting away, as falconry birds are routinely (and as part of the sport) set free‚Äîthe bond between bird and falconer serves as a much better leash than any leather or rope ever will; however, it is not always desirable that a bird be able to take flight at its own whim, and both on the glove and on the perch, jesses help ensure this. During hunting season (small game season for North American falconers), jesses are generally worn all season in the mews, and are often removed for the course of the spring/summer moult, when they are generally re-oiled and serviced as necessary.

S√£o Paulo was first commissioned in 1963 by the French Navy as and was transferred in 2000 to Brazil, where she became the new flagship of the Brazilian Navy. IHS Jane's reported that during its career with the Brazilian Navy, S√£o Paulo suffered from serviceability issues and never managed to operate for more than three months at a time without the need for repairs and maintenance.Brazil seeking to modernise Sao Paulo aircraft carrier, extend life to 2039, janes.com, 8 December 2014 On 14 February 2017, the navy announced the ship's demobilisation and subsequent decommissioning.. Background The aircraft carrier S√£o Paulo was built in France between 1957 and 1960, and served in the French Navy as Foch. In September 2000, she was purchased by Brazil for US$30 million ‚Äì no aircraft were included in the price ‚Äì to replace the aged World War II-era carrier , which had been in commission for over 40 years. Brazil had previously approached other countries, such as Spain, who wanted to construct a US$500 million carrier for Brazil, about the acquisition of a carrier. The government had already purchased a flotilla of 23 used A-4 Skyhawk fighter planes from Kuwait for $70 million; these planes, along with existing helicopters already in the national defense inventory, were to compose the S√£o Paulo fighter-bomber group. These A-4s (designated AF-1) are capable of carrying armament including rockets, free-fall bombs, and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. The Clemenceau-class aircraft carriers, of which S√£o Paulo is the last surviving member, are of conventional CATOBAR design. The flight deck is long by wide; the landing area is angled at 8 degrees off of the ship's axis. The forward aircraft elevator is to starboard, and the rear elevator is positioned on the deck edge to save hangar space. The forward of two catapults is on the bow to port; the second catapult is farther back on the angled landing deck. The hangar deck dimensions are by with overhead. In September 2000, S√£o Paulo was purchased while still operational, an unusual process for such a large ship. She was received by the Brazilian Navy and was incorporated into the Brazilian Navy on 15 November 2000. The incorporation of S√£o Paulo and the AF-1 fighter group marked the realization of Brazil's long-held goal of being able to conduct aerial defense of its naval forces with fixed-wing aircraft. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso noted during the transfer ceremony that: Since her construction, S√£o Paulo has received multiple upgrades, leaving her with a diverse range of technologies. The carrier arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 17 February 2001. Brazilian service AF-1 Skyhawk (A-4KU) on board S√£o Paulo In her first three years of service as S√£o Paulo, the ship completed several missions, some in foreign waters, particularly Operations ARAEX,. PASSEX, and TEMPEREX,. which is used annually to qualify and train the Argentine Navy's Super √âtendards and S-2T Turbo Trackers.. Toward the end of its commissioned life, S√£o Paulo mainly served to train pilots to fly carrier operations. She was actively used for the qualification and re-qualification of rotary and fixed-wing pilots (with about 500 catapult launches), and she was used during the first Brazilian exercises to practice carrier-based attack missions. =2005 fire= On 17 May 2005, an explosion took place in the steam network of the engine room.\\"Explosion kills one in Brazilian aircraft carrier\\". Xinhua.net. 18 May 2005 The explosion initially killed one crew member and injured ten others. All casualties were airlifted by helicopter to the Marcilio Dias Naval Hospital, Rio de Janeiro. Two of the injured crew later died in hospital from their injuries. Cause of the explosion was a rupture in the steam pipeline. After this accident, the Navy decided to undertake an extensive overhaul to repair and modernize the ship.Operti, Carlos Filipe, Pg. 36, Combat Aircraft Monthly, US Edition, Vol. 12, No. 12, December 2011 =Upgrade (2005‚Äì2010) and sea trials= View of the forward flight deck of the Brazilian aircraft carrier S√£o Paulo in 2003. Four McDonnell Douglas AF-1 (A-4) Skyhawk fighters and an Argentine Navy Grumman S-2T Tracker are visible. During 2005‚Äì10, S√£o Paulo underwent extensive modernization. The upgrade included inspection and repair of the steam turbines; maintenance of the surface condensers; retubing of boilers; repair of two high-pressure compressors; revision of the AC electrical generator; purchase of spare parts; maintenance of pumps, valves, and structural items; addition of two API oil-water separators; installation of two water cooling units; upgrade of the chemical oxygen generator; repair and treatment of oil tanks; substitution of the Naval Tactical Data System; installation of a closed-circuit television system; installation of an IFF transponder; installation of a MAGE system (ESM); flight deck inspection, repair, and painting; upgrade of the Optical Landing System processing unit; and revision of the aircraft catapults. The upgrade was completed in July 2009, and the S√£o Paulo was initially due to be fully operational by August 2010. Twelve Brazilian Navy A-4 Skyhawks were also scheduled to be upgraded by Embraer at a cost of $140 million. The upgrade was similar to the ones done for the AMX and F-5EM aircraft of the Brazilian Air Force. The program included restoring the aircraft and their current systems, as well as implementing new avionics, radar (specifically the Elta 2032 radar system), power production, and autonomous oxygen generating systems. Possible weapons to be included in the upgrade were MAA-1B, Python 4, and Derby AAMS. The Brazilian Navy contracted Marsh Aviation to convert four S-2T Turbo Trackers to an airborne early warning (AEW) configuration, and four more for tanking and Carrier Onboard Delivery duties. According to an article in the October 2010 issue of Air Forces Monthly, it has been confirmed that Brazil has purchased ex-Australian and ex-Uruguayan C-1 Trader airframes, for conversion into AEW planes and Tanker aircraft. All of the planes were to be upgraded to S-2T Turbo Tracker configuration with Honeywell TPE 331-14GR engines. The purchase included nine airframes, of which two were for tanker conversion to refuel the AF-1 Skyhawks, and three were for AEW. The rest were purchased as for spares or for cargo duties. The AEW radar requirement was to have a range of 250 miles at 25,000 feet. Operational lifespan for the airframes was to be 10 years. They were expected to be ready in 2011 and 2012. S√£o Paulos SH-3 helicopter fleet was to be replaced by six S-70B Seahawk helicopters. They were purchased in 2008, upgraded, and refurbished for delivery. The helicopters and a package of engines and support equipment were scheduled for delivery in 2009. At the end of 2010, sea trials began, and as of 2011 S√£o Paulo had been evaluated by the CIASA (Inspection Commission and Training Advisory). =Refit and decommissioning (2012‚Äì2018)= S√£o Paulo was expected to rejoin the fleet in late 2013, but suffered another major fire in 2012.. As of September 2016, she continued to undergo repairs; the commander of the Brazilian Navy, Admiral Eduardo Leal Ferreira, said plans were in place to renew the carrier's propulsion system. The ship's catapult was also reported to have problems. On 14 February 2017, the Navy announced the ship would be demobilised and subsequently decommissioned, citing the uneconomical cost of further repairs.. The Brazilian Navy formally decommissioned the aircraft carrier NAe S√£o Paulo on 22 November 2018.. As of February 2020, there is an effort to turn the ship into a museum. Crew S√£o Paulos complement was 1,920 (the ship's company is 64 officers and 1274 sailors, with an additional 582 in the air group).Navio Aer√≥dromo S√£o Paulo ‚Äì A 12 Poder Naval.

Early life and education Eurith Dickinson Rivers was born on December 1, 1895, in Center Point, Arkansas. He attended Young Harris College in North Georgia and settled in Cairo in South Georgia. Rivers also obtained a law degree through La Salle Extension University.Georgia Dept. of Archives and History (1925). Georgia's official register. Longino and Porter Rivers served as a Justice of the Peace, Cairo City Attorney, and Grady County Attorney. He later moved to another South Georgia community, Milltown (now called Lakeland), to become editor of the Lanier County News. Career Rivers was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1924 and to the Georgia State Senate in 1926. In 1928 and 1930, Rivers was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor. In 1932, he ran for the Georgia House of Representatives. He was elected Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives, serving from 1933 to 1937. His election as governor came after a stormy Democratic primary in 1936 in which the race served as a surrogate referendum on US President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Since Georgia did not allow three consecutive terms, Governor Eugene Talmadge was not eligible for re-election. Talmadge, who strongly opposed the New Deal and had delayed its implementation in Georgia, ran for the US Senate and backed Charles D. Redwine for governor. Rivers, who, as Speaker, had strongly supported the New Deal, was his opponent and won with about 60 percent of the vote, the same margin by which Talmadge lost his Senate race. Rivers' first two-year term as governor saw Georgia pass the legislation required to bring New Deal programs into the state, and was widely acclaimed. Rivers created the 7-month school year. Under Rivers' leadership, electrical services were expanded to rural areas of the state. Georgia moved from the lowest-ranked state to the top of the list in the number of rural electrification associations. When he was in office, the State Bureau of Unemployment Compensation was created, allowing Georgians to receive unemployment benefits. After Rivers' re-election in 1938, he ran into problems financing many of his improvement programs. Although the budget was reduced by 25 percent, he was able to convince the legislature to create the Georgia Housing Authority and obtain federal funds to build public housing. During Rivers' second term, there were political scandals and charges of corruption. Many of Rivers' appointees and staff members were charged with corrupt practices, and the charges reflected poorly on the governor. In 1939, Rivers proclaimed a state holiday for the December premiere of the film Gone With the Wind. Rivers sought the governorship again in 1946 but finished a distant third behind Eugene Talmadge and James V. Carmichael in the Democratic primary. Later life and death Rivers was never again elected to public office. He became a successful radio station owner. He died in Atlanta, Georgia in 1967 and is buried in the City Cemetery in Lakeland, Georgia. Rivers is the most recent Georgia governor to have been born outside the state.

It serves as a teaching hospital for Sydney Medical School at the University of Sydney and has approximately 700 beds. It is the referral hospital for Northern Sydney. Its primary referral area accommodates 5.7% of the Australian population or 17% of the NSW population. Introduction \\"Vanderfield Building\\" - Original design The Royal North Shore Hospital (RNSH) is a leading tertiary teaching hospital of The University of Sydney, University of Technology and Australian Catholic University. It is also a major Trauma Centre which provides specialised services in the areas of severe burns, neonatal intensive care, spinal cord injury and interventional radiology. The Kolling Institute of Medical Research is a health and medical research centre with a focus on research training. History The \\"Vanderfield Building\\" in 2016 It began as a cottage hospital located in Willoughby Rd, Crows Nest. The foundation stone was laid by Sir Henry Parkes, 18 June 1887. The hospital was opened with accommodation for fourteen patients, with the requisite office and rooms for the medical and nursing staff. Medical staff numbered four honorary doctors and nursing staff numbered five. The site of the original hospital was bounded by Willoughby Rd., Albany and Holterman Streets and Zig Zag Lane. The old site is now a busy part of the commercial centre of Crows Nest. In 1902, it opened on its current site at St Leonards, with 48 beds available for patients. New departments and wards were added over the next fifty years, reflecting the increasing diversity and professionalisation of health care. Between 1935 and 1940, polio treatment pioneer Sister Kenny Kenny travelled extensively throughout Australia helping to set up clinics. In the mid-thirties, she set up one of her pioneering clinics at RNSH. In 1940, the New South Wales government sent Kenny to America to present her clinical method for treating polio victims to American doctors. Doctors in Minnesota were with her work and convinced her to stay. Her treatments, which revolutionised the care of polio, caused as much controversy in the United States, as they had in Australia. Royal North Shore became a teaching hospital of the University of Sydney in 1947. Currently, the RNSH is a 600-bed hospital situated in St Leonards on Sydney's lower North Shore about 6 km from Sydney's Central Business District, surrounded by suburbs with some of the most stunning harbour views of Sydney. RNSH provides care to the local community, the Northern Sydney Health area (population: 777,000), New South Wales and also to the Pacific Island nations. In 2008 new facilities were procured under a PPP contract.

The committee was formally established on 23 October 2007, and tabled its report on 20 December 2007. The report made 45 recommendations. In early 2008, a Special Commission of Inquiry into Acute Care Services in NSW Public Hospitals was commissioned.Garling Report, Terms of Reference This comprehensive and ground breaking commission became known as The Garling Report. It reported in November 2008. The NSW State Government responded in March 2009. It found a \\"prevalent\\" problem associated with the care of the deteriorating patient in NSW public hospitals. As a result, a statewide system of monitoring vital signs to detect deteriorating patients was introduced. This system includes red and yellow \\"Between the Flags\\" colour-coded observation charts for recording a person's vital signs, allowing for easy visual recognition of deterioration. Observation charts have been developed for Adult, Paediatric, Maternity and Emergency patients. By 2012 it had been implemented in every public hospital in NSW. In August 2015, a patient of the outpatient diabetes clinic attended Royal North Shore Hospital for a routine appointment at 9:30am, the patient failed to present to the clinical staff and was subsequently listed as a \\"no-show\\" to his appointment. His spouse later concerned that partner had not returned from his appointment contacted Royal North Shore Hospital who advised that her partner did not attend his scheduled appointment. It was not until 6:30am the following day that a cleaner located the man in a public toilet within the hospital premises. It was found that the patient suffered a stroke. In August 2016, the Royal North Shore Hospital came under fire when it was revealed that doctors at the hospital were issuing restricted antibiotics to tens of thousands of patients, without seeking approval. Northern Sydney Local Health District's system through which approval to prescribe the powerful antibiotics is sought, called eASY, had not been used to generate any of these prescriptions. Use of the eASY system, designed to combat the spread of superbugs, had fallen to just 35% in May 2016. A foetus was incorrectly cremated in an incident in 2015 that resulted in the parents being unable to bury their child as per their wishes. The admission came after state budget estimates exposed a separate body swap at RNSH, in which the daughter of a deceased patient found that staff had incorrectly tagged her remains.

He was the younger brother of Constantine XI Palaiologos, the final Byzantine emperor. Thomas was appointed as Despot of the Morea by his oldest brother, Emperor John VIII Palaiologos, in 1428, joining his two brothers and other despots Theodore and Constantine, already governing the Morea. Though Theodore proved reluctant to cooperate with his brothers, Thomas and Constantine successfully worked to strengthen the despotate and expand its borders. In 1432, Thomas brought the remaining territories of the Latin Principality of Achaea, established during the Fourth Crusade more than two hundred years earlier, into Byzantine hands by marrying Catherine Zaccaria, daughter and heir to the principality. In 1449, Thomas supported the ascension of his brother Constantine, who then became Emperor Constantine XI, to the throne despite the machinations of his other brother, Demetrios, who himself desired the throne. After Constantine's rise to the throne, Demetrios was then assigned by Constantine to govern the Morea with Thomas but the two brothers found it difficult to cooperate, often quarreling with each other. In the aftermath of the Fall of Constantinople and end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II allowed Thomas and Demetrios to continue to rule as Ottoman vassals in the Morea. Thomas hoped to turn the small despotate into a rallying point of a campaign to restore the empire, hoping to gain support from the Papacy and Western Europe. Constant quarreling with Demetrios, who supported the Ottomans instead, eventually led Mehmed to invade and conquer the Morea in 1460. Thomas and his family, including his wife Catherine and his three younger children Zoe, Andreas and Manuel, escaped into exile to the Venetian-held city of Methoni and then to Corfu, where Catherine and the children stayed. In the hopes of raising support for a crusade to restore his lands in the Morea, and possibly the Byzantine Empire itself, Thomas travelled to Rome, where he was received and provided for by Pope Pius II. His hopes of retaking the Morea never materialized and he died in Rome on 12 May 1465. After his death, his claims were inherited by his oldest son Andreas, who also attempted to rally support for a campaign to restore the fallen despotate and the Byzantine Empire.  Biography  = Early life and appointment as despot = Miniature from an early 15th-century manuscript depicting Thomas's father Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, his mother Helena Draga≈° and his three oldest brothers John (later Emperor John VIII), Theodore and Andronikos As the Byzantine Empire fell apart and fragmented over the course of the 14th century, the emperors of the Palaiologan dynasty came to feel that the only sure way to keep their remaining holdings intact was to grant them to their sons, receiving the title of despot, as appanages to defend and govern. Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (1391‚Äì1425) had a total of six sons who survived infancy. Manuel's eldest surviving son, John, was raised to co-emperor and designated to succeed Manuel as sole emperor upon his death. The second eldest son, Theodore was designated as Despot of the Morea and the third eldest, Andronikos, was made Despot of Thessaloniki in 1408 at just eight years old. Manuel's younger sons, Constantine, Demetrios, and Thomas (the youngest, born in 1409, were kept in Constantinople as there was not sufficient land left to grant them. The younger children; Theodore, Andronikos, Constantine, Demetrios and Thomas were frequently described as having the distinction of Porphyrogennetos (\\"born in the purple\\"; born in the imperial palace during the reign of their father), a distinction that does not appear to have been shared by the emperor-to-be John. Relations between the Palaiologos brothers were not always good. Though the young John and Constantine appears to have got on well with each other, relations between Constantine and the younger Demetrios and Thomas were not as friendly. The complex relationships between the sons of Manuel II were put to the test when John, now Emperor John VIII, appointed Constantine as Despot of the Morea in 1428. Since his brother Theodore refused to step down from his role as despot, the despotate became governed by two members of the imperial family for the first time since its creation in 1349. Soon thereafter, the younger Thomas (aged 19) was also appointed as Despot of the Morea, meaning that the nominally undivided despotate had effectively disintegrated into three smaller principalities. Theodore did not make way for Constantine or Thomas in the despotate's capital, Mystras. Instead, Theodore granted Constantine lands throughout the Morea, including the northern harbor town of Aigio, fortresses and towns in Laconia (in the south), and Kalamata and Messenia in the west. Constantine made his capital as despot the town Glarentza. Meanwhile, Thomas was given lands in the north and based himself in the castle of Kalavryta. = Despot under the Byzantine Empire =  Strengthening the Morea  alt= Shortly after being appointed as despots, Constantine and Thomas, together with Theodore, decided to join forces in an attempt to seize the flourishing and strategic port of Patras in the north- west of the Morea, then under the rule of its Catholic Archbishop. The campaign, which was unsuccessful, possibly due to Theodore's reluctance to partake, was Thomas's first experience of war. Constantine later captured Patras on his own, ending 225 years of foreign ownership. Thomas's early tenure as Despot of the Morea was not without acquisitions either. For years, Thomas and Constantine had been eating away at the last remnants of the Principality of Achaea, a crusader state established during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 which had once governed almost the entire peninsula. It was Thomas who finally brought an end to the principality by marrying Catherine Zaccaria, daughter and heir of the final prince, Centurione II Zaccaria. With Centurione's death in 1432, Thomas could claim control over all of his remaining territories. By the 1430s, Thomas and Constantine had ensured that nearly the entire Peloponnese was once more in Byzantine hands for the first time since 1204, the only exception being the few port towns and cities held by the Republic of Venice. Murad II, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, which occupied most of the Byzantine Empire's former territory and had relegated the empire and the despotate as effectively vassal states, felt uneasy about the recent string of Byzantine successes in the Morea. In 1431, Turahan Bey, a Turkish general who governed Thessaly, sent his troops south to demolish the Morea's primary defensive fortifications, the Hexamilion wall, in an effort to remind the despots that they were the Sultan's vassals. In March 1432, Constantine, possibly desiring to be closer to Mystras, made a new territorial agreement, presumably approved by Theodore and John VIII, with Thomas. Thomas agreed to cede his fortress Kalavryta to Constantine, who made it his new capital, in exchange for Elis, which Thomas made his new capital. Though relations between the three despots thus appears to have been good in 1432, they soon soured. John VIII had no sons to succeed him and it was thus assumed that his successor would be one of his four surviving brothers (Andronikos having died some time before). John VIII's preferred successor was Constantine and though this choice was accepted by Thomas, who had developed good relations with his older brother, it was resented by the still older Theodore. When Constantine was summoned to the capital in 1435, Theodore believed this was to appoint Constantine as co-emperor and designated heir, which was not actually the case, and he too travelled to Constantinople to raise his objections. The quarrel between Constantine and Theodore was not resolved until the end of 1436, when the future Patriarch Gregory Mammas was sent to reconcile them and prevent civil war. When Constantine was summoned to act as regent in Constantinople while John VIII was away at the Council of Florence from 1437 to 1440, Theodore and Thomas stayed in the Morea. In November 1443, Constantine gave over control of Selymbria, which he had received after helping to deal with the rebellion of their younger brother Demetrios, to Theodore, who in turn abandoned his position as Despot of the Morea, making Constantine and Thomas the sole Despots of the Morea. Though this brought Theodore closer to Constantinople, it also made Constantine the ruler of the capital of the Morea and one of the most powerful men in the small empire. With Theodore and Demetrios out of their way, Constantine and Thomas hoped to strengthen the Morea, by now the cultural center of the Byzantine world, and make it a safe and nearly self-suffient principality. The philosopher Gemistus Pletho advocated that while Constantinople was the New Rome, Mystras and the Morea could become the \\"New Sparta\\", a centralized and strong Hellenic kingdom in its own right.  Turkish attacks and the accession of Constantine XI  Ruins of the Hexamilion wall, restored by Thomas and his brother Constantine to defend the Morea in 1444 and destroyed by the Ottomans in 1446 Among the actions taken during the brothers' project of strengthening the despotate was to reconstruct the Hexamilion wall, destroyed by the Turks in 1431. Together, they completely restored the wall, which was finished in March 1444. The wall was destroyed by the Turks again in 1446 after Constantine had attempted to expand his control northwards and had refused the sultan's demands of dismantling the wall. Constantine and Thomas were determined to hold the wall and had brought all their available forces, amounting to perhaps as many as twenty thousand men, to defend it. Despite this, the battle by the wall in 1446 was an overwhelming Turkish victory, with Constantine and Thomas barely escaping with their lives. Turahan Bey was sent south to take Mystras and devastate Constantine's lands while Sultan Murad II led his forces in the north of the Peloponnese. Although Turahan failed to take Mystras, this was of little consequence as Murad did not wish to conquer the Morea at the time, merely to instill terror, and the Turks soon left the peninsula, devastated and depopulated. Constantine and Thomas were in no position to ask for a truce and were forced to accept Murad as their lord and pay him tribute, promising to never again restore the Hexamilion wall. Their former co-despot Theodore died in June 1448, and on 31 October of the same year, Emperor John VIII passed away. The potential successors to the throne were Constantine, Demetrios and Thomas. John had not formally designated and heir, though everyone knew he favored Constantine and ultimately, the will of their mother, Helena Draga≈° (who also preferred Constantine), prevailed. Both Thomas, who had no intention of claiming the throne, and Demetrios, who most certainly did, hurried to Constantinople and reached the capital before Constantine. Though Demetrios was favored by many due to his anti-unionist sentiment, Helena reserved her right to act as regent until her eldest son, Constantine arrived, stalling Demetrios's attempt at seizing the throne. Thomas accepted Constantine's appointment and Demetrios, who soon thereafter joined in proclaiming Constantine as his new emperor, was overruled. Sphrantzes then informed Sultan Murad II, who also accepted the ascension of Constantine, now Emperor Constantine XI. In order to remove Demetrios from the capital and its vicinity, Constantine made Demetrios Despot of the Morea, to rule the despotate together with Thomas. Demetrios was granted Mystras and primarily ruled the southern and eastern parts of the despotate, with Thomas ruling Corinthia and the north-west, variously using Patras or Leontari as his capital. In 1451, Sultan Murad II, by then old and tired and having let go of all intentions of conquering Constantinople, died and was succeeded as sultan by his young and vigorous son Mehmed II, who was determined above all else to take the city. In 1452, during the preparation stages of the Ottoman siege of Constantinople, Constantine XI sent an urgent message to the Morea, requesting that one of his brothers bring their forces to help him defend the city. To prevent aid coming from the Morea, Mehmed II sent Turahan Bey to devastate the peninsula once more. The Turkish attack was repelled by an army commanded by Matthaios Asan, brother-in-law of Demetrios, but this victory came too late to offer any aid to Constantinople. = Continued rule in the Morea =  Initial tenure under Ottoman rule  The Despotate of the Morea 1450, showing the areas under control by Thomas and his brother Demetrios Constantinople ultimately fell on 29 May 1453, Constantine XI dying in its defense, ending the Byzantine Empire. In the aftermath of Constantinople's fall, and Constantine XI's death in defense of it, one of the most pressing threats to the new Ottoman regime was the possibility that one of Constantine XI's surviving relatives would find a following and return to reclaim the empire. Luckily for Mehmed II, the two despots in the Morea represented scarcely more than a nuisance and were allowed to keep their titles and lands. When emissaries of Thomas and Demetrios visited the Sultan at Adrianople some months after Constantinople's fall, the Sultan demanded no surrender of territory, only that the despots were to pay an annual tribute of 10,000 ducats. Because the Morea was allowed to continue to exist, many Byzantine refugees fled to the despotate, which made it somewhat of a Byzantine government-in-exile. Some of these influential refugees and courtiers even raised the idea of proclaiming Demetrios, the elder brother, as the Emperor of the Romans and the legitimate successor of Constantine XI. Both Thomas and Demetrios might have considered making their small despotate the rallying point of a campaign to restore the empire, with considerable fertile and wealthy territory under the despotate's control, there did seem for a moment to be a possibility that the empire could live on in the Morea. However, Thomas and Demetrios were never able to cooperate and spent most of their resources fighting each other rather than preparing for a struggle against the Turks. Since Thomas had spent most of his life in the Morea, and Demetrios most of his life elsewhere, the two brothers hardly knew each other. Shortly after Constantinople fell, a revolt broke out against the despots in the Morea, prompted by the many Albanian immigrants to the region being unhappy with the actions of the local Greek landowners. The Albanians had respected earlier despots, such as Constantine and Theodore, but despised the two current despots and without central authority from Constantinople, they saw their opportunity to gain control of the despotate for themselves. In Thomas's part of the despotate, the rebels chose to proclaim John Asen Zaccaria, bastard son of the last Prince of Achaea, as their leader and in Demetrios's part of the despotate, the leader of the revolt was Manuel Kantakouzenos, grandson of Demetrios I Kantakouzenos (who had served as despot until 1384) and great-great-grandson of Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos (1347‚Äì1354). With no hope of defeating the Albanians on their own, the despots appealed to the only power near enough and strong enough to aid them; the Ottomans. Mehmed II did not wish to see the despotate pass into the hands of Albanians, and out of his control, and sent an army to quell the rebellion in December 1453. The rebellion was not fully crushed until October 1454, when Turahan Bey arrived to aid the despots in firmly establishing their authority in the region. In return for the aid, Mehmed demanded a heavier tribute from Thomas and Demetrios, amounting to 12,000 ducats annually rather than the previous 10,000.  The possibility of Western aid  John Argyropoulos, sent as an envoy to the West by Thomas in 1456 Neither brother could raise the sum demanded by the Sultan and they were divided in their policies. While Demetrios, probably the more realistic of the two, had more or less given up hope of Christian aid from the west and thought it might be best to placate the Turks, Thomas retained hope that the Papacy might yet call for a crusade to restore the Byzantine Empire. Thomas's hopes were not ridiculous; the Fall of Constantinople had been received with as much horror in Western Europe as it had been in the few remaining Byzantine territories in the East. In September 1453, Pope Nicholas V issued the crusading bull Etsi ecclesia Christi, which called on Christians throughout the west to take the cross and embark on a crusade to recover Constantinople. The response was enthusiastic; some of Europe's most powerful and influential rulers came forward to take the cross, including Philip the Good of Burgundy in February 1454 and Alfonso the Magnanimous of Aragon and Naples in November 1455. Alfonso promised to personally lead a host of 50,000 men and 400 ships against the Ottomans. At Frankfurt, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III assembled a council of German princes and proposed that 40,000 men be sent to Hungary, where the Ottomans had suffered a crushing defeat at Belgrade in 1456. If the combined forces of Hungary, Aragon, Burgundy and the Holy Roman Empire had been unleashed to exploit the victory at Belgrade, Ottoman control of the Balkans would have been seriously threatened. Despite the Ottomans having secured the position of the two despots in the recent Albanian uprising, the possibility of Western aid to restore Byzantine territory proved too enticing to resist. In 1456, Thomas sent John Argyropoulos as an envoy to the West to discuss the possibility of aid for the Morea. Argyropolous had been a carefully thought- out choice since he had been an ardent supporter of the Council of Florence, which meant that he was well received by Pope Nicholas V's successor, Pope Callixtus III, in Rome. From Rome, Argyropoulos also moved on to Milan, England and France and further envoys were sent to Aragon (because of Alfonso's involvement in the crusading plans) and Venice (since Thomas were hoping that he could secure refuge in Venetian territory in the event of an Ottoman attack on the Morea). A crusade seemed so imminent that even the decidedly anti-Western Demetrios softened his anti-Latin stance and sent envoys of his own. Argyropoulos probably arrived in Rome at around the same time as Demetrios's envoy, Frankoulios Servopoulos, and the two envoys travelled through Europe, visiting the same courts, independently of each other. Thomas and Demetrios proved to be incapable of working together even with foreign diplomacy.  Moreot civil war and the fall of the Morea  Ruins of the castle at Patras, Thomas's seat as despot from 1449 until it was taken by the Ottomans in 1458 In the end, no crusade ever set out to combat the Ottomans. Due to their conviction that help would arrive, and being unable to pay, the two despots had not paid their annual tribute to the Ottomans for three years. With no money coming from the Morea, and the looming threat of Western aid, Mehmed eventually lost his patience with the Palaiologoi. The Ottoman army marched from Adrianople in May 1458 and entered the Morea, where the only real resistance was faced at Corinth, within the domain governed by Demetrios. Leaving his artillery to bombard and besiege that city, Mehmed left with most of his army to devastate and conquer the northern parts of the despotate, under Thomas's jurisdiction. Corinth at last gave up in August, after several cities in the north had already surrendered, and Mehmed imposed a heavy retribution on the Morea. The territory under the two brothers was drastically reduced, Corinth, Patras and much of the north-west of the peninsula were annexed into the Ottoman Empire and provided with Turkish governors, with the Palaiologoi only being allowed to keep the south, including the despotate's nominal capital, Mystras, on the condition that they paid their annual tribute to the sultan. Almost as soon as Mehmed had left the Morea, the two brothers began quarreling with each other again. Mehmed's victory had only increased the antagonism between Thomas and Demetrios. Demetrios had shifted to becoming even more pro-Ottoman after Mehmed had promised the despot that he would marry his daughter Helena, whereas Thomas increasingly hoped for western aid as the regions of the Morea annexed by Mehmed had been almost the entire area ruled by Thomas, including his capital of Patras. In January 1459, Thomas rebelled against Demetrios and the Ottomans, joining with a number of Albanian lords. They seized the fortress of Kalavryta and much of the land in the central Morea and besieged Kalamata and Mantineia, fortresses held by Demetrios. Demetrios responded by seizing Leontari and called for aid from the Turkish governors in the northern Morea. There were many attempts made to broker peace between the two brothers, such as Mehmed ordering the Bishop of Lacedaemon to make the two swear to keep the peace, but any truce lasted only briefly. Many of the Byzantine nobles in the Morea could only look on in horror as the civil war raged on. Byzantine historian George Sphrantzes summed up the conflict with the following words: Although Demetrios had more soldiers and resources, Thomas and the Albanians were able to appeal to the West for aid. After a successful skirmish against the Ottomans, Thomas sent 16 captured Turkish soldiers, alongside some of his armed guards, to Rome to convince the Pope that he was engaging in a holy war against the Muslims. The scheme worked and the Pope sent 300 Italian soldiers under the Milanese condottieri Gianone da Cremona to aid Thomas. With these reinforcements, Thomas gained the upper hand and it looked as if Demetrios was about to be defeated, having retreated to the town of Monemvasia and having sent Matthaios Asan to Adrianople to beg Mehmed for aid. Thomas's pleas to the west represented a real threat to the Ottomans, a threat made even greater through the support of the plan by the vocal Cardinal Bessarion, a Byzantine refugee who had escaped the empire years earlier. Pope Pius II convened a council in 1459 in Mantua and sent Bessarion and some others to preach for a crusade against the Ottomans throughout Europe. Determined to bring order to Greece, Mehmed decided that the destruction of the despotate and its full annexation directly into his empire was the only possible solution. The sultan assembled his army once more in April 1460 and led it in person first to Corinth and then on to Mystras. Although Demetrios had ostensibly been on the sultan's side, Mehmed invaded Demetrios's territory first. Demetrios surrendered to the Ottomans without a fight, fearing retribution and already having sent his family to safety in Monemvasia. Mystras thus fell into Ottoman hands on 29 May 1460, exactly seven years after Constantinople's fall. The few places in the Morea that dared resist the sultan's army were devastated as per Islamic law, the men being massacred and the women and children being taken away. As large numbers of Greek refugees escaped to Venetian-held territories such as Methoni and Koroni, the Morea was slowly subdued, the last resistance being led by Constantine Graitzas Palaiologos, a relative of Thomas and Demetrios, at Salmenikon in July 1461. = Life in exile = Saint Paul in front of the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Thomas served as the model of this statue in the 1460s.alt=left When Thomas had first heard of Mehmed's invasion, he had initially taken refuge at Mantineia to wait and see how the invasion unfolded. Once it became clear that the Ottomans were marching towards Leontari and would soon arrive outside Mantineia, Thomas, his entourage (including other Greek nobles, such as George Sphrantzes), his wife Catherine and his children Andreas, Manuel and Zoe fled to Methoni. Thomas and his companions fled to the island of Corfu on ships provided by Venice, arriving there on 22 July 1460. Although Catherine and the children stayed on Corfu, the island was only a temporary refuge for Thomas, and the local government was unwilling to allow him to stay for too long in fear of antagonizing the Ottomans. Thomas was unsure of where to travel to next, he attempted to travel to Ragusa, but the city's senate firmly rejected his arrival. Around the same time, Mehmed II sent messengers to Thomas to implore him to enter into a \\"treaty of friendship\\", promising him lands in return for his return to Greece. Unsure of what to do, Thomas sent emissaries to both Mehmed and the Papacy (to tell the Pope of his predicament). The envoy to Mehmed found the sultan at Veria and was, despite the sultan's words, immediately arrested and put in chains along with his entourage. A few days later the envoy was set free and returned to Thomas at Corfu with a message; either Thomas was to come to Mehmed in person, or he was to send some of his children. In light of this, Thomas decided that he had no choice; the West was his only option. On 16 November 1460, he left his wife and children behind on Corfu and set sail for Italy, landing in Ancona. In March 1461, Thomas arrived in Rome, where he hoped to convince Pope Pius II to call for a crusade. As the brother of the final Byzantine emperor, Thomas was the highest profile ruler in exile out of all the many Christians who escaped the Balkans over the course of the Ottoman conquest. Upon arriving in Rome, Thomas met with Pius II, who bestowed him with the Golden Rose, lodging in the Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia and a pension of 300 ducats each month (for a total of 3600 annually). In addition to the papal pension, Thomas also received an additional 200 ducats a month from the cardinals and 500 ducats from the Republic of Venice, which also begged him not to return to Corfu as to not affect Venice's already tenuous relations with the Ottomans. Thomas's many followers considered the money provided to him to be barely enough to support the despot, and certainly nowhere near enough to also support themselves. The Papacy recognized Thomas as the rightful Despot of the Morea and the true heir to the Byzantine Empire, though Thomas never claimed the imperial title. Pope Pius II's arrival at Ancona in 1464 by Pinturicchio; Thomas is the figure in the blue hat in the bottom left During his stay in Rome, Thomas, on account of his \\"tall and handsome appearance\\", served as the model of the statue of Saint Paul which to this day stands in front of the St. Peter's Basilica. On 12 April 1462, Thomas gave the supposed skull of Saint Andrew the Apostle, a precious relic which had been in Byzantine hands for centuries, to Pius II. Pius received the skull from Cardinal Bessarion at the Ponte Milvio. The ceremony, which was hailed as a return of Andrew to his relatives, the Romans (as symbolic descendants of Saint Peter) is depicted on Pius II's grave. In the 1460s, plans for a crusade against the Ottomans were once more underway. Pius II had made the recovery of Constantinople one of the primary goals of his pontificate and his 1459 council at Mantua had secured the promise of an army amounting to a total of 80,000 men from various of the great powers in Western Europe. Naval support for the plans was secured in 1463, when Venice formally declared war on the Ottomans as a result of Turkish incursions into their territories in Greece. In October 1463, Pius II formally declared war on the Ottoman Empire after Mehmed had refused his suggestion of converting to Christianity. While many of the Balkan exiles in the West were happy to live out their lives in obscurity, Thomas hoped to eventually restore control over Byzantine territory. As such, he staunchly supported the crusading plans. In early 1462, Thomas left to Rome to tour Italy and drum up support for a crusade, carrying with him papal letters of indulgence. Thomas brought with him letters by Pius II who described him as \\"a prince who was born to the illustrious and ancient family of the Palaiologoi ... a man who is now an immigrant, naked, robbed of everything except his lineage\\". Like his father Manuel II and his brother John VIII before him, Thomas's possessed a certain royal charisma and good looks, which ensured that his appeals did not fall on deaf ears. The Mantuan ambassador to Rome described him as \\"a handsome man with a fine, serious look about him and a noble and quite lordly bearing\\" and Milanese ambassadors who encountered him in Venice wrote that Thomas was \\"as dignified as any man on Earth can be\\". Of the many courts Thomas visited, serious objections to his appeal was made only by Venice, where the local senate made it clear that they wanted nothing to do with him. Not only did they make Thomas leave the city, but they sent ambassadors to Rome to request that he not accompany the expedition because his presence would \\"produce terrible and incongrous scandals\\". The reason for Venice's wrath against Thomas might be his advances on Venetian territories during his time as despot, or the fact that his quarreling with his brother Demetrios effectively doomed the Morean despotate. Despite Thomas's hopes, no expedition sat out for Greece. When the army was ready to set sail in 1464, Pius II travelled to Ancona to join the crusade, but died there on 15 August. Without Pius II's leadership, the crusade disbanded almost immediately, with all the ships returning home one by one. Upon the death of his wife in August 1462, Thomas summoned his children (who still remained at Corfu) to Rome, but they only arrived in the city after Thomas had died on 12 May 1465. Though Thomas had been largely bypassed and forgotten by the Roman elite after Pius II's death in 1464, he was buried with honor in the St. Peter's Basilica, where his grave would survive the destruction and removal of the tombs of the Palaiologan emperors in Constantinople during the early years of Ottoman rule. Modern efforts to locate his grave within the Basilica have so far proven fruitless.  Children and descendants  Forensical reconstruction of Ivan the Terrible, Russia's first Tsar from 1547 to 1584. Thomas Palaiologos was Ivan's great- grandfather through his daughter Zoe (Sophia) Palaiologina. Blood ties to Byzantine royalty allowed Russia to strengthen its claim to being the \\"Third Rome\\". It is generally accepted that Thomas had four children with Catherine Zaccaria. These four children were: * Helena Palaiologina (1431 ‚Äì 7 November 1473), the older of the couple's two daughters, Helena was married to Lazar Brankoviƒá, a son of ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, Despot of Serbia. By the time of the Morea's fall, Helena had long since moved to Smederevo with her husband (who eventually became the Despot of Serbia in 1456). Lazar died in 1458 and Helena was left to care for the couple's three daughters. In 1459, Mehmed II invaded Serbia and put an end to the despotate, but Helena was allowed to leave the country. After spending some time in Ragusa, she moved to Corfu and lived there with her mother and siblings. After that, Helena became a nun and lived on the island of Lefkada, where she died in November 1473. Though Helena had many descendants through her three daughters Jelena, Milica and Jerina Brankovic, none of them carried on the Palaiologos name. * Zoe Palaiologina ( 1449 ‚Äì 7 April 1503), the younger daughter of Thomas and Catherine, Zoe was married off to Ivan III, Grand Prince of Moscow, by Pope Sixtus IV in 1472, in the hope of converting the Russians to Roman Catholicism. The Russians did not convert, with the marriage being celebrated according to Eastern Orthodox tradition. Zoe was called \\"Sophia\\" in Russia and her marriage to Ivan III served to strengthen Moscow's claim to be the \\"Third Rome\\", the ideological and spiritual successor to the Byzantine Empire. Zoe and Ivan III had several children, who in turn had numerous descendants and though none carried the Palaiologos name, many of them used the double-headed eagle iconography of Byzantium. The famous Ivan the Terrible, Russia's first Tsar, was Sophia's grandson. *Andreas Palaiologos (17 January 1453 ‚Äì June 1502), the older of the couple's two sons and the third child overall, Andreas lived most of his life in Rome, surviving on a gradually declining papal pension. After Thomas's death, Andreas was recognized by the Papacy and others in Italy as the rightful heir to the Despotate of the Morea and he would later go on to claim the title Imperator Constantinopolitanus (\\"Emperor of Constantinople\\") as well, hoping to one day restore the fallen Byzantine Empire. He attempted to organize an expedition to restore the empire in 1481, but his plans failed and he later ceded the rights to the imperial title to Charles VIII of France, hoping to use him as a champion against the Turks. Andreas died poor in Rome, whether or not he had any children is uncertain. His will specified that his titles were to be granted to the Catholic Monarchs in Spain (though they never used them). * Manuel Palaiologos (2 January 1455 ‚Äì before 1512), the youngest of the four children, Manuel lived in Rome and lived off Papal money, much the same as his brother. As the pension deteriorated and Manuel (as second-in- line) did not have any titles to sell, he instead travelled Europe in search of someone to hire him in a military capacity. Failing to find satisfactory offers, Manuel surprised everyone else involved by travelling to Constantinople in 1476 and throwing himself on the mercy of Sultan Mehmed II, who graciously received him. He married an unknown woman and stayed in Constantinople for the rest of his life. Manuel had two sons, one of which died young and another which converted to Islam and whose eventual fate is uncertain. In the late 16th century, a family with the last name Paleologus, living in Pesaro in Italy, claimed descent from Thomas through a supposed third son, called John. This family later mainly lived in Cornwall and contained figures such as Theodore Paleologus, who worked as a soldier and hired assassin, and Ferdinand Paleologus, who retired in Barbados in the late 17th century. The existence of a son of Thomas called John cannot be proven with any certainty as no mention is made of a son by that name in contemporary records. It is possible that John was a real historical figure, possibly an illegitimate son of Thomas, or perhaps his grandson through of either of his known sons, Andreas or Manuel. Some later Italian genealogies dating to the 17th century and onwards give Thomas two more sons; a bastard son named Rogerio and a fourth legitimate son, also named Thomas. The existence of Rogerio and Thomas the Younger is overwhelmingly dismissed as fantasy in modern scholarship.

Being from a small university town Lindeberg witnessed the energy of student protests and rebellion, which he would draw inspiration from for the rest of his career. He is the founder of J.Lindeberg (where he is currently creative director), Paris68, and BLK DNM. He has previously worked with Hans Brindfors Annonsbyra ad agency, Diesel, William Rast, and Absolut. Johan met his wife Marcella Lindeberg while working at Diesel. Together they have a daughter, Blue Lindeberg, who is a model. Early life Johan Lindeberg attended college in Boston, Massachusetts. He was initially a travelling businessman trading wood chips showcasing his entrepreneurial spirit. However, he felt that business was not the career path for him and pursued fashion design as he was inspired by his sister who was also a designer.  Diesel  Johan Lindeberg's career started in the late 1980s as managing director of one of the top ad agencies at the time, Hans Brindfors Annonsbyra. Without any retail experience, he sought the proper distribution and increased Diesel's sales in Sweden from 1,000 to 200,000 pairs of jeans. He was then asked by the founder of Diesel, Renzo Rosso, himself to be the International Marketing Director in 1992. Lindeberg was able to leave an everlasting impact as the $17.5 million campaign he created is still used today by the brand. The \\"For Successful Living\\" campaign was based on the fashion industry concept that the right jeans or sports shoes will change a person's life. In fall of 1994 Diesel won the Grand Prix at the Nordic Advertising Festival for a spot showing a monster emerging chasing a screaming girl who leads him into a trap with a big net. The spot ends with a meat grinder and grilled monster burgers. Lindeberg went on to become CEO of Diesel US but resigned from his duties due to fatigue from constantly restraining his own visions  J.Lindeberg  Johan Lindeberg founded the J.Lindeberg brand in 1996. Whilst traveling through Europe on his motorcycle he visualized a fashion brand that reflected his personal and creative values as just as much as his own identity. A brand that Johan himself would love to wear, a brand he couldn't find anywhere else. Johan launched his brand during the summer of 1996 in Stockholm and New York simultaneously. The brand was named J.Lindeberg after Johan's own signature style and together with a number of investors the company was born, Johan himself committing all his financial resources in the start up. Two parallel offices where assembled, one in Stockholm's port district and one on 57th street Manhattan in New York City, as the brand would be international from the start. With himself as Creative Director, Johan assembled a small team of designers headed by Roland Hjort who was recruited from the Swedish apparel brand H&M.; Johan was able to change the golfing fashion landscape when he dressed Jesper Parnevik in vibrant pink pants. It was something the golf world hadn't seen before and established Parnevik as a style icon of golf. Lindeberg is also credited with making skinny tailored suits before it became a trend. His uniqueness and attention to detail is featured throughout J.Lindeberg. The brand has been featured on red carpets for award shows and premieres being worn by celebrities such as Ashton Kutcher, Zac Efron, Brad Pitt, and Scott Piercy.  Paris68  As Johan and his wife Marcella relocated to New York City, they started a high end brand consulting agency in 2007. The company was called Paris68 paying homage to the student revolution carried on in the French capital in May 1968.  William Rast  When Johan received a call from Reinard Hasse, the German importer for William Rast, he was initially uninterested as he had J.Lindeberg and Paris68 to work on. It wasn't until he met the founder, Justin Timberlake, who was also a fan of J.Lindeberg that he was on board. Lindeberg and Marcella became Creative Directors of the brand where Johan was overseeing the menswear division and his wife running the women's division. They had a vision to create something that combined both the modernity and coolness of Hollywood and the rough roots of Tennessee. William Rast is a cross culture linking glamour influences and the spirit of Justin's roots. Lindeberg and Timberlake worked very closely and got along so well that he became Timberlake's personal stylist.  Departure  Up until 2007 Johan was respectively juggling three projects: J.Lindeberg, Paris68, and William Rast. However, due to pressure from investors, Johan felt creatively blocked and left J.Lindeberg 2007 and William Rast in 2009.  BLK DNM  In 2010 Johan Lindeberg started a new project under the Kellwood Company, BLK DNM with their first collection launching in February 2011. BLK DNM was a project that was established at a difficult time in Johan's life as he and Marcella separated. Lindeberg was determined to find himself and channel his negative energy into something creative. He based the brand on his staple wardrobe items which were his signature leather jacket and black denim jeans. BLK DNM was sold exclusively online and to select amount of retailers in order to cut the middleman to avoid excessive mark ups and offer accessible retail pricing. The brand is known for its chic simplistic look that can easily be dressed up or worn casually. It has been featured on magazine covers, worn by celebrities such as Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Kardashian, and Jay Z and Beyonce for their Run The World Tour. On May 2015 it was publicized that Johan Lindeberg would be leaving BLK DNM to focus on personal projects.  Photography  Johan also discovered his passion for photography as an outlet to communicate and express himself when he was shooting street posters for BLK DNM. He picked up the camera for the first time in August 2011 and has since worked with renowned models, Gisele B√ºndchen, Kenza Fourati, Anja Rubik, and Arizona Muse. His goal has always been to capture the person and who they are, not their model persona. Lindeberg's subject for photography has grown and expanded as he traveled to India with his daughter to document the women of Nepal following the earthquake in 2015. In November 2015 Mazdack Rassi of Milk Studios hosted Lindeberg's gallery as an exhibition and won an award. Johan Lindeberg has a personal website where all of his photography can be seen.  Absolut Elyx  In 2013 Johan Lindeberg took on a new project as creative director for the Absolut's new luxury vodka, Absolut Elyx. There he focused on positioning, strategy, and creative direction. He conceived and photographed brand's launch campaign series featuring Chloe Sevigny, Adriana Varej√£o and Charlotte Gainsbourg. One of the most notable details of the campaign was Lindeberg's ability to capture the brand ambassadors in raw industrial spaces giving them a new edge.  Return to J.Lindeberg  In 2015 it was announced that Johan Lindeberg would return to his namesake brand after 10 years apart as creative director. After discussions with a J.Lindeberg co-owner and being persuaded by his daughter, he decided to return to the first brand he ever created. He plans on re-envisioning the voice and lifestyle of the brand with plans to launch a special collection for the 20th anniversary in 2017. Another special project Johan has planned is The Bridge Series launching August 2016 featuring a variety of individuals, who get the chance to express something meaningful and unique to them. Promotional efforts include a magazine, and street posters.

The shelter was used in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War and the Persian Gulf War by hundreds of civilians. According to the U.S. military, the shelter at Amiriyah had been targeted because it fit the profile of a military command center; electronic signals from the locality had been reported as coming from the site, and spy satellites had observed people and vehicles moving in and out of the shelter. Background The United States was responsible for the decision to target the Amiriyah shelter. By its own admission, the U.S. Department of Defense \\"knew the Ameriyya facility had been used as a civil-defense shelter during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War\\". Changes in the protected status of such a facility require warning, and Human Rights Watch notes that, \\"The United States' failure to give such a warning before proceeding with the disastrous attack on the Ameriyya shelter was a serious violation of the laws of war\\".Human Rights Watch, Needless Deaths In The Gulf War: Civilian Casualties During the Air Campaign and Violations of the Laws of War, 1991. Charles E. Allen, the CIA's National Intelligence Officer for Warning, supported the selection of bomb targets during the Persian Gulf War. He coordinated intelligence with Colonel John Warden, who headed the U.S. Air Force's planning cell known as \\"Checkmate\\". On 10 February 1991, Allen presented his estimate to Colonel Warden that Public Shelter Number 25 in the southwestern Baghdad suburb of Amiriyah had become an alternative command post and showed no sign of being used as a civilian bomb shelter.Crusade: The Untold Story of the Persian Gulf War, Rick Atkinson, 1993, pp. 284‚Äì285. However, Human Rights Watch noted in 1991, \\"It is now well established, through interviews with neighborhood residents, that the Ameriyya structure was plainly marked as a public shelter and was used throughout the air war by large numbers of civilians\\". A former American air force general who worked as \\"the senior targeting officer for the Royal Saudi Air Force\\", an \\"impeccable\\" source according to Robert Fisk, said in the aftermath of the bombing that \\"[Richard I.] Neal talked about camouflage on the roof of the bunker. But I am not of the belief that any of the bunkers around Baghdad have camouflage on them. There is said to have been barbed wire there but that's normal in Baghdad... There's not a single soul in the American military who believes that this was a command-and-control bunker... We thought it was a military personnel bunker. Any military bunker is assumed to have some civilians in it. We have attacked bunkers where we assume there are women and children who are members of the families of military personnel who are allowed in the military bunkers\\". Satellite photos and electronic intercepts indicating this alternative use as a command and control center were regarded as circumstantial and unconvincing to Brigadier General Buster Glosson, who had primary responsibility for targeting. Glosson's comment was that the assessment wasn't \\"worth a shit\\". On 11 February, Shelter Number 25 was added to the U.S. Air Force's attack plan. Bombing At 04:30 on the morning of 13 February, two F-117 stealth bombers each dropped a 2,000 pound GBU-27 laser-guided bomb on the shelter. The first cut through ten feet of reinforced concrete before a time-delayed fuse exploded. Minutes later the second bomb followed the path cut by the first bomb. People staying in the upper level were incinerated by heat, while boiling water from the shelter's water tank was responsible for the rest of the fatalities.Felicity Arbuthnot, , 13 February 2007. At the time of the bombing, hundreds of Iraqi civilians were sheltering in the building. More than 400 people were killed; reports on precise numbers vary and the registration book was incinerated in the blast. The blast sent shrapnel into surrounding buildings, shattering glass windows and splintering their foundations. The shelter is maintained as a memorial to those who died within it, featuring photos of those killed. Not all who died died immediately; black, incinerated hands of some victims remain fused to the concrete ceiling of the shelter. According to visitors' reports, Umm Greyda, a woman who lost eight children in the bombing, moved into the shelter to help create the memorial, and serves as its primary guide.John Dear, S. J., Iraq Journal: Notes from a peace delegation to a ravaged land, Sojourners Magazine, 1999.Riverbend, Dedicated to the Memory of L.A.S., 15 February 2004. Reactions A number of foreign governments responded to the mass killing at Amiriyah with mourning, outrage, and calls for investigations. Jordan declared three days of mourning. Algerian and Sudanese governing parties condemned a \\"paroxysm of terror and barbarism\\" and a \\"hideous, bloody massacre\\" respectively. Jordan and Spain called for an international inquiry into the bombing, and Spain urged the U.S. to move its attacks away from Iraq itself, and concentrate instead on occupied Kuwait.

BICS refers primarily to context-bound, face-to-face communication, like the language first learned by toddlers and preschoolers, which is used in everyday social interaction. This term is often credited to Jim Cummins' research related to language acquisition and learning. The other term that is often used in conjunction with this term is cognitive academic language proficiency (CALP). CALP refers to the highly abstract, decontextualized communication that takes place in the classroom, especially in the later elementary grades. CALP involves the ‚Äúlanguage of learning,‚Äù which enables children to problem- solve, hypothesize, imagine, reason and project into situations with which they have no personal experience. It is a prerequisite for learning to read and write and for overall academic success. The implications of the BICS and CALP concepts for children are that the second language or language of the classroom needs to be sufficiently well developed for her or him to be able to meet the cognitive demands of the academic setting. Students typically are thought to acquire BICS in 2‚Äì3 years but take 5‚Äì7 years to develop the CALP needed to be on the same level with their native speaking counterparts in the classroom. Although the terms BICS and CALP are still widely used, Cummins has more recently used the terms conversational language and \\"academic language.\\"Echevarria, Jana. (2007).

It is a spin-off publication from the popular British adult comic Viz and features one of the comic's characters, the foul-mouthed Roger Mellie \\"the Man on the Telly\\". The title of the book is a word play on Roget's Thesaurus, Profanisaurus being a portmanteau of profanity and Thesaurus. The book is marketed as \\"the foulest-mouthed book ever to stalk the face of the earth\\". Publication The Profanisaurus was originally published as a supplement stapled into the middle of the December 1997 edition of the Viz comic (Viz 87), with 'over 700 rude words and phrases'. Contributions from readers were originally published in the comic and then edited into later editions. The first actual book was released less than a year later, in 1998 (), but the content had tripled with now 2,250 definitions; this was followed in the second edition in 2002 with the number of terms covered growing to 4,000 (). An updated version, the Profanisaurus Rex, containing over 8,000 words and phrases, was released in 2005, and a further-expanded version, the \\"Magna Farta\\" (a play on Magna Carta) at the end of 2007. (Perhaps coincidentally, Oliver Cromwell is said to have referred to Magna Carta as \\"Magna Farta\\".) Subsequent versions have been Das Krapital (2010, a play on Karl Marx's Das Kapital), Hail Sweary (2013, featuring on the cover Roger in a monk's outfit kneeling as if in prayer, and the title in Olde Englishe above; an obvious and obscene reference to the Catholic 'Hail Mary'), and War and Piss (2018, a play on Tolstoy's War and Peace, with \\"over 20,000\\" definitions). Unlike a traditional dictionary or thesaurus the content is enlivened by often pungent or politically incorrect observations and asides intended to provide further comic effect. Those familiar with Ambrose Bierce's Devil's Dictionary might recognise some parallels with Bierce's style though his lacked the overt obscenity. The authors often take delight in lampooning political or media figures of the day, or illustrating terms with fictional dialogue between notionally respectable historical figures. A much-used technique for sexual phrases is to include them in a quoted passage from a non-existent Barbara Cartland novel. Reception David Stubbs wrote that Profanisaurus \\"represents what you might call the maximalist tendency in obscenity\\". Becky Barrow wrote that Profanisaurus \\"became a bestseller.

It was founded by the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century. Some ruins of their Grobina castle are still visible. The town was given its charter in 1695. During the Early Middle Ages, Grobi≈Üa (or Grobin) was the most important political centre on the territory of Latvia. There was a centre of Scandinavian settlement on the Baltic Sea, comparable in many ways to Hedeby and Birka but probably predating them both. About 3,000 surviving burial mounds contain the most impressive remains of the Vendel Age in Northern Europe. Scandinavian settlement The settlement pre-dates the Viking Age, but was apparently used as a place of passage by Vikings from the early 9th century.Robert Ferguson, The Hammer and the Cross: A new history of the Vikings (2009), pp. 110-111. =Site= The settlement at Grobin was excavated by Birger Nerman in 1929 and 1930. Nerman found remains of an earthwork stronghold, which had been protected on three sides by the ƒÄlande River. Three Vendel Age cemeteries may be dated to the period between 650 and 800 AD. One of them was military in character and analogous to similar cemeteries in the M√§laren Valley in Central Sweden, while two others indicate that there was \\"a community of Gotlanders who were carrying on peaceful pursuits behind the shield of the Swedish military\\".Francis Donald Logan. The Vikings in History (Routledge 1992), page 182. From Nerman's findings, it appears that Grobin was the site of an early Scandinavian colony from Gotland. Many of the graves in level ground were of women, who could be identified as natives of Gotland by their belt-buckles and brooches. The grave-mounds predominantly housed men, often accompanied by typical Scandinavian weaponry.Robert Ferguson, The Hammer and the Cross: A new history of the Vikings (2009), pp. 110-111. In one grave a picture-stone or stele depicting two duck-like birds was found in 1987. Such picture-stones are otherwise unique to Gotland. From its style it can be dated to the second half of 7th century. The weathered surface of one side contains refined carvings - inside the ring of ornaments there are two waterbirds; their beaks meet. Several hundreds of such picture stones () have been found in Gotland.Priediens Scandinavian barrow cemetery In the early years of the 9th century female graves at Grobin become scarce. Later graves are those of seafaring Scandinavian males.Robert Ferguson, The Hammer and the Cross: A new history of the Vikings (2009), page 111. =Destruction = The Norsemen may have remained in control of Grobin until the mid-9th century, when ‚Äî as Rimbert's Vita Ansgari relates ‚Äî people inhabiting the Courland regions of Latvia rebelled after a long period as tributaries of Swedish rulers. In about 854 a fleet of Danes attempted to reimpose the tribute on their own behalf, but was defeated. Then Olof (I) of Sweden gathered an enormous army and tried to win back the former colony, in the process destroying a place that Rimbert calls Seeburg, usually identified as Grobin. Seeburg had 7,000 armed men to protect it, but the town was pillaged, ravaged, and burnt by the Swedes. The invaders sent back their ships and started out on a five-day expedition into the hinterland. They reached the town of Apulia (modern Apuolƒó, to the southeast, in Lithuania) which had as many as 15,000 warriors. The town was besieged for eight days without apparent success and the Norsemen even appealed to the Christian God for help. When they were preparing for a decisive battle, the Curonians suddenly sued for peace, giving as booty weapons and gold captured by them from the Danes a year earlier.Rimbert: Life of Anskar, the Apostle of the North, 801-865, chapter 30. Nerman's excavations at the ancient fort of Apulia corroborated the account of Vita Ansgari. He found evidence of a large-scale conflict in the 9th century, notably large concentrations of Swedish arrowheads near the walls of the derelict Curonian fortress.

A cover charge is an entrance fee sometimes charged at bars, nightclubs, or restaurants. The American Heritage Dictionary defines it as a \\"fixed amount added to the bill at a nightclub or restaurant for entertainment or service.\\"Cover charge. The American Heritage¬Æ Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ¬©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company. In restaurants, cover charges (or \\"couvert\\" charges) generally do not include the cost of food that is specifically ordered, but in some establishments, they do include the cost of bread, butter, olives and other accompaniments which are provided as a matter of course. Etymology When a group of people sit at a table in a restaurant, some restaurants will charge a fee even for a guest who does not order any food; this charge is for the service of setting out the tablecloth, napkin, and cutlery. The Oxford English Dictionary defines a \\"cover charge\\" as \\"a charge for service added to the basic charge in a restaurant\\".OED entry for \\"cover charge\\" Such a charge is made in many countries, usually described by the word equivalent to \\"cover\\" (couvert, coperto,Example of use of coperto in Italian cubierto,From Concise Oxford Spanish dictionary: cubierto (2) (in restaurant) - cover charge etc.). A place-setting at a restaurant, in English and in other languages, is often referred to as \\"a cover\\"OED , meaning 7 of \\"cover\\": \\"The utensils laid for each person's use at table; the plate, napkin, knife, fork, spoon, etc.\\"N. Newnham-Davis, Dinners & Diners, 1899. ch. 1, collected from an earlier article in the Pall Mall Gazette \\"This is the menu for a dinner of six covers, a very admirable dinner\\" or equivalent term in other languages. A term sometimes used in the US is \\"table charge\\". The charge is typically a few US dollars or equivalent.Restaurants included in the toptable.com website, mainly in the UK, which levy a cover charge between one and ten pounds sterling, about US$1.50 to $15 Although the charge is often said to be for bread, butter, olives, etc. taken to the table, it is payable whether or not they are eaten. Restaurants in English-speaking countries sometimes have a menu in French; in these and other restaurants the cover charge is sometimes described with the French word \\"couvert\\". This term and the related charge, originating in France, has been used with this meaning in English since at least 1899.N. Newnham-Davis, Dinners & Diners, 1899. ch. 1, collected from an earlier article in the Pall Mall Gazette \\"And the bill ... three couverts, 3s.; caviar, 3s., ...\\" The French word both means table setting and is the past participle of couvrir, \\"to cover\\";\\"Couvert\\" in Larousse French dictionary couvert or \\"cover\\" in the sense of place-setting derived from the French past participle according to the OED: \\"Cover (7): After French couvert, (1) ‚Äòthe covering or furniture of a Table for the meale of a prince‚Äô (Cotgrave), the cloth, plates, knives, forks, etc. with which a table is covered or laid; (2) the portion of these appropriated to each guest\\". History The couvert or cover charge has been levied for many years, certainly in English-speaking countries by 1899. In the US the cover charge later became an entry charge where both entertainment and food and drink are provided, and carries the expectation of entertainment. The first such cover charge was introduced in 1913 by Louis Fischer at Reisenweber's Cafe in Manhattan,John Reisenweber's 1931 obituary in the Brooklyn Standard Union. \\"Reisenweber's was the first to initiate dancing for its patrons and was instrumental in introducing the modern cabaret. They also installed the modern \\"cover charge\\" in 1913, when the fee for witnessing their elaborate entertainment specialties was twenty-five cents, an exorbitant sum at that time.\\" to cover the production costs of Ned Wayburn's revues held there. \\"To pay for Ned Wayburn's lavish revues in the Paradise Room, Reisenweber's imposed New York's first cover charge, a whopping twenty-five cents.\\" In most countries where restaurant cover charges are made the practice is far from universal; many restaurants make no charge. Tourist destinations may be more likely to make this charge, which unwary visitors may not anticipate. Tips are usually much lower internationally than the 15-20% typical in restaurants in the USA without cover charge; the total outlay for the meal including tip is not necessarily higher. The term \\"cover charge\\" is used in other cases, and can be confusing. A practice, sometimes called a cover charge in the USA is to make a flat charge for unlimited food. Restaurants may make a charge to diners who book but fail to show up; this is occasionally called a cover charge. Legal restrictions According to Massachusetts law, subject to a penalty of up to $50, no cafe, restaurant, or bar can require payment of a minimum or cover charge unless a sign is conspicuously posted with at least one-inch-high letters, stating that a minimum charge or cover charge shall be charged and indicating the amount. Children under thirteen may not be charged.ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT TITLE XX. PUBLIC SAFETY AND GOOD ORDER CHAPTER 140. LICENSES THEATRICAL EXHIBITIONS, PUBLIC AMUSEMENTS, ETC. Chapter 140: Section 183D. Minimum or cover charge Section 183D. No innholder, common victualler or person owning, managing or controlling a cafe, restaurant, or other eating or drinking establishment shall require any person to pay a minimum charge or cover charge unless a sign is conspicuously posted at every entrance to any dining room or rooms where such charge is required, in letters no less than one inch in height, stating that a minimum charge or cover charge shall be charged and also stating the amount of charge; provided, however, that no such innholder, common victualler or person owning, managing or controlling a cafe, restaurant or other eating or drinking establishment shall require a person under thirteen years of age to pay a minimum charge or cover charge. Whoever violates this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than fifty dollars. https://web.archive.org/web/20060611225425/http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/140-183d.htm This law was put in place to resolve the problem of ‚Äúsecret‚Äù cover charges, which are indicated only in tiny text on the menu. Clubgoers would then find this cover charge added to their first drink order. In Illinois, bars cannot impose a cover charge unless the fee goes towards the cost of off-setting entertainment costs such as a live band. In 1995, the Italian regional government in Lazio (which includes Rome) began requiring restaurants in the region to remove the cover charge for \\"Pane e coperto\\" (bread and cover) from their bills. In 1998, the European Union ruled that the regional law was invalid, but the region is continuing to try to abolish the practice19/07/2006 - No more \\"Pane e coperto\\"? https://www.inforoma.it/news.php Business models Bars often impose a cover charge for the expense of paying entertainers, such as DJs. =Cover charges= Bars and clubs that use cover charges use them for several reasons. In some cases, popular bars and clubs have a substantial excess demand; patrons are lined up outside the club waiting to get in. In this case, the club can gain additional revenue from customers by requiring an entrance charge. Other bars and clubs use cover charges only on nights when there is live entertainment or a DJ, to cover the costs of hiring the performers. Cover charges are usually much lower for local, semi-professional bands or entertainers than for better-known touring bands from other regions. In North America, the cover charge for a performance by a local teenage band may be as low as a few dollars; a show by a nationally-known band with a recording contract may have a $10 to $15 cover. Some expensive jazz clubs and comedy clubs have both a cover charge and a minimum drink requirement. Many sports bars have cover charge when they are showing a boxing or a UFC pay per view event, to help defray to costs of ordering the pay-per-view material. =Price discrimination= In economics, the term \\"price discrimination\\" refers to charging different prices to different customers, based on the anticipated elasticity of demand of different customers. Bars often offer student discounts because university or college students will have a different willingness to pay than an average consumer, due to their budget constraints. Thus, the bar sets a lower price for entry for university and college students because students have elastic demand. In some bars there are different cover charges for legal drinking-age customers and for minors who may not purchase or drink alcohol (e.g., a $5 cover charge for those over 21 and an $8 cover for minors). Some bars have lower cover charges for some categories, such as college or university students with student identification; some have lower cover charges for members of the club or of nightclub organizations or associations. Cover charge is waived at some clubs for early arrivals (before 11 p.m. or midnight), for people who order food, or, if the club is in a hotel, for hotel guests. Some bars customarily or occasionally waive the cover charge for women in hopes that doing so will increase their number of female customers and thereby attract male customers as well. The bar usually allows the band or performers to provide a list of guests who will be admitted without paying the cover charge (\\"the guest list\\"). The bouncer may waive the cover charge for some customers, such as regular customers who usually purchase a large number of drinks. As well, bouncers sometimes waive the cover charge for their friends, in what could be described as nepotism or even as an illegal action akin to theft or embezzlement that deprives the bouncer's employer of revenue to which it is entitled. =Revenue-sharing with performers= Bars and clubs have different policies for how the cover charge is shared, if at all, with the performers. Different revenue-sharing agreements are often negotiated by different performers. The range of revenue-sharing arrangements range from the band or performers retaining all of the money collected for the cover charge, to a split between the bar and the band, to arrangements where the bar retains all of the cover charge. A variant of these revenue-sharing arrangements occurs in cases where the bar also gives the band a share of the bar's alcohol sales receipts. Some bars may also agree to a guarantee, in which the bar promises to pay the band a certain amount even if this is less than the amount collected at the door. =Luxury cover charges= Luxury clubs with unusual architecture and interior design and a unique atmosphere sometimes have cover charges even when there is no live entertainment or DJ. In these cases, the cover charge simply contributes to the club's profits. For example, Mike Viscuso‚Äôs On Broadway, a glam-disco dining palace, has a cover charge of $15. James Brennan‚Äôs Stingaree, a glam restaurant and club/lounge, has a cover charge of $20. https://web.archive.org/web/20051218054433/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20051215/news_1w15night1.html Some high-end and luxury bars and nightclubs have yearly membership fees which can be interpreted as annual cover charges. For example, Frederick's has a $1,200 a year membership, the Keating Lounge has a $2,500 annual membership fee, and The Core Club has a $60,000 membership fee. A variant of these annual fees are \\"table charges\\" at some elite nightclubs, in which a customer agrees to spend a minimum amount in order to reserve a table in the club (e.g., $1000 in the evening). =No cover charge= Some bars and clubs do not charge an entrance fee, which is indicated in signs stating \\"no cover\\" or \\"no cover charge\\". These bars use the live entertainers to draw and retain customers in the establishment, so that the customers will buy drinks. To attract more female customers, bars often have a ‚Äúno cover for women‚Äù policy, sometimes on a ladies' night. In some cases these policies have been challenged in lawsuits as discriminatory, and are illegal in some jurisdictions in the United States. A ladies' night is a promotional event, often at a bar or nightclub, where female patrons pay less than male patrons for the cover charge or drinks. State courts in California, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have ruled that ladies' night discounts are unlawful gender discrimination under state or local statutes. However, courts in Illinois, Minnesota, and Washington have rejected a variety of challenges to such discounts. Claims against ladies' nights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution have failed under the state action doctrine.Hollander v. Swindells-Donovan, 2010 WL 844588 (E.D.N.Y. 2010). Similar actions have failed under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983).Hollander v. Copacabana Nightclub, 580 F.Supp.2d 335 (S.D.N.Y. 2008).Comiskey v. JFTJ Corp., 989 F.2d 1007 (8th Cir. 1983). Ladies nights' may have federal tax implications, though.U.S. v. Covey Gas & Oil, 171 F.2d 213 (10th Cir. 1949). Federal claims were also involved in the unsuccessful challenge in Washington (see below). California The California Supreme Court has ruled that ladies' days at a car wash and ladies' nights at a nightclub violate California's Unruh Civil Rights Act in Koire v Metro Car Wash (1985)Koire v Metro Car Wash, 707 P.2d 195 (CA 1985). and Angelucci v. Century Supper Club (2007).Angelucci v. Century Supper Club, 158 P.3d 718 (CA 2007). The Unruh Act provides: \\"All persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex [...] are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever [...].\\" The court considered the statutory defense that the promotions serve \\"substantial business and social purposes\\", but concluded that merely being profitable is not a sufficient defense. The court accused the Wisconsin Supreme Court of \\"sexual stereotyping\\" for upholding a similar practice. Koire held that: \\"Public policy in California strongly supports eradication of discrimination based on sex. The Unruh Act expressly prohibits sex discrimination by business enterprises.\\" Koire concluded: :\\"The legality of sex-based price discounts cannot depend on the subjective value judgments about which types of sex-based distinctions are important or harmful. The express language of the Unruh Act provides a clear and objective standard by which to determine the legality of the practices at issue. The Legislature has clearly stated that business establishments must provide \\"equal . . . advantages . . . [and] privileges\\" to all customers \\"no matter what their sex.\\" (¬ß 51.) Strong public policy supports application of the Act in this case. The defendants have advanced no convincing argument that this court should carve out a judicial exception for their sex-based price discounts. The straightforward proscription of the Act should be respected.\\" Subsequent to the decision, California passed the Gender Tax Repeal Act of 1995, which specifically prohibits differential pricing based solely on a customer's gender.Eric D. Hone and Franchesca Van Buren, \\"Is the Death Knell Ringing for Ladies' Nights?\\" Nevada Lawyer (March 2009). In Angelucci, the California Supreme Court ruled that discrimination victims did not have to ask the offending business to be treated equally in order to have standing to file an Unruh Act or Gender Tax Repeal Act claim. Courts have not found violations on the Unruh Act with discounts for which any customer could theoretically qualify for.Starkman v. Mann Theatres Corp., 227 Cal.App.3d 1491 (1991). The California Supreme Court opined: :\\"A multitude of promotional discounts come to mind which are clearly permissible under the Unruh Act. For example, a business establishment might offer reduced rates to all customers on one day each week. Or, a business might offer a discount to any customer who meets a condition which any patron could satisfy (e.g., presenting a coupon, or sporting a certain color shirt or a particular bumper sticker). In addition, nothing prevents a business from offering discounts for purchasing commodities in quantity, or for making advance reservations. The key is that the discounts must be ‚Äúapplicable alike to persons of every sex, color, race, [etc.]‚Äù ( ¬ß 51), instead of being contingent on some arbitrary, class-based generalization.\\" The Koire precedent has not been extended to strike down Mother's Day promotions.Cohn v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc., 169 Cal.App.4th 523 (2008). Koire was one of the precedents cited in the lower court (but not the state Supreme Court) in In re Marriage Cases which was overturned by California Proposition 8 (2008).In re Marriage Cases, 49 Cal.Rptr.3d 675 (2006). Illinois Ladies' nights in Illinois have been upheld under the anti-discrimination provision of the Dram Shop Act.Dock Club, Inc. v. Illinois Liquor Control Commission, 404 N.E.2d 1050 (Ill. App. 1980). The court determined that the discount was intended to encourage women to attend the bar in greater numbers, rather than to discourage attendance by males.John E. Theuman, \\"Exclusion of one sex from admission to or enjoyment of equal privileges in places of accommodation or entertainment as actionable sex discrimination under state law\\" 38 A.L.R.4th 339 (1985). Maryland Montgomery County's human relations law has been interpreted to not only prohibit ladies' nights, but also a \\"Skirt and Gown Night\\" where a customer is given a 50% discount for wearing a skirt or gown.Peppin v. Woodside Delicatessen, 506 A.2d 263 (MD App. 1986). The court noted that: \\"Against this superficially humorous backdrop, we must decide whether this seemingly innocuous business practice constitutes unlawful discrimination within the meaning of a county ordinance.\\" The Montgomery County Code, Human Relations Law, ¬ß 27-9, prohibited: :\\"[...] any distinction with respect to any person based on race, color, sex, marital status, religious creed, ancestry, national origin, handicap, or sexual orientation in connection with admission to, service or sales in, or price, quality or use of any facility or service of any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement in the county.\\" The Maryland's appellate court's review was far from de novo and the court emphasized that: :\\"Although we believe the judge's findings to be contradicted by American cultural realities, we need not focus on the circuit court's determination; our review is that of the agency's conclusion based upon facts presented at the hearing. The record is replete with evidence that Skirt and Gown Night was intended to-and did-have the same effect and serve the same function as Ladies' Night, i.e. it provided price discounts to women and, in fact, operated as a mere extension of Ladies' Night.\\" The court also stressed the peculiarity and strictness of the municipal ordinance it was interpreting: :\\"We believe the ordinance is unambiguous.

App. 2009). In June 2010 the Minnesota Department of Human Rights said bars are discriminating against males by holding \\"ladies' night\\" promotions, but said it will not seek out bars that have a \\"ladies night.\\" Nevada Although this question has not been litigated in Nevada, two Nevada attorneys advise: \\"for the time being, businesses should exercise caution in utilizing gender-based pricing scheme promotions. While the ability of a plaintiff to succeed on such a claim in district court remains unknown, NERC has the ability to pursue such claims on the administrative level. Therefore, businesses should engage in a cost-benefit analysis, keeping in mind that they might have to spend time and resources defending a sex discrimination charge in front of NERC or elsewhere.\\" New York The New York State Human Rights Appeal Board disapproved of a New York Yankees \\"Ladies Day\\" promotion, which originated in 1876 as being \\"in a modern technological society where women and men are to be on equal footing as a matter of public policy.\\"Abosh v. New York Yankees, Inc. (1972) No. CPS-25284, Appeal No. 1194. Pennsylvania Such promotions violate the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act as unlawful gender discrimination where male patrons are charged an entrance fee or a greater charge for drinks and female patrons are not charged an identical entrance fee or the same charge for drinks as male patrons. In Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board v. Dobrinoff, the Commonwealth Court specifically found that where a female patron was exempt from a cover charge, a go-go bar engaged in unlawful gender discrimination.80 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 453 (1984) The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board has stated as recently as 2009 that it will issue citations against establishments which charge patrons differing amounts based on gender.See Liquor Control Board Advisory Opinion of July 9, 2009 Washington Ladies' nights have been found not to violate state anti-discrimination law, or the federal constitution, by the Washington Supreme Court, even if held at a stadium owned by a city.MacLean v. First Northwest Industries of America, Inc., 635 P.2d 683 (WA 1981). The Washington Supreme Court concluded that \\"the respondent has shown no discrimination against men as a class and no damage to himself. As a consequence he has no right of action under the state Law Against Discrimination. \\" In part, the court emphasized in its ruling evidence presented in the trial court that \\"women do not manifest the same interest in basketball that men do,\\" and that the discount was only one of many discounts and promotions, the others available regardless of gender. Finally, the majority noted that \\"to decide important constitutional questions upon a complaint as sterile as this would be apt to erode public respect for the Equal Rights Amendment and deter rather than promote the serious goals for which it was adopted.\\" The dissenting justices emphasized their broader interpretation of the applicable prohibition and the potential for such promotions to reinforce stereotypes. One dissenting justice proposed that the complainant be allowed no damages, but only that the practice be enjoined. The dissent concluded: :\\"It may be that application of the Equal Rights Amendment to the ‚Äúpromotional‚Äù activity of defendant is not the sort of thing the voters had in mind when they adopted HJR 61. Then again, an equally persuasive argument could be made that ticket price differentials based on sex were indeed one of a number of activities which they hoped to end. It is idle to speculate. No evidence of any kind exists. I see no escape from finding in this case that the plain language of Const. art. 31 proscribes the activity in which the defendants have engaged. Any further clarification of popular intent must come through the process of constitutional amendment, not by the imaginings of this court. Const. art. 23.\\" Wisconsin The Wisconsin Supreme Court has held that such promotions violate the state's public accommodation law.Novak v. Madison Motel Associates, 525 N.W.2d 123 (Wis. App. 1994). The court noted that the text and legislative history of the statute permitted no distinction between sex, race, and other forms of discrimination. Some comedy clubs and strip bars may allow patrons to enter without paying a fee, with the implicit or explicit expectation that the customers will buy alcoholic beverages while inside. Some bars with \\"no cover charge\\" policies may have higher prices for their snacks and beer to make up for the lack of a cover charge. Many nightclubs oriented towards electronic dance music have a cover charge, in some cases because many of their patrons are not drinking alcohol due to use of other drugs such as MDMA. Bottles of water are also often priced at up to $10 to offset the loss of revenue from reduced sales of alcohol.

Kriss is currently the Entrepreneur in Residence at the University of Miami. In 1976, Kriss produced and performed on Mike Bloomfield's If You Love These Blues, Play 'Em As You Please, nominated for a Grammy Award. He launched the instructional book and record division of Guitar Player Magazine and also co- founded Inner City Records, voted the Record Label of the Year in the 1979 International Jazz Critics Poll. In 1984, Kriss helped launch Bain Capital, which now manages over $65 billion in assets. He was CEO of MediQual Systems (1993‚Äì98), a healthcare information company, and founder/CEO of MediVision (1983‚Äì1989), a network of eye surgery centers.  Municipal Turnarounds  On September 11, 1991, the Massachusetts state legislature approved Governor William Weld's emergency request to appoint a state receiver to take over the City of Chelsea's bankrupt municipal government, the first state-designed municipal receivership in U.S. history. Weld named Jim Carlin, a businessman and former state Secretary of Transportation, to become the Chelsea receiver, reporting to Eric Kriss, who, as the assistant Administration and Finance secretary, had drafted the Chelsea legislation. Chelsea, directly across the Mystic River from Boston, had long been in economic decline with a spiraling fiscal crisis. Carlin and Kriss immediately undertook a broad municipal turnaround, with a focus on labor negotiations with the local Firefighters union. Boston University, already involved in local education, took over school administration. Within two years, Chelsea's budget was balanced, a restructured firefighters contract was negotiated, city operations were streamlined, and new school construction was underway. As the Receivership achieved stability, a charter change in 1995 implemented a new efficient council-manager form of government. Increased emphasis on economic development and capital improvement led to an influx of new business, and, as the turnaround reached maturity in 1998, Chelsea was named an All-American City by the National Civic League. In 2004, Springfield, the third largest city in Massachusetts and long suffering from economic decline, requested extraordinary state assistance to meet its financial obligations. Kriss, now Secretary for Administration and Finance, drafted a new receivership bill, modeled after his 1991 Chelsea legislation, that expanded upon the receiver's powers by suspending Chapter 150E, a key law that enfranchised public sector unions and defined the collective bargaining process in Massachusetts. After heated debate and intensive lobbying by public labor unions, the legislature placed Springfield into a state receivership controlled by Secretary Kriss on June 30, 2004, but without the proposed suspension of the Chapter 150E labor law. Without the Chapter 150E suspension, the state receivership entered into a long collective bargaining process with the teachers' union. In September 2006 agreement was finally reached on a new contract that included merit pay, the first time that student performance was explicitly tied to teacher compensation in a large urban school district in Massachusetts. The Springfield receivership, as in the earlier Chelsea experience, balanced the municipal budget, streamlined operations, and earned an upgrade in the city's bond rating. On June 30, 2009, the receivership returned governance of the city to local officials. In February 2004, Kriss advocated the elimination of the monopoly granted to public sector unions through state laws such as Chapter 150E in Massachusetts.Eric Kriss, The Fourth Branch of Government, February 2004 These remarks, plus the controversy over the original Kriss draft of the Springfield receivership legislation that suspended Chapter 150E, motivated Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government to host a debate between Secretary Kriss and two labor union supporters, Economics Professor Richard B. Freeman, co-faculty director of the Harvard University Trade Union Program, and Jack Donahue, a Kennedy School lecturer and director of the Weil Program in Collaborative Governance. The threat of escalating municipal labor costs due to Chapter 150E led Secretary Kriss to introduce the concept of Municipal Stability FactorsSecretary Kriss announces municipal budget tool, Government Technology, June 2005 as an online assessment tool for local officials. When he left office in September 2005, Kriss warned that overly generous contracts with public employees, together with a failure to control employee healthcare costs and an aversion to development that could spur new tax revenue, have doomed cities and towns to a dark financial future. \\"This is a quiet crisis, a crisis of attrition. It's not a Katrina, but if we extrapolate over the next couple of years, it will get worse and worse and worse.\\"Kriss says cities hamstrung by labor, Boston Globe, September 27, 2005  Open Formats  In early 2005, Kriss, along with state CIO Peter J. Quinn, advocated using open formats in public records: \\"It is an overriding imperative of the American democratic system that we cannot have our public documents locked up in some kind of proprietary format, perhaps unreadable in the future, or subject to a proprietary system license that restricts access.\\" At a September 16, 2005 meeting with the Mass Technology Leadership Council Kriss raised state sovereignty as the overriding issue surrounding public records. While supporting the principle of private intellectual property rights, he said sovereignty trumped any private company's attempt to control the state's public records through claims of intellectual property.MTLC Open Source SIG Wiki: OpenFormatMeetingSept2005 Subsequently, in September 2005, Massachusetts became the first state to formally endorse OpenDocument formats for its public records and, at the same time, reject proprietary formats such those used in Microsoft's Office software suite.  Massachusetts Turnpike  In August 2006, Governor Romney and the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority board asked Kriss to lead a comprehensive review of the Turnpike following the ouster of Chairman Matthew J. Amorello and the collapse of a portion of the roof of the Ted Williams Tunnel. On October 19, 2006, Kriss recommended to the board that all tolls, except on airport tunnels, be eliminated. The board then voted to remove tolls west of the 128 toll plaza by June 30, 2007, the first step in dismantling the Authority's original mission begun in 1952. In June 2009, Governor Deval Patrick signed legislation to formally end the Turnpike as a stand-alone authority on November 1, 2009.

Birth and Family Life Ellen Ternan was born in Rochester, Kent. She was the third of four children; she had a brother who died in infancy and two sisters named Maria and Frances (later the second wife of Thomas Adolphus Trollope, the brother of Anthony Trollope). Her parents, Thomas Lawless Ternan and Frances Eleanor Ternan (n√©e Jarman), were both actors of some distinction.  Theatre  Ternan made her stage debut in Sheffield at the age of three, and she and her two sisters were presented as \\"infant phenomena\\". Ellen was considered the least theatrically gifted of the three sisters, but she worked extensively in the provinces, particularly after her father died in October 1846 in the Bethnal Green Insane Asylum. The Invisible Woman, Claire Tomalin, p.53 In 1857, she was spotted by Charles Dickens performing at London's Haymarket Theatre. He cast her, on the recommendation of his friend, actor and playwright Alfred Wigan, along with her mother and sister Maria, in three performances of The Frozen Deep in Manchester in August, 1857. It was not unusual for professional actresses to be invited to appear with amateur gentlemen; Mrs Ternan played a Scottish nurse; Maria, the heroine Clara; and Nelly (Ellen) took over the girl's part from Katey Dickens, Dickens's seventeen-year-old daughter. Claire Tomalin, The Invisible Woman, p 72-73  Association with Charles Dickens  In mid- September 1857, Charles Dickens went with Wilkie Collins to Doncaster to see Ellen perform in The Pet of the Petticoats at the Theatre Royal, and wrote to John Forster that his relationship with his wife was disintegrating; 'Poor Catherine and I are not made for each other [-] What is now befalling I have seen steadily coming'. Claire Tomalin, The Invisible Woman, p.102 Dickens was 45 years-old when he met Ellen Ternan. She was 18 at the time, only slightly older than his daughter Katey. It is believed that Dickens began an affair with Ternan; however, the true nature of their relationship was kept secret from the general public. Ternan was clever, charming, a force of character, and interested in literature and the theatre. Dickens referred to Ternan as his \\"magic circle of one.\\" According to what is known, matters came to a head in 1858 when Catherine Dickens opened a packet delivered by a London jeweler which contained a gold bracelet meant for Ternan with a note written by her husband. Charles and Catherine Dickens separated that May, after 22 years of marriage. Ternan left the stage in 1860, and was financially supported by Dickens from that point onward. She sometimes traveled with him, which was the case in the event of the Staplehurst rail crash on June 9th, 1865 as Dickens was traveling with Ternan and her mother back from a visit to France. Allegedly, he abandoned a plan to take her on his visit to America in 1867 for fear that their relationship would be publicized by the American press. She lived in houses he took under false names at Slough and later at Nunhead. Although the truth of the issue has been highly speculated, Ternan may have given birth to a son by Dickens who died in infancy. There is little evidence pertaining to the nature of Charles Dickens and Ellen Ternan's relationship because neither Dickens, Ternan, nor Ternan's sisters left any account of the relationship, and most correspondence relevant to the relationship was destroyed. Dickens is thought by many scholars and commentators to have based several of his female characters on Ternan, including Estella in Great Expectations, Bella Wilfer in Our Mutual Friend and Helena Landless in The Mystery of Edwin Drood, and others may have been inspired by her, particularly Lucie Manette in A Tale of Two Cities. Dickens left a legacy of ¬£1,000 to Ternan in his will on his death in 1870 and sufficient income from a trust fund to ensure that she would never have to work again.  Later Life & Marriage  In 1876, six years after Dickens's death, Ternan married George Wharton Robinson, an Oxford graduate, who was 12 years her junior and knew nothing of her close association with Dickens. She presented herself as 14 years younger (23 years-old, rather than 37). The couple had a son, Geoffrey, and a daughter, Gladys, and ran a boys' school in Margate. Ternan's husband died in 1910, and she spent her last years in Southsea with her sister Frances. She died of cancer in Fulham, London and is buried in Highland Road Cemetery in Portsmouth.  Speculation and Research  The Dickens Fellowship and the surviving close family members of Charles Dickens maintained a facade of silence and denial about the affair from the time of Charles Dickens's death in 1870 until the death in December 1933 of his last surviving child, Sir Henry Fielding Dickens. Several Dickens researchers wrote about various aspects of the relationship between Ellen Ternan and Charles Dickens in the ensuing years, including Gladys Story in 1939, Ada Nisbet in 1952, Sir Felix Aylmer in 1959, and Katherine M Longley in 1985. Ellen Ternan was the subject of a bestselling biography by Claire Tomalin in 1990, which brought the relationship to a broader general audience. A summary of the story of the discovery of the relationship was published in 2012 by Professor Michael Slater. Some records relating to Ellen Ternan and her family are held by Senate House Library, University of London.Description of Ternan family papers Portrayal in Theatre and Television Simon Gray's play about her life, Little Nell, had its world premiere in 2007 at the Theatre Royal, Bath. It was directed by Sir Peter Hall and starred Louise Brealey as Ternan. The affair was featured in the docudramas Dickens (BBC, 2002) and Dickens' Secret Lovers (2008, Channel 4 ‚Äì it was the main subject of this programme, presented by Charles Dance and with Ternan played by Amy Shiels and Dickens by David Haig). Ternan is also featured in the novel Drood by Dan Simmons. The Invisible Woman is a 2013 feature film adaptation of Tomalin's book about Ternan's relationship with Charles Dickens. Ternan is played by Felicity Jones and Dickens by Ralph Fiennes, with the 21-year age difference between the actors being similar to the 27-year difference between Ternan and Dickens.

Swain's book River of Time: A Memoir of Vietnam chronicles his experiences from 1970 to 1975 during the war in Indochina, including the fall of Cambodia. Early life Swain was born in London in 1948 and is of English, Scots, Irish, French, and Spanish descent. After an unhappy education at the independent Blundell's School, from which he was expelled, he ran away to join the French Foreign Legion. Career For many years, Swain was The Sunday Times' correspondent in Paris. During this time he had many famous scoops, including uncovering the financial support extended by Libya's Colonel Gaddafi to Arthur Scargill's National Union of Mineworkers. He also reported for the newspaper from East Timor in 1999, at the time of its vote for independence. This period saw widespread violence by Indonesian-backed militias and by the Indonesian military itself, as Swain experienced first- hand. On the road to Becora, just east of Dili, together with American photographer Chip Hires and their Timorese driver and interpreter, Swain encountered, and was detained by, Indonesian soldiers of Battalion 745. In the same district, only a couple of hours later, these same soldiers would kill Dutch-born Financial Times journalist Sander Thoenes and attempt to kill his driver. The soldiers immediately abducted Swain's interpreter, rifle-butted the driver and gouged out an eye, and were looking for a discreet location to kill the two journalists and the driver. These three decided to escape, under fire, and hid in the bush. They then called The Sunday Times office in London on a mobile phone and The Times alerted the Australian forces in nearby Dili. Swain and Hires were rescued by helicopter. They located driver Sancho Ramos soon afterwards and were able to persuade the Australians to fly him to Darwin for immediate medical attention. The interpreter, Anacleto da Silva, has never been seen since. Swain has recounted the incident in print, and in a television interview for fellow journalist Step Vaessen, who was reporting from central Dili with her cameraman spouse, Andr√©. French journalist Denis Robert, who unveiled the \\"Clearstream affair\\", wrote in 2006 in his book \\"Clearstream, l'enqu√™te\\" that he believes Jon Swain was working in 2005 for Hakluyt & Company Limited, a private intelligence firm based in London with close links to MI6. Swain was portrayed by Julian Sands in the film The Killing Fields (1984).

The street circuit (course) was set up near the Renaissance Center and the Cobo Arena, also including a small part of the M-1 highway, also known as Woodward Avenue. It is a flat circuit, with elevation ranging from 176 to 184 metres above sea level. Formula One Created largely in an effort to improve the city's international image, the race meant that the United States would host three Grands Prix in the 1982 season, the only nation in F1 history to do so. (The other two US races, Long Beach and Las Vegas, had been added to the schedule for similar purposes.) The inaugural Detroit Grand Prix saw John Watson claim victory after starting in 17th place, the lowest grid position for an eventual race winner on a street circuit. (Watson would break his own record at Long Beach the next year by winning from 22nd place.) The Detroit street circuit's place in Formula One history was assured when Michele Alboreto won the 1983 race driving a Tyrrell 011. This was the last of 155 Grand Prix wins for the 3.0L Cosworth DFV V8 engine, dating back to its debut at the 1967 Dutch Grand Prix in the hands of dual World Champion Jim Clark. It was also the last of 23 Formula One race wins for Tyrrell, who had won their first Grand Prix at the 1971 Spanish Grand Prix with that year's World Champion Jackie Stewart driving the Tyrrell 003. The race soon gained a reputation for being horrendously demanding and gruelling, with the very bumpy track often breaking up badly under the consistently hot weather. It was perhaps the single hardest race on both car and driver in Formula One during the 1980s, often producing races of attrition in which a large number of cars would retire due to mechanical breakage or contact with the narrow concrete walls. Brakes and gearboxes in particular were tested to their breaking points - the drivers had to brake hard more than 20 times per lap and change gear around 50 to 60 times in one lap (cars still had manual gearboxes in those days), for 62 laps usually lasting around 1 minute and 45 seconds. At least half the field retired in each race; it was thus considered an achievement if a driver could even finish the race, let alone win it. The 1984 race, won by reigning World Champion Nelson Piquet, tied an F1 road course record by featuring 20 retirements. Shortly after the race, impurities were found in the water injection system of Martin Brundle's Tyrrell, causing him to be stripped of his 2nd-place finish and Tyrrell (by then the only team still using the naturally-aspirated DFV) to be disqualified from the entire 1984 season. The race's five classified finishers (discounting Brundle) is beaten only by the 1966 Monaco Grand Prix. By 1985, Detroit was the sole American venue on the F1 calendar - Las Vegas had been dropped after 1982, Long Beach switched to Champ Car for 1984, and a new event in Dallas only lasted one year after the heat and deteriorating track conditions almost saw it cancelled on the morning of the race. That year saw Ayrton Senna take pole position, and he went on to enjoy substantial success at the circuit, winning the 1986, 1987, and 1988 races there, as well as taking further pole positions in 1986 and 1988. The track was only moderately received by the drivers, and was disliked especially by world champions Alain Prost and Nelson Piquet. Despite his open dislike of the track, Prost did finish second in 1988, and third in 1986 and 1987 (all for McLaren). Piquet, who generally disliked street circuits (with the exception of the faster and more open Adelaide circuit in Australia), won at Detroit in 1984 and came second to Senna in 1987. Embarrassingly, Piquet hit the wall during practice for the 1988 race when he spun his Lotus-Honda into the wall coming out of turn 1. At the time, the Lotus had been carrying an onboard camera for some recorded laps. The 1988 race, similar to the failed Dallas event, was extremely hot, and the circuit broke up very badly due to the intense heat and humidity. After the race, the drivers were far more vocal in their criticism of the track, with race winner Senna comparing driving on the crumbled surface to driving in heavy rain. 1988 subsequently proved to be the last F1 race in Detroit, as the sport's governing body FISA ruled that its temporary pit area wasn't up to the required standard for a World Championship race. The United States Grand Prix moved to another street circuit in Phoenix, Arizona, while the Detroit event became a CART race. Trans-Am Starting in 1984, the SCCA Trans-Am Series held a support race during the Grand Prix weekend. The Motor City 100 was often regarded as one of the most important events of the Trans-Am schedule due to the increased television and sponsor exposure, made possible by the international broadcast of the Grand Prix. The Trans-Am race wasn't popular with the Formula One drivers though with the heavy and powerful Trans-Am cars with their huge rear wheels having a tendency to break up the track, already in a suspect state thanks to the heat of the summer when the races were scheduled. This often made the Grands Prix a more difficult prospect due to drivers having to go offline on to the 'dirty' part of the road to avoid problem areas on the track surface. CART Three CART races were held on the track which was altered slightly with the removal of the unpopular chicane immediately prior to the pits. Emerson Fittipaldi won the first and last races and Michael Andretti won the second race; Andretti also won pole position for each Detroit race. The final race featured an unusual lack of attrition as nearly 3/4 of the drivers finished. The race was not economically viable for the city, so the venue was changed to a temporary course on Belle Isle for the 1992 season. That event lasted until 2001 as a CART event and was briefly revived for the 2007 and 2008 American Le Mans Series and IndyCar Series seasons, and then again from 2012 onwards.

It forms several hydrates, the most common being the pentahydrate ¬∑5. Calcium lactate is used in medicine, mainly to treat calcium deficiencies; and as a food additive with E number of E327. Some cheese crystals consist of calcium lactate. Properties The lactate ion is chiral, with two enantiomers, D (‚àí,R) and L (+,S). The L isomer is the one normally synthesized and metabolized by living organisms, but some bacteria can produce the D form or convert the L to D. Thus calcium lactate also has D and L isomers, where all anions are of the same type. Some synthesis processes yield a mixture of the two in equal parts, resulting in the DL (racemic) salt. Both the L and the DL forms occur as crystals on the surface of aging Cheddar cheese.G.F. Tansman, P.S. Kindstedt, J.M. Hughes (2014): \\"Powder X-ray diffraction can differentiate between enantiomeric variants of calcium lactate pentahydrate crystal in cheese\\". Journal of Dairy Science, volume 97, issue 12, pages 7354‚Äì7362. The solubility of calcium L-lactate in water increases significantly in presence of d-gluconate ions, from 6.7 g/dl) at 25 ¬∞C to 9.74 g/dl or more.Martina Vavrusova, Merete B√∏gelund Munk, and Leif H.

Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry, volume 61 issue 34, pages 8207‚Äì8214. Paradoxically, while the solubility of calcium L-lactate increases with temperature from 10 ¬∞C (4.8 g/dl) to 30 ¬∞C (8.5 g/dl), the concentration of free ions decreases by almost one half. This is explained as the lactate and calcium ions becoming less hydrated and forming a complex .Martina Vavrusova, Ran Liang, and Leif H. Skibsted (2014): \\"Thermodynamics of Dissolution of Calcium Hydroxycarboxylates in Water\\". Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry, volume 62, issue 24, pages 5675‚Äì5681. The DL (racemic) form of the salt is much less soluble in water than the pure L or D isomers, so that a solution that contains as little as 25% of the D form will deposit racemic DL-lactate crystals instead of L-lactate.Gil Fils Tansman (2014): Exploring the nature of crystals in cheese through X-ray diffraction Masters Dissertation, University of Vermont The pentahydrate loses water in a dry atmosphere between 35 and 135 ¬∞C, being reduced to the anhydrous form and losing its crystalline character. The process is reversed at 25 ¬∞C and 75% relative humidity.Yukoh Sakata, Sumihiro Shiraishi, Makoto Otsuka (2005): \\"Characterization of dehydration and hydration behavior of calcium lactate pentahydrate and its anhydrate\\". Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces, volume 46, issue 3, pages 135‚Äì141. Preparation Calcium lactate can be prepared by the reaction of lactic acid with calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide. Since the 19th century, the salt has been obtained industrially by fermentation of carbohydrates in the presence of calcium mineral sources such as calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide.Kook Hwa Choi, Yong Keun Chang, and Jin-Hyun Kim (2011) \\"Optimization of Precipitation Process for the Recovery of Lactic Acid\\". KSBB Journal, volume 26, pages 13-18. (Abstract) Fermentation may produce either D or L lactate, or a racemic mixture of both, depending on the type of organism used.Rojan P. John, K. Madhavan Nampoothiri, Ashok Pandey (2007): \\"Fermentative production of lactic acid from biomass: an overview on process developments and future perspectives\\" Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, volume 74, issue 3, pages 524‚Äì534 Uses =Medicine= Calcium lactate has several uses in human and veterinary medicine. Calcium lactate is used in medicine as an antacid. Calcium lactate is also used to treat hypocalcaemia (calcium deficiencies). It can be absorbed at various pHs, thus it does not need to be taken with food. However, in this use it has been found to be less convenient than calcium citrate.Deborah A. Straub (2007): \\"Calcium Supplementation in Clinical Practice: A Review of Forms, Doses, and Indications\\". Nutrition in Clinical Practice, volume 22, issue 3, pages 286‚Äì296. In the early 20th century, oral administration of calcium lactate dissolved in water (but not in milk or tablets) was found to be effective in prevention of tetany in humans and dogs with parathyroid insufficiency or who underwent parathyroidectomy.Sloan J. Wilson (1938): \\"Postoperative Parathyroid Insufficiency and Calcium Lactate\\". Archives of Surgery, volume 37, issue 3, pages 490-497. A.B. Luckhardt and B.

Food and Drug Administration (2016): Code of Federal Regulations: Title 21 Volume 3, section 21CFR184.1207 \\"Calcium lactate\\", revised April 1, 2016 Calcium lactate is also known as cheese lactate because it coagulates milk, making the chhena used in the production of paneer cheese. Chhena is also used to make various sweets and other milk proteins. Calcium lactate is an ingredient in some baking powders containing sodium acid pyrophosphate. It provides calcium in order to delay leavening.E.J. Pyler (1988), Baking Science and Technology, Sosland Publishing Calcium lactate is added to sugar-free foods to prevent tooth decay. When added to chewing gum containing xylitol, it increases the remineralization of tooth enamel. The compound is also added to fresh-cut fruits, such as cantaloupes, to keep them firm and extend their shelf life, without the bitter taste caused by calcium chloride, which can also be used for this purpose. Calcium lactate is used in molecular gastronomy as a flavorless fat-soluble agent for plain and reverse spherification. It reacts with sodium alginate to form a skin around the food item. =Animal feeds= Calcium lactate may be added to animal rations as a source of calcium.B.N. Paul, S. Sarkar, S. S. Giri, S. N Mohanty, P. K. Mukhopadhyay (2006): \\"Dietary calcium and phosphorus requirements of rohu Labeo rohita fry\\". Animal Nutrition and Feed Technology, volume 6, issue 2, pages 257-263 =Chemistry= The compound was formerly an intermediate in the preparation of lactic acid for food and medical uses. The impure acid from various sources was converted to calcium lactate, purified by crystallization, and then converted back to acid by treatment with sulfuric acid, which precipitated the calcium as calcium sulfate. This method yielded a purer product than would be obtained by distillation of the original acid.H. Benninga (1990): \\"A History of Lactic Acid Making: A Chapter in the History of Biotechnology\\".

As of 2005, one book consisting entirely of Kuromasu puzzles has been published by Nikoli. Rules Kuromasu is played on a rectangular grid. Some of these cells have numbers in them. Each cell may be either black or white. The object is to determine what type each cell is. The following rules determine which cells are which: * Each number on the board represents the number of white cells that can be seen from that cell, including itself. A cell can be seen from another cell if they are in the same row or column, and there are no black cells between them in that row or column. * Numbered cells may not be black. * No two black cells may be horizontally or vertically adjacent. * All the white cells must be connected horizontally or vertically. Solution methods Any cell with a number in it must be white. This is very important. For example, suppose there is a 2 cell with another numbered cell next to it. Then clearly both the 2 cell and the other cell can be seen from the 2 cell. No other cells can be visible from the 2, or else we'd exceed the count. Therefore, all other neighboring cells to the 2 must be black. Also, the cell beyond the other numbered cell must be black. This is a good way to start some puzzles. Suppose a 2 and another numbered cell or white cell are in the same row or column with just one space between them. Then the cell in the middle must be black, because if it were white, the 2 would be able to see at least 3 cells. This can also get you started on some puzzles quickly. If the number inside a cell is equal to the maximum number of cells it could possibly see, then all those cells must be white in order for that maximum to be possible. For example, in a 7√ó7 puzzle, the maximum number you can have in any cell is 13 (the cell itself, plus six others in the row, plus six other in the column). If a 13 appears in a cell of a 7√ó7 puzzle, all cells in the same row or column as the 13 must be white. This is often represented by placing dots in those cells. There are other methods. Deciding if a Kuromasu puzzle is solvable is NP-complete. History Kuromasu is an original puzzle of Nikoli; it first appeared in Puzzle Communication Nikoli #34 (June 1991).

The eastern branch includes the rocky top of Little Harter Fell (2,234 ft), and Adam Seat (2,185 ft) which is marked by a prominent boundary stone. This ridge continues down to Gatescarth Pass before rising again to Branstree. Connecting to the centre of the summit horseshoe, producing a shape not unlike a tuning fork in plan, is Harter Fell's third ridge. This starts lower down the fell-side and cannot be seen from the summit. This ridge is all together rockier in character and leads swiftly down to Nan Bield Pass for onward connections to Mardale Ill Bell and High Street. The western slopes of the fell above Kentmere Reservoir are moderately steep, with an area of historic landslip surrounding Dry Gill. A low subsidiary ridge juts out into Kentmere, separating it from the valley of Ullstone Gill. This is named for The Ullstone, a prominent erratic boulder. The summit horseshoe of Harter Fell forms the head of Wren Gill, the main headwater of the River Sprint in Longsleddale. At Wrengill Quarry near the base of the slope, the Gill drops into sinkholes, reappearing from the ground a few yards lower down. The slopes on this south eastern side of the fell are gentle and generally grassy. To the north above the head of Mardale, Harter Fell shows a different character. Extensive crags, unnamed on Ordnance Survey maps, drop 1,300 ft to the valley. Further crags fringe the descending ridge to Nan Bield. Below these is the beautiful mountain tarn of Small Water. This corrie tarn, with a depth of around 50 ft has brown trout and perch.Blair,D: Exploring Laleland Tarns:Lakeland Manor Press (2003) Ascents The walkers' passes of Nan Bield and Gatescarth provided historic trade routes from Mardale to Kentmere and Longsleddale respectively. With the submergence of Mardale Green village beneath Haweswater reservoir in the 1940s, their original purpose has died, but both routes still provide good access for fellwalkers and are the easiest ways onto Harter Fell. The upper sections still bear the original zig-zags over steep ground. The fell is most frequently climbed from Mardale, as there is road access along the shore of Haweswater. Harter Fell summit is 1 mile or 1.5 km southwest and 1,800 ft or 550 m above the carpark at the head of the reservoir. Crags block a direct ascent, however, and Harter Fell is thus normally climbed via Gatescarth Pass to the east of the summit, or Nan Bield Pass to the west. These two passes also provide the easiest access from Kentmere or Longsleddale. A longer route from the Kent valley follows the ridge that separates it from Longsleddale, taking in Kentmere Pike on the way. This may form part of the Kentmere Horseshoe walk which also includes the Ill Bell ridge. An ascent of Harter Fell may also be combined with fells such as Branstree, Mardale Ill Bell and High Street to form a high-level circuit of Mardale from the road end. Finally, direct ascents from Longsleddale can also be made up the grassy slopes above Wrengill Quarry. Summit As well as a pile of stones, the summit cairn of Harter Fell carries many pieces of ironwork salvaged from the fence. Some of these resemble upended pitchforks, and when encountered unexpectedly on a misty day, the effect is faintly nightmarish.Alfred Wainwright:A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 2: A second cairn to the north carries similar decoration. The view is good all round and can be improved by moving to the rim of the crags, bringing the full length of Haweswater into sight. Listing Harter Fell was originally listed as a Marilyn in Alan Dawson's The Relative Hills of Britain, but it was later found not to have the required 150 m of relative height, missing out by 1 metre.

The story takes place in Faulkner's fictional city Jefferson, Mississippi, in the southern county of Yoknapatawpha. It was Faulkner's first short story published in a national magazine. Title Faulkner described the title \\"A Rose For Emily\\" as an allegorical title: this woman had undergone a great tragedy, and for this Faulkner pitied her. As a salute, he handed her a rose. The word \\"rose\\" in the title has multiple meanings to it. The rose may be seen as Homer, when interpreting the rose as a dried rose. Homer's body could be the dried rose, such as one that is pressed between the pages of a book, kept in perfect condition as Emily did with Homer's body. The rose also represents secrecy. Roses have been portrayed in Greek legends as a gift of secrecy and of confidentiality, known as sub rosa, implying that the rose is a symbol of silence between the narrator and Miss Emily, whose secrets the narrator keeps until her death. Plot summary The story opens with a brief first-person account of the funeral of Emily Grierson, an elderly Southern woman whose funeral is the obligation of their small town. It then proceeds in a non- linear fashion to the narrator's recollections of Emily's archaic and increasingly strange behavior throughout the years. Emily is a member of a family of the antebellum Southern aristocracy. After the Civil War, the family falls into hard times. She and her father, the last two of the clan, continue to live as if in the past; Emily's father refuses for her to marry. Her father dies when Emily is about the age of 30, which takes her by surprise. She refuses to give up his corpse, and the townspeople write it off as her grieving process. The townspeople pity Emily not only after her father's death but also during his life when he wouldn't let Emily marry. Emily depended heavily on her father, believing he would never leave her; he was all she had. After her father's death, the only person seen moving about Emily's home is Tobe, a black man serving as Emily's butler. He is frequently seen entering and exiting the house for groceries. Although Emily did not have a strong relationship with her community, she did give art lessons to young children within her town at the age of forty. A prime reason why she gave art lessons was her financial problem since she was running out of money. The townspeople make cruel comments and nasty looks behind Miss Emily's back, as she wasn't respected in her town. With the acceptance of her father's death, Emily somewhat revives, even changing the style of her hair, and becomes friendly with Homer Barron. He is a Northern laborer who comes to town shortly after Mr. Grierson's death. The connection surprises some of the community while others are glad she is taking an interest; however, \\"Homer likes men and claims that he is not a marrying man.\\" This draws attention to Homer's questionable sexuality in the story. Emily shortly buys arsenic from a druggist in town, presumably to kill rats, however, the townspeople are convinced that she will use it to poison herself. Emily's distant cousins are called into town by the minister's wife to supervise Miss Emily and Homer Barron. Homer leaves town for some time, reputedly to give Emily a chance to get rid of her cousins, and returns three days later after the cousins have left. After he is observed entering Miss Emily's home one evening, Homer is never seen alive again. Despite these turnabouts in her social status, Emily continues to behave mysteriously, as she had before her father died. Her reputation is such that the city council finds itself unable to confront her about a strong smell that has begun to emanate from the house. They believed Tobe was unable to maintain the house and something was rotting, unaware that a death has occurred. Instead, the council decide to send men to her house under the cover of darkness to sprinkle lime around the house, after which the smell dissipates. The mayor of the town, Colonel Sartorius, makes a gentleman's agreement to overlook her taxes as an act of charity, though it is done under a pretense of repayment towards her father, to assuage Emily's pride after her father's death. Years later, when the next generation has come to power, Emily insists on this informal arrangement, flatly refusing that she owes any taxes, stating \\"I have no taxes in Jefferson.\\" After this, the council declines to press the issue due to her stubbornness. Emily has become a recluse: she is never seen outside of the house, and only rarely accepts people into it. The community eventually comes to view her as a \\"hereditary obligation\\" on the town, who must be humored and tolerated. The funeral is a large affair: Emily had become an institution, so her death sparks a great deal of curiosity about her reclusive nature and what remains of her house. After she is buried, a group of townsfolk enters her house to see what remains of her life there. Tobe walked out of the house and was never seen again, giving the townspeople access to Miss Emily's home. The door to her upstairs bedroom is locked, and some of the townsfolk break down the door to see what has been hidden for so long. Inside, among the possessions that Emily had bought for Homer, lies the decomposed corpse of Homer Barron on the bed. On the pillow beside him is the indentation of a head and a single strand of gray hair, indicating that Emily had slept with Homer's corpse. The house is an indicator revealing how Emily struggled to keep everything the same, in a frozen time period, avoiding change.  Characters  Emily Grierson - The main character of the story. Emily's father kept her from seeing suitors and controlled her social life, keeping her in isolation until his death, when she is 30 years old. Her struggle with loss and attachment is the impetus for the plot, driving her to kill Homer Barron, the man that is assumed to have married her. Emily presumably poisons and kills Homer, as she sees murder as the only way to keep Homer with her permanently. She treats him as her living husband even after his death, which is shown by her keeping his clothes in the room, keeping his engraved wedding items on the dresser, and the strand of her hair found beside his corpse at the end of the story that indicated she even slept beside him. Emily's murderous act also displays her obstinate nature. This is evident in Emily's refusal to pay her taxes, her denial of her father's death, and the fact that she kills Homer to ensure that he will never leave her. Homer Barron - Emily's romantic interest. He is later found dead and decomposed in Emily's bedroom after her funeral. He initially enters the story as a foreman for a road construction project occurring in the town. He is soon seen to be with Emily in her Sunday carriage rides, and it is expected for them to be married. Homer differs from the rest of the town because he is a Northerner. The story takes place in the South shortly after the Civil War, and while Homer is not necessarily unwelcome to the town, he does stand out. This, along with the fact that he is seemingly courting Emily, sets him apart from all of the other characters in the story. It is because he is an outlier that Emily becomes attracted to him. It is generally unknown if Homer reciprocates the romantic feelings Emily has for him. It is stated in the story that Homer likes men and is \\"not the marrying kind;\\" he has commitment issues. Furthermore, this brings into light Homer's homosexuality. The Narrator - An unnamed member(s) of the town who watches the events of Emily's life unfold in its entirety. The story is presented to the reader in a non- chronological order; this suggests that the story may have been patched together by multiple tellers. Some parts of the story are repeated, such as Homer's disappearance, the idea that Emily and Homer will get married, and Emily's refusal to pay taxes, also indicating that the narrator is a voice for the town. Though the townspeople disapprove of most of Emily's actions, such as refusing to pay her taxes and purchasing poison, nobody intervenes. Colonel Sartoris - The former mayor who remitted Emily's taxes. While he is in the story very little, his decision to remit Emily's taxes leads to her refusal to pay them ever again, contributing to her stubborn personality. The reason for Sartoris remitting her taxes is never given, only that he told Emily it was because her father loaned the money to the town. Mr. Grierson - Emily's father, the patriarchal head of the Grierson family. His control over Emily's personal life prohibited her from romantic involvement. The reason for his refusal to let Emily court men is not explained in the story. Whatever the reason, Mr. Grierson shapes the person that Emily becomes. His decision to ban all men from her life drives her to kill the first man she is attracted to and can be with, Homer Barron, in order to keep him with her permanently. The cousins - Emily's extended relatives from Alabama. They come to town during Emily's courting of Homer Barron to check on Emily's well-being. They are thought of as even more uptight and stuffy than Emily by the townspeople. They are called in to prevent Emily and Homer from marrying; however, they are later sent back home so that the two can be wed. It is speculated that there may be some type of dispute between Emily and the cousins, indicated by them living far away from Emily and the fact that they did not attend Emily's father's funeral. Tobe - Emily's cook/gardener, who is also acts as her secret keeper. Tobe is a loyal individual to Emily. During the years of Emily's isolation, he provides no details of her life to the townspeople and promptly disappears directly following her death. He became old and stooped from all of his work while Emily grew large and immobile. This could suggest that he resented Emily, or at the very least disliked working for her, as he does not mourn her or stay for her funeral.  Structure  Faulkner tells the story using two different methods: a series of flashbacks in which the events are told with subjectivity and detail, and from an objective perspective in which the narrator fades into a plural pronoun \\"we\\" to demonstrate a linear causality of events. Had the story been told in a linear fashion, this understanding would, perhaps, have been lost, something Faulkner knew and incorporated into the story. By presenting the story in terms of present and past events, he could examine how they influence each other. In terms of mathematical precision, time moves on and what exists is only the present. In terms of the more subjective time, time moves on but memories can exist no matter how much time changes. Those memories stay unhindered. It starts with the announcement of Emily's death, an event that has the entire town talking. This leads the reader to assume that she was an important figure in the town. As Fassler says in his article ‚ÄúThe Key,‚Äù ‚ÄúClearly, this lady who died unmarried was of importance to everyone. And yet the town itself is eventually divided,‚Äùhttps://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/the-key-to- writing-a-mystery-is-asking-the-perfect-question/515799/ by upsetting the linear flow of the chronology of the narration, the short story focuses on the minute details that lead to different conclusions towards the end of the story. If Faulkner presented the story in a linear fashion, the chances of the reader sympathizing with Emily would be far less. By telling the story out of order, the reader sees Emily as a tragic product of her environment rather than a twisted necrophiliac. Based on the townspeople's thoughts of Emily displayed in this section, the reader discovers that the town was not dreading Emily's death. On the other hand, it was somewhat welcomed. Emily was just a \\"hereditary obligation\\" who was desperately trying to cling to old traditions and ways of life. With her passing on, the town can finally be free of this remnant, being wholly set in the present. Through this Faulkner could analyze the depth at which Miss Emily could change as a character.  Themes  \\"A Rose for Emily\\" discusses many dark themes that characterized the Old South and Southern Gothic fiction. The story explores themes of death and resistance to change. Also, it reflects the decaying of the societal tenets of the South in the 1930s. Emily Grierson had been oppressed by her father for most of her life and hadn't questioned it because that was her way of living. Likewise, the antiquated traditions of the south (often harmful, such as in the treatment of black people) had remained acceptable, as that was their way of living. Once her father had passed, Emily, in denial, refused to give his corpse up for burial‚Äîthis shows her inability to functionally adapt to change. When the present mayor and aldermen insist Miss Emily pay the taxes which she had been exempted from, she refuses and continues to live in her house. Miss Emily's stubborn insistence that she \\"pays no taxes in Jefferson\\" and her mistaking the new mayor for Colonel Sartoris brings into question whether her acts of resistance are a conscious act of defiance or a result of a decayed mental stability. The reader is only shown Emily from an external perspective, we can not ascertain whether she acts in a rational manner or not. The death of Homer, if interpreted as having been a murder, can be seen in the context of the north‚Äìsouth clash. Homer, notably a northerner, is not one for the tradition of marriage. In the framework that his death was not an accident, but a murder on the part of Emily, Homer's rejection of the marriage can be seen as the North's rejection of Southern tradition. The South ends its relations with the North in retaliation. Emily continuing to sleep next to Homer's body can be seen as the south holding on to an ideal that is no longer feasible. Control and its repercussions is a persistent theme throughout the story. Emily's father was an intimidating and manipulative figure, keeping her from experiencing life in her own terms. She was never able to grow, learn, live her life, start a family, and marry the one she truly loved. Even after Emily's father died, his presence and impact on his daughter were still apparent. Discussing Emily and her father, the townspeople said \\"We had long thought of them as a tableau, Miss Emily a slender figure in white in the background, her father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip, the two of them framed by the back-flung front door.\\". Emily is portrayed as small and powerless, placed behind the overbearing frame of her father. She wears white, a symbol of innocence and purity. Emily falls victim to the ruling hand of her father and to her place in the society: she has to uphold the noblesse oblige to which she was born into. In this way, her father's influence remains after he has passed. This control leads to Emily's isolation, both externally and internally imposed. Emily is alone, yet always being watched by the townspeople; she is both apart from and a part of the community. Her position prevents her from ever finding happiness. The power of death is a consistent theme throughout the story. Emily herself is portrayed as a \\"skeleton\\" that is both \\"small and spare\\" which is representative of the fact that she emanates death. When it comes to death itself, Emily is in denial and most of that feeling has to do with her loneliness. After her father dies, she keeps his corpse for three days and refuses to admit that he is dead. The reader also sees this with the corpse of Homer Barron, except she is the one who inflicts death upon him. She poisons him and keeps him locked away in her room; she did not want to lose the only other person she had ever loved, so she made his stay permanent. These examples show that the power of death triumphs over everything, including \\"poor Emily\\", herself. Due to this inevitability in the portrayal of death, A Rose for Emily is seen as a tale based on determinism, making the short story part of the naturalism literary movement. Here, a character's fate is already determined no matter how much the individual struggles to change it. There are impersonal forces of nature that prevent him or her from taking control. As the very universe itself appears indifferent, this character descends into an inevitable death and decay. The case of Emily is the same. She had a mental illness, an unavoidable fate, which her father must have sought to finally end by refusing to let Emily marry, which would have continued his line. No matter what she did, there was the implication that she would ultimately go mad. There was also the depiction of a cursed land due to slavery and the class structure based upon it and that no matter how the people clung to the glorious past and soldier on, there was a tarnished way of life that leads to an impending ruin.  Critical response  Floyd C. Watkins wrote about the structure of \\"A Rose for Emily\\" in \\"Modern Language Notes\\". Watkins claims that this is Faulkner's best story and that he is among the best American writers of this time period. Faulkner had to carefully dissect his sections, bringing importance to every aspect of Miss Emily's life, but Watkins sees this as a \\"structural problem\\" but later goes on to rave about the symmetry of this short story. Watkins enjoys this story in its entirety, and is impressed by Faulkner's ordering, as building suspense was an important aspect in the response.Watkins, Floyd C. \\"Structure of \\"A Rose for Emily\\".\\" Modern Language Notes 7th ser. 69 (1954): 508-10. JSTOR. Web. 5 Apr. 2017. The critical response by John Skinner explores the interpretations of Faulkner's short story in detail while reviewing the importance of over-analyzing a piece of literary work. William Faulkner published this story in the 1930s, Skinner had published his critical response in 1985. More than 40 years have passed and people are still ignoring his claim. The characters and theme of this tale have been scrutinized by many. There have been numerous interpretations of what Miss Emily stands for; Skinner gives examples of scholars including S.W. M. Johnson ‚ÄúEmily represented a refusal to submit to, or even concede, to the inevitability of change‚Äù. Whereas, William Going pictures Emily as a rose, ‚Äúthe treasured memory of the Confederate veterans‚Äù. The point of view according to Skinner is of immediate relevance to the story as the chief character, the narrator tells the chronology of the story. This narrator gives approximately ‚Äúround figures‚Äù for the important events of the accounts. Yet the exact chronology is of little relevance to the overall importance of the story itself. John Skinner states that Faulkner should be taken literally, appreciate his formal subtlety in his works. Alice Petry introduces a different type of critical response that is not focused on the usual subjects. Rather, she focuses on the complex and provocative language. For example, Hall discusses how the sentence, \\"Thus she passed from generation to generation- dear, inescapable, impervious, tranquil and perverse\\" has been considered misleading, but is in fact strategically placed to provide foreshadowing and unification of plot. The five descriptive words used in the sentence each correspond to one of the five parts in the order they are seen. For example, the adjective \\"inescapable\\" corresponds to Part II, to the incident of the strange smell coming from Miss Emily's home. Faulkner's placement of these adjectives at the end of Part IV serves as an important unifying sentence that connects all five parts to each other. Jim Barloon of the University of St. Thomas wrote about an idea introduced to him by his students, that Homer was homosexual, possibly providing another reason for his murder. He proposes that Emily did not kill Homer because of her own insecurities, but also because he did not reciprocate her romantic feelings. Thus, she could have murdered him out of affection as well as spite. Whether or not this theory is correct, it proves that the story is still being closely analyzed decades after it was written. As Barloon states in his article, ‚ÄúPositing that Homer Barron is gay not only raises a new set of questions but transforms [the story], or at least our perspective of it.‚Äùhttp://www.semo.edu/cfs/teaching/10186.html The psychology of Emily Grierson has been analyzed countless times, with many people reaching the conclusion that she was mentally ill, and from that point, the reasons why. Though many different diagnoses have been made, the most common can be summarized as follows by Nicole Smith in her psychological analysis of the character: ‚ÄúIt is reasonable to propose that Miss Emily developed [schizophrenia] as a response to the demanding conditions in which she was living as a Southern woman from an aristocratic family.‚Äùhttp://www.articlemyriad.com/psychological-character-analysis-rose- emily/ This has been thought to represent just how unbearable life in the old South could be, not only for a person similar to Emily but to the people around them as well. A contributing factor to this point would change. The story is an allegory for the change that the South dealt with after the Civil War, with Emily representing the resistance of that change. This is shown in the story through Emily's conflicts with the town and her refusal of cooperation. Tuncay Tezcan in his analysis of the story states, ‚ÄúIt represents the numerous conflicts in the main character's life, illustrating the effect of social change on the individual.‚Äù There has been much discussion over the title of the story. Why have a rose for Emily? At that time, giving a rose to a woman was common if they had been through a great tragedy. Emily's tragedy is her environment, changing quickly and with volatility, causing her to cling to the past in hopes of stopping the change from occurring. This has a deep impact on her mental state, driving her to extreme acts such as murdering Homer and then sleeping with his corpse for years. The town does nothing to stop these events, merely entertain the idea. Terry Heller writes in his analysis of the story that the town, ‚Äú[chose] to deal with an idea of Emily, rather than with Emily herself; they are different in that they have different ideas of her and, therefore, approach her‚Ä¶ differently.‚Äùhttp://www.public.coe.edu/~theller/essays/rose.html Emily died a broken person, and for that Faulkner gave her a rose, in sympathy of her ending.

Construction commenced in late 2001 on the , ¬£25 million site, and is still ongoing. Almost of business premises have been delivered, largely attributed to Phase One of the scheme. Over 1,000 people are based there. The idea was first promoted by local developer the Alaska Group, which entered into a partnership with Shropshire County Council. Mainly offices, the business park includes a Holiday Inn Express Hotel and a children's daycare centre. Plans exist for a cafe retail unit at the heart of the development. Alaska Group was founded in London in 1994 in a former fur factory known as the Alaska Works, where skins were imported from Alaska. The company has no other connection with Alaska, however it gave the Park several quotes from that State. The main route through the Park, Sitka Drive, is named after the National tree of Alaska. Other names include Anchorage Avenue, Mt McKinley Building, Bering House and Juneau House. Located around 3 miles / 5km south east of the town centre of Shrewsbury, Shropshire's county town, the business park lies on the junction of the A5 bypass and the B4380, near to Emstrey. The park's appeal is partly thanks to excellent transport links via the nearby M54 motorway to Telford, Wolverhampton and Birmingham, while being near to a fine medieval town and beautiful countryside. Other business park developments in and around the town include the Oxon Business Park to the West of the town centre and the Battlefield Enterprise Park to the North, and Abbey Lawn next to Shrewsbury Abbey, just across the Severn from the town centre. Buildings The Alaska Building A typical building style on the site The park's buildings are a combination of fully customised modern and traditional structures, all with dedicated parking. The Creative Quarter is home to five offices, The Alaska Building (Pictured Right), Global House, Mercury House, Jupiter House and the Community Council Building Mtech's office, seen bottom right, is typical of some of the smaller properties available on the development. The Professional Quarter is of more traditional brick design and includes professional clients including Handelsbanken. Phase 2 Work started in 2008 on phase 2 of Shrewsbury Business Park after Alaska Group agreed a new Partnership with Shropshire Council, following the success of phase 1. Another 20,000 m¬≤ is planned and the first three buildings are now nearing completion. Deutsche Bank are the first occupiers of phase 2.

Storm Warning tracks three characters as a major disaster looms over the fictional world of Valdemar. Plot summary When Storm Warning begins, Emperor Charliss, the Eastern Emperor (first mentioned in Winds of Fury) knows he is dying and must name a successor. Grand Duke Tremane, a Commander in the Army, is currently his favorite choice. Tremane is sent to Hardorn, a country the Imperial Army recently invaded after the Hardornen King, Ancar, was killed by a group of assassins from Valdemar. Tremane understands that he must succeed in this mission or he will be killed. Meanwhile, in Haven, the capital city of Valdemar, An'desha shena Jor'ethan, a young Shin'a'in Adept, is feeling lonely. While Adept Firesong k'Treva, his lover, is perfectly at home in Haven, An'desha feels left out and alien. He spends almost all of his time in Firesong's ekele, an environment something like a cross between a sukkah and a treehouse and something like the flets of the elves in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, where he meditates and tends the plants in the garden. However, he has been having premonitions of approaching doom. Neither he nor Firesong can explain these premonitions. Also, An'desha has an Adept-class (the highest level of ability of magic) potential, but refuses to be trained, believing his powers to be tainted by Falconsbane, by whom An'desha was earlier possessed. Ambassador Ulrich of Karse has been sent with his assistant, Karal Austreben, a novice Sun-priest, to negotiate peace between Karse and Valdemar. At the border, a single escort arrives, who seems to Karal to be some sort of Court official dressed in white and mounted on a white stallion; he later discovers this man is a Herald. As they ride north, Karal examines himself and his attitudes towards the people of Valdemar and the Heralds. Karsites are taught to fear the Heralds and Mages, who are said to have \\"witch powers\\". On their arrival in Haven they are greeted by the Seneschal, Lord Palinor, Kyril, the Seneschal's Herald, and Prince-Consort Daren. Karel is glad of the rest, but as the weeks pass, begins to feel lonely. Talia, the Queen's Own Herald, introduces him to An'desha. Karal and Ulrich, much to Firesong's chagrin and jealousy, help An'desha to become less afraid of his power, as well as to become more independent. References * Lackey, Mercedes. Storm Warning.

The Central Overland California and Pike's Peak Express Company was a stagecoach line that operated in the American West in the early 1860s, but it is most well known as the parent company of the Pony Express. It was formed as a subsidiary of the freighting company Russell, Majors, and Waddell, after the latter two partners bought out Russell's stage line, the Leavenworth and Pikes Peak Express Company. The stage line had made its first journey from Westport, Missouri, to Denver on March 9, 1859. Its stage lines ran from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Denver and Salt Lake City and it succeeded the George Chorpenning contract for mail service from Utah to California in May 1860. In an attempt to win a more lucrative contract with the United States government, it started an express mail service between St. Joseph and San Francisco on April 3, 1860, known as the Pony Express. Maintenance of frequent stage service and heavy losses from the Pony Express brought embarrassment to the C. O. C. & P. P. Express. When the Pony Express became obsolete upon completion of the Transcontinental Telegraph, the business ran out of cash and was sold to Ben Holladay for $100,000. Russell, Majors and Waddell As the United States expanded westward in the early 19th century, the military erected forts and supply depots to protect and support this expansion. Initially the federal government contracted individuals or small companies to supply each post independently, but as the number of military posts continued to grow this system became increasingly time-consuming and inefficient. In 1854, Quartermaster General Thomas Jesup decided to change the system and implemented a single two-year contract to supply most of the posts west of the Missouri River. This consolidated contract was worth a lot of money and required more resources than many of the previous suppliers possessed. Alexander Majors was one of the individuals contracted by the United States government to supply military forts prior to 1854. He hauled freight along the Santa Fe Trail and had a reputation for success. William Waddell was a store owner in Lexington, Missouri, who was described as \\"phlegmatic, stoical, ... a cautious penny- pincher, and unable to reach a decision without ponderous deliberation.\\" In 1852 Waddell partnered in a wholesale trading firm with William Hepburn Russell, a good-looking entrepreneur of mixed success with social ambitions. In 1855, Waddell and Russell brought on Majors to go after the new military supply contract. Three months after forming their partnership, the firm of Russell, Majors, and Waddell received a two-year contract to supply all the military posts west of the Mississippi River. The three partners divided the labor based on the skills that each member brought to the firm. William Waddell managed the finances and made sure that their business activities ran smoothly. William Russell was the company salesman, generating contracts with the government and others as well as dealing with bankers to secure financing. Alexander Major oversaw the freighting operations which included hiring labor, supervising the loading and transport of freight, and making sure the trains were operating on time. The relationship between the three men were generally fine; Majors and Waddell had a similar conservative temperament and though Russell was the opposite, he was often on the East Coast seeking new contracts and investments. With a virtual monopoly on all western freighting contracting Russell, Majors, and Waddell became the largest freighting company in western Missouri. The new contract with the War Department required a great deal of investment. Warehouses, stables, corrals, and wagon shops needed to be built and maintained; Wagon masters, freight handlers, herders and teamsters needed to be hired, housed, and paid; Oxen, wagons, and other equipment had to be acquired, stored, and moved about. The division of labor between the three partners of Russell, Majors, and Waddell was an important component in their success and the experience gained in organizing and managing the freighting enterprise served them well in their future endeavors. Between 1855 and 1856, the first two years of their government contract, business prospered and the firm made a profit of $300,000. Russell, Majors, and Waddell diversified, buying land and opening new stores. The success of the firm in handling the War Department's freighting naturally made them the choice for the next round and in February 1857 they signed the second contract. In May 1857, the firm's wagon trains had been on the road for over a month when the Utah War broke out between the Mormons and the United States government. The government assembled 2,500 troops to send to Utah and required Russell, Majors, and Waddell to gather additional \\"wagons to transport two and half to three million pounds of military freight\\" to send with them. The company financed the new expedition by taking out large loans and leaning heavily on their credit. Over the course of the Utah War three wagon trains, worth more than $125,000 at the time, were lost. Having already maxed out their credit the company could not find new financiers and was practically bankrupt. Adding to their difficulties was the fact that Congress was unhappy with the war and did not pass the usual funding bill for the War Department which delayed payment for the 1857 contract. Despite this, the War Department required supplies and John B. Floyd, the Secretary of War, personally guaranteed the 1857 contract. Though an unusual situation, this allowed Russell, Majors, and Waddell to secure more credit and finance new supply trains. Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company Typical stagecoach of the Concord type used by express companies on the overland trails. Soldiers guard from atop, ca. 1869 In July 1858, Green Russell and Sam Bates found a small amount of gold in Little Dry Creek, the first significant gold discovery in the Rocky Mountain region. This discovery signaled the start of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. William H. Russell was in Leavenworth, Kansas, when he heard that gold had been found in the Rocky Mountains. Believing that this gold rush was the start of heavy emigration to the region, Russell, together with John S. Jones a former freighting partner, gathered new investors, borrowed money, and organized a stage and express line to run to Denver. The new service was called the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company and transported \\"passengers, mail, freight, and gold\\" to and from the Pike's Peak area on a trail between the Republican and Smoky Hill forks of the Kansas River. The new firm surveyed and laid out a 687-mile route, built twenty seven stations, bought new coaches and mules, and hired enough men to tend to all their holdings. The first trip occurred in March 1859 and took nineteen days, during which they finished constructing the route. Subsequent trips took as little as six days and cost $100.00 for a passenger ticket, $1.00 a pound for express packages, and 25¬¢ for each letter carried. The town of Denver had donated 53 lots to the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company and celebrated the first arrival with an \\"extra\\" published by the Rocky Mountain News. The returning coach to Leavenworth brought with it $3,500 worth of gold and was celebrated with speeches and music. While many people came to the Pike's Peak region, few could afford the cost of the stagecoach and instead traveled on foot or horseback. Russell and Jones wanted to make up the difference by securing a contract to deliver mail for the United States government. On May 11, 1859, the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company purchased Hockaday & Company the firm that owned the postal contract between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Salt Lake City. Hockaday & Company consisted of only a few light stagecoaches and used only seven stations along the route from Missouri to Salt Lake City. The postal contract ran until November 1860 and had been profitable until the post office reduced the frequency of trips and payments for delivery. After consolidating the two companies, Russell and Jones redirected their Denver coaches to Hockaday's more northern route, having run on their original route for less than six weeks. The new route of Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express traveled north to Fort Kearney and then turned south toward Denver at Julesburg, while the Salt Lake City traffic continued on via Fort Laramie and Fort Bridger. The route was divided into three sections; the first section ran from St. Joseph, Missouri, to where the lines split at Julesburg and contained nineteen stations. The second section consisted of the route from Julesburg to South Pass, while the third section ran from South Pass to Salt Lake City. The firm constructed new stations along the route, sixteen to forty miles apart, providing rooms and food for passengers and barns for mule teams. The construction of the new stations and the abandonment of the stations on the original route, were a financial burden on the company. By the fall of 1859, the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company's debts were threatening to collapse the firm. Employees were not being paid, stations ran low on feed, and the firm's creditors were owed more than $525,000. William H. Russell did not partner with Alexander Majors or William Waddell in the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company; they thought it was too early to know whether the emigration would be sustained or merely a passing fad. That, however, did not stop Russell from using the reputation of Russell, Majors, and Waddell to secure credit for the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company. This put a strain on the relationship of the three men especially since they had so recently avoided financial disaster with their War Department contracts. Nevertheless, Majors and Waddell knew that if the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company failed, it could bring down Russell, Majors, and Waddell as well. On October 28, 1859, the three men entered into a new partnership which assumed the assets and debts of the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express Company. Less than a month later, and likely without consulting his partners, Russell named the new firm the Central Overland California & Pike's Peak Express Company or C.O.C. & P.P Express Co. The new name reflected his hope of securing a daily mail route to California along a central route through the Rocky Mountains. (The Southern Route traveled from St. Louis, Missouri, through El Paso, Texas, to San Francisco, California.) Russell headed back to New York in December to raise funds and hold off creditors. On January 27, 1860, he wrote his son: \\"Have determined to establish a Pony Express to Sacramento, California, commencing 3rd of April. Time ten days.\\" Organizing the Pony Express The specifics of who conceived of the idea of a pony express and when are under dispute, but it was Russell, Majors, and Waddell who made the plan work. Russell wanted the Pony Express up and running in a little more than two months after announcing the formation of the Central Overland California & Pike's Peak Express. The firm used their considerable organizational expertise to construct stations, build roads, supply horses and equipment and hire stationmasters, mail agents, and riders in order to open the route from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California, on time. St Joseph was the logical choice for an eastern terminus as the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad line ended there enabling fast communication with the east. The route was divided into five divisions, St. Joseph to Fort Kearny, Fort Kearny to Horseshoe station, Horseshoe Station to Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City to Roberts Creek, and Roberts Creek to Sacramento, each with its own superintendent. While the route followed the same roads as the Leavenworth City & Pike's Peak Express stage line many had to be repaired or upgraded to accommodate the new traffic. Many of the existing stations were re-purposed for the Pony Express but some additional stations were constructed in order to reduce the distance between stations to around 10 miles. Whereas the trail between St. Joseph and Salt Lake City was well known to the firm, the trail from Salt Lake City to Sacramento was almost entirely unknown. At the time George Chorpenning held a federal mail contract between California and Utah which brought in $130,000 per year. His semimonthly service received mail in San Francisco which had been brought in by ship, and freighted it to Salt Lake City. Not willing to share his resources with a competitor, the C.O.C. & P.P. Express Co. was forced to build its own roads and stations to use. The company started building along the Humboldt River in northern Nevada, but when the United States Topographical Engineers surveyed a new route across central Nevada to Genoa they switched routes. The new trail shortened the distance between Utah and California by about 150 miles, and by December 1859 both Ceorge Chorpenning and the C.O.C. & P.P. Express Co. were building stations along the route. The Central Overland California & Pike's Peak Express Company spared no expense in building and equipping these new stations considering the financial strain the company was in at the time. Between 400 and 500 horses were acquired and close to 200 stationmasters and 80 riders were hired to work the route. Home stations, where a rider would rest before returning the other direction, were placed every 75 to 100 miles apart. In April 1860, when the Pony Express made its first run, source state that between 119 and 153 stations were active. The company also set up central offices in major eastern cities, such as New York City and Washington D.C., where mail could be given to a company agent to be delivered to California. On March 17, 1860, an advertisement in the San Francisco Bulletin announced \\"PONY EXPRESS ‚Äî NINE DAYS FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO NEW YORK.\\" Announcements followed in New York and St. Louis. It is estimated that the total investment in the enterprise, including construction, equipment, and provisions, was over $70,000 at the time and that the monthly expenses would be about $5,000. The first run of the Pony Express was scheduled for April 3, 1860. The mail pouch bound for the west, carrying \\"49 letters, 5 private telegrams, and some papers for San Francisco and intermediate points\\", had missed a train connection and the superintendent of the Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad had to order a special locomotive dispatched to deliver the pouch to St. Joseph. The mail arrived two hours late and, after a number of speeches were recited, set off for Sacramento. It took seventy-five ponies to make the first trip from Missouri to California. Each major city along the way celebrated as the Pony Express rider passed through. On April 14, 1860, at about 1 a.m., the Pony Express from St. Joseph arrived in San Francisco. The east-bound rider left San Francisco April 3 and made it to St. Josephs on April 13. The Pony Express was active. In the first month of existence, the Pony Express riders experienced violent weather, harsh terrain, and the physical hardship of being in a saddle for up to 100 miles a day. Despite this, operations ran smoothly. Although the number of letters being sent were not enough to offset the company's expenses, many communities along the line found the service valuable for the news the riders brought and there was talk of rival express operations in the planning stages. On May 11, 1860, Postmaster General Joseph Holt, cancelled the existing mail contract with George Chorpenning and offered it to the C.O.C. & P.P. Express Co instead. The contract paid about $260,000 per year, enough to cover the cost of running the Pony Express. In early May 1860, the Pyramid Lake War started after an incident at the Williams Station along the Pony Express route. For more than three months skirmishes and raids occurred between the white settlers and local Paiute. Pony Express stations were generally easy targets for raids, often in remote locations with ample supplies and few residents. Due to lost personnel, stations, and horses the Pony Express was forced to suspend operations between Carson Valley and Salt Lake City through the end of June. The C.O.C. & P.P. Express Co. rebuilt the destroyed stations and posted up to five guards at each one along this portion of the route. The Pony Express recommenced service at the end of June, though hostilities between the Paiute and settlers didn't cease until August. During the almost two-month disruption, the Pony Express continued to ride between Salt Lake City and St. Joseph. However this route brought in little money. The C.O.C. & P.P. Express Co. had spent upwards of $75,000 to reopen the route to California, much of the money went to fortifying the stations and hiring armed guards. With the company running low on funds a bill was brought before Congress to subsidize the Pony Express for weekly or semi-weekly trips, but it failed to pass. As raids on Pony Express stations continued, Russell, Majors, and Waddell decided that if Congress did not subsidize the route, they would end the enterprise in January 1861. The Post Office Department renewed their St. Joseph to Salt Lake City contract on October 28 and usage of the Pony Express continued to rise through the end of the year. With increasing revenue the firm decided to continue running the Pony Express, albeit at a reduced schedule over the winter. Decline of the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company As the owners and operators of the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company, Russell, Majors, and Waddell were involved in all aspects of setting up and running both the stagecoach lines and the Pony Express. At the same time they continued to run their freighting firm which had been contracted to deliver supplies to the US Army forts scattered around the region. In late 1860 Russell, Majors, and Waddell still had not been paid for their 1857 contract, but with Secretary of War John B. Floyd's personal assurances that they would be paid, they had taken on over $5,000,000 in debt. This debt was on top of the separate debt incurred to set up and run the C.O.C. & P.P. Express Co. In March 1860, Russell, Majors, and Waddell had outfitted a caravan to take supplies to the Army. Due to a number of unforeseen circumstances the caravan was unable to leave until late August. The cost of this delay was high; the men still needed to be paid, the wagon and supplies housed, and the mules and horses fed. Much of the firm's debt came due in mid-summer and they had expected to pay it off with the proceeds from the supply run, but the War Department would only pay upon receipt of goods. The company had to take out more loans to cover the previous debt and further damaged their credit. If the company could secure a government contract for mail, worth $600,000 to $900,000 a year, their financial issues would be solved. With the success of the Pony Express and the fact that the ocean service was set to expire in June 1860, a contract looked promising. However, Congress adjourned without passing a bill for a central overland mail route. William Russell, after an unsuccessful trip to New York to raise more funds, met with Godard Bailey, a relative of Secretary Floyd. Bailey, perhaps fearing that Floyd, as a guarantor of some of Russell, Majors, and Waddell's debt, would be forced to resign if the firm went bankrupt, agreed to help Russell raise money. Bailey let Russell borrow security bonds from the Indian Trust Fund, which Russell used as collateral for more loans. Bailey was not the owner of the bonds and Russell offered a note in their place that he knew was worth nothing; he had committed embezzlement. Russell went back three times to borrow from the Indian Trust Fund. Eventually Bailey's conscience forced him to confess to his part in the scheme and both men were arrested. The outbreak of the Civil War saved the men from prosecution and they were freed on a technicality. The bond scandal had ruined the reputation of Russell, Majors, and Waddell and their freighting firm soon collapsed into bankruptcy. Though Russell, Majors, and Waddell failed, the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company was a separate entity and it continued to operate. When Texas seceded from the Union in 1861, they destroyed the Butterfield Overland Mail line and effectively cut off communication from California to the east over land. The postmaster general could not simply cancel the contract with the Overland Mail Company and so Congress transferred the route north to keep the mail moving through the Union. The C.O.C. & P.P. Express Co. supported this move for a number of reasons. The first reason was that the government would subsidize the Pony Express so it could continue to run until the telegraph reached California. The second reason was that the company couldn't afford to run the line alone in its present state, and neither could Overland Mail; therefore the two companies reached an agreement where the C.O.C. & P.P. Express Co. would subcontract to run the mail from St Joseph to Salt Lake City and Overland Mail would run from Salt Lake City to California using C.O.C. & P.P. Express Co's facilities. Considering the state of the company at the beginning of the year this was a favorable development. With the Civil War begun, the Pony Express was the fastest way to transmit information from east to west and thus found itself in high demand. But the telegraph was catching up quickly, moving east from California and west from Nebraska. By mid August news telegraphed to San Francisco arrived two days before the Pony Express riders. Despite this, the volume of express mail continued to rise. However once the Pony Express stopped receiving government subsidies upon completion of the transcontinental telegraph, the business ran out of cash. Employees dubbed it \\"Clean Out of Cash and Poor Pay\\". On April 26, 1861, Bela M. Hughes was chosen as president and general counsel of the company. The Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company continued to deliver mail from St. Joseph to Salt Lake City for the Overland Mail Company until their contract expired in 1862. At that point Overland Mail put the contract up for bid and it was won by Ben Holladay. On March 21, 1862, Holladay purchased the holdings of the C. O. C. & P. P. Express at public sale for $100,000 and incorporated it into his firm the Overland Stage Company. With the company out of business its facilities in the West Bottoms of Kansas City, Missouri, eventually became the Kansas City Stockyards.

She was initially known for her intense speculative fiction for adults,Steffen Hantke, \\"Kathe Koja\\" in: Richard Bleiler, Ed. Supernatural Fiction Writers: Contemporary Fantasy and Horror. New York: Thomson/Gale, 2003. p. 541-550. but has written young adult novels, the historical fiction Under the Poppy trilogy, and a fictional biography of Christopher Marlowe. Koja is also a prolific author of short stories, including many in collaboration with Barry N. Malzberg. Koja has also collaborated with Carter Scholz. Most of her short fiction remains uncollected. Koja's novels and short stories frequently concern characters who have been in some way marginalized by society, often focusing on the transcendence and/or disintegration which proceeds from this social isolation (as in The Cipher, Bad Brains, \\"Teratisms,\\" The Blue Mirror, etc.). Koja won the Bram Stoker Award and the Locus Award for her first novel The Cipher, and a Deathrealm Award for Strange Angels. Her prose has been described as \\"stunning\\". Koja was born in Detroit, Michigan, the second of two sisters. She began writing when very young, but only became serious about it after attending a Clarion workshop. Koja's literary works have been recognized and highlighted at Michigan State University in their Michigan Writers Series.  Works  In regard to her earlier works, Koja says that the fundamental question at the heart of her stories deal with the philosophy of transcendence. Koja probes in an interview with Dark Echo: ‚Äúwhen we will to be more than we are, what do we do? How do we choose what then to become, and how accomplish that becoming? And after transformation -- what?‚Äù. This theme of transcendence applies to The Cipher, Bad Brains, Strange Angels, Skin, and Kink. Koja says that this transformative transcendence is explored in each of these novels either through a fundamental change of character experienced by a character, or, through the interaction with an actual presence such as the ‚Äúfunhole‚Äù in The Cipher Koja‚Äôs first novel, The Cipher, was originally entitled The Funhole. The editor Jeanne Cavelos published Koja‚Äôs novel through the Dell Abyss line. Dell rejected the original title. On writing for young adults, Koja states that she loves the young adult genre for the fact that as an author, she is granted the ability to re-examine that aspect of life, including the highs and lows of adolescence. Koja describes this period of life as a place where change is inevitable and almost anything can happen, and to Koja that is exciting. In Koja‚Äôs stories, the characters themselves have a close relationship with art. Koja does this because in her personal life and travels, she encounters other writers who use their art as a place of shelter. The art of these individuals, in Koja‚Äôs eyes, are a reflection of themselves. Their art is likened to a mirror. Koja's work is influenced by Shirley Jackson, Flannery O‚ÄôConnor, Carter Scholz, Sylvia Plath. The film Night of the Living Dead also was a big influence (HNR). Awards Koja won the Bram Stoker Award and the Locus Award for her first novel The Cipher, which was also nominated for the Philip K Dick Award. She also won a Deathrealm Award for Strange Angels. Kathe Koja won the Locus Award for Best First Novel as well as the Bram Stoker Award for Best First Horror Novel from the Horror Writers of America. Both awards were received in 1992, and both for Koja‚Äôs Novel, The Cipher. She was also awarded the Humane Societies Kid‚Äôs in Nature‚Äôs Defense honor, and American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Henry Bergh Award, both in 2002, and both for Koja‚Äôs Novel Straydog. Koja is also the recipient of the Children‚Äôs Book Award, International Reading Association, and Aociety of Midland Authors Children‚Äôs Fiction Award, both in 2004, and awards were for her novel Buddha Boy. Kathe Koja noted in her Biography for Macmillan publishing that she is particularly proud of her awards honored by the Humane Society and ASPCA. Koja‚Äôs first novel in 2002, Straydog, received positive reviews and awards. Paula Rohrlick, writing in Kliatt, praised Straydog as a \\"short, swift read ‚Ä¶ packed full of emotion.\\" A critic for Kirkus Reviews added that \\"fans of tales about teen writers, or stories with animal themes, will pant after this.\\" Similarly, a contributor to Publishers Weekly described Straydog as a \\"solid if sometimes familiar tale of a high school misfit\\" that presents teen readers with a \\"compelling and sympathetic\\" protagonist in Rachel. Farida S. Dowler, writing in School Library Journal, noted that Koja's presentation of Rachel's growing \\"friendship with Griffin has romantic tension, but transcends high-school stereotypes,\\" while in Horn Book Jennifer M. Brabander concluded that the novel is a \\"fast but semi-sophisticated read for teens who haven't outgrown dog stories.\\" Praising The Blue Mirror as an \\"eerie, psychologically gripping urban tale\\" similar to the work of author Francesca Lia Block, a Publishers Weekly reviewer added that in her story \\"Koja explores the confusion between infatuation and real love‚Äîin all its cruelty and its redemptive powers.\\" In the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, a reviewer gave special note to Koja's protagonist, noting that \\"Maggy's voice is articulate, controlled, and self-aware, which makes for intriguing reading.\\" Of the novel, Koja noted on her Web site: \\"The Blue Mirror is concerned with vision, the way we see‚Äîor sometimes refuse to see‚Äîwhat's right in front of us, and what can happen when we open our eyes.\\" Personal life Koja lives near Detroit, Michigan, and is married to the illustrator Rick Lieder, who often does her book jackets.

Her father remarried in 1929 to Rosette Citroen (1882‚Äì1943). Her father was murdered at Sobibor extermination camp, age 82. Almost all of her Dutch-Jewish relatives met the same fate. Only a daughter of her sister Bertha survived The Holocaust. Tall and regal in appearance, she began her acting career on stage, traveling across Europe with various theater companies. In 1918, she left World War I-era devastated Europe to settle in New York City in the United States, where she hid her Dutch Jewish ancestry, generally describing herself as a \\"Parisienne\\" and on an information sheet for the Paramount Public Department she wrote that she was born at Versailles on July 12, 1901 (shaving 10 years off her age as well), the daughter of a fictional Maurice Guillaume Goudal, a lawyer.Benham, Charles C. \\"JETTA GOUDAL: The Exotic\\" at www.classicimages.com (September 1999) Career She first appeared on Broadway in 1921, using the stage name Jetta Goudal. After meeting director Sidney Olcott, who encouraged her venture into film acting, she accepted a bit part in his 1922 film production Timothy's Quest. Convinced to move to the West Coast, Goudal appeared in two more Olcott films in the ensuing three years. Goudal's first role in motion pictures came in The Bright Shawl (1923). She quickly earned praise for her film work, especially for her performance in 1925's Salome of the Tenements, a film based on the Anzia Yezierska novel about life in New York's Jewish Lower East Side. Goudal then worked in the Adolph Zukor and Jesse L. Lasky co-production of The Spaniard and her growing fame brought her to the attention of producer/director Cecil B. DeMille. Goudal appeared in several highly successful and acclaimed films for DeMille and became one of the top box office draws of the late 1920s. DeMille later claimed that Goudal was so difficult to work with that he eventually fired her and cancelled their contract. Goudal filed a lawsuit for breach of contract against him and DeMille Pictures Corporation. Although DeMille claimed her conduct had caused numerous and costly production delays, in a landmark ruling, Goudal won the suit when DeMille was unwilling to provide his studio's financial records to support his claim of financial losses. Goudal appeared in 1928's The Cardboard Lover, produced by William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies. In 1929, she starred in Lady of the Pavements, directed by D.W. Griffith, and in 1930, Jacques Feyder directed Goudal in her only French language film, a made-in- Hollywood production titled Le Spectre vert. Later career Because of her audaciousness in suing DeMille and her high-profile activism in the Actors' Equity Association campaign for the theatre and film industry to accept a closed shop, some of the Hollywood studios refused to employ Goudal. In 1932, at age forty-one, she made her last screen appearance in a talkie, co-starring with Will Rogers in the Fox Film Corporation production of Business and Pleasure. Personal life and death In 1930, she married Harold Grieve, an art director and founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. When her film career ended, she joined Grieve in running a successful interior design business. They remained married until her death in 1985 in Los Angeles.\\"Silent Film Actress Jetta Goudal Dies.\\" Los Angeles Times. January 16, 1985, Page OC13. She is interred next to her husband in a private room at the Great Mausoleum, Sanctuary of the Angels, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. In 1960, for recognition of Goudal's contribution to the motion picture industry, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6333 Hollywood Blvd. On April 19, 2019, the City council of Amsterdam renamed bridge 771, previously without a name, the Jetta Goudalbridge. Early 2020 the name tag was placed. Holocaust Jetta Goudal lost nearly all her relatives in the Holocaust. Her sister Bertha died in 1945 in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, Bertha's husband Nathan Beffie died at the same place in 1944. Jetta's nephew Eduard Beffie (Berta's son) was killed at Sobib√≥r extermination camp. Jetta Goudal's stepmother, Rosette Citroen, was also killed at Sobibor in 1943. Only Bertha's daughter, Geertruida (Truus) Beffie survived the war and died in 2013 in Pennsylvania, United States.

A capital of Gmina Dolsk within the ≈örem County, the town is a minor centre of trade and commerce. The town is located between two lakes, the Dolskie Wielkie and Dolskie Ma≈Çe, both deriving their names from the name of the town. Geographically, the town lies in the Leszczy≈Ñska Uplands in Greater Poland, close to its border with Lower Silesia. History The town was first mentioned in one of the first documents written partially in the Polish language, that is the Bull of Gniezno of 1136. Back then it was a private property of the Bishops of Gniezno. In the mid-13th century the town was transferred to the Bishops of Pozna≈Ñ, who remained the sole owners of the area until after the Partitions of Poland. Located at the trade route linking Pozna≈Ñ with Wroc≈Çaw, the town drew significant income from the traders and merchants, who were obliged to sell their merchandise at the local market before proceeding down the trade route. In 1359 king Casimir III granted the town with ≈öroda Law, a local variant of the famous Magdeburg Law. In 1793 Dolsk was annexed by Prussia in the Second Partition of Poland, and in 1797 it was confiscated by the Prussian authorities and gradually fell into dismay. In 1807 regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and in 1815 reannexed by Prussia. The town was restored to Poland, after the country regained independence in 1918 following World War I. During World War II the town was under German occupation and in the mass executions carried out by the occupiers, 10 people from Dolsk and the surrounding areas were shot. The mayor of Dolsk, J√≥zef Burdajewicz, was murdered in a public execution of 17 Poles, carried out by the German Einsatzgruppe VI on October 20, 1939 in the nearby town of KsiƒÖ≈º Wielkopolski.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939.

Sights Currently the town is experiencing a period of growth due to increase in tourist traffic. Among the most notable tourist attractions are three local churches: St. Michael's church (circa 1460, burnt and rebuilt in 1790, one of the most notable pieces of late Gothic architecture in the area), Baroque St. Laurentius' church (17th century) and Holy Spirit's church (17th century wooden church, formerly a chapel for the local hospital). The area around the town is a mosaic of various types of landscape, mostly formed during the glacial age. Among the most notable features are dense forests, several lakes and healthy turf deposits.

It has been removed. European Architecture Student Assembly (EASA) was founded in 1981 by architect students like Geoff Haslam and Richard Murphy and is closely related to the Winterschool concept, which organises similar events for UK students of architecture. EASA takes place each summer in a different country, with the event usually lasting two weeks. It is organised by students of architecture for students of architecture and the concept is operated on a cooperative basis. In fall at INCM, Intermediate National Contact Meeting, the location for EASA is decided one and a half years in advance. Typically 400 students take part in the event and engage in workshops, exhibitions, lectures and social events loosely based around a specific theme. These events are run by a combination of academics and students and encompass a wide variety of activities with a greater or lesser relationship to architecture. The event is funded through a combination of attendance fees (which vary for each country based upon ability to pay), grants and sponsorship, all arranged by the organising committee for each event. EASA has little or no formal structure in that each event is organised as a unique occurrence - though a system of National Contacts (NCs) ensures that the event each year is well supported. NCs also typically meet once a year to discuss the previous EASA and prepare for the next. Students come from over 40 European countries to the event each year. Recent Assemblies have seen students participating from the US, India and Central American countries.

Like the basic idea of the EASA, a SESAM can give an addition and/or alternative to the education of the students. The independence and off-university-character creates an informal atmosphere. The SESAM is a workshop with a small number of participants. Through this concentrated character the SESAM allows to work on a tight theme. After a number of similar events in the year before in Italy, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, etc., the first EASA workshop with the name SESAM was realized 1992 in Vilafam√©s (Valencia, Spain, October 1992, 50 participants). SESAM2007 was held in Aarhus, Denmark on 23‚Äì25 November 2007. The next scheduled SESAM meeting is due to take place in 2021 in Slavutych, Ukraine. =Pivo SESAM = The event is an excuse to meet with the other members of the network. It usually takes place during the New Year celebrations. EASA Newspaper: Umbrella Each year, during EASA, one of the workshops is dedicated to cover the event by reporting about events and workshops in a newspaper-like fashion. This workshop and hence the newspaper is typically called umbrella, or variation of the local word for umbrella. This newspaper is usually published on a daily basis and has been an integral part of EASA since the early 1980s. In recent years, The Umbrella Workshop has also embraced new media, and has run EASA TV during the event. In 2009 EASA TV was a workshop of its own for the first time, but with integral co-operation with Umbrella. EASA TV EASA.TV tries to cover as much of the assembly as possible and the material is then edited, screened on site at the assembly and uploaded online. The participants will learn how to plan episodes, write scripts, draw storyboards, record with DSLR cameras and edit and export with software such as Adobe Premiere Pro. But most of all they will get the chance to document the very essence of EASA, the EASA spirit. Since 2007 EASA FM EASA FM is a temporary radio station that was started in EASA011, Cadiz/Spain.

The name guitar fiddle is intended to emphasize the fact that the instrument in the shape of the guitar, which during the Middle Ages represented the most perfect principle of construction for stringed instruments with necks, adopted at a certain period the use of the bow from instruments of a less perfect type, the rebab and its hybrids. The use of the bow with the guitar entailed certain constructive changes in the instrument: the large central rose sound hole was replaced by lateral holes of various shapes; the flat bridge, suitable for instruments whose strings were plucked, gave place to the arched bridge required in order to enable the bow to vibrate each string separately; the arched bridge, by raising the strings higher above the sounding board, made the stopping of strings on the neck extremely difficult if not impossible; this matter was adjusted by the addition of a fingerboard of suitable shape and dimensions (fig. 1). At this stage the guitar fiddle possesses the essential features of the violin, and may justly claim to be its immediate predecessor cites not so much through the viols which were the outcome of the Minnesinger fiddle with sloping shoulders, as through the intermediary of the Italian lyra, a guitar-shaped bowed instrument with from 7 to 12 strings. From such evidence as we now possess, it would seem that the evolution of the early guitar with a neck from the Greek cithara took place under Greek influence in the Christian East. The various stages of this transition have been definitely established by the remarkable miniatures of the Utrecht Psalter. cites where the subject is discussed and illustrated, where the subject is discussed and illustrated. Two kinds of citharas are shown: the antique rectangular, cites , and notes: see pl. vi. (2) to the right centre. and the later design with rounded body having at the point where the arms are added indications of the waist or incurvations characteristic of the outline of the Spanish guitar. cites , and notes: see pl. iii. centre and figs. 118 and 119. The first stage in the transition is shown by a cithara or rotta cites , and notes: see fig. 117, p. 341, and figs. 172 and 116. in which arms and transverse bar are replaced by a kind of frame repeating the outline of the body and thus completing the second lobe of the Spanish guitar. The next stages in the transition are concerned with the addition of a neck cites , and notes: see fig. 121, p. 246, figs. 122, 123, 125 and 126 pi. iii. vi. (1) and (2). and of frets. cites , and notes: see fig. 126, p. 350, and pl. iii. right centre. All these instruments are twanged by the fingers. One may conclude that the use of the bow was either unknown at this time (c. 6th century), or that it was still confined to instruments of the rebab type. The earliest known representation of a guitar fiddle complete with bow cites , and notes: see fig. 173, p. 448. (fig. 2) occurs in a Greek Psalter written and illuminated in Caesarea by the archpriest Theodore in 1066 (British Library, Add. MS. 19352). Instances of perfect guitar fiddles abound in the 13th century MSS. and monuments, as for instance in a picture by Cimabue (1240‚Äì1302), in the Pitti Gallery in Florence. cites , and notes: see fig. 205, p. 480. An evolution on parallel lines appears also to have taken place from the antique rectangular cithara notes: See Museo Pio Clementino, by Ennio Quirino Visconti (Milan, 1818). of the citharoedes, which was a favourite in Romano-Christian art. notes: see for example Georgics, iv. 471-475 in the Vatican Virgil (Cod. 3225), in facsimile (Rome, 1899) (British Museum press- mark 8, tab. f. vol. ii.). In this case examples illustrative of the transitions are found represented in great variety in Europe. The old German rotta notes: This rotta was found in an Alemannic tomb of the 4th to the 7th centuries at Oberflacht in the Black Forest. A facsimile is preserved in the collection of the Kgl. Hochschule, Berlin, illustrations in \\"Grabfunde am Berge Lupfen bei Oberflacht, 1846\\", Jahresberichte d. W√ºrttemb. Altertums- Vereins, iii.

Vesp. A. i. British Museum the other \\"A Commentary on the Psalms by Cassiodorus manu Bedae\\" of the 8th century preserved in the Cathedral Library at Durham Notes: Reproductions of both miniatures are to be found in Professor J. O. Westwood's Facsimiles of the Miniatures and Ornaments of Anglo-Saxon and Irish MSS. (London, 1868). form examples of the first stage of transition. From such types as these the rectangular crwth or crowd was evolved by the addition of a fingerboard and the reduction in the number of strings, which follows as a natural consequence as soon as an extended compass can be obtained by stopping the strings. By the addition of a neck we obtain the clue to the origin of rectangular citterns with rounded corners and of certain instruments played with the bow whose bodies or sound chests have an outline based upon the rectangle with various modifications. We may not look upon this type of guitar fiddle as due entirely to western or southern European initiative; its origin like that of the type approximating to the violin is evidently Byzantine.

It was named in imitation of the Golden Gate of Constantinople. The structure was dismantled in the Middle Ages, leaving few vestiges of its existence. It was rebuilt completely by the Soviet authorities in 1982, though no images of the original gates have survived. The decision has been immensely controversial because there were many competing reconstructions of what the original gate might have looked like.http://www.ukraine.com/sights/golden-gate-of-kiev/ The rebuilt structure on the corner of Volodymyr street and Yaroslaviv Val Street contains a branch of the National Sanctuary \\"Sophia of Kyiv\\" museum.

History Boles≈Çaw I of Poland and Sviatopolk the Accursed at Kyiv, in a legendary moment of hitting the Golden Gate with the Szczerbiec sword. Painting by Jan Matejko Modern history accepts this gateway as one of three constructed by Yaroslav the Wise. The golden gates were built in 1017-1024 (6545 by the Byzantine calendar) at about the same time the Saint Sophia Cathedral was erected. Mentions of an older construction, such as the one presented on a painting by Jan Matejko of king Boles≈Çaw I of Poland striking the Golden Gate with his sword during the intervention in the Kyivan succession crisis in 1018, it is now regarded a legend. Originally named simply the Southern Gate, it was one of the three main entrances to the walled city, along with the Ladski and Zhydivski (Polish and Jewish) Gates.In the Ipatiev Chronicles of that period (1146-1151) mention is frequently made of the \\"Jewish gate\\" in Kyiv. In 1124, the Jewish quarter of Kyiv was destroyed by fire. [in:] S. M. Dubnow, Simon Dubnow, Israel Friedlaender. History of the Jews in Russia and Poland. 2001. p. 10 The last two have not survived. The stone fortifications stretched for only 3.5 km.

From there, the moat followed what is now Kostyol Street, skirting St. Michael's Monastery and continuing along today's Zhytomyr Street toward the Jewish Gates (at Lviv Square). From there, the fortification stretched what is now Yaroslaviv Val (\\"Yaroslav's Rampart\\") Street back to the Southern Gate. In the 1970s, prior to reconstruction, the Golden Gate still retained its traditional shape, a shape that had been remembered for centuries. Later, the Southern Gate became known as the Great Gate of Kyiv. After the Blahovist Church (Church of the Annunciation) was built next to the gate, its golden domes became a prominent landmark easily visible from outside the city. Since then, the gateway has been referred to as the Golden Gate of Kyiv. The gate's passageway was about high and wide. For almost half a millennium, it served as the city's Triumphal Arch, a prominent symbol of Kyiv. Reputedly, it was modeled on the Golden Gate of Constantinople. Later, a similar name was given to the gates of Vladimir city where one of the Monomakh's descendants, Andrei I Bogolyubsky, established his own state, the Grand Duchy of Vladimir. In 1240, the gate was partially destroyed by Batu Khan's Golden Horde.The next day the Mongols surrounded the city, but they concentrated their catapults against Kyiv's obvious weak point‚Äîthe battlements that flanked the Polish Gate, the only part of the city walls constructed of wood. [in:] Thomas J. Craughwell . The Rise and Fall of the Second Largest Empire in History. 2010. page 184 It remained as a gate to the city (often used for ceremonies) through the eighteenth century, although it gradually fell into ruins. In 1832, Metropolitan Eugenius had the ruins excavated and an initial survey for their conservation was undertaken. Further works in the 1970s added an adjacent pavilion, housing a museum of the gate. In the museum, visitors can learn about the history of construction of the Golden gate as well as ancient Kyiv. The view of the gate from the \\"city side\\" In 1982, the gate was completely reconstructed for the 1500th anniversary of Kyiv, though this was challenged. Some art historians called for this reconstruction to be demolished and for the ruins of the original gate to be exposed to public view. In 1989, with the expansion of the Kyiv Metro, Zoloti Vorota station was opened nearby to the landmark. Its architectural assemble is based on the internal decorations of ancient Ruthenian churches. In 1997, the monument to Yaroslav the Wise was unveiled near the west end face of the Golden Gate. It is an enlarged bronze copy of an experimental figuring by Kavaleridze. Church above the passage In addition to mentioning the construction of the church above the passage of the Golden Gate in the chronicle, it is also mentioned in Metropolitan Ilarion's \\"Word of Law and Grace\\" of the Golden Gate. Interior of Golden Gate Gate Church had to serve \\"the heavenly protection of the city\\", but was also a regular church - people arrived to pray there. The bell chapel is reproduced in the form of a three- nave four-pillar single-dome temple. In the architectural decoration of the facades used ornaments from the brick, typical for the ancient buildings of that period. The floor of the church is decorated with a mosaic, the picture of which is based on the ancient floor design of Saint Sophia's Cathedral in Kyiv. Reconstruction of the monument reproduces the segments of the shaft adjoining to the gate. On the outside they have suspended slopes. At the top of the shaft there are wooden bunks. On the ends conventionally shown internal structures. From the city side on the facade there are warehouses. Inside the restored shaft segments there is an exposition of the Museum of the Golden Gate and the stairs leading to the balcony, from which a magnificent panorama of the city is visible.

After serving in both houses of the Pennsylvania legislature, he represented Pennsylvania in the United States Senate from 1897 until his death in 1921. Penrose was the fourth political boss of the Pennsylvania Republican political machine, following Simon Cameron, Donald Cameron, and Matthew Quay. Penrose was the longest-serving Pennsylvania Senator until Arlen Specter surpassed his record in 2005. Early life Born into a prominent Old Philadelphian family of Cornish descent,White, G. Pawley, A Handbook of Cornish Surnames. (Boies Penrose mentioned by name) he was a grandson of Speaker of the Pennsylvania Senate Charles B. Penrose and brother of gynecologist Charles Bingham Penrose and mining entrepreneurs Richard and Spencer. He was a descendant of the prominent Biddle family of Philadelphia. Penrose graduated second in his class from Harvard University in 1881. After reading the law with an established firm, he was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar in 1883. State politics Although Penrose wrote two books on political reform, he joined the political machine of Matthew Quay, a Pennsylvania Republican political boss. He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1884, and was elected to the Pennsylvania Senate for the 6th district in 1886. He served as president pro tempore from 1889 to 1891. Penrose served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1884 to 1886 and as a member of the Pennsylvania Senate for the 6th district from 1887 to 1897. He was President Pro Tempore from 1889 to 1891. Penrose was elected Chairman of the State Republican Party in 1903, succeeding fellow Senator Matthew Quay. A year later, Quay died, and Penrose was appointed to succeed him as the state's Republican National Committeeman. He quickly became a power broker in the state, enabling figures like Richard Baldwin to advance through loyalty to his organization.Earl C. Kaylor, Jr., Martin Grove Brumbaugh: A Pennsylvanian's Odyssey from Sainted Schoolman to Bedeviled World War I Governor, 1862-1930 (Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1996), p. 300. In 1912, Penrose was forced out of power by the progressive faction of the party led by William Flinn, in 1912. Penrose did not stand for re-election to his national committee post. However, following Flinn's departure from the party to support Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party, Penrose was able to garner enough support to return to his post as national committeeman and would remain in the position until his death.  U.S. Senator  In 1897, the state legislature elected Penrose to the United States Senate over John Wanamaker. He left his office as a State Senator that year to take the new position. Penrose was a dominant member of the Senate Finance Committee and supported high protective tariffs. He had also served on the United States Senate Committee on Banking, United States Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, United States Senate Committee on Post Office and Post Roads, United States Senate Committee on Education and Labor, and United States Senate Committee on Immigration.\\"Senator Boies Penrose Dead,\\" Indianapolis Sunday Star, 1922-01-01 at p. 1, retrieved 2012-10-15. One of Penrose's most important legislative actions was adding the \\"oil depletion allowance\\" to the Revenue Act of 1913. Penrose consistently supported \\"pro-business\\" policies, and opposed labor reform and women's rights. In the 1912 presidential election, Penrose strongly supported incumbent President William Howard Taft over former President Theodore Roosevelt. After a campaign that consisted of heavy attacks on Penrose, Roosevelt won the state in the 1912 election, although Democrat Woodrow Wilson won the national vote. Penrose was also a major supporter of Warren Harding, and helped the Ohio Senator win the 1920 Republican nomination. Penrose's role in Harding's election helped earn Pennsylvanian Andrew W. Mellon the role of Secretary of the Treasury. In 1914, Penrose faced his first direct election (following the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment). He publicly campaigned for the first time in his life and defeated Democrat A. Mitchell Palmer and Progressive Gifford Pinchot. In November 1915, Penrose accompanied the Liberty Bell on its nationwide tour returning to Pennsylvania from the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco; Penrose accompanied the bell to New Orleans and then to Philadelphia. The Liberty Bell has not been moved from Pennsylvania since.  Personal life and business  Penrose was an avid outdoorsman and took pleasure in mountain exploration and big-game hunting. Penrose climbed and named at least two mountains: one in Montana and another in the Dickson Range in the Bridge River Country of British Columbia. The Senator was a large, heavy man and, according to his hunting guide, W.G. (Bill) Manson, they had to spend a lot of time to find a horse hop big enough to carry Penrose and his custom saddle. The horse was called \\"Senator.\\" After Penrose stopped riding, the horse was retired to pasture because no standard saddle would fit him. In 1903 Boies, along with his brothers and father, invested in the formation of the Utah Copper Company. Death and legacy Boies Penrose tombstone in Laurel Hill Cemetery Penrose died in his Wardman Park penthouse suite in Washington, D.C. in the last hour of 1921, after suffering a pulmonary thrombosis. He was buried in the family grave section in the Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. Following Penrose's death, his lieutenant Joseph Grundy became one of the leaders of the Republican machine, but no one boss dominated the party like Penrose and his predecessors had. A statue of Penrose has been in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's Capitol Park since September 1930.

The name means The Suspended Odes or The Hanging Poems, the traditional explanation being that these poems were hung on or in the Kaaba in Mecca, while scholars have also suggested that the hanging is figurative, as if the poems \\"hang\\" in the reader's mind. Along with the Mufaddaliyat, Jamharat Ash'ar al-Arab and Asma'iyyat, the Mu'allaqƒÅt are considered the primary source for early Arabic poetry. History =Compilation= The original compiler of the poems may have been Hammad al-Rawiya (8th century). The grammarian Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Nahhas (d. 949 CE) says in his commentary on the Mu'allaqat: \\"The true view of the matter is this: when Hammad al-Rawiya saw how little men cared for poetry, he collected these seven pieces, urged people to study them, and said to them: 'These are the [poems] of renown.'\\" Orfali suggests that the connection is \\"the multi-thematic qa·π£idƒÅh form\\". Hammad was a Persian by descent, but a client of the Arab tribe, Bakr ibn Wa'il. For this reason, some suppose he not only received into the collection a poem of the famous poet Tarafa, of the tribe of Bakr, but also that of another Bakrite, Harith. The latter had been a prominent chieftain, while his poem could serve as a counterpoise to Harith's contemporary 'Amr, chief of the Taghlib, the rival tribe of the Bakr. 'Amr praises the Taghlib in glowing terms: Harith, in a similar vein, extols the Bakr ancestors of Hammad's patrons. The collection appears to have consisted of the same seven poems which are found in modern editions, composed respectively by Imru' al-Qais, Tarafa, Zuhayr, Labƒ´d, 'Antara Ibn Shaddad, 'Amr ibn Kulthum, and Harith ibn Hilliza. These are enumerated both by Ibn Abd Rabbih (860-940 CE), and, on the authority of the older philologists, by Nahhas; and all subsequent commentators seem to follow them. There is, however, evidence of the existence, at an early period, of a slightly different arrangement. The Jamharat Ash'ar al-Arab claims that two of the most competent ancient authorities on Arabic poetry, al-Mufaddal (d. c. 790) and Abu  øUbaidah (d. 824 CE), had already assigned to the \\"Seven\\" (i.e. \\"the seven Mu'allaqat\\") a poem each of al-Nabigha and al-A'sha in place of those of 'Antara and Harith. The learned Ibn Qutaiba (9th century), in his book Of Poetry and Poets, mentions as belonging to the \\"Seven\\" not only the poem of 'Amr, which has been reckoned among the Mu'allaqat (ed. de Goeje, p. 120), but also a poem of 'Abid ibn al-Abras (ibid. 144). The variance in the lists of poets may have been due to tribal rivalries. Nabigha and A'sha were more famous than any of the poets represented in the Mu'allaqat, with the exception of Imru' al-Qais, so it could be that scholars of a somewhat later date appended a poem by each of these to the Mu'allaqat, without intending by this to make them an integral part of that work. This is indicated by the introductory words of Yahya ibn Ali Tibrizi (d. 1109 C.E.) to his commentary on the Mu'allaqat. Appended to this he gives a commentary to a poem of Nabigha, to one of A'sha, and moreover one to that poem of 'Abid which Ibn Qutaiba had counted among the seven. Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406 CE), in his Muqaddimah, speaks of nine Mu'allaqat, but this was probably due to a misunderstanding. =The hanging of the poems= Ibn Abd Rabbih in the Al- øIqd al-Farƒ´d (\\"The Precious Necklace\\") states, \\"The Arabs had such an interest in poetry, and valued it so highly, that they took seven long pieces selected from the ancient poetry, wrote them in gold on pieces of Coptic linen folded up, and hung them up (allaqat) [sic] on the curtains which covered the Kaaba. Hence we speak of 'the golden poem of Imru' al-Qais,' 'the golden poem of Zuhayr.' The number of the golden poems is seven; they are also called 'the suspended' (al-Mu ªallaqƒÅt).\\" Similar statements are found in later Arabic works. Al-Nahhas, however, denied this in his commentary on the Mu ªallaqƒÅt: \\"As for the assertion that they were hung up in the Kaaba, it is not known to any of those who have handed down ancient poems.\\" No trace of this story is found in early sources about Mecca or the customs of pre-Islamic Arabia. There are records of other items being hung in the Kaaba: a Meccan was reported to have hung a spoil of battle on the Kaaba (Ibn Hisham, ed. Wiistenfeld, p. 431), and an important document may have been deposited there (ibid. p. 230). A passage of late origin claims that the poems were taken down after the capture of Mecca by the Prophet (De Sacy, Chrestom. ii. 480), but the event is not otherwise attested. While the poems were almost certainly transmitted orally before being recorded in writing, scholars such as Brown see no reason why significant change through the oral transmission should exist‚Äîbecause the poems were held in high regard, there would be more social pressure to repeat them precisely. Another version of the legend, also given by Nahhas, is as follows: However, there was no king of all the Arabs, and it is unlikely that any Arabian king attended the fair at Okaz. The story that the poems were written in gold originated in the name \\"the golden poems\\" (literally \\"the gilded\\"), a figurative expression for excellence. The designation \\"suspended\\" may be interpreted in the same way, referring to those (poems) which have been raised, on account of their value, to a specially honourable position. Another derivative of the same root is  ªilq, \\"precious thing.\\" Another name sometimes used for these poems is assumut, \\"strings of pearls\\". From this usage it became popular, even in ordinary prose, to refer to speech in rhythmical form as naqm \\"to string pearls.\\" The selection of these seven poems is unlikely to have been the work of the ancient Arabs, but rather some one writing at a later date. Another hypothesis is given by Robson, who argues that the title was given by Hammad to indicate that the poems are \\"suspended\\" from their rightful place‚Äîthat is, like a disrespected wife denied her place by a husband of multiple wives (Qu'ran 4.128), the poems are denied their proper place: a diwan. Regardless of meaning, most scholars doubt the poems were physically hung at the Kaaba. Authorship =The seven renowned ones= The lives of these poets were spread over a period of more than a hundred years. The earliest of the seven was Imru' al-Qais, regarded by many as the most illustrious of Arabian Mu ªallaqah poets. His exact date cannot be determined; but probably the best part of his career fell within the midst of the sixth century. He was a scion of the royal house of the tribe Kindah, which lost its power at the death of its king, Harith ibn  ªAmr, in the year 529. The poet's royal father, Hojr, by some accounts a son of this Harith, was killed by a Bedouin tribe, the Banu Asad ibn Khuzaymah. The son led an adventurous life as a refugee, now with one tribe, now with another, and appears to have died young. A contemporary of Imru ª al-Qais was Abid ibn al-Abras, one poem of whose is by some authorities reckoned among the collection. The Mu ªallaqah of 'Amr ibn Kulthum hurls defiance against the king of al-Hirah, 'Amr III ibn al- Mundhir, who reigned from the summer of 554 until 568 or 569, and was afterwards killed by the poet. This prince is also addressed by Harith in his Mu ªallaqa. Of Tarafa, a few satirical verses have been preserved, directed against this same king. This agrees with the fact that a grandson of the Qais ibn Khalid, mentioned as a rich and influential man in Tarafa's Mu ªallaqah (v. 80 or 81), figured at the time of the Battle of Dhi Qar, in which the tribe Bakr routed a Persian army. This battle falls about 610 CE. The Mu ªallaqah of Antarah ibn Shaddad and that of Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma contain allusions to the feuds of the kindred tribes Banu Abs and Banu Dhubyan. Famous as these contests were, their time cannot accurately be ascertained. But the date of the two poets can be approximately determined from other data. Ka'b bin Zuhayr, composed first a satire, and then, in the year 630, a eulogy on the Prophet; another son, Bujair, had begun, somewhat sooner, to celebrate Muhammad. Antara killed the grandfather of Ahnaf ibn Qais, who died at an advanced age in 686 or 687; he outlived 'Abdallah ibn Simma, whose brother Duraid was old when he died in battle against Muhammad's army (early in 630 CE); and he had communications with Ward, whose son, the poet Urwah ibn al- Ward, may perhaps have survived the flight of Muhammad to Medina. From these indications, German scholar Theodor N√∂ldeke placed the productive period of both poets in the end of the 6th century. The historical background of Antara's Mu ªallaqat lies somewhat earlier than that of Zuhayr's. The poems of 'Alqama ibn 'Abada and Al-Nabigha are from the same period. In Al-Nabigha's poem sometimes reckoned as a Mu ªallaqah, he addresses himself to the king of al-Hirah, al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir, who reigned in the two last decades of the sixth century. The same king is mentioned as a contemporary in one of poems of  ªAlqama. The poem of al-A'sha, sometimes added to the Mu ªallaqƒÅt, contains an allusion to the battle of Dhi Qar (under the name \\"Battle of Hinw\\", v. 62). This poet, lived to compose a poem in honour of Muhammad, and died not long before 630 CE. Labƒ´d is the only one of these poets who converted to Islam. His Mu ªallaqa, however, like almost all his other poetical works, belongs to the pre-Islamic period. He may have lived until 661 or later. =Hammad Ar-Rawiya's seven poets= #Imru' al-Qais #Labƒ´d #Tarafa #Zuhayr ibn Abi Sulma #Antara Ibn Shaddad #Amr ibn Kulthum #Harith ibn Hilliza =Poets sometimes numbered amongst the seven= #Al-Nabigha #al-A'sha #'Abid ibn al-Abras The poems The seven Mu'allaqat, and also the poems appended to them, represent almost every type of ancient Arabian poetry. Tarafa's poem includes a long, anatomically exact description of his camel, common in pre- Islamic poetry. The Mu'allaqat of 'Amr and Harith contain fakhr (boasting) about the splendors of their tribe. The song of Zuhayr is presented as the \\"practical wisdom of a sober man of the world.\\" The other poems are fairly typical examples of the customary qasida, the long poem of ancient Arabia. The Mu'allaqat of 'Antara has a warlike tone, in contrast to the peaceful themes of Labid. There is a high degree of uniformity in the Mu'allaqat. The poets use a strict metrical system. The only poem which shows unusual metrical freedom is the song of 'Abid. However, Abid's contemporary Imru' al-Qais, in a poem which in other respects also exhibits certain coincidences with that of 'Abid, also shows considerable licence in the use of the same rare metre. The deviations from the schema in 'Abid may be due to incorrect transmission by compilers who failed to grasp the metre. The other poems ascribed to 'Abid, together with all the rest attributed to Imru' al-Qais, are constructed in precise accord with the metrical canons. The last poet in the Mu'allaqat is Hammad, the compiler of the Mu'allaqat. Hammad may have altered the text and transposed some verses. Some of the Mu'allaqat have several preambles: so, especially, that of 'Amr, the first eight verses of which belong not to the poem, but to another poet. Some of the poems exhibit great divergences (both in the order and number of the verses and in textual details) from their exemplars in other poetic anthologies. This is particularly the case with the oldest Mu'allaqat, that of Imru' al-Qais. According to N√∂ldeke, the most accurate text is that of the latest Mu'allaqat, the song of Labid. The Mu'allaqat exist in many manuscripts, some with old commentaries. Printed editions include that of Charles James Lyall with the commentary of Tibrizi (Calcutta, 1894).

The road was named for frontiersman Stephen Meek, who was hired to lead the first wagon train along it in 1845. The journey was a particularly hard one, and many of the pioneers lost their lives. Starting where the Oregon Trail leaves the Snake River Plain and heads northwest toward the Columbia River Gorge (the general route of modern Interstate 84), Meek's party intended to instead head west across the Oregon High Desert, straight to the Willamette Valley. They left the main trail at Vale, Oregon and followed the Malheur River to head into the Harney Basin. They then turned west towards Wagontire Mountain and northwest to the south fork of the Crooked River. At this point, due to hardship, the party split into two groups, each of which found the Deschutes River. The two groups reunited north of where the Crooked River empties into the Deschutes and, deflecting from their original westward purpose, followed the river to the Columbia and rejoined the Oregon Trail at The Dalles. In 1853, the Elliott Cutoff was established, completing Meek's purpose by turning upstream at the Deschutes River for 30 miles and then crossing the Cascade Mountains at Willamette Pass. Stephen Meek The grave of Sarah \\"Sally\\" King Chambers. The caption reads \\"Mrs. S Chambers Sep 3rd 1845\\". Ruts of Meek's and Elliott's wagons near Westfall, Oregon Emigrants marked their path on this juniper limb, found southeast of present-day Redmond, Oregon. The limb is now on display in the Deschutes County Museum. Sherar's Bridge was later built where some in Meek's wagon train built an elaborate pulley system to get people and wagons across the Deschutes River. Others tied ropes across the river banks about two miles upstream and used their wagon box as a boat to cross the swift current. History In 1845, there were rumors circulating among the emigrants on the Oregon Trail that the Walla Walla and Cayuse Indians might possibly attack the settlers in the Blue Mountains of Oregon or along the Columbia River. Reports of threats came in conjunction with the murder of two Frenchmen in the area.Keith Clark and Lowell Tiller. Terrible Trail: The Meek Cutoff, 1845, (Bend, OR: Maverick Publications Inc., 1966), 14-19. Stephen Meek, the older brother of Joe Meek, was an experienced fur trapper and explorer who made his living as a wagon train guide. Meek was unemployed at the time but was considered to be someone who was familiar with eastern Oregon. When he offered the emigrants an alternate route to avoid the Blue Mountains many decided to follow him.Clark and Tiller. Terrible Trail, p. xvii-xx, 8‚Äì12. Some 200 wagons and 1,000 people turned off the primary Oregon Trail at Vale and followed Meek into the Oregon desert, where no wagons had traveled before. =Blazing a new trail= Meek led the wagon train southwest through the Malheur Mountains. The party followed the Malheur River for the first two days but were then forced into the hill country. As they progressed the road became stonier. It was so hard on the oxen that several died each day.Clark and Tiller. Terrible Trail, p. 25‚Äì28. Some of the emigrants were not doing well, especially those who were already sick when the train took the cutoff. Just west of Castle Rock and along the North Fork of the Malheur River, Rowland Chambers' wife Sarah, the Captain's daughter and a young mother of two small children, was now critically ill, having contracted camp fever earlier in the journey. \\"Everything possible was done to ease her distress as she lay in the wagon hovering between life and death but alas, to no avail. Sarah breathed her last breath at this camp and was laid to rest beneath the sagebrush.\\"Donna Wojcik Montgomery, The Brazen Overlanders of 1845. Bowie Maryland: Heritage Books, Inc., 1992 (Revised Edition), First publication was in 1976 by Donna Wojcik, p. 255. The next day the grieving husband was left behind with a horse as the train continued to journey on. He went down to the river and found a native stone that he smoothed, then carved this inscription: \\"Mrs. S Chambers, Sep 3rd 1845.\\" It remains one of the few Oregon Trail gravestones in existence. The very next day the train experienced its most difficult ascent. In order to reach a ridge west of the North Fork of the Malheur River, the emigrants were forced to climb a steep, narrow ravine choked with boulders. One emigrant wrote about moving \\"ten thousand stones\\" in order to make a roadbed. Some of the wagons were damaged during the 1,000-foot climb, but they were soon repaired and the wagons continued over the hill and down to Cottonwood Creek.Robert G. Boyd, Wandering Wagons: Meek's Lost Emigrants of 1845 (Bend, OR: The High Desert Museum), p. 37. The train continued over mountains until it finally came down East Cow Creek into the Harney Basin, in a region known today as the Oregon High Desert. The expression on Meek's face \\"changed to one of complete bewilderment, as if he were seeing the country for the first time.\\"Montgomery, The Brazen Overlanders of 1845, p. 260. When trapping in this area 10 years prior, the alkaline lakes had flooded a large portion of the valley. But now it was a drought year, the lakes were small and everything looked different. They continued south along the Silvies River and out into the lakebed, where they turned west. As they made their way to Silver Creek there were some in the forward company who insisted they continue west to find a pass over the Cascades. Meek wanted to follow Silver Creek to the north, but they refused to follow him. On September 11, 1845, James Field wrote in his diary: > It was his intention to follow down Crooked river to the Deschutes and down > it to the old road, but when he came to the marshy lake spoken of last > Sunday, the company refused to follow him if he made the circuit necessary > to get around it upon Crooked river again so he struck off in a westerly > direction in order to get upon the main Deschutes River. He well knew that > there was a scarcity of grass and water across here and so informed them, > but it was nearer and they would have him go it, and now blame him for > coming the route they obliged him to.James Field Jr. Journal. 1845, > \\"Crossing the Plains,\\" Willamette Farmer, Portland, Oregon, beginning with > issue dated April 18, 1879, and ending with the issue dated August 1, 1879. The train continued to Wagontire Mountain, a name it later received when early settlers found a wagon tire there. Here the emigrants camped in and around what they called the \\"Lost Hollow\\". There was water and grass but not an ample supply for the emigrants and all their livestock. As emigrants further back in the train continued to arrive, circumstances in the camp became desperate. Water quickly became scarce and many ran out of their staple supplies. In a weakened condition, more travelers became sick. Camp fever and other ailments began to overcome large numbers, especially the children and elders.Clark and Tiller. Terrible Trail, p. 48. On September 13, Field again wrote: > Started this morning in expectation of a long drive across the plain before > us, but when about four miles from camp met Meek's wife in company with a > friend, returning with the news that they had found no water as yet and > requesting all who were at the spring to remain there until he found a camp > and returned or sent word back for them to come on.

However, there was always enough grass and water to get by. But now as the train became stalled at the Lost Hollow tensions reached a boiling point. Scouts were sent out in all directions looking for water and they searched for long distances but all came back empty-handed. In 1849, Betsy Bayley recalled this event in a letter written to her sister in Ohio: > We camped at a spring which we gave the name of \\"The Lost Hollow\\" because > there was very little water there. We had men out in every direction in > search of water. They traveled 40 or 50 miles in search of water but found > none. You cannot imagine how we all felt.

After we got in the > right direction, people began to get sick.Betsy Bayley, Letter to Mrs. Lucy > P. Griffith, 1849 (Portland, OR: MSS 1508, Oregon Historical Society). The search for water ended when Meek climbed Midnight Point and from there he could see Buck Creek 25 miles due north.Brooks Geer Ragen, The Meek Cutoff: Tracing the Oregon Trail's Lost Wagon Train of 1845 (Seattle, WA: University of Washington Press, 2013), p. 111. The emigrants immediately left for Buck Creek but from this point on they were no longer following Meek.Clark and Tiller. Terrible Trail, pp. 54‚Äì55. During this period of the journey ‚Äì while emigrants were driving their livestock throughout the night to water ‚Äì the John Herren family reportedly found some gold nuggets, which led to the legend of the Lost Blue Bucket Mine. The name came from the story later circulated by some of the emigrants. The Herrens reported that if they had remained at their campsite they could have filled a blue bucket with gold nuggets. This place has never been found, but if it exists it is thought by some to be between Wagontire Mountain and the south fork of the Crooked River.Clark and Tiller. Terrible Trail, pp. 91‚Äì101. =The train splits= When the train reached the springs at the south fork one group turned west while the other continued north. The larger group followed Samuel Parker up to Steen's Ridge where wagon ruts can still be seen today. Their goal was to follow the Crooked River. The smaller group with Solomon Tetherow continued west along the north side of Hampton Butte and then followed Bear Creek. Meek traveled with this smaller company. With the help of a Native American who guided the group to water in exchange for a blanket, they reached the Deschutes River where Cline Falls is today, and then followed the Deschutes north. This group suffered more for lack of supplies, so they sent a relief party ahead to The Dalles. The relief party thought it would be a two-day journey, but it took them ten days. When they arrived at The Dalles they were in a starving condition and so weak that some of the men needed help dismounting their horses.Clark and Tiller. Terrible Trail, p. 62-89. =The train reunites= On September 26, 1845, both groups arrived on the same day at Sagebrush Springs near present-day Gateway, Oregon. They had all traveled a long distance without water, and the whole train stopped to rest on the 27th. On that day Samuel Parker entered in his diary: > May codent get to water and water was taken to them, 32 in number. Heare we > beried 6 persons. Parker later added these remarks: > Tuck what is called Meeks cutoff - a bad cutoff for all that tuck it.Samuel > Parker, Diary, 1845 (Portland, OR: MSS 1508, Oregon Historical Society). Meek continued on ahead of the company, and when he reached Sherars Falls on the Deschutes River he was warned that a father who lost two sons along the trail intended to kill him, so with the help of Native Americans a rope was sent across the swift river, and both Meek and his wife were guided through the water with ropes tied around them. They hurried to the Mission at The Dalles where they convinced Black Harris, a mountain man, to return to the falls with a crew and equipment to help the emigrants cross. In this way Meek made his escape, and the crew sent to help the pioneers arrived in time to help the over 1,000 people cross with their wagons. The wagons were taken completely apart to facilitate the dangerous crossing. Some of the emigrants crossed from the low banks, using their wagon box as a boat and guided by ropes over the swift current. Others used a rope and pulley system above the high walls of the narrows about two miles downstream. It took nearly two weeks to cross everyone in the wagon train. The starving and exhausted emigrants finally reached The Dalles beginning around the 2nd week of October, having suffered 23 known deaths and probably many more. It is estimated that another 25 of the exhausted emigrants died after reaching The Dalles.Clark and Tiller. Terrible Trail, p. 115-119. The deaths and other circumstances created resentment towards Meek and led to the often used phrase \\"Meek deserted them in the desert.\\",Clark and Tiller. Terrible Trail, p. 138. despite his having stayed with his emigrants throughout most of the journey.Clark and Tiller. Terrible Trail, p. 138-143.

Early life Shrum was born in Smithville, Ontario, the son of Emma Jane (n√©e Merritt) and William Burton Shrum. His education at Victoria College at the University of Toronto, where he started in 1913, was interrupted by World War I. A friend of Lester (Mike) Pearson, he was in his Canadian Officers Training Corps (C.O.T.C.) unit starting in 1914. Their company commander was Vincent Massey. Career =Military= On April 1, 1916, he enlisted in the army. He was a gunner and fought at the Battle of Vimy Ridge. He received the Military Medal during the war. =Academia= After the war, he continued his education and received a Bachelor of Arts in 1919, a Master of Arts in 1921. As a doctoral student in February 1923 he was the first to replicate Kamerlingh Onnes's 1908 Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning feat of liquefying helium. Later that year he was awarded his Doctorate in physics for studies of the hydrogen spectrum. As a post-doctoral fellow he was the first to identify the prominent green line in the Aurora Borealis as due to oxygen. SFU Architects and President Shrum In 1925, he joined the faculty at the University of British Columbia (UBC) where he taught physics. In 1935 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. From 1938 to 1961, he was the head of the Physics Department. Circa 1945-1950, he was also Director of Emergency Housing, allocating former WWII Army huts for faculty and staff housing on campus in Acadia Camp and Fort Camp.newspaper item in Ubyssey student newspaper November 22, 1945, page 1, column 1 \\"Total of 87 Huts Here by New Year\\", http://www.library.ubc.ca/archives/pdfs/ubyssey/UBYSSEY_1945_11_22.pdf From 1957 to 1961, he was the Dean of Graduate Studies and served on the Senate of the University. However, he was forced to retire at the age of 65 due to their rules. In 1958, he was chairman of a royal commission investigating the BC Power Commission. He was also named a member of the Order of the British Empire. After retiring from UBC, he was appointed head of BC Electric by Premier W.A.C. Bennett and was involved with the Peace River hydro project. This project comprised the construction of the W.A.C. Bennett Dam, which impounds Williston Lake Reservoir, and the construction of a 2730 MW powerhouse (at that time the largest in the world) named after him: the G.M. Shrum Generating Station. In 1969, he was the recipient of Electrical Man of the Year. He stayed at BC Hydro until 1972. During this time, Shrum was also involved in establishing Simon Fraser University and served as its first chancellor from 1963 to 1968. During this time, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada. A few years later, in 1975, he was appointed Director of the Vancouver Museum and Planetarium Association. In 1986, he wrote his autobiography with Peter Stursberg, called Gordon Shrum: An Autobiography. Shrum died in Vancouver, British Columbia, just six months before his 90th birthday.

The signatories hoped to create a market in Latin America and offered tariff rebates among member nations. In 1980, LAFTA reorganized into the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) which now has 13 members: Argentine Republic, Republic of Bolivia, Federative Republic of Brazil, Republic of Chile, Republic of Colombia, Republic of Cuba, Republic of Ecuador, United Mexican States, Republic of Panama, Republic of Paraguay, Republic of Peru, Eastern Republic of Uruguay and Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Latin American Free Trade Association came into effect on January 2, 1962. When the trade association commenced it had seven members and its main goal was to eliminate all duties and restrictions on the majority of their trade within a twelve-year period.Schmitter, Phillip C. ‚ÄúMexico and Latin American Economic Integration‚Äù. California: Institute of International Studies, 1964. 1. By the late 1960s the area of LAFTA had a population of 220 million and produced about $90 billion of goods and services annually. By the same time it had an average per capita gross national product of $440.Yudelman, Montague. ‚ÄúAgricultural Development and Economic Integration in Latin America‚Äù. London: Inter-American Development Bank, 1969. 23. By 1970, LAFTA expanded to include four more Latin American nations which were Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. It now consisted of eleven nations. In 1980, LAFTA reorganized into the Latin American Integration Association (Asociaci√≥n Latinoamericana de Integraci√≥n, ALADI) The membership of ALADI had remained unchanged until Cuba joined in 1999. The goal of the LAFTA is the creation of a free trade zone in Latin America. It should foster mutual regional trade among the member states, as well as with the U.S. and the European Union. To achieve these goals, several institutions are foreseen: *the council of foreign ministers *a conference of all participating countries *a permanent council The LAFTA agreement has important limitations: it only refers to goods, not to services, and it does not include a coordination of policies. Compared e.g. to the European Union the political and economic integration is very limited. LAFTA brought many new positive changes to Latin America. With LAFTA in place existing productive capacity could be used more fully to supply regional needs, industries could reduce costs as a result of potential economies through expanded output and regional specialization, and attraction to new investment occurred as a result of the regional market area.Mathis, Ferdinand John. \\"Economic Integration in Latin America\\". Austin: Bureau of Business Research, 1969. 3. Although LAFTA has brought many constructive results, it has also brought problems to individual nations as well as to Latin America as a whole. Some of the problems which the individual countries face are the way they are grouped together by their economic strengths according to LAFTA. The grouping was originally Brazil and Argentina in one group, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela in the second group, and the last group which included Bolivia, Ecuador, and Paraguay.Mathis, Ferdinand John. \\"Economic Integration in Latin America\\". Austin: Bureau of Business Research, 1969. 12. There is a problem in these classifications because these countries are very different economically as well as in other aspects which the classification does not take into account. Problems which Latin America faced as a whole had to deal with many of the nations in the continent being underdeveloped. The Free Trade Agreement was seen as a way of the countries having greater economic interactions amongst each other and thus improving the economic state of the poorer nations. ALADI is now the largest Latin-American group of integration. It covers more than 20 million sq kilometres and more than 493 million people.aladi.org It is responsible for regulations on foreign trade which includes regulations on technical measures, sanitary regulations, environment protection measures, quality control measures, automatic licensing measures, price control measures, monopolistic measures, as well as other measures. These regulations are put into place in order for trade to be even handed amongst members of ALADI. References 'Bibliography Rivera, Salvador.

Eight colours are recognised for both standard-sized and bantam fowl. A breed association, the Sussex Breed Club, was organised in 1903.  History  A light Sussex cock Speckled Sussex hen The Sussex originates in the historic county of Sussex, in south-east England. It is among the oldest of British chicken breeds: birds described as \\"Old Sussex or Kent Fowl\\" were shown at the first poultry show at London Zoo in 1845. The Sussex was not included in the first poultry standard, the Standard of Excellence in Exhibition Poultry of William Bernhardt Tegetmeier, in 1865. The breed standard for the Sussex was drawn up in 1902, with three colour varieties, the light, the red and the speckled. Of these, the speckled was the oldest. The development of the light variety was probably influenced by Oriental breeds such as the Brahma and Cochin, and also by the silver-grey Dorking. The red was originally black-breasted; it and the brown may have been influenced by Indian Game. The buff variety appeared in the 1920s, and was followed by the white, a sport from the light. The most recent variety is the silver. In the early part of the twentieth century, until the advent of commercial hybrid strains at about the time of the Second World War, the Sussex and the Rhode Island Red were the two principal meat breeds in the United Kingdom. Utility strains of the Sussex developed, with better productive capabilities but smaller and less well marked than was expected for exhibition purposes.  Characteristics  The Sussex chicken is graceful with a long, broad, flat back; a long and straight breastbone; wide shoulders; and a rectangular build. The tail is held at a 45 degree angle from the body. The eyes are red in the darker varieties but orange in the lighter ones. The comb is single. The earlobes are red and the legs and skin white in every variety. Cocks weigh approximately and hens about Eight colour varieties are recognised by the Poultry Club of Great Britain: brown, buff, coronation, light, red, silver, speckled and white. The light Sussex has a white body with a black tail and black in the flight feathers and wing coverts; the neck hackles are white with black striping. The buff has the same markings, but with greenish- black on a golden-buff ground. The silver is similar to the light, but has grey thighs and a dark breast with silver lacing. The red has the same markings as the light, but the base colour is a rich dark red throughout. The speckled is a rich dark mahogany colour, each feather with a white tip. The white is pure white throughout. The coronation Sussex has the same markings as the light, but with lavender instead of the black. It was created for the coronation of Edward VIII ‚Äì an event which never took place ‚Äì and had disappeared by about the time of the Second World War. It was thought to have the same red, white and blue colours as the Union Flag. A coronation bantam was re-created in the 1980s. The American Poultry Association recognises three colours: light, red and speckled. The red and speckled were added to the Standard of Perfection in 1914, and the light in 1929.  Use  The Sussex was traditionally reared as a table bird, for meat production. In the early part of the twentieth century it was one of the principal breeds kept for this purpose, until it was displaced by modern industrial hybrid lines. It may be kept as a dual-purpose bird. Hens lay some 180‚Äì200 tinted eggs per year; some layer strains may give up to 250. The eggs weigh about . The Sussex is also reared for showing.

Data element definitions are critical for external users of any data system. Good definitions can dramatically ease the process of mapping one set of data into another set of data. This is a core feature of distributed computing and intelligent agent development. There are several guidelines that should be followed when creating high-quality data element definitions.  Properties of clear definitions  A good definition is: # Precise - The definition should use words that have a precise meaning. Try to avoid words that have multiple meanings or multiple word senses. The definition should use the shortest description. The definition should not use the term you are trying to define in the definition itself. This is known as a circular definition. # Distinct - The definition should differentiate a data element from other data elements. This process is called disambiguation - The definition should be free of embedded rationale, functional usage, legal metadata registration. Definitions should not refer to terms or concepts that might be misinterpreted by others or that have different meanings based on the context of a situation. Definitions should not contain acronyms that are not clearly defined or linked to other precise definitions. If one is creating a large number of data elements, all the definitions should be consistent with related concepts. Critical Data Element ‚Äì Not all data elements are of equal importance or value to an organization. A key metadata property of an element is categorizing the data as a Critical Data Element (CDE). This categorization provides focus for data governance and data quality. An organization often has various sub-categories of CDEs, based on use of the data. e.g.: # Security Coverage ‚Äì data elements that are categorized as personal health record.personal health information or PHI warrant particular attention for security and access # Marketing Department Usage ‚Äì The marketing department could have a particular set of CDEs identified for identifying Unique Customer or for Campaign Management. # Finance Department Usage ‚Äì The Finance department could have a different set of CDEs from Marketing. They are focused on data elements which provide measures and metrics for fiscal reporting. Standards such as the ISO/IEC 11179 Metadata Registry specification give guidelines for creating precise data element definitions. Specifically chapter four of the ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry standard. Using precise words Common words such as play or run database documents over 57 different distinct meanings for the word \\"play\\" but only a single definition for the term dramatic play. Fewer definitions in a chosen word's dictionary entry is preferable. This minimizes misinterpretation related to a reader's context and background. The process of finding a good meaning of a word is called Word sense disambiguation  Examples of definitions that could be improved  Here is the definition of \\"person\\" data element as defined in the www.w3c.org Friend of a Friend specification *: Person: A person. Although most people do have an intuitive understanding of what a person is, the definition has much room for improvement. The first problem is that the definition is circular. Note that this definition really does not help most readers and needs to be clarified. Here is the definition of the \\"Person\\" Data Element in the Global Justice XML Data Model 3.0 *: person: Describes inherent and frequently associated characteristics of a person. Note that once again the definition is still circular. Person should not reference itself. The definition should use terms other than person to describe what a person is. Here is a more precise but shorter definition of a person: Person: An individual human being. Note that it uses the word individual to state that this is an instance of a class of things called human being. Technically you might use \\"homo sapiens\\" in your definition, but more people are familiar with the term \\"human being\\" than \\"homo sapiens,\\" so commonly used terms, if they are still precise, are always preferred. Sometimes your system may have cultural norms and assumptions in the definitions. For example, if your \\"Person\\" data element tracked characters in a science fiction series that included aliens you may need a more general term other than human being. Person: An individual of a sentient species.

The Bravery played at the Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2005, following a year of success and increasing popularity. Their set was due to be broadcast live on BBC Three in the daytime, but had to be shown well after the watershed since Hindert stripped naked on stage because of the hot weather.

Etymology The village's name is taken from Isaiah 5:1:Vilnay, Zev, Rachel and Oren: The Vilnay Guide to Israel.

History The moshav was founded in 1905, and was one of the first villages established on Jewish National Fund land; the first Jewish National Fund forest is also located in Ben Shemen. According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Ben Shemen had a population of 90 Jews. Which had increased in the 1931 census to 353 residents, in 30 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 19 In 1923 it was split in two, with a group of trial farms eventually becoming a separate moshav, Kerem Ben Shemen. The Ben Shemen Youth Village was established adjacent to the moshav in 1927 and is today a large agricultural boarding school. During World War II, Ben Shemen was the site of a British search for weapons. Similar searches were a common British response to Jewish opposition to the White Paper of 1939. In 1947 Ben Shemen had a population of 75. The village experienced extensive damage during the early days of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war and had to be reconstructed. Immigrants from Romania joined the moshav in 1952. Some houses were built by Bezalel Academy of Art and Design founder Boris Schatz.

We won that match and the replay that followed. For many years we played as Harrodians RFC before moving to our Barn Elms location in 1987.\\". In 2005, this claim was amplified in a Daily Telegraph article by BBC sports presenter John Inverdale.

Illustration by Louis Rhead for an edition of Charles and Mary Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare (1918). Snug is a minor character from William Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream. He is a joiner who comes from Athens who is hired by Peter Quince to play the part of the lion in Pyramus and Thisbe. When he is first assigned the part, he is afraid it may take him a while to finally remember his lines (even though the lion's role was nothing but roaring originally). Bottom offers to play the part of the lion (as he offers to play all other parts), but he is rejected by Quince, who worries (as do the other characters) that his loud and ferocious roar in the play will frighten the ladies of power in the audience and get Quince and all his actors hanged. In the end, the lion's part is revised to explain that he is in fact not a lion and means the audience no harm. Snug is often played as a stupid man, a manner describing almost all of the Mechanicals. Snug is the only Mechanical to whom the playwright did not assign a first name. In Jean-Louis and Jules Supervielle's French adaptation, Le Songe d'une nuit d'√©t√© (1959), Snug is renamed to , where Georges Neveux's 1945 adaptation used the English names. On the Elizabethan stage, the role of Snug and the other Mechanicals was intended to be doubled with Titania's four fairy escorts: Moth, Mustardseed, Cobweb, and Peaseblossom.

History The murder of Archbishop Ambrosius. Engraving by Charles Michel Geoffroy, 1845The first signs of plague in Moscow appeared in late 1770, which would turn into a major epidemic in the spring of 1771. The measures undertaken by the authorities, such as creation of forced quarantines, destruction of contaminated property without compensation or control, closing of public baths, etc., caused fear and anger among the citizens. The city's economy was mostly paralyzed because many factories, markets, stores, and administrative buildings had been closed down. All of this was followed by acute food shortages, causing deterioration of living conditions for the majority of the Muscovites. Dvoryane (Russian nobility) and well-off city dwellers left Moscow due to the plague outbreak. The first outbursts of mass protest against the measures undertaken by the authorities took place on August 29 and September 1 in a neighborhood of Lefortovo. By early September, the rumors of an imminent uprising had already been circulating. An attempt by the Archbishop Ambrose of Moscow to prevent the citizens from gathering at the Icon of the Virgin Mary of Bogolyubovo (–ò–∫–æ–Ω–∞ –ë–æ–≥–æ–ª—é–±—Å–∫–æ–π –ë–æ–≥–æ–º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏) in Kitai-gorod as a quarantine measure served as an immediate cause for the Plague Riot. On September 15, huge crowds of Muscovites began to flow towards Red Square at the sound of the alarm bell. Pushing aside a military unit, they burst into the Kremlin and destroyed the Chudov Monastery (archbishop's residence) and its wine cellars. Archbishop Ambrosius managed to escape to the Donskoy Monastery. On September 16, the riot gained in strength. Angry citizens captured the Donskoy Monastery, killed Archbishop Ambrosius, and destroyed two quarantine zones (Danilov Monastery and the one beyond the Serpukhov Gates). In the afternoon, most of the rebels approached the Kremlin and were met by a number of military units. The crowd demanded the surrender of Lieutenant General Pyotr Yeropkin, who had been overseeing the affairs of Moscow after Pyotr Saltykov's departure. As soon as the Muscovites tried to attack the Kremlin's Spasskiye Gates, the army opened fire with buckshot, dispersing the crowd and capturing some of the rebels. On the morning of September 17, around 1000 people gathered at the Spasskiye gates again, demanding the release of captured rebels and elimination of quarantines. The army managed to disperse the crowd yet again and finally suppressed the riot. Some 300 people were brought to trial. A government commission headed by Grigory Orlov was sent to Moscow on September 26 to restore order. It took some measures against the plague and provided citizens with work and food, which would finally pacify the people of Moscow. The commission improved services in quarantines, put an end to the burning of property, reopened public baths, permitted trade, increased food deliveries, and organized public works. At the same time, the commission was engaged in prosecuting those who had taken part in the Plague Riot. Four of them were executed; 165 adults and twelve teenagers were subjected to punishment. With the onset of cold weather, the outbreak began to subside. Around 200,000 people died in Moscow and its outskirts during the plague. There was another unlikely convict‚Äîthe church bell that was used to start the alarm. By the order of Catherine II, an executor cut the tang from the bell. For more than thirty years, the silent bell hung on the bell tower. Eventually, in 1803, it was removed and sent to the Arsenal and, in 1821, to the Kremlin Armoury.

The ESMF development team was centered at NCAR until 2009, after which it moved to the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory. Editing Earth System Modeling Framework is free software released under the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License. Purpose ESMF increases the interoperability of Earth-science modeling software developed at different sites and promotes code reuse. The idea is to transform distributed, specialized knowledge and resources into a collaborative, integrated modeling community that operates more efficiently, can address a wider variety of problems more effectively, and is more responsive to societal needs. Software architecture ESMF is based on principles of component-based software engineering. The components within an ESMF software application usually represent large-scale physical domains such as the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, or land surface. Some models also represent specific processes (e.g. ocean biogeochemistry, the impact of solar radiation on the atmosphere) as components. In ESMF, components can create and drive other components so that an ocean biogeochemistry component can be part of a larger ocean component. The software that connects physical domains is called a coupler in the Earth system modeling community. Couplers follow the mediator pattern and take the outputs from one component and transform them into the inputs that are needed to run another component. Transformations may include unit conversions, grid interpolation or remapping, mergers (i.e., combining land and ocean surfaces to form a completely covered global surface) or other specialized transformations. In ESMF, couplers are also software components. Capabilities ESMF represents user data in the form of data objects such as grids, fields, and arrays. The user data within a component may be copied or referenced into these ESMF objects. Once user data is part of an ESMF data object, framework methods can be used to transform and transfer the data as required to other components in the system. This generally happens within a coupler component. Grid interpolation and remapping are core utilities of ESMF. Interpolation weights can be generated in ESMF using bilinear interpolation, finite element patch recovery, and conservative remapping methods. ESMF can associate metadata with data objects. The metadata, in the form of name and value pairs, is grouped into packages, which can be written out in XML and other standard formats. ESMF metadata packages are based on community conventions including the Climate and Forecast Metadata Conventions and the METAFOR Common Information Model. History The ESMF collaboration had its roots in the Common Modeling Infrastructure Working Group (CMIWG), an unfunded, grass-roots effort to explore ways of enhancing collaborative Earth system model development. The CMIWG attracted broad participation from major weather and climate modeling groups at research and operational centers. In a series of meetings held from 1998 to 2000, CMIWG members established general requirements and a preliminary design for a common software framework. In September 2000, the NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) released a solicitation that called for the creation of an ESMF. A critical mass of CMIWG participants agreed to develop a coordinated response, based on their strawman framework design, and submitted three linked proposals. The first focused on development of the core ESMF software, the second on deployment of Earth science modeling applications, and the third on deployment of ESMF data assimilation applications. All three proposals were funded, at a collective level of $9.8 million over a three-year period. As the ESMF project gained momentum, it replaced the CMIWG as the focal point for developing community modeling infrastructure. During the period of NASA funding, the ESMF team developed a prototype of the framework and used it in a number of experiments that demonstrated coupling of modeling components from different institutions. ESMF was also used as the basis for the construction of a new model, the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) atmospheric general circulation model at NASA Goddard. As the end of the first funding cycle for ESMF neared, its collaborators wrote a project plan that described how ESMF could transition to an organization with multi-agency sponsorship for its next funding cycle. Major new five-year grants came from NASA, through the Modeling Analysis and Prediction (MAP) program for climate change and variability, and from the Department of Defense Battlespace Environments Institute. The National Science Foundation (NSF) continued funding part of the development team through NCAR core funds. Many smaller ESMF-based application adoption projects were funded in domains as diverse as space weather and sediment transport. Also at the end of the first funding cycle, the ESMF collaborators wrote a white paper on future directions for the ESMF. This paper formed the basis for a proposal to NSF to combine ESMF (and other software frameworks) with data services to create a computational environment that supports an end-to-end modeling workflow. In 2008, a project manager was appointed for the National Unified Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC), a joint project for weather prediction of the United States Navy, the National Weather Service, and the United States Air Force.

It is characterized by the use of a pilota, a very big meatball spiced with garlic and parsley; it also contains vegetables as celery, cabbage, carrots, etc. depending on the season. Additionally, bones, sausages called botifarra, and other types of meat, can be used. In historical times a type called escudella de pag√®s, which had pasta and rice, was traditionally made on Thursdays and Sundays.  Service  Escudella is typically served in two parts: * The escudella proper is a soup consisting of a broth with pasta, rice or both. * The carn d'olla is all the meat used in the broth, served afterwards in a tray along with the vegetables used. When both parts are served mixed together, it is called escudella barrejada.  Escudella de Nadal  There is a particular version of this soup that can be called \\"escudella de Nadal\\" (Christmas soup) or either \\"sopa de galets\\" (galets' soup) and it is very typical on Christmas Day.

It was founded in late 1990 by Andreas \\"Thedi\\" Thedens in order to make music inspired by Thedis lyrics, that made him a local hero of L√ºneburg underground culture. History KiEw began with avant-garde and dada- industrial sound experiments and later changed to more rhythmic power electro- industrial/power noise upon the release of Feierabend in 2000. The band uses a lot of break beat, techno elements, and voice samples from movies and audio books, among other sources. The band has been signed to Out Of Line Music since 2000. The main themes of the music are insanity, schizophrenia, paranoia, and therapy. The first lineup of KiEw consisted of founder Andreas \\"Thedi\\" Thedens and his school friends Thilo Eichenberg, Birk L√ºbberstedt and Jan Michel Luckow. After the early recording sessions beginning of 1991, Birk L√ºbberstedt left the band. Tassilo Schmitt joined during the first sessions and also Thomas \\"Biwi\\" Bierbach became a new band member as a singer and percussionist. In December 1993 KiEw had its live debut at Dorfgemeinschafthaus Ochtmissen near L√ºneburg (Lower Saxony/Germany). Meanwhile, Tassilo Schmitt did not identify with KiEws music and aims anymore, so he left. Stephan \\"Thiemi\\" Thiemicke joined the band for playing bass, analog synth, and live performance shouting. Thilo Eichenberg (guitar) took part in the rehearsals, but left a short time before the debut show at Dorfgemeinschaftshaus Ochtmissen. Matthias Kulcke became new guitarist. Together with Stephan Thiemicke (bass), Martin M√§lzer (guitar, vocals), and Thorsten Krolow (drums) he also formed the band Mohai in the early 90s. In 2000 Thomas Bierbach and Jan Michel Luckow left, so KiEw became a trio until 2010, when Martin M√§lzer (vocals, drums) officially joined KiEw. Before becoming an official member, Martin M√§lzers voice appeared on some KiEw releases. He was special guest at some KiEw live shows as a singer, did remixes for KiEw and assisted the KiEw audio engineer Hauke Dressler several times since 2009. In 2017 Martin M√§lzer resigned from the band after the Primal Uproar Festival at Motorschiff Stubnitz in Hamburg in July.

The ingredients typically are soybeans, salt, rice wine and sesame oil or vinegar. In mainland China the product is often freshly distributed. In overseas Chinese communities living in Southeast Asia, commercially packaged versions are often sold in jars containing blocks 2- to 4-cm square by 1 to 2 cm thick soaked in brine with select flavorings. History According to the 1596 Compendium of Materia Medica written by the Chinese polymath Li Shizhen during the Ming dynasty, the creation of soybean curd is attributed to the Han Dynasty Prince Liu An (179 ‚Äì 122 BC), prince of Huainan. Manufacturing began during the Han Dynasty in China after it was created. =Names= In Mandarin, the product is generally known as d√≤uf«îr«î (), \\"d√≤ur«î\\" () or f«îr«î () though in southwest China it is often known as l«îf«î (). In English it is sometimes referred to as \\"soy cheese\\".  Nutrition  = Nutritional value = Fermented bean curd contains organic acids, alcohol, esters and other flavor primitives; it contains a large amount of hydrolyzed protein, free amino acids, fat, carbohydrates, thiamine, riboflavin, oxalic acid, calcium, phosphorus and other nutritional ingredients; it contains no cholesterol. The amount of protein inside fermented tofu is about 12%-22%. In the 1980s, fermented bean curd contains lower than 0.5g per amino acid (18 amino acid in total). In the near 2000, the amount of the amino acid increased to about 0.5g-0.8g per one amino acid. Some amino acids, such as cystine, methionine and tryptophan, may disappear in the fermented bean curd. Ho et al. (1989) compared the volatile flavor compounds of red fermented bean curd and white fermented bean curd. Red fermented bean curd contains much larger amounts of alcohols, esters, and acids than the white variety. This may be due to the fermentation of red rice by Monascus spp. The differences in nutritional properties and fermentation between the two varieties are accompanied by differences in flavor and colour. = Health care function = During the process of fermenting, more peptides and isoflavones were being secreted. The fermented bean curd is beneficial in some extra health care function, such as decreasing the chances of getting coronary heart disease, lowering blood pressure and prevention of osteoporosis. The Food Encyclopedia, written by Wang Su-Hsiung (1861) of the Qing Dynasty, made reference to preserved bean curd as superior to difficult- to-digest, hardened tofu especially for the elderly, children and ill persons. Fermented bean curd is easier to digest than unfermented bean curd. It is easier for patients, elderly or children to eat and absorb the nutrition. Characteristics Fermented bean curd has a special mouthfeel similar to certain dairy products due to the breakdown of its proteins which takes place during the air drying and fermentation. Lacking strong flavor prior to fermentation, fermented bean curd takes on the aroma and flavor of its marinade. The flavor is salty with mild sweetness. The texture and taste of fermented bean curd resembles a firm, smooth paste not unlike creamy blue cheese. (Indeed, this kind of tofu is sometimes called \\"Chinese cheese\\" in English). Refrigerated, it can be kept for several years, during which time its flavor is believed to improve. =Culinary use= Wonton noodles with pig trotters braised with nam yu (fermented bean curd) Fermented tofu is commonly used as a condiment, combined into sauces to accompany hot pot, or consumed at breakfast to flavor rice, porridge, gruel, congee, or erkuai. Usually either several bricks are placed in a small bowl covered in the flavored brine or one to one half bricks are placed into a bowl. Then, chunks are broken off the brick and consumed with a mouthful of porridge or gruel. The brine may also be used for flavoring. Fermented bean curd can also be added in small amounts, together with its brine, to flavor stir-fried or braised vegetable dishes (particularly leafy green vegetables such as water spinach). In the Chaoshan region of China, fermented tofu is the main ingredient used to make a stuffed biscuit known as ‚Äúfuru bing‚Äù. =Comparison with cheese= Both tofu and cheese are made from curds obtained from the coagulation of soy milk and dairy milk respectively. However, soybean curds are formed from the chemical destabilization of the micelles (using calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, etc.) allowing protein bonding while cheese curds are created from the enzymatic (rennet) hydrolysis of casein into para-casein. The bean curds are then simply pressed to produce tofu and thus bland and highly perishable, like unaged cheese, while fermented bean curd, like aged cheese, is ripened with microorganisms and thus flavorful and long-lasting. Varieties Stinky tofu. White preserved bean curd is the most common type and can be described without the white adjective. The flavor, color and aroma can be altered using various combinations of spices and seasoning in the brine with alterations in the commonly used combination of 10% rice wine and 12% salt. Those with no alcohol produces \\"small cheese cubes\\" (hih-fang) while those with double the alcohol content produces \\"drunken cheese\\" (tsui-fang). This variety is also available with chili and/or sesame oil. Seasonings can include anise, cinnamon, lemon juice, lemon zest, dried shrimp, and ham. In addition, one can also obtain the curd dried, and without brine, which are then sold in paper cartons. Red fermented bean curd (, or ) incorporates red yeast rice (cultivated with Monascus purpureus) with the brining liquor for a deep-red color and distinctively thickened flavor and aroma. This variety may also contain chili. A popular derivative of this variety has an appearance of ketchup and is seasoned with rose wine, caramel and natural sugar. Stinky fermented bean curd is fermented for over six months and is also popular due to its strong creamy flavor. However due to its strong acrid smell, this variety is an acquired taste. Note that stinky sufu differs from stinky tofu in appearance, consistency and salt content. Stinky sufu are made in the same cube-like shapes and has a similar smooth soft creamy texture as regular white sufu. In Taiwan, a green version is popular and made with sake lees, crushed leaves and a green mucor mold. It is then fermented for 12 hours and sold on the streets. Chiang fermented bean curd (Chiang-doufu) is made with cubes of tofu soaked in either Chinese-style miso (Chiang) or soy sauce for several days. Usually reddish-brown in color and salty, it may be dried and fermented further and may also be mixed with sake lees. In Japan, miso is used. Production Typical glass bottle of fermented chili bean curd In order to produce fermented bean curd, cubes of dried tofu are allowed to fully air-dry under hay and slowly ferment from aerial bacteria and fungal spores. Commercially available fermented bean curd is made by using dry firm tofu that has been inoculated with the fungal spores of Actinomucor elegans, Mucor sufu, Mucor rouxanus, Mucor wutuongkiao, Mucor racemosus, or Rhizopus spp.. This freshly fermented tofu is known as 'mold tofu' (). The dry fermented tofu is then soaked in brine, typically enhanced with Chinese rice wine, vinegar, chili peppers or sesame oil, or a paste made of rice and soybeans. In the case of red fermented bean curd, red yeast rice (cultivated with Monascus purpureus) is added for color.The Hwang Ryh Shang Company of Taiwan, a major producer of fermented bean curd, mislabels this ingredient as \\"red date\\" (jujube) on the English-language list of ingredients on its product labels , although the Chinese list of ingredients on the same product lists Á¥ÖÁ≥ü (literally \\"red lees\\", i.e. red yeast rice). Fermented bean curd is generally sold in small glass jars.

Osceola, representing the historical Seminole leader Osceola, and his Appaloosa horse Renegade introduce home football games by riding to midfield with a burning spear and planting it in the turf. Osceola and Renegade debuted in 1978, and are the most recent of several mascots used by the school. FSU has tried to ensure a dignified depiction of Osceola. The portrayal is supported by leaders of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, but it remains controversial in some quarters. Depiction Florida State's Osceola tradition is overseen by Allen Durham, whose father, Bill Durham, introduced it in 1978. Osceola wears a Native American-themed costume that is designed and approved by the Seminole Tribe of Florida, consisting of leather clothing, moccasins, face paint, and a garnet bandana.. He carries a feathered spear and is accompanied by Renegade, an appaloosa horse whom he rides bareback. Osceola performs at all home football games at Doak Campbell Stadium and related events like Homecoming. He initiates each game by charging Renegade to midfield and hurling a flaming spear into the ground.. The Durham family personally selects and trains both the rider and horse, and it coordinates the tradition with oversight by the university. Students portraying Osceola must undertake a two-year apprenticeship, demonstrate necessary riding skill for the role as well as moral character and maintain a grade-point average of 3.0. Students receive a scholarship for portraying Osceola and are required to remain in character and abide by a set of protocols throughout all performances. There is only one Osceola impersonator at a time; as of 2014 sixteen students have played the role, with the sixteenth rider currently serving.Rosier, p. 14. History Chick Cicio as Sammy Seminole at Homecoming, 1958 =Previous mascots= Florida State University adopted the Seminoles nickname in 1947, just after its reorganization from a women's college to a coed institution. The moniker was selected through a fan competition; reportedly the newly established football team liked it so much that they stuffed the ballot box to ensure its selection. Prior to the introduction of Osceola and Renegade, the Florida State Seminoles used several different Native American-themed mascots. The first was Sammy Seminole, introduced at the FSU Pow Wow in 1958 for football games. This mascot was portrayed by a white male member of the gymnastics or circus programs, who performed wild stunts in garish faux-Native American garb. The gymnastics program's sponsorship of Sammy Seminole ended in 1968, but the character was quickly reintroduced. In the late 1960s Chief Fullabull emerged as a mascot during basketball games. Like Sammy Seminole, he donned cartoonish Native American-themed outfits, and performed clownish stunts. Under protest from Native American groups, the character's name was altered to Chief Wampumstompum, though this did nothing to assuage the concerns of protesters. The character was replaced with a more traditionally dressed figure named Yahola, also known as the \\"spirit chief\\". All of these mascots were eventually retired, and officials decided to find a more respectful representative for the school's teams. Osceola and Renegade at the 2011 game against the University of Miami in Tallahassee, FL =Development of Osceola= The Osceola and Renegade mascots were conceived by Bill Durham, a Tallahassee businessman and Florida State alumnus. He came up with the concept of a horseback-riding Seminole mascot as early as 1962, when he was voted into the school's homecoming court. He returned to the idea in 1977, and won the support of Ann Bowden, wife of head football coach Bobby Bowden, who helped make the idea a reality. Durham contacted the Seminole Tribe of Florida about the project, and chairman Howard Tommie had tribe members make the first costume for Osceola. Durham provided the horse, while Bowden helped acquire the various permits necessary to allow a horse onto the field. Osceola and Renegade debuted at a September 16, 1978 game against the Oklahoma State Cowboys. They proved quite popular, and subsequently other faux-Indian traditions arose, including the \\"War Chant\\" in 1984 and the \\"Tomahawk Chop\\" shortly after. Durham oversaw the Osceola tradition for 25 years, and over time aspects of the performance have become more refined and regulated. In 2002, Durham retired and passed his role on to his son Allen Durham, a former Osceola portrayer. Osceola and Renegade in 2008 In the 1980s and 1990s, when mascots based on Native Americans became more controversial and many Native Americans and supporters protested their use, Florida State consulted with the Seminole Tribe of Florida, emphasizing that Osceola was never intended to be demeaning. Several representatives of the Seminole Tribe, including Chairman James E. Billie and Council Member Max Osceola, have given FSU their blessing to use Osceola and Seminole imagery. However, the matter remains controversial for other Florida Seminoles, as well as members of the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma. Critics have noted a political undercurrent in the support from Florida Seminole leaders, who are heavily involved in business ventures such as Indian casinos in the state. In 2005, the NCAA added FSU to a list of schools facing potential sanctions for using \\"hostile and abusive\\" Indian mascots and names; after much deliberation, the NCAA gave FSU an exemption, citing the university's relationship with the Seminole Tribe of Florida as a major factor. In keeping with his stoic portrayal, FSU refers to Osceola and Renegade as a \\"symbols\\" rather than mascots, and does not use them for more traditional mascot activities like cheerleading and promotions. In 2012, the university revived an older mascot, an anthropomorphic horse named \\"Cimarron\\", to fill this role. In April 2016, the FSU Student Government Association voted to discourage the wearing of Native American headdresses from sporting events as being contrary to the goal of maintaining its relationship with the Seminole Tribe, because the headdresses worn by fans are closer to those worn by Plains Indians. Although referred to as a ban, the vote did not change official university policy regarding student conduct, and imposes no penalty. Osceola through the years The first student to portray Osceola was Jim Kidder in 1978. Since then, six different Renegades and 17 different riders have portrayed the role.

He was imprisoned from 1956 to 1960, 1962 to 1967, and again from 1983 to 1988 for anti-Soviet activity.  An anti-Soviet dissident Tarto was involved in nationalist activities since his youth. On November 4, 1956 Enn Tarto and other members of the Estonian Youth Brigade (Eesti Noorte Malev) distributed leaflets in support of Hungarian Revolution, 1956. The message reached the West and via Western broadcasts, the students of Moscow State University. Some of these students plus lecturers were expelled for approving the Hungarians. Later, Tarto met some of these in a prison in Mordovia. For his action, Enn Tarto has been awarded of the Officer Cross of the Merit Order of the Hungarian Republic. After being imprisoned twice, Enn Tarto studied from 1969 to 1971 in Tartu University Estonian philology. As Tarto was accepted to the university, a KGB man dealing with Tarto told him: 'We've already used stick, let's try now carrot as well'. Tarto was exmatriculated in 1971 in connection with his patriotic thinking and actions. During the late 1970s, when Yuriy Andropov's anti-dissident campaign was at its peak, the dissidents of the three occupied Baltic republics decided to send a joint memorandum to the UN and the major powers. The petition, known as the Baltic Appeal, was directed to the governments of the two German states, the USSR, signatories of the Atlantic Charter and the Secretary General of the UN (Kurt Waldheim). The petition called for the elimination of the consequences of the pact and for self-determination and independence for the Baltic nations. The petition was signed by 37 Lithuanians, 4 Estonians and 4 Latvians. It was handed over to Western representatives in Moscow, August 1979. On August 23, 1979 Baltic Appeal was approved by well-known Moscow dissidents academic Andrei Sakharov, Viktor Nekipelov, Tatyana Velikanova, Malva Landa and Arina Ginzburg. Provided with these names, the document reached West, thus signed by fifty people. A reaction by the international community was the Resolution of the European Parliament, January 13, 1983. Enn Tarto was also one of these who publicly demanded for the USSR to move its troops away from Afghanistan. Enn Tarto was also active in teaching other dissidents on surviving in the conditions of a totalitarian regime. In the course of anti-dissident slander in 1980s, the authorities called Enn Tarto a teacher and leader of the \\"Anti- Soviet elements\\". In 1984, the Supreme Court of the Estonian SSR sentenced Tarto 10 years plus 5 years deprivation of civic rights, stating that he was an especially dangerous \\"anti-social recidivist\\". Enn Tarto was finally released on October 17, 1988, after public protests in Estonia and a demand by 45 US congressmen. (October 4, 1988). After release Having been released from captivity, he took actively part in Estonia‚Äôs process of regaining independence. He participated radical pro-independence movement (while not being a member of ERSP) and was elected deputy of Congress of Estonia (Eesti Kongress). Tarto was one of the organisers of the protest march around the Soviet military base near Tartu on March 8, 1989. Tartu had co-ordinated it with Dzhokhar Dudayev, who was serving there as the chief of garrison. Enn Tarto together with Linnart M√§ll took part in founding the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation, has been chairman of the Estonian Society of Pan-Europe, and chairman of council of the Estonian Human Rights Institute from 1992 to 1995. He has participated in the re-founded Estonian Defence League activities and in organisations promoting the commemoration of the victims of totalitarian regimes. Tarto has been elected three times to Riigikogu (1992, 1995, 1999), from town of Tartu or Tartu and J√µgeva region. Tarto was member of the Riigikogu from 1992 to 1995 (Fatherland Union), from 1995 to 1999 (Right-wingers) and 1999 to 2003 (People's Party Moderates). In 2005, Enn Tarto decided to leave SDE, which had chosen the line of collaborating with the People's Union (a joint list for Tallinn city council election), which mostly unites former communist party officials. He was a candidate to Tartu town council in Fatherland Union list (2005 election). Tarto has been elected three times to Tartu town council (1999, 2002, 2005). Enn Tarto has also publicly condemned the top collaborators with the Communist regime and the executors of the Communist repressions in Estonia. Enn Tarto has been awarded numerous medals by the institutions of the Republic of Estonia, including Order of the National Coat of Arms (2nd class) and the highest award by the Estonian Defence League (Eesti Kaitseliit), White Cross medal (1st rate). Valdas Adamkus has awarded him the Officer Cross of the Vytis Cross Order References * https://web.archive.org/web/20070610144707/http://si.kongress.ee/?a=page&page;=42eff598e1514827c8104&subpage;=43c2d089424b6326829ad * http://www.lituanus.org/1984_2/84_2_01.htm Documentary * Andres S√∂√∂t, Alone and Together (√úksinda ja koos), 2002 Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Estonian dissidents Category:Soviet dissidents Category:Estonian anti-communists Category:Estonian prisoners and detainees Category:Prisoners and detainees of the Soviet Union Category:Recipients of the Order of the National Coat of Arms, 2nd Class Category:Officer's Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary (civil) Category:Recipients of the Order of the Cross of Vytis Category:Members of the Riigikogu Category:Pro Patria Union politicians Category:University of Tartu alumni Category:Politicians from Tartu Category:20th-century Estonian politicians Category:21st-century Estonian politicians Category:Recipients of the Order of the White Star, 2nd Class ","title":"Enn Tarto"},{"id":"2599213","text":"Yellow rain was the subject of a 1981 political incident in which the United States Secretary of State Alexander Haig accused the Soviet Union of supplying T-2 mycotoxin to the Communist states in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia for use in counterinsurgency warfare. Refugees described many different forms of attacks, including a sticky yellow liquid falling from planes or helicopters, which was dubbed \\"yellow rain\\". The U.S. government alleged that over ten thousand people had been killed in attacks using these chemical weapons. The Soviets denied these claims and an initial United Nations investigation was inconclusive. Some samples of the supposed chemical agent that were supplied to a group of independent scientists turned out to be honeybee feces, suggesting that the \\"yellow rain\\" was due to mass defecation of digested pollen grains from large swarms of bees. Other scientists questioned the accuracy of the refugee accounts and the reliability of the chemical analyses presented by the U.S. government. The majority of the scientific literature on this topic now regards the hypothesis that yellow rain was a Soviet chemical weapon as disproved. However, the issue remains disputed and the U.S. government has not retracted these allegations, arguing that the issue has not been fully resolved. Many of the U.S. documents relating to this incident remain classified.  Allegations  T-2 mycotoxin The charges stemmed from events in Laos and North Vietnam beginning in 1975, when the two governments, which were allied with and supported by the Soviet Union, fought against Hmong tribes, peoples who had sided with the United States and South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Refugees described events that they believed to be chemical warfare attacks by low-flying aircraft or helicopters; several of the reports were of a yellow, oily liquid that was dubbed \\"yellow rain\\". Those exposed claimed neurological and physical symptoms including seizures, blindness, and bleeding. Similar reports came from the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978. A 1997 textbook produced by the U.S. Army Medical Department asserted that over ten thousand people were killed in attacks using chemical weapons in Laos, Cambodia and Afghanistan. The descriptions of the attacks were diverse and included air-dropped canisters and sprays, booby traps, artillery shells, rockets and grenades that produced droplets of liquid, dust, powders, smoke or \\"insect-like\\" materials of a yellow, red, green, white or brown color. Secretary of State Alexander Haig announced in September 1981 that: :For some time now, the international community has been alarmed by continuing reports that the Soviet Union and its allies have been using lethal chemical weapons in Laos, Kampuchea, and Afghanistan. ... We have now found physical evidence from Southeast Asia which has been analyzed and found to contain abnormally high levels of three potent mycotoxins‚Äîpoisonous substances not indigenous to the region and which are highly toxic to man and animals. The Soviet Union described these accusations as a \\"big lie\\" and in turn accused the US government of using chemical weapons during the Vietnam War. The American accusations prompted a United Nations investigation in Pakistan and Thailand. This involved five doctors and scientists who interviewed alleged witnesses and collected samples that were purported to come from Afghanistan and Cambodia. However, the interviews produced conflicting testimony and the analyses of the samples were inconclusive. The UN experts also examined two refugees who claimed to be suffering from the after-effects of a chemical attack, but the refugees were instead diagnosed as having fungal skin infections. The team reported that they were unable to verify that chemical weapons had been used but noted that circumstantial evidence \\"suggestive of the possible use of some sort of toxic chemical substance in some instances.\\"Report of the Secretary-General on Chemical and Bacteriological (Biological). Weapons, U.N. Doc. A/37/259, at 26-41 (Dec. 1, 1982) The US mycotoxin analyses were reported in the scientific literature in 1983 and 1984 and reported small amounts of mycotoxins called trichothecenes, ranging from the parts per million to traces in the parts per billion range. The lowest possible limit of detection in these mycotoxin analyses is in the parts per billion range. However, several inconsistencies in these reports caused a \\"prolonged, and at times acrimonious, debate on the validity of the analyses\\". A 2003 medical review notes that this debate may have been exacerbated since \\"Although analytical methods were in their infancy during the controversy, they were still sensitive enough to pick up low levels of environmental trichothecene contamination.\\"  Initial investigation  C. J. Mirocha at the University of Minnesota conducted a biochemical investigation, looking for the presence of trichothecene mycotoxins, including T-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), and deoxynivalenol (DON). This included chemical analyses of blood, urine, and tissue of alleged victims of chemical attacks in February 1982 in Laos and Kampuchea. \\"The finding of T-2, HT-2, and DAS toxins in blood, urine, and body tissues of alleged victims of chemical warfare in Southeast Asia provides compelling proof of the use of trichothecenes as nonconventional warfare agents. ... Additional significant findings lie in the trichothecenes found in the leaf samples (T-2, DON, nivalenol) and yellow powder (T-2, DAS). ... The most compelling evidence is the presence of T-2 and DAS in the yellow powder. Both toxins are infrequently found in nature and rarely occur together. In our experience, copious producers of T-2 toxin (F. tricinctum) do not produce DAS, and conversely, good producers of DAS (F. roseum 'Gibbosum') do not produce T-2.\\"  Explanation  = Honeybee hypothesis = In 1983, these charges were disputed by Harvard biologist and biological weapons opponent Matthew Meselson and his team, who traveled to Laos and conducted a separate investigation. Meselson's team noted that trichothecene mycotoxins occur naturally in the region and questioned the witness testimony. He suggested an alternate hypothesis that the yellow rain was the harmless fecal matter of honeybees. The Meselson team offered the following as evidence: separate \\"yellow rain drops\\" which occurred on the same leaf, and which were \\"accepted as authentic\\", consisted largely of pollen; each drop contained a different mix of pollen grains, as one would expect if they came from different bees, and the grains showed properties characteristic of pollen digested by bees (the protein inside the pollen grain was gone, while the outer indigestible shell remained). Further, the pollen mix came from plant species typical of the area where a drop was collected. Bee droppings resembling \\"yellow rain\\" The US government responded to these findings by arguing that the pollen was added deliberately, in order to make a substance that could be easily inhaled and \\"ensure the retention of toxins in the human body\\". Meselson responded to this idea by stating that it was rather far- fetched to imagine that somebody would produce a chemical weapon by \\"gathering pollen predigested by honeybees.\\" The fact that the pollen originated in Southeast Asia meant that the Soviet Union could not have manufactured the substance domestically, and would have had to import tons of pollen from Vietnam. Meselson's work was described in an independent medical review as providing \\"compelling evidence that yellow rain might have a benign natural explanation\\". After the honeybee hypothesis was made public, a literature search turned up an earlier Chinese paper on the phenomenon of yellow droppings in Jiangsu Province in September 1976. Strikingly, the Chinese villagers had also used the term \\"yellow rain\\" to describe this phenomenon. Many villagers believed that the yellow droppings were portents of imminent earthquake activity. Others believed that the droppings were chemical weapons sprayed by the Soviet Union or Taiwan. However, the Chinese scientists also concluded that the droppings came from bees. = Mycotoxins = Analyses of putative \\"yellow rain\\" samples by the British, French and Swedish governments confirmed the presence of pollen and failed to find any trace of mycotoxins. Toxicology studies questioned the reliability of reports stating that mycotoxins had been detected in alleged victims up to two months after exposure, since these compounds are unstable in the body and are cleared from the blood in just a few hours. An autopsy on a Khmer Rouge fighter named Chan Mann, a victim of a putative yellow rain attack in 1982, turned up traces of mycotoxins, but also aflatoxin, Blackwater fever, and malaria. Surveys also showed that both mycotoxin-producing fungi and mycotoxin contamination were common in Southeast Asia, casting doubt on the assertion that detecting these compounds was an unusual occurrence. For example, a Canadian military laboratory found mycotoxins in the blood of five people from the area who had never been exposed to yellow rain, out of 270 tested, but none in the blood of ten alleged victims, and a 1988 paper reported that illnesses from mycotoxin exposure may pose a serious threat to public health in Malaysia. It is now recognized that mycotoxin contamination of foods such as wheat and maize is a common problem, particularly in temperate regions of the world. As noted in a 2003 medical review, \\"The government research highlighted, if nothing else, that natural mycotoxicoses were an important health hazard in Southeast Asia.\\" = Reliability of eyewitness accounts = In 1987, the New York Times reported that Freedom of Information requests showed that field investigations in 1983‚Äì85 by US government teams had produced no evidence to substantiate the initial allegations and instead cast doubt on the reliability of the initial reports, but these critical reports were not released to the public. A 1989 analysis of the initial reports gathered from Hmong refugees that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association noted \\"marked inconsistencies that greatly compromised the validity of the testimony\\" and criticized the methods used in interviews by the US Army medical team that gathered this information. These issues included the US Army team only interviewing those people who claimed to have knowledge of attacks with chemical weapons and the investigators asking leading questions during interviews. The authors noted that individuals' stories changed over time, were inconsistent with other accounts, and that the people who claimed to have been eyewitnesses when first interviewed later stated that they had been relaying the accounts of others. In 1982, Meselson had visited a Hmong refugee camp with samples of bee droppings that he had collected in Thailand. Most of the Hmong he interviewed claimed that these were samples of the chemical weapons that they had been attacked with. One man accurately identified them as insect droppings, but switched to the chemical weapons story after discussion with fellow Hmong. Australian military scientist Rod Barton visited Thailand in 1984, and discovered that Thai villagers were blaming yellow rain for a variety of ailments, including scabies. An American doctor in Bangkok explained that the United States had been taking a special interest in yellow rain, and was providing medical care to alleged victims. = Possible U.S. origin = A CIA report from the 1960s reported allegations by the Cambodian government that their forces had been attacked with chemical weapons, leaving behind a yellow powder. The Cambodians blamed the United States for these alleged chemical attacks. Some of the samples of \\"yellow rain\\" collected from Cambodia in 1983 tested positive for CS, which the United States had used during the Vietnam War. CS is a form of tear gas and is not acutely toxic, but may account for some of the milder symptoms reported by the Hmong villagers. Disputed conclusions Currently, two main viewpoints exist on the yellow rain controversy. One viewpoint sees these allegations as supported by insufficient evidence, or as having been completely refuted. For instance, a 1992 review published in Politics and the Life Sciences described the idea of yellow rain as a biological agent as conclusively disproved and called for an assessment by the US government of the mistakes made in this episode, stating that \\"the present approach of sweeping the matter under the rug and hoping people will forget about it could be counterproductive.\\" Similarly, a 1997 review of the history of biological warfare published in the Journal of the American Medical Association stated that the yellow rain allegations are \\"widely regarded as erroneous\\", a 2001 review in the Annual Reviews in Microbiology described them as \\"unsubstantiated for many reasons\\", and a 2003 article in Annual Review of Phytopathology described them as \\"largely discredited\\". A 2003 review of the history of biological warfare described these allegations as one of many cases where states have produced propaganda containing false or unsubstantiated accusations of the use of biological weapons by their enemies. In contrast, as of 1997 the U.S. Army maintains that some experts believe that \\"trichothecenes were used as biological weapons in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan\\" although they write that \\"it has not been possible for the United States to prove unequivocally that trichothecene mycotoxins were used as biological weapons.\\" They argued that presence of pollen in yellow rain samples is best explained by the idea that \\"during biological warfare attacks, dispersed trichothecenes landed in pollen- containing areas.\\" (Essentially the same position is taken in a subsequent volume in the same series of U.S. Army textbooks published in 2007.) Similarly, the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency argues that the controversy has not been resolved and states that a CIA report indicated the Soviet Union did possess weapons based on T-2 mycotoxin, although the agency states that \\"no trace of a trichothecene-containing weapon was ever found in the areas affected by yellow rain\\" and concludes that the use of such weapons \\"may never be unequivocally proved.\\"A Note from History: Yellow Rain Defense Threat Reduction Agency A 2007 review published in Politics and the Life Sciences concluded that the balance of evidence strongly supported the hypothesis that some type of chemical or biological weapon was used in Southeast Asia in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but noted that they found no definitive proof of this hypothesis and that the evidence could not \\"identify the specific agents used, the intent, or the root source or sources of the attacks.\\" The Vietnamese and the Soviets have also reportedly used other chemical weapons in conflict, in Cambodia and Afghanistan, respectively.Michael Johns, \\"Seventy Years of Evil\\", Policy Review, September 1987, p.22.The Story of Genocide in Afghanistan Hassan KakarReport from Afghanistan Claude Malhuret  Later events  = India = An episode of mass pollen release from bees in 2002 in Sangrampur, India, prompted unfounded fears of a chemical weapons attack, although this was in fact due to a mass migration of giant Asian honeybees. This event revived memories of what New Scientist described as \\"cold war paranoia\\", and the article noted that the Wall Street Journal had covered these 1980s yellow rain allegations in particular detail. Indeed, the Wall Street Journal continues to assert that the Soviet Union used yellow rain as a chemical weapon in the 1980s and in 2003 accused Matthew Meselson of \\"excusing away evidence of Soviet violations.\\" = Iraq = In the build-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq the Wall Street Journal alleged that Saddam Hussein possessed a chemical weapon called \\"yellow rain\\". The Iraqis appear to have investigated trichothecene mycotoxins in 1990, but only purified a total of 20 ml of the agent from fungal cultures and did not manage to scale up the purification or produce any weapons containing these compounds. Although these toxins are not generally regarded as practical tactical weapons, the T-2 toxin might be a usable weapon since it can be absorbed through the skin, although it would be very difficult to manufacture it in any reasonable quantity. Henry Wilde, a retired US Foreign Service Officer, has drawn parallels between the use of yellow rain allegations by the US government against the Soviet Union and the later exaggerated allegations on the topic of Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. Wilde considers it likely that states may again \\"use rumors and false or planted intelligence of such weapons use for propaganda purposes.\\" and calls for the establishment of a more rigorous inspection process to deal with such claims. Similar concerns were expressed in a 2006 review published by the World Organisation for Animal Health, which compared the American yellow rain accusations to other Cold War-era accusations from the Soviet Union and Cuba, as well as to more recent mistaken intelligence on Iraqi weapons capabilities, concluding that such unjustified accusations have encouraged the development of biological weapons and increased the risk that they might be used, as they have discredited arms-control efforts. = Radiolab interview = In 2012 the science-themed show Radiolab aired an interview with Hmong refugee Eng Yang and his niece, author Kao Kalia Yang, to discuss Eng Yang's experience with yellow rain. The hosts took the position that yellow rain was unlikely to have been a chemical agent. The episode prompted a backlash among some listeners, who criticized Robert Krulwich for insensitivity, racism, and their disregard for Yang's personal and professional experience with the region in question. The negative response prompted host Krulwich to issue an apology for his handling of the interview. = Bulgaria = On 23 May 2015, just before the national holiday of 24 May (the day of Bulgarian writing and culture), yellow rain fell in Sofia, Bulgaria. Suspicions were raised because the Bulgarian government was criticizing Russian actions in Ukraine at the time. The Bulgarian national academy BAN explained the event as flower pollen.

The United States Lighthouse Board was the second agency of the US Federal Government, under the Department of Treasury, responsible for the construction and maintenance of all lighthouses and navigation aids in the United States, between 1852 and 1910. The new agency was created following complaints of the shipping industry of the previous administration of lighthouses under the Treasury's Lighthouse Establishment, which had had jurisdiction since 1791, and since 1820, been under the control of Stephen Pleasonton. The quasi-military board first met on April 28, 1851, and with its establishment, the administration of lighthouses and other aids to navigation would take their largest leap toward modernization since the inception of federal government control.Amy K. Marshall \\"Frequently Close to the Point of Peril: A History of Buoys and Tenders in U.S. Coastal Waters, 1789‚Äì1939\\", A Master's Thesis In 1910, the Lighthouse Board was disestablished in favor of a more civilian Lighthouse Service, under the Department of Commerce; later the Lighthouse Service was merged into the United States Coast Guard in 1939.  Establishment of the board  By 1847, the United States Congress became serious about reforming the Lighthouse Establishment which had been in existence since 1791 and in response to a number of complaints, the U.S. Congress removed the responsibility for the construction of six new light stations from the U.S. Treasury Department's Fifth Auditor (Stephen Pleasonton), and transferred it to the supervision of the United States Army's, long-time construction agency, the Corps of Engineers. When it became clear that this would not alleviate the underlying problems in the Lighthouse Establishment, Congress then felt compelled to deal the final blow to Pleasanton's administration. The ensuing congressional investigation took more than four years to effect a change in the administration of navigation aids along the American coasts. During that time, congressional appointee, Lt. Jenkins of the U.S. Coast Survey conducted interviews with pilots and mariners, engaged in domestic and foreign research, and was involved in a number of hearings into existing navigational aids administration. On March 3, 1851, the U.S. Congress passed \\"An Act Making Appropriations for Light House, Light Boats, Buoys, &c.;\\" Section 8 of the act stated: > The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and required to cause a board to > be convened at as early a day as may be practical after the passage of that > act to be two officers of the Navy of high rank, two officers of Engineers > of the Army, and such civil officers of scientific attainments as may be > under the orders or at the disposition of the Treasury Department, and a > junior officer of the Navy to act as Secretary to said board, whose duty it > shall be under instructions from the Treasury Department to inquire into the > condition of the Lighthouse Establishment of the United States, and make a > general detailed report and programme to guide legislation in extending and > improving our present system of construction, illumination, inspection, and > superintendence. The Lighthouse Board resulted from this mandate, and its original members consisted of William B. Shubrick, and Samuel F. Du Pont, U.S. Navy; James Kearney, U.S. Topographical Engineers; civilian academics Alexander Dallas Bache, Superintendent of the U.S. Coast Survey and Joseph Henry, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,; and Lt. Thornton Jenkins, U.S. Navy, who acted as Secretary.  Later developments  These men attracted others of similar quality to lighthouse duty, both on the board and in district offices. The country was organized into 12 lighthouse districts, each having an inspector (a naval officer) who was charged with building the lighthouses and seeing that they remained in good condition and that the lens was in operation. After a few years the inspectors became overloaded with work and an engineer (an army officer) was appointed to each district to tend to the construction and maintenance of lighthouses. The Lighthouse Board moved quickly in applying new technology, particularly in purchasing and installing new Fresnel lenses and constructing screw-pile lighthouses. The Board also oversaw the construction of the first lighthouses on the west coast. By the time of the Civil War, all lighthouses had Fresnel lenses. Previously, under the Establishment, the local collectors of customs were in charge of the lighthouses and other aids to navigation. In time, all duties regarding aids to navigation were taken from them. The Board demanded that only those who could read were to be appointed as keepers in order that they be able to read their written instructions. These instructions were detailed and covered everything possible about the operation of lighthouses, leaving little discretion to the keeper. The Board struggled to eliminate politics from its activities, and slowly the organization became a professional career agency, helped greatly by the Civil Service Reform Acts of 1871 and 1883. Keepers became civil service employees in 1896. Most important, the Board was constantly mindful of advancing technology and took advantage of new types of lighthouses, buoys, or fog signals, as well as improvement in lighthouse optics. Over the next five decades several advances in lighthouse construction technology took place including the development of the exposed screwpile lighthouses, exoskeleton lighthouses, waveswept interlocking stone lighthouses, iron caisson lighthouses, and breakwater lighthouses. In the 1850s the Board prescribed color schemes for the buoys, as well as range lights and day markers; and the buoy system was standardized. Classification systems were also developed to mark the nation's waterways. Iron buoys were introduced to replace the more expensive copper-clad wooden buoys. The Lighthouse Board also began printing changes made in aids to navigation as a Notice to Mariners. Several advances in the technology of fog signals were made during the 1850s. In 1851, an experimental air fog whistle and reed horn was installed at Beavertail Lighthouse at the entrance to Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. At first this sound signal was powered by a horse-operated treadmill and later by an internal combustion steam engine. Around 1851, mechanically rung fog bells were introduced. The striking mechanism was governed by a weight attached to a flywheel, and later internally run by clockworks. The strokes of the fog signals were timed deliberately to afford each signal a unique sound characteristic. The bell signal was gradually replaced by three variations of that instrument. The first was an ordinary locomotive whistle, enlarged and modified and blown by steam from a high-pressure tubular boiler. The second was a reed-trumpet, and in 1866 the third variation, a siren-trumpet. Although the fog bell signal was still used for warning vessels over short distances, other fog signals started to supersede the smaller bell signal. Bells were also used on buoys; later whistling buoys were invented by J. M. Courtenay and were first in use in 1876. The first gas-lighted buoy was installed in 1882. The gong buoy was invented in 1923. In 1886, a new technology was tested in the illumination of the Statue of Liberty‚Äîelectricity. The electrical lighting of the statue, under the Lighthouse Board's care from 1886 to 1902, marks the beginning of the \\"modern age\\" in lighthouse illumination. In 1900, the Lighthouse Board began converting lighthouses to electric service; however, because of the lack of direct access to power lines, the conversion came about slowly.

She was the de facto ruler of Ray during the reign of her son, Majd al-Dawla (r. 997‚Äì1029).  Origins  Map of northern Iran According to the medieval historian Hilal al-Sabi' and the modern historian Madelung, Sayyida Shirin was the sister of the Bavandid ruler al-Marzuban. However, according to the Qabus-nama made by the Ziyarid ruler Keikavus (who was a neighbor of the Bavandids and of Bavandid descent himself), Sayyida Shirin was the niece of al-Marzuban. Hugh N. Kennedy calls her the daughter of a certain Bavandid ruler (ispahbadh) of Tabaristan named Sharwin, who may be the Bavandid ruler Sharwin III, who was the brother of al- Marzuban. Sayyida Shirin also had a brother named Rustam Dushmanziyar, whose son Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar became the founder of the Kakuyid dynasty. Although Sayyida is called a Kurd in some sources, she is generally agreed to be from the Bavand dynasty, which was then of Daylamite origin. Encyclop√¶dia Iranica also states that; ‚Äúit should be remembered that ‚ÄúKurd‚Äù in the sources of the 10th-11th centuries refers to all the transhumants of the Zagros region including the Lors.‚Äù  Biography  At an unknown date, Sayyida Shirin married Fakhr al-Dawla, and bore him two sons named Abu Taleb Rostam and Abu Taher in the 990s. Fakhr al-Dawla later died in 997 and was in Ray succeeded by Abu Taleb Rostam, who was given the laqab of \\"Majd al-Dawla\\". Meanwhile, Abu Taher was given the laqab of \\"Shams al-Dawla\\", and became the ruler of Hamadan. Since both brothers were in the age of minority, power was assumed by Sayyida. Both sons initially declared themselves independent and assumed the title of Sh√¢hansh√¢h, but by 1009 or 1010 at the latest had recognized the authority of their relative Baha' al-Dawla, who controlled Fars and Iraq, and abandoned the title. In 1006 or 1007, with the assistance of his vizier Abu 'Ali ibn 'Ali, Majd al-Dawla attempted to throw off the regency of Sayyida. Sayyida, however, escaped to the Kurd Abu Najr Badr ibn Hasanuya, and together with Shams al-Dawla they put Ray under siege. After several battles, the city was taken and Majd al-Dawla was captured. He was imprisoned by Sayyida in the fort of Tabarak, while Shams al-Dawla took to power in Ray. After a year, Majd al-Dawla was released and reinstated in Ray; Shams al-Dawla returned to Hamadan. Power continued to be held by his mother. However, Shams al-Dawla later tried to seize Ray from Majd al-Dawla, but was stopped by Sayyida. Sayyida later died in 1028.

Bettas are a member of the gourami family and are known to be highly territorial. Males in particular are prone to high levels of aggression and will attack each other if housed in the same tank. If there is no means of escape, this will usually result in the death of one or both of the fish. Female bettas can also become territorial towards each other if they are placed in too small an aquarium. It is typically not recommended to keep male and female bettas together, except temporarily for breeding purposes which should always be undertaken with caution. This species is native to the Mekong basin of Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam and is mostly concentrated in the Chao Phraya river in Thailand. The fish can be found in standing waters of canals, rice paddies and floodplains. It is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. On 5 February 2019, Thailand's council of ministers confirmed \\"Siamese fighting fish\\" as Thailand's national aquatic animal. Description B. splendens usually grows to a length of about . Although aquarium specimens are widely known for their brilliant colors and large, flowing fins, the natural coloration of B. splendens is generally green, brown and grey, and the fins of wild specimens are short. In the wild, they exhibit strong colors only when agitated. In captivity, they have been selectively bred to display a vibrant array of colors and tail types.  Conservation status  Although popular as an aquarium fish, the IUCN has classified B. splendens in the vulnerable category. The fish is naturally endemic to Thailand and can be found in shallow areas in marshes or paddy fields. The primary threat is due to habitat destruction and pollution, as farmlands continue to be developed across central Thailand. Diet Betta splendens feed on zooplankton, crustaceans, and the larvae of mosquitoes and other water-bound insects. In captivity they can be fed a varied diet of pellets or frozen foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, daphnia and many others. Reproduction and early development A pair spawning under a bubble nest in a breeder's tank One-day-old larvae (their yolk sacs have not yet been absorbed) in a bubble nest Betta splendens fish build bubble nests of varying sizes. velvet disease), a common killer of betta fry in captivity. Male bettas will flare their gills, spread their fins and twist their bodies in a dance if interested in a female. If the female is also interested she will darken in color and develop vertical lines known as breeding bars as a response. Males build bubble nests of various sizes and thicknesses at the surface of the water. Most tend to do this regularly even if there is no female present. Plants or rocks that break the surface often form a base for bubble nests. The act of spawning itself is called a \\"nuptial embrace\\", for the male wraps his body around the female; around 10‚Äì40 eggs are released during each embrace, until the female is exhausted of eggs. The male, in his turn, releases milt into the water, and fertilization takes place externally. During and after spawning, the male uses his mouth to retrieve sinking eggs and deposit them in the bubble nest (during mating the female sometimes assists her partner, but more often she simply devours all the eggs she manages to catch). Once the female has released all of her eggs, she is chased away from the male's territory, as she will likely eat the eggs. If she is not removed from the tank then she will most likely be killed by the male. The eggs will remain in the male's care. He carefully keeps them in his bubble nest, making sure none fall to the bottom, repairing the bubble nest as needed. Incubation lasts for 24‚Äì36 hours; newly hatched larvae remain in the nest for the next two to three days until their yolk sacs are fully absorbed. Afterwards, the fry leave the nest and the free-swimming stage begins. In this first period of their lives, B. splendens fry are totally dependent on their gills; the labyrinth organ which allows the species to breathe atmospheric oxygen typically develops at three to six weeks of age, depending on the general growth rate, which can be highly variable. B. splendens can reach sexual maturity at an age as early as 4‚Äì5 months. History =Fighting fish= Some people of Thailand and Malaysia are known to have collected these fish prior to the 19th century from the wild which are line-bred for aggression in eastern Thailand. In the wild, betta spar for only a few minutes before one fish backs off. Bred specifically for heightened aggression, domesticated betta matches can go on for much longer, with winners determined by a willingness to continue fighting. Once a fish retreats, the match is over. Seeing the popularity of these fights, the king of Thailand, Rama III, started licensing and collecting these fighting fish. In 1840, he gave some of his prized fish to a man who, in turn, gave them to Theodore Edward Cantor, a medical scientist. Nine years later, Cantor wrote an article describing them under the name Macropodus pugnax. In 1909, the ichthyologist Charles Tate Regan, upon realizing a species was already named Macropodus pugnax, renamed the domesticated Siamese fighting fish Betta splendens. The vernacular name \\"plakat\\", often applied to the short-finned ornamental strains, is derived from the Thai word pla kat (Thai: ‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏î), which literally means \\"biting fish\\" and is the Thai name for all members of the B. splendens species complex (as all members have aggressive tendencies in the wild and all are extensively line-bred for aggression in eastern Thailand) rather than for any specific strain(s) of the Siamese fighting fish. So the term \\"fighting fish\\" comes in use to generalize all the members of the B. splendens species complex including the Siamese fighting fish. =Aquarium fish= In 1892, this species was imported to France by the French aquarium fish importer Pierre Carbonnier in Paris, and in 1896, the German aquarium fish importer Paul Matte in Berlin imported the first specimens to Germany from Moscow. =Invasive species= In January 2014 a large population of the fish was discovered in the Adelaide River Floodplain in the Northern Territory, Australia. As an invasive species they pose a threat to native fish, frogs and other wetland wildlife. In the aquarium = Water = Betta species prefer a water temperature of around but have been seen to survive temporarily at the extremes of or . When kept in colder climates, aquarium heaters are recommended. Bettas are also affected by the pH levels of the water. Ideal levels for Bettas would be at a neutral pH (7.0) However, Bettas are slightly tolerant towards the pH levels. They have an organ known as the labyrinth organ which allows them to breathe air at the water's surface. This organ was thought to allow the fish to be kept in unmaintained aquaria, but this is a misconception, as poor water quality makes all tropical fish, including Betta splendens, more susceptible to diseases such as fin rot. Properly kept and fed a correct diet, Siamese fighting fish generally live between 3 and 5 years in captivity, but may live between 7 and 10 years in rare cases. = Aquarium size and cohabitants = The minimum tank size is directly related to how experienced the fish keeper is, and how often they want to carry out water changes, in order to keep the water pristine. The Betta must of course have enough room to turn around, but there is no evidence that they require a lot of space. Due to their labyrinth organ they are not dependent on high oxygen levels in the water, so a large surface area for gas exchange is not required. Some Betta enthusiasts claim that there is a minimum tank size for a Betta, but to try to set a strict baseline minimum is somewhat arbitrary.. Reliably performing regular partial water changes (every other day for small unfiltered tanks) would at least ensure the water quality in a smaller tank is acceptable. Most consider 9 to 19 litres ( 3 - 5 US gallons) to be an ideal tank size for a Betta,\\"but you can successfully keep a Betta in a 4 litre (1 gallon) tank provided you clean it regularly\\" and maintain an acceptable temperature (generally 24¬∞C to 26¬∞C - 75F to 78F - is considered optimal). Bettas can cohabit with fish that are bottom feeders, however it is not advised to keep them with feeders that may eat their fins or destroy the slime coat (one example is the Siamese Algae Eater, if kept in an inappropriately sized tank) =Varieties= B. splendens can be hybridized with B. imbellis, B. mahachaiensis, and B. smaragdina, though with the latter, the fry tend to have low survival rates. In addition to these hybrids within the genus Betta, intergeneric hybridizing of Betta splendens and Macropodus opercularis, the paradise fish, has been reported. Breeders around the world continue to develop new varieties. Often, the males of the species are sold preferentially in stores because of their beauty, compared to the females. Females almost never develop fins as showy as males of the same type and are often more subdued in coloration, though some breeders manage to get females with fairly long fins and bright colors. =Colors= A dalmatian orange male Wild fish exhibit strong colours only when agitated. Breeders have been able to make this coloration permanent, and a wide variety of hues breed true. Colours available to the aquarist include red, orange, yellow, blue, steel blue, turquoise/green, black, pastel, white (\\"opaque\\" white, not to be confused with albino) and multi-coloured fish. Bettas are found in many different colours due to different layers of pigmentation in their skin. The layers (from furthest within to the outer layer) consists of red, yellow, black, iridescent (blue and green), and metallic (not a colour of its own, but reacts with the other colours to change how they are perceived). Any combination of these layers can be present, leading to a wide variety of colours. The shades of blue, turquoise, and green are slightly iridescent, and can appear to change colour with different lighting conditions or viewing angles; this is because these colours (unlike black or red) are not due to pigments, but created through refraction within a layer of translucent guanine crystals. Breeders have also developed different colour patterns such as marble and butterfly, as well as metallic shades through hybridization like copper, gold, or platinum (these were obtained by crossing B. splendens to other Betta species). Purple and blue female A true albino betta has been feverishly sought since one recorded appearance in 1927, and another in 1953. Neither of these was able to establish a line of true albinos. In 1994, a hobbyist named Kenjiro Tanaka claimed to have successfully bred albino bettas. Some bettas will change colours throughout their lifetime (known as marbling), attributed to a transposon. Koi bettas have mutated now and some are no longer marbles and do not change colors or patterns through out their lifetime (known as true Koi) attributed to the defective gene that causes marbling not being repaired in the color layers after a time. _Common Colours_ * Super Red * Super Blue Super Yellow PKHM * Super Yellow * Opaque * Super Black * Super White Cellophane BigEar betta From Thailand *Orange *Marble *Candy *Nemo *Galaxy Nemo *Koi *Alien *Copper *Cellophane Super Orange PKHM *Gold *Galaxy Koi _Rarer Colours_ * Super Orange * Metallic * Turquoise * Lavender * Mustard Gas * Grizzle * Green = Colour patterns = A male betta * Solid ‚Äì The entire fish is one colour with no variations * Bi-colour ‚Äì The fins must be a different colour to the body to be a Bi-colour. * Cambodian ‚Äì The body is pale, almost colourless, and the fins are a solid colour * Butterfly ‚Äì The fins have distinct bands of colours * Marble ‚Äì Irregular patterns throughout the body and fin * Piebald ‚Äì pale flesh-coloured face irrespective of the body colour. * Full Mask ‚Äì the face being the same colour as the body rather than what it would naturally be which would be darker than the body * Dragon ‚Äì rich strong base colour with the scales on the main part of the body a pale iridescent * Multicolour ‚Äì 3 or more colours on the body that does not fit into any other pattern category * Pastel ‚Äì A light shade of colour seen only on the fins, body remains a flesh hue. *Koi - Koi are judged from the top down and look like their carp counterparts.

They are one step closer to the Halfmoon variety in that their tails have a span between 130 -170 degrees * Half-sun - combtail with caudal fin going 180¬∞, like a half-moon * Elephant ear - pectoral fins are much larger than normal, often white, resembling the ears of an elephant * Spade tail - caudal fin has a wide base that narrows to a small point Behavior A male attacking and flaring at his reflection in a mirror Males and females flare or puff out their gill covers (opercula) to appear more impressive, either to intimidate other rivals or as an act of courtship. Other reasons for flaring can include when they are intimidated by movement or change of scene in their environments. Both sexes display pale horizontal bars if stressed or frightened. However, such colour changes, common in females of any age, are rare in mature males due to their intensity of colour. Females often flare at other females, especially when setting up a pecking order. Flirting fish behave similarly, with vertical instead of horizontal stripes indicating a willingness and readiness to breed (females only). Betta splendens enjoy a decorated tank, being a territorial fish it is necessary to establish territory even when housed alone. They may set up a territory centered on a plant or rocky alcove, sometimes becoming highly possessive of it and aggressive toward trespassing rivals. This is the reason why when kept with other fish the minimum tank size should be 45 litres (about 10 gallons). Contrary to popular belief, bettas are compatible with many other species of aquarium fish. Given the proper parameters bettas will be known to only be aggressive towards smaller and slower fish than themselves such as guppies. The aggression of this fish has been studied by ethologists and comparative psychologists. These fish have historically been the objects of gambling; two male fish are pitted against each other to fight and bets are placed on which one will win. One fish will arise the victor, the fight continuing until one participant is submissive. These competitions can result in the death of either one or both fish depending on the seriousness of their injuries. To avoid fights over territory, male Siamese fighting fish are best isolated from one another. Males will occasionally even respond aggressively to their own reflections in a mirror. Though this is obviously safer than exposing the fish to another male, prolonged sight of their reflection may lead to stress in some individuals. Not all Siamese fighting fish respond negatively to other males, especially when the tank is large enough for each fish to create their own designated territory. community tank with mollies and rainbowfish =Aggressive behavior in females= In general, studies have shown that females exhibit similar aggressive behaviors as their male counterparts, but these behaviors are less common. A group of female Siamese fighting fish were observed over a period of two weeks. During these two weeks, the following behaviors were recorded: attacking, displays, and biting food. The results of this observational study indicated that when females are housed in small groups, they form a stable dominance order. For example, the fish who was ranked at the top showed higher levels of mutual displays, in comparison to the fish who were of lower ranks. The researchers also found that the duration of the displays differed depending on whether an attack occurred. The results of these studies indicate that female Siamese fighting fish should be considered as often as males, as there are evidently interesting variations in their behaviors as well. =Courtship behavior= There has been numerous research in the area of courtship behavior between male and female Siamese fighting fish. This research has focused on the aggressive behaviors of males during the courtship process. For example, one study found that when male fish are in the bubble nest phase, their aggression toward females is quite low. This is due to the males attempting to attract potential mates to their nest, so eggs can successfully be laid. It has also been found that in regards to mate choice, females often ‚Äúeavesdrop‚Äù on pairs of male Siamese fighting fish while they are fighting. When females witness aggressive behavior between a pair of males, the female is more likely to be attracted to the male who won. In contrast, if a female did not ‚Äúeavesdrop‚Äù on aggressive behavior between a pair of males, the female will show no preference in mate choice. In regards to the male fish, the ‚Äúloser‚Äù fish are more likely to attempt to court the fish who did not ‚Äúeavesdrop‚Äù. The ‚Äúwinner‚Äù fish have been found to show no preference in regards to female fish who ‚Äúeavesdropped‚Äù and those who did not. One study considered the ways in which male Siamese fighting fish alter their behaviors during courtship when another male is present. During this experiment, a dummy female was placed in the tank. The researchers expected that males would conceal their courtship from intruders, however this surprisingly was not the case. It was found that when another male fish was present, the male was more likely to engage in courtship behaviors with the dummy female fish. When no barriers were present, the males were more likely to engage in gill flaring at an intruder male fish. Therefore, the researchers conclude that the male is attempting to court the female and communicate with the rival male present at the same time. These results indicate the importance of considering courtship behavior, as the literature has suggested there are many factors that can dramatically affect the ways in which both male and females can act in courtship settings. =Metabolic costs of aggression= Studies have found that Siamese fighting fish often begin with behaviors that require high cost, and gradually decrease their behaviors as the encounter proceeds. This indicates that Siamese fighting fish will first begin an encounter using much metabolic energy, but will gradually decrease, as to not use too much energy, thus making the encounter a waste if the fish is not successful. Similarly, researchers have found that when pairs of male Siamese fighting fish were kept together in the same tank for a three-day period, aggressive behavior was most prevalent during the mornings of the first two days of their cohabitation. However the researchers observed that the fighting between the two males decreased as the day progressed. The male in the dominant position initially had metabolic advantage; although as the experiment progressed, both fish became equal in regards to metabolic advantages. In regards to oxygen consumption, one study found that when two male Siamese fighting fish fought, the metabolic rates of both fish did not differ before or during the fight. However, the fish who won showed higher oxygen consumption during the evening subsequent to the fight. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that aggressive behavior in the form of fighting has long-lasting effects on metabolism. =Effects of chemical exposure on behavior= Chemicals such as hormones can have powerful effects on the behavior of an individual. Researchers have considered the effect that such chemicals can have on Siamese fighting fish. This section will examine three studies, each of which indicates that chemicals can significantly affect the behaviors of Siamese fighting fish. In particular, these behavior changes are most likely to occur in regards to aggression. One study investigated the effect of testosterone on female Siamese fighting fish. Females were first given testosterone, which resulted in physical changes. This included fin length, body coloration and gonads. These physical changes resulted in the females resembling typical male fish. Next their aggressive behavior was monitored. It was found that when these females interacted with other females, their aggression increased. In contrast, when the females interacted with males, their aggressive behavior decreased. The researchers then allowed the female fish to interact socially with a group of other female fish, who had not been exposed to testosterone. It was found that when the female fish stopped receiving testosterone, those who were exposed to the female fish still exhibited the male typical behaviors. In contrast, the female fish who were kept isolated did not continue to exhibit the male typical behaviors after testosterone was discontinued. Another study exposed male Siamese fighting fish to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The researchers were curious if exposure to these chemicals would affect the ways in which females respond to the exposed males. It was found that when shown videos of the exposed males, the females favored those who were not exposed to the endocrine- disrupting chemicals, and avoided those male who were exposed. Therefore, the researchers concluded that exposure to these chemicals can negatively affect the mating success of male Siamese fighting fish. The last study investigated the effect of the SSRI, fluoxetine, on male Siamese fighting fish. It has been previously found that this chemical reduces aggressive behavior; therefore, researchers were curious if this would occur in their experiment. As predicted, it was found that when exposed to fluoxetine, male Siamese fighting fish exhibited less aggressive behavior than they would have if they had not been exposed to the chemical. Name Although commonly called a betta in the aquarium trade, especially in North America, that is the name of a genus not only containing this fish, but also other species. B. splendens is more accurately called by its scientific name or \\"Siamese fighting fish\\", to avoid confusion with the other species in the genus. In popular culture *The Fisheries Department of Thailand is promoting pla kat, or Siamese fighting fish, as the national fish. Department chief Adisorn Promthep said that the proposal will be submitted to the National Identity Office under the Prime Minister's Office for approval. He said that once the status is recognised, fighting fish farming would be promoted, which would generate money and create jobs. He added that credible records show that pla kat of the Betta splendens species are native to Thailand and were first collected for fighting during the reign of King Rama III. *The titular character in the novel Rumble Fish and subsequent film adaptation is a Siamese fighting fish. In both, the character Motorcycle Boy is fascinated with the creatures and dubs them \\"rumble fish\\". He speculates that if the fish were to be set free in the river, they wouldn't behave so aggressively. A common misconception regarding keeping B. splendens is that they should live in vases or bowls. However, this has been proven to damage their health, life expectancy, and cause negative behavioral changes. *A scene in the James Bond film From Russia with Love shows three Siamese fighting fish in an aquarium as the villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld likens the modus operandi of his criminal organisation, SPECTRE, to one of the fish that observes as the other two fight to the death, then kills the weakened victor.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 19, 1997. It was written by Jennifer Crittenden and directed by Chuck Sheetz. The episode guest stars Jack Lemmon as Frank Ormand and Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony. In the episode, Marge starts her own pretzels business. Plot The Springfield Investorettes -- Maude Flanders, Helen Lovejoy, Agnes Skinner, Luann Van Houten and Edna Krabappel -- expel Marge from their investment group because she is wary of high-risk ventures. The group returns Marge's $500 initial investment and Lisa convinces her to use the money to buy her own franchise. To compete with the Investorettes' Fleet-A-Pita franchise, Marge buys a Pretzel Wagon, franchised by its owner, Frank Ormand. Marge parks her Pretzel Wagon outside the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and Homer persuades his coworkers to patronize it. The Investorettes' Fleet-A-Pita van parks nearby and lures away Marge's customers. To drum up business, the Pretzel Wagon sponsors Free Pretzel Day at the Springfield Isotopes baseball stadium. Before fans can consume their pretzels, they learn that Mr. Burns has won a 1997 Pontiac Astro Wagon when an announcement blares from a loudspeaker. The fans react angrily to the news and bombard the field with pretzels, knocking out Whitey Ford. Marge's efforts end in vain again and she becomes deeply depressed, so Homer searches for someone who can help her. After discovering that Frank Ormand has died in a car accident along with the executor of his estate, Homer establishes a secret business agreement with Fat Tony, the Springfield Mafia don. The next day, Marge receives a surprisingly large order for pretzels, reinvigorating the Pretzel Wagon. The mob drives several of Marge's competitors out of business through intimidation, eventually destroying the Investorettes' Fleet-A-Pita van with a car bomb. Soon, Marge receives an order to be delivered to a remote location on the outskirts of town, where she is approached by Fat Tony and his gang. He informs her of the deal he made with Homer and claims that he is entitled to a 100% stake of Marge's profits. Marge confronts Homer and he explains that he was only trying to help. She then refuses to pay Fat Tony and continues making pretzels. As the mob advances on Marge, the Investorettes arrive with the Japanese yakuza to counter Marge's alliance with Fat Tony. The rival gangs get into a brutal fight and the Simpsons retreat into their house. Marge forgives Homer for meddling and making the situation worse, and instructs the kids to go back to bed when they overhear the racket caused by the gangs. Production The main plot of the episode concerning the two rival snack food franchises was selected because at the time of production, pita bread and pretzels were \\"becoming popular\\". Josh Weinstein expressed his wish that the ideas had been changed to something more \\"fun\\", as both snacks have since \\"gone out of fashion\\". The Fleet-A-Pita chef was an early version of the \\"Khlav-Kalash\\" man from \\"The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson\\". At the Expo, many of the franchises were based on real franchises and get-rich-quick schemes. In the scene where Homer is inspecting pretzels, there was originally a shot where he gave a thumbs down to Maggie's pretzel. The episode was written by Jennifer Crittenden who wrote four other episodes. Homer's line \\"Yeah, Homer's right\\" during the scene where the pretzel wagon arrives was ad-libbed by Dan Castellaneta. In another scene, Cletus calls for his many children to come out of the house; the names of which were all \\"trendy names from the nineties\\". The 1997 Pontiac Astrowagon that Mr. Burns wins was designed to accurately resemble the GM minivans on sale at the time. The episode's final scene, the mob war, was conceived by Matt Groening as no one else could come up with an ending. Cultural references Guest star Jack Lemmon's portrayal of Frank Ormand was based on his role in Glengarry Glen Ross. The scene in which the Springfield Mafia destroy all of the competition to \\"Pretzel Wagon\\" is based on a scene from Goodfellas. Frank Ormand's \\"You'll be there\\" speech mirrors that of Tom Joad from John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. Lemmon's portrayal of Frank Ormand is based on the character Shelley Levene from the film Glengarry Glen Ross, also played by Lemmon. The character Gil Gunderson, who would not be introduced until the ninth season episode \\"Realty Bites\\", was also based on Levene. Rumer and Scout, two of Cletus's children, are named after Bruce Willis and Demi Moore's children. The scene where baseball fans cause a riot by throwing pretzels after Mr. Burns wins a new car, is based on an incident where the Los Angeles Dodgers were forced to forfeit. It happened on August 10, 1995, when the fans threw promotional baseballs onto the field to protest a bad call during the 9th inning.https://www.sbnation.com/2018/8/8/17661334/forfeits-professional- sports-wnba-aces-las-vegas Reception In its original broadcast, \\"The Twisted World of Marge Simpson\\" finished 55th in ratings for the week of January 13‚Äì19, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 8.2, equivalent to approximately 8.0 million viewing households. It was the fifth-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files, King of the Hill, Melrose Place, and Beverly Hills, 90210. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \\"A clever, and rather unusual, idea for an episode that shows a frightening bitchiness beneath the middle-class veneer of smalltown businesswomen.\\" The scene with Cletus's children is one of two scenes from this episode that Josh Weinstein considers to be \\"classic\\", with the second being the sequence when the crowd throw their free pretzels onto the baseball field, knocking Whitey Ford unconscious. The Ford scene was placed 24th on ESPN.com's list of the \\"Top 100 Simpsons sport moments\\", released in 2004. Greg Collins, the author of the list, added that \\"Every time it looks like a fight is about to start at a baseball game, I start quoting this scene.\\" The A.V. Club named the baseball commentator's line \\"Aaaannnd heeerrre come the pretzels\\" one of the quotes from The Simpsons that can be used in everyday situations.

Hardin has appeared in film and television roles, including the character nicknamed Deep Throat in The X-Files. Hardin was born in Texas and studied acting at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art before beginning his acting career in New York. He is married with two children, one of whom is actress Melora Hardin. Early life Jerry Hardin was born in Dallas on November 20, 1929. His father was a rancher, and Jerry spent his youth actively involved with his local church and performing in school plays. He attended Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, on a scholarship before going on to study at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, earning a scholarship there through the Fulbright Program. He spent several years there before returning to the United States to begin acting in New York, performing in regional theatre for twelve years.Lowry, pp. 91‚Äì94. Career Hardin began acting on television in the 1950s, mostly in character roles. He amassed over a hundred appearances by the early 1990s, in addition to more than seventy-five theatrical credits by the early 1960s.Lovece, p. 27. His television appearances include roles in the 1976 western series Sara, World War III, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Voyager, Sliders, and Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. Hardin appeared in such films as Thunder Road (1958), Our Time (1974),The Rockford Files (1977), Chilly Scenes of Winter (1979), 1941 (1979), Reds (1981), Missing (1982), Tempest (1982), Honkytonk Man (1982), Cujo (1983), Mass Appeal (1984), Warning Sign (1985), Big Trouble in Little China (1986), Let's Get Harry (1986), Wanted: Dead or Alive (1987), Little Nikita (1988), The Milagro Beanfield War (1988), Blaze (1989), The Hot Spot (1990), The Firm (1993). =Deep Throat= His role in 1993's The Firm won Hardin the attention of television writer Chris Carter, who cast him in the recurring role of Deep Throat in the series The X-Files.

He is the discoverer of the chemical element phosphorus. Biography The circumstances of Brand's birth are unknown but he was born in 1630 and died around 1692 or 1710. Some sources describe his origins as humble and indicate that he had been an apprentice glassmaker as a young man. However, correspondence by his second wife Margaretha states that he was of high social standing. In any case he held a post as a junior army officer during the Thirty Years' War and his first wife's dowry was substantial, allowing him to pursue alchemy on leaving the army. He was one of the many searchers for the philosopher's stone. In the process, he accidentally discovered phosphorus.  Alchemy  Like other alchemists of the time, Brand searched for the \\"philosopher's stone\\", a substance which supposedly transformed base metals (like lead) into gold. By the time his first wife died he had exhausted her money on this pursuit. He then married his second wife Margaretha, a wealthy widow whose financial resources allowed him to continue the search. Like many before him, he was interested in water and tried combining it with various other materials, in hundreds of combinations. He had seen for instance a recipe in a book 400 Auserlensene Chemische Process by F. T. Kessler of Strasbourg for using alum, saltpetre (potassium nitrate) and concentrated urine to turn base metals into silver (a recipe which did not work). Around 1669 he heated residues from boiled-down urine on his furnace until the retort was red hot, where all of a sudden glowing fumes filled it and liquid dripped out, bursting into flames. He could catch the liquid in a jar and cover it, where it solidified and continued to give off a pale-green glow. What he collected was phosphorus, which he named from the Greek word for \\"light-bearing\\" or \\"light-bearer.\\" Phosphorus must have been awe-inspiring to an alchemist: it was a product of man, and seeming to glow with a \\"life force\\" that did not diminish over time (and did not need re-exposure to light like the previously discovered Bologna Stone). Brand kept his discovery secret, as alchemists of the time did, and worked with the phosphorus trying unsuccessfully to use it to produce gold. His recipe was: * Boil urine to reduce it to a thick syrup. * Heat until a red oil distills up from it, and draw that off. * Allow the remainder to cool, where it consists of a black spongy upper part and a salty lower part. * Discard the salt, mix the red oil back into the black material. * Heat that mixture strongly for 16 hours. * First white fumes come off, then an oil, then phosphorus. * The phosphorus may be passed into cold water to solidify. The chemical reaction Brand stumbled on was as follows. Urine contains phosphates PO43‚àí, as sodium phosphate (i.e. with Na+) in the form of microcosmic salt, and various carbon- based organics. Under strong heat the oxygen atoms from the phosphate react with carbon to produce carbon monoxide CO, leaving elemental phosphorus P, which comes off as a gas. Phosphorus condenses to a liquid below about 280¬∞C and then solidifies (to the white phosphorus allotrope) below about 44¬∞C (depending on purity). This same essential reaction is still used today (but with mined phosphate ores, coke for carbon, and electric furnaces). Brand's process yielded far less phosphorus than it could have done. The salt part he discarded contained most of the phosphate. He used about 5,500 litres of urine to produce just 120 grams of phosphorus. If he had ground up the entire residue he could have got many times more than this (1 litre of adult human urine contains about 1.4g of phosphorus salts, which amounts to around 0.11 grams of pure white phosphorus).

He was born in Melbourne, Victoria, was educated at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and at the University of Melbourne where he earned his B.Sc. in 1923 and M.Sc. in 1925. In 1927 he began working at the Broken Hill Associated Smelters in Port Pirie, South Australia, becoming the assistant supervisor of research, and he remained there until 1929. He then joined the Mount Stromlo Observatory, then called the Commonwealth Solar Observatory, as an assistant and he remained associated with the observatory until his death in 1966. At Mount Stromlo, he took up the study of electrical phenomena in the atmosphere, including ionization in the lower atmosphere. He then transitioned into the study of cosmic rays. In 1933 he was married to Irene Doris Tyson (known as Yandell). The couple had two sons, Robert Ernest Tremayne b 1936 and Garth Richard b. 1940 and a daughter, Elizabeth Irene born 1946. Beginning in 1940, near the start of World War II, he worked as a physicist in the Chemical Defence Section at the Munitions Supply Laboratories in Maribyrnong. There his work was focused on the study of respirators. In 1944 he became secretary of the Physical and Meteorological Sub-Committee at the Lab. After the war he returned to work at observatory. He was awarded his Ph.D. in 1950 from the University of Melbourne, based on his study of cosmic rays. He now began astronomical studies using photoelectric photometry and produced a series of papers on eclipsing variables, globular clusters in the galaxy, and the magellanic clouds. He also became involved in the administration of the observatory and played a leading role in establishing the new telescope. Later he selected Siding Spring Mountain as the site of an telescope, located further from the encroaching growth near the older observatory. He was the deputy director of the Mount Stromlo Observatory from 1961 to 1966. Hogg served in other positions of note, including as president of the Royal Society of Canberra in 1954; chairman of the Australian Institute of Physics, Australian Capital Territory branch, 1964; and the Commission 6 on Astronomical Telegrams of the International Astronomical Union from 1961 until 1964.

English translations include \\"soul of language\\", \\"spirit of language\\", \\"power of language\\", \\"power word\\", \\"magic word\\", and \\"sacred sound\\". The notion of kotodama presupposes that sounds can magically affect objects, and that ritual word usages can influence our environment, body, mind, and soul. Basis This Japanese compound kotodama combines koto Ë®Ä \\"word; speech\\" and tama Èúä \\"spirit; soul\\" (or È≠Ç \\"soul; spirit; ghost\\") voiced as dama in rendaku. In contrast, the unvoiced kototama pronunciation especially refers to , which was popularized by Onisaburo Deguchi in the Oomoto religion. This field takes the Japanese goj≈´on phonology as the mystical basis of words and meanings, in rough analogy to Hebrew Kabbalah. Etymology The etymology of kotodama is uncertain, but one explanation correlating words and events links two Japanese words pronounced koto: this \\"word; words; speech\\" and ‰∫ã \\"situation; circumstances; state of affairs; occurrence; event; incident\\". These two kanji were used interchangeably in the name Kotoshironushi or , an oracular kami mentioned in the Kojiki and Nihon shoki. Kotodama is related with Japanese words such as kotoage \\"words raised up; invoke the magical power of words\\", kotomuke \\"directed words; cause submission though the power of words\\", and jumon \\"magic spell; magic words; incantation\\". Mythology Kotodama is a central concept in Japanese mythology, Shinto, and Kokugaku. For example, the Kojiki describes an ukei (or seiyaku) \\"covenant; trial by pledge\\" between the sibling gods Susanoo and Amaterasu, \\"Let each of us swear, and produce children\\". Uttering the divine words of the Shinto divination ritual known as ukehi supposedly determines results, and in this case, Amaterasu giving birth to five male deities proved that Susanoo's intentions were pure. Martial arts Kototama or kotodama is also fundamental to Japanese martial arts, for instance, in the use of kiai. Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of aikido and a student of Deguchi, used kototama as a spiritual basis for his teachings. William Gleason says Ueshiba \\"created aikido based on the kototama principle,\\" and quotes him that \\"Aikido is the superlative way to practice the kototama. It is the means by which one realizes his true nature as a god and finds ultimate freedom.\\" Mutsuro Nakazono, a disciple of Ueshiba, wrote books on the importance of kototama in aikido, such as The Kototama Principle in 1983. Equivalences While other cultures have parallels to kotodama, such as mantra, yanling, mana, and logos, some Japanese people believe the \\"word spirit\\" is unique to the Japanese language. One of the classical names of Japan is , a phrase that originated in the Man'y≈çsh≈´.

He is considered an innovator in the field of agricultural machinery on a level with John Deere and Cyrus McCormick. Versatile was the first company to mass-produce articulated four-wheel drive tractors, starting in 1966 with the D100 and G100 four-wheel drives. Those ground-breaking tractors were primitive by modern standards, with a 6-cylinder diesel or 8-cylinder gas engine producing 100 horsepower. 1966 models sold for less than CA$10,000. Four-wheel drive demand increased significantly, with Versatile becoming one of the leaders in four-wheel drive development and production. By the late 1970s the Versatile lineup included tractors ranging from 220 to 330 horsepower. With the 1980s came an expanded line of four-wheel drive tractors that stretched to 470 horsepower in the Versatile 1150.

It was said to have been a prison gang that grew into a more organized entity over time, involved with robbery, kidnapping, arson, and murder-for-hire. Its statutes were said to have been approved in Toledo in 1420 after being founded around 1417.Gratteri & Nicasso, Fratelli di sangue, pp. 22-23. It references F. Caracciolo, Miseria della mafiologia, Bologna: Monduzzi Editore, pp. 38-39. Spanish historians Le√≥n Arsenal and Hip√≥lito S√°nchiz have traced all references to the Gardu√±a back to the 19th-century book Misterios de la inquisici√≥n espa√±ola y otras sociedades secretas de Espa√±a by V√≠ctor de Fereal (maybe a pseudonym for Madame de Suberwick) and Manuel de Cuend√≠as, published in 1850. Arsenal and Sanchiz doubt the Gardu√±a ever existed.Arsenal & Sanchiz, Una historia de las sociedades secretas espa√±olas, pp. 326-335 As a secret society, the Gardu√±a is very attractive for conspiracism, according to the historian S√°nchiz. It was supposedly active for over 400 years in Spain and, among other things, it supposedly carried out the dirty work of the Inquisition. In serious Spanish studies about bandolerismo (outlaws) and social disorders (very frequent in Andalusia in the 19th century), there is not a single mention of the Gardu√±a. Interview with historian Hip√≥lito S√°nchiz , Minuto digital, December 11, 2006 Some have claimed that the Gardu√±a was a precursor to the Neapolitan Camorra, a crime syndicate active to this day in southern Italy, and was transplanted when Spain controlled Naples and much of its criminal element was transported (or deported) there.Behan, The Camorra, p. 9 A Calabrian folk song suggests a much larger legacy. It tells the story of three Gardu√±a \\"brothers\\" or three Spanish knights who fled Spain in the 17th century after washing with blood the honour of their seduced sister. They were shipwrecked on the island of Favignana, near Sicily. Osso, devoted to Saint George, stayed in Sicily and founded the Mafia or Cosa Nostra; Mastrosso, protected by Saint Michael, made his way to Calabria and founded the 'Ndrangheta; and Carcagnosso, a devotee of the Virgin Mary, made his way to Naples and founded the Camorra.Gratteri & Nicasso, Fratelli di sangue, pp. 27-28. Additionally, the circumstances surrounding the original shipwreck seem to suggest their main occupations as pirates, and alludes to a connection with pirates throughout the Spanish Empire, including the Americas.

He was a director of silent films during the 1920s, and in the 1930s he became associated with the style of poetic realism in French cinema. He adopted French nationality in 1928. Career Born Jacques L√©on Louis Fr√©d√©rix in Ixelles, Belgium, he was educated at the √âcole r√©gimentaire in Nivelles, and was destined for a military career. At age twenty-five however he moved to Paris where he pursued an interest in acting, first on stage and then in film, adopting the name Jacques Feyder. He joined the Gaumont Film Company and in 1914 he became an assistant director with Gaston Ravel. He started directing films for Gaumont in 1916, but his career was interrupted by service with the Belgian army during 1917-1919. Henry Roussel and Albert Pr√©jean (right) in Les Nouveaux Messieurs (1929) After the end of the war, he returned to filmmaking and quickly built a reputation as one of the most innovative directors in French cinema. L'Atlantide (1921) (based on the novel by Pierre Benoit), and Crainquebille (1922) (from the novel by Anatole France) were his first major films to achieve public and critical attention. He followed these with Visages d'enfants (filmed in 1923 but not released until 1925) which proved to be one of his most personal and enduring films. Shortly after this, Feyder was offered a post as artistic director of a new film company, Vita Films, in Vienna, along with a contract to make three films. He made Das Bildnis (L'Image) (1923), but the company failed and he returned to Paris.Oxford Companion to Film, ed. by Liz-Anne Bawden (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1976) p.247. He re-established himself with Gribiche (1926) and the literary adaptations of Carmen (1926) and Th√©r√®se Raquin (1928). He also contributed screenplays of films for other directors, notably Poil de carotte (1925) for Julien Duvivier, and Gardiens de phare (1929) for Jean Gr√©millon. His last silent film in France was Les Nouveaux Messieurs, a topical political satire which provoked calls for it to be banned in France for \\"insulting the dignity of parliament and its ministers\\".International Dictionary of Film and Filmmakers: vol.2: Directors, ed. by Tom Prendergast and Sarah Prendergast; 4th ed. (Chicago, London: St James Press, 2000) pp.325-328. By this time Feyder had accepted an offer from MGM to work in Hollywood, where in 1929 his first project was directing Greta Garbo in The Kiss, her last silent film. It was in Hollywood that he made the transition to sound films; even before he had worked with sound films, Feyder declared himself to be a firm believer in their future, in contrast with some of his French contemporaries.Roger Icart, La R√©volution du parlant vue par la presse fran√ßaise, (Toulouse: Institut Jean Vigo, 1988); quoted in The French Cinema Book, ed. by Michael Temple and Michael Witt (London: BFI, 2004), p.172. In 1930, he directed Jetta Goudal in her only French language film made in Hollywood, Le Spectre vert. His subsequent work in the USA consisted mainly of directing foreign-language versions of American films, including a German version of Anna Christie, again with Garbo. Disillusioned with the Hollywood system, Feyder returned to France in 1933. During the next three years he made three of his most successful films, all of them in collaboration with screenwriter Charles Spaak and featuring Fran√ßoise Rosay in a leading role. Le Grand Jeu (1934) and Pension Mimosas (1935) were both significant creations in the style of poetic realism; La Kermesse h√©ro√Øque (1935) (also known as Carnival in Flanders) was a meticulously staged period film which aroused some contemporary political resonances; it earned Feyder several international awards.Jacques Feyder & Fran√ßoise Rosay, Le Cin√©ma, notre m√©tier.

Paris: Association fran√ßaise de recherche sur l'histoire du cin√©ma, 1998. pp. 38-41. (1895, num√©ro hors s√©rie. Octobre 1998). Feyder went on to direct films in England and Germany prior to the outbreak of World War II, but with diminishing success. Following the Nazi occupation in 1940, which led to the banning of La Kermesse h√©ro√Øque, he left France for the safety of Switzerland, and directed a last film there, Une femme dispara√Æt (1942).Ephraim Katz, The International Film Encyclopedia, (London: Macmillan, 1980) p.414. In 1917, Feyder had married Parisian-born actress Fran√ßoise Rosay (1891‚Äì1974) with whom he had three sons; she acted in many of his films and collaborated with him as writer and assistant director on Visages d'enfants. Jacques Feyder died in 1948 at Prangins, Switzerland, and he was buried in the Cimeti√®re de Sorel Moussel, Eure et Loir, France. A school (lyc√©e) in √âpinay-sur-Seine in the north of Paris was named in his honour in 1977; √âpinay was the location of the Tobis film studios where Feyder made Le Grand Jeu and Pension Mimosas. Reputation In 1944 Feyder and Fran√ßoise Rosay published Le Cin√©ma, notre m√©tier, an autobiographical memoir of their work together in the cinema, in which Feyder stated that he regarded himself as an artisan, a craftsman of filmmaking. Some critics have been content to take him at his word and to look no further for any underlying vision of the world. He was however insistent upon his creative independence, demonstrated by his willingness to make his films in so many different countries if the conditions of production appeared favourable. Recurrent themes in his work include the reckless love of a mysterious or unknown woman (L'Atlantide, L'Image, Carmen, Le Grand Jeu), the gap between reality and the vision that someone has of it (Crainquebille, Gribiche, Les Nouveaux Messieurs, La Kermesse h√©ro√Øque), and maternal love (Gribiche, Visages d'enfants, Pension Mimosas).Georges Sadoul, Le Cin√©ma fran√ßais, (Paris: Flammarion, 1962) p.48. His style was characterised by a classical balance and moderation, composition of images that was beautiful without becoming gratuitous, and a sympathetic rapport with actors. Above all his films achieved an atmosphere of realism, whether through the accumulation of judiciously chosen detail, the use of location shooting, or the use of elaborately designed sets; (he worked closely with Lazare Meerson on several of his films).Dictionnaire du cin√©ma populaire fran√ßais des origines √† nos jours, sous la direction de Christian-Marc Boss√©no et Yannick Deh√©e, (Paris: Nouveau Monde √âditions, 2004) p.357. In this respect, his adherence to a realistic tradition in French cinema was contrasted with the 'impressionist' style of some contemporaries in the 1920s such as Abel Gance, Marcel L'Herbier, and Jean Epstein, and it pointed the way to the vogue for poetic realism which found its fullest expression in the films of Marcel Carn√©: Carn√© worked as assistant director to Feyder in the mid-1930s.Jean-Pierre Jeancolas, 15 ans des ann√©es trente: le cin√©ma des fran√ßais 1929-1944, (Paris: Stock, 1983) p.176. Feyder's relatively early death may have contributed to a fading of interest in his films, reinforced by the hostility of some influential critics associated with Cahiers du cin√©ma in the 1950s. His younger contemporary Ren√© Clair judged in 1970, \\"Jacques Feyder does not occupy today the place his work and his example should have earned him\\".Quoted in International Dictionary of Film and Filmmakers: vol.2: Directors, ed. by Tom Prendergast and Sarah Prendergast; 4th ed. (Chicago, London: St James Press, 2000) pp.325-328. Any subsequent reassessment has tended to be hampered by the limited availability of his films in English-speaking countries, with the exception of La Kermesse h√©ro√Øque which some reckon to have aged less well than other examples of his work. These factors have contributed to a sometimes ambivalent attitude to his work as a whole.E.g. David Thomson, New Biographical Dictionary of Film; 4th ed. (London: Little, Brown, 2002) p.286. \\"There was a time when Feyder was claimed as a great realist director, when Kermesse h√©ro√Øque was thought of as an important French film. ...Feyder may be unfairly neglected today just as once he was injudiciously acclaimed.\\" Filmography Bibliography * Feyder, Jacques and Rosay, Fran√ßoise, Le cin√©ma, notre m√©tier, (Gen√®ve: A.

At the time, southern Lebanon was controlled by the Maronite Christian militias and the South Lebanon Army, as the Free Lebanon State (1978-1984) and later the South Lebanon security belt administration. Background From the 1948 establishment of the State of Israel until 1970, Israel's border with Lebanon was quiet to the point that farmers from the Israeli town of Metula farmed their lands in the Ayoun Valley inside Lebanon. In 1970, after their expulsion from Jordan during Black September, the PLO began taking control over southern Lebanon and violating the tranquility that had prevailed in the area . History The beginning of the Good Fence coincides with the beginning of the civil war in Lebanon in 1976 and Israeli support for the predominantly-Maronite militias in southern Lebanon in their battle with the PLO. From 1977, Israel allowed the Maronites and their allies to find employment in Israel and provided assistance in exporting their goods through the Israeli port city of Haifa. The main border crossing through which goods and workers crossed was the Fatima Gate crossing near Metula. This provided essential economic stability to the administration of the Free Lebanon State and the later South Lebanon security belt administration. Israel states that before 2000, approximately one-third of the ophthalmology patients at Western Galilee Hospital were Lebanese who crossed the border through the Good Fence and received treatment free of charge. The Good Fence ceased to exist with Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000 and disintegration of the South Lebanon security belt administration and the SLA militia.

The genus is known from a single specimen found in 1981 by a Soviet-Mongolian expedition in the Bayan Shireh Formation and formally described in the same year by Rinchen Barsbold; the only species is Garudimimus brevipes. Several interpretations about the anatomical traits of Garudimimus were made in posterior examinations of the specimen, but most of them were criticized during its comprehensive redescription in 2005. Extensive undescribed ornithomimosaur remains at the type locality of Garudimimus may represent additional specimens of the genus. The only known specimen of Garudimimus was a medium-sized animal measuring in length and weighing about . It was an ornithomimosaur with a mix of basal and derived features; unlike primitive ornithomimosaurs, both upper and lower jaws were toothless, a trait that is often reported in more derived ornithomimids. Garudimimus had relatively short and stocky hindlimbs, robust feet, and a reduced ilia. The foot had four toes with the first one very reduced, whereas ornithomimids were three-toed with the first toe lost. The toothless skull has very straight jaws ending in a more rounded snout tip than that of other genera. It was previously thought that this primitive ornithomimosaurian possessed a lacrimal \\"horn\\" at the top of the skull, in front of the eye socket. However, the redescription of the only specimen has shown that this structure was simply the distorted left prefrontal bone. Another early interpretation was the metatarsus reconstructed with an arctometatarsalian condition. With the first description in 1981, Garudimimus was identified as a primitive ornithomimosaurian within its own family. However, with the description of new specimens of Deinocheirus in 2014, it was found that the latter was the sister taxon of Garudimimus, grouping within the Deinocheiridae‚Äîornithomimosaurs not adapted for running or agile movements. But this placement has also been found to be unlikely. The pelvic girdle and hindlimbs of Garudimimus show that the musculature of the legs was not as well-developed as in the fast-running ornithomimids, therefore, indicating poor cursorial capacities. Like other members of Ornithomimosauria, Garudimimus was an omnivore/herbivore with a reduced bite force that was compensated by a horny beak. History of discovery Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; Garudimimus fossils have been collected in the Bayshi Tsav locality of area C (Bayan Shireh Formation) In 1981, during a Soviet-Mongolian expedition to the Gobi Desert, a relatively small theropod skeleton was discovered by the team at Bayshi Tsav in the Late Cretaceous Bayan Shireh Formation, Southeastern Mongolia. The remains are catalogued as MPC-D 100/13 (originally GIN 100/13) and represent a rather complete and articulated skeleton. In the same year this specimen was formally and briefly described by the Mongolian paleontologist Rinchen Barsbold as the holotype of the new-named type species Garudimimus brevipes. The generic name, Garudimimus, combines a reference to Garuda which are legendary winged creatures from Mongolian Buddhist mythology and a Latin mimus (meaning mimic). The specific name is derived from Latin brevis (meaning short) and pes (meaning foot), referring to the short metatarsus. Barsbold identified Garudimimus as an ornithomimosaurian taxon but noted it was more primitive than ornithomimids and gave it its own family, the Garudimimidae. Translated paper Barsbold described additional remains of the holotype specimen in 1983, and later in 1990 with Halszka Osm√≥lska. Translated paper An incorrect interpretation was made by Philip J. Currie and Dale Alan Russell who referred the metatarsus of MPC-D 100/13 as Oviraptor sp. and reconstructed it with an arctometatarsal condition. Thomas R. Holtz followed this interpretation and suggested the metatarsus could have been arctometatarsalian and was just disarticulated as preserved. Supporting an arcometatarsalian condition, Currie and David A. Eberth claimed that part of the Archaeornithomimus material belonged to Garudimimus based on the assumed arctometatarsalian condition, presence of the vestigial digit I and the proportions of metatarsals II, III, and IV. They pointed out that the metatarsals are crushed and metatarsal III is set back from the extensor surface of metatarsus. In 1994 Holtz suggested some similarities between the metatarsus of Garudimimus and Chirostenotes. During the same year, Perez-Moreno with colleagues described the primitive ornithomimosaurs Pelecanimimus and identified the presence of a crest in the holotype specimen. They claimed a similar trait in Garudimimus which was represented by a nasal horn. Mounted holotype skull In a comprehensive redescription in 2005, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi and Barsbold observed the holotype as including the skull in its entirety, 8 cervical vertebrae (including the atlas and axis), 9 dorsal vertebrae, 6 sacral vertebrae and 4 caudal vertebrae, some ribs, both ilia, pubes, femora, tibiae, fibulae, and a virtually complete left pes of a sub-adult individual. This redescription refuted numerous of the previous statements, showing the supposed orbital horn is actually the disarticulated left prefrontal bone and verified that the metatarsus did not suffered taphonomical distortion and is non- arctometatarsalian. Moreover, Kobayashi previously showed that in addition to actually lacking an arcometatarsalian condition, the metatarsal ratios are different to Archaeornithomimus. Although Garudimimus is solely known from MPC-D 100/13, additional specimens may potentially be present among a large bonebed composed of at least five individuals in Bayshi Tsav and several undescribed ornithomimosaurs from other localities in the Bayan Shireh Formation. Description Size comparison of the holotype Though the holotype specimen is a sub-adult individual, its length is estimated to have been around weighing approximately . The sub-adult status of the holotype may indicate a gently larger size in adults. Some of the distinguishing traits of this taxon include the jaw articulation positioned more backwards than the postorbital bar, openings on the base of the supraoccipital top projection, paired depressions on the lateral surfaces of the anterior caudal vertebrae neural spines, and a deep groove at the upper end of lateral surface of pedal phalanges III-1 and III-2. Based on feather impressions of several specimens of Ornithomimus, Garudimimus likely developed a shaggy, ratite-like feathering. =Skull= Reconstructed rhamphotheca of Garudimimus (top) compared to the derived Struthiomimus (center) and Ornithomimus (bottom) The holotype skull is relatively well preserved with identifiable cranial elements. Although the left side is more damaged than the right one, the former preserves delicate sclerotic rings. Given that the right side is less damaged, the description was more focused in this side. From a dorsal perspective, the skull is greatly crushed from side to side, measuring wide. When retrodeformed, the skull gets notably expanded with a width of . In the original crushed skull, the infratemporal fenestra has an irregular shape due to the displacement of some elements. The upper curvature of this fenestra is poorly developed. The edges of the premaxilla are edentulous, thin and sharply developed, and on the lower lateral surfaces numerous foramina can be found. This premaxilla borders most of the external narial opening but not the posterior edge. When seen from a lateral view, the bottom border of the premaxilla is straight and the contact with the maxilla lies backwards to the posterior end of the nostrils. The lateral premaxilla-maxilla suture forms a right angle to the bottom border of the upper jaw. The dorsal extension of the maxillary process (bony extension) ends posterior to the anterior border of the antorbital fossa. The palatal shelf of both premaxillae has an incisive foramen and a pair of foramina. The lateral surface of the main body of the maxilla is rough as in other ornithomimosaurs. Both promaxillary and maxillary fenestrae are poorly developed. The upper extension of the maxilla joints with the lacrimal at the center of the antorbital fossa. In lateral view, the bottom border of the maxilla is also straight. As in derived ornithomimids, the bottom surface has numerous foramina. The edentulous condition of both premaxilla and dentary with the addition of numerous foramina in their surfaces indicate that a prominent rhamphotheca (beak) was present in life. The nasal bone is elongated and gives form to the posterior border of the external narial opening. It narrows towards the frontal contact, and its posterior end lies between the posterior ends of the prefrontal and lacrimal. Some foramina are present on the top surface. Left quadrate bone of the holotype featuring the posterior pneumatic foramen The lacrimal bone is semi- T-shaped and the anterior tip is damaged with this extension being spaced by the nasolacrimal canal. The surface that is situated on the lateral side and towards the posterior end of the bottom extension has a posterior opening for the nasolacrimal canal‚Äîalso reported in \\"Gallimimus mongoliensis\\". On the inner surface of the lacrimal, a large triangular-shaped depression can be found. The posterior process of the lacrimal narrows and inserts into a depression on the prefrontal. The prefrontal has an anterior process that unites to the lower surface of the main body of the lacrimal. The open dorsal area of the prefrontal is slightly reduced than that of the lacrimal. The anterior process is divided in two, and the inner branch is much larger than the lateral one. In a posterior perspective, the orbital rim of the prefrontal thickens to the bottom and lacks foramina. As preserved, the orbital is a large cavity with a height of . When retrodeformed, it gets slightly larger being wide. Though the right side is more complete, the left side of the skull preserves at least 11 articulated scleral plates forming the sclerotic ring. The radius of the ring is approximately inside and outside. The breadth of each plate is about . The anterior tip of the jugal is not preserved at all, and the sutures for the lacrimal and maxilla are not well-developed. The jugal lengthens to the end and in lateral view, the jugal is very flat and has a rather short posterior process. The lateral surface has a shallow depression to connect with the anterior process of the quadratojugal, however, it is located before the posterior edge of the orbit. The quadratojugal is a large and triangular-shaped bone‚Äîcontrasting with the L-shaped quadratojugal of most ornithomimosaurs. Although the tip of the dorsal process is damaged, it was apparently longer than the anterior one. On the posterior surface, the quadrate preserves a large depression that is positioned at its mid-height. This depression is oval in shape, measuring long and wide. A pneumatic foramen is also present in the bottom area of the depression. Near the bottom region to the depression, the lateral border of the quadrate has a tract for the paraquadrate foramen. Both mandibular condyles are equal in size and well- separated by a groove. The pterygoid extension is triangular-shaped in lateral view and large, measuring at least long at the level of the pneumatic foramen. In a top view, the frontals are triangular and the anterior flattened region of the frontals is inclined towards an anterior direction. To the posterior end, the frontals form a single dome-like structure. On the inner sides, the parietals are flattened in the posterior portion of the skull roof. The skull roof is more wider than long though. The posterior process is stiffened and developed in this direction. Original (left) and reconstructed (right) holotype skull in (a-b) lateral views, and (c-d) top views The postorbital is a sharply developed bone of well-distributed thickness in lateral view. The suture with the frontal originates from the upper posterior region of the orbit and the postorbital-parietal suture stretches to the supratemporal fenestra. To the lower direction, the bottom process is narrow. The bottom tips of the squamosal are damaged and the tall anterior process is connected in the inner side to the posterior process of the postorbital. Both anterior and lower extensions of the squamosal are elongated in a lateral view. The edentulous lower jaws are very complete and well-preserved. The dentary is the longest mandibular element measuring long and is more thickened to the posterior end. Given that Garudimimus had downturned dentaries, the jaws do not occlude across the entire oral border and this would limit the functionality of the jaws. The presence of a rhamphotheca would likely fill the gap to form an occlusal surface. The upper border of the dentary is well- developed with a cutting edge, and is side to side rounded. Numerous foramina can be found on the lateral surfaces of the dentary tip. The symphysis (bone union) is poorly developed, showing that the interdentary articulation was not robust. Both dentaries form a round shovel-like shelf at the symphysis that is wide and deep. On the inner surface a Meckelian groove can be found, but it is covered by the splenial. The dentary has two posterior processes and one at the anterior border of the external mandibular fenestra. The splenial has its deepest at the posterior end of the cutting edge of the dentary and narrows on the anterior end. Its posterior edge is somewhat concave and inclined forwards from an inner view. The posterior end thins out to the bottom area of the prearticular. A second large mandibular element is represented by the surangular. Its dorsal extension is slightly flattened and extends more to the front than to the anterior edge of the mandibular fenestra. The dorsal edge of the surangular gives form to an inner projection along its entire body. This edge has a ridge-like structure to joint with the mandibular condyle of the quadrate. The surangular lacks any traces of a posterior surangular foramen. It only participates in anterior half of the lateral surface of the retroarticular process. The retroarticular process (a backwards bony extension) points gently upward at its posterior tip. Compared to the surangular, the angular is smaller and borders the external mandibular fenestra towards the bottom. The straight suture between these bones extends from the posterior end of the external mandibular fenestra to the posterior end of the mandible. The anterior process of the angular is elongated and meets the dentary in this direction. The prearticular is large and stocky. The anterior end of this bone lies posterior to the anterior edge of the external mandibular fenestra and cuts towards the rear. The articular surfaces for the mandibular condyles of the quadrate are well separated by a ridge-like structure. The top regions of this ridge are located in the front and towards the center, and situated on the lateral side and toward the end. A large and deep pneumatopore can be found on the inner surface. =Postcranial skeleton= Skeletal diagram showing known elements of the holotype Most cervical vertebrae have eroded surfaces and are side to side crushed; the most complete cervical is represented by the axis. Aside from the atlas and axis, six more vertebrae are preserved and can be attributed to third through sixth cervicals, but the last two are of unknown position. The partial intercentrum of the atlas is articulated near the lower region of the axis and the left half of the neural arch is also present. The central length of the axis is rather short, measuring approximately long and high‚Äîprobably a primitive condition in ornithomimosaurs. Its posterior articular surface is concave and taller than wide. On the lateral surfaces of the centrum, a pneumatic fossa is absent. The neural spine is tall and very rounded having a ligament scar on the posterior border, and the axial neural arch has a pneumatic fossa at the mid-length of its centrum. Cervicals third to fifth are articulated but only preserving the right side of the neural arches and cervicals fourth with sixth are the most complete. The neural spines are narrow and located towards the end. The two last cervicals are articulated and their exact positions are unclear, however, their elongated postzygapophyses suggest that they belong to the posterior series. Nevertheless, the anterior cervical of these two is probably the seventh cervical. Nine consecutive dorsal vertebrae are preserved and based on Ornithomimus, they probably represent fourth through twelfth dorsals. They progressively increase in size and some sutures around the dorsals are not completely fused, suggesting that the holotype specimen is not fully mature. Along with the size, the neural spines become progressively taller in more posterior dorsals, but their lengths are nearly equal. In a lateral view, all spines are slightly inclined towards the end except the twelfth, which is forwards fractured. The dorsal centra are larger in more posterior vertebrae with amphicoelous (strongly concave) facets and the lateral surfaces lack pneumatization. On the bottom surfaces in the fourth and fifth dorsal centra, large ridge-like structures can be found. In the lateral surfaces of the centra, both anterior and posterior edges have ligament scars. Life restoration The sacrum is composed of six sacral vertebrae of which the first and sixth have sacral ribs attached to the inner surface of the ilium. The total length of the sacrum‚Äî‚Äîis nearly equal to that of the ilium. Most sacral centra are roughly equal in length except for the fourth one. There are some fused sections of the sacrum, such as the first and second, and the third and fourth sacrals, but some areas are partially unfused. The neural spines of the first to fifth sacrals are fused and the neural spine of the sixth is missing. This irregular ossification may indicate a sub-adult individual. The sacral vertebrae lack pneumatization and in a lateral view ligament scars can be found on the anterior borders of the first and sixth sacral vertebrae, and posterior edges of the fifth and sixth sacral vertebrae. The first four caudal vertebrae are preserved with all the sutures between the centra and neural arch open. The neural spines become progressively shorter and have straight and horizontal dorsal borders with the anterior and posterior borders grooved. The lengths of the centra are equal and on their bottom surfaces, the caudal vertebrae have paired projections on either side of the sulci (fissures) for the chevron articulation. Putative large foramen on the right side of the neural arch of the anterior caudal vertebrae and deep fossae situated on both the right back and the side surface of an anterior neural arch could indicate caudal pneumaticity in Garudimimus. The third and fourth cervical chevrons are partially preserved only with their posterior and anterior parts, respectively. Nine dorsal ribs are present in the holotype and have a short tuberculum and long capitulum. Fifteen gastralia fragments are preserved but their exact positions are unknown. These are segmented into, at least, lateral and inner parts. Most sacral ribs are poorly developed. The pelvic girdle is nicely preserved, however, both ischia are not present. Both ilia are gently crushed and the dorsal edges of the ilia lie close to each other with the anterior end being hook-shaped. In a lateral view, the ischiadic peduncle (extension behind the acetabulum to attach the ischium) is wedge-shaped and pointed, and wide in from the bottom view as in most other ornithomimosaurs. The brevis fossa (caudofemoralis brevis muscle attachment) is large but very shallow, in addition, the ilium is not as extensive as in ornithomimids. The cuppedicus fossa (concavity between the preacetabular blade and pubic peduncle) is smaller than the brevis fossa. The pubis is a large element measuring in length. In lateral view, the upper end has an elongated hook-like structure on the bottom border of the pubis‚Äìischium contact. Its shaft is nearly straight and the posterior extension of the pubic boot (large projection at the end) is longer than the anterior extension. Both pubes are fused. Non-arctometatarsalian vs arctometatarsalian condition in ornithomimosaurs; Garudimimus in g The femur measures and from a lower view, the total length of the femur head is more than half of the width lying across of the its upper end. On the anterior border of the lesser trochanter, a large additional trochanter can be found and these trochanters are divided by a sulcus. The fourth trochanter is positioned at roughly 1/3 of the femur length from the upper end. The tibial articular protuberance of the lateral condyle is developed on a posterior direction. The tibiotarsus-femur length ratio is 1.1 and its upper end has equally developed lateral and inner posterior condyles. The fibula is slightly shorter than the tibia ( and respectively). This bone is more flattened than other limb elements and the shaft is very thin. Both astragalus and calcaneum are attached in the left tibia, but the calcaneum appears to be slightly damaged. Among the lower tarsal elements preserved are III and IV. The tarsal III articulates to the upper surface of the third metatarsal and partially with the second metatarsal. Tarsal IV covers most of the upper surface of the fourth metatarsal. In the pes formula, Garudimimus strongly differs from the ornithomimid condition by having five metatarsals. Metatarsal I is the first and smallest element of the metatarsus with a more flattened and pinched shape. The articular surface between metatarsal I and metatarsal II is located on the posterior surface of the latter. Metatarsals II and IV are subequal in length and metatarsal III is the longest (). The lower end of metatarsal III is wider in a frontal view and is not pinched at its upper end, therefore indicating a non-arctometatarsalian condition. This trait is partially shared with the large Beishanlong and Deinocheirus. Metatarsal V is a very reduced and thin element that has no functional significance and articulates with the posterior surface of metatarsal IV. Only eight pedal phalanges and two left pedal unguals are present with the holotype. The feet had four primitive toes with the first being the smallest. Most phalanges are very similar in shape being expanded in their anterior and posterior ends with rounded lateral condyles and concave anterior articular surfaces. They become progressively shorter from the second to the fourth digit. Both preserved unguals have a recurved shape, which differs from the straight shape in ornithomimids. The ungual from the fourth digit has a prominent flexor tubercle (flexor tendons attachment). The second digit ungual is similar to the former in having a strong flexor tubercle but has a more irregular shape. Classification Holotype arms of Deinocheirus, which together with their size generated uncertainties about the identity of this taxon In 1981, Barbold assigned Garudimimus to a separate Garudimimidae given the unusual traits in the taxon. However, he identified these as clearly primitive. With the redescription of the holotype in 2005, more diagnostic characters for Garudimimus were provided. Kobayashi and Barsbold noted that this taxon shared traits with primitive and derived ornithomimosaurs such as four-toed feet and toothless jaws. Their phylogenetic analysis recovered Ornithomimidae as the sister taxon of Garudimimus. In 2014, new and fairly complete specimens of the long-enigmatic Deinocheirus were described by Yuong- Nam Lee and colleagues. The remains showed that Deinocheirus was in fact an ornithomimosaur taxon‚Äîbut aberrantly different‚Äîand also allowed to define the older Deinocheiridae as the family including all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with Deinocheirus than with Ornithomimus. Lee and team performed a large phylogenetic analysis for the Deinocheiridae and the three members were found in this grouping: Beishanlong, Garudimimus and Deinocheirus. Their relationships were mainly represented by various anatomical features in the limbs, but the latter two were strongly related as they both have skull and body remains. The resulting cladogram suggested that ornithomimosaurian dinosaurs diverged into two major lineages in the Early Cretaceous: Deinocheiridae and Ornithomimidae. Unlike the fast-running ornithomimids, deinocheirids were not built for running and the anatomical traits of Deinocheirus when compared to other ornithomimosaurs can be explained by the notable large sizes achieved in this taxon. More recently, in 2019 Hartman and colleagues described the new paravian Hesperornithoides performing an extensive phylogenetic analysis for the Coelurosauria. In the case of ornithomimosaurs, the Garudimimidae was recovered as a family containing Garudimimus and close relatives. Garudimimus was recovered in a rather derived position as the sister taxon of Beishanlong. This analysis found close relationship between Deinocheirus and Garudimimus to be unlikely, with the former recovered at the near base of Ornithomimosauria. Left cladogram per Lee and colleagues 2014, right cladogram per Hartman and colleagues 2019: { width=\\"70%\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  align=\\"left\\" width=\\"50%\\"   align=\\"left\\" width=\\"50%\\"  align=\\"right\\" width=\\"50%\\"  } In 2020, Serrano-Bra√±as and team described and named the new deinocheirid genus Paraxenisaurus from the Cerro del Pueblo Formation. This is the first member of the group to be found outside Asia and its discovery could indicate that deinocheirids originated in Laurasia (northern supercontinent during the Mesozoic) or that they dispersed across polar regions in the Northern Hemisphere; a similar interchange is also known to have occurred in other dinosaur groups with Asian affinities during the Campanian-Maastrichtian ages. The team found Harpymimus to be a rather primitive deinocheirid, however, Beishanlong was placed outside the group. Garudimimus and Deinocheirus were recovered again as closely related taxa with the addition of Paraxenisaurus in a polytomy. Paleobiology Sclerotic ring in a specimen of Prosaurolophus, a taxon that was also studied by Schmitz and Motani Limb proportions, pedal unguals morphology and the extension of the ilium of Garudimimus suggest that it was not adapted for speed as in the more cursorial ornithomimids, which are characterized by powerful thighs and straight unguals. In 2011, Lars Schmitz and Ryosuke Motani measured the dimensions of the sclerotic ring and eye socket in fossils specimens of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, as well as some living species. They noted that whereas diurnal (photopic) animals have smaller sclerotic rings, nocturnal (scotopic) animals tend to have more enlarged rings. Cathemeral (mesopic) animals‚Äîwhich are irregularly active throughout the day and night‚Äîare between these two ranges. Schmitz and Motani separated ecological and phylogenetic factors and by examining 164 living species, they noticed that eye measurements are quite accurate when inferring diurnality, cathemerality or nocturnality in tetrapods. The results indicated that Garudimimus was a cathemeral herbivore with other predatory theropods being mainly nocturnal. Large herbivorous dinosaurs were found to have been cathemeral most likely because of the extended amounts of time during foraging and thermoregulation factors. Birds and pterosaurs were mostly diurnal with some nocturnal exceptions. They concluded that the ecological niche was a main driver in the development of diel activity. However, this analysis was criticized in the same year by Hall and colleagues arguing against the methods employed by Schmitz and Motani in that there is a considerable degree of similarities on scleral anatomy between diurnal, cathemeral and nocturnal animals. Moreover, soft tissues like the cornea are essential in figuring out how much light can enter the eye, which is clearly absent in fossil specimens. Schmitz and Motani made a response to this comment affirming their research and methodology properly categorized extinct dinosaur behaviors based on extant species. They cited the exterior border of the scleral ring as a reliable source when reconstructing visual capabilities. In 2019, Graham M. Hughes and John A. Finarelli analyzed the olfactory bulb ratio in modern birds and preserved skulls of several extinct dinosaur species to predict how many genes would have been involved in the olfactory strength of these extinct species. Their analysis found that most ornithomimosaurs had relatively weak senses of smell; Garudimimus had roughly 417 genes encoding its olfactory receptors and an olfactory bulb ratio of 28.8, indicating a poorly developed sense of smell. Given that these values were more pronounced in larger dinosaur species, such as tyrannosaurids, Hughes and Finarelli pointed out that as dinosaurian lineages became larger, the size of the olfactory bulb also increased, which may suggest olfaction as the dominant sensory modality in non-avian dinosaurs. =Feeding habits= Reconstructed jaw musculature of Garudimimus (top), Struthiomimus (center) and Ornithomimus (bottom) Kobayashi and Barsbold stated in 2005 that the absence of dentition on the lower jaw and the recurved shape of the same, indicates that Garudimimus was fairly more similar to ornithomimids when consuming food than to other primitive ornithomimosaurs. Like ornithomimids, the anterior parts of the upper and lower jaws of Garudimimus were both covered by a beak and may have been used for plucking food. In addition, the sharp edges on the middle portions of the jaws helped for cutting food. Moreover, Garudimimus and kin are widely regarded as herbivore or at least omnivore dinosaurs by their peculiar anatomical traits‚Äîincluding the presence of a beak. In 2015, Andrew R. Cuff and Emily J. Rayfield performed CT scans on taphonomically distorted specimen skulls of Garudimimus, Ornithomimus and Struthiomimus in order to be retrodeformed‚Äîa method used to produce the original state of a deformed object. The scans and relatively completeness of the specimens allowed the reconstruction of the adductor (motion-inducing) musculature of the lower jaw, which was then mapped onto the skulls. Additionally, the extent of the rhamphotheca (beak) was reconstructed into small‚Äîbased on a ratite bird, the ostrich‚Äîand large morphs. Among the three genera studied, Garudimimus had the most reduced bite force, found to produce 19 N at the tip of the beak and 23.9 N at the mid-length of the same. However, this taxon had the most modified muscle mechanical advantage and moment arm‚Äîa measure of the effectiveness of a muscle at contributing to a particular motion over a range of configurations. With this consideration, the most significant muscular difference between Garudimimus and the two ornithomimids was found in that most muscles are more mechanically advantageous in the latter two; this is likely caused due to the longer skull in Garudimimus. Cuff and Rayfield pointed out that the bite force of Garudimimus may be limited for having to use the mandible of Struthiomimus in the reconstructions or that MPC-D 100/13 is a sub-adult individual. Tentatively, they agreed in that relatively low bite forces combined with a rhamphotheca could be used to hold plant material during feeding in ornithomimosaurs, all of this whilst neck musculature provided enough force to pluck away vegetation. In 2019, David J. Button and Lindsay E. Zanno performed a large phylogenetic analysis based on skull biomechanical characters‚Äîprovided by 160 Mezosoic dinosaur species‚Äîto analyze the multiple emergences of herbivory among non-avian dinosaurs. Their results found that herbivorous dinosaurs mainly followed two distinct modes of feeding, either processing food in the gut‚Äîcharacterized by relatively gracile skulls and low bite forces‚Äîor the mouth, which was characterized by features associated with extensive processing such as high bite forces and robust jaw musculature. Garudimimus and Deinocheirus, along with caenagnathid, diplodocoid, ornithomimid, therizinosaurid and titanosaur dinosaurs, were found to be in the former category, indicating that Garudimimus had indeed low bite forces and relied mostly on its stomach to process food. Large body sizes were achieved independently in deinocheirids and ornithomimids, and larger sizes offer advantages to herbivore animals, such as an increased resistance to fasting and more ingestion. Hence, these habits may indicate a more herbivorous life-style in deinocheirids and ornithomimids. However, Button and Zanno pointed out the relationship between herbivory and size is not always related and there is not a lineal trend of increasing mass in ornithomimosaurs. Furthermore, specific niches were poorly exploited for most ornithomimosaurian dinosaurs with only Deinocheirus showing an opportunistic omnivory. Button and Zanno concluded that feeding strategies convergently evolved in unrelated herbivorous dinosaurs over the time. During the same year, Ali Nabavizadeh studied the jaw musculature in herbivorous dinosaurs and concluded that some were primarily orthal feeders‚Äîmoving their jaws up and down‚Äîincluding theropods, sauropodomorphs, primitive ornithischians, and some stegosaurs. Nabavizadeh noted that ornithomimosaurs were orthal feeders and raised their jaws isognathously whereby the upper and lower teeth of each side occluded (contacted each other) at once. Deinocheirus and Garudimimus have unique attachment sites for the muscles that open and close the jaws, which are composed by a downwards-expanded, triangular adductor musculature complex attaching to a forwards expanding surangular bone. This, working together with a flared jugal flange, allows more cavity for the adductor muscle. With such elongate snout, the bite forces of both deinocheirids were low with reduced mechanical advantage, however, if this muscle extended farther forwards then this would have added strength to the temporal muscle. Paleoenvironment Garudimimus compared to the named dinosaurian fauna of the Bayan Shireh Formation (Garudimimus in light yellow, third from the right) The known remains of Garudimimus were unearthed from the Late Cretaceous Bayan Shireh Formation at the Bayshi Tsav locality. This formation is mainly composed by claystones and sandstones with concretions and characterized by mudstones and yellowish-brown medium grained sandstones. The presence of caliche, fluvial and lacustrine sedimentation at various localities indicates that this formation was deposited by meandering rivers and other large water bodies on an alluvial plain (flat land consisting of sediments deposited by highland rivers) under a semi-arid climate. Bayshi Tsav itself, is interpreted to have been deposited under fluvial environments. Using calcite U‚ÄìPb measurements, the age of the Bayan Shireh Formation has been dated from about 95.9 ¬± 6.0 million to 89.6 ¬± 4.0 million years ago during the Cenomanian-Santonian stages. Numerous scale-like cross-stratifications at the Baynshire locality are indicators of large meanders, and the vast majority of these water bodies may have drained the eastern part of the Gobi Desert. These humid environments are further supported by the discovery of aquatic reptiles like turtles and crocodylomorphs, and ostracods. Based on the similar fossil assemblages, a correlation between the Bayan Shireh and Iren Dabasu formations has been proposed by numerous authors. Furthermore, the Iren Dabasu Formation has been dated about 95.8 ¬± 6.2 million years ago. contemporary of Garudimimus Garudimimus shared its habitat with multiple dinosaurian fauna, such as the herbivorous ornithischians Gobihadros, Graciliceratops and Talarurus. Other theropods are represented by the predator of medium-sized prey Achillobator, and the therizinosaurids Erlikosaurus and Segnosaurus. Erketu may have been the tallest herbivore within the fauna. Several species were separated by niche differentiation, such as Erlikosaurus and the large Segnosaurus, or the grazer Talarurus and browser Tsagantegia, another ankylosaurid from the formation. In terms of biodiversity, therizinosaurs were some of the most abundant theropods with multiple described and undescribed specimens across the formation. However, the high concentration of scattered hadrosauroid remains‚Äîparticularly at Baynshire‚Äîappear to reflect a great abundancy; Gobihadros is known from at least three different localities. Though Garudimimus is currently the only ornithomimosaur taxon named, the Bayan Shireh Formation has produced locally abundant ornithomimosaurs at Bayshi Tsav. Among them, the informal \\"Gallimimus mongoliensis\\" is one of the most complete, however, this species does not belong to the much younger Gallimimus and represents an entire new taxon.

Literary critics see books in this series as important members of the Western canon, though many titles are translated or of non- Western origin; indeed, the series for decades from its creation included only translations, until it eventually incorporated the Penguin English Library imprint in 1986. The first Penguin Classic was E. V. Rieu's translation of The Odyssey, published in 1946, and Rieu went on to become general editor of the series. Rieu sought out literary novelists such as Robert Graves and Dorothy Sayers as translators, believing they would avoid \\"the archaic flavour and the foreign idiom that renders many existing translations repellent to modern taste\\". Celebrating their 80th anniversary in 2015, Penguin released 80 Little Black Classics In 1964 Betty Radice and Robert Baldick succeeded Rieu as joint editors, with Radice becoming sole editor in 1974 and serving as an editor for 21 years.Radice, William; Reynolds, Barbara (1987).

Hall (eds) Women Classical Scholars: Unsealing the Fountain from the Renaissance to Jacqueline de Romilly, Oxford. p.347-349 As editor, Radice argued for the place of scholarship in popular editions, and modified the earlier Penguin convention of the plain text, adding line references, bibliographies, maps, explanatory notes and indexes.Fowler, R (2016) 'Betty Radice and the survival of classics' in Wyles, R. and E. Hall (eds) Women Classical Scholars: Unsealing the Fountain from the Renaissance to Jacqueline de Romilly, Oxford. p.347-349,358 She broadened the canon of the 'Classics', and encouraged and diversified their readership while upholding academic standards. Design Penguin Books paid particular attention to the design of its books recruiting German typographer Jan Tschichold in 1947. The early minimalist designs were modernised by Italian art director Germano Facetti, who joined Penguin in 1961. The new classics were known as \\"Black Classics\\" for their black covers, which also featured artwork appropriate to the topic and period of the work. This design was revised in 1985 to have pale yellow covers with a black spine, colour-coded with a small mark to indicate language and period (red for English, purple for ancient Latin and Greek, yellow for medieval and continental European languages, and green for other languages). In 2002, Penguin redesigned its entire catalogue. The redesign restored the black cover, adding a white stripe and orange lettering. The text page design was also overhauled to follow a more closely prescribed template, allowing for faster copyediting and typesetting, but reducing the options for individual design variations suggested by a text's structure or historical context (for example, in the choice of text typeface). Prior to 2002, the text page typography of each book in the Classics series had been overseen by a team of in-house designers; this department was drastically reduced in 2003 as part of the production cost reductions. The in-house text design department still exists, albeit much smaller than formerly. Recent design work includes the Penguin Little Black Classic series. =Bill Amberg= Penguin Classics collaborated with Bill Amberg in 2008 in the design of six books (A Room with a View, Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Big Sleep, The Great Gatsby, Brideshead Revisited, and The Picture of Dorian Gray). Series Within the broader category of Classics, Penguin has issued specialised series with their own designs. These include: * Penguin Nature Classics, issued, with authors such as John James Audubon, Rachel Carson, and John Muir * Penguin Modern Classics, issued from 1961 onwards, with authors such as Truman Capote, James Joyce, George Orwell, Vladimir Nabokov, and Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry. Some titles come with critical apparatus. The series has gone through a number of redesigns, the most recent being in June 2017: see here here, and here. The series was renamed Penguin 20th Century Classics in May 1989, but the series reverted to its old name in February 2000. 20th Century Classics feature full- page front cover art, with a light blue-green/eau de nil rear cover and spine. * Penguin Enriched Classics, issued, such as Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Pride and Prejudice, The Scarlet Letter, and A Tale of Two Cities * Penguin Popular Classics, issued in 1994, are paperback editions of texts under the Classics imprints. They were a response to Wordsworth Classics, a series of very cheap reprints which imitated Penguin in using black as its signature colour. * Penguin Designer Classics, issued in 2007, is a set of five limited- edition books, with covers created by fashion designers to commemorate the series' 60th Anniversary * Penguin Mini Modern Classics, issued in 2011, is an assortment of fifty pocket-sized books from fifty different authors such as Franz Kafka, Italo Calvino, E. M. Forster, Virginia Woolf and Stefan Zweig. It has been released to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Penguin Modern Classics. It is currently out of print. * Penguin Little Black Classics, issued in 2015 a series of pocket-sized classics introduced to celebrate the 80th anniversary of Penguin Books. * Pocket Penguins, issued in 2016. The series echoes the style of the original Penguin Books, with smaller A-format size, and tri-band design. The first 20 books were released in May 2016, and described by publishing director Simon Winder as \\"a mix of the famous and the unjustly overlooked\\". Bibliography No definitive bibliography of Penguin Classics has yet been published, although several partial bibliographies have been issued. The earliest come from the Penguin Catalogues, published annually covering in-print editions. The 1963 catalogue, for example, lists 97 titles, although by then the series overall had produced 118 volumes. In the 1980s Penguin (UK) began publishing discrete catalogues of its Classics and Twentieth Century Classics series, listing all the titles then available in the UK (with prices in sterling). The Penguin Collectors' Society have published two bibliographies of the early, pre-ISBN (referred to as 'L') editions: firstly in 1994, with an update in 2008. Also in 2008, Penguin Books USA published a complete annotated listing of all Penguin Classics titles in a single paperback volume in the style of its Penguin Classics books. The list organises the collection multiple times: alphabetically by author, subject categories, authors by region, and a complete alphabetic title index. This compiled listing indicates there are over 1,300 titles, and more to be published. The final print version of this listing was issued in 2012, however a copy of the 2016 listing remains available on the Penguin website. In 2018 Penguin published The Penguin Classics Book, a celebratory survey of the volumes currently in print, listing works by author location and chronologically from antiquity to World War One. It includes an appendix with a selection of out-of-print titles. =Complete Collection= In 2005, an incomplete collection of books in the series was sold on Amazon.com as \\"The Penguin Classics Library Complete Collection\\". In 2005, the collection consisted of 1,082 different books (in multiple editions) and cost US$7,989.50. The collection weighed about 750 pounds (340 kg) and took about 77 linear feet (23.5 m) of shelf space; laid end-to-end the books would reach about 630 feet (192 m). A feature of the World's Biggest Bookstore in Toronto, Canada, from its inception in the 1970s, and for years thereafter, was that it stocked all of the Penguin Classics titles. The upper section of the second floor of the store was dedicated to Penguin exclusively. 60th Anniversary In 2007, Penguin Classics released a set of five books limited to 1,000 copies each, known as the Designer Classics. Each book was specially designed to celebrate Penguin Classics' Diamond Anniversary: *The cover for Crime and Punishment was created by graphic designers Stephen Sorrell and Damon Murray of Fuel, who used Cyrillic and English type. Stephen explains: \\"This visual device echoes the mind games in the head of Raskolnikov as he battles with his voice of conscience. We want the design to form the shape and feel of the book as a whole not just its cover.\\" They have screen printed the cover on the same brown craft paper used for the text. The book has a Perspex slipcase. *The Idiot was designed by industrial designer Ron Arad and has no cover, so the reader will pick it up and read the author's first words. It is stripped back to show the glue and thread in the spine, which is visible through an acrylic slipcase (with a lid) with a fresnel lens, so the text appears to move as the lid is removed. Arad explains: \\"By not wanting to have a cover, it ended with the book becoming an amazing object that is alive, but which maintains its transparency. It became a glorious box with a book inside‚Äîalmost like a monument.\\" *The cover for Lady Chatterley's Lover was created by fashion designer Paul Smith. *The cover for Madame Bovary was designed by fashion designer Manolo Blahnik. The jacket features Blahnik's original painting of Emma with her lover, and the book is protected by a Perspex slipcase. He said: \\"I wanted to come up with something light, sensual... something frivolous, because this is a novel about the dangers of frivolity. And I wanted something sexy too, cheeky. I usually focus on one part of the foot‚Äîthe shoe. For this project, I had to consider a whole scene, there had to be a context, which is new for me. But I managed to sneak in a pair of shoes anyway. She wore good shoes.\\" *The cover for Tender Is the Night was designed by English filmmaker, photographer, and visual artist Sam Taylor-Wood, who used an ethereal black- and-white photograph printed onto tracing paper. An elegant, barefoot young man stands with his hands in his pocket, perfectly summing up the elegance and fragility of Nicole and Dick Diver's world. The book is wrapped in a cloth hardcover and has a Perspex slipcase. Morrissey controversy In 2013, Penguin Classics published Morrissey's Autobiography. Concerns arose about the imprint's publishing a book too recently published to be an acknowledged classic, that such a book diluted the brand. Penguin argued that the autobiography was \\"a classic in the making\\". The Independents Boyd Tonkin wrote: \\"The droning narcissism of the [book] may harm [Morrissey's] name a little. It ruins that of his publisher... Morrissey will survive his unearned elevation. I doubt that the reputation of Penguin Classics will.\\"  Pandemic reading  Penguin Classics sold well during the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic when citizens in many countries, forced into lockdown as a preventive measure, found solace in books.

In 1842, he created the title-role in Giuseppe Verdi's Nabucco at La Scala, Milan. Personal life Ronconi was born in Milan and had been taught to sing by his father, Domenico Ronconi, who was a leading tenor. He married soprano Elguerra Giannoni on 8 October 1837 in Naples, Italy. By some accounts Giannoni had sung with some success at the Lyceum Theatre and at the King's Theatre in London.Maitland 1908, p. 134 However, Harold Rosenthal has written: \\"This lady, who failed on virtually every opera stage in Europe, was considered a good concert-room singer only, but so indispensable was her husband to any Italian company that willy-nilly she had to be engaged as well.\\"Rosenthal 1958, p. 75 In his later years, Ronconi founded a school of singing at Granada in Spain and also accepted a professorial post at the Madrid Royal Conservatory. Ronconi died in Madrid, aged 79. Career in opera He made his operatic debut at Pavia in 1831, as Valdeburgo in Bellini's La straniera, and went on to sing at the Teatro alla Scala and elsewhere in Italy. In the 1830s and 1840s, he appeared in the first performances of seven operas by Donizetti: * 1833, as Cardenio in Il furioso all'isola di San Domingo; * 1833, in the title role in Torquato Tasso; * 1836, as Enrico in Il campanello; * 1837, as Nello Dello Pietra in Pia de' Tolomei; * 1838, as Corrado Waldorf in Maria de Rudenz; * 1841, as Don Pedro in Maria Padilla; and * 1843, as Enrico, Duke of Chevreuse, in Maria di Rohan. In 1842, Ronconi appeared for the first time in London, at Her Majesty's Theatre, performing the part of Henry Ashton in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor. Ronconi's success with audiences outside Italy was immediate, and he continued to be one of the most popular and influential operatic artists in Europe until the early 1870s, when he retired. For instance, from 1847 and until 1866, he appeared at London's Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, in the second and third of the three theatres on that site (now known as the Royal Opera House.) Vienna heard him in 1843 and he sang in St Petersburg between 1850 and 1860 and New York City from 1866 to 1872. Assessment and legacy The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica offers the following assessment of Ronconi: > His voice was neither extensive in compass nor fine in quality, but the > genius of his acting and the strength of his personality atoned for his > vocal defects. He was equally at home in comedy and tragedy, and the two > parts by which he is best remembered, Rigoletto and Figaro, show > conclusively the range of his talent. The two roles cited are the title character in Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto and the central character of Gioachino Rossini's The Barber of Seville. A large section is devoted to descriptions of Ronconi's powers in the critic Henry Fothergill Chorley's Recollections of 1862.Chorley 1862, pp. 14‚Äî21 Another celebrated 19th century baritone, Sir Charles Santley, recorded in his 1892 memoirs the following anecdote about Ronconi: :The word libert√† (\\"freedom\\") was expunged from the Italian stage-vocabulary by the [occupying] Austrians. Singing in the duet \\"Suoni la tromba\\" in I Puritani on one occasion, Ronconi gave the words gridando libert√† (\\"crying Liberty!\\") with such vigour and emphasis that the audience was excited to the pitch of frenzy, and a great commotion ensued. Next morning he received a reprimand for using the prohibited word, accompanied by a request to use the word lealt√† (\\"loyalty\\") on future occasions in its stead. Shortly after, playing Il Sergente in L'elisir d'amore and in deference to the request for him to substitute perd√® la liberta (\\"lost his freedom\\") with perd√® la lealt√† (\\"lost his loyalty\\"), the result was received with shrieks of laughter by the audience, to the great discomfiture of the advocates of \\"loyalty\\".Santley 1892, p. 80 Ronconi instigated a long line of great Italian baritones that continued into modern times. But the most esteemed of his contemporaries and immediate successors were probably Felice Varesi, Leone Giraldoni, Francesco Graziani and Antonio Cotogni, all of whom were chosen by Verdi himself to create or premiere his baritone roles.

The game is a sequel to the Master System/Game Gear title Sonic the Hedgehog, and follows the titular character Sonic as he attempts to rescue his friend Tails and all of the island's animals from the villainous Doctor Robotnik. The gameplay is based on traversing a number of levels while collecting gold rings and attacking enemies. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was met with critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the visuals and gameplay while criticizing the high difficulty. In 1993, a sequel, Sonic Chaos, was released. As the game was released before the Sega Genesis version, it represents the debut of character Tails, who would become a mainstay in the series. Whilst the Master System version of the game was not initially released outside Europe and Brazil, it later become available worldwide following its release on the Wii's Virtual Console in 2008. Gameplay Sky High Zone Act 1, the second zone in the game (Game Gear version) Like the previous games, players control Sonic the Hedgehog as he makes his way through each of the game's seven zones, fighting against various badniks and overcoming deadly obstacles. By collecting rings, Sonic can protect himself from damage against enemies and obstacles (with the exception of pitfalls and drowning), with extra lives earned for collecting 100 rings. Unlike the previous 8-bit title, Sonic is now able to recollect some of his rings for a limited time after being hit. Other technical improvements allow Sonic to smash through certain walls and run through loops. Also added to this iteration are gameplay mechanics unique to certain zones, such as riding a mine cart, using a hang glider to glide across the air, skimming across the surface of water and floating inside giant bubbles to reach higher areas. Unlike the previous game, the game no longer features the Shield and Restart Marker items, so if Sonic loses a life, he must restart at the very beginning of the act. Each of the game's seven zones consist of three acts, the third of which consists of a boss battle (most of which now consist of animal-based robots as opposed to direct confrontations with Dr. Robotnik) in which the player is not given any rings to collect. At the end of each of the first two acts, players can potentially earn bonuses such as additional rings, lives and continues by fulfilling certain criteria upon hitting the act's goal post, such as having a specific amount of rings. In the first five zones, a Chaos Emerald is hidden somewhere within the second act. These five emeralds, along with a sixth earned from defeating the sixth zone's boss, are required to access the game's seventh zone and ultimately achieve the game's good ending by defeating the game's final boss. Otherwise, the game will end after the sixth zone, with Sonic unable to rescue Tails. Plot South Island has been peaceful since Dr. Robotnik's defeat. Sonic, bored, decides to go on a journey in search of other adventures. Upon his return, he is shocked to find the island nearly abandoned. The only clue as to where all his friends might have disappeared to was Tails being chased by Dr. Robotnik. Sonic chases after him, but he is too late to save Tails. Sonic finds out that he's been kidnapped by Dr. Robotnik and is being held in a place called Crystal Egg. The price for Tails' safe return are the 6 Chaos Emeralds, to be delivered to 6 new boss robots. Thus, Sonic goes on a quest to find the Chaos Emeralds and rescue Tails. Development and release Sonic the Hedgehog 2 received preview coverage in the October 1992 issue of GamePro. The Game Gear's lower screen resolution results in the Game Gear version having a smaller visible screen area than the Master System edition, causing some fans to consider the Game Gear version the more challenging title. For example, when facing the boss of the Under Ground Zone, the reduced screen area either side of Sonic gives the player less time to react to hazards moving onto the screen. Other bosses were also affected: the Green Hills Zone battle takes place in a smaller, steeper arena; there is a 3rd chute which cannot be seen while fighting Robotnik in the final Crystal Egg stage. The music for the intro sequence is also different. The Game Gear version uses the Scrambled Egg Zone music for the scene showing Robotnik escaping with the captive Tails and the Master System intro music for the title. The boss music is also different between the two versions. The Master System version used a single theme for the endings while a new good ending theme was added for the Game Gear version. The Game Gear version also features dark blue (instead of green) water in the second Act of the Aqua Lake Zone, and omits the game's only \\"Speed Shoes\\" item box, which may be found only in the Master System version of this stage; instead, in the Game Gear version there is a Ring item box in said power-up's original location, thus rendering the item unused in said port. The game's music was written by Naofumi Hataya and Masafumi Ogata, with Tomonori Sawada, in his first game project, contributing the theme for Crystal Egg Zone. Hataya and Ogata would later collaborate to compose the original soundtrack for Sonic the Hedgehog CD, with Ogata's theme for Green Hills Zone being used as the basis for Sonic CD's opening theme song \\"Sonic - You Can Do Anything\\". The Game Gear version was included as an unlockable bonus in Sonic Adventure DX, released in 2003 for Nintendo GameCube and Windows, and as one of the games featured in the Sonic Gems Collection, released for GameCube and PlayStation 2 in 2005. The game was later re-released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service, with the Master System version released for the Wii Virtual Console in December 2008 and the Game Gear version released for the Nintendo 3DS eShop in June 2013. Reception Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Master System and Game Gear has been critically acclaimed since release. The Master System version received a positive review from Mean Machines, which described it as better than its predecessor and as \\"one of the greatest Master System games of all time,\\" giving it an overall 95% score. Mega Zone gave this version an overall 93% score, with reviewer Steward Clark stating that it is \\"radically different to the Mega Drive version\\" but still \\"another winner!\\" He praised the \\"superb gameplay\\" and described it as a \\"classic in its own right.\\" Sega Force gave the Master System version a 92% score, noting that instead of \\"trying to scale down the MD version,\\" Sega have \\"opted for a totally different game -- and well good it is, too!\\" The Game Gear version received a positive review from GamePro staff writer The Unknown Gamer, focusing praise on both the gameplay and the impressive graphics for the small handheld console. It gave the game scores of 5 for graphics, 4 for sound, 4.5 for control, and 5 for overall fun factor. Sega Force gave the Game Gear version a 93% score, describing it as the \\"most challenging\\" and \\"toughest version of Sonic 2.\\" French magazine Mega Force also gave the game a positive review. In 1993, it was awarded as the Best Portable Game of 1992 by Electronic Gaming Monthly. Reviewing the Master System version for its Virtual Console release, IGN gave the game a score of 8.0 out of 10. The reviewer Lucas M. Thomas stated that many Wii owners may \\"erroneously assume that it's a technically inferior port of the Genesis classic with the same name. It's not.\\" He described the Master System game as \\"entirely its own adventure\\" with its own \\"unique elements like mine carts and hang gliders,\\" concluding that it is \\"a hidden gem from Sonic's early years.\\" Notes References External links * Category:1992 video games Category:Aspect Co. games Category:Sega Game Gear games Category:Sega video games Category:Master System games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games Category:Video game prequels Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (8-bit video game)"},{"id":"2599347","text":"Thambiah \\"Terry\\" Pathmanathan (born 9 February 1956) is a former Singapore international footballer who played as a defender.

She made a local success in Manchester, where she was brought up, and in 1923 made a successful London debut. Her career, encouraged by the conductor Sir Hamilton Harty, quickly developed, with breaks in the first years for vocal study in Milan. Baillie's career was almost wholly as a concert singer: she only once acted in an opera production on stage. She was associated above all with oratorio, becoming well known for her many performances in Handel's Messiah, Haydn's The Creation, Mendelssohn's Elijah and the choral works of Elgar. During a long career, Baillie sang in complete recordings of Messiah, Elijah, Beethoven's Missa solemnis and Ninth Symphony. In the 1940s she formed a friendship with the contralto Kathleen Ferrier, with whom she appeared frequently in concert and made several recordings of duets. She took part in 19 annual Three Choirs Festivals from 1929. She made her American debut in 1933 and between then and her retirement from the concert platform in the mid 1950s she sang in the US, New Zealand, the Far East and Africa as well as in Europe. In her later years, Baillie became a teacher at the Royal College of Music, Cornell University and the Royal Manchester School of Music. Life and career =Early years= Baillie was born in Hawick, Roxburghshire on 9 March 1895, the youngest child and third daughter of Martin Pott Baillie (1860‚Äì1904), a baker, and his wife, Isabella Hetherington n√©e Douglas (1865‚Äì1936).Kennedy, Michael. \\"Baillie, Dame Isobel (real name Isabella Douglas Baillie) (1895‚Äì1983), singer\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 12 September 2020. She was christened Isabella Douglas but was known to family and friends as Bella. While she was a young girl the family moved to Newcastle upon Tyne and then to Manchester. She attended a board school, where her singing was encouraged, and then won a scholarship to Manchester High School, where music was not a high priority.Baillie, p. 16 At fifteen, Baillie left school, working first in a music shop and then in Manchester Town Hall.Baillie, p. 17 She took singing lessons from Jean Sadler-Fogg, a former pupil of Blanche Marchesi.Baillie, p. 18 In her spare time she sang at local concerts, at one of which in about 1913 she met Henry (Harry) Leonard Wrigley (1891‚Äì1957), a cotton trader. They married on 31 December 1917 while he was on sick leave from the armed forces in France. Their only child, a daughter, Nancy, was born in December 1918. By this time Baillie was earning more from concert fees than from her work at the town hall and she became a full-time professional. In 1921 Hamilton Harty, conductor of the Hall√© Orchestra, engaged her for several concerts, including performances of Haydn's The Creation and Handel's Messiah. =Leading soloist, 1923‚Äì1940= Baillie made her London debut in 1923.\\"Dame Isobel Baillie\\", The Times, 26 September 1983, p. 12 Sir Henry Wood engaged her for six concerts at the Queen's Hall.

She made her American debut in 1933 at the Hollywood Bowl with Harty conducting; among the numbers she sang were \\"With verdure clad\\" from The Creation, an aria from Carmen and \\"Dove sono\\" from The Marriage of Figaro. The Los Angeles Times said of the last, \\"For style and sheer loveliness of sound [it] was the finest thing that has been heard in the Bowl for a long, long time\\".\\"Program at Bowl rates 'excellent'\\", The Los Angeles Times, 29 June 1933, p. 17 In Britain, Baillie sang for the leading conductors of the 1930s, including Sir Thomas Beecham, Sir Adrian Boult and Malcolm Sargent, and visitors from overseas, including Arturo Toscanini, Bruno Walter and Victor de Sabata.\\"Leeds Music Festival\\", The Times, 6 October 1937, p. 12 (Beecham); \\"Music this week\\", The Times, 6 May 1935, p. 10 (Boult); \\"Courtauld-Sargent Concert\\", The Times, 10 March 1936, p. 14 (Sargent); and \\"The B.B.C. Symphony Concerts\\", The Times, 14 September 1937, p. 10 (Toscanini) Among the concert highlights of Baillie's career in the 1930s was the premiere of Vaughan Williams's Serenade to Music for 16 vocal soloists and orchestra, composed in 1938 to mark the fiftieth anniversary of Wood's first concert. The soloists were eminent singers from Britain and the Commonwealth; the opening and closing lines were sung by Baillie.Palmer, Christopher (1990). Notes to Hyperion CD CDA 30025 Ten days after the concert Wood and his 16 singers recorded the work for Columbia, \\"thereby\\", in the words of Michael Kennedy, \\"preserving her marvellous ascent to top A on the words 'sweet harmony'\\". The recording has been reissued in digital form.WorldCat Baillie had been a pioneer broadcaster, singing on a local Manchester radio station in 1920, before the foundation of the BBC, and in 1938 she took part in an early television broadcast of opera, singing with the tenor Walter Widdop and baritone George Baker in a BBC transmission of Act 2 of Tristan und Isolde.\\"Television\\", Radio Times, 21 January 1938, p. 16 She frequently sang excerpts from Wagner and other operas in concert and studio performance,\\"Wagner, Isobel Baillie\\", BBC Genome.

She embarked on a new career as a teacher at the Royal College of Music in London, from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1961 to 1964, in between which she was visiting professor of singing at Cornell University.Baillie, pp. 141 and 143‚Äì144 In addition she taught for many years at the Royal Manchester School of Music. In 1982 she published her autobiography, Never Sing Louder than Lovely, described by Kennedy as \\"valuable for its details about the singing of Messiah and for vivid pen- portraits of her colleagues\\". Baillie's husband, Harry, died in 1957, after which she moved from their house in Hampshire to St John's Wood, London.

The first sequel to Puzzle Bobble, it was titled in Europe and North America as Bust-A-Move Again on the arcade and Bust-A-Move 2 Arcade Edition on the home consoles. Released into the arcades in 1995, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64 and Windows conversions followed. The game was included in Taito Legends 2, but the US arcade version was included on the US PS2 version instead. The game builds on the original by adding a tournament style variation on the two player game for play against the computer and by adding a branching map to the one player game, allowing the player to periodically select one of two groups of five levels to play next, leading to different game endings. Some of the contestants in the new tournament mode are based on characters from Bubble Bobble, including variations on a Monsta and a Mighta. Some versions of the game, including the PlayStation, feature time trial competitions in which a single player attempts to finish simple rounds quickly enough to beat previous time records or two players simultaneously attempt to beat the records and each other. Completion of the single player game gives the player a code which can be entered to unlock 'Another World' for the single player game, which features subtle changes to the existing levels to increase their difficulty and changes to all backdrops to resemble levels from Bubble Bobble. The various enemies from Bubble Bobble also make an appearance in the background of the credits sequence. North American version Arcade version screenshot. The North American version of the original arcade release is much different than the other versions. One of the most major changes in this version is that Bub and Bob were removed from the game and replaced with a pair of disembodied hands. Also, the characters that were in the Vs. CPU mode were removed and replaced with a generic computer. The backgrounds from the original version were also removed and replaced with 15 new backgrounds, but this also means that the backgrounds get looped in the Puzzle mode, which is 30 stages long. The audio was also changed, and the voices in the game were removed, even though they were in English anyway. These changes were only made for the Taito F3 System version, since the Neo Geo and console releases are based on the original Japanese version. If this version was played in an emulator, it would have the Japanese audio, although the music would cut out in some levels. This emulation error was fixed in 2006 - although not before it appeared in Taito Legends 2. Bust-A-Move 2X Taito later repacked Bust-A-Move 2 with an optional alternative set of levels and some new attract mode animations (including holiday-themed ones) as Bust-A-Move 2X (also known as Puzzle Bobble 2X). Ports of Bust-A-Move 2 to MS-DOS and Sega Saturn are of Bust-A-Move 2X and additionally include a level editor/designer. A port of 2X was made to the PlayStation but was not released until some time after a port of Bust-A-Move 2 was released, and didn't see an international release. North American cover art In North America, print advertisements for the Saturn and PlayStation editions featured a picture of several large blue balls with human faces trapped inside, moaning in apparent agony, with white sticks forcing their eyes open. The shots of the game packaging in the lower right corner of the ad show that the North American release of the game was to use the same cover art as the PAL release. Instead, possibly due to a mix-up by Acclaim's marketing department, the North American release of both Saturn and PlayStation editions uses the main art from the advertisement as their cover art. This cover earned a place on GameSpy's Top Ten Worst Covers list, with journalist Kevin Bowen pointing out that the disturbing imagery was likely to frighten away the game's young target audience. The later MS-DOS and Nintendo 64 releases from Acclaim would use the proper cover art used on the PAL releases. Reception =Critical reception= In Japan, Game Machine listed Puzzle Bobble 2 on their October 15, 1995 issue as being the fourth most-successful arcade game of the year. Game Machine also listed Puzzle Bobble 2X on their February 1, 1996 issue as being the ninth most-successful arcade game of the year. A Next Generation critic gave the game a rave review, calling it \\"One of the most addictive puzzle games in the arcades right now\\". He praised the challenging gameplay and the \\"fascinating\\" trick of bouncing bubbles off the walls to ricochet into the right spot, and concluded, \\"It's fast, fun, and because of the title's bright, innocent looks and unpretentious simplicity, it's almost unfair.\\" A brief review of the PlayStation version in Next Generation said it was \\"sure to please, especially in two-player mode.\\" The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly applauded the game for its addictive puzzle play, its large amount of content, the usage of tricky bank shots in addition to the color-matching traditional to action puzzlers, and the fierce competitiveness of the two-player mode. Rad Automatic also commented positively on these aspects in Sega Saturn Magazine, and said that though the game is best with two players, the single-player Puzzle Mode makes the game worth buying even for those who have no one to play with. Echoing Next Generation, he remarked that \\"whilst Bust-a-Move 2 maintains the sweet harmless exterior of a sherbert bonbon, inside beats the addictive heart of a malteser.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly named the Saturn and PlayStation versions a runner-up for Puzzle Game of the Year (behind Tetris Attack). It was also a finalist for the Computer Game Developers Conference's 1996 \\"Best Trivia or Puzzle Game\\" Spotlight Award, but lost the prize to You Don't Know Jack XL. PC Zone critically called the Windows version a bad conversion with slowdowns, clunky animation, jerky aiming and blurry high resolution. They recommended buying the Game Boy version instead. =Promotion= The game was showcased at the JAMMA 95 along with Dangerous Curves and Gekirindan.

Social scientists have also applied this work to study hiring bias against mothers and discrimination against loan applicants among other topics. Berger used expectation states theory as an exemplar of formal (or axiomatic) theory construction, for whose wider adoption among sociologists he advocated. Formal theories are logically related sets of statements from which a scientist can logically deduce hypotheses (e.g., if A ‚Üí B and B ‚Üí C, then A ‚Üí C). Formal theorists then lay out the precise conditions under which their predictions do and do not apply. This contrasts with the norm in sociological theorizing, which is less explicit in its definitions, predictions, and scope. He is currently a Professor Emeritus at Stanford University and a senior fellow at its Hoover Institution. Biography A native of Brooklyn, he was educated at Thomas Jefferson High School and Brooklyn College. After earning his doctoral degree in sociology at Harvard University in the 1950s, where he had been taught by Talcott Parsons, he established a theoretical and experimental research program at Stanford. The program, expectation states theory, has many branches and through his mentorship of generations of graduate students, this program has been a unique example of the growth of knowledge in sociology through chains of theory development accompanied by experimental tests and refinements. His expertise is in the area of status processes and status relations among members of different groups, processes of legitimation, reward expectations and distributive justice, and theory construction in the behavioral sciences. His current research focuses on gender relations in interpersonal settings, status characteristics theory, and cumulative theory in social science. Berger, along with collaborators, has edited a large number of books to which invited scholars have contributed papers that elaborate upon one or another \\"sociological theory in progress.\\" Berger is a recipient of the Cooley-Mead Award from the American Sociological Association to honor long- term distinguished contributions to the intellectual and scientific advancement of social psychology. In 2007, he received the W. E. B. Du Bois Award for his contributions to the field of sociology.

Career =Early career= Marriott began his career at Tottenham Hotspur, signing a professional contract in the summer of 1997 following the completion of his two-year youth training scheme. Released by Spurs at the completion of the 1998‚Äì99 season, Marriott linked up with Lincoln City, initially on trial and then on a three-month contract following a recommendation from one-time Lincoln manager and then Tottenham's Director of Youth, Colin Murphy. In October 1999 he agreed a two-year contract with the Imps and went on to make his first team debut on 12 February 2000 in a 2‚Äì1 home victory over Torquay United. He retained his place for the remainder of the season which culminated in him being awarded Lincoln's Young Player of the Year. Marriott began the following season as the established number one choice and, following a series of impressive performances, was rewarded with a new three-year contract at the end of September 2000. In a 1‚Äì1 draw away to Carlisle United on 2 December 2000, Marriott limped off injured after 37 minutes with a knee injury; this kept him away from the first team for a three-month spell. The season would conclude with Marriott named Away Player of the Season. =140 consecutive league appearances= A shaky start to the 2001‚Äì02 season, which saw errors in the games against Halifax Town, Grimsby Town and Scunthorpe United, caused Marriott to be replaced by Paul Pettinger in the Lincoln goal. However, following a 1‚Äì0 home defeat to Bristol Rovers on 15 September 2001, Marriott was restored to first team. Although he was forced off injured at half time in the 1‚Äì0 home defeat to Southend United on 16 March 2003, it would be exactly three years, from the 1‚Äì1 away draw with Luton Town on 18 September 2001, until the 0‚Äì0 away draw with Bristol Rovers on 18 September 2004, before he would miss another league game: a total of 140 consecutive appearances. Injury would cause him to miss the 1‚Äì1 home draw with Chester City on 25 September 2004. =The Keith Alexander era= Following Lincoln's move into administration towards the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season, the club appointed Keith Alexander as manager. Alexander based his team around a solid defensive unit and it was, perhaps, this period which saw Marriott's best performances. Against all expectations, Lincoln reached the play-off final in the 2002‚Äì03 season, conceding just 37 league goals with Marriott keeping 18 clean sheets in the league. Despite the disappointment of defeat in the final to Bournemouth, Marriott agreed a new two-year contract in the summer of 2003. The 2003‚Äì04 season saw Lincoln reach the play-offs once again, with Marriott to the fore with 17 clean sheets in the league, 10 of them away from Sincil Bank. Marriott's efforts were rewarded with second place in the voting for Lincoln's Player of the Season but he collected the Bill Stacey Memorial Trophy after being named Away Player of the Season. The 2004‚Äì05 season saw a third unsuccessful tilt at the play-offs, though Marriott managed to keep 19 clean sheets in the league. He became the 28th Lincoln player to start 250 competitive games when keeping his 72nd Football League clean sheet in the 1‚Äì0 home victory over Swansea City on 9 April 2005; Lincoln manager Keith Alexander recognised the feat by making Marriott captain for the game. In June 2005 he agreed a new three-year contract with the Imps. The 1‚Äì1 home draw with Bury on 15 April 2006 saw Marriott become only the 13th player in Lincoln's history to have started 300 competitive matches. Lincoln marked the occasion by making Marriott captain for the game. =A season of records= The 2006‚Äì07 season saw Marriott once again ever-present in the Lincoln goal, and was memorable not only for him reaching 300 league appearances but also breaking a number of the club's goalkeeping records. The 300th appearance came in the 2‚Äì2 away draw to Bury on 18 January 2007 with Marriott becoming just the ninth player in Lincoln's history to reach this figure. His 309th league appearance in the 1‚Äì0 home victory over Barnet on 17 March 2007 saw him equal Dan McPhail's club record for Football League appearances by a goalkeeper; he would claim the record for himself when appearing in the following week's 3‚Äì2 home defeat to Swindon Town. In keeping a clean sheet in the 0‚Äì0 draw away to Bristol Rovers on 21 April 2007, Marriott equalled McPhail's club record of 97 clean sheets in The Football League whilst simultaneously passing McPhail's total club record of 102 clean sheets; Marriott's clean sheet the following week in the 0‚Äì0 away draw with Grimsby Town saw him surpass The Football League record. =Final Lincoln City season= 2007‚Äì08 began with Marriott achieving yet another notable record: his clean sheet in the 2‚Äì0 victory against Accrington Stanley on 25 August 2007 saw him become the first goalkeeper in Lincoln's history to keep 100 clean sheets in The Football League. However, Lincoln's form in the league was not so notable, resulting in the dismissal of manager John Schofield in October 2007. The newly appointed Peter Jackson's first signing was goalkeeper Ben Smith, on loan from Doncaster Rovers, a move which saw Marriott dropped. Although he retained his place in January, Marriott's contract was not renewed at the end of the season, bringing an end to nine seasons at Lincoln in which he made 351 league appearances, conceding 414 goals and keeping 106 clean sheets in the process. In a poll on the official Lincoln City website of the best 100 players to ever play for the club, Marriott was placed 19th by Lincoln fans. =Rushden & Diamonds and Mansfield Town= On 9 July 2008, Marriott signed for Conference National side Rushden & Diamonds. He made only 12 league appearances for the Diamonds before being signed by Mansfield Town on 8 January 2009 on a short- term contract. Seven clean sheets in his first nine games, in which he conceded just two goals, saw Marriott offered a new contract, which he signed in March 2009. Marriott scored a goal from his own penalty area against Wrexham on 20 April 2012. In May 2012 Marriott signed a new contract ahead of the 2012‚Äì13 season. Marriott made his 200th league appearance for Mansfield in a 1‚Äì0 win over AFC Wimbledon in March 2014. Marriott was offered a new contract at the end of the season, though he left the club after turning it down.

Metula is located between the sites of the Biblical cities of Dan, Abel Bet Ma'akha, and Eyon, bordering Lebanon. In it had a population of . Metula is the northernmost town in Israel. History =Roman and Byzantine periods= A settlement existed in the area in the Roman and Byzantine periods.Alexandre, 2008, MetullaJaffe, 2010, Metulla Ancient wine presses and a mosaic pavement have been found here.Dauphin, 1998, p. 641 A tomb excavated in 1967 contained at least four graves dating from between the late third century and the late sixth century. =Ottoman period= el Mutallah, 1878 The origin of the town's name is . In 1816, the traveller Buckingham visited \\"a large village, called Metully, altogether inhabited by Druses\\".Buckingham, 1825, p. 407 In 1875, Victor Gu√©rin described Methelleh or Metelleh as a village with a spring, occupied by Druzes from the Hauran who cultivated a garden to the east.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 345‚Äì346 Soon afterwards, in 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine recorded \\"El Mutallah: A small village, built of stone, containing about 100 Druzes, situated on slope of hill, near a large stream, surrounded by arable land.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 89 Founding of the Jewish moshava When the Druze Rebellion of 1895 broke out, the men of Mutallah joined its ranks. Since the women were not able to cope with the work, the owner of the land, a Christian from Sidon named Jabur Bey Riskalas (Greek Diplomat to Middle East), sold 12,800 dunams of land to Baron de Rothschild's chief officer Joshua Ossovetski.Morris, 2001, p. 55Avneri, 1984, pp. 96-98 It had been inhabited and cultivated by more than 600 Druze tenant farmers. When the Druze Rebellion was put down, the men returned and demanded their tenancy rights back. Ossovetski called in the Turkish authorities, who came to arrest the Druse as deserters and rebels, while Ossovetski offered them paltry compensation to leave the land. Many were unsatisfied and eight years of feuds and violent clashes ensued. Eventually an agreement was reached between the villagers and the Jewish Colonization Association in 1904 for an additional payment of 60,000 francs (3,000 Turkish pounds). This episode brought much criticism of the methods of Rothschild's agents, including some from other Zionists such as Ahad Ha'am. The Druze moved to other Druze-inhabited villages, including Isfiya on Mount Carmel. The Jewish moshava settlement was founded in June 1896 by 60 farming families from more established settlements and 20 families of non-farming professions. Most of the founders were immigrants from Russia. Pioneers (halutzim) from Petah Tikva also joined in settling Metula, as did some religious scholars from Safed. =Mandatory period= 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt until the 1948 War of Independence At the end of World War I, Metula was in the area of French military occupation.Biger, 2004, p. 134 The British Zionist Norman Bentwich wrote in 1919: :\\"Metullah, the most northern outpost, is acquiring a new function as a summer resort for the rest of the country. Its mountain air and its splendid site, high up above a ravine, down which a stream dashes headlong to Jordan, makes it a chosen place in the dry days, and already its few homesteads are crowded in July and August. Metullah is a summer station for the hardy men and women of the colonies; it lies too far from the high road to attract the tourist, but in course of time it, or some other place in the highland region, will become for the Jewish dwellers of the lowlands what a number of hill stations in the Lebanon are already to the Syrians of the plains.\\"Bentwich, 1919, p. 96 The 1920 boundary agreement between Britain and France stated that Metula was to be in Palestine, but it was not until 1924 that the change to British control was complete. During the intervening years, the residents of Metula even took part in elections for the Lebanese parliament.

On June 17, 1946 (Night of the bridges) all four Palmach battalions (the Haganah elite units) captured and destroyed 11 border bridges. As a consequence, on June 29, 1946 (\\"Black Sabbath\\"), the British soldiers imprisoned many Yishuv leaders and Palmach members. The bridge was blown up again by the Palmach during the War of Independence.

Dozens of soldiers, just returned from Shabbat, were on their way to duty. In accordance with regulations, one armed jeep in the forefront and two on the tail, the soldiers were wearing helmets and bullet-proof vests. They were just crossing the narrow bridge over Nahal Ayyun at 13:45, when they noticed on the other side a red Chevrolet pickup truck driving towards them. The soldiers of the first jeep noticed just one driver, smiling friendly. They signaled him to pull over to let the convoy pass. The first jeep and the first safari truck passed, when at 13:50 a tremendous explosion occurred, which shattered windows even back in Metula. The red truck exploded in a huge fireball, and hurled soldiers through the air. Twelve soldiers were killed and 14 wounded in the explosion. 2006 Lebanon War During the 2006 Lebanon War, Metula became a ghost town as its population temporarily fled to escape Hezbollah rocket fire.

The Triple Alliance was an alliance of British trade unions: the Miners Federation of Great Britain, the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Transport Workers' Federation (an association of dockers, seamen, tramwaymen and road vehicle workers' unions). Formation and pre-war activity After a period of intense industrial unrest beginning in July 1910, the Triple Alliance was formed in early 1914 by the Miners Federation of Great Britain, the newly-unified National Union of Railwaymen and the National Transport Workers' Federation.Lowe, 2010:359 It appeared to signal a significant step towards greater unity and syndicalist ideology within British trade unionism. The onset of the First World War, however, curtailed any imminent action by the Alliance. In his 1936 book, The Strange Death of Liberal England, George Dangerfield argued that if war had not broken out, there would have been a devastating general strike, coordinated by the Triple Alliance, in October 1914.Lowe, 2009:414 First World War There was a cessation of trade union activity during the war. The industries represented by the Triple Alliance (mining, the railways and other transport systems) were temporarily nationalised during the war. Post-war =Black Friday= The mining industry was privatised on 1 April 1921, and the mine owners immediately threatened wage reductions. The Miners' Federation of Great Britain planned a co-ordinated response with its allies in the Triple Alliance on Friday the 15th. Following some confusion over what terms the Miners' Union would be prepared to accept, the transport workers' and railwaymen's unions decided not to call their members on strike in sympathy with the miners. That was subsequently remembered as Black Friday by many socialists and trade unionists, who regarded the collapse of the Triple Alliance as a betrayal of solidarity and a major defeat for trade unionism. =General strike= The Triple Alliance was significant in securing government subsidies for miners' wages on Red Friday in July 1925 by threatening a general strike. The Triple Alliance agreed to back the miners in their dispute against mine owners who had announced future wage cuts and had increased work hours a month previously.

He also produced and starred as Auntie Abigail Prue in Charles Barnard's play The County Fair in 1889. George C. Odell later reflected on these roles: \\"I still see him as Widow Bedott in the kitchen, making pies, straightening out the affairs of the neighborhood and personifying, in spite of his sex, the attribuates of a managing woman. He was not the least bit effeminate, not at all like the usual female impersonator of minstrelsy or of variety, and yet he was Widow Bedott to the life, and with little suggestion of burlesque.\\"Morris, Linda A.

Most of the events related to the fair, however, occur in the city of Aguascalientes, the state capital. The exact date of the fair varies every year but is set around April 25, the Feast Day of San Marcos. Initially the fair was tied to the vendimia (harvesting of grapes) since wine production used to be an important activity in Aguascalientes. Nowadays, it is an important tourist attraction that is heavily associated with bullfighting and cockfighting. It is estimated that seven million people visit the fair every year and as a consequence hotels are usually filled to capacity, however some locals rent out their houses to visitors and go on vacation during this time. Activities Bullfight at the 2010 Fair Feria Nacional de San Marcos 2012. The San Marcos National Fair is organized by an independent foundation that oversees the governance of what happens at the fair, but is supported by the state and city governments of Aguascalientes. The fair is host to a large range of activities, of which bullfighting and cockfighting are the most popular. Usually a concert is given by a prominent Mexican singer after a series of cockfights; this event tends to draw more attention than the fights themselves. Located in the main fair venue are an assortment of sponsored stands and mechanical games, as well as stages where various concerts and theater plays are performed. The livestock fair and the charreadas still remain an important part of the celebration. Parties where traditional Mexican music is played (tamboras) are also celebrated on the streets of Aguascalientes. Finally, a casino is licensed in downtown Aguascalientes just for the occasion. Concerts, art exhibits and other cultural events complement the fair in many locations around the state. The award ceremony of the National Award for Youth Art occurs in Aguascalientes during this time as well. History San Marcos Temple. Attractions at the 2014 Fair The fair was celebrated for the first time around harvest time from November 5 to November 20, 1828, as a showcase of the state's produce and livestock. During that time it was in direct competition with the fairs of Acapulco, Jalapa and San Juan de los Lagos. The celebrations centered in the Pari√°n, a market in the city of Aguascalientes, until 1848. In 1842 the outside balustrade of San Marcos Park was built in a plot of land donated by the Catholic Church. The balustrade is of Neoclassical style and is still preserved to this day. Once San Marcos Park was completed the date of celebration was changed to April to coincide with the festivities in honor the patron saint San Marcos (Saint Mark). Construction of the San Marcos Plaza bullring started in 1896 and was completed in only 48 days. From that date bullfighting was included in the festivities. It was not until 1992 that the much larger Monumental Plaza de San Marcos was built, with a seating capacity of fifteen thousand people. Since 1924 the winner of the beauty pageant has been crowned \\"Queen of the Fair\\". In 2006, after some electoral controversy, three queens were appointed. In 1958 the fair was elevated to the rank of \\"National\\" by President Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos. On April 26, 2009, the fair was canceled due to the pandemic flu virus that was affecting certain areas of Mexico. This was the first time in 181 fairs that the festivities had been canceled. On July 2, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was cancelled for the second time in its history.

The second sequel to Puzzle Bobble, it was released for arcades in September 1996 and later ported to the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, Game Boy, Nintendo 64 and Microsoft Windows. Like its predecessors, the player is tasked with shooting balls at groups of balls, creating groups of three or more, which are then removed from play. The version of the game for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 featured refreshed graphics and new features. It was released as Bust-A-Move 3 DX in Europe (versions for the Game Boy and Microsoft Windows were exclusively released there) and Bust-A-Move 99 in the United States. In Japan, the Nintendo 64 port was released as Puzzle Bobble 64, while the PlayStation version was released as Puzzle Bobble 3 DX. Gameplay The game completely abandons the idea of previous titles that the playfield is being pushed down by some sort of mechanical device and instead attaches groups of bubbles to nodes that move downwards. When a node is no longer connected to any bubbles, it will disappear and when all nodes in a level have vanished the level is complete. As a result, shooting a bubble to the top of the visible playfield without striking any bubbles causes it to bounce and travel back downwards. The player is not penalised if such bubbles again leave the playing field without attaching to anything (except for adding to the number of moves until the field is pushed down by one empty line). Despite this, some versions include a reimplementation of the Puzzle Bobble 2 levels now built around nodes (entitled Version 2.5). Gameplay is further varied by the implementation of new scrolling playfields that are several times as high as the screen and must be conquered as an endurance event. Each scrolling playfield occupies the same space on the world map as five previous levels. This game also marks the introduction of rainbow bubbles into the series - bubbles that are initially transparent and filled with a rainbow. If an adjoining bubble is burst, the rainbow bubbles switch to the colour of the burst bubble, allowing the player to build up chain reactions. The ability to choose a character was introduced, but only to the VS Computer mode. As in Bubble Bobble, the first player controls Bub, and the second player controls Bob. In the Nintendo 64 version, a four-player-simultaneous option is available. Release Puzzle Bobble 3s developer, Taito, also published the game in Japan. The U.S. division of Acclaim Entertainment, which held the rights to publish Taito's games in the Western hemisphere, had dropped support for the Sega Saturn in mid-1997, so the Saturn version was published in North America by Natsume instead. However, Acclaim's European division published the Saturn version in PAL territories. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Puzzle Bobble 3 on their January 1, 1997 issue as being the seventh most- successful arcade game of the year. The Saturn port received moderately positive reviews, with critics voicing approval for the introduction of multiple playable characters with their own individual abilities, the vast number of levels included in the collection mode, and the intensity of the multiplayer gameplay. However, most questioned whether the game's improvements to the series formula were enough to warrant a purchase for gamers who already owned Bust-a-Move 2. GamePro found the reuse of the previous installment's soundtrack and the limited changes to the gameplay in particular doused much of the excitement for the game. Next Generation disagreed, asserting that \\"it's arguable that the formula Taito and Natsume hit on with the Bust-A-Move series needs no major improvements and is sure to please any puzzle fanatic. A must-have classic game.\\" Sega Saturn Magazine concluded that while the game's one-player modes lack sufficient longevity, they are highly enjoyable, and the two-player mode makes Bust-a-Move 3 a great purchase for puzzle fans. While Dan Hsu of Electronic Gaming Monthly argued that the Bust-a-Move games are mindless compared to other action puzzlers, his three co-reviewers all found the game to be great fun, and felt the enhancements were enough to make it worthwhile for veterans of the series. Kraig Kujawa summed up that \\"This game has about everything one could ask for from a sequel that keeps the original gameplay intact.\\" =Promotion= The game was showcased at the JAMMA 96 along with Fighter's Impact and G-Darius.

Career Born in Illinois, Franz Joseph had a successful 30-year career as an aerospace design engineer. However, he is perhaps best known as the author and illustrator of Star Fleet Technical Manual (), which, though fictional, represents an in-universe collection of factual documents, detailing the 23rd century Star Fleet of the United Federation of Planets, as well as the function of the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise relative to the other starships in the fleet. The book contains information about uniforms (complete with sewing patterns), furniture, weapons, devices, protocols, and other minutiae from the Star Trek universe. Franz Joseph is also the author and illustrator of another in-universe document, Booklet of General Plans of the USS Enterprise (, unofficially known as the Star Trek Blueprints), which is to date the only set of blueprints of the original Enterprise ever officially endorsed by Paramount Pictures, owners of the licensing rights to all things Star Trek. On April 14, 1973, Franz Joseph witnessed a group of Star Trek fans at San Diego State University making (in his judgement) poor models of Star Trek memorabilia from various materials, and told them that he thought they could do better. In response, the fans challenged him to make better models than they had made, so Joseph set to work using a process of reverse orthographic drafting to create better models than the fans had. The fans were greatly impressed by his work and started asking him to convert many of the props to plans, essentially asking him to make a \\"technical manual\\" of Star Trek devices. Franz Joseph decided right then to make this manual. After making several technical plans for the Starship Enterprise and several supplemental Federation starships, Franz Joseph sent two of the plans (the plans for the Enterprise and the Dreadnought starship) to Gene Roddenberry, who immediately gave Franz approval to create an official Star Trek Technical Manual. Franz Joseph decided that the manual would be \\"technically and scientifically correct\\". Franz himself has stated that his intention in drawing the plans was to elucidate the ship's design rather than to accurately depict exactly what viewers saw on their television screens. As a result, there are multiple minor discrepancies between Franz's plans and the filming miniatures that were used in the show, all of which are intentional, and made in the interest of establishing greater continuity. This approach was chosen due to the fact that Star Trek contains elements that were never seen on-screen, and the fact that even on-screen information is often contradictory. The plans went on to gain immense popularity and were regarded by the US Department of Education, the National Geographic Society, Grumman Aircraft, and NASA as a topic of discussion. Although they were published after the original show's cancellation, portions of both the Star Trek Blueprints and the Star Fleet Technical Manual have been used as on-screen displays in the Star Trek films and later television series. As an unexpected legacy, Franz Joseph's blueprint and book are responsible for beginning the subgenre revolving around the blueprints and schematics of fictional vehicles and locations from Star Trek: The drawings inspired fans to create their own unofficial blueprints of other invented spacecraft intended to fit into the Star Trek idiom. He is survived by his daughter, Karen Schnaubelt Turner Dick.

Hirsch began to organize transports for children and adolescents in arrangement with the Jewish Reichsvertretung. Between December 1938 and August 1939, she organized ten children's transports to the Netherlands and England. Hirsch took care of all the travel preparations, filling out lengthy forms, registering the children, gathering required documents, sending papers to London, securing exit visas, reserving seating on the trains, buying the tickets and staying in close touch with the parents. She stayed with the remaining pupils as the only Jewish teacher until the school was closed in September 1941. Emigration for Jews was prohibited after 1941. In late January 1942, Hirsch and some of her pupils were deported to the Riga Ghetto. A surviving pupil reports that for a short while she continued to teach children. She also organized meals for weakened people and the elderly. The last time when the surviving student saw her, she was collecting nettles and dandelion leaves to cook as vegetables for the seniors. Hirsch was deported to the Riga Ghetto, where she was killed in 1942 or 1943.

He also contested four 250 cc World Championship races in 1997 and 1998, finishing in the top 8 in all four races. In 2003 he raced in the British Superbike Championship for Rizla Suzuki, alongside double British champion John Reynolds, and had won three races when he crashed heavily at Cadwell Park. He returned for the start of 2004, finishing 3rd in the championship despite not being at full fitness early in the season (a further crash caused a broken collarbone). For he joined Superbike World Champion Troy Corser in the Belgian-based Alstare Suzuki team in the Superbike World Championship, and won races on the GSX-R1000, riding on largely unfamiliar circuits against some of the world's top riders. He finished 5th overall, and did enough to retain his ride for . In the first race, he collided with Noriyuki Haga while battling for the lead on the final lap. He then had a run of poor results, before taking a third and a fourth at Misano, and then an impressive double win from the second row at Brno, nearly doubling his points total in one weekend. He came 7th overall in the series. In 2006 he raced in the final round of the All Japan Road Race Championship at Suzuka as a wild card and won the race. In he remained at Suzuki, but missed four rounds through injury. He finished the season ranked 13th.

Unionville High School is most well known for its enriched arts program, Arts Unionville (formerly known as Arts York). The school was purpose-built to house this regional arts program, therefore it has enhanced arts facilities. Arts Unionville is divided into 4 categories: visual arts, music, dance, and drama. In order to gain entry into the program, grade eight to nine students are required to audition. History In the mid-1970s, Superintendent Stephen Bacsalmsi proposed the idea of an advanced arts program for the region. The Ontario government accepted the idea, but needed to wait for a new high school to be built. When Unionville High School was under construction, the government decided it was a prime opportunity to initiate the program.

The high school enrolls students from all over the Greater Toronto Area. In 2010, due to school board changes, Arts York was forced to change their program name to Arts Unionville and will only take students from the Markham area, except for piano and stringed instruments. Class 2012 was the last year of Arts York. However, in the 2009-10 school year, the program was renamed \\"Arts Unionville\\" ‚Äú Shortly after, the York Region District School Board removed funding for busing, thus eliminating transportation means for long-distance students attending the program. As a result, students were forced to drop out. The decision was protested by many parents and students, and after hiring a lawyer, they settled out of court to have funding for bus transportation reinstated for the rest of the 2008-2009 school year. Students living in areas not around Unionville were expected to attend arts schools in their own districts. As a result, the pool of talent for these programs has significantly declined.

There are four classrooms for music situated in the east wing of the school directly adjacent to the underground link to the Markham Theater. With its strategic placement, it is often said amongst faculty, staff, and students that the Music department is located in its own east wing. The Arts Unionville Music program is separated into six categories: piano, winds, strings, vocal, brass, and percussion. Classes are divided into two types: performance and musicianship. In performance classes, students play scales, studies, and other short pieces. In the musicianship classes, components such as music history, rudiments, and harmony are taught. Arts Unionville Music classes are also taught based on a Day 1/Day 2 timetable. Visual arts The Visual Arts program provides opportunities for individual creative and imaginative growth as well as development of technical skills. In this program, students are introduced to both traditional and experimental perspectives in painting and drawing. They will also be specializing in sculpture, photography, digital, printmaking (etching and silkscreen), and video. Students will also study history of art and will learn to critically analyze their own work, enabling the students to discover individual strengths and directions. For the purpose of developing the aptitudes of talented students interested in the Visual Arts, programs are offered in all four years. Dramatic arts The Drama Department explores university level dramatic arts. Disciplines such as mask, mime, clown and Shakespeare are presented to the actors and explored through self- discovery.http://www.unionville.hs.yrdsb.edu.on.ca/artsunionville/drama_audition.html Many Arts York and Arts Unionville Drama graduates, like Hayden Christensen and Emmanuelle Chriqui, have gone on to professional careers as actors, singers, comedians and production staff in both film and television as well as studied at top institutions such as the National Theatre School.https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2014/01/17/tca_2014_canadian_native_pioneers_wave_of_online_tv.html Dance arts Dance arts is another popular program in Arts Unionville. This program focuses on the development of creativity, artistry, and technique needed to improve dance expression. Students in this program are given opportunities to participate in dance programs such as Dance Access, and The Nutcracker productions in December staged by the National Ballet of Canada. Academic achievement Students at Unionville High School has in recent years performed very well in academics, whether it be in compulsory provincial testing, or in extra-curricular academic competitions. Academically, the Fraser institute 2014 Report Card gave the high school a rating of 9.5/10 and a rank of second out of 740 schools in Ontario, and sixth out of 690 schools in Ontario over the past five years.‚ÄúReport Card for Unionville High School,‚Äù When the Fraser Institute originally began publishing report on Ontario secondary schools in 2001, Unionville was rated at 8.9/10 and ranked at 36 out of 568 schools and 21 out of 349 in Ontario.‚ÄúReport Card on Ontario's Secondary Schools : 2001 Edition ,‚Äù Ranking the schools. No publication date. (Retrieved 2010-10-03.) =Provincial assessment= Each year, Grade 9 students across Ontario are issued province-wide standardized tests in Mathematics. The tests themselves are administered by the Ontario Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO). The Mathematics assessment is graded under the Ontario rubric, where level 3 is considered the provincial standard, and level 4 is considered above the provincial standard. In the 2012-13 academic year: *34% of Unionville students, enrolled in the academic program, scored level 4 in EQAO Math Assessment (only 13% of all students in Ontario achieved this standard).‚ÄúGrade 9 Assessment of Mathematics, 2012-2013, *97% of Unionville students, enrolled in the academic program, scored level 3 or above in EQAO Math Assessment (only 84% of Ontario students achieved this standard). In addition to the Grade 9 mathematics assessment, EQAO also administers the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test, a standardized test for high school students in Ontario who wish to graduate from an Ontario secondary school and obtain their Ontario Secondary School Diploma. The test is written every year on the last Thursday of March in all public secondary schools including Unionville. In the 2009 testing: *96% of Unionville students who were taking the test for the first time passed the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test, (compared to an 82% success rate for the province as a whole).‚ÄúOntario Secondary School Literacy Test, May 2013,‚Äù =Extra-curricular competitions= The school itself has also formed extra-curricular clubs or teams to compete in academic competitions such as the national Reach for the Top trivia game show and the Distributive Education Clubs of America (DECA). Several students representing the school have been sent to represent the province in international DECA competitions, and in some cases, achieving stellar results during the competition.2010 ICDC Business Service Marketing Winners, DECA. 2010.

Roman copy of the original Bryaxis. Bryaxis (; fl. 350 BC) was a Greek sculptor. He created the sculptures on the north side of the mausoleum of Maussollos at Halicarnassus which was commissioned by the queen Artemisia II of Caria in memory of her brother and husband, Mausolus. The three other greatest sculptors of their time, Leochares, Scopas and Timotheus, were each one responsible for one side of the grave. The tomb was completed three years after the death of Mausolus and one year after the death of Artemisia.

This one has been recently lit off, as the exhaust on a fully hot pot becomes almost invisible with a mere hint of red/orange flame. Note that the filler/flue cap is in the fully open position (all holes open). A smudge pot (also known as a choofa or orchard heater) is an oil-burning device used to prevent frost on fruit trees. Usually a smudge pot has a large round base with a chimney coming out of the middle of the base. The smudge pot is placed between trees in an orchard. The burning oil creates heat, smoke, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. It was believed that this oil burning heater would help keep the orchard from cooling too much during the cold snaps. History In 1907, a young inventor, W. C. Scheu, at that time in Grand Junction, Colorado, developed an oil-burning stack heater that was more effective than open fires in heating orchards and vineyards. In 1911, he opened Scheu Manufacturing Company in Upland, California, and began producing a line of orchard heaters. (The firm still exists in 2018.) The use of smudge pots became widespread after a disastrous freeze in Southern California, January 4‚Äì8, 1913, wiped out a whole crop.Staff, \\"FROM OVER HILLS COMES COLD BLAST - And Citrus Men Are Hard Hit, Is Claimed\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Tuesday 7 January 1913, Volume XXXVII, Number 84, page 1. Smudge pots were commonly used for seven decades in areas such as California's numerous citrus groves and vineyards. The Redlands district had 462,000 orchard heaters for the winter of 1932‚Äì33, reported P. E. Simpson, of the supply department of the California Fruit Growers Exchange, requiring 3,693,000 gallons of oil for a single refilling, or about 330 tank car loads. To fill all of the smudge pots in Southern California one time required 2,000 car loads.Staff, \\"Says Growers Are Prepared Against Frost\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Thursday 1 December 1932, Volume 39, Section 2, Page 13. Smudge pot use in Redlands, California groves continued into the 1970s, but fell out of favor as oil prices rose and environmental concerns increased.http://www.kernair.org/Rule%20Book/4%20Prohibitions/421%20Orchard%20Heaters.pdf Pots came in two major styles: a single louvered stack above a fuel oil-filled base, and a slightly taller version that featured a cambered, louvered, neck and a galvanized re-breather feed pipe out of the side of the chimney that siphoned stack gas back into the burn chamber and produced more complete combustion. The Return-Stack heater was developed by the University of California and became commercially available about 1940.Leonard, A. S., and Kepner, Robert A., \\"Return-Stack Orchard Heater\\", California Agriculture, June 1950, page 8.http://calag.ucanr.edu/archive/?type=pdf&article;=ca.v004n06p8 Filler caps have a three- or four-hole flue control. The stem into the pot usually has a piece of oil-soaked wood (\\"down-draft tube and wick\\")Leonard, A. S., and Kepner, Robert A., \\"Return-Stack Orchard Heater\\", California Agriculture, June 1950, page 9. secured inside the neck to aid in lighting the pot. Pots are ignited when the air temperature reaches 29 degrees Fahrenheit (‚àí2 Celsius), and for each additional degree of drop, another hole is opened on the control cap (\\"draft regulator\\"). Below 25 degrees, nothing more can be done to enhance the heating effects. Types and usage 1924 patent diagram Some groves used natural gas pots on lines from a gas source, but these are not \\"smudge pots\\" in the usual sense, and they represented only a fraction of the smudging practice. Experiments using natural gas heaters were conducted in Rialto, California, in 1912.Staff, \\"GAS HEATER IN ORCHARD IS SUCCESS - Experiment Made Yesterday at Rialto Demonstrates the Value of Device\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Friday 21 June 1912, Volume XXXVI, Number 67, page 2. Sometimes, large smudge pots are used for heating large open buildings, such as mechanics' workshops. In Australia they are called \\"choofers\\" because of the noise they make when lit: \\"choofa choofa choofa\\". Lighting an Australian \\"choofer\\" is a tricky business. Because of the voluminous clouds of oily black smoke they produce when cold, they must be lit outside. This is accomplished by holding a burning rag next to the open damper on the fuel tank. The draught caused by the breeze passing through the chimney will draw air through the open damper into the fuel tank, where the surface of the fuel inside will light and burn instantly. Once the choofer is sufficiently warm, the damper may be closed until a steady rate of burning is attained, when the characteristic \\"choofa choofa choofa\\" noise is produced. If the damper is not closed, the choofa may choke itself with its own smoke, causing periodic \\"explosions\\" of unburnt gases in the chimney. Such explosions are not dangerous, but they are noisy and they produce a lot of smoke. Once the heater is burning hot enough, the smoke will disappear and the pot may be dragged slowly and carefully inside. They still produce dangerous gas, and must only be used in well-ventilated spaces. Choofers will burn almost any combustible liquid fuel, including kerosene, diesel fuel, or used sump oil. Prior to the development of battery-powered safety blinkers on saw-horses, many highway departments used small oil-burning safety pot markers to denote work zones, and many railroad systems still rely on oil-fired switch heaters, long tubs of fuel with a wick, that fits between the ties and keeps snow and ice from fouling the points of a switch. This is generally only used in yard applications. Mainline switches are usually heated by natural gas heaters. The smudge pot was also used at construction sites and other cold places to take the chill out of buildings so workers would be comfortable, and for several decades (1920's‚Äì1970's) they were used as emergency night landing illumination at remote airfields without electric runway lights, acting as a series of small bonfires. Use in war Smudge pots were used by the Germans, the Japanese, and the United States Navy during World War II,Morison, Samuel Eliot, \\"History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, Volume XIII, The Liberation of the Philippines - Luzon, Mindinao, the Visayas 1944-1945, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1959, 1989, Library of Congress card number 47-1571, pages 137-138. and by the North Vietnamese in their invasions of Laos during the Vietnam War to protect valuable targets. The oily black clouds of smoke produced from these smudge pots was intended to limit the ability to locate a target. In Vietnam, smoke from smudge pots was used as a defense against laser-guided bombs. Smoke would diffuse the laser beam and break the laser's connection with its intended target. Other significance The smudge pot often became a symbolic prize in high school football rivalry. *Bonita High School and San Dimas High School, affiliated with the Bonita Unified School District in Southern California, compete for a silver-plated smudge pot. *In Redlands, California, Redlands High School and Redlands East Valley High School compete for a blue-and-red smudge pot. *Sometimes called a \\"highway torch\\" these were used to warn oncoming traffic of road maintenance at night.

Early life Thomas Jones was born on 27 September 1870, at 100 High Street, Rhymney, Monmouthshire. He was the first of nine children to David Benjamin Jones and Mary Ann Jones.Ellis, p. 5. His family was Welsh speaking but by the time he was school age, the family usually spoke English except for Sunday School and the chapel.Ellis, p. 12. Welsh was banned at school and Jones later wrote that \\"outside the chapel, I never had a lesson in Welsh\\".Thomas Jones, A Diary with Letters. 1931‚Äì1950 (London: Oxford University Press, 1954), p. 367. His fluency in Welsh in later life was hindered by this but his command of English was excellent.Ellis, p. 12. He was educated at the Upper Rhymney School and Lewis School in Pengam. Jones had failed to win a scholarship at Lewis but his father could afford the school fee.Ellis, p. 10, 14. Jones's grandfather insisted on his leaving school at 14 to work as a clerk in the local ironworks. Jones complied but his interest in reading and his facility in public speaking brought him fame as a preacher. In 1890 he won the Calvinist Methodist scripture gold medal and proceeded to the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth to study for the ministry. New interests intervened, however; and Jones eventually graduated with first-class honours in economics from the University of Glasgow in 1901.http://treaty.nationalarchives.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Jones.pdf In 1902 he married a student from his time at Aberystwyth, Eirene Theodora Lloyd (1875‚Äì1935), daughter of Dr Richard John Lloyd, Reader in Phonetics at Liverpool University.http://treaty.nationalarchives.ie/wp- content/uploads/2011/11/Jones.pdf There were three children from the marriage: Eirene White (1909‚Äì99), who became a Labour Minister under Harold Wilson (1966‚Äì70), Tristan (1913‚Äì90), who became managing director of The Observer, and Elphin, who died in a motoring accident in 1928.http://treaty.nationalarchives.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Jones.pdf Jones pursued at first an academic career after graduation from Glasgow. He was Russell Student at the London School of Economics; Barrington Lecturer in Ireland (1904‚Äì05); Assistant to the Professor of Political Economy and Lecturer in Economics at Glasgow; and Professor of Economics, Queen's University Belfast, 1909‚Äì10.Who's Who 1948, London : A. & C. Black, 1948, pg.1486 In 1914 Jones started the monthly journal Welsh Outlook to promote \\"national social progress\\" in Wales.Ellis, p. 158. He was the journal's de facto editor for its first three years.Ellis, p. 159. Civil service He became familiarly known as \\"T.J.\\" He was Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet under four Prime Ministers: David Lloyd George, Bonar Law, Stanley Baldwin and Ramsay MacDonald. His 3-volume Whitehall Diary (1969, 1971) threw much light on politics \\"behind the scenes\\", including the Irish Treaty, the 1926 General Strike, the Cliveden Set, and so on. When Baldwin became Prime Minister in 1923, he decided to retain Jones as Deputy Secretary, telling him on the day he was appointed Premier: \\"I shall want you to hold my hand, Tom\\".Ellis, p. 253. Baldwin appreciated Jones' value and they would remain friends for more than twenty years.Keith Middlemas and John Barnes, Baldwin: A Biography (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1969), p. 169.Ellis, p. 253. During their first serious meeting, Baldwin expressed concern about the effects on Britain's commerce from the economic troubles in Europe. Jones immediately focused the conversation on to the social consequences.Ellis, p. 254. Baldwin told Jones in 1929: > I am a Tory P.M., surrounded with a Tory Cabinet, moving in Tory circles. > You don't let me forget or ignore the whole range of ideas that normally I > should never be brought up against if you were not in and out of this room. > You supply the radium...you have such an extraordinary width of friendships > in all classes, and so many interests that through you I do gather > impressions of what is being thought by a number of significant people whose > minds I should not know, at any rate so well, but for your help. I think > every Tory P.M. ought to have someone like you about the place.Keith > Middlemas (ed.), Whitehall Diary: Volume II, 1926‚àí1930 (London: Oxford > University Press, 1969), pp. 167-168 A friend of many rich and influential people including the Astors, Jones excelled at extracting money from rich people for worthwhile causes, notably adult education: he founded Coleg Harlech in Gwynedd in 1927, was secretary, trustee and chairman of the Pilgrim Trust from 1930, and was instrumental in the founding of Newbattle Abbey College in Midlothian in 1937. His contacts were useful in other situations too: for example, it was he who introduced Gareth Jones, subject of the 2019 film Mr Jones, to Lloyd George. Later life He was Chairman of Gregynog Press throughout its existence, and also helped set up CEMA, the Committee for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (forerunner of the Arts Council) as well as the Army Bureau of Current Affairs (designed to 'supply mental stimulant' to British troops during the Second World War). Jones wrote the Dictionary of National Biography entries for three Prime Ministers: Lloyd George, Bonar Law and Baldwin.Ellis, pp. 526-527. Towards the end of his life Jones became President of the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, and was awarded the Gold Medal of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, as well as finally agreeing to become a Companion of Honour. He died in London on 15 October 1955. Jones's daughter, Eirene White, became a Labour politician and minister. Assessment His biographer, Dr E. L. Ellis, claimed that Jones was invaluable to Lloyd George in dealing with the trade unions and the Irish Question, along with dissuading Baldwin from taking revenge in the aftermath of the General Strike. He \\"was on the side of light...A passionate belief in moderation and compromise\\" was central to Jones. Ellis also claims that Jones's philanthropy was matchless amongst his contemporaries: \\"he was the incarnation of public-spiritedness\\". Ellis called Jones, with Lloyd George and Aneurin Bevan, \\"the three greatest Welshmen in public life\\" in the twentieth century.Ellis, pp. 535‚Äì537. The military historian Correlli Barnett in his history of Britain's international relations in the interwar period, called Jones \\"a man of simplicity and naivete remarkable in politics even for that age\\".Correlli Barnett, The Collapse of British Power (London: Eyre Metheun, 1972), p. 455.

Rudolf Breitscheid (2 November 1874 - 28 August 1944) was a leading member of the Social Democratic Party and a delegate to the Reichstag during the era of the Weimar Republic in Germany. Breitscheid, the son of a bookshop manager, was born in Cologne. He studied at a Gymnasium (an academically-oriented secondary school) in Cologne. From 1894 to 1898 he studied Economics at the Universities of Munich and Marburg; in 1898 he obtained his doctorate with a dissertation entitled \\"Land Policy in the Australian Colonies\\". From 1898 to 1905, he worked as an editor and correspondent for newspapers with a middle- class, liberal outlook. Between 1903 and 1908, Breitscheid was a member of the Free-minded Union. In 1908, he numbered among the founding members of the left-liberal Democratic Union (DV) and, until the Reichstag elections of 1912, served as its chair. After the DV foundered in the 1912 elections, Breitscheid joined the SPD, switching five years later to the more leftist splinter faction, the USPD (Independent Social Democratic Party). During the years of the First World War, he was the SPD faction's spokesman for foreign policy, as well as member of the German delegation to the League of Nations. After Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in 1933 Breitscheid and all members of the SPD present voted against the Enabling Act of 1933. Especially Breitscheid and Otto Wels were singled out later by Konstantin von Neurath as example that acts of terror against different minded persons are a \\"calumny\\". He emigrated to France by way of Switzerland, with the help of Alfred Faust.Sees Rebirth of War Time Propaganda, Berlin 1933-03-26. St. Joseph Gazette, St. Joseph, Missouri, 1933-03-27. There, efforts were undertaken by the Refugee Committee, under Varian Fry, to get him out of Vichy France, along with Rudolf Hilferding. These efforts were not successful, and in 1941, approximately a year into the German occupation of France, he was arrested by the Gestapo and interned in the Buchenwald concentration camp. The precise details of Breitscheid's last years are known only sketchily. According to the historian Nikolaus Wachsmann he died during an Allied air raid on 24 August 1944. Varian Fry instead believed that Breitscheid was murdered by the Gestapo on the orders of Hitler or another senior Nazi Party official. The high-profile communist Ernst Th√§lmann was executed in the camp on the same day as Breitscheid died, with Th√§lmann‚Äôs murder concealed at the time as a death from an air-raid. He is buried in the Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery in the borough of Lichtenberg in Berlin. Today, a square in the centre of Berlin is named after Breitscheid, while in Oberhof, Kaiserslautern, Potsdam, Leverkusen,Leverkusen, Rudolf-Breitscheid-Str. at www.leverkusen.com and Dresden, as well other parts of eastern Germany, there are streets bearing his name. Some of the streets named after him in eastern Germany have, since 1989, been renamed.

Soon after Crowdy's arrival to Washington, D.C., this building was purchased by the congregation in 1903. The Church of God and Saints of Christ is a Black Hebrew Israelite religious group established in Lawrence, Kansas, by William Saunders Crowdy in 1896. William Crowdy began congregations in several cities in the Midwestern and Eastern United States, and sent an emissary to organize locations in at least six African countries. The congregation later established locations in Cuba and the West Indies. Religious beliefs * First Key: The Church of God and Saints of Christ [I Corinthians 1:2] * Second Key: Wine is forbidden to be drank in the Church of God forever [Leviticus 10:9] * Third Key: Unleavened bread and water for Christ's body and blood [Matthew 26:26‚Äì28] * Fourth Key: Foot-Washing is a commandment [John 13:1-8] * Fifth Key: The Disciple's Prayer must be taught [Matthew 6:9‚Äì14] * Sixth Key: You must be breathed upon and saluted into the Church of God with an holy kiss. [John 20:22, Romans 16:16] * Seventh Key: The Ten Commandments must be kept forever [Exodus 20:1‚Äì18, Revelation 22:14] Bishop W. S. Crowdy said, ‚ÄúMy teacher is the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.‚Äù He preached that Jesus is the Son of God. Presently different beliefs are practiced by other organizations who claim to be followers of Bishop William Crowdy. A main branch of the organization, headquarters in Belleville, VA, gravitated towards Judaism after the death of Bishop William Crowdy. On the other hand, another main branch, headquarters in Cleveland, OH, claims adherence to the founder's original teachings of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The Church of God and Saints of Christ, headquarters in Belleville, VA, describes itself as \\"the oldest African-American congregation in the United States that adheres to the tenets of Judaism.\\"\\"The founding dates of the earliest black-Jewish congregations are in dispute. Shapiro notes that F.S. Cherry's Church of God was organized in Tennessee in 1886, but other sources do not confirm this date. Another group, the Moorish Zion Temple, founded in 1899 by a Rabbi Richlieu of Brooklyn, New York, was one of the earliest black Jewish congregations that did not combine Jewish and Christian beliefs, as did the Church of God and the Saints of Christ.\\" The congregation subscribes to the belief in one God, love for all mankind, and the Ten Commandments as the basis for ethical and moral living. It further teaches that, among the descendants of the biblical Israelites, there are peoples of African descent. The congregation believes \\"in the equality of all men, and the equality of the sexes. . Members believe that Jesus was neither God nor the son of God, but rather a strict adherent to Judaism and a prophet sent by God. They also consider William Saunders Crowdy to be a prophet. Religious rituals The Church of God and Saints of Christ synthesizes rituals drawn from both the Old Testament and New Testament. Its observances based on the Old Testament include circumcision of newborn boys, use of the Hebrew calendar, the wearing of yarmulkes, observance of Saturday as the Sabbath, and celebration of Passover and other religious holy days specified by the Bible. Its rites based on the New Testament include baptism (immersion), the consecration of bread and water as Christ's body and blood, and footwashing. Despite the name of the faith, members of the Church of God and Saints of Christ do not believe in Christianity; they adhere to Judaism as their religion. Facilities The group established its headquarters in Philadelphia in 1899, and William S. Crowdy later relocated to Washington, D.C., in 1903. In 1906, Crowdy named Joseph Wesley Crowdy, William Henry Plummer, and Calvin Samuel Skinner as leaders of the congregation. This book cites the appointment of William Crowdy's three successors (J. Crowdy, W. Plummer, C. Skinner) as the most significant event to take place at the nationwide Passover in 1906 held in Plainfield, NJ. Led by these three individuals, the organization continued to grow in membership. In 1921, William Henry Plummer moved the organization's headquarters to its permanent location in Belleville (city of Suffolk), Virginia, which was purchased by William S. Crowdy in 1903 as the intended headquarters for the organization. Howard Zebulun Plummer was consecrated by Calvin S. Skinner as head of the organization in 1931, and served for over 40 years until 1975. By 1936, the Church of God and Saints of Christ had more than 200 \\"tabernacles\\" (congregations) and 37,000 members. Levi Solomon Plummer became the church's leader in 1975. Under the leadership of Levi Solomon Plummer, the congregation constructed a temple at its headquarters, Temple Beth El, in two phases, the first in 1980 and the second in 1987. Afterwards, the congregation began to rebuild the headquarters land in Virginia originally purchased by William S. Crowdy. In 2001, the Church of God and Saints of Christ was led by Rabbi Jehu A. Crowdy, Jr., a great-grandson of William Saunders Crowdy. After his death on April 10, 2016 at the age of 46. Chief Rabbi Phillip Eugene McNeil took over its leadership. As of 2005, it had fifty tabernacles in the United States, dozens in Africa, and one in Kingston, Jamaica. The organization also manages businesses and residential properties at its headquarters in Suffolk, Virginia, including a hotel and two living communities for senior citizens. Independent branches As early as 1909, local branches of the organization severed their ties with the congregation, forming their own organizations. This book was published from an interview the authors conducted with James M. Grove, an early follower of William S. Crowdy. Walker's wife was a granddaughter of William S. Crowdy. William \\"Bill\\" Crowdy was a grandson of \\"Prophet\\" William S. Crowdy. In this account, Grove, ordained bishop of the western district by the organization's founder, details his involvement at the center of several actions made by some to take over the congregation after the death of William S. Crowdy. Grove cites in this book that following a lawsuit pursued by Grove against Joseph Wesley Crowdy for control of the entire church, Pennsylvania courts awarded the entire congregation to Joseph W. Crowdy, and Grove as bishop of the western district, both appointments originally designated by the founder. Grove further commented that as a result of the verdict, Grove and other ministers formed their own congregation, separate from Joseph Crowdy and the leadership set up by William S. Crowdy. Grove also cited his regret for his involvement in the schism of 1909, and made an attempt to mend the ties of his organization with the parent organization in 1930 under William H. Plummer, but his plans were impeded by an automobile accident near Alexandria, VA. No longer circulated.

Background  After the Mahdi retreated into Kordofan in 1881 he started to raise an army there and in Darfur. A force of 4,000 was sent to capture him, but it was ambushed near El Obeid and destroyed, and all of its equipment captured. The Mahdi's forces had grown spectacularly, and by 1883 British sources placed their size at 200,000, although that is almost certainly an overestimate. The Egyptian Governor, Rauf Pasha, decided that the only solution to the growing rebellion was a fight, and against the advice of his British advisors started to raise an army of his own. He hired a number of European officers to lead his force, placing them under the command of William \\"Billy\\" Hicks, a retired colonel who had experience in India and Abyssinia. Hicks' force was composed mostly of Egyptian soldiers who had been imprisoned after fighting in the Urabi Revolt. They were released for service in Sudan and accordingly showed little inclination to fight. They initially stayed near Khartoum and met small portions of the Mahdist forces on April 29, near the fort of Kawa, on the Nile, beating them off without too much trouble. Similar skirmishes followed over the next few weeks. Later during the summer of 1883 they heard that the Mahdi himself was besieging El Obeid, a small town set up by the Egyptians some years earlier and now the capital of Kordofan. The Egyptian officials decided to capture him and, despite Hicks' reluctance, planned an expedition from their current location at Duem on the Nile to El Obeid, about 200 miles away.  Battle  The Kordofan expedition was made up of about 8,000 Egyptian regulars, 1,000 bashi-bazouk cavalry, 100 tribal irregulars and 2,000 camp followers. They carried supplies for 50 days on an immense baggage train consisting of 5,000 camels. The army also carried some ten mountain guns, four Krupp field guns and six Nordenfeldt machine guns. By the time the expedition started El Obeid had fallen, but the operation was maintained to relieve Slatin Bey, the Governor of Darfur. The force was, in the words of Winston Churchill, \\"perhaps the worst army that has ever marched to war\\"--unpaid, untrained, undisciplined, its soldiers having more in common with their enemies than with their officers. Either by mistake or by design, their guides led them astray, and they soon found themselves surrounded. The regulars' morale plummeted and they started to desert en masse. After marching for some time they were set upon by the entire Mahdist army on November 3. The Egyptian forces quickly formed into a defensive square. According to reports published in England soon after, the square held for two days before finally collapsing. About one-third of the Egyptian soldiers surrendered and were later freed, while all the officers were killed. Only about 500 Egyptian troops managed to escape and make it back to Khartoum. Neither Hicks nor any of his senior officers were among them. Among non-combatants killed were Edmund O'Donovan of The Daily News and Frank Vizetelly of The Graphic. After the battle the Mahdist army made El Obeid a center for operations for some time. Their success also emboldened Osman Digna, whose Hadendoa tribesmen, the so-called fuzzy-wuzzies, joined the rebellion from their lands on the Red Sea coast.

The game has two main variants, and all Hasami variants, unlike other shogi variants, use only one type of piece, and the winning objective is not checkmate. One main variant involves capturing all but one of the opponent's men; the other involves building an unbroken vertical or horizontal chain of five-in-a-row. Hasami shogi possesses simple rules while offering complex strategy. Variant 1 is popular among Japanese children.Pritchard (1994), p. 65 Variant 1 Play is on a traditional shogi board, with each player having nine men. Traditional shogi pawns (fu) can be used as men; unpromoted pawns (Ê≠©) for Black (ÂÖàÊâã sente), promoted pawns („Å®) for White (ÂæåÊâã gote). At the start of the game each player's pieces fill their first , with Black's men on the lower side of the board. Black moves first, then players alternate turns. A player wins by capturing all but one of their opponent's men. =Moving= All pieces move the same as a rook in shogi. (That is, any number of empty cells vertically or horizontally.) A move consists of moving a piece to an empty cell of the board. As in shogi there is no jumping, so a piece can move no further than adjacent to a friendly or enemy piece in its path. =Capturing= An opponent's piece is captured using the : the player occupies the two cells adjacent to the piece either horizontally (on a rank) or vertically (on a file). An enemy piece in a corner cell can be captured by occupying the two cells that orthogonally surround it. Captured pieces are removed from the game. Multiple pieces can be captured in a single move if all the cells between the capturing player's two pieces are filled by enemy men. A player can safely move a piece to a cell between two enemy pieces without being captured. Likewise, it is safe to move a piece to complete a chain of friendly pieces flanked by two opponent pieces‚Äînone of the \\"sandwiched\\" pieces are captured. Variant 2: Dai hasami shogi In this variant each player starts the game with 18 pieces occupying their two nearest ranks. Since most shogi sets have only 9 pawns for each side, this game is usually played using black and white Go stones. Additionally, one-quarter (9√ó9 grid) of a Go board can be used in lieu of a shogi board. All the move and capture rules of Variant 1 apply, but the winning objective is different, and a jumping move is possible. =Winning= A player wins by building an uninterrupted line of five stones either horizontally or vertically, all of which must lie outside of the starting two rows of that player. =Jumping= A piece can move by jumping an orthogonally adjacent piece of either color, to the empty cell immediately beyond it in the same direction. The jumped piece is not captured. Multiple jumps in a single turn are not permitted. Other variations =Main variant variations= The main variants have been described also with differences in one or more rules. In variations where pieces move one step only, develops slower. Variant 1 variations: * To win, all enemy men must be captured.Bell (1979), p. 98 * Instead of moving like rooks, pieces can move only one step to an adjacent empty cell. To win, all enemy men must be captured. * Instead of moving like rooks, pieces can move only one step to an adjacent empty cell. Each player starts with 18 pieces instead of 9. To win, all enemy men must be captured.Diagram Group (1975), p. 56 Variant 2 variations: * A player can win by building five-in-a-row diagonally (in addition to orthogonally).Bell (1979), p. 97 * Instead of moving like rooks, pieces can move only one step to an adjacent empty cell. A player can win by building five-in-a-row diagonally (in addition to orthogonally). =Mak-yek= A similar game is played in Siam (and Malaysia under the name Apit-sodok) with the same goal. On an 8√ó8 board, each player's 16 stones are placed on the first and third rows. The moves are the same, but captures are by intervention in addition to the custodian method. Intervention capture is the opposite of custodian capture: if a stone moves between two enemy stones, it captures both stones. =Take= A hexagonal variant invented in 1984 by Mike Woods.

The picture was one of the Stooges' few feature-length films made during the run of their better-known series of short subjects for Columbia Pictures, although the group had appeared in supporting roles in other features. It is the only Stooges feature-length film with the team's best known line-up (Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Curly Howard) in starring roles. Plot While his cousin Rusty Williams (Jay Kirby) is away at Agricultural College, prospector Shorty (Moe) fills in at Rusty's struggling Reno, Nevada spread as the ranch foreman. He spends his time looking for an angle at the Wagon Wheel Cafe Casino, and hooks up with two vagrants (Larry and Curly) after they accidentally win big at roulette. Along with two stranded New York singers (Mary Beth Hughes, Gladys Blake) and their money, the Stooges and the girls head for the ranch with prospecting plans. Rusty returns home with hope that investor Sam Clemens (Forrest Taylor) will save the ranch's cattle and mining operations, and finds Shorty and the gang's plans interfering. Complicating matters further, inept ranch hands (The Hoosier Hotshots) mistake Clemens for a cattle rustler, and Shorty, Curly and Larry cook up a scheme to get the girls an audition with a vacationing Broadway producer (Tim Ryan). Cast * The Three Stooges as Themselves  Moe Howard as Shorty Williams (Ranch Foreman) (as The Three Stooges)  Larry Fine as Larry (a Vagrant) (as The Three Stooges)  Curly Howard as Curly (a Vagrant) (as The Three Stooges) * Mary Beth Hughes as June McGuire * The Hoosier Hotshots as Ranch Hands / Musicians * Ken Trietsch as Hotshot Ken (as The Hoosier Hotshots) * Paul Trietsch as Hotshot Hezzie (as The Hoosier Hotshots) * Charles Ward as Hotshot Gabe (as The Hoosier Hotshots) * Gil Taylor as Hotshot Gil (as The Hoosier Hotshots) * Jay Kirby as Rusty Williams * Cappy Barra Boys as Harmonica Musicians * Gladys Blake as Betty Vale * Tim Ryan as Tom Trove * Spade Cooley as Spade Cooley (as Spade Cooley King of Western Swing) * Forrest Taylor as Sam Clemens (uncredited) Production and reception Rockin' in the Rockies featured musical numbers by Western Swing orchestra Spade Cooley and the Hoosier Hot Shots.Hoosier Hot Shots in Rockin' in the Rockies The Hoosier Hotshots were comedic musicians but, unlike Spike Jones' orchestra, their country-swing music never hit mainstream playlists and they are relatively unknown today. Oddly, Moe plays straight man as a non- Stooge character, with Larry and Curly interacting as a comedy duo. Curly is relatively subdued, as his mannerisms and reactions were starting to slow down by this time. Filmed on December 1‚Äì22, 1944,threestooges.net shortly after Idiots Deluxe, Curly (who noticeably played trombone in both films) was a few short weeks away from suffering a minor stroke, one that would hamper his remaining time with the Stooges. In addition, his falsetto voice sounds hoarse and strained. As a result of Moe being cast separately from the team, Larry awkwardly assumes Moe's role as leader of the duo. As author Jon Solomon put it, though the Stooges do give the film \\"all the energy they can muster ... when the writing divides them into a duo and a solo, they lose their comic dynamic.\\" Solomon continues: > \\"Rockin' in the Rockies ignored many of the ingredients that were making > contemporary Stooge short-films so successful. Writers Johnny Grey and J. > Benton Cheney, who had barely written for the Stooges before, separated the > Stooges and left Moe to act solo, including very few slapstick exchanges, > and omitted an effective foil whom the Stooges could abuse or frustrate.

The group eventually achieved some feature film success with a series of full-length pictures made during a television-fueled resurgence after Columbia had ended their series of shorts. Beginning with 1959's Have Rocket, Will Travel, these later films starred Moe, Larry, and Joe DeRita, who joined the group after the deaths of both Curly and Shemp Howard and the departure of comedian Joe Besser.

Since the setting was originally published in a folio and then again in a boxed set that were both titled World of Greyhawk, the word \\"Greyhawk\\" is often used to describe the entire campaign world setting, although the proper name for that part of the world is the Flanaess. Sometimes the lands controlled by the Free City are also referred to as Greyhawk, though the proper term for the region is the Domain of Greyhawk. Early development In 1972, after seeing a demonstration of Dave Arneson's Castle Blackmoor game,Gygax: \\"Dave was running a man-to-man (1 figure = one person) Chainmail fantasy campaign around then, and he... came down from the Twin Cities to see us, the gaming group, in Lake Geneva in the late autumn of 1972. Arneson brought some of his campaign material with him...\\" game designer Gary Gygax agreed with Arneson to co- develop a set of rules for a game that would eventually become known as Dungeons & Dragons. Gygax liked the idea of a castle and dungeon that players could explore,Gygax: \\"Credit Dave Arneson and Dave Megary (designer of the Dungeon! boardgame) with my concentrating on subterranean settings for the D&D; game. The contained adventuring environment was perfect for establishing fixed encounters before a game session, and for developing progressively more hazardous ones as the PCs grew in their capacity to manage them.\\" and created his own imaginary place called Castle Greyhawk, which he used to test and develop the game. About a month after his first session, Gygax created the nearby city of Greyhawk, where the players' characters could sell their treasure and find a place to rest.Gygax: \\"The castle and dungeons came about a month before the first, one-page map of the City of Greyhawk.\\" The lands around Greyhawk gradually grew into an entire world as Gygax's players explored further and further afield. In 1980, Gygax published details of his home campaign in a folio called The World of Greyhawk. This was the first published information about the City of Greyhawk. The Free City of Greyhawk, Gem of the Flanaess, is the adventuring town that gives the World of Greyhawk setting its name. Game designer Ken Rolston comments: \\"The City of Greyhawk is an organism of systems within systems, with each system driven by its own motivations and personalities. [...] External politics are intertwined in the city‚Äôs internal affairs. Rival guilds compete for power and influence, and dark conspiracies fester beneath the streets, while less-weighty adventures may arise from the lighter aspects of civilized personal and commercial rivalries.\\" The release of The World of Greyhawk (1980) was planned to begin a new emphasis on the Greyhawk campaign world, with plans for Minifigs of the UK working on an \\"Armies of Greyhawk\\" set of miniatures rules, while TSR was planning a \\"City of Greyhawk\\" folio, but none of these publications appeared. Publication history Greyhawk: Gem of the Flanaess from The City of Greyhawk boxed set (TSR, Inc., 1989); Cover art by Erik Olson In 1983, TSR, Inc. replaced the folio edition with the World of Greyhawk boxed set, which contained more detailed information about the city and some of its prominent citizens, as well as background information for several small adventures set in the city. By 1983, Gygax was planning a City of Greyhawk publication to be followed by a Castle Greyhawk publication, both to come after the World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting (1983), although the Greyhawk revival began to fade after 1984. His development for the Castle and City of Greyhawk and the Wild Coast was never finished. Gygax's first Greyhawk novel Saga of Old City (1985) \\"became a major source of Greyhawk lore because novelistic details about currencies and the feel of the city of Greyhawk immediately surpassed anything that had ever been printed in RPG supplements,\\" according to author Shannon Appelcline. In 1985, just before Gary Gygax was forced out of TSR, he wrote the first two Gord the Rogue novels, which provide many interesting details of the city of Greyhawk and its seamy underworld. With Gygax gone, the vision of the city became TSR's, and in 1988, the company published Jim Ward's Greyhawk Adventures hardcover source book, which provided additional information regarding the city as well as interesting characters living within it. The City of Greyhawk boxed set published by TSR in 1989 is the most complete treatment of the Free City. The box contained * Gem of the Flanaess‚ÄîA Gazetteer of the Free City of Greyhawk and the surrounding area by Douglas Niles, a 96-page book * Folks, Feuds and Factions: The good, the bad, and the in-between‚ÄîPeople who make the city what it is a 96-page book by Carl Sargent and Rik Rose, * three maps (city streets, city sewers, and the region surrounding Greyhawk) * a wall poster of the city * 23 \\"adventure cards\\", double-sided 8¬Ω x 11 pieces of card stock containing the outline of an adventure in the city The following year, in conjunction with this boxed set, TSR published a trilogy of adventure modules by Richard & Anne Brown ‚ÄîWGA1 Falcon's Revenge, WGA2 Falconmaster and WGA3 Flames of the Falcon‚Äîset in the city and centred around a mysterious villain called \\"The Falcon.\\" After Gygax left TSR, the two long-awaited supplements appeared: The City of Greyhawk (1989) box was an in-depth look at one city, while WGR1: Greyhawk Ruins (1990) presented the dungeons under Greyhawk Castle in a serious way. Appelcline commented on the Greyhawk setting after Gygax left TSR: \\"TSR published only scattered RPG supplements until AD&D; second edition, which saw the publication of the beautiful The City of Greyhawk (1989) box and the WGR1: Greyhawk Ruins (1990) book. Neither of these locales had much in common with the original locations created by Gygax & Kuntz almost 20 years prior, showing how Greyhawk continued to metamorphize and change ‚Äî though James M. Ward and some of players of those early games did try to get the feel right. Around the same time, TSR published Robin Wayne Bailey‚Äôs Nightwatch (1990) novel, which was set in Greyhawk City but didn't feature the \\"Greyhawk Adventures\\" trade dress at all ‚Äî showing the weakness of the setting at TSR.\\" The fourth module of the WGA (World of Greyhawk Adventures) series, WGA4Vecna Lives!, was not part of the Falcon series, but was set in Greyhawk City. Treasures of Greyhawk (1992) and Return of the Eight (1998) were two others set entirely within the city. The Campaign Book from the 1992 boxed set From the Ashes, focuses on the areas in and around the Free City of Greyhawk, which game designer Rick Swan described as \\"a virtuoso performance, with a flawless mix of exposition, atmosphere, and detail [...] painting a bleak picture of a struggling populace. As a consequence of the great war, much of the Old City was incinerated. Destitute property owners who can‚Äôt afford to pay for restoration watch helplessly as their neighborhoods are overrun with beggars and street urchins. In the River Quarter, authorities fish out body after body with daggers in their backs. Refugees crowd the poorer districts, trade continues to decline, and Iuz, the fiendish ruler of a vast territory in the north central Flanaess, remains a constant threat. Uncertainty prevails, and player characters will find plenty to keep them on their toes.\\" The set moved the timeline of the overall World of Greyhawk setting ten years forward to just after the Greyhawk Wars, included information regarding the City's situation, as well as additional adventure cards set in the City. After TSR was taken over by Wizards of the Coast, the World of Greyhawk setting was updated again, and publications of this time period such as Greyhawk: The Adventure Begins (1998), the Living Greyhawk Gazetteer (2000), and Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk (2007) also provide information regarding the city in the post-wars period. =Outside of TSR= In 1988, New Infinities Productions revealed that its \\"Fantasy Master\\" line would start detailing the Castle and City of Greyhawk (renamed as \\"Castle Dunfalcon\\") as Gary Gygax and Rob Kuntz had originally envisioned them; however, the company dissolved before any of this went into publication; Applelcline noted that \\"Gygax's plans to publish the City and Dungeon of Greyhawk in a renamed setting were somewhat fulfilled at Troll Lord Games, who published a few Castle Zagyg books ‚Äî detailing the uppermost levels of the dungeon ‚Äî before Gygax's death.\\" Summary of published information about the city The following represents a summary of information taken from the various published sources mentioned above that a player would be able to use: =History= Early history Greyhawk, named for the small grey hawks which populate the region, was originally a trading outpost on the Selintan River specializing in local wood and woven garments. In time the town developed strong textile and meat-packing industries. Eventually, Greyhawk came to be ruled by a warlord, who took the title \\"Lansgraf of the Selintan\\". His son was then married to the Gynarch of Hardby's daughter. The nuptials formalized a political alliance that served as the basis for rule over the Lanstadt of Selintan, an area that eventually became known as the Domain of Greyhawk. In 4 CY, Greyhawk came under the domination of the Great Kingdom of Aerdy and remained so while strong Overkings ruled from the Malachite Throne in Rauxes. By the 3rd century CY, the Great Kingdom's influence over the city began to wane as the Overkings fell into evil ways and their hold on distant provinces became increasingly tenuous. Rise to prominence, decline and recovery  Circa 310 CY, the mage Zagig Yragerne emerged from the Wild Coast and bribed his way into a seat on the Directing Oligarchy. Soon after, the Oligarchs elected Zagig Lord Mayor. Greyhawk subsequently rose in fame and prominence under the leadership of Lord Mayor Zagig. He instituted legal reform, developed a new currency, fortified the walls, founded the city's first university and embarked on a major building program. Most notably, he directed the construction of nearby Castle Greyhawk. Although Zagig‚Äîlater known as Zagyg‚Äîbecame increasingly erratic over time, his rule is generally considered to be the most effective in the Free City's history and brought widespread prosperity to the region. Much to the annoyance of Dyvers and other rival cities, Zagig proclaimed Greyhawk to be the \\"Gem of the Flanaess,\\" and did much to ensure this moniker was justified. Unfortunately, the \\"Mad Archmage\\" suddenly disappeared in 421 CY, leaving no clues regarding his whereabouts, and no heir to inherit the title of Lansgraf. In 498 CY, after decades of Zagig's absence, the Lanstadt was therefore abolished, the title of Lansgraf permanently retired, and the Free City's Directing Oligarchy assumed political authority. The new Lord Mayor Paerinn officially proclaimed Greyhawk a free city, though it had been effectively independent of the Great Kingdom's rule for over a century. Soon thereafter, the city lost its claim over Hardby and the Wild Coast, as the leading women of Hardby broke from Greyhawk and established the ruling office of Despotrix. This loss of lands sent the Free City into economic decline, a situation that persisted for several decades. Fortunately, the discovery of treasure in the dungeons beneath Castle Greyhawk and other nearby locales set off a gold rush of sorts, and Greyhawk's economic fortunes recovered substantially in the second half of the 6th century. The Greyhawk Wars and the post-war situation The Free City of Greyhawk actually had less direct involvement in the so-called Greyhawk Wars than many political entities across the Flanaess, but because the final truce was brokered in Greyhawk in CY 584, the war has come to be named for the city. The current timeline of the Greyhawk campaign has been fixed as 591 CY, six years after the end of the Greyhawk Wars. The Wars had several important effects on the city, particularly that the unrest drove Hardby and the Wild Coast cities of Safeton and Narwell to re-submit to the rule of the Directing Oligarchs. However, since it was largely fear of Turrosh Mak's humanoid raiders from the Pomarj that prompted this move, a situation that has been resolved to some extent, the Despotrix and the Wild Coast cities are once again agitating for increased independence. Also as a result of the Wars, the city has seen an influx of new citizens. Some of these are wealthy diplomats, and some are \\"nobles\\" who have contributed significantly to Greyhawk's coffers with the purchase of various counterfeit titles and documents. But many newcomers to Greyhawk are destitute refugees, or are merely using the city as a base for hatching political plots and intrigues across the Flanaess. In particular, there are persistent rumors of covert Scarlet Brotherhood operations in the city. The post-war outlook for the Free City is therefore mixed. Greyhawk's finances are in the best shape they have been since Zagig's departure, but the city faces significant challenges arising from political instability and increasing criminal activity. =Geography= The Free City of Greyhawk is located centrally in the Flanaess, which is the easternmost part of the continent of Oerik on the world of Oerth. The city controls a large swath of land along the Selintan River from the Nyr Dyv south to Woolly Bay most of the Cairn Hills, parts of the Gnarley Forest, the northern Wild Coast, and parts of the Abbor-Alz. The entire region is officially known as the Domain of Greyhawk. The Domain is bordered on the east by the Abbor-Alz and its western border lies within the Gnarley Forest. The area south of Greyhawk City along the Selintan is known as the Plain of Greyhawk. Settlements Several settlements fall within the Domain of Greyhawk: *Blackstone *Diamond Lake *Elmshire *Ery Crossings *Erybend *Greatrock *Greyhawk City *Greysmere *Grossetgrottel *Hardby *Magepoint *Narwell *One Ford *Phandlish *Safeton *Steaming Springs *Two Ford =People= Population As of 589 CY, the city itself boasted a population of 69,500, making it one of the largest cities on Oerth. The population for the entire Greyhawk Domain is roughly 160,000, including the larger towns of Safeton (pop. 6,100), Hardby (pop. 5,100) and Elmshire (pop. 4,000). Religion The Free City of Greyhawk hosts temples and shrines to many deities, including Beory, Boccob, Celestian, Corellon Larethian, Ehlonna, Fharlanghn, Garl Glittergold, Heironeous, Istus, Kord, Kurell, Lirr, Moradin, Norebo, Obad-Hai, Olidammara, Osprem, Pelor, Pholtus, Procan, Ralishaz, Rao, Saint Cuthbert, Trithereon, Ulaa, Wee Jas, Xerbo, Yondalla, and Zilchus. The worship of evil deities and fiends is forbidden, and such cults, though they may have followers, do not have a public presence. Evil religions that have established a base in the city in recent memory include those of Incabulos, Iuz, Nerull, and Vecna. Many more deities are worshipped in other settlements of the Domain of Greyhawk. See also: List of Greyhawk deities Languages The most widely spoken language in Greyhawk City and most of the Domain is Common, though other tongues are spoken in settlements with large non-human populations, such as Elmshire, Greysmere, and Grossetgrottel. =Government= Administrative Divisions The Domain of Greyhawk has no officially named provinces. Some of the region's settlements are under the direct rule of the Free City, while others have varying degrees of autonomy. Notable settlements include: *The Free City of Greyhawk *Blackstone -A mining town in the Cairn Hills directly controlled by Greyhawk City *Diamond Lake - A mining town in the Cairn Hills directly controlled by Greyhawk City *Elmshire - A large halfling town on the Nyr Dyv, east of the Selintan *Greysmere - A dwarven stronghold south of the Mistmarsh *Grossetgrottel - A gnome warren located in the northwestern Cairn Hills *Hardby - A small, virtually autonomous port city on Woolly Bay, east of the Selintan *Magepoint - A coastal village east of Elmshire, under the protection of Tenser the archmage *Narwell - A large inland town on the former Wild Coast *Safeton - A small port city on the former Wild Coast, virtually under martial law *Steaming Springs - A mining town in the Cairn Hills directly controlled by Greyhawk City Executive branch Greyhawk's Directing Oligarchy elects one of its own to as Lord Mayor, who serves as the head of state in addition to his directorial duties. The current Lord Mayor, Nerof Gasgal, has held office since 571 CY. The Lord Mayor heads both the Directing Oligarchy and the Council of Mayors and Manorial Lords. The chief of state also officially heads the military, though actual command is most often left to the Captain General of the Watch. Legislative branch The Free City of Greyhawk is ruled by the Directing Oligarchy, an executive council of twelve to eighteen members representing the City's major professional guilds and the military. In some cases, the Oligarchy may include important wizards or clerics. New Directors are chosen by current council members when a vacancy must be filled. The Greyhawk Council of Mayors and Manorial Lords is an annual assembleage of leaders from the various baronies and towns in Greyhawk Domain. In theory, this gathering allows citizens of the Domain to have a voice in the governance of the region, but in practice this Council has little real authority. Judicial branch Major legal matters in the Free City of Greyhawk are adjudicated by a Judge of Greyhawk, one of eight such officials appointed by the Directing Oligarchy. One of these eight is chosen to serve as Chief judge of Greyhawk, a position currently held by Sir Anton Palmirian who also sits on the Directing Oligarchy and oversees the Guild of Lawyers and Scribes. In cases of great import, three Judges of Greyhawk may preside. Appeals of major cases are always heard by a panel of three Judges of Greyhawk, though the Lord Mayor sometimes sits in place of one of the Judges. Lesser matters in Greyhawk City are tried by magistrates from the Guild of Lawyers and Scribes. Heraldry The city's coat of arms is blazoned thus: Sable, a castle triple-towered argent, in chief two chains each of four links chevronwise of the second, in base six bezants. =Economy= Resources The Free City of Greyhawk controls most of the Cairn Hills, which provide the domain with great mineral wealth, such as iron, gems, and silver. Nearby Castle Greyhawk, with its extensive dungeons, draws adventurers and traders to the Domain of Greyhawk from across the Flanaess. As such, the Castle generates significant economic benefits for the City in trade, taxation and treasure. Currency The Domain of Greyhawk's standard coinage consists of the platinum plate (pp), gold orb (gp), electrum lucky (ep), silver noble (sp), and copper common (cp). All of the coins are round, except for the platinum plate, which is square. The current coinage system replaced the previous system, which included coinage worth less than the copper common known as bronze zees, brass bits, and iron drabs. =Transportation= Several roads link the settlements of the Domain of Greyhawk, including the High Road (from Greyhawk City to Elmshire), the Urnst Trail (from the High Road to the Duchy of Urnst), the Western Road (from Ford Keep on the Selintan to Dyvers), and the River Road (south from Greyhawk City along the Selintan). Much river traffic takes place along the Selintan River, which can accommodate all but the largest sea-going vessels from the Nyr Dyv and Woolly Bay. Smaller vessels ply the Ery and Neen rivers. Able Carter The Able Carter is a coach company created by author Erik Mona, and first appeared in the 2000 RPGA adventure module, River of Blood. It has coaching inns in Greyhawk City, Hardby, Diamond Lake, Blackstone, Elmshire, Steaming Springs, Narwell, Safeton, and Dyvers, among other locations.Mona, Erik. \\"Backdrop: Diamond Lake.\\" Dungeon #124 (Paizo Publishing, 2005).Mona, Erik.

The current Captain General is Tigran Gellner. Greyhawk's forces consist of several units, including: *The Cairn Hills Force, led by Commander Schinus Balint. *The Greyhawk Mountaineers, led by Commander Carstane Geronten. *The Hardby Marines, led by Commander Wilbrem Carister. *The Narwell Headhunters. *The Safeton Garrison, led by Commander Turin Deathstalker. *The \\"Water Rats.\\" References Further reading * *Bailey, Robin Wayne.

The western continuation (to Park Lane) is called Upper Brook Street; its west end faces Brook Street Gate of Hyde Park. Both sections consisted of neo-classical terraced houses, mostly built to individual designs. Some of them were very ornate, finely stuccoed and tall-ceilinged, designed by well known architects for wealthy tenants, especially near Grosvenor Square, others exposed good quality brickwork or bore fewer expensive window openings and embellishments.

The amide group of glutamate is a nitrogen source for the synthesis of glutamine pathway metabolites. Other reactions may take place via GS. Competition between ammonium ion and water, their binding affinities, and the concentration of ammonium ion, influences glutamine synthesis and glutamine hydrolysis. Glutamine is formed if an ammonium ion attacks the acyl-phosphate intermediate, while glutamate is remade if water attacks the intermediate. Ammonium ion binds more strongly than water to GS due to electrostatic forces between a cation and a negatively charged pocket. Another possible reaction is upon NH2OH binding to GS, rather than NH4+, yields Œ≥-glutamylhydroxamate.  Structure  Glutamine synthetase, 12 subunits Glutamine synthetase can be composed of 8, 10, or 12 identical subunits separated into two face-to-face rings. Bacterial GS are dodecamers with 12 active sites between each monomer. Each active site creates a ‚Äòtunnel‚Äô which is the site of three distinct substrate binding sites: nucleotide, ammonium ion, and amino acid. ATP binds to the top of the bifunnel that opens to the external surface of GS. Glutamate binds at the bottom of the active site. The middle of the bifunnel contains two sites in which divalent cations bind (Mn+2 or Mg+2). One cation binding site is involved in phosphoryl transfer of ATP to glutamate, while the second stabilizes active GS and helps with the binding of glutamate. Hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions hold the two rings of GS together. Each subunit possesses a C-terminus and an N-terminus in its sequence. The C-terminus (helical thong) stabilizes the GS structure by inserting into the hydrophobic region of the subunit across in the other ring. The N-terminus is exposed to the solvent. In addition, the central channel is formed via six four-stranded Œ≤-sheets composed of anti-parallel loops from the twelve subunits.  Mechanism  GS catalyzes the ATP-dependent condensation of glutamate with ammonia to yield glutamine. The hydrolysis of ATP drives the first step of a two-part, concerted mechanism. ATP phosphorylates glutamate to form ADP and an acyl-phosphate intermediate, Œ≥-glutamyl phosphate, which reacts with ammonia, forming glutamine and inorganic phosphate. ADP and Pi do not dissociate until ammonia binds and glutamine is released. ATP binds first to the top of the active site near a cation binding site, while glutamate binds near the second cation binding site at the bottom of the active site. The presence of ADP causes a conformational shift in GS that stabilizes the Œ≥-glutamyl phosphate moiety. Ammonium binds strongly to GS only if the acyl-phosphate intermediate is present. Ammonium, rather than ammonia, binds to GS because the binding site is polar and exposed to solvent. In the second step, deprotonation of ammonium allows ammonia to attack the intermediate from its nearby site to form glutamine. Phosphate leaves through the top of the active site, while glutamine leaves through the bottom (between two rings). Two views of glutamine synthetase PDB ID: 1FPY  Biological function  GS is present predominantly in the brain, kidneys, and liver. GS in the brain participates in the metabolic regulation of glutamate, the detoxification of brain ammonia, the assimilation of ammonia, recyclization of neurotransmitters, and termination of neurotransmitter signals. GS, in the brain, is found primarily in astrocytes. Astrocytes protect neurons against excitotoxicity by taking up excess ammonia and glutamate. In hyperammonemic environments (high levels of ammonia), astroglial swelling occurs. Different perspectives have approached the problem of astroglial swelling. One study shows that morphological changes occur that increase GS expression in glutamatergic areas or other adaptations that alleviates high levels of glutamate and ammonia. Another perspective is that astrocyte swelling is due to glutamine accumulation. To prevent increased levels of cortical glutamate and cortical water content, a study has been conducted to prevent GS activity in rats by the use of MSO.  Classes  There seem to be three different classes of GS: * Class I enzymes (GSI) are specific to prokaryotes, and are oligomers of 12 identical subunits. The activity of GSI-type enzyme is controlled by the adenylation of a tyrosine residue. The adenylated enzyme is inactive.InterPro:IPR001637 Glutamine synthetase class-I, adenylation site * Class II enzymes (GSII) are found in eukaryotes and in bacteria belonging to the Rhizobiaceae, Frankiaceae, and Streptomycetaceae families (these bacteria have also a class-I GS). GSII are decamer of identical subunits.. Plants have two or more isozymes of GSII, one of the isozymes is translocated into the chloroplast. Another form is cytosolic. The cytosolic GS gene translation is regulated by its 5' untranslated region (UTR), while its 3' UTR plays role in transcript turnover. * Class III enzymes (GSIII) have, currently, only been found in Bacteroides fragilis and in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. It is a double-ringed dodecamer of identical chains. It is much larger (about 700 amino acids) than the GSI (450 to 470 amino acids) or GSII (350 to 420 amino acids) enzymes. While the three classes of GSs are clearly structurally related, the sequence similarities are not so extensive.  Regulation and inhibition  Regulation of GS only occurs in prokaryotes. GS is subject to reversible covalent modification. Tyr397 of all 12 subunits can undergo adenylylation or deadenylylation by adenylyl transferase (AT), a bifunctional regulatory enzyme. Adenylylation is a post- translational modification involving the covalent attachment of AMP to a protein side chain. Each adenylylation requires an ATP and complete inhibition of GS requires 12 ATP. Deadenylylation by AT involves phosphorolytic removal of the Tyr-linked adenylyl groups as ADP. AT activity is influenced by the regulatory protein that is associated with it: PII, a 44-kD trimer. PII also undergoes post-translational modification by uridylyl transferase, thus PII has two forms. The state of PII dictates the activity of adenylyl transferase. If PII is not uridylylated, then it will take on the PIIA form. The AT:PIIA complex will deactivate GS by adenylylation. If PII is uridylylated, then it will take on the PIID form. The AT:PIID complex will activate GS by deadenylylation. The AT:PIIA and AT:PIID complexes are allosterically regulated in a reciprocal fashion by Œ±-ketoglutarate (Œ±-KG) and glutamine (Gln). Gln will activate AT:PIIA activity and inhibits AT:PIID, leading to adenylylation and subsequent deactivation of GS. Furthermore, Gln favors the conversion of PIID to PIIA. The effects of Œ±-KG on the complexes are opposite. In the majority of gram-negative bacteria, GS can be modified by adenylylation (some cyanobacteria and green algae or exceptions). Glutamine synthetase activity influenced by its regulatory protein, which is designated PII Inhibition of GS has largely focused on amino site ligands. Other inhibitors are the result of glutamine metabolism: tryptophan, histidine, carbamoyl phosphate, glucosamine-6-phosphate, cytidine triphosphate (CTP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Other inhibitors/regulators are glycine and alanine. Alanine, glycine, and serine bind to the glutamate substrate site. GDP, AMP, ADP bind to the ATP site. L-serine, L-alanine, and glycine bind to the site for L-glutamate in unadenylated GS. The four amino acids bind to the site by their common atoms, ‚Äúthe main chain‚Äù of amino acids. Glutamate is another product of glutamine metabolism; however, glutamate is a substrate for GS inhibiting it to act as a regulator to GS.2 Each inhibitor can reduce the activity of the enzyme; once all final glutamine metabolites are bound to GS, the activity of GS is almost completely inhibited. Many inhibitory input signals allows for fine tuning of GS by reflecting nitrogen levels in the organism. Feedback regulation distinguishes the difference between two eukaryotic types of GS: brain and non-brain tissues. Non-brain GS responds to end-product feedback inhibition, while brain GS does not. High concentrations of glutamine-dependent metabolites should inhibit GS activity, while low concentrations should activate GS activity. Methionine sulfoximine acting as an inhibitor to the glutamate binding site Inhibitors: * Methionine sulfoximine (MSO): MSO is an inhibitor that binds to the glutamate site. Bound to GS, MSO is phosphorylated by ATP that results in an irreversible, non- covalent inhibition of GS. The S-isomer configuration is more inhibitory. Glutamate entry is blocked into the active site by a stabilization of the flexible loop in the active site by MSO. * Phosphinothricin(PPT, Glufosinate): Phosphinothricin is an inhibitor that binds to the glutamate site. Glufosinate is used as an herbicide. Glufosinate treated plants die due to a buildup of ammonia and a cessation of photosynthesis. * Many synthetic inhibitors are available today. Research on E. coli revealed that GS is regulated through gene expression. The gene that encodes the GS subunit is designated glnA. Transcription of glnA is dependent on NRI (a specific transcriptional enhancer). Active transcription occurs if NRI is in its phosphorylated form, designated NRI-P. Phosphorylation of NRI is catalyzed by NRII, a protein kinase. If NRII is complexed with PIIA then it will function as a phosphatase and NRI-P is converted back to NRI. In this case, transcription of glnA ceases. GS is subject to completely different regulatory mechanisms in cyanobacteria. Instead of the common NtrC-NtrB two component system, cyanobacteria harbour the transcriptional regulator NtcA which is restricted to this clade and controls expression of GS and a multitude of genes involved in Nitrogen metabolism. Moreover, GS in Cyanobacteria is not covalently modified to raise sensitivity for feedback inhibition. Instead, GS in Cyanobacteria is inhibited by small proteins, termed GS inactivating factors (IFs) whose transcription is negatively regulated by NtcA. These inactivating factors are furthermore regulated by different Non-coding RNAs: The sRNA NsiR4 interacts with the 5'UTR of the mRNA of the GS inactivating factor IF7 (gifA mRNA) and reduces its expression. NsiR4 expression is under positive control of the nitrogen control transcription factor NtcA. In addition, expression of the GS inactivating factor IF17 is controlled by a glutamine-binding riboswitch.

In Tibetan King of Nangchen's realm was called the \\"nyishu dza nga\\" or the 21 (provinces). Since 1959 it is mainly within the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai province in China (historically part of Kham, eastern Tibet). Yushu Prefecture is 97% ethnic Tibetan.Surmang Foundation web site The Surmang region is one of the poorest regions in China ranking it among the world's highest infant and maternal mortality, almost 100% illiteracy, and personal income of less than US 14¬¢/day. It is part of the catchment in China of the 30 million ultra-poor. Surmang also refers to a complex of nine or ten Kagyu monasteries (gompas) in that area. These include: Surmang Namgyal Tse, Surmang Dutsi Til, Surmang Do Gompa, Surmang Doka Gompa, Surmang Kyere Gompa. The lineage held therein, known as the Surmang Kagyu, is a subschool of the Karma Kagyu yet it includes a unique synthesis of Nyingma teachings. They are led historically by the GharTengTrungSum (sum means three), namely the Gharwang tulkus, the Tenga tulkus and Trungpa t√ºlkus. Surmang Kagyu =History= Surmang Monastery () was founded about 600 years ago by Trungmase, a student of Deshin Shekpa, the 5th Gyalwa Karmapa. The name in Tibetan means \\"many cornered\\" referring to the irregularly shaped reed huts used by the first monastics in the area. Arhat Abheda, 17th-century painting from Surmang Monastery The 1st Trungpa Rinpoche, Kunga Gyaltsen, was a principal student of Trungmase (the 1st Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche, also well known as Matiratna, or as Lodro Rinchen, which was given by the 5th Gyalwa Karmapa). Small Surmang is the seat of the Surmang Trungpa tulkus, the line of incarnate lamas particularly associated with the sub-complex Dudtsi-til. The Surmang Trungpa Rinpoches was historically the closest students of Trungmase (1st Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche), along with the eight tongdens (other close students of the founder of the Surmang group). Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche, Zurmang Tenga Rinpoche and Zurmang Trungpa Rinpoche are together considered the \\"Three Pillars of Surmang (GharTengTrungSum).\\" Accounts of Trungmase and the traditional hierarchy of Surmang differ somewhat. In his autobiography, Born in Tibet, Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche asserts that Trungmase did not take rebirth, and that the Trungpa tulkus were thereafter traditionally supreme abbots of all of Surmang. However, Trungmase is said to have reincarnated and his line of tulkus is known as the Gharwang tulkus. The Gharwang tulkus have traditionally been the abbots of the main Surmang monastery, Namgyal-tse, and in this role lead the Surmang Kagyu tradition. In 1976 the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa enthroned the 12th Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche as the 12th incarnation of Trungmase and an emanation of Tilopa.Documentation from the enthronement of the 12th Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche The Surmang monasteries, through their long history, were exposed to violence. Dudtsi-til Monastery was razed twice by the armies of the Central Government of Tibet, the most recent time being in the 1930s, when the Central Government tried to collect taxes in Tibetan areas of Qinghai. The Surmang monasteries were again largely destroyed during the Chinese invasion of Tibet and the subsequent Cultural Revolution.\\"The Surmang Project,\\" Konchok Foundation website. Prior to the Chinese take-over, the monasteries owned over 90% of the land in Tibet. One result of the Chinese invasion was the disestablishment of all the monasteries, meaning that they, along with all other monasteries lost their land holdings after 1959 and thus ceased to be an economic or political force. In addition they could no longer be supported by the institution of share cropper nomads and farmers. \\"Trungpa Rinpoche XII and Surmang Monastery,\\" Rokpa Foundation websiteBorn In Tibet (4th ed.) by Chogyam Trungpa. Shambhala Publications, 2000 pg 153-4. In recent years Namgyal-tse has been largely restored under the leadership of the 12th Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche. Dutsi-til Monastery is being steadily reestablished under the leadership of Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, the spiritual leader of Shambhala Buddhism and son of Ch√∂gyam Trungpa, the 11th Surmang Trungpa. The 2010 Yushu earthquake made it necessary to raze the ancient assembly hall, all of whose costs have been borne exclusively by local support: the monastery, local business community and the Yushu Government.Konchok foundation fall 2006 newsletter Konchok foundation fall 2006 newsletter The present regent abbot of Dutsi-til is Aten Rinpoche. The titular head of the monastery is Choseng Trungpa Rinpoche, the 12th Trungpa Tulku. The three famous Tulkus from Zurmang are well known with the name GharTengTrungSum (Gharwang, Tenga, Trungpa Rinpoche). Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche II and Zurmang Tenga Rinpoche II are the grandson of TrungMase / Matiratna (1st Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche). =Surmang Foundation= Surmang Foundation was founded in 1988 by Lee Weingrad following his trip to the region in 1987, making him the first Westerner to visit the region. In 1991, the Foundation went into partnership with the Dutsi Til Monastery and the Qinghai Provincial Government resulting in the construction of a clinic. The agreement, the first one signed by the Chinese Government with a foundation in Qinghai, opened the door for other foundations in Qinghai, most notably the Konchok Foundation. Since 1991 the foundation provides community development and health services to the region, including support of monks, nuns, and visitors to the facilities at the retreat center of Dorje Khyung Dzong. The Foundation was also responsible for the arrangements and logistics of the 2001 visit of Trungpa Tulku XI's son, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche. Gurdjieff connection theory The Greek-Armenian philosopher and mystic G.I. Gurdjieff claimed that a mysterious Sarmoung monastery was a major source of the teachings he brought to the West. As such, it has never been located, but the Canadian diplomat and Gurdjieffian James George has speculated, on the basis of the similar name and location, that Surmang may be real basis of the Sarmoung monastery.

It was founded as Northampton Town and County Grammar School in 1541 by Thomas Chipsey, Mayor of Northampton. Years 7 to 11 are boys-only, while Sixth Form classes are mixed. The school generally ranks among the best- performing in the county.  Foundation and history  The school was founded in 1541 by mayor Thomas Chipsey, as the town's free boys grammar school. In 1557, the school moved to St. Gregory's church, which was adapted for its use. The School remained on this site until 1864, when it moved to the Corn Exchange in the Market Square. In 1870, additional premises were opened in Abington Square to educate a further 200 pupils. Due to its popularity, the school moved again in 1911, to new buildings constructed on the present site at Billing Road. During this period the school was known as the Northampton Town and County Grammar School. In 1992, the school became Grant Maintained, later becoming a Foundation school. Under the leadership of Sir Bruce Liddington, followed by Sir Michael Griffiths, it prospered as a prominent and over-subscribed school. From 1994, the school's GCSE results improved year upon year, and became the only school nationally to achieve an 11-year period of continual improvement. Michael Griffiths, headmaster, was knighted in the 2014 New Years Honours list for services to Education. Since 2014 Richard Bernard (Ex-OFSTED inspector) has taken over the role of headmaster once Sir Michael Griffiths had retired. During the 1990s, the school allowed the admission of girls into the Sixth Form. Currently up to a quarter of the Sixth Form can be girls. In the summer of 1999 the school completed a new complex, Cripps Hall, named in honour of Sir Humphrey Cripps, philanthropist and Cambridge-educated former pupil of the school. It includes a theatre used for school productions and concerts as well as public performances. The building is home to the School's Expressive Arts and Modern Foreign Languages departments, as well as the theatre, drama workshop and Lounge. During 2004, Northampton switched back to the two-tier system, once again making Northampton School for Boys a secondary school; consequently, the school had to admit pupils from the age of eleven. To cope with the increased numbers, the school for two years occupied a second campus (\\"Northampton School for Boys West\\") at the former Cliftonville Middle School‚Äîseparated from the main site by St Andrew's Hospital‚Äîfor the new year sevens and eights. With the completion of the RIBA award-winning new building, all pupils were located back on the main site. In 2010, Northampton School for Boys became an academy.  Achievements  The school has achieved recognition for its success, particularly in the areas of sport and music. Six music groups from the school achieved places in the 2009 finals of the National Festival of Music for Youth. Out of these, the Jazz Big Band won the tournament, and two other groups finished as runners-up in their categories. In November 2007 the Schools 'Jazz Vocal Group' was invited to perform at the prestigious Music for Youth Proms at the Royal Albert Hall. In December 2005 NSB was named Daily Telegraph 'State School of the Year' for its achievements in sport. =Gifted pupils= The school was selected to be an ambassador school for the NAGTY due to its excellent gifted and talented programme, which was hailed as a model system by DfES. =Sport= In terms of sport, the school has had a number of its former students go into professional rugby, but many have achieved international recognition in a range of sports. Particular strengths are rugby, football, cricket, basketball, cross country, athletics and rowing, but there are also competitive fixtures in hockey, swimming, badminton and netball. A notable feature is that Saturday fixtures are still a part of NSB life, unlike most state schools. An unofficial report stated: \\"The PE staff at the school are of the highest quality, and the general enthusiasm is immense throughout lessons.\\" On 20 May 2013, the Under 13 (year 8) age group won the English School's Football Association National Cup 4-3 AET, defeating Walkwood CE Middle School, Redditch, at Chesterfield F.C.'s Proact Stadium. This marked the first Football National Cup triumph for the school, and the second final. On 16 March 2016, the Under 15 (year 10) age group won the football National Cup, securing a 2-1 victory over football specialist school Thomas Telford School, at the Madejski Stadium, Reading.http://www.nsb.northants.sch.uk/the- school/latest-news/nsb-u15-national-football-champions-2016  Buildings  The centre of the school is occupied by the 1911 Building, which over the years has been extended to include an extension to the library and which is now attached to the science and technology blocks and the new (2006) building. In the summer of 1999 the school completed the Cripps Hall, named in honour of Sir Humphrey Cripps, a former pupil of the school. It includes a theatre used for school productions and concerts as well as public performances. The building is home to the School's Expressive Arts and Modern Foreign Languages departments. Beginning in 2005, the school has had a refurbishment and building programme, called Project 465 (the school was to be 465 years old when finished, but because of building delays it was 466), which was finished in early 2007. One of the purposes of the programme was to accommodate the newly added years sevens and eights. Constructed in a post-modern style, the building features new English and mathematics classrooms, alongside two new ICT suites, a sixth form lounge (known colloquially as \\"The Pod\\") a 'restaurant/bistro' and a concourse for indoor recreation at breaktimes. In addition, the Edward Cripps Human Performance Centre has been built which is home to a new pool, with a floor capable of raising and lowering to change the depth of the pool, a dance studio and an extension to the fitness suite, alongside a number of changing rooms. The facilities cost ¬£4.9 million, and was opened in December 2014 by Rebecca Adlington, a former competitive swimmer.  Admissions  Northampton School for Boys is heavily oversubscribed at both age 11 and age 16 and selection criteria for admission are applied. Boys at age 11 were formerly admitted on the basis of an application form, in which parents were encouraged to make the most of their child's interests and achievements. The school now uses 3 criteria to admit pupils: a sibling link, an aptitude for music or technology, and finally a fair allocation system using banding to create an equal spread of abilities. The sixth form is open to students from all schools and has an admissions number for external students of 60. Places are allocated by sitting a test, the top 60 being admitted. Each year there are approximately 550 first choice applications to join Y7 and 300 applications from students currently in Year 11 at other schools. Girls are admitted to the 6th form.

It consists of the grid of streets north of the Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio, roughly between the Cais do Sodr√© and the Alfama district beneath the Lisbon Castle, and extends northwards towards the Rossio and Figueira squares and the Avenida da Liberdade (Lisbon), a tree-lined boulevard noted for its tailoring shops and cafes. History Plan of reconstruction after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake by Eug√©nio dos Santos and Carlos Mardel. The Pombaline Baixa is an elegant district, primarily constructed after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. It takes its name from Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal, the Prime Minister to Joseph I of Portugal from 1750 to 1777 and key figure of the Enlightenment in Portugal, who took the lead in ordering the rebuilding of Lisbon after the 1755 earthquake. The Marquis of Pombal imposed strict conditions on rebuilding the city, and the current grid pattern strongly differs from the organic streetplan that characterised the district before the earthquake. The Pombaline Baixa is one of the first examples of earthquake- resistant construction. Architectural models were tested by having troops march around them to simulate an earthquake. Notable features of Pombaline structures include the Pombaline cage, a symmetrical wood-lattice framework aimed at distributing earthquake force, and inter-terrace walls that are built higher than roof timbers to reduce fire contagion.

It seeks to identify and characterize the genetic and environmental influences on the development of psychological traits. Principal investigators include Matt McGue, William Iacono, and Kevin Haroian.  Cohorts  The primary cohorts of participants include the Minnesota Twin Family Study, Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study, Minnesota Twin Registry, and a variety of other cohorts of participants. = Minnesota Twin Family Study = MTFS is a twin study established in June 1989 with 1300 same-gendered twin pairs age 11 or 17, with an additional cohort of 500 such pairs recruited around 2004. Twins were born between 1972 and 2000. All twins born in MN at that time were eligible to participate using birth registry data. Both identical and fraternal twins share certain aspects of their environment. This allows researchers to estimate the relative impact of environmental and genetic influences on phenotypes. The focus of the MTFS is on behavioral phenotypes, such as academic outcomes, cognitive abilities, personality, and interests; family and social relationships; mental and physical health; physiological measurements. The assessment wave structure and protocol are similar to the Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study (below), allowing the use of complementary twin and adoption designs to address behavioral genetic questions. = Minnesota Twin Registry = The Minnesota Twin Registry was established in 1983. Its original goal was to establish a registry of all twins born in Minnesota from 1936 to 1955 to be used for psychological research. Recently, it has added twins born between 1961 and 1964. It primarily conducts personality and interests tests with its 8,000+ twin pairs and family members via mail. From this project, it was able to confirm that twins and their families are representative of the population and that a poll of their opinions would be more accurate than polls in the newspaper. = Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study = The Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study (SIBS) is a study of >600 adoptive and non-adoptive families. The adoption study design allows one to disentangle the environmental and genetic influences on a phenotype, including psychological phenotypes. The assessment wave structure and protocol are similar to the Minnesota Twin Family Study, allowing the use of complementary study designs to answer a given question.  Other Behavioral Genetic Studies at the University of Minnesota  = Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart = The Minnesota Study of Twins Reared apart was a twin study conducted at the University of Minnesota, independent of the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research. In 1979, Thomas J. Bouchard began to study twins who were separated at birth and reared in different families. He found that an identical twin reared away from his or her co-twin seems to have about an equal chance of being similar to the co-twin in terms of personality, interests, and attitudes as one who has been reared with his or her co-twin. This leads to the conclusion that the similarities between twins are due to genes, not environment, since the differences between twins reared apart must be due totally to the environment. Psychologist now refer to studies such as this as an Adoption Strategy.The Psychology of AdoptionDepression: Theories and Treatments: Psychological, Biological, and Social  References   Further reading  Farber, S.

Buckminster Fuller who defined it as a systematic form of designing. He expanded on this concept in his World Design Science Decade proposal to the International Union of Architects in 1961. The term was later used by S. A. Gregory in the 1965 'The Design Method' Conference where he drew the distinction between scientific method and design method. Gregory was clear in his view that design was not a science and that design science referred to the scientific study of design. Herbert Simon in his 1968 Karl Taylor Compton lectures used and popularized these terms in his argument for the scientific study of the artificial (as opposed to the natural). Over the intervening period the two uses of the term (systematic designing and study of designing) have co-mingled to the point where design science may have both meanings: a science of design and design as a science.

The Sciences of the Artificial, MIT Press. first published in 1969, built on previous developments and motivated the further development of systematic and formalized design methodologies relevant to many design disciplines, for example architecture, engineering, urban planning, computer science, and management studies. Simon's ideas about the science of design also encouraged the development of design research and the scientific study of designing. There has been recurrent concern to differentiate design from science. Nigel Cross differentiated between scientific design, design science and a science of design. A science of design (the scientific study of design) does not require or assume that the acts of designing are themselves scientific, and an increasing number of research programs take this view. Cross uses the term 'designerly ways of knowing' to distinguish designing from other kinds of human activity. Design as a science The design-science relationship continues to be debatedFarrell, R. and C. Hooker (2012) 'The Simon‚ÄîKroes model of technical artifacts and the distinction between science and design', Design Studies, 33 (5) pp. 480-495 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.destud.2012.05.001Galle, P. and P. Kroes (2014) 'Science and design. Identical twins?' Design Studies, 35 (3) pp. 201-231 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.destud.2013.12.002 and there continue to be many efforts to reframe or reform design as science. For example, the axiomatic theory of design by Suh presents a domain independent theory that can explain or prescribe the design process. The Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) ontology by Gero, presenting a domain independent ontology of design and designing, is another example. Early efforts that use mathematics to formalize the design process include Braha's formal theory of design (FDT), which is a domain independent mathematical and computational theory of the design process.Braha, Dan; Maimon, Oded (1998). A Mathematical Theory of Design: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications. Springer. Design as a science in information systems There has been a particular emphasis on design as a science within information systems. Hevner and Chatterjee provide a reference on design science research (DSR) in Information Systems, including a selection of papers from the DESRIST conferences, a look at key principles of DSR, and the integration of action research with design research. Vaishnavi, Kuechler, and Petter offer a resource on design science research in information systems that outlines the origins and philosophical grounding for design science research, explains the design science methodology, and offers a bibliography of articles that discuss design science methods or offer exemplars of design science.Vaishnavi, V., Kuechler, W., and Petter, S. (2004/19). \\"Design Science Research in Information Systems\\" January 20, 2004; last updated June 30, 2019. URL: http://desrist.org/design-research-in-information-systems In 2010, 122 professors promoted design science in information system research by signing a memorandum.http://memo.iwi.unisg.ch/en/ Hevner et al. provide a set of seven guidelines which help information systems researchers conduct, evaluate and present design-science research. The seven guidelines address design as an artifact, problem relevance, design evaluation, research contributions, research rigor, design as a search process, and research communication. Later extensions of the design science research approach detail how design and research problems can be rationally decomposed by means of nested problem solving. It is also explained how the regulative cycle (problem investigation, solution design, design validation, solution implementation, and implementation evaluation) fits in the framework. Peffers et al. developed a model for producing and presenting information systems research that they called the design science research process. The Peffers et al. model has been used extensively and Adams provides an example of the process model being applied to create a digital forensic process model.

Forward Control models =Design= The distinctive cab design, which sets it apart from other British commercial vehicles, was a forward-control (or semi-forward control) design and the Thames Trader model covered a much wider weight range than the existing normal control ET Thames model or the earlier forward control 7V model. Both these earlier models had been based on Ford of America designs; the new Thames Trader was the first heavy commercial to be designed by Ford of Britain (although looking at the headlight surrounds suggests a family resemblance to the American Ford C series truck of the mid 1950s). =Mechanicals and wheelbase types= The Thames Trader model range covered weights from 2 to 7 tons, powered by either petrol or diesel engines in four- or six-cylinder guises. The lower-weight vehicles were available with 118- and 138-inch wheelbases, the heavy weight vehicle with 138-, 152- and 160-inch wheelbases; there was also a 108-inch tipper wheelbase. In addition there was a low-frame chassis model ‚Äì typically used for furniture van bodywork. =Mk2= A Mk 2 version was introduced in mid-1962. Externally it is very easy to differentiate between Mk1 and Mk2 versions; the Mk1 has the words THAMES TRADER in red on a chrome strip along the bottom of the bonnet opening and the white painted grill between the headlights has a vertical divider with a red circular badge with 4 stars, whereas the Mk2 has just the word THAMES under the bonnet, and TRADER in white letters spaced out between the headlights replacing the divider and badge. The Mk2 Diesel engined variants had either a 4D or 6D chrome badge on each front wing, on the Mk1 it was a squarish chrome badge with either a red painted 4, 6, 4D or 6D to indicate the engine configuration. The lower edge of the badge had a horizontal chrome strip running the length of the lower part of the wing.

These had a lower deck purpose built for carrying bicycles, with the upper deck for cyclists. Unusually, these buses had their stairwell several feet above the level of the road, accessible by a ladder. The service was later dropped in 1965, owing to lack of cycle traffic and possibly the design.

The hurricane developed in the western Caribbean Sea on September 1, and tracked northeastward. After crossing Cuba, the hurricane rapidly strengthened in the eastern Gulf of Mexico to reach peak winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). Easy executed a cyclonic loop, moved northeastward to hit near Cedar Key, Florida, executed a second loop, and hit western Florida again. After rapidly weakening over Florida, the hurricane turned to the northwest, and ultimately dissipated over northeastern Arkansas on September 9. From the point when Hurricane Easy entered the Gulf of Mexico until it weakened to a tropical storm, it was observed nearly constantly from radars or Reconnaissance Aircraft. Easy is the most recent major hurricane to strike the Homosassa, Florida, area. Due to the hurricane remaining near the northwest Florida coast for an extended period of time, Easy produced severe rainfall and strong waves, resulting in heavy damage in the Cedar Key area. Hurricane Easy was one of two major hurricanes to strike Florida during the year; the other was Hurricane King which affected Miami.  Meteorological history  Following the passage of Hurricane Baker through the Caribbean Sea, a trough of low pressure persisted across the western Caribbean Sea. On August 31, convection became more concentrated to the south of the Isle of Youth, and on September 1 the disturbance developed into a tropical storm; it was later given the name \\"Easy\\", as part of the United States Weather Bureau naming tropical cyclones with the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. A developing anticyclone and moist air over the region provided favorable conditions for intensification, as the storm tracked slowly northeastward. On September 2, Tropical Storm Easy attained hurricane status about 50 miles (85 km) south of the Isle of Youth. After crossing the Isle of Youth, Hurricane Easy strengthened slightly while continuing northeastward, and the storm struck the Matanzas Province of Cuba with winds of . The hurricane quickly crossed the island, passing just east of Havana before reaching the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on September 3\\\\. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Easy turned to the north-northwest, paralleling the Florida coastline a short distance offshore while producing hurricane force winds onshore. On September 4, the hurricane quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of , an intensity it would retain for 18 hours. That day, a ridge of high pressure strengthened to the north of the storm, leaving weaker steering currents. This caused Hurricane Easy to execute a counter-clockwise loop to the west of Tampa, Florida. After executing its first loop, Hurricane Easy moved northeastward at until making landfall near Cedar Key on September 5 with winds of . Steering currents again became weak, causing Easy to execute a second loop in 24 hours towards the southeast. After briefly emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane made its final landfall on Homosassa Springs to the north of Tampa, and rapidly weakened to a tropical storm over land. Easy turned to the northeast, which was followed by a turn to the northwest as the storm neared the Atlantic coast. On September 7, Easy crossed into Georgia, and shortly thereafter it weakened to a tropical depression. The depression continued northwestward for two days until dissipating over extreme northeastern Arkansas on September 9\\\\. The reason for its erratic track, including the two loops, is unknown, although it is potentially due to a Fujiwhara interaction with Hurricane Dog to its east.  Preparations and impact  Easy's Rainfall across the United States The hurricane crossed over western Cuba with winds of up to ; however, damage was minor, and no deaths occurred in the country. In Havana, winds decreased to as the eye of the hurricane crossed over the city. With an eye ranging from to in diameter, the hurricane was well-tracked throughout its lifetime by radars at the University of Florida and by Reconnaissance Aircraft. Despite its unusual track, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings in a timely manner, though warnings were issued for a larger area than those that actually experienced hurricane force winds. In the Florida Keys, winds from Easy reached , which downed trees and power lines, littering local streets with debris.Barnes, p. 187 Heavy seas moved around a Navy barge, though no damage was reported. Hurricane Easy produced hurricane force winds across large portions of western Florida, including over winds in Cedar Key for 9 and 1/2 hours. The town, which reported a minimum pressure of 958.3 mbar (28.30 in), experienced the eye of the hurricane for 2 and 1/2 hours while strong waves hit the coast. The tide in Tampa Bay rose , the highest since 1921. While looping twice along its path, the hurricane dropped heavy amounts of rainfall of to in large portions of northwestern Florida. Rainfall totals include in Cedar Key in 3 days and in Yankeetown, Florida, in 24 hours, which easily became the largest 24‚Äëhour rainfall total on record for the United States. The record has since been broken by Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979 with , though Easy's total remains the largest 24‚Äëhour rainfall total on record for the state of Florida. Hurricane Easy was described as the worst hurricane in the Cedar Key area in 70 years. The hurricane left half of the houses destroyed or unfit for rehabilitation, while 90% of the others were damaged. The strong winds destroyed the roofs of 150 homes and buildings. The rainfall caused severe flooding that resulted in crop damage. Easy was indirectly responsible for two deaths due to electrocutions. In addition, 27 people were injured from the hurricane. The strong waves destroyed the fishing community's entire fishing fleet of 100 boats, which was the town's entire livelihood. The town's main employment center, a broom and brush plant, was severely damaged, and would close two years after the hurricane. The hurricane also produced severe damage in Pinellas and Hillsborough Counties in the Tampa area. Throughout Florida, damages totaled $3.3 million (1950 USD), a lower than expected total due to the sparse population in the area of the worst damage. After the storm's passage throughout central and northern Florida, \\"blisters\\" developed on hundreds of cars; the locations affected reported that the blisters formed on the surface of vehicles shortly after Easy retreated. The following day, the blisters disappeared. Researchers later created several theories as to the unusual occurrence, though they concluded that air pockets under the layer of paint expanded as a result of the decreased barometric pressure.Barnes, p. 190 Heavy rainfall from Hurricane Easy continued into Georgia and occurred throughout the state. The precipitation was most intense and destructive along Georgia's coast, damaging crops and vegetation after waterlogging fields. In some areas, 5‚Äì9 in (125‚Äì225 mm) of rain was recorded in a single day.

Early life and career Stone was born in New York City, the son of Lily (Abbey) and Alfred Stone, who was born in Belgium. His family was Jewish. He moved to Florida and attended public schools in Dade County. Stone graduated cum laude with a B.A. from Harvard University in 1949 and received a LL.B. from Columbia Law School in 1954. He returned to Florida and was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1955, practicing in Miami. In 1966, Stone became Miami City Attorney and was elected to the Florida Senate in 1967, representing Dade County. In 1970, he was elected Secretary of State of Florida. He resigned in July 1974, before his term ended, to focus on his campaign for the U.S. Senate. Senate In 1974, Stone ran in an 11-candidate Democratic primary election. Congressman Bill Gunter finished first but Stone won a close subsequent runoff, 51% to 49%. On the Republican side, incumbent Senator Edward Gurney chose not to run for reelection after being indicted for taking bribes in return for his influence with the Federal Housing Administration. Millionaire Eckerd drug store chain owner, Jack Eckerd, defeated Paula Hawkins for the Republican nomination. In the general election, Stone narrowly defeated Eckerd in a race that saw the American Party candidate, John Grady, claim nearly 16% of the vote. Stone was the second Jewish U.S. Senator from Florida (after David Levy Yulee) and the first since the U.S. Civil War.https://www.jta.org/quick-reads/richard-stone-floridas- first-jewish-senator-since-civil-war-dies-at-90 Outgoing Senator Gurney resigned on December 31, 1974 and Stone was officially appointed senator by Governor Reubin Askew on January 1, 1975, two days before his term was scheduled to begin. During Stone's term in the U.S. Senate, he was a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and was a strong advocate for the Panama Canal Torrijos‚ÄìCarter Treaties. He also voted for neutron bomb funding, deregulation of natural gas, and public funding of congressional campaigns, and voted against an early version of the Kemp‚ÄìRoth Tax Cut and funding medically necessary abortions. He led efforts to secure congressional aid for Israel and also served as an important advisor during the 1978 Camp David Peace Treaty. In addition to the Foreign Relations Committee, Stone served on the Agriculture Committee. At the onset of his term, Stone was one of three Jewish members of the U.S. Senate along with Jacob Javits and Abraham Ribicoff. Reelection bid With a reputation for changing his mind and with the AFL- CIO actively campaigning against him, Stone was deemed vulnerable in his reelection bid. Six Democrats entered the race for Stone's seat including his 1974 runoff opponent Bill Gunter who was Florida State Treasurer/Insurance Commissioner in 1980. As was the case in 1974, Stone and Gunter were forced into a runoff but, unlike 1974, Gunter won the nomination in 1980. (Gunter was defeated by Paula Hawkins in the general election). Stone resigned three days early on December 31, 1980. Post-senate Senator Stone was included on president-elect Reagan's transition team the day after the 1980 elections. From 1981 to 1982, he was senior resident partner at the law firm of Proskauer, Rose, Goetz & Mendelsohn in Washington, D.C. During that time, the Spanish-speaking Stone worked as a paid lobbyist for the right-wing Guatemalan government of Fernando Romeo Lucas Garc√≠a. On January 19, 1982, Stone was named as Vice Chairman of the President's Commission for Radio Broadcasting to Cuba. He was also vice chairman of the board of Capital Bank of Washington. In February 1983, Stone served in the Department of State as Special Representative of the President for Public Diplomacy in Central America. On April 28, 1983, President Reagan announced Stone's appointment as Ambassador at Large and Special Envoy to Central America. Despite concerns over his recent ties with the oppressive right-wing Guatemalan government and how he would be perceived by the leftist FMLN of El Salvador, Stone was confirmed and commenced the position on May 26.Ambassadors at Large from 1949 to 2005 at United States Department of State. Retrieved on 2007-02-09. Stone was once a paid lobbyist for the conservative Guatemalan government of Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia. This made Democrats argue that he was ill-suited to be President Reagan's appointee to be Ambassador at Large for Central America, a role that required negotiation with the leftist government of El Salvador and other administrations. He resigned effective March 1, 1984, allegedly after experiencing personality conflicts with Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Langhorne A. Motley.

General Eiling made his live appearance on the first season of The Flash played by Clancy Brown.  Publication history  Wade Eiling first appeared in Captain Atom #1 (March 1987) and was created by Cary Bates and Pat Broderick.  Fictional character biography  = Captain Atom = Wade Eiling is a military tactician who blackmails the accused Nathaniel Adam into participating in the atomic experiment that turns Nathaniel into the nuclear being Captain Atom, and causes Adam to disappear for 18 years. This is considered a failure by Eiling and Heinrich Megala, the project's main scientist. They would attempt the experiment again, which ends up with the creation of Major Force. During the 18 years in which Adam is gone, Eiling marries Adam's wife and acts as father to his two children. Eiling also manipulates Captain Atom into serving the military. His first attempts, a chance for Adam to view his children in exchange for retrieving a lost submarine, falls apart in issue #3 of the 1980s Captain Atom series. This embarrasses Eiling in front of his superiors. The same issue details the cover story for Captain Atom that Eiling helps create, one that is, in his words, \\"a scenario just far-fetched and hokey enough to sound authentic\\". His continuing conflicts with the title character were a major focus of the 1980s Captain Atom series. Eiling would also form an intensely adversarial relationship with Megala. = Hacker Files = General Wade Eiling makes a cameo appearance in SoftWar, the very first story arc of 1993 maxi-series The Hacker Files. = JLA = In JLA #24 after being diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor, Eiling sends a military team to salvage the indestructible body of the second Shaggy Man from the Pacific Ocean where he has its body shaved. Green Lantern and Aquaman attempt to stop the Corps from retrieving the body, but their efforts are thwarted.JLA #24 The General returns to his base of operations, Threshold. From there he orchestrates a military assault on the JLA. Answering a call for help in Phoenix, Arizona, the Justice League are attacked by American military forces. Spearheading the offensive is a new superhero team called the Ultramarine Corps. Recruited and genetically enhanced by Eiling's lab team, The Ultramarines already exhibit signs of terminal illness. Meanwhile, Batman, the Huntress and Plastic Man track Eiling to Threshold, where they discover that the General transferred his brain patterns into the indestructible body of the Shaggy Man. The JLA battle the military and the Corps until JLA #26 (Feb. 1999). Eiling's forces consider mutiny as doubts against attacking the League come to a head. Superman, whose super-senses have diagnosed the Ultramarine's disease, persuades the Ultramarine Corps that Eiling has used and betrayed them. The Corps members, who volunteered for service in good faith, switch sides and speed with the JLA toward Threshold.JLA #26 Even against the combined might of the JLA and the Ultramarines, the General is unstoppable. Batman notices that Eiling's tactical edge and focus are diminished in his new artificial form. Working together, the team fights the monster onto a bulk-matter teleport platform. Eiling is transported to 433 Eros, a 'rocky needle', six miles in length, at the heart of the Sol system's asteroid belt. = The Injustice Gang = He stays there for several months until Queen Bee recruits him into Lex Luthor's new Injustice Gang. Eiling battles against the Justice League a second time as part of a coordinated attack, this time utilizing a large-scale machine gun. He declares that the League was wrong to banish him to the asteroid with no trial. The battle moves to one of the White Martian warships that is currently inside the Phantom Zone. There, Eiling states his plan to utilize the weapons of mass destruction on Earth itself. Orion's war dog Sturmer participates in a trick against Eiling. The canine tackles the man through a ship's airlock, into the Phantom Zone. This naturally distresses Superman but Orion assures him that Sturmer has willingly made this choice.JLA Vol. 6: World War III (collects JLA #34-41, 2000, ) = Back as a threat = Having somehow escaped, he has since appeared in the JSA comics fighting Hal Jordan.

This effort fails. Later, he is recruited into the Suicide Squad, where his regenerative powers are significantly diminished. He betrays the team to their intended target. Rick Flag detonates a bomb implanted in Eiling's head, ending the threat. His head and brain eventually regenerate, but results in some amnesia. Eiling continues to serve as a Squad member through Salvation Run. This is the name for a program that exiles supervillains to a distant, Earth-like planet without a trial.Salvation Run #1 = The New 52 = In September 2011, DC Comics engaged in a line-wide revision of its superhero comics, including their stories and characters' fictional histories, known as The New 52.

Introduced in \\"Dark Heart\\", he is a USAF General and a member of Project Cadmus who regards metahumans as a threat to humanity. After the Atom shut down the Dark Heart, Eiling and his soldiers confiscated the device. In \\"The Doomsday Sanction\\", he sent a nuclear warhead to kill Doomsday regardless of innocent casualties and compelled Captain Atom to choose between the USAF or the Justice League. When Batman confronts Project Cadmus' leader Amanda Waller, Eiling attempted and failed to defeat him. Following Project Cadmus' disbandment, Eiling was relegated to a \\"pencil pusher\\". In the episode \\"Patriot Act\\", a displeased Eiling injected himself with Captain Nazi's super- soldier serum and transformed into a monster. He attempts to find Superman, but chooses to fight non-powered Leaguers Green Arrow, Speedy, Shining Knight, Crimson Avenger, Vigilante, Stargirl, and S.T.R.I.P.E. instead. While he soundly defeated the group, a group of civilians stood between him and Shining Knight, at which point Eiling realized he was the only metahuman involved in the fight. Upon leaving, he vowedg to return if the Justice League becomes a threat.  He also appears in issue #5 of spin-off comic of the same name. * General Wade Eiling appears in the Young Justice animated series, voiced by Jeff Bennett. In the episode \\"Failsafe\\", a mind-training exercise conducted by Martian Manhunter features Eiling leading the U.S. Army in defending Washington D.C. from an alien invasion.

Introduced in the episode \\"Plastique\\", Eiling leads a task force to capture Bette Sans Souci for her abilities, only to shoot her after he attacks him. Eiling returns in the episodes \\"The Nuclear Man\\" and \\"Fallout\\" to harness Firestorm's abilities, but is abducted by Eobard Thawne and Grodd. In the episode \\"Grodd Lives\\", the titular gorilla uses his psionic powers to brainwash Eiling and force him to rob armored cars until the latter is captured by Team Flash and remanded to the S.T.A.R. Labs' pipeline until Grodd is defeated. * A similar villain named General Wade appears in the fifth season of Gotham, portrayed by John Bedford Lloyd. General Wade first comes to Gotham City in the episode \\"I Am Bane\\", where he leads the U.S. Army in their mission to restore order after the No Man's Land event. However, General Wade is then captured by Bane and taken to the laboratory of Hugo Strange, where the Professor corrupts the General by planting a mind-control device in his brain.

It has a population of around 1,350. History The name derives from the Norse for \\"gully village\\".Maclean, R. (nd) Gaelic and Norse in the Landscape: Place names in Caithness and Sutherland, Scottish Natural Heritage, =Planned village= During a series of visits from the Right Honourable Elizabeth Countess of Sutherland plans were drawn up for the regulations that were written in to future leases, imposing restrictions on the 'tacksmen' with regard to sub- setting and overstocking, and requiring them to adopt improving farming techniques. Consideration was also given to possible development of fishing villages on the east coast, the absence of any safe harbour being the greatest hindrance. Local fishermen used only small, light boats which could be drawn up onto the beach when not in use and this confined them to line fishing close to the shore. The herring fishing in the North Sea (at that time known as the German Ocean) was in the hands of the Dutch, who had a good fleet of decked vessels - the 'Holland Busses' - and it was hoped that some means could be found of developing a similar trade for the benefit of the people of Sutherland. In one visit (between July and August 1805) the first plans were laid for Golspie village. It was to be based on \\"the street of the Fishertown of Golspie\\" and was to consist of houses , each with a croft of . The people were to get a 99-year lease for their houses, which they were to build themselves, but the croft ground was to be re-let annually, thus permitting changes in the layout of the village from time to time. In addition to the individual crofts, it was intended to provide common cow pasture. One improvement was quickly made and that was the building of a little pier or jetty to provide a safe landing place for boats serving Dunrobin. In a letter to her husband the Countess described how she had caused intimation to be given at the Church door that forty men were wanted for the next week at the rate of 1/- a day, to build this jetty, using stones from the beach. The work was supervised by William Pope, who was being considered as a possible person to take charge of the proposed development of the harbours at Culgour and Helmsdale. In April 1805 the Colonel Campbell submitted for Presbytery's approval a plan for a new schoolhouse in Golspie, the old one having been classed as ruinous the previous year. The plan for the new one was as follows: the school was to be in length, a kitchen and the master's room ; the width all through to be ; the side walls high, a roof of grey slate and to be furnished with windows, locks and doors, desks and seats, the total cost being ¬£127:12/-. Golspie town centre Looking over the beaches to Golspie Dunrobin Castle Centred on Loch Fleet, south of Golspie, is a national nature reserve with wading birds, wildfowl and seals. Osprey, terns and swallows frequent the loch in summer. Rare wild flowers and plants can be seen in nearby Balblair Wood. There are four hotels, several guesthouses and bed and breakfast premises as well as self-catering cottages. Dunrobin Castle, the seat of Clan Sutherland, is nearby and has falconry displays. There is a static caravan site. The Old Bank Road drill hall was completed in 1892. Culture Golspie hosted the National M√≤d in 1977 and 1995.List of Mod's places for each year on Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig website The village has a Choral Group, Rotary Club, and dancing classes. At the start of August Golspie Gala Week is held. Among the 100 events staged throughout the week are a car-banger derby, a fancy dress parade, a wheelbarrow race and a parade of massed pipe bands as a finale. Golspie Heritage Society has a permanent home in the former Fisherman's Welcome on Station Road. The IT-equipped public library, open for limited periods four days weekly, is in the Community Centre complex adjoining the High School. Hospital There is a small hospital, The Lawson Memorial hospital, located just off the main road to the south of the centre of the village. Among other services, the hospital provides a pain clinic and offers pain intervention procedures as part of the Chronic Pain Management Service for the whole of the northern Highland Region. Religion The Church of Scotland and the Free Church of Scotland have well-established congregations, but the Roman Catholic Church and Scottish Episcopal Church worship in nearby Brora. The parish church is officially St Andrew's Church, and contains the town graveyard. Transport Golspie railway station, on the Far North Line, opened in 1874. The converted station building is now a holiday let. Buses operate about every two hours Mondays-Saturdays and infrequently on Sundays from Golspie to Dornoch, Tain and Inverness in the south and Brora, Helmsdale, Berriedale, Dunbeath, Halkirk, Thurso and Scrabster in the north. These are on route X99 and are operated by Stagecoach in the Highlands, but tickets can be bought on the Citylink website. Sport Golspie has award-winning safe bathing beaches to the north and south of the tidal pier and there is also a public swimming pool in the centre of the village. The Kart Race Track is a mile or two down Ferry Road. The golf course has a mix of links, parkland and heath and there are central facilities for tennis and bowling, football and playing fields. Around Golspie there are opportunities for walking, bird watching and botany study, fossil-hunting and gorges and waterfalls. There is loch and sea angling, as well as sailing and yachting in the bay. In 2006 mountain bike trails were opened on the slopes of Beinn Bhragaidh. The village's local football team, Golspie Sutherland currently plays in the North Caledonian Football Association, and is the joint most successful team in the league.

Soup beans are usually served with cornbread, greens (such as boiled cabbage, cauliflower, or sauerkraut and sausage), and potatoes (stewed or fried) and may be topped with raw chopped onions or ramps (Allium tricoccum). Soup beans are considered a main course, but also serve as a side dish. In rural areas, where food was scarce during the winter, these dried beans were a staple food.1 ^ Sohn, Mark F. Appalachian Home Cooking History, Culture, & Recipes Lexington: University Press of Kentucky. 2005.  Types of soup beans  While soup beans are traditionally pinto beans (called brown beans in the mountain region), other types of beans are also used. *White beans ‚Äî Great northern beans and Navy beans are often used to make a soup bean dish. This became more common as residents of rural areas began to rely more on store-bought beans and could afford more variety. This dish is typically referred to as \\"white beans\\" although it is occasionally called soup beans. Along with the beans, white beans are typically cooked in the juice of a country ham, often with the ham bone or ham included in the dish. As such, this dish is a prized part of holiday meals, when hams are baked. White beans are sometimes cooked with pork fat like brown soup beans, although this is less common. White beans carried an air of sophistication because they were first available in towns to people who could afford more than one type of bean and ham, as opposed to poorer rural people who often raised only brown beans. *Butter beans ‚Äî butter beans are used to make the soup bean dish called butter beans. These dried limas are cooked with smoked pork and/or ham until the sauce starts to thicken, hence the name \\"butter\\" beans. Like white beans, butter beans represented prosperity and were often prized dishes when served. Butter beans only refers to dried limas. Fresh or canned limas are called \\"lima beans\\". *Black-eyed peas ‚Äî While these peas are almost never referred to as \\"soup beans\\", the preparation in the Appalachian region is almost identical. Black-eyed peas, sometimes called blackeye peas, are most common where Appalachian culture intersects with lowland soul-food and coastal food cultures. Like Hoppin' John, black-eyed peas became common as a dish served on New Year's Day. However, since rice was not a part of mountain culture, the peas were cooked with pork (usually hog jowls) like soup beans and served with stewed tomatoes and collard greens. This dish becomes less common as one moves into more isolated mountain communities.  Service  While soup beans might be served with any meal, they were typically the main course in a meatless supper. Traditionally, soup beans would be served with other home grown vegetables and homemade breads: *Corn bread ‚Äî Prior to the availability of milled flour, thin, crispy fried yellow cornbread cakes called hoecakes or baked cornbread are sometimes served with a soup-bean supper. Often the beans are served atop a bed of crumbled cornbread, or cornbread may be crumbled into a bowl of beans, almost like adding crackers to chili. *Potatoes ‚Äî Irish white potatoes were typically served, especially during the winter months, boiled, mashed or fried (boiled then pan fried). In lowland areas, sweet potatoes are commonly served. *Greens ‚Äî Most commonly collard or turnip greens in the cold-weather months, prepared by slow cooking the greens with smoked pork or bacon grease. In the spring- time, kilt greens are available for preparation and service. Kil't greens are made by boiling tender garden lettuces and the nascent leaves of wild local plants, dressed with a hot bacon and onion vinaigrette, and served hot. *Ramps or onions ‚Äî Strong native onions called ramps were often served raw. They were often cut up onto the beans as seasonings other than salt and local herbs were not consistently available.https://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/ncnu02/v5-449.html Ramps are sometimes replaced by cultivated onions. *Chow-chow - a relish-like condiment similar to British piccalilli, chow chow could be preserved and served with beans year-round. Modern additions: Modern supermarkets and processed foods have led to two additions to soup bean suppers which are not traditional. *Salmon croquettes ‚Äî The availability of canned salmon led to salmon croquettes or salmon patties being included with soup beans. The tastes are complementary and salmon, like any purchased meat, would be considered a luxury and not cooked in large quantities. *Sauerkraut and sausage (also known as sauerkraut and weenieshttp://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/franks_and_sauerkraut_paprikash/ or mountain choucroute garnieChoucroute garnie) ‚Äî Frankfurters and/or smoked sausage are sliced and pan-fried with sauerkraut for this common soup bean dinner dish. *Macaroni and tomatoes ‚Äî Macaroni and tomatoes is a common mountain-region side dish. Although there are many variations, the dish typically consists of cooked macaroni and canned tomatoes. *Macaroni and cheese ‚Äî In the latter part of the 20th century, supermarkets in mountain towns made processed cheese and pasta available, as well as boxed dinners. Macaroni and cheese was inexpensive and easy to add to a soup bean meal.

WCWM is owned and operated by the College of William & Mary. History The first known radio activities at William & Mary occurred in the spring of 1956, when a group of students, using equipment purchased in their own financial initiative, broadcast a weak signal from the Chapman House. Although many students and some faculty were behind the effort, this early initiative failed due to lack of administrative backing, according to a letter to the editor by former WCWM Program Director Fred Schaffer (class of 1957) that was published in the Flat Hat, the William & Mary newspaper, on March 10, 1959. WCWM officially began operations in September, 1959, after two years of political process aimed at procuring funding and administrative approval, and another year to complete construction and obtain a broadcast license from the Federal Communications Commission. The station was originally licensed to operate at 89.1 megahertz with an effective radiated power of ten watts. The original operating schedule was daily from 4:55pm to 10:30pm. Programming featured news and mostly classical music. WCWM has historically relied on a steady supply of student volunteers. During 1975 and 1976, WCWM upgraded its studios and transmitter to stereophonic operation and increased its effective radiated power to 1,600 watts, according to former student John Keimig (class of 1978), who worked in the station's engineering department during that time. The whole process of procuring and installing facility equipment and submitting the necessary applications to the Federal Communications Commission was handled by student volunteers who then held leadership positions at the station. The college provided funding and administrative support. Programming in those years typically ran from 7:00am to 3:00am, with continuous operation when volunteer staff were available to fill the \\"graveyard\\" shift. The station's frequency changed from 89.1 MHz to 90.7 MHz before the 1985‚Äì86 academic year. Since then, the station has grown to a 13,500 watt signal and the frequency changed once again from 90.7 MHz to 90.9 MHz. The station continues to draw a majority of its talent and personnel from the William & Mary student body. In 2012, WCWM hosted the first music festival at the College of William & Mary, WCWM Fest, featuring The Walkmen and The Mountain Goats as headliners. Subsequent WCWM Fests have featured headliners such as Frankie Cosmos, Remember Sports, Half Waif, Vagabon, and Lucy Dacus.

He commanded the 21st Panzer Division from May 1941 until being made a prisoner of war in late November 1941. He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross of Nazi Germany. A professional soldier on the outbreak of World War I, Ravenstein fought as an infantry officer on the Western Front. Awarded the Pour le M√©rite in 1918, he participated in the border disputes with Poland after the war before leaving the military. After attending university, he obtained employment with an electrical company and then later with the Duisburg city administration. In 1934, he joined the Heer (Army) branch of the Wehrmacht. He led a rifle regiment in the Invasion of Poland and the Battle of France. In May 1941, he was appointed commander of the 5th Light Division, at the time operating in North Africa. His command was soon redesignated as the 21st Panzer Division. He was captured by soldiers from the 2nd New Zealand Division during the British Eighth Army's Operation Crusader. The first German general to be captured by Allied forces during World War II, Ravenstein was held in a series of prisoner of war camps in Egypt, South Africa, Canada and lastly in Wales. Repatriated to Germany in 1947, he found employment with the D√ºsseldorf Corporation before returning to Duisburg to again work for the city's administration. He died of a heart attack in 1962 at the age of 73. Early life Johann Theodor von Ravenstein was born in Strehlen, near Breslau, on 1 January 1889 into a family with a military tradition. His father was an officer in the Silesian Hussars and an ancestor was an adjutant to Generalfeldmarschall Bl√ºcher during the Napoleonic Wars. He had a harsh upbringing; his father had a major head injury while Johann was young and this affected his interactions with his children. Eventually his mother left his father, later obtaining a divorce in 1893, and raised Ravenstein and his sister on her own. Despite an early interest in becoming a pastor in the Lutheran Church, Ravenstein began a military education in 1899 when he entered Wahlstatt Cadet School. He went onto the Cadet Academy in Berlin in 1903. During his time there, he made the acquaintance of Kaiser Wilhelm II while occasionally serving as a page at the Neues Palais (New Palace) at Potsdam. Following graduation from the Cadet Academy in 1909 he was posted to the King's Grenadier Regiment, stationed at Liegnitz, as a leutnant (second lieutenant). The same year he met his future wife, Elisabeth von Oriola, who was from an aristocratic Silesian family of Portuguese descent. World War I After two years at Liegnitz, Ravenstein transferred to the 155th Infantry Regiment as a battalion adjutant officer. On the outbreak of World War I, his regiment marched into Belgium and he fought in the Battle of Longwy on 22 August 1914. He subsequently saw action in the Battle of Verdun. In 1915 he was promoted to oberleutnant and was soon commanding a company in his regiment. Apart for periods of leave, he served continuously on the Western Front throughout the war. He proposed to Elisabeth in 1917 and married her early the following year while on leave. Ravenstein was selected for a training course in general staff duties and, after completion, joined the General Staff of the Imperial German Army. He soon sought a return to the frontlines and rejoined the 155th Infantry Regiment which was to soon be involved in the third phase of the Spring Offensive. In the Third Battle of the Aisne in May 1918, Ravenstein was given command of his regiment's 1st Battalion and led it through the opposing line. Shortly afterwards, with only a small squad of men, he captured a bridge over the Aisne near Chemin des Dames. Later in the battle, he was in charge of a patrol which executed an ambush of a French battalion, routing it completely. Pushing on with his battalion towards the Marne, his troops eventually took 1,500 prisoners and captured in excess of 30 field guns and machine guns. For his accomplishments, Ravenstein received the Pour le M√©rite on 9 June. Promoted to hauptmann (captain), Ravenstein was posted to the Imperial Guard as a battalion commander. He was serving at the Kaiser's headquarters when the war ended. Attached to the Freikorps from 1919, he was engaged in defending against Polish incursions along the border in the east of Germany. When the border disputes settled, he decided to leave the military rather than stay in the newly formed Reichsheer. He was discharged on 31 March 1920 having received an honorary promotion to the rank of major. Interwar period Entering a university at Essen, he graduated in 1921 with a degree in administration. He secured employment with a large electrical company and was soon transferred to Duisburg. He made the acquaintance of the city's mayor, Dr. Karl Jarres, who, in 1926, offered him a role as the manager of the Duisburg tramway system. He was a success in the role and Jarres soon moved Ravenstein to his mayoral office as director of public relations. By this stage of his career, he had adopted his sister's daughter. Ravenstein lost his job when Jarres lost his mayoralty in 1933. As an anti-Nazi, he found it hard to secure employment so in 1934 he rejoined the army as a major attached to the 2nd Battalion of the 60th Infantry Regiment. On 1 October 1936 he was promoted to oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) and shortly afterwards was given command of the 4th Rifle Regiment, 1st Light Division, based at Iserlohn. He led the regiment when it was involved in the occupation of Sudetenland, having been promoted oberst (colonel) in August 1938. The following year the regiment was part of the occupation force that marched into Czechoslovakia. World War II The 1st Light Division was involved in the Polish campaign as part of the 10th Army. After the end of the fighting in Poland, the division's structure was considered inadequate and it was re-organised as the 6th Panzer Division. Ravenstein remained in command of his regiment and led it through the Battle of France. At one stage, having crossed the Meuse and Oise Rivers and accompanied by several panzers, his regiment captured the headquarters of the French 9th Army although its commander, General Henri Giraud, was away at the front at the time. As a result of his regiment's endeavours, Ravenstein was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. The campaign in France concluded, Ravenstein was appointed commander of 16th Rifle Brigade, 16th Panzer Division, and was sent to the Balkans. During his time there he was briefly part of the German Military Mission to Romania and later, after the Battle of Greece, was a liaison officer at the court of King Boris III of Bulgaria. On 20 May 1941, he was promoted to generalmajor and appointed commander of the 5th Light Division, which was serving in Libya as part of Generalleutnant Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps. =North Africa= Ravenstein arrived in North Africa a few days later to take up command of the 5th Light Division and was almost immediately brought into action when the British commenced Operation Battleaxe. Ordered by Rommel to attack the flank of the British advance, his division performed well, inflicting severe damage to the 7th Armoured Brigade, and threatening encirclement of the 7th Armoured Division and the Indian 4th Infantry Division. After the battle, Ravenstein's division was redesignated the 21st Panzer Division although it did not receive any additional units to its order of battle. For the next few months, the Afrika Korps built up its stores in preparation for offensive operations against Tobruk and during this period Ravenstein went on leave to Rome. Ravenstein, on the right, after his capture by soldiers of New Zealand's 21st Battalion, with a British staff officer at Tobruk, Libya In the evening of 18 November 1941, the British Eighth Army commenced Operation Crusader, intended to relieve the Siege of Tobruk. Ravenstein's division, located to the west of Bardia, was soon engaged in counterattacks during which his command vehicle was struck by gunfire. By 26 November his command was reduced to 22 tanks. While traveling in a staff car on 28 November 1941 to visit the headquarters of the neighbouring 15th Panzer Division with an orderly and driver, Ravenstein was ambushed by soldiers of 21st Battalion, 2nd New Zealand Division, near Point 175. One of his companions was wounded when the New Zealanders opened fire and the trio surrendered. Taken back to battalion headquarters, it was discovered that one of their captives was a general. Ravenstein was promptly taken into Tobruk and maps he was carrying were helpful in preparing against forthcoming attacks by the 21st Panzer Division. He was the first German general to be made a prisoner of war by Allied forces in the war. =Prisoner of War= Ravenstein was transported by ship from Tobruk but it was sunk by an Italian torpedo bomber and was rescued by a British corvette after spending two hours in the sea. Taken to Alexandria, he was held in a series of prisoner of war camps, firstly in Egypt, then South Africa and later in Ontario, where he spent the majority of the war. While a POW, he was promoted to generalleutnant on 1 October 1943. After the war, he was transferred to a POW camp in Bridgend, Wales, which was designated for senior German officers. He soon developed heart problems and was medically repatriated to Germany in November 1947. Later life Settling back in Iserlohn with his wife Elisabeth, Ravenstein secured a job with the D√ºsseldorf Corporation. In 1951, he and his wife moved to Duisburg, where he took up employment again with the city's administration. He eventually retired in 1954. Soon afterwards he declined an offer from King Farouk of Egypt to command his country's army. An active Christian throughout his life, he was involved in the Lutheran Church in addition to other civic and charitable organisations. While attending church in Duisburg, he died on 26 March 1962 of a heart attack. Notes Footnotes Citations References  Further reading * External links * .

Blenda led the rural women of V√§rend in an attack on a pillaging Danish army and annihilated the invaders. Legend According to the legend, the events took place in the time of Alle (Anglo- Saxon √Ülla), King of the Geats, when this king led the Geats in an attack against Norway. King Alle had marshalled not only the West Geats, but also the South Geats (or Riding Geats) of Sm√•land, and so many men had left for Norway that the region was virtually defenseless. When the Danes learned of Sm√•land's precarious situation, they took advantage of it and attacked the defenseless small lands. Blenda was a woman of noble descent in the Konga Hundred and she decided to send the fiery cross to rally all the womenfolk in the hundreds of Konga, Albo, Kinnevald, Norrvidinge and Uppvidinge. The women armies assembled on the Br√°vellir, which according to Sm√•landish tradition is located in V√§rend and not in √ñsterg√∂tland. The women approached the Danes and told them how much they were impressed with the Danish men. They invited the men to a banquet where they were provided with food and drink. After a long evening, the Danish warriors fell asleep and the women killed every single one of them with axes and staffs. When King Alle returned, he bestowed new rights on the women. They acquired equal inheritance with their brothers and husbands, the right always to wear a belt around their waists as a sign of eternal vigilance, the right to beat the drum at weddings, and so forth. The five hundreds were combined into the land of V√§rend, which means the \\"defense\\", since it was a bulwark for Geatland. Blenda's village was called V√§rnslanda and a location near the battle ground was called Bl√§ndinge. Historicity The Girls of Sm√•land by Hugo Hamilton (1830) The first printed text, where the legend has been connected with the inheritance rights, appeared in Johan Stiernh√∂√∂k's De iure sueonum et gothorum vetusto (1672). He wrote that the inheritance rights were awarded by King Hakon Ring (Sigurd Hring) to the women after the Battle of Br√°vellir, in which they had shown valour against Harald Wartooth. The legend appears in embellished form in the various pleas made in the 1680s and 1690s in order to defend the equal inheritance and the Church's new prohibitions against church drums. The final form probably comes from local historian, Petter Rudebeck (1660‚Äì1710) since both the oldest editions of it are reminiscent of Rudebeck's methodology and language. Petter Rudebeck gathered and wrote down peasant customs, practices, myths and legends of nearly every province of Sm√•land. In 1813, the legend was rendered in the romantic poem Blenda in the first major poem by Erik Johan Stagnelius. If the events did take place under the reign of King Alle, it would have happened about the year 500, which would make it less surprising, as female soldiers were allowed in Sweden before Christianity. So called Shieldmaidens, three hundred female soldiers were recorded having served during the great Battle of Br√•valla (Slaget vid Br√•valla) in 750. Several attempts have been made to support or discredit the legend's historicity. Some authors have proposed that it took place during the battles before the meeting of the three kings Inge I of Sweden, Magnus III of Norway and Eric I of Denmark at Kungah√§lla in 1101, or at the time of Sigurd I of Norway's attack on Kalmar in 1123. Sven Lagerbring (1707‚Äì1787) proposed that it would have taken place during King Sweyn III of Denmark's attack on Sweden in the 1150s. Olof von Dalin (1708‚Äì1763) conjectured that the event may have taken place in the 1270s when King Eric V of Denmark attacked Sm√•land. Carl Johan Schlyter (1795‚Äì1888) suggested that the legend was invented to explain why the women of V√§rend had equal share in the inheritance with the men.

Graduated with honors from the Moscow Institute of Chemical Machine-Building in 1934 and worked as an engineer in a chemical plant for several years in the Tula region. Kvasnikov continued postgraduate engineering studies and joined the KGB in 1938 as a specialist in scientific- technical intelligence. Beginning in 1939 he was the section head of scientific and technical intelligence. Kvasnikov served a few short-term assignments in Germany and Poland and rising swiftly to become deputy chief and then chief of the KGB scientific intelligence section. Kvasnikov was one of the initiators of work in foreign intelligence on the atomic line in 1940 when he noticed that British, American, and German scientists who had regularly published their findings on uranium and related atomic research had ceased to publish. Kvasnikov supervised from Moscow the initial KGB penetration of the British and American atomic bomb projects. In 1943 he went to New York City under diplomatic cover as the deputy of the Rezident. Kvasnikov is noted for his high professional level, a fundamental understanding of the problems of scientific and technical intelligence. Under his management were obtained the most important materials on nuclear power and its use for military purposes, and also the information and equipment models on questions of aviation, chemistry, medicine. Kvasnikov worked very closely with Pavel Fitin, the head of NKVD's foreign intelligence unit, who believed strongly that the Soviet Union needed to develop nuclear weapons. Kvasnikov was sent to America where he assembled a group that included Klaus Fuchs, Theodore Hall, Harry Gold, Julius Rosenberg, David Greenglass and Ruth Greenglass. On 8 May 1944 the NKVD station in New York City reported: \\"Fuchs advises that the work of the British in the United States is not meeting with success in view of the unwillingness of workers of the United States to share secrets with the British. It will be proposed to Fuchs that he should either return to England or work in the special laboratory-camp.\\" NKVD New York Station to Moscow Centre (8 May 1944) Kvasnikov suffered a set-back when one of his agents, Julius Rosenberg, was sacked from the Army Signal Corps Engineering Laboratories at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, when they discovered that he had been a member of the Communist Party of the United States. NKVD headquarters in Moscow sent Kvasnikov a message on 23 February 1945: \\"The latest events with (Julius Rosenberg), his having been fired, are highly serious and demand on our part, first, a correct assessment of what happened, and second, a decision about (Rosenberg's) role in future. Deciding the latter, we should proceed from the fact that, in him, we have a man devoted to us, whom we can trust completely, a man who by his practical activities for several years has shown how strong is his desire to help our country. Besides, in (Rosenberg) we have a capable agent who knows how to work with people and has solid experience in recruiting new agents.\\" NKVD headquarters, message to Leonid Kvasnikov (23 February 1945) Kvasnikov's main concern was that the FBI had discovered that Rosenberg was a spy. To protect the rest of the network, Rosenberg was told not to have any connection with other members of the network. However, the NKVD continued to pay him \\"maintenance\\" and was warned not to take any important decisions about his future work without Krasnikov's consent.Leonid Kvasnikov. spartacus-educational.com On his return to Moscow in 1945 Kvasnikov became deputy division head of scientific and technical intelligence, and in 1947 it headed the division until his resignation in 1963. He attained the rank of colonel and was awarded the Order of Lenin, twice the Order of the Red Banner of Labour, twice the Order of the Red Star, and other medals the Soviet Union.

Early life Percy MacMahon was born in Malta to a British military family. His father was a colonel at the time, retired in the rank of the brigadier.P.R. Stein, \\"Book Review\\" of P.A. MacMahon's \\"Collected Papers\\", Advances in mathematics, vol. 31:3 (1979), 350‚Äì355. MacMahon attended the Proprietary School in Cheltenham. At the age of 14 he won a Junior Scholarship to Cheltenham College, which he attended as a day boy from 10 February 1868 until December 1870. At the age of 16 MacMahon was admitted to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and passed out after two years. Military career On 12 March 1873, MacMahon was posted to Madras, India, with the 1st Battery 5th Brigade, with the temporary rank of lieutenant. The Army List showed that in October 1873 he was posted to the 8th Brigade in Lucknow. MacMahon's final posting was to the No. 1 Mountain Battery with the Punjab Frontier Force at Kohat on the North West Frontier. He was appointed Second Subaltern on 26 January and joined the Battery on 25 February 1877. In the Historical Record of the No. 1 (Kohat) Mountain Battery, Punjab Frontier Force it is recorded that he was sent on sick leave to Muree (or Maree), a town north of Kohat on the banks of the Indus river, on 9 August 1877. On 22 December 1877 he started 18 months leave on a medical certificate granted under GGO number 1144. The nature of his illness is unknown. This period of sick leave was one of the most significant occurrences in MacMahon's life. Had he remained in India he would undoubtedly have been caught up in Roberts's War against the Afghans. In early 1878 MacMahon returned to England and the sequence of events began which led to him becoming a mathematician rather than a soldier. The Army List records a transfer to the 3rd Brigade in Newbridge at the beginning of 1878, and then shows MacMahon as 'supernumerary' from May 1878 until March 1879. In January 1879 MacMahon was posted to the 9th Brigade in Dover, moving to Sheerness in 1880. In the same year he enrolled in the Advanced Class for Artillery Officers at Woolwich. This was a two-year course covering technical subjects and a foreign language. Successful completion of the course resulted in the award of the letters \\"p.a.c\\" (passed advanced class) after MacMahon's name in the Army List. After he passed the Advanced Course and had been promoted to the rank of captain on 29 October 1881, MacMahon took up a post as instructor at the Royal Military Academy on 23 March 1882. Here he met Alfred George Greenhill, professor of mathematics at the Royal Artillery College. Joseph Larmor, in a letter to The Times published after MacMahon's death, wrote, 'The young Captain threw himself with indomitable zeal and insight into the great problems of the rising edifice of algebraic forms, as was being developed by Cayley, Sylvester and Salmon.‚Äô In 1891 MacMahon took up a new post as military instructor in electricity at the Royal Artillery College, Woolwich. Some sources (e.g. his three obituarists) have said that this post was 'professor of physics', but this is not correct, as Greenhill held that post until his own retirement. MacMahon retired from the military in 1898. Mathematical career MacMahon was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1890. He received the Royal Society Royal Medal in 1900, the Sylvester Medal in 1919, and the Morgan Medal by the London Mathematical Society in 1923. MacMahon was the President of the London Mathematical Society from 1894 to 1896. MacMahon is best known for his study of symmetric functions and enumeration of plane partitions; see MacMahon Master theorem. His two volume Combinatory analysis, published in 1915/16, is the first major book in enumerative combinatorics. MacMahon also did pioneering work in recreational mathematics and patented several successful puzzles.  Tribute  A reviewer in \\"Science Progress in the Twentieth Century\\", writes: : It is, I believe, a loss to England and to mathematics that Major MacMahon has not directed a great school of research; the gain to the youthful mathematicians of such a leader is obvious; they would have received an impetus which the printed page will only give to a few. Is it not possible also that the quality of work done in such circumstances may not, like mercy, be doubly blest? [..] it is impossible to resist the feeling that there are countries in which mathematical teaching is better organised than it is in England.Review of Combinatory Analysis, in J. Murray, Science Progress in the Twentieth Century: A Quarterly Journal of Scientific Work & Thought, Vol. 10, No. 40 (April 1916), pp. 601‚Äì606.

It is centrally located on the corners of four adjacent rural municipalities, including the RM of Good Lake. The community is home to approximately 3,500 residents and is part of the Canora-Pelly electoral district. The community was founded along the Canadian Northern Railway tracks - one of the companies that evolved into the Canadian National Railway (CN), and two CN freight lines (one east-west branch line to Saskatoon and one line going north) still run through Canora. The Canora railway station, downtown on the CN east-west line before the switch to the northbound line, is served by Via Rail on its passenger service from Winnipeg to Churchill, Manitoba. Demographics Canora became a village in 1905 and was incorporated as a town in 1910.  History  The area around Canora was first settled by Europeans in the late 19th century by Doukhobors, Romanians, and Ukrainians. The first ranchers arrived in the area in 1884. Two years later, in 1886, the land was officially surveyed by the Dominion government. The first Ukrainian block settlement in Saskatchewan was established in 1897 when 150 families arrived in the Canora District from Western Ukraine. In 1904, the Canadian Northern Railway laid tracks through the area and in April of that same year, a post office was opened, a school district established and a town site was surveyed. A year later, in 1905, Canora was incorporated as a hamlet on the site of the train station, which now serves as the town's museum and tourist information centre. In 1908, Canora became a village. The name Canora, is derived from the first two letters of the words \\"Canadian Northern Railway.\\" By 1910, with a growing population of around 400, Canora had officially achieved the status of a town. In 1912, the first Canora Chamber of Commerce was established. Over the next few decades, the community experienced rapid growth with population levels remaining stable even through the Great Depression. Canora's population peaked in 1966 with about 2,734 residents.  Doukhobor Trading Company  Doukhobors in Canora were key to the town's development and, under the auspices of the Doukhobor Trading Company, undertook an ambitious building program on Second Avenue East, where they established several communally-run enterprises from 1907 to 1918.5  Attractions  Canora boasts several community parks, walking trails, a junior Olympic-sized outdoor swimming pool, Civic Centre, the Sylvia Fedoruk Centre, Sports Service Centre, Sports Grounds, a golf course/activity centre, a tennis court and a skate park.A historical marker for the old Canora Hospital. Lakes & Parks - Canora is known as the \\"Heart of Good Spirit Country\\" as a result of its proximity to several lakes and parks, including Crystal Lake, Good Spirit Lake and Duck Mountain Provincial Park. The area is home to Saskatchewan's greatest number of golf courses per-capita and boasts one of the highest tee traffic counts in the province. Lesia Statue \\\\- Lesia is a 25-foot, 4,000 lb statue that honours the descendants of the Ukrainian and Eastern European settlers who made Canora their home and serves as welcome sign to visitors. The plaque on the base of the statue reads: \\"Welcome - Veetayemo This traditional welcome with the bread and salt to all visitors is a universal custom and practice among Ukrainians and most Eastern European people, whose descendants have settled throughout Canada. To commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the Province of Saskatchewan and the Town of Canora, this symbol has been erected through the efforts of the Canora Chamber of Commerce, the Town of Canora, the Province of Saskatchewan and many other organizations and individuals. Canora Welcome Statue Committee\\". The Lesia statue was created in 1979 by Canora residents Nicholas and Ores Lewchuk and took over a year to complete. The statue features a woman dressed in traditional Ukrainian costume, who is offering visitors a loaf of braided bread, called Kolach along with salt. For Ukrainians, bread is a highly respected food, and salt is viewed as a symbol of a long, enduring friendship. As part of a customary greeting, a loaf of bread, crowned with a salt cellar is set upon an embroidered ritual cloth. Guests are then offered a chunk of bread to dip into the salt. Lesia was officially unveiled on September 3, 1980 by Right Honorable Edward Schreyer, Governor General of Canada to honour Saskatchewan's 75th anniversary. Ukrainian Heritage Museum - Canora's Ukrainian Heritage Museum explores all aspects of Ukrainian culture including history, arts folklore. Displays include exhibits of early settlers' artifacts from the area, books by renowned Ukrainian writers, Ukrainian regional costumes and embroideries, as well as traditional Ukrainian arts and crafts, culinary arts and festive events. The museum is run by volunteers and includes a small gift shop. Station House Museum - Canora's Visitor Information Centre and the CN Station House Museum is located in the oldest Class 3 railway station still operating in Saskatchewan. It was erected in 1904 and its exhibits include displays of CN Rail memorabilia, pioneer artifacts, local art and souvenirs Information regarding rail tours to Churchill, Manitoba is available at the museum with Via Rail service to Winnipeg and Churchill available twice weekly. Toy & Autograph Museum - Canora is home to Canada's Only Toy & Autograph Museum. The museum features a one-of-a-kind collection of over 1,000 toys and autographed photos including Stephen Harper as well as Laurel and Hardy. Holy Trinity Ukrainian Orthodox Heritage Church - A Municipal Heritage Property and Ukrainian Orthodox church that was originally constructed in 1928. The heritage value of Holy Trinity Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church resides in its connection with the congregation. Desiring to continue their cultural and spiritual practices in their adopted homeland, a Ukrainian Greek Orthodox parish was organised here in 1919. A desire to have their own place of worship led to the construction of this church in 1928. Although the parish built a larger church in 1963, this church is still periodically used and remains a landmark in the community. The heritage value of Holy Trinity Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church also lies in its Byzantine architecture. Designed by Temish Pavlychenko, the form, particularly the three domes set atop towers, are inspired by the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Churches of Kiev. The interior is ornately decorated in the Byzantine tradition. Installed in 1944, the iconostasis is richly decorated with Ukrainian Orthodox iconography. The church closed in 1963, was designated a heritage site in 1984 and underwent a major restoration that was completed in 2000. Hugh Waddell Memorial (Canora Hospital) Site - Is a cairn dedicated to Canora's first hospital. Mary Waddell of Peterborough, Ont., donated $25,000 to the Presbyterian Church for construction of a hospital in her husband's name. In 1913, the Hugh Waddell Memorial Hospital was built on land donated by Christian R. Graham. It was erected by the Presbyterian Home Mission Society, one of two mission hospitals in Saskatchewan. Admitting patients in March, the hospital was officially opened on June 18, 1914, with 60 beds. It operated as a mission hospital until 1944 when it was purchased by the Canora Union Hospital Board. In 1950, a new wing was added, increasing its capacity to 82 beds. The hospital closed on July 4, 1968, and a commemorative cairn was erected in 2000. Trails - Canora boasts more than 150 km of trails, including over 144 km of marked and groomed snowmobile trails and more than 10 km of walking, cycling, jogging and cross-country ski trails. Trail surfaces vary from pavement to gravel and even include a foot bridge. These trails include; the Trans Canada Snowmobile Trail, with over ninety miles of signed and groomed trails in the immediate area and access to numerous other snowmobile trails, the Trans-Canada Trail, which f will take you to some of the most popular out-of-town attractions. Westward travellers will come upon the Good Spirit Lake Provincial Park, Burgis Beach and Canora Beach; while eastward travellers will discover Duck Mountain Lake Provincial Park and the National Doukhobor Heritage Village. The Urban Habitat Trail that was created by the River Ridge Wildlife Club and formed in-cooperation with the Town of Canora, Ducks Unlimited Canada and the PFRA. This trail is an educational and interpretive trail that highlights the natural habitat, wildlife and plant species of the area. The 8.6 km long Walking Trail that winds through Canora's natural landscape. Water - Canora was judged to have the best-tasting municipal water in Canada at the 13th annual international water tasting competition held in 2003 in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia, U.S. Canora's water, supplied by several ground wells northeast of the community, also placed fourth internationally at the competition that received entries from eight countries and 23 states. Free samples of this great-tasting water are available at the CN Station House Museum during the summer months. Nicholas Lewchuk Property - The Nicholas Lewchuk Property is a Municipal Heritage Property that features a house, a ferris wheel, an airplane swing and two midway trailers. The Lewchuk family emigrated from the Ukraine when Nicholas was a child and homesteaded near Canora in 1902. Lewchuck's eclectic interests came to include vaudeville, publishing, magic, photography, design, recording and horticulture. In the 1920s, he founded a travelling vaudeville show and carnival that toured the prairies and western Ontario for the next five decades. Lewchuk designed and built the carnival rides himself, the ‚Äúairplane swing‚Äù being the first. Around 1908, Lewchuk's father built the house and Nicholas lived here during the ‚Äúoff-season‚Äù for most of his life. From an office off the main entrance, he wrote and edited English and Ukrainian periodicals and ran the seed catalogue business founded by his mother. In 1968 the rides, trailers and animal pens from the travelling carnival were set up permanently in the yard behind the house. Known as the ‚ÄúFun Spot,‚Äù Lewchuk operated his midway intermittently for the next few years. Lewchuk continued his publishing, editing and horticultural activities intermittently until his death in 1990.

He played for 11 seasons as a catcher in Major League Baseball for the New York Giants from to and was known as a superb defensive catcher.Wes Westrun New York Times Obituary, May 30, 2002 He served as the second manager in the history of the New York Mets, replacing Casey Stengel in 1965 after the latter fractured his hip and was forced to retire.Wes Westrum Manager's record at Baseball Reference Major League playing career A native of Clearbrook, Minnesota, Westrum was a stalwart defensive player for the New York Giants (1947‚Äì57) and, in his prime, a powerful right-handed hitter, although he had trouble making contact and hit for a low .217 career batting average. He began his major league career as the Giants' reserve catcher, playing behind Walker Cooper. When Cooper was traded in 1949, Westrum shared the catching duties with Ray Mueller for the remainder of the season. He became the full-time catcher for the Giants in 1950, leading National League catchers with a .999 fielding percentage, 31 baserunners caught stealing, a 54.4% caught stealing percentage and 71 assists, and finished second to Roy Campanella with 608 putouts. Westrum was a key player for the Giants‚Äô during the remarkable pennant race in which the Giants, 13 games behind the Brooklyn Dodgers on August 12, fought back to win 16 games in a row and finished the season tied with the Dodgers for first place. His two-run, eighth-inning home run against Ralph Branca on August 13 snapped a 1‚Äì1 tie and gave the Giants a 3‚Äì1 victory over the Dodgers.Hirsch, pp. 123-24 Westrum contributed 20 home runs with 70 runs batted in, and led National League catchers in baserunners caught stealing. The two teams met in the 1951 National League tie-breaker series in which the Giants' season was climaxed by Bobby Thomson's Shot Heard 'Round the World, a three-run home run in the bottom of the ninth inning for a 5‚Äì4 win of the third and final playoff game. Afterwards, the Giants would lose to the New York Yankees in the 1951 World Series. His 1952 season was plagued by injuries and he only managed to hit for a .220 batting average in 114 games, although he still managed to finish second to Del Rice among catchers in assists. Westrum remained the Giants' starting catcher throughout the 1954 season, catching all four games in the 1954 World Series against the Cleveland Indians. Injuries continued to take their toll, and by 1955, Ray Katt had replaced him as the starting catcher. Westrum lasted three more seasons but never played more than 70 games a year.Hirsch, p. 238 On September 29, manager Bill Rigney started all the Giants who had been on the 1954 World Series team in the ballclub's final game at the Polo Grounds; Westrum caught during the 9‚Äì1 loss to Pittsburgh.Hirsch, p. 265 When the Giants moved to San Francisco in , he was offered a role as a third-string catcher or as a coach. He decided to retire as a player at the age of 34, and accepted the coaching job. Career statistics In an eleven-year major league career, Westrum played in 919 games, accumulating 503 hits in 2,322 at bats for a .217 career batting average along with 96 home runs, 315 runs batted in, and a .356 on-base percentage. He ended his career with a .985 fielding percentage. In the 1950 season, he committed only one error in 139 games played, and had 21 double plays, the 11th highest season total for a catcher.Turn Back The Clock, Former Catcher Wes Westrum Recalls Career With Giants, by Bob Mayer, Baseball Digest, November 2001, Vol. 60, No. 11, Catchers Double Plays at The Encyclopedia of Catchers Westrum's 1950 fielding percentage of .999 stood as a National League record for catchers, until it was surpassed by Charles Johnson in .Single- Season Fielding Percentage Leaders at Baseball Reference He made the National League All-Star teams in 1952 and 1953.1952 All-Star Game at Baseball Reference1953 All-Star Game at Baseball Reference Westrum's 49.29% career caught stealing percentage ranks 21st all-time among major league catchers. He played more games as a catcher than any other player in Giants history (902).Most Games Caught for Team at The Encyclopedia of Catchers In his biography of Willie Mays, James S. Hirsch said the , Westrum was \\"built like a block of granite,\\" praising his defensive abilities.Hirsch, pp. 124-25 Westrum was pictured on the cover of the first issue of Sports Illustrated on August 16, 1954, along with Milwaukee Braves star Eddie Mathews. Coach and manager Westrum served as the Giants' bullpen coach and then became their first base coach through the 1963 season. He joined the Mets as a coach in 1964, working at first base and then in the bullpen, and became pitching coach on July 14, 1965, after the release of pitcher-coach Warren Spahn. But only 11 days later, Westrum was named the Mets' interim manager when Stengel, 75, fractured his left hip getting out of a car on July 25. On that day, the Mets were 31‚Äì64, in tenth and last place in the National League.Retrosheet They fared no better under Westrum for the rest of 1965, losing 48 of the 67 games under his leadership. The hip fracture would end Stengel's Hall of Fame managerial career. Westrum then was appointed the second full-time manager in the history of the perennial last-place club. But his 1966 Mets escaped the basement for the first time in the franchise's five-year history when they finished ninth, one notch above the cellar, posting a record of 66 wins and 95 losses, a 16-game improvement over the previous season. The Mets were slowly developing an array of young pitchers in the minor leagues; however, apart from Tom Seaver, none arrived in time to help Westrum in 1967, when New York again finished tenth and last. Westrum resigned with 11 games to go in the season.Westrum quits Mets Coach Salty Parker took over the team for the remaining games of the 1967 season, and Gil Hodges was named manager for 1968. Westrum then rejoined the Giants as a coach (1968‚Äì71) and scout. They eventually gave him a second managing opportunity on June 28, 1974, when he succeeded Charlie Fox with the club in fifth place. He was not able to post a winning record in his 1¬Ω years as San Francisco's manager, although he came close when his team finished one game under .500 in 1975 and in third place in the National League Western Division. That marked his last year as a major league manager, although Westrum stayed in the game as a scout for the Atlanta Braves for many years. His final record as a manager: 260 wins and 366 losses (.415). Westrum died from cancer at the age of 79 in Clearbrook, Minnesota on May 28, 2002.

He pitched primarily as a starting pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals and Cleveland Indians. Reyes attended the University of Southern California (USC), before the Cardinals selected him in the 15th round of the 2003 MLB draft, and made his major league debut on August 9, 2005. During his playing career, Reyes threw and batted right-handed, stood tall, and weighed . A native of Whittier, California, Reyes became the Cardinals' top prospect in their minor league system. As a rookie, he was a member of the Cardinals' 2006 World Series championship team, including starting Game 1. Following his playing career, he became a firefighter for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. High school Reyes attended California High School in Whittier, California. He was once considered too small to be a pitcher, but proved the coaches wrong and played varsity and went on to USC. He goes back to California High during the off season to practice and stays in touch with the coaches. College career Reyes spent his college years at the University of Southern California from 2000 to 2003, and though he was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 13th round of the amateur draft, he elected to return to school for his senior year. He was on several USC teams with San Diego Padres pitcher Mark Prior. In four seasons with the Trojans, Reyes compiled a 17‚Äì16 record and earned Pac-10 honors three times. He was drafted in the 15th round by the St. Louis Cardinals in . Professional career Reyes was eventually considered the top pitching prospect in the St. Louis farm system. He spent the season initially with the Palm Beach Cardinals, where he compiled a 3-0 record with a 4.66 ERA, and then later with the Tennessee Smokies, where he achieved a 6-2 record with a 2.91 ERA. After a solid season with the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds, Reyes was given a chance to prove himself in the major leagues. On August 9, at Miller Park, Reyes threw 6 innings in his debut start against the Milwaukee Brewers, earning the win and giving up just two runs on two hits. He was demoted immediately after the game, having fulfilled his role of giving the regular rotation an extra day's rest by manager Tony La Russa. Reyes opened the season with Memphis. He was recalled to St. Louis June 23 when Mark Mulder was placed on the disabled list. As a result, Reyes was asked to start the final game of a three-game series against the Chicago White Sox. In the previous two games, the White Sox scored 33 runs against the Cardinals. In the third game Reyes threw 90 pitches, 67 for strikes, had six strikeouts and no walks, and carried a no-hitter into the seventh inning. The only White Sox hit was a home run by Jim Thome. The Cardinals offense could not respond in kind and the White Sox won, 1‚Äì0. Reyes pitched an eight inning complete game and took the loss despite giving up only the one hit (albeit a home run) to Thome. During the Cardinals' 2006 playoff run, Reyes was left off the roster for the National League Division Series against the San Diego Padres. However, after advancing to the National League Championship Series against the New York Mets, the Cardinals added him to the roster in place of starting pitcher Jason Marquis. Reyes started Game 4 of the series and pitched four innings, taking a no-decision. He started the first game of the 2006 World Series against fellow rookie Justin Verlander and earned the win, pitching eight innings and retiring 17 consecutive batters from the first through the sixth inning; a World Series record for a rookie. Reyes gave up two runs and earned player of the game honors. The Cardinals went on to win the series, defeating the Detroit Tigers four games to one. After starting the season 0‚Äì8 with a 6.08 ERA (although he had the worst run support in the majors), the Cardinals optioned him to Memphis on May 27. Todd Wellemeyer replaced him in the Cardinals starting rotation. He made three strong starts for the Redbirds and was recalled to St. Louis June 16, but was optioned back to Memphis again on July 2. Reyes was called up again from Memphis to make a spot start in a doubleheader against Milwaukee. He pitched well allowing 2 runs on two hits. Reyes began the season in St. Louis's bullpen, going 2‚Äì1 with a 4.91 ERA before being demoted to Triple-A Memphis. He went 2‚Äì3 with a 3.25 ERA in 11 starts at Memphis. On July 26, 2008, Reyes was traded to the Cleveland Indians for right-handed reliever Luis Perdomo and cash. On August 8, 2008, the Indians promoted Reyes from Triple-A Buffalo. That same day, he made his first start for Cleveland, going 6 innings, allowing just 1 run, and picked up the win. Reyes was non-tendered by the Indians on December 12, 2009, making him a free agent. He was re-signed to a minor league contract on December 13. During spring training his contract was purchased by the Indians, at which time he was placed on the 60-day disabled list, while recovering from Tommy John surgery. After spending the entire 2010 season on the disabled list, Reyes was outrighted to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers on October 29, 2010. After electing free agency, Reyes signed a one-year minor league contract with the Indians on November 15. His contract includes a non-roster invitation to the Indians' 2011 spring training camp. Reyes spent the 2011 season rehabbing his injured elbow, never appearing on the 40-man roster. He was released by the Indians on August 5, 2011, and retired after a season in the San Diego Padres organization. Personal life Reyes has a younger brother, Erik, who pitched for Concordia University Irvine in . Reyes became a Los Angeles County firefighter in March 2017, and was pressed into action to combat the wildfires in California later that year.

The team ran cars in many motorsport categories including Formula One, Formula Two, Formula Ford, Formula Junior, IndyCar, and sports car racing. More than ten years after its last race, Team Lotus remained one of the most successful racing teams of all time, winning seven Formula One Constructors' titles, six Drivers' Championships, and the Indianapolis 500 in the United States between 1962 and 1978. Under the direction of founder and chief designer Colin Chapman, Lotus was responsible for many innovative and experimental developments in critical motorsport, in both technical and commercial arenas. The Lotus name returned to Formula One in 2010 as Tony Fernandes's Lotus Racing team. In 2011, Team Lotus's iconic black-and-gold livery returned to F1 as the livery of the Lotus Renault GP team, sponsored by Lotus Cars, and in 2012 the team was re-branded completely as Lotus F1 Team. 1950s ‚Äì Lotus's origins Colin Chapman established Lotus Engineering Ltd in 1952 at Hornsey, UK. Lotus achieved rapid success with the 1953 Mk 6 and the 1954 Mk 8 sports cars. Team Lotus was split off from Lotus Engineering in 1954. A new Formula Two regulation was announced for 1957, and in Britain, several organizers ran races for the new regulations during the course of 1956. Most of the cars entered that year were sports cars, and they included a large number of Lotus 11s, the definitive Coventry Climax-powered sports racer, led by the Team Lotus entries for Chapman, driven by Cliff Allison and Reg Bicknell. A 1955 Lotus Mk IX Lotus Eleven cars for Le Mans 24 hours, 1956 The following year, the Lotus 12 appeared. Driving one in 1958, Allison won the F2 class in the International Trophy at Silverstone, beating Stuart Lewis-Evans's Cooper. The remarkable Coventry Climax-powered Type 14, the Lotus Cars production version of which was the original Lotus Elite, won six class victories, plus the \\"Index of Performance\\" several times at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. As the Coventry Climax engines were enlarged in 1952 to 2.2-litres, Chapman decided to enter Grand Prix racing, running a pair of Lotus 12s at Monaco in 1958 for Graham Hill and Cliff Allison. These were replaced later that year by Lotus 16s. In 1959 ‚Äì by which time the Coventry Climax engines had been stretched to 2.5-litres ‚Äì Chapman continued with front-engined F1 cars, but achieved little, so in 1960 Chapman switched to the milestone mid-engined Lotus 18. By then, the company's success had caused it to expand to such an extent that it had to move to new premises at Cheshunt. Domination in 1960s and 1970s The first Formula One victory for Team Lotus came when Innes Ireland won the 1961 United States Grand Prix. A year earlier, Stirling Moss had recorded the first victory for a Lotus car at Monaco in his Lotus 18 entered by the independent Rob Walker Racing Team. There were successes in Formula Two and Formula Junior. The road car business was doing well with the Lotus Seven and the Lotus Elite and this was followed by the Lotus Elan in 1962. More racing success followed with the 26R, the racing version of the Elan, and in 1963 with the Lotus Cortina, which Jack Sears drove to the British Saloon Car Championship title, a feat repeated by Jim Clark in 1964 and Alan Mann in the 1965 European Touring car Championship. Lotus 49 Lotus 77 Cosworth DFV V8 engine introduced into Formula One by Lotus in Jim Clark outside the Lotus garage at the N√ºrburgring in 1966 In 1963, Clark drove the Lotus 25 to a remarkable seven wins in a season and won the World Championship. The 1964 title was still for the taking by the time of the last race in Mexico but problems with Clark's Lotus and Hill's BRM gave it to Surtees in his Ferrari. However, in 1965, Clark dominated again, six wins in his Lotus 33 gave him the championship. While very innovative, Chapman also came under criticism for the structural fragility of his designs. The number of top drivers seriously injured or killed in Lotus machinery was considerable ‚Äì notably Stirling Moss, Alan Stacey, Mike Taylor, Jim Clark, Mike Spence, Bobby Marshman, Graham Hill, Jochen Rindt and Ronnie Peterson. In Dave Friedman's book \\"Indianapolis Memories 1961‚Äì1969\\", Dan Gurney is quoted as saying, \\"Did I think the Lotus way of doing things was good? No. We had several structural failures in those cars [Indianapolis Lotus 34 and 38]. But at the time, I felt it was the price you paid for getting something significantly better.\\" When the Formula One engine size increased to three litres in 1966, Lotus was caught unprepared partly because of the surprising failure of the Coventry Climax 1.5-Litre FWMW Flat-16 project, which prevented Climax from developing a 3-Litre successor. They started the season fielding the hastily prepared and uncompetitive two-litre Coventry-Climax FWMV V8 engine, only switching to the BRM P75 H16 engine in time for the Italian Grand Prix, with the new engine proving to be overweight and unreliable. A switch to the new Ford Cosworth DFV, designed by former Lotus employee Keith Duckworth, in 1967 returned the team to winning form. Although they failed to win the title in 1967, by the end of the season, the Lotus 49 and the DFV engine were mature enough to make the Lotus team dominant again. However, for 1968 Lotus had lost its exclusive right to use the DFV. The season-opening 1968 South African Grand Prix confirmed Lotus's superiority, with Jim Clark and Graham Hill finishing 1‚Äì2. It would be Clark's last win. On 7 April 1968, Clark, one of the most successful and popular drivers of all time, was killed driving a Lotus 48 at Hockenheim in a non-championship Formula Two event. The season saw the introduction of wings as seen previously on various cars, including the Chaparral sports car. Colin Chapman introduced modest front wings and a spoiler on Hill's Lotus 49B at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix. Graham Hill won the F1 World Championship in 1968 driving the Lotus 49. Around the same time, Chapman moved Lotus to new premises at Hethel in Norfolk. A new factory was built on the site, the former RAF Hethel bomber base, and the old runways were converted into a testing facility. The offices and design studios were based at nearby Ketteringham Hall, which became the headquarters of both Team Lotus and Lotus Cars. Additional car testing was carried out at Snetterton, a few miles from Hethel. In 1969, the team spent a lot of time experimenting with a gas turbine powered car, and, after four wet races in 1968, with four wheel drive. Both were unsuccessful, especially as every race was dry. They penned a revolutionary new car for 1970 ‚Äì the wedge-shaped Lotus 72. The new Lotus 72 was a very innovative car, featuring torsion bar suspension, hip-mounted radiators, inboard front brakes and an overhanging rear wing. The 72 originally had suspension problems, and Jochen Rindt took a lucky victory in Monaco in the old 49 when Jack Brabham crashed on the last lap while leading. But when antidive and antisquat were designed out of the suspension, the car quickly showed its superiority, and Rindt dominated the championship until he was killed at Monza when a brake shaft broke. Rindt had only recently begun to wear a shoulder harness, but refused to wear crotch straps because he felt they slowed his exit from the car in the event of fire. When the car hit the barrier head-on, Rindt submarined forward and the lap belt inflicted fatal head and neck injuries. The rest of the 1970 season was nailbiting, as Ferrari closed in on Rindt's undefended lead. A brilliant victory in the US GP by rookie driver Emerson Fittipaldi, who had made his debut in the British GP in a 49, sealed the championship for Rindt, who became the only man in history to win the world championship posthumously. Lotus's 1971 experiments did not bring any serious advance in technology, but allowed Chapman to test several drivers. For 1972, the team focused again on the type 72 chassis, with Imperial Tobacco continuing its sponsorship of the team under its new John Player Special brand. The cars, now often referred to as 'JPS', were fielded in a new black and gold livery ‚Äì ca new brand developed to make the most of the promotional power of motorsport. Lotus took the championship by surprise in 1972 with 25-year-old Brazilian driver Emerson Fittipaldi, who became at the time the youngest world champion, a distinction he held until 2005, when 24-year-old Fernando Alonso took the accolade. Team Lotus also won the F1 World Championship for Manufacturers for a sixth time in 1973. Then, the 72 became outdated, while successor models, such as the Lotus 76 were disappointing. The first-ever Formula Ford car was built around a Formula 3 Lotus, the Type 51. Chapman was also successful at Indianapolis with the Lotus 29, almost winning the 500 at its first attempt in 1963 with Clark at the wheel. The race marked the beginning of the end for the old front-engined Indianapolis roadsters. Clark was leading when he retired from the 1964 event with suspension failure, but in 1965, he won the biggest prize in US racing driving his Lotus 38 and winning by a lap; it was the first mid-engined car to win the Indianapolis 500. Many of Chapman's successes came from innovation. The Lotus 25 was the first monocoque chassis in F1, the 49 was the first car of note to use the engine as a stressed member, the Lotus 56 Indycar was powered by a gas turbine engine and was fitted with four-wheel drive, the Lotus 63 was the first mid-engined F1 car to race with four-wheel drive, and the 72 broke new ground in aerodynamics. Chapman was also an innovator as a team boss. For , the FIA decided to permit sponsorship after the withdrawal of support from automotive-related firms, such as BP, Shell and Firestone. In April, Team Lotus was the first works team to paint their cars in the livery of their sponsors, with Clark's Type 48 F2 appearing at Hockenheim in the red, gold and white colors of Imperial Tobacco's Gold Leaf brand.Team Gunston as a privateer team became the first Formula One team to paint their cars in the livery of their sponsors when they entered a private Brabham at the 1968 South African Grand Prix. The first Formula One car in this livery was Graham Hill's Lotus 49B entered at the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix in Jarama. Team Lotus as a constructor was first to achieve 50 Grand Prix victories. (Ferrari was the second to do so, having won their first Formula One race in 1951, seven years before the first Lotus F1 car.) In the mid-to-late 1970s, Lotus experienced a resurgence with Mario Andretti joining the team. This came about the morning after the 1976 U.S. Grand Prix West at Long Beach, when Andretti's VPJ- Parnelli had proven uncompetitive. Bob Evans did not qualify his Lotus and Gunnar Nilsson, in the other Lotus 77, qualified 8th only to fall out with suspension failure before completing a lap. Chapman and Andretti ran into each other in a hotel coffee shop the morning after the race, and decided to join forces. Andretti's development expertise helped give new life to the then- moribund Lotus 77. Engineers began to investigate aerodynamic ground effects. The Lotus 78, and then the Lotus 79 of 1978 were extraordinarily successful, with Mario Andretti winning the F1 World Championship. Lotus attempted to take ground effects further with the Lotus 80 and Lotus 88. The team developed an all-carbon-fibre car, the Lotus 88, in 1981. The 88 was banned from racing for its 'twin chassis' technology where the driver had separate suspension from the aerodynamic parts of the car. McLaren's MP4/1 beat it as the first all- carbon-fibre car to race. Chapman was beginning work on an active suspension development programme when he died of a heart attack in December 1982 at the age of 54. 1980s Nigel Mansell set his first pole position in the Renault- powered Lotus 95T at the 1984 Dallas Grand Prix. After Chapman's death, the racing team was continued by his widow, Hazel, and managed by Peter Warr,GrandPrix.com. \\"Ex-Lotus boss Peter Warr dies\\". 6 October 2010. Accessed 23 June 2011. http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns22654.html but a series of F1 designs proved unsuccessful. Midway through 1983 Lotus hired French designer G√©rard Ducarouge and, in five weeks, he built the Renault turbo powered 94T. A switch to Goodyear tyres in 1984 enabled Elio de Angelis to finish third in the World Championship, despite the fact that the Italian did not win a race. The Team also finished in 3rd place in the Constructors' Championship. Ayrton Senna's Lotus 99T on display in 2010. The Brazilian driver gave Lotus its last ever Grand Prix win when he won the 1987 Detroit Grand Prix in the active suspension-equipped 99T. When Nigel Mansell departed at the end of the year the team hired Ayrton Senna. The Lotus 97T scored victories with de Angelis at Imola and Senna in Portugal and Belgium. The team, although it had now won three races instead of nil, lost 3rd in the Constructors' Championship to Williams (who beat them on countback with 4 wins). Senna scored eight pole positions, with two wins (Spain and Detroit) in 1986 driving the evolutionary Lotus 98T. Lotus regained 3rd in the Constructors' Championship, passing Ferrari. At the end of the year the team lost its long-time John Player & Sons Ltd backing (John Player Special) and found new sponsorship with Camel. Senna's skills attracted the attention of the Honda Motor Company and when Lotus agreed to run Satoru Nakajima as its second driver a deal for engines was agreed. The Ducarouge-designed 99T featured active suspension, but Senna was able to win just twice: at Monaco and Detroit, with the Team again finishing 3rd in the Constructors' Championship, like the previous year behind British rivals Williams and McLaren, but ahead of Ferrari. The Brazilian moved to McLaren in 1988, and Lotus signed Senna's countryman and then World Champion Nelson Piquet from Williams. Both Piquet and Nakajima failed to make any impressions in terms of fighting for victories. However the team still managed to finish 4th in the Constructors' Championship. Lotus showed in 1988 that it took more than a Honda engine to win races. 1988 was the year in which McLaren (with Senna and Alain Prost) won 15 of the season's 16 races with the same specification Honda engines as Lotus were using. The best result for the team however was three 3rd places for Piquet in Brazil, San Marino and Australia. Lotus at times were hard pressed fighting off the less powerful naturally aspirated V8 cars during the season and rarely challenged either McLaren or Ferrari. The Lotus-Honda 100T was not a success and Ducarouge in mid 1989 returned to France. Lotus hired Frank Dernie to replace him. With the new normally aspirated engine regulations in 1989 Lotus lost its Honda turbo engines and moved to Judd V8 engines. In the middle of the year Warr departed and was replaced as team manager by Rupert Manwaring, while long time Lotus senior executive Tony Rudd was brought in as chairman. At 1989, the best result for the team however was 4th places for Piquet in UK, Canada, Japan and 4th place and fastest lap for Nakajima in Australia. At the end of the season Piquet went to Benetton and Nakajima to Tyrrell. 1990s  A deal was organized for Lamborghini V12 engines and Derek Warwick and Martin Donnelly were hired to drive for 1990. The Dernie design was not a success with Warwick scoring all the three points for a 6th in the 1990 Canadian Grand Prix and a 5th in the 1990 Hungarian Grand Prix; Donnelly was nearly killed in a violent accident at Jerez. At the end of the year Camel withdrew their sponsorship. The Lamborghini 3512 used in the Lotus 102 in . It was the only time a Lotus used a V12 engine in Grand Prix racing. Lotus 102B as used in the F1 season. Former Team Lotus employees Peter Collins and Peter Wright organized a deal to take over the team from the Chapman family and in December the new Team Lotus was launched with Mika H√§kkinen and Julian Bailey being signed for the 1991 season to drive updated Lotus 102Bs with Judd engines. At the 1991 San Marino Grand Prix, the team scored its first double points finish since the 1988 Brazilian Grand Prix, with H√§kkinen in fifth and Bailey in sixth. Despite this, Bailey was soon replaced by Johnny Herbert for the balance of the season. For the following year, the team signed a deal to use Ford's HB V8 in their new Lotus 107s, designed by Chris Murphy. The team was now short on money and this affected performance, but the car allowed H√§kkinen to score 11 points, including two fourth places at the 1992 French Grand Prix (where he had failed to qualify the previous year) and the 1992 Hungarian Grand Prix, while Herbert scored two points for 6th Places at the 1992 South African Grand Prix and 1992 French Grand Prix. The team finished 5th in the Constructors' Championship. H√§kkinen, who finished 8th in the 1992 Drivers' Championship, moved to McLaren as a test driver in 1993. He was replaced by Alessandro Zanardi, who was himself replaced by Pedro Lamy after crashing heavily at the 1993 Belgian Grand Prix, where Herbert scored the last two points for Team Lotus. Over the year, the team scored 12 points despite the tight budget and finished 6th in the 1993 Constructors' Championship. Herbert finished 9th in the Drivers' Championship with three 4th placements: the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix, where he lost 3rd to Benetton's Michael Schumacher shortly before the end of the race; the 1993 European Grand Prix, where he made only one pit stop for tyres; and the 1993 British Grand Prix, where he was not far behind Riccardo Patrese's 3rd placed Benetton at the end, having benefited from the retirements of Ayrton Senna, Martin Brundle and Damon Hill. Zanardi scored one 6th place at the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix, the last race with both Lotus cars in the points. Debts were mounting and the team was unable to develop the Lotus 107. For the 1994 season, the team gambled on success with Mugen Honda engines. Herbert and Lamy struggled on with the old car for the first few races. The Portuguese driver was seriously injured in an accident in testing at Silverstone and Zanardi returned. The team's new car, the Lotus 109, was introduced at the 1994 Spanish Grand Prix, five races into the season, but only one car was available until the French Grand Prix two races later. In an effort to survive the team took on pay-driver Philippe Adams at the 1994 Belgian Grand Prix, but by the time of the Italian Grand Prix Zanardi was back in the car. Herbert qualified fourth in the 109, but at the first corner he was punted off by the Jordan of Eddie Irvine. Herbert later commented that he felt he could have won the race. The following day the team applied for an Administration Order to protect itself from creditors. Tom Walkinshaw pounced and bought Johnny Herbert's contract, moving him into Ligier and then Benetton. An Administration Order was made in respect of the Company on 12 September 1994, and it was compulsorily wound up by the Court on 13 February 1995. A sworn statement of affairs showed that the company had an estimated deficiency of ¬£12,050,000. Disqualification Orders were made against Peter Collins, and Peter Wright on 15 October 1998 for nine years, and seven years respectively. Before the end of the 1994 season, the team had been sold to David Hunt, brother of 1976 World Champion James, and Mika Salo was hired to replace Herbert for the last two races of the season. In December, however, work on the design of a new car (the Lotus 112) was halted and the staff laid off. In February 1995 Hunt announced an alliance with Pacific Grand Prix, who like Lotus were also based in Norfolk in the UK, and Team Lotus came to an end. Pacific were initially referred to as Pacific Team Lotus and their car featured a green stripe with the Lotus logo. Pacific left Formula One after the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. The last race for Lotus was the 1994 Australian Grand Prix. 2010: return of Lotus name in Formula One Following the 1994 collapse ‚Äì but before the end of that season ‚Äì the rights to the name Team Lotus were purchased by David Hunt, brother of former F1 champion James Hunt. In 2009, when the FIA announced an intention to invite entries for a budget-limited championship in 2010, Litespeed acquired the right to submit an entry under the historic name. Lotus Cars, the sister company of the original Team Lotus, distanced itself from the new entry and announced its willingness to take action to protect its name and reputation if necessary. When the 2010 entry list was released on 12 June 2009, the Litespeed Team Lotus entry was not one of those selected. In September 2009, reports emerged of plans for the Malaysian Government to back a Lotus named entry for the 2010 championship to promote the Malaysian car manufacturer Proton, which owns Lotus Cars. On 15 September 2009 the FIA announced that the Malaysian backed team Lotus Racing had been granted admission into the 2010 season. Group Lotus later terminated the licence for future seasons as a result of what it called \\"flagrant and persistent breaches of the licence by the team\\". A little over one year later, on 24 September 2010, it was announced that Tony Fernandes (Lotus Racing) had acquired the name rights of Team Lotus from David Hunt, marking the official rebirth of Team Lotus in Formula One. Then on 8 December 2010, Genii Capital and Group Lotus plc announced the creation of \\"Lotus Renault GP\\", the successor to the Renault F1 Team that would contest the 2011 FIA Formula One World Championship. The announcement came as part of a 'strategic alliance' between the two companies and at the time meant there would be two teams running as Lotus that season. Although neither had any physical links to the pre-1994 Team Lotus Formula 1 team, only Fernandes's \\"Team Lotus\\" had the name, while Lotus-Renault was backed by Group Lotus plc. On 23 December 2010, the Chapman family released a statement in which they unequivocally backed Group Lotus in the dispute over the use of the Lotus name in Formula One, and made it clear that they would prefer that the Team Lotus name did not return to F1. On 27 May 2011, Justice Peter Smith finally made his verdict public in High Court, giving permission to Tony Fernandes to naming his F1 team Team Lotus after purchasing the rights to the name from previous owner David Hunt. Added to that, Group Lotus are entitled to race in F1 using the historic black and gold livery and have the right to use the Lotus marque on cars for road use. In summary, the 2011 Formula One season had two teams running the Lotus name with Group Lotus entitled to use the name \\"Lotus\\" on its own while Fernandes's team used \\"Team Lotus\\". In 2012, Lotus-Renault GP was given the rights to the Lotus name and was renamed Lotus F1, whereas Fernandes's team was renamed Caterham F1 following his purchase of Caterham Cars. The team was active for 4 seasons, then it returned to the French constructor Renault.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 1, 1998. It was written by Ron Hauge and directed by Dominic Polcino. The episode sees Moe trying to keep his new girlfriend by using a large amount of money, but when it runs out, he decides to commit insurance fraud. Homer helps him, but is caught and sent to jail, and attempts to take revenge on Moe when he does not bail him out. Helen Hunt makes a guest appearance as Moe's girlfriend, Renee. The episode contains several cultural references and was generally well-received. Plot At Moe's Tavern, Homer notices that Moe is depressed because he cannot get a date. Homer decides to take Moe out to meet a woman. The trip to a disco proves to be unsuccessful, but on their way home, a flower vendor named Renee starts a conversation with Moe, and he ends up asking her out. Moe and Renee seem to form a strong relationship, but Moe is insecure about his hold on her and he feels he must spend large amounts of money so she will stay with him. Upon maxing out his credit card, Moe comes up with a scheme to commit insurance fraud by having Homer steal his car and park it on train tracks so it would be destroyed. The night the scheme is supposed to take place, Moe and Renee attend a police charity event aboard a yacht; the event's attendance by all the officers in town ensures Homer will not get caught perpetrating the scheme, and gives Moe an alibi so that no one will suspect he was behind the act. Homer botches the plan by stopping to watch a drive-in movie, while the train they were counting on to destroy Moe's car passes by. Deciding all is not lost, Homer drives the car over a cliff ‚Äî but his attempt to exit the car before it sinks into the water below fails. The car ends up sinking just near the yacht where the police charity event is taking place, and when Homer swims to the surface, he is arrested. Moe speaks to Homer through the bars of his jail cell window and promises to bail him out, but changes his mind when Renee talks about wanting to vacation in Hawaii. While packing for the trip, Moe is confronted by his own conscience, in the form of Homer, who makes him feel bad for his betrayal. Moe ends up telling Renee the truth about the insurance fraud scheme, and she is at first happy he was honest. However, when Moe starts scheming again for a way to get Homer out of jail without paying the bail, Renee is disgusted and leaves him. Moe's idea involved setting his bar on fire, which he ends up doing by accident as he realizes Renee has left. Meanwhile, Homer escapes jail by attacking Hans Moleman, who was delivering books to the inmates. He enters the burning bar to confront Moe, and the two start fighting. They are both soon rendered unconscious from smoke inhalation, but Barney appears and rescues them. The bar is completely destroyed, and during their reconciliation Homer promises to help Moe get back on his feet. In the final scene, Homer has allowed Moe to temporarily relocate his bar to the Simpsons' home. Production The episode was written by Ron Hauge, who has said he thought of the episode while attempting to create a story involving general illegal activity. Originally, Hauge had a different title for the episode, \\"Mutual of Moemaha\\", parodying the name of the Mutual of Omaha insurance company. The episode was going to add to the development of Moe's character in the show, though the staff did not think they were able to develop him more until later episodes. Director Dominic Polcino and the animators of the episode were praised for their efforts by the other staff members, especially during the scene where Homer is driving down the cliff and attempts to escape Moe's car. Polcino and his animators went to great lengths to correctly time Homer's rolling and create a vivid and detailed lake, as well as animate Homer sinking to the bottom of the lake. Show runner Mike Scully commented that, \\"It's hard enough for us to come up with the ideas, but when Dominic and the animators can make it, it's really fantastic.\\" The episode guest starred Helen Hunt as Renee, Moe's girlfriend. Hunt has said she liked the design of her character, who was named after Hauge's wife. During the making of the episode, Hunt and Hank Azaria, who voices Moe, were dating. In an interview with People Magazine in 1998, Scully stated: \\"Hank and Helen got along so well it's hard to believe they are a real couple.\\" In July 1999, the couple married, but divorced in December 2000, after a long separation. Cultural references The title of the episode is a reference to the film Double Indemnity, which also had a plot involving an insurance scam. In the scenes where Moe and Renee are seen dating, the song \\"I'm a Believer\\" by The Monkees is playing. Other songs include \\"One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\\" by Amos Milburn and \\"Brick House\\" by the Commodores. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Dumbbell Indemnity\\" finished 25th in ratings for the week of February 23 - March 1, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 10.5, equivalent to approximately 10.3 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files and King of the Hill. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, enjoyed the episode, commenting: \\"A case perhaps of life reflecting art as guest star Helen Hunt is now married to Hank Azaria, who is, of course, Moe, which is rather nice as you can't help but feel sad that, by the end of this rather clever and charming episode, Moe has been unlucky in love once more.\\" In a 2006 article in USA Today, \\"Dumbbell Indemnity\\" was highlighted among the six best episodes of The Simpsons season 9, along with \\"Trash of the Titans\\", \\"The Last Temptation of Krust\\", \\"The Cartridge Family\\", \\"The Joy of Sect\\", and \\"Das Bus\\". IGN ranked Hail to the Chimp, the film Homer goes to see in the episode, as the seventh best fictional film within another work. Show runner Mike Scully greatly enjoyed the scene where Homer attempts to escape Moe's car when it is going down the cliff, and has said that it is one of his favorite scenes from the show.

As senior legal counsel in the provincial government of Tommy Douglas, he drafted the 1947 Saskatchewan Bill of Rights, the first such bill in the British Commonwealth. He established a successful private law practice in Regina in 1949 and argued numerous cases of constitutional law before the Supreme Court of Canada. He and his wife Jacqui distributed millions of dollars to support the arts, universities, and other charities in Regina, and also amassed \\"one of the most significant private collections of Inuit art in Canada\\". He was the recipient of many awards and honours, including the Order of Canada in 1981 and the Saskatchewan Order of Merit in 1997. Early life and education Morris Cyril Shumiatcher was born in Calgary, Alberta, to Abraham Isaac Shumiatcher (1890‚Äì1974), a lawyer, and his wife Luba (n√©e Lubinsky). He had one sister, Minuetta, a concert pianist. He was Jewish. After attending primary and secondary school in Calgary, he set his career sights on becoming a professor of English. Advised that his religion would restrict his employment opportunities, he pursued a legal education instead. He studied in Japan on a Rotary scholarship from 1940 to 1941 and earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1940 and Bachelor of Laws in 1941 at the University of Alberta. He received his Master of Laws in 1942 from the University of Toronto. He was the first candidate to be accepted into the new doctoral program in law at the University of Toronto in 1942, entitling him to the Rowell Scholarship. World War II intervened, however, and he served with the Royal Canadian Air Force as an air gunner from 1943 to 1945. He completed his doctorate in jurisprudence in 1945 under the supervision of Bora Laskin, submitting the doctoral thesis A Study in Canadian Administrative Law: The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Acts. He was admitted to the bars of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and the Northwest Territories. Career Shumiatcher portrait In 1946, he moved to Regina, Saskatchewan, at the invitation of Tommy Douglas to become Law Officer of the Attorney General. Afterwards he became the personal assistant to Douglas. He drafted several statutes, including the Farm Security Act and the Trade Union Act. He was the legal advisor for the Union of Saskatchewan Indians and chaired a July 1946 meeting between Treaty Indians and the provincial government. He continued to advocate for Indians with a 1967 article in Saturday Night magazine that criticized the government for restricting tribes to reservations rather than allowing them to own private property, and with the 1971 publication of his book Welfare: Hidden Backlash: A hard look at the welfare issue in Canada; what it has done to the Indian, what it could do to the rest of Canada. Shumiatcher authored the 1947 Saskatchewan Bill of Rights, which was the model for the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the Canadian Bill of Rights (1960). The bill ‚Äì the first of its kind in the British Commonwealth ‚Äì codified the rights of due process, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association, and freedom of the press, and included protections against discrimination. Shumiatcher included a protection against gender discrimination, but it did not appear in the final draft. In preparation for writing the bill, Shumiatcher referred to \\"social science and legal research by Canadian and American Jews of various ideological leanings\\". However, the bill lacked an enforcement mechanism, making it \\"more a symbol than an instrument for defending human rights\\". In 1948 he was appointed as King's Counsel in the Commonwealth of Nations, becoming the youngest person to hold that position. Shumiatcher left government employ in 1949 to start his own legal practice in Regina. Regarded as a \\"brilliant\\" lawyer, he specialized in labour, tax, and corporate law and argued numerous cases in constitutional law before the Supreme Court of Canada. His appeal on behalf of Eleanor Ellen Farr in Farr v. Farr (1984) led to changes in Canada's matrimonial property law. He represented Joe Borowski before the Supreme Court of Canada in the latter's 1980s challenge to the constitutionality of abortion law; the court declared the case moot in 1989. Other activities =Author and lecturer= Shumiatcher frequently lectured and wrote on \\"literature, the arts, philosophy, law, human rights and obligations, the monarchy, politics and international relations\\". He was regularly interviewed in the media and appeared on a current affairs daily radio program; The World in Focus television program; and Civil Liberties and the Law, a lecture series broadcast nationally by the CTV Television Network. =Philanthropist and art patron= Shumiatcher and his wife Jacqueline were prominent supporters of the arts community in Regina, distributing millions of dollars in support of symphonies, theatres, universities, art galleries, and other charities. Since his death in 2004, Jacqui continues to make donations in both their names. Their endowments include: *The Shumiatcher Open Stage at the University of Regina, also known as the Shu-Box, a teaching theatre with expandable seating from 134 to 162 *The Shumiatcher Sculpture Court, featuring Inuit art donated by the couple, and the Shumiatcher Theatre, both at the MacKenzie Art Gallery *The Shumiatcher Lobby and Shumiatcher Sandbox Series, both at the Globe Theatre *The Shumiatcher Pops Series at the Regina Symphony Orchestra *The Dr. Morris and Jacqui Shumiatcher Scholarship in Law, the annual lecture series \\"Law and Literature\\", and the Robert E. Bamford Memorial Award, at the University of Saskatchewan College of Law. *The Drs. Morris and Jacqui Shumiatcher Regina Book Award for the Saskatchewan Book Awards =Art collector= Shumiatcher began collecting art in his twenties; he returned from his study year in Japan in 1941 with \\"masks, woodblock prints and kimonos\\". In 1954 he visited Lac la Ronge, northern Saskatchewan, where he purchased four Inuit sculptures. After their marriage in 1955, he and his wife Jacqui amassed what was later termed \\"one of the most significant private collections of Inuit art in Canada\\". Their home included an extensive gallery displaying their acquisitions. In 2014 Jacqui donated 1,310 pieces valued at CAD$3 million ‚Äì including Inuit sculptures and paintings by the Regina Five ‚Äì to the University of Regina. Legal challenges, disbarment, and exoneration Shumiatcher's high profile in Western Canada, fueled by his successful law practice and prominent social status, made him the target of criticism in the legal world, which \\"perceived [him] as unconventional, flamboyant, and something of a gadfly\\". In 1962 Shumiatcher was charged with conspiracy to defraud the public as a result of advice he had given a corporate client, and was disbarred. Shumiatcher claimed he was the object of a vendetta by leading politicians and legal personalities whom he had offended. Many Saskatchewan judges supported him. In 1964 the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan struck down the conviction for conspiracy, citing \\"manifest error by the trial judge\\". The court also invalidated Shumiatcher's disbarment, but new allegations received by the Law Society of Saskatchewan prompted the latter group to suspend Shumiatcher's membership for six months beginning in September 1966. Shumiatcher filed a court challenge and in 1967 the Court of Appeal ruled against the Law Society's decision for lack of evidence. The Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear any further appeals, thus ending Shumiatcher's legal challenges. Affiliations and memberships Shumiatcher served as president of the Norman Mackenzie Art Gallery, the Regina Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Commonwealth Society, and the Duke of Edinburgh Award Committee for Saskatchewan. He sat on the board of directors of the Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts and of Beth Jacob Synagogue in Regina. He was also a member of the National Council of the Canadian Bar Association and was an honorary solicitor of the Regina Press Club. Honours and awards Shumiatcher served as an honorary consul general for Japan and Dean of the Consular Corps for Saskatchewan for 14 years. He was the recipient of numerous honours and awards on the provincial and government levels, including the Order of Canada (1981), the B'nai Brith Citizen of the Year (1991), the Canada 125 Medal (1992), the Distinguished Service Award of the Canadian Bar Association (1995), and the Saskatchewan Order of Merit (1996). He was honoured with life membership in the Monarchist League of Canada in 1992 and in the Regina Bar Association in 1997. Personal life Jacqui Shumiatcher In 1947 Jacqueline \\"Jacqui\\" Fanchette Clotilde Clay was hired as secretary to Shumiatcher during his employ as senior legal counsel in the provincial government; after leaving this position, she helped set up his private law practice. They married in April 1955. Jacqui established a managerial company to handle staff hires and office management for Morris' law firm. The couple were childless. They resided at 2520 College Avenue in Regina, purchasing in 1956 a two-story Picturesque Eclectic house originally owned by Maughan McCausland, also a lawyer. In 1979 they adjoined an adjacent one-story house to the property, creating one large structure. Like her husband, Jacqui was awarded the Saskatchewan Order of Merit in 2001 and was inducted into the Order of Canada in 2017. Shumiatcher died on September 23, 2004. His papers are held at the Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan. Bibliography Shumiatcher authored three books:  References Sources    * * . External links *\\"A Democratic Dilemma\\" by Morris C.

Biography  = Family and Early life = Rooftop view of Celle Albrecht Daniel Thaer was born in Celle, a neat little town in Hanover, on 14 May 1752. His father, Johann Friedrich Thaer, was physician to the Court, and born in Liebenwerda, in Saxony; his mother, Sophie Elisabeth, was the daughter of J. Saffe, receiver of rents and taxes of the district of Celle. Albert was the first born, and had three sisters, Christine, Albertine, and Wilhelmine, of which the first died in infancy, the second was married to Captain Schweppe, and the youngest to the well-known privy councillor, Doctor Jacobi.John Sinclair. \\"Memoir of Thaer\\" in: A.D. Thaer. The Principles of Agriculture, Volume 1. William Shaw and Cuthbert W. Johnson (tr.). Ridgway, 1844. p. i-xvi. At the University of G√∂ttingen he finished his medical studies, and afterwards practised medicine in his native place. In 1786, he married the daughter of a nobleman, one Miss Von Wellich.United States. Patent Office. \\"On Agricultural Schools,\\" Ex. Doc. No. 54. in: Annual Report of the Commissioner of Patents. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1848 p. 312-3 The garden attached to his house, where he amused himself with cultivating flowers, gave rise to his agricultural celebrity; the taste for the culture of flowers led him gradually to that of agriculture; he bought a larger lot of sixteen acres, and executed on it his plans. It was soon the attraction of everybody, for the collection of rare plants and beautiful walks, fine orchards, and the different kinds of clover and grass. His success in the culture of various plants, stimulated him to buy a more extensive tract of land. = Early career as Physician = About that time, just when he was at the point of giving up his profession and devoting his time to agriculture alone, he received from London his patent, as physician to his majesty George the Third. This honor came unexpectedly, and he could not withdraw himself at once from his profession, but began by degrees to resign his practice, and continued his favorite occupation, the improvement of agriculture, with the view of establishing an experimental farm. He paid great attention to the culture of herbage fodder, root crops, and especially potatoes; which latter root he most vehemently defended against its numerous adversaries and assailants. = Career as agriculturist = His work on English husbandry appeared soon after, and was well received in Germany and in England. His fame as an agriculturist who applied science to practice, spread over all Europe. His plan of establishing a school was at last executed, and attracted many visitors of distinction. The king of Prussia Frederick William III was exceedingly anxious to have Thaer's services, invited him to reside within his kingdom, and granted him the following advantages: # Nomination as a member of the Academy of Sciences; # A grant of four hundred acres of land; # The privilege of selling the land, and all the privileges attached to a landed estate belonging to a nobleman, in case he should buy another estate; # Protection to his academy; # Entire liberty of the press in regard to his Agricultural Journal; # Permission to practice his profession as a physician; # His nomination, as privy counsellor. These privileges and honors were too tempting. He accepted the king's offer, and left Celle for Berlin; took possession of the 400 acres; sold it immediately, and bought the present landed estates Moegelin, and obtained all the privileges of a nobleman. It was in June, 1804, that he took possession of Moegelin. The loss of his flocks by rot and the French wars, were great calamities, especially in the commencement of his operations; but he conquered all difficulties by perseverance; and in 1806 the academy was opened. Twenty pupils inscribed their names immediately; the number increased with every year. He distinguished himself in the improvement of wool; his flocks were superior to any in Prussia. His written works increased his fame, and the sovereigns of Russia, Prussia and many others sent him their orders of knighthood. He. purchased additional property for his younger son Albrecht Philipp Thaer, the later proprietor of Moegelin, who was entirely devoted to agricultural pursuits. = Death = Original Thear monument in the Agricultural faculty of Berlin. In the year 1828, he had a severe attack of rheumatism, and his health began to decline; in 1827, his eyesight failed entirely. His sufferings were great, but he bore them with fortitude and resignation, and at last, on 28 October 1828 in Wriezen, death put an end to his pains. Thaer is buried in his garden, opposite the family dwelling, on the shore of a small clear pond, among the trees which he planted himself, \\"his children,\\" as he called them. His tomb is under the eves of a chapel. No cold, huge block of marble tells you that here lies father Thaer; but above his grave rises a pyramid of flowers which with their fragrance arrest the attention of visitors, and point with their rich colored petals to the grave, where the man lies who loved them, and who spent his life among them, watching their mysterious habits, to catch a glimpse of the Great Mother's secret operations. Over his grave the ornaments of nature's rich temple mourn for their departed friend. His consort lies by his side surrounded by shrubs and trees. Nowadays there is a grave memorial in M√∂glin in Brandenburg, Germany, see image.  Work  Albrecht Thaer was the first Agricultural scientist, who arranged the existing facts and theory of agriculture in a proper system. His works are highly valued among all agriculturists, and in his time referred to as a magazine of solid truths. = Thaer's Agricultural School = The Albrecht-Thaer-Schule in Celle was founded by Thaer early 19th century. In 1802 Thaer had founded in Celle in the \\"Dammasch-Wiesen\\", the first German Agricultural Training Institute (today Thaer's Garden ). There among others he experimented with rotation to improve the yield. In 1804, he joined the Prussian service. In the same year he founded the first German Agricultural Academy (Agricultural Academy M√∂glin) in the manor M√∂glin. In 1819 the academy was renamed Royal Prussian Academy of agriculture. Among the professors were Georg Ernst Wilhelm Crome from 1808 until 1813, Franz K√∂rte from 1814 to 1830, and Philipp Albrecht Thaer from 1830 until its inclusion in the Berlin Agricultural Training Institute in 1861. Park and manor house in M√∂glin in Brandenburg, Germany In the year 1804, the King of Prussia had invited Thaer to settle in his dominions, and gave him the estate of Mogelin, situated about forty-five miles from Berlin, consisting of 1,200 acres, to manage as a pattern farm. He erected extensive buildings for himself, three professors, a variety of tradesmen, and the requisite agricultural buildings. The three professors were ‚Äî one for Mathematics, Chemistry and Geology, one for Veterinary Knowledge, and a third for Botany and Entomology; an experienced agriculturist was also engaged, whose office it was to point out to the pupils the mode of applying the sciences to the practical business of husbandry.William Shaw \\"Preparing for publication a translation of Von Thaer's Principles of Agriculture\\" in: The Farmer's and General Fire and Life Insurance, and Loan and Annuity Institution, Volume 2 1850. p. 12 The course commerced in September. During the winter months, the time is occupied in mathematics, and the first six books of Euclid were studied: and in the summer, the geometrical knowledge was practically applied to the measurement of land, timber, buildings, and other objects. The first principles of chemistry were unfolded. By a good but economical apparatus, various experiments were made, both on a large and small scale. For the larger experiments, the brew-house and stilLhouse with their respective fixtures were found highly useful.John Claudius Loudon. An Encyclop√¶dia of Agriculture. Lemma \\"Agriculture in Germany\\". Longmans, Green, 1825/1871. p. 91 Much attention was paid to the analysation of various soils, and the different kinds, with the relative quantity of their component parts, were arranged with great order and regularity. The classification was made with neatness, by having the specimens of soil arranged in order, and distinguished by different colours. Thus, for instance, if the basis of the soil is sandy, the glass has a cover of yellow paper; if the next predominating earth is calcareous, the glass has a white ticket on its side; if it was red clay, it had a red ticket; if blue clay, a blue one. Over these tickets, others, of a smaller size, indicate by their colour the third greatest quantity of the particular substance contained in the soil. This matter may appear to many more ingenious than useful, and savouring too much of the German habit of generalising. The classification of Von Thaer was, however, as much adopted, and as commonly used on the large estates in Germany, where exact statistical accounts were kept, as the classification of Linnaeus in natural history is throughout the civilised world. There was a large botanic garden, arranged on the system of the Swedish naturalist, kept in excellent order, with all the plants labelled, and the Latin as well as German names. A herbarium, with a good collection of dried plants which was constantly increasing, wa open to the examination of the pupils, as well as skeletons of the different animals, and casts of their several parts, which must have been of great use in veterinary pursuits. Models of agricultural implements, especially of ploughs, were preserved in a museum, which was stored as well with such as were common in Germany, as with those used in England, or other countries. The various implements used on the farm were all made by smiths, wheelers, and carpenters, residing round the institution; the workshops were open to the pupils, and they were encouraged by attentive inspection, to become masters of the more minute branches of the economy of an estate. The sum paid by each pupil was four hundred rix-dollars annually, besides which they provide their own beds and breakfasts. In that time in that country, such an expense precluded the admission of all but youths of good fortune. Each has a separate apartment. They were very well behaved young men, and their conduct to each other, and to the professors, was polite, even to punctilio. = Principles of Agriculture, 1809-12 = Thaer's most quoted book is the four volumes Grunds√§tze der rationellen Landwirthschaft (1809‚Äì1812), which was translated into English in 1844 as The Principles of Agriculture by William Shaw and Cuthbert W. Johnson. The humus theory described in this work still received acceptance in the Modern Period (1800‚Äì1860). Von Thaer's \\"Principles of Agriculture\\" contain the result of his experience through a series of years. The work embraces the theory of the soil, the clearing of land, plowing, manuring, and irrigation, hedges and fences, management of meadow and pasture lands; the cultivation of wheat, rye, corn, oats, barley, buckwheat, hops, tobacco, clover, and all the varieties of grasses; the economy of kine stock, breeding and feeding; the management of the dairy, and the use of manures, and the various systems of cultivation, keeping journals and farm records. In brief, it is a complete cyclopedia or circle of practical agriculture.Isaac Smith Homans. Hunt's Merchants' Magazine and Commercial Review, Volume 36, 1857. p. 272 By the time the book was translated, in 1833, it had been frequently expressed by persons conversant with Foreign agricultural publications, that Von Thaer's Work should not have been translated into English. It was admitted by some of the first agricultural writers, who have read the work in the original language, to contain a great mass of valuable practical matter. = Conception of the agriculturist = Von Thaer's Agricultural School, Philipp Albrecht Thaer acknowledge in the 1850 programme of his agricultural school, that the object of his institution is to educate capable superintendents, or directors for large estates: but that he cannot call anyone a capable director, who has only the skill to carry out a mode of farming in an imitation or borrowed manner: that he understands by a capable director, a man who can, with a clear discernment, enhance the value of a landed estate entrusted to him so far as circumstances of condition and situation allow it.United States. Patent Office (1848; p. 313-6) A capable director will propose the object to be attained and which may be profitable, prudently, circumspectly, with an exact regard to all the internal and outward relations; and then, prepared with practised eye and tact, rise from one step to another, firm and sure, to the proposed height of culture and productiveness. That in such a course of operations, every visionary scheme and every restless change from one thing to another is to be avoided, is self-evident. But if we now enquire further, as to the material and elements which are considered necessary to educate anyone to such a capacity, it is needful first‚Äîthat the agriculturist should understand the general rudiments of all industrial intercourse and those also which belong to the general economy of the state; and these so much the more, as he will always be dependent upon the same. He is obliged, therefore, to fit himself to discern how his own landed estate is related to the whole country; how its politico-social relations and the conjectures of trade may check or aid, operate favorably or disastrously upon his enterprises and their results. Hence he can easily learn to judge, also, how the particular situation of a farm, the nearness or distance of the market, the thoroughfares of trade, the exchange of manufactures, and the present value of money represented by the rate of interest, and, also, by that of the productiveness of mercantile or industrial capital, may impart a greater or less value to his landed property. These will, therefore, be particularly considered, in the exposition of the general doctrine of trade, which treats of the value of capital, the price of products, and the cost of labor. While thus the agriculturist is led, as it were, from without to the internal economy of landed property, he must further-be so prepared, that he can judge not only of the soil on the same, and the materials contained in it, but also the given degree of richness, and the fit culture. It cannot also escape him, what influences the circumstances of the region exert on vegetable and animal development; and still less ought he to be unacquainted with the physical and moral circumstances of the inhabitants of a country under his inspection and examination. If we imagine, finally, the agriculturist as in the conduct and management of the farm himself, then we wish him furnished, not only with knowledge but also with ability. He must not only be mentally educated, to conceive an idea, but also be practically certain and skilled in executing it. So, that the thought may be reduced to reality, he must be possessed of a rapid, sharp, sure perception and skill, and with an extensive knowledge of the particular business, instruments, and modes of operation, in the practice of his profession. The agriculturist must, as much as is possible, unite in his own person, the knowledge of art and the manual skill of his branch of business. The more this is the case‚Äîthe clearer view he can obtain over the whole of the farming operations‚Äîso much deeper insight \\"will he have into the particular parts of the same, into the relation which they bear to each other, the agencies subordinate to himself, and the instruments of the whole system. To look through this system correctly and regulate it, the agriculturist needs only the aid of a properly arranged and carefully executed' mode of keeping accounts: for as, according to the expression of Thaer the elder, \\"Account- keeping is the A B C of every trade,\\" so it is wholly and especially the alphabet of agricultural enterprise. Through it, only, the results obtained have a certainty, the relation of the various branches to the whole are represented by numbers; the cause and effect, the means and result, the deficiency and the surplus, are reduced to figures and expressed in money- value. As the agriculturist is, and continues in an always progressive intercourse with nature and its life; so those scenes are of aid to him, which give him an insight into the powers of nature, its influence on the success or failure of agricultural enterprise, the facility of developing these powers and influences of nature so as to regulate them according to his own wishes as far as it can be done. Hence, it follows, that the knowledge drawn from the domain of the natural sciences ought not to be wanting, in the complete education of. the future director: [steward, or manager, or overseer, as we call him in this country.] As it has been shown how the material and elements must act together, to educate a thorough and an able agriculturist it seems to us, also, that we have, at the same time, shown that while we have in view, as the immediate object of our school, this forming of thorough farmers, we must not limit the object within a narrow space; but make the training which accomplishes the general purpose, such as will enable a young man of a good preliminary education, sound parts and due application, to search still farther and acquire a high degree of information in this trade and science, by books and words.  Commemoration  Banknote of 10 Reichsmark, 1929 The Germans paid due homage to this great man while living, and have not overlooked, as to posthumous honors, him who had rendered such great services to his country and to humanity in general. His statue stands among those of all the great men of Germany. There are memorials to Thaer in Leipzig, Berlin (Schinkelplatz), Celle, Halle, M√∂glin, and Kada≈à (in front of the agriculture school). The regular German Banknote of 10 Reichsmark, issued in 1929, carried the portrait of Albrecht Daniel Thaer. It was valid until the issue of the Deutsche Mark on 21 June 1948 after WW2.

The last component of the program was canceled in July 2011.Brannen, Kate, \\"Army kills off MULE unmanned vehicle\\", Military Times, 15 August 2011.  Timeline  In $5.5 million, 18-month contract awarded July 2002 the Department of Defense selected Boeing Integrated Defense Systems to prototype a six-wheeled vehicle, then called \\"Stinger.\\" Boeing's partner, Carnegie Mellon University's National Robotics Engineering Consortium, said it anticipated the armed vehicle could be fielded by 2008. Description The Multifunctional Utility/Logistics and Equipment Vehicle was a 2.5-ton Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) that was developed to support dismounted and air assault operations. The MULE was sling-loadable under military rotorcraft and featured a common chassis. As the program's centerpiece, the Common Mobility Platform (CMP) chassis provided mobility built around an advanced propulsion and articulated suspension system. This system gave the MULE the ability to negotiate complex terrain, obstacles, and gaps that a dismounted squad would encounter. The MULE's unique, highly advanced 6x6 independent articulated suspension, coupled with in-hub motors powering each wheel, provided extreme mobility in complex terrain, far exceeding that of vehicles utilizing more conventional suspension systems. It could climb at least a 1-meter step traverse side slopes greater than 40 percent, ford water to depths over 0.5 meters and overpass obstacles as high as 0.5 meters, while compensating for varying payload weights and center of gravity locations.

AKF seeks to provide long-term solutions to problems of poverty, hunger, illiteracy and ill health in the poorest parts of South and Central Asia, Eastern and Western Africa, and the Middle East. In these regions, the needs of rural communities in mountainous, coastal and resource poor areas are given particular attention. The Foundation's activities often reinforce the work of other sister agencies within the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN). While these agencies are guided by different mandates pertaining to their respective fields of expertise (the environment, culture, microfinance, health, education, architecture, rural development), their activities are often coordinated with one another in order to \\"multiply\\" the overall effect that the Network has in any given place or community. AKF also collaborates with local, national and international partners in order to bring about sustainable improvements of life in the 19 countries in which it works. The Foundation's head office is located in Geneva, Switzerland. Areas of focus The Foundation concentrates its resources on selected issues in health, education, rural development, environment and the strengthening of civil society. Seeking innovative approaches to generic problems, it tries to identify solutions that can be adapted to conditions in many different regions and replicated. Cross- cutting issues that are also addressed by the Foundation include human resource development, community participation, and gender and development. Funding and grant making The Aga Khan Foundation is the principal grant- making agency for social development within the Aga Khan Development Network. Grants are normally given to local organizations interested in testing new solutions, in learning from experience and in being agents of lasting change. These organizations must share the Foundation's and Aga Khan Development Network's goals in their specific areas of focus. If no established group exists, the Foundation occasionally creates new organizations to tackle particularly important problems. The Aga Khan provides the Foundation with regular funding for administration as well as making contributions to its endowment. The Ismaili community contributes volunteers, time, professional services and substantial financial resources. Other funding sources include income from investments and grants from government, institutional and private sector partners, as well as donations from individuals around the world. One programme series funded by the Foundation was the BBC World News television series Architects on the Frontline, which was about entries to the Aga Khan Award for Architecture competition, and was criticized by the media watchdog Ofcom for breaking United Kingdom broadcasting rules; viewers were not informed that the series, which praised the competition, was sponsored content. Awards and recognition Among other recognition for its work, the Foundation received the 2005 Award for Most Innovative Development Project from the Global Development Network for the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP). The AKRSP has successfully been replicated to form the Rural Support Programmes Network in Pakistan.Global Development Network: Global Development Awards at www.gdnet.org Geographic focus The Foundation normally intervenes where it has a strong volunteer base. It is currently active in the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Canada, Egypt, India, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, Mozambique, Pakistan, Portugal, Switzerland, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Uganda, United Kingdom, and United States.

He first appeared in the 1998 video game Guilty Gear, as the main character and namesake. In the series, he is a bounty hunter who has dedicated his life to the destruction of Gears, a race of magical bioweapons that plunged the world into a hundred-year war known as the Crusades. He was once a member of the Sacred Order of the Holy Knights, and this appearance was featured in another playable character named . Sol Badguy, whose real name is Frederick Bulsara, was named after Freddie Mercury's nickname, \\"Mr. Bad Guy\\", by Daisuke Ishiwatari, the series' creator, who also provided his voice in the video games. Despite being criticized as a generic fictional character, video game reviewers compared his relationship with his main rival, Ky Kiske, to that of other notable video game characters. Sol's fighting abilities and the choice of his name were also the subject of reviewers, receiving both praise and criticism. Creation and design Creator Daisuke Ishiwatari designed Sol in many ways as his alter ego, and also recorded Sol's in-game voice (the voice actor for Guilty Gear X2's story mode and drama CDs, however, is done by Hikaru Hanada). Ishiwatari's favorite band is Queen, and he put in Sol's profile that he is a fan of Queen, and named Sol Badguy, whose real name is Frederick (or Freddie for short), after Freddie Mercury, whose nickname was \\"Mr. Bad Guy\\". Appearances Introduced in the first installment of the series (1998), Frederick was one of the lead scientists of the Gear project, as well as being the prototypical Gear, dating from over a hundred years before the events of the Guilty Gear games. As a prototype, he is immune to the orders of Commander Gears. He was personally acquainted with Asuka R. Kreuz (whom typically known as That Man) prior to the Crusades. As Frederick, Sol created the \\"Outrage\\", which he called a supreme Anti-Gear weapon. The Outrage has eight components called \\"Jinki\\" (Godlike Weapons), which greatly amplify their wielders' magical ability. Later, he was himself recruited into the order, as a bounty hunter named Sol Badguy. Sol took part in the Crusades, during which he was a member of the Sacred Order of Holy Knights (Seikishidan), acquiring the nickname . However, he later became disenchanted with the methods of the Sacred Order, and fled the order, taking with him the . The theft earned him Ky Kiske's enmity. In 2175, Sol faced Justice directly. During the fight, which Justice won, she discovered that Sol was a Gear. Justice attempted to assert her power as a Commander Gear to control Sol, but was unable to do so. Exploiting her confusion and weakness from the fight, the Holy Order, led by Ky, sealed Justice away, bringing the war to an end. However, a Gear named Testament began a plan to free Justice, and to stop it, the Union of Nations held a tournament. The canon stated that Sol was the winner of the Tournament, which also resulted in Justice discovering that Sol was, in fact, Frederick. Justice, in her dying words, commented that she wished that \\"... the three of us ...\\" could talk one last time, and Sol swore to kill Asuka. In Guilty Gear X (2000), Sol has three endings, all of which involve a fight against Dizzy, who has a half-million dollar bounty on her head. However, he spares her life in all of them, losing against her in his second ending, and judging that she is not a threat to the world in the other two. In the subsequent game, Guilty Gear X2 (2002), his story-line involved chasing down I-No. In his first ending, his defeat of I-No led to a direct confrontation with Asuka, who casually deflected all of Sol's attacks, saying that Sol was needed because soon a greater battle than the Crusades will occur. In Sol's second ending, Slayer informed him of the Post-War Administration Bureau's interest in Dizzy. In the third ending, he fought Dizzy, who had been possessed by Necro, after I-No knocked her off the Mayship, and sent Dizzy on her way to meet Johnny and May. In Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus (2008), Sol had two endings. In one, I-No threw him back in time to fight his past self, Order-Sol. After both are weakened from the battle, I-No reappeared to murder Order-Sol, which, in turn, caused Sol's present form to cease existing. In his other ending, the same set of events played out, but Sol's present form, strangely, is unaffected by his past self's death. After escaping the time rift, Ky confronted and engaged him in battle. After the fight, Sol and Ky finally settled their differences and went their separate ways, with Ky asking Sol to promise that they will meet again. Though it was referenced in both Sol and Ky's endings, only Sol's told the events directly after the battle, which implied that Sol was the victor. In Guilty Gear 2: Overture (2007), Sol Badguy took in a young man named Sin as his apprentice, and traveled the world with him as bounty hunters. During their journey, he met Izuna, who told him that a man called Vizel was seeking out and destroying Gears, by order of Valentine, and that his next target was the kingdom of Illyria. Sol, Sin, and Izuna go to Illyria and find Ky Kiske trapped with a binding spell. With Dr. Paradigm's help they were able to release him. Eventually, they captured Valentine, who transformed herself into a monster. Sol fought her, and after the fight, he found himself in a white space, unable to return. However, he was confronted by That Man, who confirmed that Valentine was a copy of Aria, Sol's former lover. Sol was returned to the real world, where he reunited with his allies. In Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN- (2014), Sol continued his journeys with Sin when Ramlethal Valentine declared war on humanity. Working alongside Ky, Sin, Leo Whitefang, and Elphelt Valentine, Sol fought to stop the Conclave from using the Cradle to resurrect Justice and destroy humanity. In the end, Sol and his allies were able to stop Justice from reviving, but Elphelt betrayed them and tried to kill them. She was eventually taken to the Backyard, and Sol, Sin and Ramlethal set out to find her. In REVELATOR (2016), Sol was confronted by Raven, who told him that That Man needed his help in preventing Elphelt from merging with Justice. Before the final battle against Ariel, Sol is in trouble in attempting to claim he is not related to Dizzy, due to her mother, Justice was once Sol‚Äôs deceased lover Aria, when his allies begin to theorize his connection with the two said female Gears, even cause Dizzy‚Äôs husband, Ky screaming by this supposed revelation. After Ariel is defeat, where Jack-O took Elphelt‚Äôs place and becoming a reincarnated Aria, Sol finally reveal to his allies of That Man‚Äôs real name as ‚ÄúAsuka‚Äù. In the epilogue storyline added in REV 2 (2017), he and Asuka wants a score to settle with each other, sometimes after the latter turned himself in. At time when Asuka turned himself to the government for the crimes he did not want to commit, Sol first visits Kiske manor where Ky and his family, including Elphelt and Ramlethal discussing about Sol, while also having a good news of about Dizzy‚Äôs reputation to the public. It was revealed between XXAC and Overture that Sol even treated Sin a ‚Äúsugar water‚Äù nearby the river they passed by and give a tip to the boy how it made, much to Ky and Dizzy‚Äôs confusions. As Ky noticed Sol‚Äôs fighting intent, they begin to discuss far away outside the manor privately. While recalling their day as knights of Holy Orders, Sol mocks Ky, claiming the latter if he was an unworthy king, would that mean Ky unable to protect his beloved Dizzy from being remained outcasted by human, angering Ky, who manage to overpowers Sol. Ky exploits that Sol has a score to settle with Asuka sometimes later, asking him about it. He was also a playable character in the spin-off games Guilty Gear Petit (2001), Isuka (2003), Dust Strikers (2006), and Judgment (2006). =Order-Sol= Order-Sol is an alternative past version of the original character. Sol was once a part of the Sacred Order of the Holy Knights, and Order-Sol is a take on what Sol looked like and how he fought during that time. This form also shows a glimpse of Sol's true Gear form when performing one of his special moves. He first appeared as a playable character in Guilty Gear XX Slash (2005), and subsequently appeared in Guilty Gear XX Accent Core (2006), Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus (2008), and Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R (2012). In addition to being playable, Order-Sol also appeared as a final boss of Guilty Gear XX Slashs Arcade Mode. Reception In a 2013 poll conducted by Arc System Works, Sol was voted as the second most popular character from the series. Daisuke Ishiwatari cited Sol as his favorite character several times. William Usher from Cinema Blend found Sol to be one of his favorite characters \\"... of all time, for any game\\". He has been praised for his last name's loftiness by many sources, with Eurogamer calling him \\"... the best-named videogame character of all time.\\" On the other hand, Hardcore Gaming 101 said \\"... his name is ridiculous\\", 1UP.com ranked him sixth in their \\"Top 10 Most Ridiculous Character Names\\", while Emily Gera of VideoGamer.com included him in a list of \\"Oddest Character Names in Games\\", and GamesRadar's David Houghton placed him among the \\"... 25 most gloriously stupid character names in video games\\". Despite calling him one of the cast's \\"... more generic characters ...\\", IGN commented that Sol has a \\"... standard speed and versatility ...\\", and considered Sol \\"cool\\" because he is a good character to play with for newcomers, as he is \\"... one of the easier characters to get acquainted [sic] with.\\" Thunderbolt Games listed his Dust Loop as one of \\"Fighting Games' Most Infamous Combos\\", and stated it is \\"... the biggest crowd upsetting combo in X2\\", as well as \\"... one of history's most boring and abused combos\\". On the other hand, GamesRadar's \\"Top 7\\" named him the fifth best character in fighting games of all time, adding, \\"Sol and his array of fiery attacks are emblematic ...\\", and calling Dust Loop, \\"... one of fighting games' most iconic combos\\". Similarly, he was ranked 34th in Complexs list of \\"Most Dominant Fighting Game Characters\\". In Game Informers 2009 list of the \\"Top Ten Best Fighting Game Characters\\", Sol placed sixth. The option of his alternate form, Order-Sol, was also praised by IGN that remarked he \\"... is utterly fantastic and makes a great addition to the cast\\". In contrast, Lucas Sullivan from GamesRadar described him as a \\"... bit like Evil Ryu: just different enough from the original to justify your inclusion in a limited roster\\". His relation with Ky Kiske has also been commended by reviewers. Todd Ciolek from Anime News Network described it as a \\"true relationship\\", and IGN writer, Ryan Clements, called them a legendary pair, IGN's Vincent Ingenito said \\"Ky and Sol might very well have been the next Ryu and Ken ... or at least the next Scorpion and Sub-Zero\\". Writing for GameSpy, Benjamin Turner commented that they \\"... are the closest you'll get to a Ken and Ryu, but they look approximately a thousand times cooler.\\" On the same subject, Clements, however, said their clashes were \\"... great melodrama\\".

Formally, the person who directly draws the funds (\\"the payee\\") instructs his or her bank to collect (i.e., debit) an amount directly from another's (\\"the payer's\\") bank account designated by the payer and pay those funds into a bank account designated by the payee. Before the payer's banker will allow the transaction to take place, the payer must have advised the bank that he or she has authorized the payee to directly draw the funds. It is also called pre- authorized debit (PAD) or pre-authorized payment (PAP). After the authorities are set up, the direct debit transactions are usually processed electronically. Direct debits are typically used for recurring payments, such as credit card and utility bills, where the payment amounts vary from one payment to another. However, when the authorization is in place, the circumstances in which the funds are drawn as well as the dates and amounts are a matter of agreement between the payee and payer, with which the bankers are not concerned. In countries where setting up authorization is easy enough, direct debits can also be used for irregular payments, such as for mail order transactions or at a point of sale. The payer can cancel the authorization for a direct debit at any time, and the banker can decline to carry out a debit if the transaction would breach the terms of the bank account out of which payment is to be made, for example if it were to cause the account to overdraw. (Banking law does not authorize a bank to alter the payment amount.) A direct debit instruction differs from a direct deposit and standing order instruction, which are initiated by the payer. A standing order involves fixed payment amounts paid periodically, while a direct debit can be of any amount and can be casual or periodic. They also should not be confused with a continuous payment authority, where the payee collects money whenever it feels it is owed. Direct debits are available in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Direct debits are made under each country's rules, and are usually restricted to domestic transactions in those countries. An exception in this respect is the Single Euro Payments Area which allows for Euro-denominated cross-border (and domestic) direct debits since November 2010. In the United States, direct debits are processed through the Automated Clearing House network. Authorization A direct debit instruction must in all cases be supported by some sort of authorization for the payee to collect funds from the payer's account. There are generally two methods to set up the authorization: One method involves only the payer and the payee, with the payer authorizing the payee to collect amounts due on his or her account. However, the payer can instruct his or her bank to return any direct debit note without giving a reason. In that event, the payee has to pay all fees for the transaction and may eventually lose his or her ability to initiate direct debits if this occurs too often. However, it still requires all the account holders (not merely the payer) to watch statements and request returns if necessary, unless they have instructed their bank to block all direct debits. The other method requires the payer to instruct his or her bank to honour direct debit notes from the payee. The payee is then notified that he or she is now authorised to initiate direct debit transfers from the payer. While this is more secure in theory, it can also mean for the payer that it is harder to return debit notes in the case of an error or dispute. Direct debit in different countries =Europe= In Europe, the SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) and SEPA Credit Transfer payment schemes are available in each SEPA country for payments within the Eurozone.EU Regulation 260/2012 SEPA Direct Debit initially worked alongside national direct debit schemes until 1 August 2014. From that date, only SEPA Direct Debit was permitted for collecting euro-denominated payments in the EU. In October 2016, SDD and IBAN became the mandatory methods for euro transfers in all of the EU and EEA, but not mandatory for transfers in other currencies. =United Kingdom= Direct Debit is a payment method for recurring payments in the UK. It is the third most popular payment method in the UK, after cash and debit card, according to Payments UK. Bacs Payment Schemes Limited is the organisation with responsibility for the Direct Debit scheme. Direct Debit was invented by Alastair Hanton while he was working at Unilever as a way of collecting payments more efficiently. It commenced operation, as a paper-based system, in 1964. Direct Debit accounts for the payment of 73% of household bills and almost nine out of ten British adults have at least one Direct Debit commitment. In fact, in 2015 nearly 3.9 billion Direct Debits were processed, representing a year-on-year increase of 239 million which surpasses the previous record for annual growth of 161 million, set in 2004. 4.07 billion Direct Debits were processed in 2016, an increase of 4.9% from 2015. Payments UK predicts the figure is expected to rise to 4.4 billion by 2026. Authorisation To set up payments by Direct Debit, the payer must complete a Direct Debit Instruction to the merchant. This instruction contains bank-approved wording that makes it clear the payer is setting up an ongoing authority for the merchant to debit their account. The interface for completing the Direct Debit Instruction is controlled by the merchant, who then sends the data from the form to the customer's bank, via Bacs. The UK Direct Debit scheme rules allow for Direct Debit Instructions to be completed in several ways: * paper-based forms, which require a signature * over the telephone using a formal script to collect all the required information * online, using an online application form which has been approved by a bank * through other interactive services, where the interface has been approved by a bank Guarantee All UK payments collected by Direct Debit are covered by the Direct Debit Guarantee, which is provided by the UK's banks and building societies. Under the guarantee a payer is entitled to a full and immediate refund in the event of an error in the payment of a Direct Debit from their account. Where an error has occurred, refunds are paid immediately by the payer's bank, who will then attempt to recover the money from the merchant's bank, who in turn will attempt to recover the money charged back from the merchant. Under the Direct Debit scheme rules, merchants have very few grounds to challenge a charge-back generated under the Direct Debit Guarantee. Instead, they can pursue any payments which they believe have been incorrectly refunded to the payer directly through the small claims court. Access Before a company or organisation can collect payment by Direct Debit they need to be approved by a bank, or use a commercial bureau to collect direct debit payments on their behalf. This approval process ensures the company will be able to operate within the direct debit scheme rules and maintain the integrity of the scheme. If a large number of customers complain about direct debits set up by a particular service user then the service user may lose its ability to set up direct debits. Dormancy Any direct debit instruction that has not been used to collect funds for over 13 months is automatically cancelled by the customer's bank (this is known as a \\"dormancy period\\"). This can cause problems when the mandate is used infrequently, for instance, taking a payment to settle the bill for a seldom- used credit card. If the credit card company has not collected a payment using the Direct Debit mandate for over 13 months the mandate may have been cancelled as dormant without the customer's knowledge, and the direct debit claim will fail. Fraud The problem of direct debit fraud is extensive according to research by Liverpool Victoria Insurance which reveals that over 97,000 Britons have fallen victim to criminals setting up fraudulent direct debits from their accounts. An average of ¬£540 goes missing before the customer notices. Direct debit payment fraud in 2010 accounted for around 10.6% of all identity fraud cases. The extent of direct debit scamming is set to grow to 41,000 cases a year by 2013, equating to a 57% rise. However, the problem is exacerbated by some of the banks themselves for failing to implement any controls which prevent companies or fraudsters taking monies from business and consumer accounts. The problem of cancelled and obsolete direct debits being wrongfully revived or re-implemented is estimated to cost UK consumers ¬£385 million in 2010. For those customers who find out, it takes them on average four months to notice. Although no specific figures were collected it appears a substantial number of people lose considerable amounts of money annually because the obsolete direct debit is neither noticed nor recovered. On 7 January 2008, Jeremy Clarkson found himself the subject of direct debit fraud after publishing his bank account and sort code details in his column in The Sun to make the point that public concern over the 2007 UK child benefit data scandal was unnecessary. He wrote, \\"All you'll be able to do with them is put money into my account. Not take it out. Honestly, I've never known such a palaver about nothing\\". Someone then used these details to set up a ¬£500 direct debit to the charity Diabetes UK. In his next Sunday Times column, Clarkson wrote, \\"I was wrong and I have been punished for my mistake.\\"  Training  Businesses and organisations collecting payments through Direct Debit are instructed by Bacs to take mandatory training. Whether businesses are collecting independently or through a bureau, their relevant staff need to understand the fundamentals of the payment method. Courses are available through Bacs or through accredited external training. There are only four recognised companies in the UK providing Bacs accredited training: Accountis (D+H), Bottomline Technologies, Clear Direct Debit and SmartDebit. = Canada = In Canada, direct debit payments are often referred to as Pre-Authorized Debits (PADs). PADs work over a computerized network through Payment Canada‚Äôs federally-secured Automated Clearing Settlement System (ACHSS). This network connects all of Canada‚Äôs financial institutions. = Germany = In Germany, banks generally have been providing direct debit (elektronisches Lastschriftverfahren (ELV), \\"Lastschrift\\", Bankeinzug) using both methods since the advent of so-called Giro accounts in the 1950s. The Einzugserm√§chtigung (\\"direct debit authorisation\\") just requires the customer to authorize the payee to make the collection. This can happen in written form, orally, by e-mail or through a web interface set up by the payee. Although organisations are generally required not to instruct their banks to make unauthorised collections, this is usually not verified by the banks involved. Customers can instruct their bank to return the debit note within at least six weeks. This method is very popular within Germany as it allows quick and easy payments, and it is suited even for one-time payments. A customer might just give the authorisation at the same time she or he orders goods or services from an organisation. Compared to payments by credit cards, which allow similar usage, bank fees for successful collections are much lower. Often retailers such as supermarkets will process Girocards as direct debit (ELV) transactions after performing a real-time risk analysis when the card is swiped. This is possible because the bank account number and routing code of the giro account form part of every Girocard's card number (PAN), similar to early 1990s 19 digit Switch card numbers. p. 13-14. The customer agrees to the direct debit by signing the back of the receipt, which normally contains a long contractual text that also allows the retailer to contact the customer's bank and get their address in the case the debit is returned (\\"R√ºcklastschrift\\"). Direct debits are practically free for the retailer, allowing them to save the Girocard interchange fees (approx. 0.3%) that would be associated with PIN based transactions, but incur a higher risk as the payment can be returned for any reason for up to 45 days. Therefore, they are used usually for returning customers that have already had successful Girocard (PIN-verified) transactions at the same store or are purchasing low-risk or small-ticket items. To prevent abuse, account holders must watch their bank statements and ask their bank to return unauthorised (or wrong) debit notes. As fraudulent direct debit instructions are easily traced, abuse is rare. However, there can be issues when the amount billed and collected is incorrect or unexpectedly large. There have also been cases of fraudulent direct debit where the defrauders tried to collect very small individual sums from large numbers of accounts, in the hope that most account holders would be slow to raise an issue about such small sums, giving the defrauders enough time to withdraw the collected money and disappear. The Abbuchungsauftrag (\\"posting off\\") requires the customer to instruct his or her bank to honour debit notes from the organisation. Direct debits made with this method are verified by the customer's bank and therefore can not be returned. As it is less convenient, it is rarely used, usually only in business-to-business relationships. =Netherlands= In the Netherlands, as in Germany, an account holder can authorize a company to collect direct debit payments, without notifying the bank. This process is very common, with as many as 45% of all banking transactions conducted via direct debit. A transaction can be ongoing, or one time only. For both types collecting organizations must enter into a direct debit (automatische incasso) contract with their bank. For each transaction the name and account number of the account holder must be provided. The collecting organisation can then collect from any account, provided there is enough money in the account and no block is set against direct debit from the collecting organisation. Transactions can be contested, depending on the type of transaction, time since the transaction and the basis of dispute. Authorized transactions of the ongoing type can be recalled directly via the bank of the account holder within the 56 days (8 weeks) since the transaction, with the exception of transactions relating to games of chance and perishables. Authorized one-time only transactions can be recalled via the bank within 5 days. Unauthorized transactions can be contested via the bank within a limited time period after the transaction. Another security measure is a \\"selective block\\" whereby the customer can instruct the bank to disallow direct debits to a specified account number. Blanket blocks are also available. =Poland= In Poland, direct debit is operated by KIR (Krajowa Izba Rozliczeniowa) and participating banks as one of the functionalities of the Elixir clearing system. The payer has to authorize the payee by filling, signing and submitting a standardized paper form in two copies. One copy, after filling in payee details and a customer identification number, is sent by the payee to the payer's bank, which verifies the signature. From now on, the payee may debit the payer's account. Since 24 Oct 2012 it is also possible to submit such authorization through the payer's bank, often also online. The payer can: * Cancel any direct debit transaction:  within 56 calendar days - individuals,  within 5 working days - businesses and other organizations. * Suspend authorization so future direct debit transactions are blocked. * Revoke authorization at any time either online or by submitting a paper form to the bank. In case of cancelling a transaction, funds are immediately returned to the payer's account. Interest is also adjusted as if the transaction never happened. Collecting fees through direct debit is supported mostly by companies such as telecom, insurance and utility companies and banks themselves but it is not widely used by consumers because of the bureaucracy involved in setting direct debits up. =Ireland= The direct debit system in Ireland was previously operated by the Irish Payment Services Organisation (IPSO) until its integration with the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) in 2014, forming the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BFPI). Direct debit instructions can be given in writing, by telephone or online. There are protections for the holder of the account being debited in the event of a dispute.Guide to the Irish direct debit system The Irish payment system was replaced by the SEPA Direct Debit Core Scheme (SDD) following the conversion of all legacy credit transfer and direct debit systems to the Eurozone-wide SEPA system on 1 February 2014. = Denmark = Direct debit is preferred payment method for recurring household payments in Denmark. The service, launched back in the early seventies, is called \\"Betalingsservice\\" and is used by about 96% of the Danish households. =Japan= Direct debit is a very common payment option in Japan. When signing up for a service, such as telephone, a customer is usually asked to enter their bank details on the service submission form, to set up for automatic payments, and the company they are signing up to will take care of the rest. Sometimes, but not always, the customer is offered the possibility to enter credit card details instead of bank account details, to have the money directly debited from credit card instead of bank account. =Malaysia= In Malaysia, the direct debit system is available via the product known as FPX ‚Äì Financial Process Exchange. FPX supports online direct debit as well as batch direct debit. It opens new doors for e-commerce in Malaysia, in particular business to business (B2B) and business to commerce (B2C) payments. FPX allow customers to make payment at e-market places such as websites and online stores as well as for corporations to collect bulk payment from their customers. It leverages on the Internet banking services of participating banks and provides fast, secure, reliable, real-time online payment processing. FPX provides a complete end-to-end business transaction, resourceful payment records, simplified reconciliation and reduced risks as fund movements are between established financial institutions. Supported by Bank Negara Malaysia and the local financial institutions, FPX is operated by FPX Payment Gateway Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary company of Malaysian Electronic Payment System (1997) Sdn Bhd (MEPS). =Australia= In Australia, direct debit is performed through the direct entry system also known as BECS (Bulk Electronic Clearing System) or CS2, managed by the Australian Payments Network Limited. An account holder can authorise a company to collect direct debit payments, without notifying the bank, but direct debit is not available on all financial accounts. A common example of direct debit is authorising a credit card company to debit a bank account for the monthly balance. Many smaller companies do not have direct debit facilities themselves, and a third-party payment service must be used to interface between the biller and the customer's bank. For this a small charge (typically $1‚Äì2 per transaction, incorporated into the bill amount) is made by the payment service. Direct credit and debit instructions are only available to institutional customers. Direct credit instructions are used for payrolls and other large scale regular payments. Direct debit instructions are used by insurance companies, utilities and other large organisations which receive regular payments. Although governed by APCA rules, the actual exchanges of instructions occur through bilateral exchanges. There is no central \\"clearinghouse\\" for bulk direct entry payment instructions. =United States= In the United States, direct debit usually means an Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfer from a bank account to a biller, initiated by the biller. =South Africa= In South Africa direct debits, also known as debit orders, are performed through the ACB (Automated Clearing Bureau). An account holder can authorise a company to collect direct debit payments. The client signs a debit mandate form giving the requesting company permission to debit their account with a fixed or variable monthly value. This value can be recurring or once-off. This is an effective, safe and more cost effective alternative to receiving money in cash, by cheque or EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer). There are three types of commonly used debit orders in South Africa: EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer), NAEDO (Non-authenticated Early Debit Order) and AEDO (Authenticated Early Debit Order). A new payment stream is being introduced by the South African Reserve Bank called AC or Authenticated Collections. This payment stream will be implemented from September 2016 (early 2017) and aims to replace the current NAEDO payment stream. The purpose of AC is to reduce customer disputes and abuse of the debit order system. The AC payment stream will be known to consumers as DebiCheck. =Sweden= In Sweden, direct debit is available, called Autogiro. The amount is withdrawn from the payer's account on the payee's request without specification. The approval is done once without time limit for each payer/payee combination, but can be withdrawn at any time. The request is normally sent through a form from the payer to the payee, but in the internet bank it is also possible to request it. Autogiro should not be confused with the electronic billing system E-faktura although some banks let the payer instruct the bank to automatically pay received electronic bills on their due date without the customer having to log in to the internet bank and authorize the payment. = Switzerland = Switzerland has a form of direct debit called Lastschriftverfahren (LSV) der Banken. The setup of a direct debit is by signed authority to the bank. Depending on the proposition of the bank, the direct debit is claimed and may or may not require authorisation. Some banks allow a limit to be put in place for automatic approval. =Turkey= In Turkey, direct debits are widely used, for utility and credit card payments, as well as commercial transactions. However, whereas in other countries the payee instructs his/her bank to make a collection, in Turkey the payer needs to authorise his/her bank directly. The usage differs from standing orders, as payment amounts are not fixed and payments need not be periodical (i.e. payments can be of any amount and can be casual or periodic).

The game was later published on Mac OS X by Feral Interactive. The player assumes the role of a Ghost Master, a bureaucratic spirit tasked to perform certain duties. While the bulk of a Ghost Master's duties consist of hauntings, a Ghost Master may also be \\"called in\\" to increase belief in the supernatural, avenge deaths, and conscript renegade ghosts. Because a Ghost Master cannot directly interfere in the world of mortals, the Ghost Master is given a team of subordinate ghosts to do so. When not haunting, the Ghost Master is responsible for the training of the ghosts under their command. Gameplay The game consists of 15 levels. In all but a few levels, the primary goal of the game is to scare away all the mortals (humans) and cause them to flee the area in fear or succumb to madness. Ghost Master plays similarly to a real-time strategy game. The player first chooses the ghosts he wants to field in the level. The player cannot field every ghost in every place. Each ghost has one or two types of objects (or \\"fetters\\") it can be bound to. For example, a ghost who died during a robbery could only be bound to a \\"Murder Fetter,\\" whereas a water spirit can only be bound to a bath, sink, or a simple puddle of water. Another limiting factor is \\"Plasm\\". This numerical resource dictates which abilities a ghost can use. As a human becomes frightened, Plasm is generated. With more Plasm, stronger abilities (and more ghosts) can be fielded at any one time. Once the objective(s) for a level has been completed, the game rates the player's progress. Many factors are considered, including time, amount of impact on the mortals, and how many mortals fled. If the player is able to complete the mission fairly quickly, there is a multiplier added to the final score. This score determines the amount of \\"Gold Plasm\\" given to the player, which is used to add more spells to ghost's arsenal. The game ends with a cliffhanger, with the Ghostbreakers bringing in a bomb that would completely erase supernatural presence in the city where the game takes place. Because of the lack of a sequel, a bonus level was released for fans, which provided some closure. However, the bonus level is only available for the UK version of the game and was not released for the retail US version. =Bonus content= The bonus level is included in the Steam and Good Old Games release of the game. The bonus level \\"Class of Spook'em high\\" is the only downloadable content released for the game. In the level, the Ghostbreakers attack the HQ of ghost master, an old, abandoned mansion that the player has to defeat the Ghostbreakers in order to win the game. The bonus content was released in place of a sequel. =Restless spirits= Each level also has \\"Restless Spirits,\\" haunters bound to a certain location in some levels, there are often \\"secret\\" locations of the haunters, requiring the player to use a move or complete an objective to reveal their location, usually having a back-story as to why they are there. The player can use haunters they already brought with them to free them using a certain move, or a combination, an example is in the first level, the restless spirit, \\"Weatherwitch\\" is bound to a vacuum cleaner the player has to use an electric fetter move to free her, causing the vacuum cleaner to malfunction, and release weather-witch. =Mortal defenses and abilities= All mortals have a belief level, which partially determines the effectiveness of a ghost's powers upon them. The belief bar is raised slightly with every scare, and particular powers are able to raise belief better than others. Every mortal also has conscious and subconscious fears which are linked to certain ghost's powers. Scaring a mortal with a power that appeals to their fear is particularly effective on him or her. These are usually unknown at the beginning of each level, but some ghosts have the ability to expose these fears. Mortals also have a terror level and a madness level, with certain limits to each. When a human's terror bar is raised to a certain level, he/she flees, this is the objective of most of the in-game levels. The madness bar is filled only by the use of certain powers. When a mortal's madness bar reaches a certain point, they go insane, which is visible in that they now just roam the area of the scenario in a frenzy and are unable to be scared or maddened any more. The fear bar reduces as time progresses in the game, but the belief and madness bars do not. Somewhere between average humans and ghosts are priests, witches, and mediums. These humans have the ability to banish ghosts that are fielded. Banished ghosts are no longer usable during that level, but are returned after the mission is complete. Also, a large score penalty is levied on players who allow ghosts to be banished. Ghostbreakers are the most dangerous mortals, from a supernatural perspective. They are able to detect and banish ghosts at a much faster speed than the other \\"special\\" mortals mentioned previously. They are also able to field special wards, which prevent the player from fielding, or benching, ghosts trapped underneath them. Only if the electrical generators are destroyed do the wards fail. Reception The PC and PlayStation 2 versions received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while the Xbox version received \\"mixed\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The staff of X-Play nominated Ghost Master for their 2003 \\"Best Strategy Game\\" award, which ultimately went to Rise of Nations.

It was recorded extremely quickly in September 1970 following the band's success at the Isle of Wight Festival but with an attitude of relaxation, the band having achieved worldwide success with their previous album Fire and Water (26 June 1970) and the single \\"All Right Now\\". It is a low-key and introspective album compared with its predecessors. Recording From a writing point of view Highway continued in the same vein as previous albums, with vocalist Paul Rodgers and bassist Andy Fraser collaborating on seven of the nine songs. For the most part it was the easiest of their albums to record as they had achieved their desire to have a hit single and returned to the studio with renewed confidence' Guitarist Paul Kossoff however found sudden fame more difficult to deal with, and remembered the aftermath of \\"All Right Now\\" as being \\"a great increase in pressure from every angle\\" (quoted in Phil Sutcliffe's liner notes). He preferred the more serious, weighty songs on the album such as \\"Be My Friend\\", which he saw as an antidote to the \\"frivolity\\" of \\"All Right Now\\". It was their last album to be recorded in a position of success and security, as its failure contributed to the emotionally insecure Kossoff's growing drug addiction and the band's temporary split, from which it never truly recovered. Some, including drummer Simon Kirke, also cite the death of Kossoff's idol Jimi Hendrix (which occurred during the sessions for this album on 18 September 1970), as an important factor in his eventual breakdown. Reception Much to the band's disappointment, the album only reached No. 41 in the UK album charts (the previous album Fire and Water had reached #2) and only reached No. 190 in the US. The single release \\"The Stealer\\" failed in the UK also, and only reached No. 49 in the US. (Rodgers and Kirke would later re- record \\"The Stealer\\" with Bad Company in 1975 during the sessions for band's third album Run with the Pack (1976), but the track was not included on the album). The album received a lukewarm critical reaction. The single release \\"The Stealer\\" had not been Island Records boss Chris Blackwell's first choice: He had wanted to release \\"Ride on a Pony\\" but this was changed at the band's insistence. Some, such as engineer Andy Johns, blamed the album cover which was aesthetically flat compared to previous releases and did not prominently display the band's name. It was believed that some fans who otherwise would have bought the album failed to notice it because of this. One UK newspaper even reported the album as being recorded by ‚ÄúThe Highway group‚Äù stating ‚Äúit‚Äôs a good album for a party or discotheque, with a touch of the Rolling Stones‚Äô influence.‚Äù They returned to the studio in early 1971 and managed to record four tracks before they eventually split, after fulfilling contracted tour dates. These 'limbo' tracks included the surprise UK #4 hit single \\"My Brother Jake\\";Free singles & albums charts at OfficialCharts.com the other three have surfaced on various other albums over the years. A notable cover version in 1971 is \\"Be My Friend\\" by Sylvia McNeill, produced by Tony Hall, on RCA 2058 (UK 45rpm).

The school was founded by Gao Hama in 1939. In 1980, it was named a Key Middle School () by the government of Jiangsu province. In 1996 it was designated as a Provincial Run School () and it passed the National Model School Qualification () in 1999. Description In the 1950s Jiangyan Middle School became a public school. The scale of the school expanded, and when the number of students increased, the school facilities became deficient. New classrooms and offices were built, and a new auditorium at the same time. In 1952, on the former site of the South Day Temple, the school built the auditorium, named the May Fourth Movement Hall. The hall has an area of , with a stage, a film projection booth, and other amenities. The auditorium is heavily used as a meeting room, a restaurant for students, a factory workshop, and a dorm room. There are three interconnected buildings in the school, one for each grade. There is a reading room in which students can read books, do homework, or discuss problems. The main administration building has a Roman style. Staff The school has more than 260 teaching and administrative staff. Cooperation with a high school in Australia in 1999 led to several teacher exchanges between the schools. Since the reform and opening up of China, Jiangyan Middle School has attracted many young students from beyond Jiangsu province. Many students have achieved good scores in the national college entrance exam. The Jianyan Computer Science Olympia team placed first in the Jiangsu tournament, and over 30 students have won provincial or higher awards. The secretary general of the school was named to the National Advanced Party Branch (). Awards In 2007 Jiangyan Middle School became one of the first five-star high schools in Jiangsu province; it is the only five-star high school in Taizhou. The students consistently excel in the university entrance exams and win provincial prizes each year. Recently three students have won gold prizes and one student won the international gold prize. Each year, approximately ten students are admitted Tsinghua University and Beijing University.

It was founded by C. Fred Bergsten in 1981 and is currently led by Adam S. Posen. The institute conducts research, provides policy recommendations, and publishes books/articles on a wide range of topics related to international economics. According to the 2015 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report (Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania), PIIE was number 20 (of 150) in the \\"Top Think Tanks Worldwide\\" and number 13 (of 60) in the \\"Top Think Tanks in the United States\\".

The Peterson Institute is not to be confused with the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an entirely separate organization that also receives support from the Peterson Family. History The Institute was founded by C. Fred Bergsten in 1981, in response to a proposal from the German Marshall Fund (GMF). The President of the GMF, Frank Loy, as well as the President of the Council on Foreign Relations, Leslie Gelb, asked Bergsten to create a research institution focused on assessing the growing importance of the international economy in light of recent geopolitical events. During the 1970s, President Richard Nixon ended the link to the gold standard, the first oil shock occurred in 1973, and the first G5 summit convened. As a result, the new PIIE sought to conduct policy-oriented research on international economic issues by bringing together experts, academics, and policymakers. The GMF committed an initial $4 million to the Institute. The PIIE's founding chairman was Peter G. Peterson, who had served on Nixon's Council on International Economic Policy and as Secretary of Commerce. Anthony M. Solomon (the Undersecretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs and President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) and Richard N. Cooper (a consultant to the National Security Council) also joined the PIIE in the early 1970s. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the PIIE expanded to become one of the most internationally recognized think tanks in Washington D.C. The Ford Foundation was also a major supporter of the PIIE, having provided a major grant in 1991. In the 1990s, the PIIE created a number of endowed chairs for its members: one in honor of Reginald Jones, the former CEO of General Electric, and another for Dennis Weatherstone, the former CEO of JP Morgan. It moved from 11 Dupont Circle to its current building on Massachusetts Avenue in 2001. In 2006, a capital campaign led to the creation of a sizable endowment in order to celebrate the PIIE's 25th anniversary. Previously known as the Institute of International Economics, it changed its name that same year in recognition of Peter G. Peterson's role in the capital campaign and for his longstanding support of the Institute since the early 1980s. At its conference in New York, NY, a number of major economic figures attended: Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve Board Chairman; Robert Rubin, former Secretary of the Treasury; Jean-Claude Trichet, Governor of the European Central Bank, among others. Adam S. Posen succeeded Bergsten as President on January 1, 2013. Michael A. Peterson succeeded his father Peter G. Peterson as Chairman in the spring of 2018. The Institute's annual budget is about $12‚Äì13 million and it is financially supported by foundations, private corporations, and individuals, as well as earnings from its publications and capital fund.

Comparative analyses in advanced economies show the tax proposal will increase the budget deficit, unless coupled with a reduction of tax loopholes. Building Peterson Institute for International Economics Building In 2001 the Peterson Institute moved into a building it commissioned and built at 1750 Massachusetts Avenue (\\"Embassy Row\\"), NW, Washington, D.C. It is located across from the main Brookings Institution building, diagonally across from Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and next to the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. The building was designed by James von Klemperer from the architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox. Its state-of-the-art conference center is named in honor of the Institute's founder, C. Fred Bergsten. The sculpture garden is named in honor of Institute benefactor Anthony M. Solomon. The building houses several pieces of art donated by Stephan Schmidheiny, a former director of the Institute, including a sculpture by Joan Mir√≥ and a painting by Elizabeth Murray. It also houses collections of Chinese and African art donated by William M. Keck II, Ambassador John M. Yates, and Anthony M. Solomon. The building was granted the Best Architecture for 2001 award by the Washington Business Journal and won a Best Design award from the American Institute of Architects in 2003. Former U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat opined that the Peterson Institute building \\"is to international economics what the House that Ruth Built Yankee Stadium was to baseball\\". A contemporary review by Washington Post architectural critic Benjamin Forgey observed that \\"this is a very pretty building, lovely to look at on its own,\\" finding its proportions \\"satisfying\\" and its workmanship \\"superb\\".  Criticism  In an opinion piece for The New York Times published in 2016, Steven Rattner called the new building of the Peterson Institute \\"the locker room of the Team Globalization and Free Trade cheering squad.\\" We should not close our borders or retreat from the world, said Rattner, but free trade has winners and losers, and \\"we need to be more sensitive to the losers and try to help,\\" for example by redistribution of income through the tax system, which, he said, we haven't been doing. He goes on to state that Ross Perot was right when he said that the North American Free Trade Agreement would transfer American jobs to Mexico, particularly in manufacturing. From 2009 to 2013, employment in the American auto manufacturing sector rose by 23%, from 560,000 to 690,000. But employment in the Mexican auto sector rose from 368,000 to 589,000, or 60%. \\"I‚Äôm happy that 221,000 more Mexicans got jobs,\\" he writes, \\"but let‚Äôs be honest: Absent open borders, many of those jobs would have been in America.\\" He concludes by pointing out that wages in American auto manufacturing are down by 12.7%. Furthermore, American auto manufacturing compensation was $35.67 an hour; in Mexico, it was $6.36 an hour. Adam Posen, then the Peterson Institute's director, responded that ‚Äúfetishization‚Äù of any industry was ‚Äúimmoral.‚Äù China-related donors to PIIE such as Huawei and Ronnie Chan have attracted critical attention.

The X1 was designed by the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam, an academic organization that had been involved in computer design since 1947, and manufactured by Electrologica NV, * a company formed expressly for the purpose of producing the machine. The X1 was a solid-state binary computer (\\"completely transistorized\\") with magnetic core memory. Word-length was 27 bits and peripherals included punched and magnetic tape. It was one of the first European computers to have an interrupt facility. The X1 was the subject of Edsger Dijkstra's Ph.D. dissertation, and the target of the first complete working ALGOL 60 compiler, completed by Dijkstra and Jaap Zonneveld.The Dijkstra-Zonneveld ALGOL 60 compiler for the Electrologica X1 In 1965, the X1 was superseded by the X8. Electrologica was taken over by Philips a few years later. Instruction set The X1 allowed conditional execution of every instruction, not just branches as is the case in most computers. A similar capability existed in the Zuse Z22 and the ZEBRA, and much later in the ARM architecture. The approach used in the X1 is more flexible than these others: it makes execution conditional on the current state of the condition flag that is set by a previous instruction if it includes a modifier for that purpose, but untouched otherwise.\\"Communication with an Automatic Computer\\", Dijkstra's Ph.D. thesis As a result, conditional execution can be based on tests made some number of lines earlier, rather than being conditional only based on the result of the most recent arithmetic operation. This allowed for compact expression of programs. The following example demonstrates the loading of the value of memory at n into the accumulator A, calling a subroutine (which presumably uses that value in A), and finally setting A to be the absolute value of the number read: 2A n P // copy [n] to A, set condition flag to \\"yes\\" if positive 6T fn 0 // call the function at fn, which will return with the condition flag preserved N 5P AA // if condition flag is \\"no\\", copy -A to A The X1 arithmetic operators used binary ones' complement arithmetic. Assembler The X1 included a simple assembler in its read-only memory. It has rather basic features: symbolic addresses may be defined, but symbols are only two letters long. Instructions are named by a combination of a digit representing the operation, and a letter designating the register to be operated on, or one or two letters indicating an operation class. For example, \\"0A\\" means \\"add memory content to accumulator A\\", and \\"5P\\" means \\"set an accumulator to the negative of another accumulator\\". The normal use of symbolic addresses is to name \\"paragraphs\\", i.e., related blocks of code or data. The symbolic addresses would be modified by a \\"line number\\" (a numeric offset) and a \\"page number\\" (a number in the range 0 to 31). For example, \\"3 FE 6\\" is line number 3, page number 6, representing an offset of 195 (6 * 32 + 3) from the start of paragraph FE. This address notation is a peculiarity of the assembler; the hardware addressing simply uses 15 bit addresses.

It is computed by summing the conventional score of each defeated opponent, and half the conventional score of each drawn opponent. Neustadtl score is named after Hermann Neustadtl, who proposed it in a letter published in Chess Monthly in 1882. It is often called the Sonneborn‚ÄìBerger score, though this is something of a misnomer, since William Sonneborn and Johann Berger were actually strong critics of the system; they proposed their own tie-breaking system that added in the raw score of each player but that did not help with tiebreaking and was therefore never popular and is not in use today. More common tiebreaking methods in chess tournaments include the Neustadtl Sonneborn‚ÄìBerger score, head-to-head score, Koya score, or favouring the player with the most wins (or black games). In Swiss system events, comparison of the Buchholz scores and the sum of progressive scores are common. Neustadtl Sonneborn‚ÄìBerger score A player's Neustadtl Sonneborn‚ÄìBerger score is calculated by adding the sum of the conventional scores of the players he/she has defeated to half the sum of the conventional scores of those he/she has drawn against. The main point is to give more value for a win/draw against a player ranked high, than for a win/draw against a player ranked low in the tournament.Chess.com: Tie-break methods Since players may share the same Neustadtl score, further means of breaking ties may be required; common methods include considering the score in games played between the tied players or favouring the player with the most wins. Some tournaments do not use Neustadtl to break ties at all (Linares, for example, gives preference to the player with the most wins), and others use no tie-breaking method at all, sharing the prize money on offer between players. In national championships or events which act as qualifying tournaments for others, there may be a blitz playoff between the tied players. Neustadtl remains the most common tie-breaking method in round-robin tournaments, though in Swiss system events, comparison of the Buchholz scores and the sum of progressive scores is more common. =Example= As an example of the system in action, here is the crosstable of the 1975‚Äì80 World Correspondence Chess Championship Final (here cs indicates conventional score, ns Neustadtl score): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 cs ns 1\\\\.

Sonneborn was a strong critic of the Neustadtl score, and suggested adding in the player's raw score. Berger supported this. In truth, adding in the raw score does no good when ranking tied players, so the suggestion died out and is seldom used today.

It is located in the Chiltern Hills just to the north of Chesham and forms a boundary along its length with Hertfordshire. It comprises the hamlet of Buckland Common, and the villages of Cholesbury, Hawridge and St Leonards which were brought together as part of the local government reorganisation in April 1934. The parish has since increased in size through the annexing of additional parcels of land which previously were part of Chesham, Ashley Green and Drayton Beauchamp. History In common with many other villages close to the scarp of the Chiltern Hills, the parishes formed from the ancient manors and estates ran from the fertile Vale of Aylesbury up the step wooded slope onto the Chiltern plateau and dip slope. They are collectively known by the social geographic term of strip parishes. Over time the upland communities, which had originally been temporary outposts connected to summer agricultural activity (transhumance), became distinct, permanent settlements. Prior to 1934, the local government arrangements covering the area of the present-day parish were distributed across a number of separate civil parishes. Cholesbury has historical associations with Drayton Beauchamp, becoming an autonomous manor and parish from the 14th century. Meanwhile, Hawridge which has historic associations with Marsworth, despite the two settlements being separated by a narrow strip of land in Hertfordshire became an autonomous unit from around the 16th century. The other two main settlements of the modern-day parish, prior to 1934, were the upland portions of two other parishes. St Leonards had been part of a civil parish with Aston Clinton (also for a time known as Aston Clinton St Leonards). The hamlet of Buckland Common had been within the parish of Buckland. Additionally, as part of a contemporary county boundary changes, a narrow strip of mainly arable fields and woodland plantation which ran adjacent to the county boundary was also transferred from Drayton Beauchamp parish, as was part of the hamlet of Heath End, a small parcel of land previously in Wingginton parish in Hertfordshire. More recently, a section of land, formally part of Chesham parish has become incorporated at the Hawridge end of the parish. Recreation and Culture The relative remoteness of the villages and hamlets within the parish area together with their close geographic and historic associations which have strengthened their mutually- held independence from the nearest towns have resulted in a cultural identity developing across the parish. Locally, they are known as the Hilltop Villages'. This is demonstrated by the existence of a number of long- established clubs and community organisations, which in similar fashion to the three local churches co-ordinate activities across the parish as a whole.Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards social activities diary Accessed 15 April 2010 =Sport and recreation= The cricket club was formed in 1895 and leases its ground, located in Cholesbury from the Lord of the Manors of Hawridge and Cholesbury. There is a recreation ground associated with the parish hall in St Leonards, used for football, gymkhana and village sports events. There are public open spaces: Hawridge and Cholesbury Commons and the parish council look after The Green at Buckland Common and nearby allotments. =Social activity= The villages hold annual f√™tes at St Leonards and on Hawridge and Cholesbury Commons. There are two community Halls, Cholesbury Village Hall, built in 1895 and St Leonards Parish Hall which opened in 1938, which host many of the parish-wide social activities such as; the Horticultural Society, Local History Group and Women's Institute. There are four public houses, The Black Horse, The Rose and Crown, The Full Moon and The White Lion. Parishioners have a long-standing tradition of commemorating important anniversaries and participate in national celebrations by organising events such as parish race days; exhibitions, parish walks, and other cultural activities. The most recent of these took place in April 2009 when in the parish celebrated the parish's 75th Anniversary through a series of events comprising, in April a talk and exhibition entitled 'The first 75 years of Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards Parish'. In May, an inter-village 6-a-side cricket competition was held. In June, a Beating the Bounds ceremony took place when there was a perambulation of the original (1934), fourteen-mile parish boundary, which in contrast to similar events in other counties was conducted in the traditional clockwise direction. In July, there was a celebratory 'Flower Show' at St Marys Church and later that month a parish 'Families Fun Sports Day', including events such as children's and adult races and a Tug of War which had been a feature of several earlier celebrations in the parish relating to parish anniversaries and coronations. In August the Horticultural Show had classes celebrating the anniversary. In October there was a Civil Service led by the local priest. The year of commemoration concluded in February with a pantomime (Humpty-Dumpty).Parish Newsletter and 75 Anniversary celebrations, Accessed 18 April 2010 Governance The Green at Buckland Common The Allotments at Buckland Common Governance for the civil parish is administered through a parish council. The parish is un-warded and comprises seven seats. The parish has been part of the local government area administered by Chiltern District Council since its inception in 1974 and is within the Chiltern Ridges ward of Buckinghamshire County Council. There are allotments and a village green at Buckland Common which are owned by the parish council. Key issues concerning parishioners include:- the increasingly poor condition and lack of maintenance of the local road network; lack in the availability of affordable housing; the negative impact on the Chilterns AONB of increased volumes of low-flying aircraft associated with Luton Airport; the impact of the proposed route through the Chilterns of the High Speed 2 the high speed railway between London and Birmingham which was announced in 2010 would be constructed from 2017 and be operational by 2025. Religion St Mary's Church, Hawridge Today there are three Anglican churches:- St Mary's Hawridge; St Laurence, Cholesbury and St Leonards which are part of the Diocese of Oxford. There was a fourth church located adjacent to the Green at Buckland Common, which was deconsecrated in 1939 having fallen into disrepair. Nearby, there was also a Strict Baptist chapel which continued to serve the community until the end of the 1970s. In Hawridge a mission hall ran until the 1980s. Economy Agriculture which formed the basis for most employment in the parish in the first part of the 20th century has ceased to be a significant source of work although there is employment for those supporting the remaining farming activities. There are no shops post offices in the parish. The majority of residents are employed in the surrounding towns; or further afield in London. Since the introduction of broadband a growing number of self-employed and small businesses are run from home. Education Originally, there were two primary schools in the parish. The St Leonards School closed in the 1970s and today education for children up to year 6 is provided by Hawridge and Cholesbury Church of England School, located in Hawridge. The falling numbers of school age children has resulted in the school providing education to pupils living outside the catchment area, primarily on the outskirts of Chesham.

The catalog of the library of the Cathedral Chapter in Krak√≥w dating from 1110 shows that Polish scholars already then had access to western European literature. In 1364, King Kazimierz the Great founded the Cracow Academy, which would become one of the great universities of Europe. The Polish people have made considerable contributions in the fields of science, technology and mathematics. The list of famous scientists in Poland begins in earnest with the polymath, astronomer and mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus, who formulated the heliocentric theory and made an important contribution to the scientific revolution. In 1773 King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski established the Commission of National Education, the world's first ministry of education. After the third partition of Poland, in 1795, no Polish state existed. The 19th and 20th centuries saw many Polish scientists working abroad. One of them was Maria Sk≈Çodowska-Curie, a physicist and chemist living in France. Another noteworthy one was Ignacy Domeyko, a geologist and mineralogist who worked in Chile. In the first half of the 20th century, Poland was a flourishing center of mathematics. Outstanding Polish mathematicians formed the Lw√≥w School of Mathematics (with Stefan Banach, Hugo Steinhaus, Stanis≈Çaw Ulam) and Warsaw School of Mathematics (with Alfred Tarski, Kazimierz Kuratowski, Wac≈Çaw Sierpi≈Ñski). The events of World War II pushed many of them into exile. Such was the case of Beno√Æt Mandelbrot, whose family left Poland when he was still a child. An alumnus of the Warsaw School of Mathematics was Antoni Zygmund, one of the shapers of 20th-century mathematical analysis. According to NASA, Polish scientists were among the pioneers of rocketry. Today Poland has over 100 institutions of post-secondary education ‚Äî technical, medical, economic, as well as 500 universities ‚Äî which are located in most major cities such as Gda≈Ñsk, Krak√≥w, Lublin, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Pozna≈Ñ, Rzesz√≥w and Warsaw. They employ over 61,000 scientists and scholars. Another 300 research and development institutes are home to some 10,000 researchers. There are, in addition, a number of smaller laboratories. All together, these institutions support some 91,000 scientists and scholars.

Her works are included in many public collections, including those of the National Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C.), the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra), the Des Moines Art Center, Walker Art Center (Minneapolis),Entry for Nancy Graves on ArtCyclopedia and the Museum of Fine Arts (St. Petersburg, FL). When Graves was just 29, she was given a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art. At the time she was the youngest artist, and fifth woman to achieve this honor. Early life and studies Graves was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Her interest in art, nature, and anthropology was fostered by her father, an accountant at a local museum. After graduating from Vassar College in English Literature, Graves attended Yale University, where she received her bachelor's and master's degrees. Fellow Yale Art and Architecture alumni of the 1960s include the painters, photographers, and sculptors Brice Marden, Richard Serra, Chuck Close, Janet Fish, Gary Hudson, Rackstraw Downes, and Robert Mangold.Ken Johnson (March 11, 2005), Art in Review; Nancy Graves New York Times. After her graduation in 1964, she received a Fulbright Scholarship and studied painting in Paris. Continuing her international travels, she then moved on to Florence. During the rest of her life, she would also travel to Morocco, Germany, Canada, India, Nepal, Kashmir, Egypt, Peru, China, Australia.Cathleen McGuigan (December 6, 1987), Forms of Fantasy New York Times. She was married to Richard Serra from 1965 to 1970.Roberta Smith (October 24, 1995), Nancy Graves, 54, Prolific Post-Minimalist Artist New York Times. Work A prolific artist who worked in painting, sculpture, printmaking and film, Graves first made her presence felt on the New York art scene in the late 1960s and 70's, with life-size sculptures of camels that seemed as accurate as a natural history display. Like-minded artists included Eva Hesse, Close, Bruce Nauman, Keith Sonnier, and Serra, to whom Graves was married from 1965 to 1970.Roberta Smith (October 24, 1995), Nancy Graves, 54, Prolific Post-Minimalist Artist New York Times. Her work has strong ties to the Alexander Calder's stabiles and to the sculptures of David Smith, with their welded parts and found objects; she collected works by both artists. Her most famous sculpture, Camels, was first displayed in the Whitney Museum of American Art. The sculpture features three separate camels, each made of many materials, among them burlap, wax, fiberglass, and animal skin. Each camel is also painted with acrylics and oil colors to appear realistic. The camels are now stored in the National Gallery of Canada, and two later \\"siblings\\" reside in the Ludwig Forum f√ºr Internationale Kunst in Aachen, Germany. Working in Fiberglas, latex, marble dust and other unorthodox materials, Graves later moved on to camel skeletons and bones, which she dispersed about the floor or hung from ceilings. In Variability of Similar Forms (1970), from drawings that Graves made of Pleistocene camel skeletons, she sculpted 36 individual leg bones in various positions, each nearly the height of a man, and arranged them upright in an irregular pattern on a wooden base. In the early 1970s, she made five films. Two of them, Goulimine, 1970 and Izy Boukir, recorded the movement of camels in Morocco, reflecting the influence of Eadweard Muybridge's motion- study photography. In 1976, German art collector Peter Ludwig commissioned a wax variation of a 1969 sculpture of camel bones. Graves began showing open- form polychrome sculptures in 1980, one prime example being Trace, a very large tree whose trunk was made from ribbons of bronze with foliage of steel mesh.Grace Glueck (October 22, 1982), Art: Botanical Bronzes from Nancy Graves New York Times. Also in the early 1980s, she began to produce the works for which she became most widely known: the colorfully painted, playfully disjunctive assemblages of found objects cast in bronze, including plants, mechanical parts, tools, architectural elements, food products and much more. Graves also created a distinctive body of aerial landscapes, mostly based on maps of the Moon and similar sources. Below is a link to an example (VI Maskeyne Da Region of the Moon). Author Margret Dreikausen (1985) writes extensively of Graves's aerial works as part of a broader discussion of the aerial view and its importance in modern and contemporary art. Graves also began using the lost wax technique in her later work. She would cast delicate objects in bronze. Then use them to create arrangements. Her color scheme changed over time to bright colors in the 1980s and then shifted to more \\"subtle\\" colors in the 1990s. Some of Graves's other works include: *Goulimine (film, 1970) *Izy Boukir (film, 1971) *VI Maskeyne Da Region of the Moon (lithograph, 1972)VI Maskeyne Da Region of the Moon, Memorial Art Gallery, rochester.edu. *Fragment (painting, 1977)Fragment painting, Memorial Art Gallery, rochester.edu. *Wheelabout (sculpture, 1985)Wheelabout sculpture, themodern.org, Nancy Graves. *Hindsight (sculpture, 1986)Hindsight sculpture, Walker Art Center. *Immovable Iconography (sculpture, 1990)Immovable Iconography sculpture, Nancy Graves, Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art. *Footscray (oil on canvas, paint, and sculpture) *Metaphore & Melanomy, (cast bronze, 1995)Walla Walla Foundry, Nancy Graves. *Camels, VI, VII, VIII (wood, steel, burlap, polyurethane, wax, oil paint, 1969) *Fossils (Plaster, dust, marble dust, acrylic and steel, 1970) *Calipers (Hot-rolled steel, 1970) *Shaman (Latex on muslin, wax, steel, copper, aluminum wire, gauze, oil paint, marble dust, and acrylic, 1970) *Variability and Repetition of Similar Forms II (Bronze and COR-TEN steel, 1979) *Trambulate (Bronze and carbon steel with polyurethane paint and baked enamel, 1984) At the end of her life, Graves was incorporating handblown glass into her sculptures and experimenting with poly- optics, a glasslike material that can be cast. Graves worked and lived in Soho and in Beacon, New York, where she maintained a studio. Exhibitions Graves, whose first New York exhibition was at the Graham Gallery in 1968, has been represented by M. Knoedler & Company since 1980. She exhibited extensively in galleries in the United States and Europe and is represented in museums around the world. A comprehensive museum retrospective, organized by the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, later traveled to the Brooklyn Museum in 1987. When the restored Rainbow Room reopened in Manhattan's Rockefeller Center in 1987, a Graves sculpture was installed at the entrance. A solo exhibition, \\"Nancy Graves: Mapping\\" was held at Mitchell-Innes & Nash in 2019. Mitchell-Innes & Nash has represented the Estate of Nancy Graves since 2014. The exhibition was accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue with an essay by Robert Storr.

In May, less than a month later, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and died the following October, aged 55.

Terra incognita (90 x 120), oil & metal on canvas The artist seems to get his inspiration from several aspects of the social fabric. Communication and in-communication are recurring central themes in his work. Topics like alienation, seclusion, unrest, insecurity appear to be starting points for visual productions. Viewing a painting becomes a semiotic experience, and words, titles, sentences, and graffiti should be extensions and elucidations of a visual effect. The creation of a work is, at the same time, plastic and literary.https://www.facebook.com/73320708795/videos/happiness-blowing-in-the- wind-by-erik-pevernagie-100-x-100-cm-oil-on-canvasstart/10153256069203796/ If \\"details\\" add to the structure of the work, the small items of life seem to be the cornerstones through which the viewer can comprehend the world.

While the characters are integrated into their environment, through geometric lines and compositional planes, figuration and abstractionism are forced to a compromise, visibly with a view to generating a range of emotions and reflections. As the material on the canvas and the color process play an essential role, sand and metal filings are used to give a distinctive texture. The artist obviously has a dialectical approach towards \\"presence\\" and \\"absence,\\" and towards the \\"painted\\" and \\"non- painted\\" matter in art, which seems to create a kind of tension, visually and mentally.https://www.facebook.com/73320708795/videos/10153278522468796/ Quotes Les choses avaient enfin perdu leur pesanteur *\\"Erik Pevernagie is primarily known for combining both figurative and abstract elements in his works.

Located on an isthmus on the island, the memorial also celebrates the lasting peace between Britain, Canada, and the United States that followed the war. Overview A monument ‚Äî the world's most massive Doric column ‚Äî was constructed in Put-in-Bay, Ohio by a multi-state commission from 1912 to 1915 \\"to inculcate the lessons of international peace by arbitration and disarmament.\\" The memorial was designed after an international competition from which the winning design by Joseph H. Freelander and A.D. Seymour was chosen. Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial was established to honor those who fought in the Battle of Lake Erie during the War of 1812, and to celebrate the long-lasting peace among Britain, Canada and the U.S. The Memorial column, rising over Lake Erie, is situated five miles from the longest border in the world. Although the monument bears the name of Oliver Hazard Perry, six officers slain during the battle are interred under its rotunda, Perry himself is buried in Newport, Rhode Island. Beneath the stone floor of the monument lie the remains of those three American officers and three British officers. Carved into the walls inside the rotunda are the names of soldiers and sailors who were killed or injured in the Battle of Lake Erie and the text of the Rush-Bagot Treaty. The Doric Column is the only international peace memorial in the United States National Park System and stands 47 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. The upper deck platform is 12 feet higher than the statue of Liberty's torch. To visit the observation deck near the top, visitors must walk up 37 steps, pay the admission cost ($10.00 cash, card, or check for adults 16 and older starting 2019 season, 15 and younger are free) then a National Park Ranger will transport them by elevator to the top. Rangers are stationed at the observation deck to answer questions and speak about the history and surrounding area. Views span Lake Erie, the islands and mainland of Ohio, and nearby islands in Ontario, including Middle Island, the southernmost point of land in Canada, and part of Point Pelee National Park. The column is among the tallest monuments in the United States (the Gateway Arch, San Jacinto Monument, and Washington Monument are taller). Although substantially completed in 1915, funding problems prevented the proper completion of a fully realized memorial complex.Interstate Board of the Perry's Victory Centennial Commissioners; Watterson, Henry, 1840‚Äì1921. The Perry memorial and centennial celebration under the auspices of the national government and the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, New York, Rhode Island, Kentucky, Minnesota and Indiana (1912) (Cleveland, Ohio: The Board) In 1919 the federal government assumed control of the monument and provided additional funding. The official dedication was celebrated on July 31, 1931. In 2002, $2.4 million was spent on a new visitor center. The memorial is visited by 200,000 people each year. Administrative history Established as Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial National Monument by Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 2, 1936 (Proclamation No. 2182); redesignated a National Memorial and renamed on October 26, 1972. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966; the listing's boundaries were increased in 2015. 2013 US quarter coin The 2013 \\"Perry's Victory\\" quarter dollar Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial were selected to represent Ohio in the multi-year America the Beautiful Quarters series, honoring a national site from every US state, district, or territory. Its design shows Oliver Hazard Perry on the coin's reverse, depicting the site's statue of Perry with the International Peace Memorial in the distance. The design was selected from eleven proposals.CFA Reviews Second Round of Design Candidates for 2013 Quarters, Coin Update, Feb. 27, 2012 Structural concerns The Memorial had been closed for most of the summer of 2006 after a 500-pound (230 kg) piece of granite broke off the southeast face of the observation deck, falling and leaving a crater in the plaza in June. No one was injured. Following a structural assessment that deemed it safe for visitors, the memorial reopened on August 26, 2006, with a fence surrounding it. The monument closed on September 30, 2009 for repairs, and reopened on July 12 , 2012. The monument was closed once again for the summer of 2017 for repairs and cleaning. \\" The monument is open as of May 19, 2018 Memorial at Perry's Victory to Open July 3 After 2 Years of Restoration\\" (press release, 2012-06-26).

Interactions with the Boy Scouts of America Annually, the monument site hosts a large Boy Scout camporee hosted by Troop 360 from Port Clinton, Ohio. This camporee attracts a large amount of scout troops that camp by the monument grounds. This event, however, is highly susceptible to weather conditions, and has not been held due to flooding concerns.

Terms and factions All animal liberationists believe that the individual interests of non-human animals deserve recognition and protection, but the movement can be split into two broad camps. Animal rights advocates, or rights liberationists, believe that these basic interests confer moral rights of some kind on the animals, and/or ought to confer legal rights on them;\\"Animal rights,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2007. see, for example, the work of Tom Regan. Utilitarian liberationists, on the other hand, do not believe that animals possess moral rights, but argue, on utilitarian grounds ‚Äî utilitarianism in its simplest form advocating that we base moral decisions on the greatest happiness of the greatest number ‚Äî that, because animals have the ability to suffer, their suffering must be taken into account in any moral philosophy. To exclude animals from that consideration, they argue, is a form of discrimination that they call speciesism; see, for example, the work of Peter Singer.Taylor, Angus. Animals and Ethics. Broadview Press, 2003, pp. 153 ff. Despite these differences, the terms \\"animal liberation\\" and \\"animal rights\\" are generally used interchangeably. Factional division has also been characterized as that between the reformist or mainstream faction and the radical abolitionist and direct action factions. The mainstream faction is largely professionalized and focuses on soliciting donations and gaining media representation. This focus on resource mobilization, sought by means of frame alignment with dominant cultural frames, leads to compromise with targets. Actors in the reformist movement diagnose the problem as one of nonhuman animal mistreatment, offer a prognosis including welfare reform, and employ action frames that include moral shocks. It has been noted that the power of the animal rights movement in the United States is centralized in professionalized nonprofit organizations that prefer moderated goals of welfare reform and tend to be isomorphic. The abolitionist faction diagnoses the problem as one of nonhuman animal use, offers a prognosis including vegan outreach, and employ action frames including a rational and theoretic focus. Gary Francione, a leader in abolitionism, formed his approach in response to the traditional movement's focus on policy reform. Members of the abolitionist faction view policy reform as counterproductive and rely on nonviolent education and moral suasion in their repertoire of contention. They see the promotion of veganism as a low-opportunity cost means of creating an antispeciesist culture and posing an economic threat to the animal agriculture industrial complex. The direct action or militant faction includes in its repertoire of contention property damage, open releases, intimidation, and direct violence. With these, they offer a prognosis to the problem of animal use that focuses on changing society through force and fear. Animal rights actors often reject this faction, pointing to violence as a counterproductive tactic that invites repression (e.g., the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act) and does not economically or politically challenge extant systems. Smaller factions include groups focused around faith-based animal rights theory and veganarchists, whose approach is characterized by a critique of capitalism on the grounds that it has led to mass nonhuman, human, and environmental exploitation. Such factionalizing, researchers have pointed out, is common to social movements and plays a role in sustaining their health. History The Animal Rights Movement traces back to the animal protection movement in Victorian England, which was initiated by aristocratic moral crusaders in response to the poor treatment of urban workhorses and stray dogs. Other early influences include: Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel The Jungle, which drew attention to obscured slaughterhouse operations; Henry Salt's treatises on nonhuman animal rights; which drew from human abolitionist arguments for recognizing personhood of people considered to be property; and the Alcott House of New England, a community serving as a stop on the Underground Railroad and requiring its residents to eat a vegan diet.Philosopher Peter Singer The contemporary movement is regarded as having been founded in the UK in the early 1970s by a group of Oxford university post-graduate philosophy students, now known as the \\"Oxford Group\\".\\"Ethics: Animals.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 2007. The group was led by Rosalind and Stanley Godlovitch, graduate students of philosophy who had recently become vegetarians. The Godlovitches met John Harris and David Wood, also philosophy graduates, who were soon persuaded of the arguments in favour of animal rights and themselves became vegetarian. The group began to actively raise the issue with pre- eminent Oxford moral philosophers, including Professor Richard Hare, both personally and in lectures. Their approach was based not on sentimentality (\\"kindness to dumb animals'), but on the moral rights of animals. They soon developed (and borrowed) a range of powerful arguments in support of their views, so that Oxford clinical psychologist Richard Ryder, who was shortly to become part of the group, writes that \\"rarely has a cause been so rationally argued and so intellectually well armed.\\"Cox, Simon and Vadon, Richard. \\"How animal rights took on the world\\", BBC Radio 4. Retrieved June 18, 2006. It was a 1965 article by novelist Brigid Brophy in The Sunday Times which was pivotal in helping to spark the movement. Brophy wrote: The philosophers found this article and were inspired by its vigorous unsentimental polemic. At about the same time, Ryder wrote three letters to the Daily Telegraph in response to Brophy's arguments.Ryder, Richard. Letters to the editor, Daily Telegraph, April 7, May 3, and May 20, 1969. Brophy read Ryder's letters and put him in touch with the Godlovitches and John Harris, who had begun to plan a book about the issue which was also partly inspired by Brophy's polemic. The philosophers had also been to see Brophy about the possibility of a book of essays on the subject.Ryder, Richard. Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism. Berg, 2000, p. 6. They initially thought that a book with contributions from Brophy, Ruth Harrison, Maureen Duffy and other well-known writers might be of interest to publishers, but after an initial proposal was turned down by the first publisher they approached, Giles Gordon of Victor Gollancz suggested that the work would be more viable if it included their own writing. This was the idea that became \\"Animals, Men and Morals' (see below). Philosopher Tom Regan In 1970, Ryder coined the phrase \\"speciesism,\\" first using it in a privately printed pamphlet to describe the assignment of value to the interests of beings on the basis of their membership of a particular species.Ryder, Richard D. \\"All beings that feel pain deserve human rights\\", The Guardian, August 6, 2005. Ryder subsequently became a contributor to Animals, Men and Morals: An Inquiry into the Maltreatment of Non-humans (1972), edited by John Harris and the Godlovitches, a work that became highly influential,Godlovitch R, Godlovitch S, and Harris J. (1972). Animals, Men and Morals: An Inquiry into the Maltreatment of Non-humans as did Rosalind Godlovitch's essay \\"Animal and Morals,\\" published the same year. It was in a review of Animals, Men and Morals for the New York Review of Books that Australian philosopher Peter Singer first put forward his basic arguments, based on utilitarianism and drawing an explicit comparison between women's liberation and animal liberation. Out of the review came Singer's Animal Liberation, published in 1975, now regarded by many as the \\"bible\\" of the movement. Other books regarded as important include philosopher Tom Regan's The Case for Animal Rights (1983); Created from Animals: The Moral Implications of Darwinism by James Rachels (1990); Animals, Property, and the Law (1995) by legal scholar Gary Francione, Rattling the Cage: Toward Legal Rights for Animals by another legal scholar Steven M. Wise (2000); and Animal Rights and Moral Philosophy by Julian H. Franklin (2005).\\"Animal Rights: The Modern Animal Rights Movement.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2007.  Gender, class, and other factors  Another factor feeding the animal rights movement was revulsion to televised slaughters. In the United States, many public protest slaughters were held in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the National Farmers Organization. Protesting low prices for meat, farmers would kill their own animals in front of media representatives. The carcasses were wasted and not eaten. However, this effort backfired because it angered television audiences to see animals being needlessly and wastefully killed.page 19 of Growing a new agrarian myth: the american agriculture movement, identity, and the call to save the family farm by Ryan J. Stockwell The movement predominately comprises upper-class and middle-class white female members, owing this to its associations with the Victorian English animal protection movement and American feminism and environmentalism movements. As such, the movement is widely associated in public spheres with women, femininity, and effeminacy. Public perception of the movement is influenced by gendered evaluations; movement outsiders tend to view activists as irrational by virtue of overly emotional sentiments. Aware of this, activists have strategically incorporated men into positions of leadership and theory production, in order to legitimate the movement and counter popular beliefs about the primacy of emotion in the animal rights movement. This tactic relies on the popular perception of men as rational and not given to emotion, and follows a trend in social movement activism that seeks to counter traditional associations with femininity and private spheres by emphasizing rationality, rights, and justice. In one case study, targets of anti-hunting activism used class and gender markers to evaluate activists' claims. Hunters' associations of irrationality with femininity and of inexperience in hunting and wilderness with white-collar positions constituted the reasons for their dismissal of activists' claims. In contrast, hunters framed hunting in logical, scientific, and altruistic terms, thus legitimating hunting, termed wildlife management, as a protective measure. It has been noted that the composition of the movement may discourage the mobilization of particular demographics. A content analysis of magazine covers from highly visible animal rights organizations (PeTA and VegNews) revealed that most featured members were white, female, and thin. With this, and with the composition of the movement being mostly white, female, and thin, it has been suggested that animal rights media depict an activist ideal-type with such characteristics, and that this may mobilize thin white females while deterring others. Racialized, sexualized, and size-focused campaign tactics may also serve to deter potential members from joining the movement. Racialized tactics include the appropriation of African slavery and Holocaust language and imagery, and have been deemed insensitive and impugned by nonwhite communities. In addition, the movement has maintained racist stereotypes about nonwhite individuals' predisposition toward animal cruelty; these stereotypes arose in post-slavery U.S. and Britain, where nonwhites were deemed by law and by society to have a tendency toward animal cruelty. Sexualization of \\"ideal\\" women is used as a mobilization tactic, but reduces support for ethics-based campaigns and may be counterproductive, alienating women that do not have \\"ideal\\" body types. Sizeism is used as a tactic to frame veganism as a healthy and positive lifestyle, aligning with a popular association of fatness with moral failure. These tactics may contribute to gender inequality because unrealistic and sexualized representations of women are linked to their societal devaluation. Its lack of diverse membership may decrease the movement's legitimacy and ability to mobilize, as members of marginalized groups are more likely to mobilize when they are represented in the movement. An inclusive movement with strong group solidarity would decrease opportunity costs associated with participating (e.g., social stigmatization, lack of alternatives, legal persecution) and thus serve to increase and sustain participation in the movement. Current status of the movement The movement is no longer viewed as hovering on the fringe.Jonsson, Patrik. \\"Tracing an animal-rights philosophy\\", Christian Science Monitor, October 9, 2001. In the 1980s and 1990s, it was joined by a wide variety of academics and professionals, including lawyers, physicians, psychologists, veterinarians, and former vivisectionists, and is now a common subject of study in philosophy departments in Europe and North America. Animal law courses are taught in 92 out of 180 law schools in the U.S.,\\"Animal law courses\\" , Animal Legal Defense Fund. and the movement has gained the support of senior legal scholars, including Alan DershowitzDershowitz, Alan.

Retrieved July 12, 2006. In the 1980s, the movement became associated with punk subculture and ideologies, particularly straight edge hardcore punk in the United States and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom. This association continues on into the 21st century, as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as Fluff Fest in Europe. Michael Socarras of Greenberg Traurig told the Association of American Medical Colleges: \\"There is a very important shift under way in the manner in which many people in law schools and in the legal profession think about animals. This shift has not yet reached popular opinion. However, in [the U.S.], social change has and can occur through the courts, which in many instances do not operate as democratic institutions. Therefore, the evolution in elite legal opinion is extremely significant ...\\" Philosophical and legal aims The movement aims to include animals in the moral community by putting the basic interests of non-human animals on an equal footing with the basic interests of human beings. A basic interest would be, for example, not being made to suffer pain on behalf of other individual human or non-human animals. The aim is to remove animals from the sphere of property and to award them personhood; that is, to see them awarded legal rights to protect their basic interests. Liberationists argue that animals appear to have value in law only in relation to their usefulness or benefit to their owners, and are awarded no intrinsic value whatsoever. In the United States, for example, state and federal laws formulate the rules for the treatment of animals in terms of their status as property. Liberationists point out that Texas Animal Cruelty Laws apply only to pets living under the custody of human beings and exclude birds, deer, rabbits, squirrels, and other wild animals not owned by humans, ignoring that jurisdiction for such creatures comes under the domain of state wildlife officers. The U.S. Animal Welfare Act excludes \\"pet stores ... state and country fairs, livestock shows, rodeos, purebred dog and cat shows, and any fairs or exhibitions intended to advance agricultural arts and sciences.\\" There is no mention in the law that such activities already fall under the jurisdiction of state agriculture departments. The Department of Agriculture interprets the Act as also excluding cold-blooded animals, and warm-blooded animals not \\"used for research, teaching, testing, experimentation ... exhibition purposes, or as a pet, [and] farm animals used for food, fiber, or production purposes\\".A Critique of the Kantian Theory of Indirect Moral Duties to Animals, Animal Liberation Front. The Seattle-based Great Ape Project (GAP), founded by Peter Singer, is campaigning for the United Nations to adopt its Declaration on Great Apes, which would see chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orang-utans included in a \\"community of equals\\" with human beings. The declaration wants to extend to the non-human apes the protection of three basic interests: the right to life, the protection of individual liberty, and the prohibition of torture , Great Ape Project. Legal changes influenced by the movement Regarding the campaign to change the status of animals as property, the animal liberation movement has seen success in several countries. In 1992, Switzerland amended its constitution to recognize animals as beings and not things. However, in 1999 the Swiss constitution was completely rewritten. A decade later, Germany guaranteed rights to animals in a 2002 amendment to its constitution, becoming the first European Union member to do so. The German Civil Code had been amended correspondingly in 1997. Perhaps the greatest success of the animal liberation movement has been the granting of basic rights to five great ape species in New Zealand in 1999. Their use is now forbidden in research, testing or teaching. Other governments had also previously implemented a ban on these experiments, such as the UK government in 1986. Some other countries have also banned or severely restricted the use of non-human great apes in research. Also, on May 17, 2013, India declared that all cetaceans have the status of \\"nonhuman persons.\\" In the United States, there is an Animal Welfare Act that was produced in 1966. This law protects animals in acts of research, transportation, and sale. Generally, animals are protected from any torture, neglect, or killing. There have been many amendments made towards this act to keep it updated. While there is only one act covering the entire United States, there are more current laws surrounding animal rights, which vary by state. Strategy and tactical repertoires  = Use of new information communication technologies (ICTs) = New media, such as the Internet and email, have been used by Animal Rights Movement actors and countermovement actors in a variety of capacities. Radical factions in the movement rely on websites, blogs, podcasts, videos, and online forums to engage in vegan outreach and other mobilization efforts and build alliances, thus overcoming exclusion by dominant factions. The use of Internet has allowed the animal rights movement to spread transnationally. For example, the Istanbul Animal Rights Movement's theory and repertoires of contention draw from those of various countries that have spread through the use of Internet. The Internet is also used by activists to build community and avoid stigmatization, and may be a preferred means of activism for marginalized members, such as individuals who are fat. In 2001, Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC), an animal rights group founded in the UK with the aim of ending vivisection practices by Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS), published the names of targets associated with HLS on its website, situating the campaign against HLS in a globally accessible central information source that allowed for increased support and participation by decreasing opportunity cost. SHAC.net listed targets for \\"naming and shaming,\\" emphasized and sent email action alerts, and facilitated written and digital communication between activists and targets. When the UK government later prevented SHAC from publishing reports from the ALF on its website, an activist created the Bite Back website, which was registered in the US and thus allowed the ALF to publish reports without reprisal. Countermovement actors have also used ICTs; law enforcement officers have tracked SHAC activists and admitted electronic communications as evidence in criminal trials. Dylan Barr, who jammed email inboxes at Washington Mutual Bank with 5,000 emails, caused $5,000 in losses and was convicted for extortion. ICTs have facilitated undercover surveillance efforts by activists who use video cameras, Internet, and television to collect and disseminate evidence of cruelty to nonhuman animals, in order to attract publicity to and mobilize support for the movement. = Undercover surveillance = In 1981, Alex Pacheco exposed illicit research on Macaque monkeys in Edward Taub's laboratory in Silver Spring, Maryland. Police raided the research facility, and the raid was televised, attracting publicity to antivivisectionists' claims. In the UK in 1990, Mike Huskisson and Melody McDonald videotaped Wilhelm Feldberg performing illegal research; the video evidence was made public and Feldberg's lab was summarily closed down. SHAC was founded after Zoe Broughton conducted undercover surveillance of vivisectionists and discovered evidence of nonhuman animal abuse. Footage and images from undercover surveillance activity are often circulated offline and on the Internet and used to deliver a moral shock that will mobilize viewers to participate in the movement. Members in the abolitionist faction, specifically those in Francione's camp, argue that the graphic depictions of suffering discovered in undercover work result in a focus on treatment, as opposed to use, and that this focus, while useful in securing welfare reform, is counterproductive to abolishing animal exploitation. =Boycott= Animal liberationists usually boycott industries that use animals. Foremost among these is factory farming,Cruelty To Animals , GoVeg.com. which produces the majority of meat, dairy products, and eggs in industrialized nations. The transportation of farm animals for slaughter, which often involves their live export, has in recent years been a major issue for animal rights groups, particularly in the UK and Scandinavia. The vast majority of animal rights advocates adopt vegetarian or vegan diets.Singer, Peter. Animal Liberation, second edition, Random House, 1975; this edition 1990, p. 160ff. They may also avoid clothes made of animal skins, such as leather shoes, and will not use products known to contain animal byproducts. Goods containing ingredients that have been tested on animals are also avoided where possible. Company-wide boycotts are common. The Procter & Gamble corporation, for example, tests many of its products on animals, leading many animal rights advocates to boycott the company's products entirely, whether tested on animals or not. There is a growing trend in the American movement towards devoting all resources to vegetarian outreach. The 9.8 billion animals killed there for food every year far exceeds the number of animals used in other ways. Groups such as Vegan Outreach and Compassion Over Killing devote their time to exposing factory- farming practices by publishing information for consumers and by organizing undercover investigations. = Moral shocks = Moral shock is a tactic that involves drawing targets' attention to a particular depiction of a situation in order to cause outrage and catalyze targets to support a movement or claim. In the Animal Rights Movement, moral shocks are often used in the form of graphic depictions that detail the brutalization of nonhuman animals. Farm Animal Rights Movement (FARM), a popular animal rights organization, has used moral shocks in its pay-per-view campaign, in which passersby were paid a dollar to watch a graphic video of nonhuman animal suffering. Nonhuman animals depicted in moral shocks often display characteristics similar to those of human infants (e.g., large heads and eyes, crying or whimpering, small, mammalian). There is an ongoing debate within the Movement about the effectiveness of moral shocks. It has been found that many animal rights activists join after being exposed to moral shocks, and that moral shocks given to strangers are more likely to mobilize potential participants than are preexisting social networks; there is research that has found the opposite, however. Conversely, moral shocks that target the public at large (e.g., those used in vegan outreach) are less likely to be effective than those that have targets more distant from and less visible to the public (e.g., vivisectors). = Non-violent action = Non-violent resistance or civil disobedience consists of breaking the law without using violence. This may include the blocking of public roads or entrances, sometimes by chaining or gluing oneself to the ground or to doors. The animal rights movement has espoused these tactics during the 2019 Animal Rebellion protests in London, leading to several dozen arrests. =Direct action= :Timeline of ALF actions: 1976‚Äì1999, 2000‚Äì2004 and 2005‚ÄìPresent A fire, claimed by the Oxford Arson Squad, caused ¬£500,000 damage to Londbridges boathouse, Oxfordshire on July 4, 2005. The movement espouses a number of approaches, and is bitterly divided on the issue of direct action and violence, with very few activists or writers publicly advocating the latter tactic as a justified method to use.Today, interview with Jerry Vlasak, BBC Radio 4, July 26, 2004, cited in Best, Steven. \\"Who's Afraid of Jerry Vlasak?\\" Animal Liberation Press Office, undated. Retrieved January 17, 2008. Most groups reject violence against persons, intimidation, threats, and the destruction of property: for example, the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) and Animal Aid. These groups concentrate on education and research, including carrying out undercover investigations of animal-testing facilities. There is some evidence of cooperation between the BUAV and the ALF: for example, the BUAV used to donate office space for the use of the ALF in London in the early 1980s.Newkirk, Ingrid. Free the animals. Lantern Books, 2000. Other groups do not condemn the destruction of property, or intimidation, but do not themselves engage in those activities, concentrating instead on education, research, media campaigns, and undercover investigations: for example, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). A third category of activists operates using the leaderless resistance model, working in covert cells consisting of small numbers of trusted friends, or of one individual acting alone. These cells engage in direct action: for example by carrying out raids to release animals from laboratories and farms, using names like the Animal Liberation Front (ALF); or by boycotting and targeting anyone or any business associated with the controversial animal testing lab, Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS), using a campaign name like Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC). Some arson, property destruction and vandalism has been linked to various animal rights groups Activists who have carried out or threatened acts of physical violence have operated using the names; Animal Rights Militia (ARM), Justice Department, Revolutionary Cells‚ÄîAnimal Liberation brigade (RCALB), Hunt Retribution Squad (HRS) and the Militant Forces Against Huntingdon Life Sciences (MFAH). Some activists have attempted blackmail and other illegal activities, such as the intimidation campaign to close Darley Oaks farm, which involved hate mail, malicious phonecalls, bomb threats, arson attacks and property destruction, climaxing in the theft of the corpse of Gladys Hammond, the owners' mother-in-law, from a Staffordshire grave. Over a thousand ALF attacks in one year in the UK alone caused ¬£2.6M of damage to property, prompting some experts to state that animal rights now tops the list of causes that prompt violence in the UK.Animal rights, terror tactics, BBC News, 30th August 2007. There are also a growing number of \\"open rescues,\\" in which liberationists enter businesses to remove animals without trying to hide their identities. Open rescues tend to be carried out by committed individuals willing to go to jail if prosecuted, but so far no farmer has been willing to press charges.Anti-terror law 'could trap animal extremists', The Telegraph, 25th October 2005. =Targeting researchers= Activists have targeted individual researchers and have shown up at homes in the middle of the night, threatening their families and children. Overwhelmingly, though, the animal rights movement is peaceful, and instances of violence have been used in efforts to try to tarnish the entire movement.\\"Animal Pride\\" , Animal Aid. Criminalization of direct action methods The U.S. Justice Department labels underground groups the Animal Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front as terrorist organizations., Portland FBI A November 13, 2003 edition of CBS News' 60 Minutes charged that \\"eco-terrorists,\\" a term used by the United States government to refer to the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front, are considered by the FBI to be \\"the country‚Äôs biggest domestic terrorist threat.\\" FBI, ATF address domestic terrorism, CNN, 19th May 2005. John Lewis, a Deputy Assistant Director for Counterterrorism at the FBI, stated in a 60 Minutes interview that these groups \\"have caused over $100 million worth of damage nationwide\\", and that \\"there are more than 150 investigations of eco-terrorist crimes underway\\".Burning Rage, CBS News, 18th June 2006. \\"Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act\\", the legislation which allows federal authorities to \\"help prevent, better investigate, and prosecute individuals who seek to halt biomedical research through acts of intimidation, harassment, and violence\\" was adopted in the USA in 2006. It has also been described as having 'a chilling effect' on free speech.Analysis of the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act.Using \\"terrorism\\" rhetoric to chill free speech and protect corporate profits by WILL POTTER  Inter-movement activity  Animal rights factions address injustices against a variety of groups, therein emphasizing a connection between discrimination against humans and discrimination against nonhuman animals. An intersectional orientation is seen online, on websites and social media, and also in offline activity. In Turkey, animal rights groups commonly join other social movements by aligning with online and offline campaigns. In Istanbul's 2013 Gezi Park protests, which began as an environmental movement against urban development efforts, various social movement groups participated. Among them were animal rights activists that saw the protests as an opportunity to raise concerns about speciesism. Animal rights activists' involvement in the protests changed the opinions of animal rights movement outsiders who had previously viewed vegan animal rights activists as elitist. This allowed for increased legitimacy and network expansion; the animal rights movement in Istanbul is composed of multi- movement actors from the feminist movement, LGBT+ movement, and antimilitarist movement, and such inter-movement interaction has led to increased coverage of veganism and animal rights by leftist news sites in Turkey.  Countermovement  Opposition to the animal rights movement comes from corporate and state actors. Mass media, agribusiness, and biomedicine industries often portray activists in a negative light, characterizing the movement as misanthropic, sensationalist, and dangerous to scientific endeavors and human well-being because of activists' high levels of expressed empathy for nonhuman animals. Mass media also frequently portray nonhuman animals as objects. Major pharmaceutical companies have taken legal measures to disallow protestors from targeting their companies. The abolitionist faction of the Animal Rights Movement often faces counterframing by dominant reformist organizations of the movement that frame radical advocacy as idealistic and schismatic. These reform-oriented nonhuman rights organizations direct resources to countering abolitionist claims and blocking abolitionists' access to discursive spheres. Another example of counterframing from opposition movement actors is found in Switzerland's 1998 referendum cycle, in which antivivisectionists' claims that animal research should be abolished were contested with claims that mobilized the public more. Antivivisection claims, which framed animal research as facilitating the genetic engineering of foods in hopes of seizing on public fear of genetic engineering, were countered by scientists and animal researchers, who framed vivisection as medically necessary to ensure human well-being.

Prior to the twentieth century, it was a liberal nonsectarian college, a grammar school, an academy and then a secondary school. Pictou Academy's current principal is James Ryan. The Pictou Academy Educational Foundation provides additional funds to the school. The original site of the academy was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1937, as it symbolized the introduction of nonsectarian education to The Maritimes in the early 19th century. In 2017 the CCRSB elected a board of supervisors to survey the three schools in the town of Pictou. After a vote in the end process of the surveying the board decided upon closing the building constructed in the 1940s and moving Pictou Academy to the building beside which was formerly known as Dr. Thomas McCulloch Middle School.  History  Pictou Academy On March 26, 1816, the Nova Scotia Legislature enacted legislation to found Pictou Academy.Journal and Proceedings of the [Nova Scotia] House of Assembly, 1816 Thomas McCulloch (1776 - 1843), the first principal (1816 - 1837), was a Presbyterian minister ordained in the Secessionist church in Scotland. He arrived in Pictou in 1803 and by 1806, he had written about the need for a college because King's, the one college in Nova Scotia at that time, was open to only 20% of the population. McCulloch wanted a non sectarian college that would train local ministers and offer to all a liberal scientific curriculum modeled on the University of Glasgow. In 1806 he opened a school in his own house and the excellence of his teaching drew students from Nova Scotia and beyond, but it was not until 1816 that Pictou Academy was opened. McCulloch began to build up its library and collected insect and bird specimens for a natural history museum. This collection was so extensive that John James Audubon, in a visit in 1833, called it \\"The finest private collection in North America.\\" Throughout his years as principal, McCulloch had a constant struggle with government funding, trustees, the status of the Academy, and religious groups, both in Pictou and the province. For many years, the Legislative Assembly approved a grant for the Academy but the Council rejected or reduced the grant. McCulloch fought vigorously for his ideas, but by 1837, he was in a very difficult position and left the Academy to become the first principal of the new Dalhousie College in Halifax. The Academy went through several phases. To 1831 it was a college but after this, a grammar school was added to the college. By 1842, the school had female students and had its college status taken away making it a grammar school only. The school's enrollment ranged widely over the years but by the 1870s, with the changes in school policies in Nova Scotia, the Academy was flourishing and became a model secondary institution with excellent facilities and higher grants. Students passed exams to enter the Academy which was free to county students. From the beginning, the plan was to keep fees low, and some students did attend for free during the early years. The emphasis on an academic curriculum with competition and examinations led to Pictou Academy students taking a larger proportion of prizes and bursaries than any other academy in the province. By 1885 it was the largest secondary school in Nova Scotia with students coming from across the province as well as from other countries. As a result, the Academy has a long list of famous graduates in all walks of life. Many gifts and prizes were left to Pictou Academy by its students and others and in 1916, the centenary committee took on a role of continuing support. In 1919, the committee incorporated itself into the PA Augmentation Fund. Later on, it became The Pictou Academy Educational Foundation. The first building was constructed in 1818 and was used until 1879. A second, larger building opened in 1880 but burned in 1895. The third building also burned and Pictou Academy's current building opened in 1940. Not only was Pictou Academy an important educational institution, but \\"Over it was fought the battle of the nineteenth century against unconstitutional government and religious intolerance. It was largely over the rights and wrongs of the Academy more than any other question that the fight was waged and won for responsible government in Nova Scotia.\\" (MacPhie, 1914, p. 135) Traditions *The Breakup: One of Pictou Academy's oldest traditions is The Breakup. It is essentially a prom, but is rarely referred to as such; instead, students use the traditional title of Breakup. It's a time when all the graduates come together for their final dance as a class. Although other grade levels (nine, ten and eleven) are allowed to attend, the night is designed for the graduates. *The Grand March: Closely tied to The Breakup is The Grand March. All of those couples who will be attending The Breakup arrive in the late afternoon, early evening and line up outside the school . They all move down the walkway arm in arm down the driveway and up the pathway through the lawn and eventually into the school. It's a large event, drawing quite a crowd every year. Sports Some of the students at Pictou Academy are sports enthusiasts. The school has been known to produce a variety of sport teams who have competed up to the provincial level. Some years the school has over twenty different teams with some funding provided by the school. Among the sports regularly available are: *Badminton *Baseball *Basketball *Cross- country *Dragon boat *Golf *Hockey *Rugby *Soccer *Softball *Table Tennis *Track and Field The Pictou Academy sports teams had a successful year in 2010-2011, making it to provincials in golf, basketball, hockey and softball. In the 2012-2013 year, the Senior Girls Basketball team reached the Division 3 provincials for the first time in seven years.

The band was extremely popular in the Soviet Union and has been credited by critics as the Soviet answer to the French band Space who were popular at the time. Biography Zodiac was formed by JƒÅnis L≈´sƒìns, then studying composition at the Latvian State Conservatory in Riga (now JƒÅzeps Vƒ´tols Latvian Academy of Music). The other four members of the group were also students of various faculties of the same conservatory. Zodiac's first vinyl record Disco Alliance (Russian: –î–∏—Å–∫–æ –∞–ª—å—è–Ω—Å, Latvian: Disko alianse) was released in 1980 on the monopolist Melodiya label, during the band members' studentship. The album was produced by Aleksandrs Grƒ´va, who was also the father of band member Zane Grƒ´va. The music featured a lot of then-unusual synthesized sounds and effects together with more conventional euro disco elements. The second album Music in the Universe () released two years later was much inspired by a meeting with cosmonauts in the Star City, Moscow and their tales about space flights. The music of the second album was much more rock-influenced than the first. During that time the band also performed the music of Viktor Vlasov for the films –ñ–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–µ —Ä–∞–¥–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ –ø–µ—á–∞–ª–∏ (Woman's Joys and Sorrows, 1982) and –≠–∫–∏–ø–∞–∂ –º–∞—à–∏–Ω—ã –±–æ–µ–≤–æ–π (The Tank Crew, 1983), the soundtracks for the both films were released on a vinyl record Music from the Films () in 1985. The music of the group was also used in the documentary film about the cosmonaut artist Alexei Leonov –ó–≤—ë–∑–¥–Ω–∞—è –ø–∞–ª–∏—Ç—Ä–∞ (Star Palette, 1982). The album In memoriam was composed and produced by JƒÅnis L≈´sƒìns alone and released in 1989. The album was dedicated to the ancient and modern cultural and natural heritage of Latvia. The sounding of the album turned from disco to light techno/synthpop while gaining a lot of classical music influences as well as the influence of Jean Michel Jarre's ambient works. The last album Clouds' was released in 1991 by RiTonis (former Melodiya). It contains a hit song of the early 1990s in Latvia \\"My favourite flowers\\". Disco Alliance and Music in the Universe were released together on compact disc by Mikrofona Ieraksti (which represents EMI in the Baltic states). In the early 2000s, the Russian electronic duo PPK recorded a remix of Zodiac's composition \\"Zodiac\\" from the Disco Alliance album. This remix, titled \\"Reload\\", entered the charts in a number of territories.

He was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and lived for a few years in Ripley, Tennessee, near the Arkansas border. Because of his chronic asthma condition, his family moved to California when he was seven, eventually settling in the East Hollywood, Los Angeles. When he was 29, he moved to Oakland, California, where he would live for the rest of his life. His novelty song \\"Transfusion\\" was a Top 20 hit in 1956, reaching #13 on Billboard's Hot 100 Chart. A second song, \\"Ape Call,\\" released later that year, also charted and peaked at #28. The lyrics in \\"Transfusion\\" concern a careless reckless driver who repeatedly receives blood transfusion after each accident, and promises each time to never speed again. This novelty song features the sound effects of a vehicle collision. The song was banned on many radio stations in the 1950s. The song was later played on the radio by Barry Hansen, which reportedly led to Hansen's eventual nickname of Dr. Demento. After a brief solo career, which amounted to less than six months, he concentrated on his demo service, providing music for other artists. He charged around seven dollars to make these demos, some of which led to publishing contracts for the songwriters. Drake died at the age of 56 in Alameda County, California of cirrhosis of the liver. His body was donated to the University of California, San Francisco Anatomy Department.

He began a worldwide indigenous church-planting movement in India that grew to more than 10,000 local churches. Singh died on 17 September 2000, in Hyderabad, India.Bakht Singh, an Apostle of Christ from India Early life Bakht Singh was born to religious Sikh parents Shri. Lal Jawahar Mal and Smt. Lakshmi Bai Joya in 1903 in Joiya village, Sargodha District of the Punjab, British India. He studied in a Christian missionary school. He was actively involved in social work through the Sikh temple. He was married to Rama Bai at the age of 12, on 6 June 1915. After graduating from Punjab University he went to England for higher studies in 1926 and studied Agricultural Engineering. His parents were not in favour of him going to England; they were concerned that he would be influenced by Christians. Bakht Singh promised his parents that he would not be converted. Brother Bakht Singh Website Life in England and Canada In England, he enjoyed the freedom of, and was greatly influenced by, the British lifestyle. He quickly adapted to this lifestyle, started smoking and drinking, travelled around Europe, and indulged in all kinds of fun and entertainment. He shaved his long hair, breaking kesh, or the practice of Sikhism to allow one's hair to grow naturally out of respect for the perfection of the creation of Waheguru. Years later he went to Kings College in London, and in 1929, Bakht Singh went to Canada and continued his studies in agricultural engineering at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He was befriended by John and Edith Hayward, local residents and devout Christians, who invited him to live with them. The Haywards always read the Bible at every supper; they also gave him a Bible. He liked their company and he visited church and started reading the Bible. After seeking for some time, he became Christian and was baptized on 4 February 1932 in Vancouver, British Columbia.Koshy, T.E. \\"Bakht Singh of India\\". Authentic Publishing, 1 March 2008. Christian work in India Bakht Singh returned to India in 1933 and met his parents in Bombay. He had earlier informed his parents about his conversion by a letter. Reluctantly, they accepted him but requested him to keep it a secret for the sake of the family's honour. Upon his refusal, they left him. Suddenly, he was homeless. But he started preaching in the streets of Bombay. Soon he started attracting large crowds. Bakht Singh began speaking as a fiery itinerant preacher and revivalist throughout colonial India, gaining a large following. He at first preached as an Anglican evangelist before becoming independent. \\"Singh's role in the 1937 revival that swept the Martinbur United Presbyterian Church inaugurated one of the most notable movements in the history of the church in the Indian subcontinent,\\" stated Jonathan Bonk in Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions published by Simon & Schuster Macmillan in 1998.Bonk, Jonathan. \\"Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions\\". Published by MacMillan, 1998. He started thoroughly contextualized local assemblies patterned on New Testament principles after spending a night in prayer on a mountaintop at Pallavaram, Chennai in 1941. He held his first \\"Holy Convocation\\", based on Leviticus 23, in Madras in 1941. After this, the convocations were held annually in Madras and Hyderabad in the south, and in Ahmedabad and Kalimpong in the north. The one in Hyderabad was always the largest, drawing up to 25,000 participants. They would eat and sleep in huge tents, and meet under a large thatched pandal for hours-long prayer, praise and teaching meetings that began at dawn and ended late at night. The care and feeding of guests was handled by volunteers. Expenses for the meetings were given by voluntary offerings; no appeals were issued. Bro Bakht Singh expounded on believer-priesthood. All believers are equal in the sight of God. Testimonies J. Edwin Orr, a British Church historian: \\"Brother Bakht Singh is an Indian equivalent of the greater Western evangelists, as skillful as Finney and as direct as Dwight L. Moody. He is a first-class Bible teacher of the order of G. Campbell Morgan or Graham Scroggie.\\" Dave Hunt, an apologetics writer: \\"The arrival of Bakht Singh turned the churches of Madras upside down. . . . Crowds gathered in the open air, as many as 12,000 on one occasion to hear this man of God. Many seriously ill were healed when Bakht Singh prayed for them, even deaf and dumb began to hear and speak.\\" Bob Finley, President of Christian Aid Mission: \\"I have never seen a man who has a greater knowledge and understanding of the Bible than Bakht Singh. All our Western preachers and teachers seem to be children before this great man of God.\\" Norman Grubb missionary statesman, author and teacher: \\"In all my missionary experience I think these churches on their New Testament foundations are the nearest I have seen to a replica of the early church and a pattern for the birth and growth of the young churches in all the countries which we used to talk about as mission fields.\\" Jonathan Bonk: \\"Singh's role in the 1937 revival that swept the Martinbur United Presbyterian Church inaugurated one of the most notable movements in the history of the church in the Indian subcontinent.\\" Ravi Zacharias, Indian-born Christian teacher and apologist: \\"I was a young Christian when I heard of Bakht Singh. His impact for Christ in India and worldwide has been immense.\\" Death Grave of Bakht singh On 17 September 2000, Singh died in his sleep and was buried at Christian Cemetery, Narayanguda. The funeral was attended by nearly 250,000 people.

A battlegroup is formed around an infantry battalion or armoured regiment, which is usually commanded by a lieutenant colonel. The battalion or regiment also provides the command and staff element of a battlegroup, which is complemented with an appropriate mix of armour, infantry and support personnel and weaponry, relevant to the task it is expected to perform. The organisation of a battlegroup is flexible, and can be restructured quickly to cope with any changes in the situation. Typically, an offensive battlegroup may be structured around an armoured regiment, with two squadrons of main battle tanks supported by an infantry company; conversely, a more defensive battlegroup may be structured around an infantry battalion, with two companies and an armoured squadron. In support would be a reconnaissance troop, a low- level air defence detachment, an anti-tank section and engineering detachment, plus artillery support. Battlegroups are often subdivided into company groups (called \\"teams\\" in the U.S. Army) consisting of a single infantry company supported by a tank troop and various other support units. United Kingdom and Commonwealth In the British Army, an armoured or mechanised division could expect to have as many as twelve separate battlegroups at its disposal, with three or four in each brigade. A Commonwealth battle group is usually named after its major constituent; for example, the Canadian Army's \\"1st Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment Battle Group\\" (shortened to \\"1 RCR Battle Group\\") on an operational tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2007‚Äì08, and the British Army's \\"3 Para Battle Group\\" that was operational in Afghanistan in 2011. India India, with the adoption of the Cold Start Doctrine, has come up with independent brigade groups a little larger in composition than a task force. It is composition mix of all elements for specific war purpose against Pakistan. Offensive elements comprise independent armed brigade groups (usually composed of armour units) and independent offensive brigade groups (usually composed of infantry); the Indian Army has substantially reduced the time it took to deploy its forces on its borders. South Africa In the South African Army development of semi-independent battlegroups developed mainly out of the experiences of Task Force Juliet with a focus on high mobility speed and distance in the vastness of the South West African/Southern Angolan theater.

It was established in 1933 by Edwin Richard Foden from whose initials the company was named. Its factory in Middlewich closed in March 2002, and it was discontinued as a marque by owner MAN in July 2007. History Preserved 1947 ERF Preserved B Series 2001 ERF ECX (second generation) ERF Trailblazer bus in South Africa In 1881, the first Foden traction engine was built in Sandbach. Then in 1898, Edwin Richard Foden influenced future truck design by designing the first steam wagon running on steel tyre wheels which had been successful until 1913 when vulcanised solid rubber tyre development had advanced to the stage of allowing their fitment on heavy vehicles. Edwin introduced the first pneumatic tyred Foden steam wagon, but as steam transport appeared to be going out of favour, Edwin turned his attention to the development of a 6 to 8 ton chassis fitted with new Gardner LW (Light Weight) high speed oil engine. At the beginning of the 1930s, Britain's industry was struggling to survive the worst recession in many years and unemployment exceeded two million. At this time insurers were becoming increasingly reluctant to underwrite steam boilers. As a result, Edwin believed the future of the lorry building industry lay in diesel engine power. The Foden boardroom did not agree, and consequently he resigned along with his son Dennis. With the help of his son Dennis and two former colleagues, including Ernest Sherratt who became Chief Engineer, Edwin worked to build the first ERF diesel lorry in 1933, and gave the first chassis the number 63 which was Edwin's age. From the beginning, the company bought components only from other suppliers rather than manufacture itself, including engines from Gardner, gearboxes from David Brown and axles from Kirkstall Forge Engineering. This concept would serve ERF well throughout its existence. A new cab was styled by Sandbach coachbuilder John Henry Jennings, who also provided initial factory space to assemble the new lorry. Based in Sandbach, the company made its own chassis and cab. The cab structure was made in Northampton at Air Flow Streamlines and fitted out by ERF in Sandbach.

However, when recession came in the beginning of the 1980s, and production fell from a total output of 4,000 chassis per annum, CFE was sold to management to eventually become Saxon Sanbec. ERF was never a major manufacturer; as an example its domestic sales total reached only 1,083 trucks in 1981.

Since the vowel quality of a tone is determined by the overtones, spectrum, or timbre of that tone (all three terms describe approximately the same hearing experience), a spectral glide is a move from a spectrum characteristic of one vowel to a spectrum characteristic of another vowel. A spectral glide may be accomplished through a wah-wah, mute, or pedal, or through the modification of one's vocal tract while speaking, singing, or playing an instrument such as the didgeridoo. Lip-vibrated instruments with large mouthpieces such as tuba and trombone allow extensive modification of vowel quality, while woodwinds have a smaller range, with the exception of the flute in air-sound mode. Strings have the smallest range (Erickson 1975, p. 72). The glide rate and the vowel contrasts used are important factors in the compositional use of spectral glides.

The treaty was signed at Fort McIntosh (present Beaver, Pennsylvania) on January 21, 1785. It contained 10 articles and an addendum. In a follow up to the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784), where the Seneca nation had given up claims in the eastern extension of Ohio Country in northern Pennsylvania, the American government sought a treaty with the remaining tribes having claims in the Ohio Country. The United States sent a team of diplomats including George Rogers Clark, Richard Butler, and Arthur Lee to negotiate a new treaty. In January 1785, the representatives of the two sides met at Fort McIntosh at the confluence of the Ohio and Beaver Rivers. Most of the Native Americans who signed the treaty were not given authority by their nations to make negotiations. Connecticut (Western Reserve in the northeast) and Virginia (Military District in the central south) had residual claims in Ohio Country and would have to be distinguished from Indian Country. Among the only known incursions of the Whiteman in Ohio Country were the U.S. revolutionary fort Fort Laurens in the east, and the old British trading post, Fort Pickawillany in the west. Essentially, the treaty carved a large Indian reservation out of Ohio Country, whose boundaries were the Cuyahoga and Muskingum rivers in the east, a line between Fort Laurens and Fort Pickawillany (Piqua) in the south, the Great Miami River and St. Mary's River in the west, and Maumee River and Lake Erie in the north. The area comprised about 1/3 of modern day Ohio in the northwest, and a wedge of eastern Indiana extending to Kekionga (future Fort Wayne). Areas outside the boundary in eastern and southern Ohio belonged to the Whiteman. The tribes also ceded areas surrounding Fort Detroit and Fort Michilimackinac to the United States and gave back captives taken in raids along the frontier. Most Ohio Country tribes did not subscribe to the treaty, particularly the Shawnee who lost all of their lands in southwestern Ohio. The treaty seeded the formation of the Western Confederacy later the same year. Settlers as well as Indians encroaching on the boundary line presaged the Northwest Indian War. An almost identical Treaty line, except the extension in Indiana, was later circumscribed in the Treaty of Greenville following the conclusion of the war.

The winning design was by noted local architects Harkness & Geddes in collaboration with Walter Gropius, who founded The Architects Collaborative (TAC), the famous Boston architectural firm.William McKenzie Woodward and Edward F Sanderson; Providence, a Citywide Survey of Historical Resources; Rhode Island Historic Preservation Commission, 1986 William McKenzie Woodward, a well-known architectural historian and staff member of the Rhode Island Historical Preservation & Heritage Commission, does not agree aesthetically with the building, going so far as to write in his Guide to Providence Architecture, \\"It's no wonder Modernism has gotten such a bad reputation in Rhode Island because it smells very bad there.\\" In 1986 McKenzie had however admitted in his survey for the Preservation Commission that \\"The new complex, the first of its kind in Providence built to serve a stable rather than expanding population, was well received as an ample and functional facility.\\" Quoting John Ware Lincoln, then chairman of the Division of Design at Rhode Island School of Design as having noted: \\"The new Classical buildings are fine architecture, by the old standards, but they are also exemplary of the new concept of the architect as an environmental planner, working with social and civic sciences, demography, transportation engineering, building technologies, and, in this case, education philosophy.\\" The previous building, designed by Martin & Hall, was a yellow brick building with a peaked roof (under which was the study hall). It was considerably smaller and was bounded by Pond Street, which was consumed in the creation of the new campus. When the old building was razed the yellow bricks were sold to students and alumni.

The simplest dendralene is buta-1,3-diene (1) or [2]dendralene followed by [3]dendralene (2), [4]dendralene (3) and [5]dendralene (4) and so forth. [2]dendralene (butadiene) is the only one not cross-conjugated. :Meet the dendralenes The name dendralene is pulled together from the words dendrimer, linear and alkene. The higher dendralenes are of scientific interest because they open up a large array of new organic compounds from a relatively simple precursor especially by Diels-Alder chemistry. Their cyclic counterparts are aptly called radialenes. Synthesis Vinylbutadiene ([3]dendralene) was first prepared in 1955 by pyrolysis of a triacetate: :Vinyl butadiene synthesis Baily 1955 This compound reacts with two equivalents of maleic anhydride in a tandem DA reaction: :Reaction vinylbutadiene maleic anhydride With benzoquinone the reaction product was a linear polymer. Several syntheses of substituted [3]dendralenes have been reported, one via an allene, one via a Horner‚ÄìWadsworth‚ÄìEmmons reaction, one via a cross-coupling reaction and one from an allylic carbonate. One synthetic route to [4]dendralene starts from chloroprene. This compound is converted to a Grignard reagent by action of magnesium metal which is then reacted with copper(I) chloride to an organocopper intermediate which is in turn dimerized using copper(II) chloride in an oxidative coupling reaction to give the butadiene dimer called [4]dendralene. :[4]dendralene synthetic scheme from chloroprene The gas-phase molecular structure of [4]dendralene has been reported The [8]-dendralene compound was reported in 2009: :[8]-dendralene synthesis in a successive Kumada‚ÄìTamao‚ÄìCorriu coupling and Negishi coupling. A series of [9] to [12]-dendralenes has been reported in 2016 Properties Even-membered dendralenes (e.g. [6]dendralene, [8]dendralene) tend to behave as chains of decoupled and isolated diene units. The ultraviolet absorption maxima equal that of butadiene itself. The dendralenes with an odd number of alkene units are more reactive due to the presence of favorable s-cis diene conformations and Diels-Alder reactions take place more easily with a preference for the termini.  Reactions With simple dienophiles, dendrales can give quick access to complex molecules in Diels-Alder reactions. Several reaction schemes have been reported [4]dendralene shows a tandem Diels-Alder reaction with the dienophile N-methyl-maleimide (NMM). Complete site selectivity is possible with the addition of the Lewis acid methyldichloroaluminium. With one set of premixing and 2 equivalents of NMM, the central diene group is targeted to the monoadduct 3. With another set and a larger amount of dienophile, the terminal groups react and the reaction proceeds from the monoadduct to the trisadducts 2 and 2b. dendralene Diels-Alder reaction One reaction variation is cyclopropanation to a compound class called ivyanes with a reported synthesis in a Simmons‚ÄìSmith reaction (diethyl zinc / trifluoroacetic acid) of the first 6 members. These 1,1-oligocyclopropanes are stable (except when exposed to acids) and have a large heat of combustion with [6]ivyane exceeding that of cubane. The oligocyclopropane chains adopt a helical conformation. For [3]dendralene a photochemical cyclisation reaction has been reported Derivatives A bicyclic [4]dendralene compound has been reported.

A character who has been mainly featured as an enemy of Spider-Man, his entire body is composed of bees surrounding his skeleton. Publication history Swarm first appeared in Champions #14 (July 1977). He was created by Bill Mantlo and John Byrne. Fictional character biography Fritz von Meyer was born in Leipzig, Germany and became one of Adolf Hitler's top scientists specializing in toxicology and melittology. Escaping capture after World War II, he became a beekeeper or apiarist in South America and discovered a colony of mutated bees. Intrigued by their intelligence and passive nature, von Meyer attempted to enslave the queen bee, but failed and the bees devoured him, leaving only his skeleton. The bees' unique qualities caused his consciousness to be absorbed into them, allowing von Meyer to manipulate the hive to do his will, although some of his skeletal remains are inside the swarm itself. His consciousness merged with the hive to the extent that they are one being, calling himself/themselves \\"Swarm\\". Swarm battled the Champions.Champions #14‚Äì15 (1977) After being defeated, Swarm resurfaced to battle the original Spider-Man (Peter Parker).Spectacular Spider-Man #36‚Äì37 In the first of many fights, Spider-Man prevailed against him by dosing his own costume in a new type of insecticide that hurt the bees if they got too close to the web-slinger. Swarm lost his/their skeleton in this battle, but returned to fight again (no longer having the skeleton but still possessing von Meyer's consciousness), first teaming with Kraven the Hunter against Iceman and Firestar,Spider-Man Family Amazing Friends #1 then against Spider-Man,Lethal Foes of Spider-Man #3‚Äì4 but feedback from a weapon fired by the Rhino caused Swarm's bee body to disperse temporarily. Swarm next appears when a Super- Collider from Rand Industries is activated and called his/their attention.Secret Defenders #18 Swarm decides mankind should be exterminated so insects can rule the world. Doctor Druid convinced Swarm that mankind will exterminate themselves and the age of insects can begin.Secret Defenders #19 Eventually, Swarm became tired of waiting and returned to New York, after a psychic wave generated by Onslaught disrupted the psychic field that bonded him and his bees together. He forced a group of scientists investigating energy fields to help him not only restore his original field, but expand it to grant him control of every bee on Earth. As New York City is invaded by bees, the second Spider-Man (Ben Reilly) tracked the bees to their destination and ‚Äî taking advantage of the fact that the swarms' instinctive memory of Peter's use of Raid caused them to automatically flinch away from Spider-Man ‚Äî infiltrated the building to contact the scientists. By claiming that the scientists' equipment is having trouble broadcasting a sufficiently powerful signal through the dome of bees, Spider-Man is able to trick Swarm into allowing the construction of a device designed to negate the vibrational frequency that the bees create to allow themselves to fly, presenting it as a means of boosting the power of the existing signal. With the bees now grounded, Spider-Man subsequently recovers the queen of Swarm's hive and leaves her in the care of the authorities, reasoning that without her, Swarm won't be a future threat.Sensational Spider-Man #9‚Äì10 Now back with an internal skeleton, Swarm felt that the fall of the criminal organization Pride allowed access to their former territory, specifically Los Angeles. However, he/they are defeated by the Runaways, protectors of the city, when his/their body of bees' mental link is disrupted by electrical blasts.Runaways vol. 2 #7 Swarm regained control over his colony and joins the Chameleon's Exterminators to kill Spider-Man now that Parker's true identity is revealed. Swarm attacks Mary Jane Watson but Mary Jane sprays Swarm with water while a co-worker smashes Swarm's skeleton, but the bees reformed around the skeleton as Stark Industries' bodyguards take him/them away. When Alyosha Kravinoff began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans, Swarm is in one of the cages.The Punisher War Journal vol. 2 #15 He fought Gargoyle as the Punisher passes them and escaped. Swarm next turns up in Denver, Colorado, having amassed enough bees to become giant-sized. The Thunderbolts face him/them unsuccessfully until Norman Osborn dispatches Venom devouring Swarm's bones. Osborn speculated this was, by now, a minor inconvenience that shouldn't prevent Swarm's return.Thunderbolts #122 Next, Swarm turns up in Buenos Aires having his intelligence again. He fought the Mighty Avengers by creating 'avatars' made of bees. Notably, the Avengers roster included the Wasp, Stature and Amadeus Cho. Stature placed an inhibitor collar on the queen bees which caused Swarm's intelligence to somehow disperse.Mighty Avengers #24 He was briefly seen trying to launch an attack of the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning only to be almost instantly thwarted by the X-Men's Krakoa, the Bamfs, and Doop.Wolverine and the X-Men #18 Swarm later formed his own incarnation of the Sinister Six with 8-Ball, Delilah, Killer Shrike, Melter and Squid. They attack Spider-Man and the students of the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Swarm gets dispersed by Hellion which caused the other members to surrender.Spider-Man and the X-Men #4 Swarm later attacked New York but was defeated by Squirrel Girl and her ally Koi Boi covering him with water and turning bags full of his constituent bees in to the police.Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #7 Swarm later appeared as a member of the Hateful Hexad alongside Bearboarguy, Gibbon, Ox, Squid and White Rabbit. During the disastrous battle against Spider-Man and Deadpool, the battle is crashed by Itsy Bitsy.Spider-Man/Deadpool #9 Swarm relocates to Florida, where he encounters Macrothrax and his minions, like him sentient insect colonies in humanoid form, accidentally created by the invention which created him. He ends up joining forces with Ant-Man and taking a liking to him.Ant-Man #1-#2 (February & March 2020) Powers and abilities Swarm is a composite being of hundreds of thousands of bees driven by a human intelligence. He is technically intangible, as his body is merely an aggregate of tiny forms. He can fly through the air and assume any shape and size he desires. He can mentally influence the actions of other bees, the full range of which may extend over hundreds of yards in radius. With the aid of a team of scientists, Swarm was briefly able to enhance his power to the point where he could have theoretically taken control of every bee on Earth, but this plan was averted by Spider-Man. At first, Swarm seemed capable of only controlling other bees, but he has exhibited the ability to communicate/control other insects as well. Fritz von Meyer's skeleton, the focal point of his consciousness, remained behind as his only remains until being devoured by Venom. Other versions =Marvel Fairy Tales= In the second issue of the Spider-Man line of Marvel Fairy Tales (an adaptation of the legend of Anansi), an alternate version of Swarm appears as the stories' main villain, the Bee Spirit. =Marvel Adventures= Swarm recently appeared and fought Spider-Man in Marvel Adventures. He/they supposedly wanted to take over the world (or at least kill a few jocks), but it looked like he/they just wanted some ice cream.Marvel Adventures #38 =Ultimate Marvel= The Ultimate Marvel equivalent of Swarm is Petra Laskov, a Syrian female mutant who initially appears as a member of The Liberators and later under the Red-Wasp title as members of the Avengers.Ultimate Avengers #5Ultimates 2 #9 =Marvel Noir= The Marvel Noir universe's equivalent is Madame Sturm, a Nazi scientist.

In Swarm's self-titled episode, the meteorite grants a swarm of bees sentience as well as the ability to increase other bees' size and mutate humans into insect hybrid drones. It attempts to spread its hive mind throughout the universe until Spider-Man, Firestar and Iceman intervene and launch the meteorite back into space to reverse Swarm's effects. * An adapted iteration of Swarm renamed Michael Tan appears in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series, voiced by Eric Bauza (in \\"Swarm\\"), and by Drake Bell (in \\"Sandman Returns\\"). This version utilizes a swarm of self-replicating nanobots. Debuting in his self-titled episode, Tan started out as a disgruntled and immature employee of Stark Industries. He worked on a device to control technology only to be fired by Iron Man. He activates the device in retaliation which fuses his molecules with Spider-Man's spider-tracer which activates when Spider-Man attempted to use it on Juggernaut. Taking the name Swarm, he attempted to assimilate Iron Man's technology, but Spider-Man and Iron Man are able to defeat him using the former's spider-tracer and the latter's arc reactor to amplify a nullifying frequency. With Swarm neutralized, Iron Man confiscates his nanobots so he can attempt to reconfigure him. In \\"Sandman Returns\\", Swarm attempts to assimilate S.H.I.E.L.D. technology, but is defeated by Spider-Man and Sandman. In \\"HYDRA Attacks\\" Pt. 1, Swarm is a prisoner on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier before Doctor Octopus's miniature Octobot combined with Swarm's nanobots to convert the headquarters into Arnim Zola's HYDRA Island. * The Fritz von Meyer incarnation of Swarm appears in Marvel Super Hero Adventures, voiced by Ian James Corlett. * The Swarm identity appears in Spider-Man: Maximum Venom as the alter-ego of Jefferson Davis (voiced by Alex Desert). This version utilizes purple nanotech bees that grant him a solid form and can use their stingers to mind control human beings as well as the leader of an underground gladiatorial arena-based streaming show. =Novels= * In the comic book adaptation of the 2018 Spider-Man video game, Spider-Man: City at War, the Symbiotic Warfare Anthophila Restraining Model (S.W.A.R.M.) appears.Spider- Man: City At War #2 =Toys= * An action figure of Swarm (Fritz von Meyer) was released in 1997 as part of the Spider-Man: Spider Force toy line. It was molded in a translucent yellow plastic, and featured a removable cape and hood, and snap-on bee armor which could also be assembled to create a 'giant' bee accessory. =Theatre= * Fritz von Meyer's iteration of Swarm appears in the Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, played by Gerald Avery. He is featured as a member of the Sinister Six. Reception In August 2009, TIME listed Swarm as one of the \\"Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters\\".

Resor (pronounced REE-zor), president of the J. W. Thompson advertising agency and one of the originators of the modern advertising industry. While still a teenager he changed his name from Stanley Burnet Resor Jr. to Stanley Rogers Resor. Resor graduated from Yale University after attending the Groton School, and graduated from in 1939, where he was tapped to join Scroll and Key. He went on to Yale Law School where he was a contemporary of Sargent Shriver (also a member of Scroll and Key), Gerald Ford, and Cyrus Vance (who preceded him as Secretary of the Army and himself was a member of Scroll and Key and in the same year at Yale). Resor's education was interrupted by service as an Army officer in World War II (1942‚Äì1946), where he was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart.  Career  After the war, Resor went to work on Wall Street, and was made partner in the prominent Debevoise & Plimpton law firm. In 1965 during the Vietnam War, President Lyndon Johnson appointed him Secretary of the Army and he remained in the position under President Richard Nixon until 1971.

It is served by the Maple Leaf train between Toronto and New York City and is the terminus of GO Transit's Lakeshore West line towards Toronto. History Amtrak Maple Leaf train at Niagara Falls station The Victorian Gothic Revival style station was built as the terminus for Great Western Railway (1879‚Äì1882) and Grand Trunk Railway (1882‚Äì1923). The station was renovated in 1951 and the east wing was partially demolished in 1967. It was later acquired by CN Rail for passenger service from 1923 until the 1970s since when it has been used by Via Rail and more recently by GO Transit since 2009. In 2012, as a result of federal funding cuts Via Rail Corridor trips between Toronto and Niagara Falls were discontinued, leaving only the single daily Via/Amtrak Maple Leaf service between Toronto and New York. In October 2012, the ticket agent was eliminated, replaced by an automated kiosk. GO Transit operated summer 'excursion' trains to Niagara Falls on weekends and holidays in 2009 and 2010, making them permanently recurring in 2011. Starting in January 2019, it also began operating a single weekday train trip to and from Niagara Falls. In September 2019, the formerly summer-only weekend train service was extended year-round. GO Transit was expected to expand full-time rail service along the Niagara Branch to Niagara Falls by 2023 and with it upgrades to the station. Services Amtrak and Via Rail jointly operate the Maple Leaf train service between Toronto and New York. It uses Amtrak trainsets, but ticketing is shared, and a Via Rail crew operates the train along the Toronto‚ÄìNiagara Falls leg of the route. The station is served once daily in each direction. In March 2020, Maple Leaf service at the station was suspended indefinitely as part of a closure of the border to non-essential travel in response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, with trains truncated to Niagara Falls, New York. GO Transit operates the Lakeshore West commuter rail line between Toronto and Niagara Falls. The station is served by one peak-direction GO Transit train per weekday, and 3 to 4 trains throughout the day on weekends and holidays. Customs There are no pre-clearance facilities here or on the American side. For passengers coming from the US, Canada Border Services Agency officers process passengers on the train. For trains to the US, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers handle passengers upon entry into the US at the Niagara Falls Station and Customhouse Interpretive Center in Niagara Falls, New York just over the Whirlpool Bridge.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1977 to 1987, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Bill Davis and Frank Miller. Baetz was a member of the Progressive Conservative Party. Background Baetz was born in Chesley, Ontario. His father was a Lutheran minister, and Baetz remained a Lutheran throughout his life. He was educated at Wilfrid Laurier University (then Waterloo Lutheran Seminary, affiliated with the University of Western Ontario),Laurier Alumni Association, \\"Laurier 100: 100 Alumni of Distinction\\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqHzh3k-cmA). Columbia University in New York, and the University of Toronto. He became a social worker and assisted in the reconstruction of Germany and Hungary after World War II. Before entering provincial politics, he was a member of the Ontario Economic Council, the Canada Manpower and Immigration Council and the Canadian Association of Social Workers. He led the Canadian Council of Social Development from 1963 to 1977. Politics He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1977 provincial election, defeating Liberal Bill Roberts by 5,373 votes in Ottawa West. He entered Bill Davis's cabinet on January 21, 1978 as Minister of Energy, and was named Minister of Culture and Recreation on August 18, 1978. Baetz was easily re-elected in the 1981 election, and was named as Minister of Tourism and Recreation on February 13, 1982. He supported Roy McMurtry to succeed Davis as party leader in January 1985. When Frank Miller replaced Davis a premier of Ontario on February 8, 1985, he named Baetz as Provincial Secretary for Justice. He was again re-elected in the 1985 election, defeating Liberal candidate Alex Cullen by 2,948 votes. At the provincial level, Miller's Conservatives were reduced to a fragile minority government in the 1985 election. Baetz was appointed as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs on May 17, 1985, but accomplished little in this portfolio before the Conservatives were defeated in the house in June 1985. In opposition, he served as his party's critic for Intergovernmental Affairs, Child Care and Social Policy. He did not seek re-election in 1987. =Cabinet positions= Later life Baetz died on October 28, 1996. The Ontario legislative paid tribute to Baetz on November 4, 1996.

In 1994 together with the MIT research team led by P.M. Tedrow and R. Meservey, they showed a practical way to implement room temperature magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) using a magnetic stack based on CoFe‚ÄìAl2O3‚ÄìCo, demonstrating a tunnel magnetoresistance ratio (TMR) of 11.8%. Low temperature magnetoresistive tunneling had been discovered by Michel Julliere in 1975 but it would be more than a decade before a room temp system was found. In 1991, Terunobu Miyazaki and others at Tohoku University had demonstrated a MTJ with room temp TMR of 2.7%, but this effect was too small to be of use in practical devices. In 1994, Miyazaki's team, working independently of Mersevey/Moodera's, also developed a room temperature MTJ with high TMR (18.0%) based on an Fe‚ÄìAl2O3‚ÄìFe stack, thus garnering recognition as co-developer of room temp magnetoresistive tunnelling along with Mersevey/Moodera. Besides its great fundamental interest, room temperature magnetoresistive tunnelling is the basis for practical devices including MRAM and read heads used in hard disks. Moodera was named a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2000 \\"for pioneering and sustained contributions to the understanding of spin-polarized transport in solids.\\" Before investigating ferromagnetic tunneling, Moodera worked for many years on spin-polarized tunneling in superconductor junctions along with Bob Meservey and Paul Tedrow.

In that role, Haksar was the chief strategist and policy adviser behind his inexperienced prime minister's rise to near-absolute power in the mid-1970s. After this he was appointed deputy chairman of the Planning Commission and then the first-ever chancellor of New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University. An advocate of centralisation and socialism, he was a Kashmiri Pandit who became Gandhi's closest confidante in her inner coterie of bureaucrats, the so-called \\"Kashmiri mafia\\". Prior to this, Haksar was a diplomat of the Indian Foreign Service, who served as India's ambassador to Austria and Nigeria. Personal life Haksar was born in 1913, Gujranwala (now in Pakistan) in a Kashmiri Pandit family. He studied Sanskrit at home and obtained an M.Sc. from University of Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh. He went on to study in the London School of Economics. As a student of Allahabad university, he was a resident of Mayo Hall and made frequent visits to the Anand Bhawan, the house of Motilal Nehru. Parmeshwar was a voracious reader of art history and also a connoisseur of paintings. During his interlude in London as a student, he was influenced by Fabian socialism and later become associated with Marxists. During the latter years of his life, Haksar became associated with the Delhi Science Forum, initiatives on human rights, and opposition to neo-liberal policies and secularism. He lost his eyesight during the last 10 years of his life. Haksar died at the age of 85, on 25 November 1998.Praful Bidwai. \\"The last of the Nehruvians\\". Frontline. 19 December 1998. Career As Indira Gandhi's (pictured) principal secretary, Haksar helped a beleaguered and inexperienced prime minister's rise to near-absolute power. =Early career= Haksar had already made his mark as a prominent lawyer in Allahabad, before he was selected in the Indian Foreign Service in 1947, and was close to fellow-Kashmiri from Allahabad Jawaharlal Nehru, the latter who would go on to become independent India's first prime minister. A one-time student at the London School of Economics, he was a junior colleague of V. K. Krishna Menon at the India League in London. =Civil services= P. N. Haksar served as the India ambassador to Nigeria and Austria. In the 1960s, he also served as a deputy high commissioner in London. After twenty years in the Indian foreign service, he was appointed as an aide to the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi. In 1967, he replaced L. K. Jha as Secretary to the Prime Minister of India, and was promoted to the newly formed post of Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister of India in 1971, thus becoming the most powerful and senior civil servant in the prime minister's office. He authored the 'Stray Thoughts Memorandum' at the Congress Working Committee meeting in Bangalore which ultimately led to the defenestration of her political rivals such as like Morarji Desai.. Until he vacated the position of Principal Secretary to Indira Gandhi, Haksar exercised significant influence on the formulation of domestic and foreign policies in Raisina Hill. As Principal Secretary, Haksar fashioned Indira Gandhi's decision about the timing and level of support to be given to Bangladeshi freedom struggle, issuing directives from her private office to the top military leadership in some cases. =Administrator and strategist= Haksar was noted for his strategising on the nationalisation of banks, insurance firms and foreign-owned oil companies, the 1971 Indo-Soviet Treaty and India's support to the liberation of what would become Bangladesh. He is also the chief architect of the Shimla Agreement with Pakistan, as he was of the creation of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW;), India's foreign secret intelligence agency =Refusal of Padma Vibhushan= Upon his retirement from the civil service in 1973, Indira Gandhi offered Haksar India's second highest civilian honour, the Padma Vibhushan, for his numerous distinguished services to India; however, in a letter to Govind Narain he declined the honour stating that \\"Accepting an award for work done somehow causes an inexplicable discomfort to me.\\" The prime minister duly rescinded her offer.

Tens of thousands of volunteers and troops responded or were deployed to the disaster - most in the affected area but also throughout the U.S. at shelters set up in at least 19 states. Overview Monetary donations were way below the records set by the tsunami and 9/11 relief efforts in the U.S. In a reversal of usual positions, the U.S. received international aid and assistance from numerous countries. The National Disaster Medical System had activated essentially all teams in the country, and pre-staged multiple Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs), Disaster Mortuary Assistance Teams (DMORTs), and Veterinary Medicine Response Teams (VMATs) in Houston and Atlanta the day prior to, and the day of, landfall. When the levees were reported to have broken, the DMATs were moved to Baton Rouge on Tuesday, August 30, and as the needs were identified, teams were moved out that afternoon to the Super Dome, and that night to the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. Three DMATs arrived around 0200 hours on Wednesday morning, Aug 31, and set up a field hospital Base of Operations in Concourse D, and began offloading rescuees from helicopters, and providing all levels of medical care. Additional DMATs were deployed there as the volume and tempo of patient arrivals increased, as the hospitals in the city began to evacuate their patients. Over 3,000 patients were cared for, and as DOD Medevac assets began arriving, patients were handed over and moved out to over a dozen cities. This operation peaked during the weekend of September 3 and 4, and was completed by mid-week. Over 20,000 evacuees were also flown out by the civilian air-fleet drafted into service, and 25 deaths occurred there, mostly elderly nursing home and hospice evacuees. More than 1,000 Army and Air National Guardsmen and 7,200 active-duty troops were stationed in the Gulf Coast region to assist with hurricane relief operations with some remaining several weeks.https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050903/ap_on_re_us/katrina_national_guard The military relief effort, known as Joint Task Force Katrina, was commanded by Lieutenant General Russel L. Honor√©, commander of the U.S. First Army. At President Bush's urging, the U.S. Senate quickly approved $10.5 billion in aid for victims September 1, 2005. The U.S. House of Representatives voted and approved on the measure Friday, September 2, 2005 without any debate. President Bush requested an additional $51.8 billion on September 7. Congress approved that funding package the next day. On September 24, 2005, following the havoc caused by Hurricane Rita, the National Guard named Brig. Gen. Douglas Pritt of the 41st Brigade Combat Team, Oregon Army National Guard, head of Joint Task Force Rita (formally called JTF Ponchartrain).http://www.katu.com/news/story.asp?ID=79878 The fourteen hundred Oregonian soldiers and airmen, including the 1st Battalion of the 186th Infantry which is designated a quick response unit, were joined by engineers and military police from Louisiana, a Stryker Brigade from Pennsylvania, and an engineering battalion from Missouri. It is their mission to provide relief support for all of the areas in Texas and Louisiana effected by the two storms and to remove obstructions that might otherwise hinder help to those effected. Governments of many countries have offered help to the U.S. for disaster relief, including the governments of Canada, France, United Kingdom, Germany and Mexico, with Canada even offering to accept Katrina evacuees. In addition to asking for federal funds, President Bush has enlisted the help of former presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush to raise additional voluntary contributions, much as they did after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Many had been critical of the slow response, with many people (particularly in New Orleans) left without water and food for three to five days after the storm. Among the first to express criticism of the management of the crisis had been The Pentagon, who complained only a day after Katrina hit that bureaucratic red tape from the Bush administration and the FEMA (newly reorganized under the Department of Homeland Security) had caused the delay of a scheduled and authorized military hospital ship from Norfolk, Virginia, among other related and prepared active military crisis response procedures. Timeline On Friday, August 26, the National Hurricane Center predicted for the first time that Katrina would become a Category 4 storm, and thus exceed the design limits of the New Orleans levees. Map of Louisiana parishes eligible for Category B assistance due to September 27 authorization On Saturday, August 27, President Bush declared a state of emergency under the authority of the Stafford Act for the inland parishes of Louisiana. The next day, Sunday, August 28, Katrina became a Category 4 hurricane and eventually evolved into a Category 5 storm the very same day, with winds blowing at about 175 mph (280 km/h). New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin decided not to declare a mandatory evacuation of the city, and instead opened up the Superdome to those who couldn't leave the city.http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/katrina/evacuation.pdf 550 National Guard troops were stationed inside the Superdome to screen evacuees for weapons. At that point, it was known that the strength of the hurricane would almost certainly exceed the levees' design capacity, and therefore the possibility for major flooding was real. If the levees did fail, people throughout the city would find it very difficult to obtain food and water. If authorities had wanted to pre-position food, the Superdome would have been a logical place, as the population knew it was a designated central location. The Louisiana National Guard delivered enough food for 15,000 people for 3 days. President Bush declared an emergency in six counties of Alabama and 11 in Mississippi . Monday, August 29, at 6:10 am local time, Katrina made landfall. The Louisiana National Guard had called almost 3,500 of its members to state active duty as of 7 a.m. Army Lieutenant Colonel Pete Schneider reported a successful evacuation from the city, crediting the Louisiana Guard's partners in neighboring states for carrying out \\"a coordinated effort\\" that incorporated lessons learned from past evacuations. Schneider said during an interview today with Fox News the state stood ready to house evacuees at the Superdome \\"for as long as it takes\\", reporting that although the massive structure's protective lining tore in the hurricane's Category 4 winds, the roof itself appears to be intact. Louisiana has 65 percent of its troops available for state missions; Mississippi, 60 percent; Alabama, 77 percent; and Florida, 74 percent. performed Louisiana relief operations. was positioned near New Orleans prior to Katrina making landfall, and began relief operations on August 30. The next day, Tuesday, August 30, An estimated 7,500 National Guard troops from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi were on duty, supporting civil authorities, distributing generators, providing medical care, and setting up shelters for displaced residents. As of 8 a.m., almost 3,800 Louisiana Army and Air Guard members were on duty to remove debris, provide security and shelter, distribute water, food and ice, and offer medical and law-enforcement support. The Louisiana Guard was coordinating with Florida, Georgia and Texas to secure two UH-60 Black Hawk and five CH-47 Chinook helicopters to support their operations. In Mississippi, more than 1,900 Guard troops were providing similar support, basing their operations at Camp Shelby. In Florida, more than 700 Florida Guard members were on active duty.

The JTF Katrina JFMCC was later shifted to New Orleans upon arrival of USS Iwo Jima and the Deployable Joint Command and Control DJC2 operations center. Iwo Jima also served as the Presidential Support Platform, JTF Katrina Forward, and Joint Rescue Coordination Center while import New Orleans. Rear Admiral Kilkenny and staff later served as JTF Rita JFMCC providing support to Hurricane Rita disaster recovery. * Four MH-53 Sea Stallion and two HH-60 Seahawk helicopters from  were flying medical-evacuation and search-and- rescue missions in Louisiana, and Bataan's hospital was preparing for possible use for medical support. Bataan, based out of Naval Station Ingleside, Texas, is in the waters off the Louisiana coast. * High-Speed Vessel HSV-2 Swift, stationed in Little Creek, Virginia, sailed to the waters off Louisiana to provide support. * The Iwo Jima Amphibious Readiness Group was preparing to sail from Norfolk, Va., loaded with disaster response equipment and was expected to reach the Louisiana coast in five days, officials said. The group consists of USS Iwo Jima, USS Shreveport, USS Tortuga and USNS Arctic. * The hospital ship USNS Comfort was preparing to leave Baltimore to bring medical assistance to the Gulf region and was expected to reach the area in seven days. Superdome supplies, Aug 31 First report of relief supplies delivered to Superdome. The guardsmen remain under their respective governors' control, which enables them to provide law-enforcement support in the affected regions‚Äîsomething the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits active-duty forces from doing within the United States. By Thursday, September 1, The National Guardsmen accompanied by buses (475 in all) and supply trucks arrived at the Superdome. Media reports \\"few buses\\" there. FEMA director Brown said that he had only earlier that day learned that the New Orleans Convention Center had contained thousands of people without food or water for 3‚Äì4 days. He said trucks were on the way and should be there \\"any time\\". Brown did not give ordinary people the permission to drive the buses delivered by the National Guard - which led to the issue of there being no certified bus drivers. At this point major news sources had been reporting on the situation for a few days. By Friday, September 2, seven days after firm predictions of a Category 5 hurricane, a convoy of several dozen trucks and buses rolled into New Orleans carrying food, water, and other supplies. Some of these trucks were PLS manufactured by the Oshkosh Truck Corporation. These transports can carry more than 15 tons of cargo and can travel in of water. For comparison, when the Indian Ocean earthquake of 2004 tsunami struck the politically fractured city of Banda Aceh without warning, Indonesian officials not only knew about the situation on the ground, but delivered 175 tons of food only 2 days after the disaster. This was due to the fact that the transports were of a worldwide effort, whereas the Katrina relief effort was handled by the U.S. government, alone. Military =National Guard Deployment= U.S. Army Infantry patrolling New Orleans in an area previously underwater, September 2005.

The Coast Guard responded by moving as many helicopters as it could to the affected areas, calling in aircraft from as far away as Cape Cod, Massachusetts. 500 Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty, and many of the hundreds of small boats in the fleet were sent to help. Coast Guard helicopters flew around-the-clock rescue missions. The Coast Guard was one of the first federal agencies to begin rescue operations, despite the fact that almost half the local Coast Guard personnel lost their own homes in the hurricane. They rescued or evacuated more than 33,500 people, six times as many as they saved in all of 2004. According to an article in Time, in the famously decimated St. Bernard Parish, east of New Orleans, Sheriff Jack Stephens says the Coast Guard was the only federal agency to provide any significant assistance for a full week after the storm. =Navy= USS Tortuga at dock in New Orleans. The United States Navy also began Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. Several ships were dispatched to the area: * Aircraft carriers  (arrived September 4) * Amphibious assault ships  (arrived August 30)  (arrived September 3) * Amphibious transport docks  (arrived September 3) * Dock landing ships  (arrived September 3)  (arrived September 3) * Fast combat support ships  (arrived August 31) * Hospital ships  (arrived September 8) * Rescue and salvage  (shipped out August 31, arrived September 4) The amphibious assault ships carried CH-53 Sea Stallion and SH-60 Sea Hawk helicopters which were already being used in search and rescue operations. Harry S. Truman was used as the command center for Naval operations in the area. The Navy also arranged to send eight civilian 14-person swift boat rescue teams to the disaster zone using C-5 Galaxy cargo planes. Lt. Gen. Russel L. Honor√© of the Army was appointed to run a temporary special command, known as Joint Task Force (JTF) Katrina, to coordinate all military responses to the effort, which was based at Camp Shelby in Mississippi. FEMA has asked the Pentagon to have the U.S. Northern Command stand ready for assistance. The Canadian Navy deployed a task force comprising three warships--, and --along with the Coast Guard vessel and three Sea King helicopters and one BO-105 helicopter to the area. The Royal Netherlands Navy frigate arrived September 7. The Mexican Navy sent the warship Papaloapan. It arrived on September 8 to the Mississippi shores with 250 metric tons of food, medicines and supplies. It carried two MI-17 helicopters, an ambulance, seven amphibious vehicles and eight 6-track all-terrain vehicles. =Air Force= U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft unload several tons of supplies at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi. The United States Air Force responded by sending search and rescue, aeromedical evacuation, relief supplies as well as medical care to the affected areas. Keesler AFB was evacuated prior to impact, however out of the students training on the base around 400 volunteered to stay back and clean up the base. Thanks to their efforts the base was operational 6 months earlier than expected. The Air Force has rescued over 4,000 people to date. The Air Force has also evacuated more than 25,000 people in need of medical care from Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. The Air Force's Medical Rapid Response Force is also operating a 25-bed hospital at the airport. Nine million packaged meals have been airlifted into the region. The Air National Guard was also a major presence at The SuperDome (which evacuated more than 25,000 survivors from the area). The 136th Security Forces Squadron, answered the call, flying into the local Naval Air Station, from Ft. Worth (Carswell JRB) Texas, via C-130 Troop Transport. This unit was already in position, within 48 hours after being placed on alert. Government non-military =Federal= Some disaster recovery response to Katrina began before the storm, with Federal Emergency Management Agency preparations that ranged from logistical supply deployments to a mortuary team with refrigerated trucks. However, the federal government's overall lack of response has been widely criticized since the events occurred. President George W. Bush asked Secretary Michael Chertoff of the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate the Federal response. Chertoff designated Michael Brown, head of the FEMA as the Principal Federal Official to lead the deployment and coordination of all federal response resources and forces in the Gulf Coast region. A FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Task Force in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. FEMA deployed all 28 of its Urban Search & Rescue Task Forces with 11 going to Mississippi and 7 to Louisiana. The remaining 10 US&R; Task Forces were deployed to Texas staging areas. FEMA also deployed 29 Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMAT); 5 Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Teams (DMORT); 2 Veterinary Medical Assistance Teams (VMAT); and 1 Mental Health Team to Louisiana and 10 DMATs, 5 DMORTS, 2 VMATS, and 1 Mental Health Team to Mississippi. FEMA also partnered with the Department of Transportation to send 1700 trucks of water, ice, and ready-to-eat meals. The Department of Transportation sent 390 trucks carrying water, tarpaulins, mobile homes and forklifts. The United States Public Health Service was activated and sent dozens of officers to supervise medical response. Though the hurricane closed several airports for some time to come, the Federal Aviation Administration rushed to reopen one runway at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport so that relief flights could begin. A summary of other Federal responses *Department of Homeland Security  The Jones Act was temporarily waived allowing foreign flagged vessels to transport cargo from one U.S. Port to another U.S. Port. United States Coast Guard personnel and assets from all over the country were deployed in the area including 29 Coast Guard cutters and 52 aircraft. The Coast Guard recalled 550 reservists to active duty and had the authorization to recall up to 800 reservists. *The Department of Education coordinated the enrollment of displaced students in school districts across the country. *The Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a special 90-day moratorium on all foreclosures of FHA-insured properties in the Presidentially declared disaster areas. *The Environmental Protection Agency temporarily allowed the supply gasoline and diesel fuels that do not meet standards for emissions through September 15, 2005. The EPA also collected and analyzed flood water samples for biological and chemical contaminants. *The Department of Energy loaned oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve under short-term contractual agreements, to be returned to the reserve once supply conditions return to normal. *The Department of Labor announced a National Emergency Grant to establish approximately 10,000 temporary jobs for eligible dislocated workers to help in the recovery and clean-up efforts underway in Mississippi. *The United States Peace Corps sent some 272 returned Peace Corps volunteers to the Katrina zone to serve as Crisis Corps volunteers and assist FEMA in relief and reconstruction efforts. It was the first and only time Peace Corps volunteers have been deployed within the U.S. *Congress passed the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act (KETRA) of 2005 (H.R. 3768) which temporarily extended all deadlines related to tax returns, payments or other time-sensitive activities for those in the affected area until February 2006. President George W. Bush discussing the Hurricane Katrina relief on September 8, 2005. On Friday, September 2, 2005, Reuters published an article stating that five Silver Fox UAVs (the same UAVs being used in Iraq and Afghanistan for intelligence gathering) equipped with thermal imaging technology are going to be used in the search and rescue missions in New Orleans. Pennsylvanian Republican Representative Curt Weldon stated that he was able to bypass government bureaucracy and obtain the UAVs from an unnamed private company. Weldon stated that the UAVs were being shipped to Baton Rouge and requested deployment of U.S. military personnel who are capable of operating the UAVs and that they could be in operation within hours of arrival.https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20050902/tc_nm/weather_katrina_drones_dc&printer;=1 The Department of Homeland Security issued these key statistics as of 10 a.m. on September 3, 2005: * Lives saved ‚Äî 11,500 * Citizens evacuated ‚Äî 25,000 * Water distributed by FEMA ‚Äî 6.7 million liters * MREs distributed by FEMA ‚Äî 1.9 million * U.S. Coast Guard responders ‚Äî 4,000 * National Guard responders ‚Äî 22,000 * FEMA responders ‚Äî 5,000 Several Carnival Cruise ships were chartered by the American government to provide housing for those who required it. The Salt Lake Tribune reported on September 4, 2005 that the authorities had requested that aid workers not disclose the final destination of those making the transit because a few had caused a ruckus upon finding that they were heading to a location that they held in disfavor. =State and local= Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco's New Orleans Hurricane Relief Foundation was created on August 30, 2005.ref Local governments across the U.S. sent aid in the form of ambulances, search teams and disaster supplies. Shelters to house those displaced were established as far away as Utah. The Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism contacted travelers having reservations at state parks to see if the travelers would voluntarily give up their reservations to persons fleeing Katrina, primarily in the southern part of the state where refugees had already taken shelter (at Lake Chicot State Park, just across the Louisiana state line, a 26-member family from New Orleans, including a grandmother on oxygen, occupied seven of the park's cabins). In any event, refugees at state parks would not be evicted for prior reservations, and those with reservations but no room would either get space at another state park or a gift certificate. Arkansas Visitors Information Centers in Texarkana, El Dorado, Helena, and Lake Village directed refugees to shelters and hotels/motels with available space. Governor Mike Huckabee issued a proclamation releasing $75,000 of state funds to assist shelters in 14 southern and delta counties in Arkansas. At least 850 guardsmen of the Arkansas National Guard have been activated and sent to Louisiana and Mississippi. Governor Huckabee also announced that the state Departments of Health and Human Services and Emergency Management as well as the Arkansas Pharmacists Association would provide free emergency prescriptions and access to dialysis machines. Schools and colleges across the country enrolled students displaced by the storm despite uncertainty over where funding would come from. U.S. Education Secretary Margaret Spellings said on September 12 that 372,000 elementary and high school students had been displaced. Over 715 schools were closed with at least 36 heavy damaged or completely destroyed. About 100,000 college students were also displaced and at least 15 colleges were still closed at that time. Primary and secondary schools are required to educate any \\"homeless\\" students in their district and 25 states reported having taken in Katrina victims. FEMA declared that opening temporary schools and hiring mental health counselors would be reimbursable but the hiring of extra teachers and buying of books would not be. 1000 firefighters volunteered to be sent to the affected region, with their home towns picking up the tab to provide cover in their absence. FEMA had them handing out leaflets, while on September 5 the first assignment for a 50-strong team from Atlanta was \\"to stand beside President Bush as he tours devastated areas.\\" =AmeriCorps= AmeriCorps sent several crews to Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana in response to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. The crews originated from two main organizations, the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) and the Washington Conservation Corps (WCC), as well as from smaller Americorps organizations such as Americorps St. Louis' Emergency Response Team (ERT). The crews performed a number of relief tasks for hurricane survivors, including support on the FEMA/Carnival Cruise Lines shelter ship, tarping damaged roofs, and debris removal. As of the beginning of 2006, AmeriCorps teams have been involved in the rebuilding efforts in Louisiana and Mississippi. As of May 2006, AmeriCorps reported that it would continue to send relief to affected areas. Non-governmental organizations Many local charities are pitching in to help send supplies to victims of hurricane Katrina. =American Red Cross= American Red Cross personnel attending refugees in the Reliant Astrodome. The American Red Cross mobilized the largest relief effort in its 124-year history to aid the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Local Chapters across the nation mobilised tens of thousands of volunteers for immediate deployment to the disaster region. In the first two weeks after the storm, the Red Cross had brought 74,000 volunteers who provided shelter to 160,000 evacuees and more than 7.5 million hot meals. More than 250 Emergency Response Vehicles (ERVs) were sent to provide food and water to victims. By September 11, 75,000 evacuees remained in 445 shelters in 19 states. By that date, the Red Cross was calling for 40,000 new volunteers to relieve those who initially responded. Disaster response classes were training tens of thousands across the country. The American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund collected donations from the public for the relief effort. By September 28, they had raised about one billion dollars in cash and pledges, surpassing the rate of donation for the Asian tsunami and September 11 attacks. This is ten times more money than the next largest amount collected by a charity, the Salvation Army. The Red Cross estimated that its response would cost some $2 billion of which $100 million was expected to be reimbursed by FEMA, while the rest would need to come from donations. Yahoo!, Google and later Amazon.com set up donation pages for the Red Cross. As the Red Cross had raised the vast majority of donations and its response is limited to disaster aid and not to recovery, some charities suggested that the Red Cross share money with groups engaged in rebuilding efforts. The American Red Cross has not been allowed by Louisiana to provide aid within the city of New Orleans. =Amateur radio operators= The president of the American Radio Relay League, Jim Haynie, sent a message to all amateur radio operators noting that the situation in New Orleans and other affected areas is \\"simply too dangerous and no one is being allowed in\\".http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2005/09/01/2/?nc=1 Many media outlets say communications infrastructure is overloaded and destroyed in many places in the disaster area. During the storm, amateur operators gave weather reports to the National Hurricane Center in Florida using HF radio. Operators are also handling health and welfare messages for organizations such as the Salvation Army and Red Cross. Many amateur radio organizations are staging outside the affected area getting ready to deploy into the city and suburbs. On September 1, the American Red Cross asked the ARRL to help provide radio and amateur support for its 35 kitchens and 250 shelters. By September 3, the ARRL had set up amateur radio operations at the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Headquarters in Montgomery Alabama. =America's Second Harvest= America's Second Harvest (now known as Feeding America) responded to the efforts by collecting over 33 million pounds of food specifically for Katrina relief. Since the food bank in New Orleans was non-operational for a short period of time after the hurricane hit, a temporary warehouse was set up in Baker, Louisiana. This operation distributed food to people who were in need before the hurricane as well as people now displaced but Katrina's wreckage. Second Harvesters Food Bank of Greater New Orleans which is a part of America's Second Harvest was operation within a few days and coordinating efforts with the staff in Baker, LA. =Camp Hope= Camp Hope is a volunteer camp located in Violet, LA, which has housed volunteers in the Hurricane Katrina recovery effort of St. Bernard Parish since June 1, 2006. The economic recovery of the Parish is dependent on the removal of debris to facilitate the return of both residents and businesses. The mission of Camp Hope is to house and facilitate volunteer relief efforts in St Bernard Parish and around the New Orlean's area. Those efforts include managing and participating in the removal of health and safety hazards from properties throughout St Bernard parish with the assistance of the local, state, federal, volunteer and non-governmental agencies. As of August 16, 2006, volunteers in St. Bernard had completed 1,668 homes in the Parish. =Family information websites= Several websites were set up to help family members find out information about each other in the chaos. Some include the Red Cross, The Weather Channel, local newspapers, Craigslist, and others. Yahoo set up 100 Internet-linked computers at the Astrodome and developed a meta-search of evacuee registration websites. On September 11, despite having reunited several families, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children had a list of 1,600 children listed as missing by their parents, or who were seeking their families. Problems were that many survivors had no internet access, let alone electrical power, let alone computers or even computer literacy. There were also many sites so a searcher would have to go through several and sort through the many different search protocols and syntax. Another problem in theory is fraud, and another problem is that many sites only included last and first names which in a mass of several hundred thousand displaced persons obviously included many duplicates. = Other organizations = Many charities immediately began fund- raising efforts on behalf of Katrina victims and survivors. An evacuee is given food by a Salvation Army volunteer The Salvation Army responded to the immediate needs of the survivors. Eventually 5.6 million meals were served, 3.3 million people were assisted, and nearly $400 million donated. The Army's immediate response to Hurricane Katrina included the mobilization of more than 178 canteen feeding units and 11 field kitchens which together have served more than 5.7 million hot meals, 8.3 million sandwiches, snacks & drinks. Its SATERN (Salvation Army Team Emergency Radio Network) network of amateur ham- radio operators picked up where modern communications left off to help locate more than 25,000 survivors. And, The Salvation Army pastoral care counselors were on hand to comfort the emotional and spiritual needs of 277,000 individuals. The New York Regional Association of Grantmakers (now Philanthropy New York) published a Donors' Guide for individuals and organizations looking for philanthropic options for Gulf Coast recovery In addition to the Red Cross, numerous charity and relief organizations stepped up their activities to aid hurricane victims. The United Methodist Church provided volunteers to help muck out homes and rebuild affected areas. According to the church's volunteer service arm, UMVIM, over thirty thousand United Methodist volunteers have worked in the affected areas since Katrina. Southern Baptist Disaster Relief mobilized hundreds of units from across the US. Southern Baptist Disaster relief manned massive feeding units, shower and laundry facilities, assessment teams, Mud-Out, and chainsaw and debris removal teams across the affected area. The Catholic Charities activated a disaster response plan. The plan targeted areas outside of the disaster that are providing refugee relief and agencies located in or nearby are mobilizing to assist the needy. Operation Blessing began organizing to ship food and relief supplies into the affected areas, as it has done in disaster zones around the world before. America's Second Harvest, a food bank that operates in many communities, began coordinating efforts to ship food donations to coastal areas. Habitat for Humanity announced plans to check on all Habitat-built homes and their residents, and then turn to providing assistance to Habitat families, partners, and volunteers in need of help. The American Public School Endowments began collecting funds to rebuild schools in the affected area, and to aid schools suffering from an onslaught of refugees. Mercy Corps is accepting donations and sending a team of emergency relief experts to the Gulf region to offer financial and technical assistance for immediate and longer- term relief and recovery efforts. Conservative Mennonites sent many volunteer laborers to help with cleaning and rebuilding of homes affected. Other nonprofit non-governmental organizations that are helping like the ASPCA are listed on Network for Good's website. Jehovah's Witnesses are responding by giving much food, water, clothing, and financial aid to victims. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is also responding to the devastation. While emergency services and rescue personnel work on relief operations in New Orleans, they are at high risk of disease. The Family International has mobilized Christian Counsellors to provide spiritual healing, comfort and encouragement to the evacuees throughout Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi and have launched Katrina Relief Home to share the needs of the victims of this disaster. The KatrinaHelp wiki is a grassroots effort collating all refugee records from a variety of sites (including Craigslist, et al.) in PFIF format; they offer an elegant search interface to their database. The first Pfif spinoff is SFIF (Shelter Finder Interface format), a clone of Pfif where elements and attributes have been adapted to model shelter entities developed by Shelterfinder an interactive database where a list of active shelters is maintained by volunteers Awake In America, a non-profit organization based in Philadelphia, launched \\"Operation Restore CPAP\\" to get equipment to treat sleep apnea in victims of Hurricane Katrina who had been previously diagnosed with sleep apnea. Hands On USA, now Hands On Gulf Coast, was on the ground in Gulfport and Biloxi a week after the storm. Founded in Thailand after the 2004 Tsunami, Hands On has evolved from immediate relief services, to recovery operations such as gutting houses and taking trees off houses, to community empowerment and redevelopment. They are based out of the Beauvoir Methodist Church in Biloxi, MS, although they also have satellite locations in New Orleans and Bay St. Louis. The Common Ground Collective is a local, community- run organization offering assistance, mutual aid and support to New Orleans communities that have been historically neglected and underserved. Common Ground's efforts include acting as a hub for medical and health providers, aid workers, community organizers, legal representatives as well as people with a variety of skills. The Common Ground collective also has been part of organizing the \\"Road Trip for Relief\\", a grassroots effort to bus 300 volunteers into New Orleans. Emergency Communities is a non-profit organization that employs compassion and creativity to provide community-based disaster relief. Since Katrina, they have operated four relief sites, served over 300,000 meals and 25,000 residents of the Gulf. They are a United Way Partner Agency and currently run operations in Buras, LA and the Ninth Ward. The Welcome Home Kitchen is serving three meals a day to over 700 people, as well as providing free medical care, a distribution center of clothing and supplies, a community bulletin board and an information table. The Welcome Home Kitchen is facilitated by The Rainbow Family of Living Light as well as Katrina Alliance. World Shelters Task Force One operated in Hancock County, MS from September 15, 2005 until October 26, 2005 and deployed 80 shelter structures for relief efforts and housing. Remaining supplies and equipment went on to be used by Burners Without Borders, with support from The Buckminster Fuller Institute. Camp Restore began on September 10, 2006 and has since provided shelter to over 3,500 volunteers as they rebuilt hundreds of homes that had been destroyed by the hurricane. The operation is based in East New Orleans and was started in part by the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod.Ross, Paula. LCMS volunteer camp opens in New Orleans 02/04/2010 The Chabad Lubavitch movement sent in rescue teams to evacuate people from the city and provided meals and shelter to evacuees. Chabad communities in Florida, California, Tennessee, Texas, and many other states made short and long term arrangements for many Jewish New Orleanians. Families were also provided with financial help and volunteers were arranged to help with the clean-up efforts http://www.chabadneworleans.com/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/418019/jewish/Relief.htm The Unitarian Universalist church organized a Gulf Coast Relief Fund which aided survivors in Plaquemines Parish. = In Film = * Waveland MissaHippie- 2005 FluxRostrum on Thu, November 24, 2005 Fluxview USA: Waveland MissaHippie ~ Rainbow Family & Christians Unite to Give Hope After Katrina * Common Ground Collective: Solidarity Not Charity- 2005 FluxRostrum on Thu, January 12, 2005 Fluxview USA: Common Ground Collective: Solidarity Not Charity International response Crew members of a German Air Force A-310 aircraft offload Meals Ready-to-Eat (MRE) on board Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, in support of Hurricane Katrina relief efforts Initially, the United States had been reluctant to accept donations and aid from foreign countries. However, this policy was reversed, and as the reports of damage grew more grim, the United States accepted the foreign aid. Countries and organizations that offered to send aid mentioned by the State Department included Afghanistan, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, the Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, the European Union, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, International Energy Agency, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, NATO, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Organization of American States, Oman, OPEC, Pakistan, Paraguay, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, UAE, United Kingdom, the United Nations, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Venezuela and the World Health Organization. Other countries not on this list have also offered aid, but the State Department mentioned that they had not been asked. Later, the U.S. State Department said all offers were being examined. Donations include Kuwait donating 500 million dollars, Canada sending frigate and frigate , a coast guard light icebreaker (), and two Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King helicopters to the area (2 additional helicopters were sent to Boston to replace US Coast Guard helicopters going to Louisiana) and Singapore sending three CH-47 Chinook helicopters and thirty-eight RSAF personnel from a training detachment based in Grand Prairie, Texas. Some of these countries that helped even offered evacuees to immigrate to their respective countries. Notable offers from international organizations include the United Nations, which was ready to send supply high-energy biscuits, generators, planes, tents along with experienced staff members; and Paris- based International Energy Agency agreeing to make 60 million barrels oil available to help the United States weather the economic problems caused by Hurricane Katrina. Cultural and sporting responses The National Hockey League, along with the National Hockey League Players Association, have donated $1 million. An auction of game worn jerseys, from the 2005‚Äì06 NHL season opening night, will also be held.http://www.nhl.com/news/2005/09/234098.html The National Football League donated $1 million, as did the New York Yankees baseball organization. The New York Jets and New York Giants also allowed the 2005 LSU Tigers football team play their home games at Giants Stadium while both the Mercedes-Benz Superdome and the Pete Maravich Assembly Center were being used as a refuge for victims of the hurricane, and Tiger Stadium (LSU) was being used by the New Orleans Saints for their home games. A Concert for Hurricane Relief, an hour-long, music and celebrity driven broadcast was aired on September 2, 2005 by NBC. Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast, an hour long simulcast benefit concert aired on September 9, 2005 worldwide. A four and a half-hour long benefit concert titled ReAct Now: Music & Relief was broadcast by MTV, VH1 and CMT on September 10, 2005. C√©line Dion, the Canadian singer, also donated $1 million. Scam artist responses In the wake of a large outpouring of support, many scam artists took advantage of the public's willingness to provide money and other resources to victims of the hurricane. The FBI reported that over 500 illegitimate websites were created to collect money that ostensibly would go to hurricane victims. Spam emails were then circulated to attract donations.

Omaha World Herald. Berkshire Hathaway. Retrieved 29 November 2016. In addition, he is the first UNO faculty to ever obtain enough private funding to construct an entirely new building for his discipline and one of the few in the world. He was able to transform his 900 square foot laboratory into a 23,000 square foot building by securing a $6 million private donation. The Biomechanics Research Building opened in 2013 and Stergiou moved his research team of 25 scientists into this state-of-the- art unique research environment. However, subsequent growth resulted in the Biomechanics Research Building currently housing over 70 faculty, staff and students, as well as being the home of the UNO Department of Biomechanics which is the first research focused department of this university. Therefore, Stergiou raised another $12 million to expand the building by 30,000 square feet. The UNO's Biomechanics Research Building, is the only research building on the UNO campus, and one of the world's first buildings dedicated to biomechanics research. Stergiou has mentored hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students, doctoral candidates, and post-doctoral fellows in fields related to biomechanics and human movement variability. He is the only UNO faculty member that had four post-doctoral researchers every year for more than five years.

It is the sequel to the 1987 film Three Men and a Baby. Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg, and Ted Danson reprise the leading roles. Plot The three men - Peter, Michael, and Jack - are living happily together with Mary, who is now five, and her mother, Sylvia. Peter and Michael continue their careers as an architect and cartoonist, while Jack has very few acting roles. Sylvia has become a famous actress and is dating her director Edward who wishes to marry her, but Sylvia is unsure how it will affect Mary. Sylvia and Peter are clearly in love with each other, although Peter has difficulty admitting his true feelings. When visiting, Sylvia's mother advises her daughter that Peter may never be able to properly express or admit his true feelings. Sylvia, realizing she wants to get married and start a real family, accepts Edward's marriage proposal and announces to the group that she and Mary will be moving to the United Kingdom after the wedding. The group invites Edward to a get together at the apartment. Peter tells Edward that he has no experience with children and believes he won't be a good father for Mary. When Edward leaves, Sylvia confronts Peter about his behavior, leading to a falling out when Sylvia tells Peter he is selfish and Peter reminds Sylvia about abandoning Mary during the events of the first film. Sylvia and Mary leave the next day for the UK. This depresses Peter, Michael and Jack, who attempt to cheer themselves by renewing their bachelor lifestyle and throwing a party, but still find themselves miserable without Mary or Sylvia. The gang decides to go to the UK to visit Mary, who is miserable and lonely without them. Peter and Michael (Jack plans to fly over later) are reunited with Mary and Sylvia at the rehearsal dinner. Peter is introduced to Miss Elspeth Lomax, headmistress of Pileforth Academy for Girls, who takes a liking to Peter. Edward leads her to believe that Peter has feelings for her, but has difficulty admitting them. Peter and Sylvia reconcile, apologizing for their previous behavior. With the wedding fast approaching, Peter is troubled to hear Mary reveal that Edward dislikes her. Peter and Michael realize that Edward intends to pack Mary off to the Pileforth boarding school, but Edward denies everything and Sylvia refuses to believe Peter, knowing he has disliked Edward from the beginning. In the middle of the argument, Jack arrives and Sylvia and Edward leave. Jack confronts Peter about his true feelings for Sylvia, and Peter finally admits he always expected Jack and Sylvia would reconcile and he ultimately would have caused everyone to get hurt. Jack assures Peter that Sylvia loves only him and he must be true to his feelings. The night before the wedding, Peter goes to Pileforth in a successful attempt to get proof of Edward's scheme, but Elspeth believes that Peter is finally admitting his \\"feelings\\" for her and she reciprocates. After initial surprise and then unsuccessfully attempting to deflect her advances, Peter manages to get away. When his car breaks down, he calls Jack and Michael, confirming he has the proof, but he will be delayed. Michael, Jack and Mary conspire to stall the wedding. Michael kidnaps the vicar and Jack disguises himself as an elderly replacement. Peter, with help from Elspeth, heads to the wedding and during the ride, she confesses that Edward informed her of Peter's affections. Peter reveals that Edward made it all up, but apologizes for the misunderstanding. Peter and Elspeth arrive at the church after numerous delays. He confronts Sylvia with the truth, Elspeth herself confirming that Edward has been lying and his trying to defend himself prompts Mary to accuse him of lying again. Edward reveals his true colors when he then swears at Mary and Peter in turn knocks him out by punching him. Sylvia declares her intention to go home, but Peter stops her and declares his love for her, whereupon Edward re-emerges and states it is too late as they are already married. Jack then reveals himself - not only has he finally proven his acting skills, but the marriage is null and void. Peter and Sylvia wed with Mary as their bridesmaid, who afterwards throws the bouquet into the air and it is caught by an obviously shocked Jack.

Particular use is made of Broughton Castle. The scenes where the car breaks down and Peter makes a call from a phone box are shot at Burton Dassett Country Park, in south Warwickshire. The school which Mary was to attend (Pileforth Academy) was shot at two locations. The external shot of the school is the Jesuit boarding school Stonyhurst College in the Ribble Valley, Lancashire. The internal scenes of the school were shot at the (former) Benedictine boarding school Douai School near Thatcham, West Berkshire. Reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 38% based on 16 reviews. Critics Rita Kempley and Desson Howe of the Washington Post wrote positively of the film, citing the three main characters' comical rap, the race for Peter to stop the wedding, and the relationship between him and Miss Lomax as the film's most enjoyable scenes. However, Howe also criticized it, claiming Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg were overshadowed for the remainder of the film. Soundtrack One of the most widely recognized tracks from the film is \\"Waiting for a Star to Fall\\" by Boy Meets Girl, which featured during the final wedding scene and end credits. The film's soundtrack album contains the three leads' singing \\"Goodnite, Sweetheart, Goodnite\\" from Three Men and a Baby,https://www.soundtrack.net/album/three-men-and-a-little-lady/ which had no soundtrack album of its own.

The group, led by Shaykh Abdur Rahman and Siddiqur Rahman (also known as Bangla Bhai), is alleged to be affiliated with Al Qaeda, although this has not been proven. Another Islamic terrorist group, named Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, was associated with JMB in executing the co-ordinated attack. Following the bombings, both groups were banned by the Government of Bangladesh. Attacks The bomb exploded near Government facilities. In Dhaka, they exploded near Bangladesh Secretariat, the Supreme Court Complex, the Prime Minister's Office, the Dhaka University campus, the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel and Zia International Airport.

They are not to be confused with the two superheroines Thunder and Lightning, sisters introduced at different times who are the daughters of Black Lightning. Publication history Thunder and Lightning first appeared in New Teen Titans #32 and was created by Marv Wolfman and George P√©rez. Fictional character biography Gan and Tavis Williams are twin brothers that were born of an unnamed Vietnamese woman and an American soldier named Second Lt. Walter Williams. Originally conjoined twins, they were separated with magic. As children, they found themselves beginning to manifest superpowers, but they had little control over these powers, and without an infusion of their father's blood, they would quickly burn themselves out. So, they took the aliases Thunder and Lightning, respectively, and set off to America to search for their father. They caused major disturbances in St. Louis and engaged in battle against the Teen Titans. However, after their aims were revealed, the Titans decided to help the pair.New Teen Titans #32 (June 1983) Months later, the Teen Titans and S.T.A.R. Labs were working on a cure for Thunder and Lightning's powers. At the same time, Raven, using her powers, discovered that their father was actually an alien who had crash landed in Cambodia six hundred years ago, and was currently being held prisoner by the H.I.V.E. as they tried to exploit knowledge from him. When they located him, H.I.V.E. controlled the alien in a fight against Thunder and Lightning and the Teen Titans. In the end, Thunder and Lightning were forced to kill their own father to protect their new friends. A blood transfusion from their father allowed S.T.A.R. Labs to create the cure that would allow Thunder and Lightning to control their powers.New Teen Titans #36 (November 1983) Thunder and Lightning resettled in San Francisco, where S.T.A.R Labs helped them control their powers. While there, they helped stop the Atomic Skull.Teen Titans Spotlight #16 (November 1987) They worked as security guards for S.T.A.R. until Trigon briefly took control of them. They were captured and held in stasis at S.T.A.R. Labs until they could be free from the demon seeds.New Titans #118-121 (February-May 1995) At some point they were freed of the seeds, as the two of them later returned to help the Titans battle the Justice League, via transport arranged from the ultra-powerful Cyborg. Thunder and Lightning came in too late to actually fight any of the Justice League but they still assisted in neutralizing the threat posed by Cyborg. After that, they returned to Southern Vietnam to defend it from an unknown alien threat.JLA/Titans: The Technis Imperative #2-3 (January-February 1999) During the \\"Infinite Crisis\\" storyline, they were subdued by the League of Assassins in Vietnam who were being paid to break open a prison as part of a worldwide scheme to attack Metropolis with dozens of supervillains.Villains United special (June 2006) During the Salvation Run storyline, Thunder and Lightning arrive to give food to Martian Manhunter. Martian Manhunter asks why they are here on this planet. When they offered to help Martian Manhunter, Bane attacks them. Despite being shocked by Lightning, Bane defeats the both of them as Lex Luthor arrives.Salvation Run #6 (June 2008) Luthor keeps the two alive, later using them as power sources for his teleporter. The two are seemingly killed when the teleporter device self- destructs.Salvation Run #7 (July 2008) In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Thunder and Lightning are reintroduced as part of The Ravagers, a superhero team which also includes Beast Boy, Terra, Ridge, and Fairchild.The Ravagers #1 Powers and abilities Thunder is able to control thunder as he manifests as rumbling noises which he can control to varying degrees. Lightning is able to release bolts of electricity and harness lightning. The two have a psychic link that allows them to communicate with each other. Other versions =Superman villains= The original Thunder and Lightning battle Superman. From Superman #303. An unrelated Thunder and Lightning appeared as Superman villains in Superman #303 (September 1976). These were actually two entities in the body of a sentient android used by a super-villain called Whirlicane (who had previously fought Superman in Action Comics #457), who wanted to conduct a series of terror acts across the US. Not knowing about his android origin, Thunder/Lightning hoped for his release by Whirlicane when his tasks were finally fulfilled, but then Superman exposed the truth. Going mad over the realization, Thunder/Lightning released a massive lightning burst, destroying himself, Whirlicane and his base; Superman escaped unscathed.Superman #303 In other media =Television= * Thunder and Lightning first appeared in the Teen Titans episode \\"Forces of Nature\\" with Thunder voiced by S. Scott Bullock and Lightning voiced by Quinton Flynn. They are seemingly supernatural brothers who just want to have fun, but they make life miserable for everyone else with their disregard for the safety of others. Their powers are thunderous sound blasts and lightning bolts respectively, as well as the shared power of flight (Thunder conjures a flying cloud, and Lightning transmutes his lower body into electricity). When they combine their powers, they can cause rain, and this is possibly how they are able to teleport, manifesting in massive blasts of lightning. Their appearances seem to be influenced by the eponymous characters from the 1998 game Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't so Frightening. Thunder is rather large, has a deep voice, and wears blue samurai armor. Lightning is skinny, tall, speaks in a high, fast voice, wears a yellow-orange suit of samurai armor without a helmet, and wears his hair in a style reminiscent of a lightning bolt. Thunder seemed to be the nicer and more reasonable of the duo, having doubts all along the ordeal. Lightning was rebellious and unrepentant, only deciding to help out once Thunder pointed out the error of their ways. Slade (disguised as the \\"Old One\\") manipulated Thunder and Lightning into setting fire to some posts with magical emblems on them, which created a giant Fire Monster bent on destroying the city. It was stopped when Thunder and Lightning joined their powers to make it rain, therefore putting out the Fire Monster before it can reach the city. The two of them are also watched by the Brotherhood of Evil in \\"Homecoming: Part 2\\", although they were not given their own communicator in \\"Forces of Nature\\" (chances are they received communicators from the Teen Titans during one of the unaired missions). They both later appear as Thunder attempts to fight off the I.N.S.T.I.G.A.T.O.R. and Steamroller, while Lightning takes on Overload, all sent by the Brotherhood of Evil. They are overpowered and flash-frozen by Professor Chang. However, M√°s y Menos free them, and they join in the final battle in the Brotherhood headquarters. Thunder is seen attacking a group of villains with a giant thunder explosion. They later appear with the other Titans to confront Dr. Light. =Miscellaneous= * Thunder and Lightning appear in Teen Titans Go! #6.

It was the television successor to Crawfords' radio series D24. The \\"Consummate Homicide cast\\" includes the four characters that are the best known: Det. Snr. Sgt. David \\"Mac\\" MacKay (Leonard Teale), Det. Sgt. Peter Barnes (George Mallaby), Inspector Colin Fox (Alwyn Kurts) and Sen. Det. Jim Patterson (Norman Yemm). Synopsis The series dealt with the homicide squad of the Victorian Police force and the various crimes and cases the detectives are called upon to investigate. Many episodes were based directly on real cases, although the characters (including the detectives) were fictional. 510 episodes were produced and aired from 20 October 1964 to January 1977 (12 years and 6 months), making it the longest-running Australian weekly primetime drama in history. With 510 episodes produced (the last episode is numbered 509, due to the pilot episode being numbered with an 'A' suffix, making a total of 510), for many years it held the record for most episodes produced in an Australian weekly primetime drama. When Blue Heelers ended in 2006, the show equalled this record. However, Homicide ran on-air for longer than Blue Heelers, and had a greater cumulative running time due to five feature-length episodes.Classic Australian Television Homicide Episode Details Cast and characters *Insp.

Rex Fraser (Lex Mitchell) ‚Äì 1964‚Äì1965, 28 episodes :Young, impulsive, and single, Fraser is a ladies man and a milk drinker (instead of alcohol), and only recently assigned to the squad. Transferred to another squad after being promoted to Senior Detective in episode 27, \\"Fifth Column\\". *Sen. Det. / Det. Sgt. / Det. Snr. Sgt. David 'Mac' Mackay (Leonard Teale) ‚Äì 1965‚Äì1973, 358 episodes :Known as 'Mac', Mackay is a tough cop with high ideals about justice. Initially he has a large chip on his shoulder ‚Äì he had been a Detective Sergeant before, but was demoted to Senior Detective because of a report by Bronson. This initially triggers conflict when Mackay realizes Bronson is to be his superior officer, but he mellows and matures over the years. Promoted to Sergeant after Bronson's death, Mackay is eventually promoted to Inspector and transferred to Ballarat in episode 383, \\"Assassin\\". In the final episode, \\"The Last Task\\", Mackay returns to help out his old squad in a case. The final scene has the cast looking through a doorway into the lens of the camera ‚Äì ostensibly farewelling Mac, but actually saying goodbye to the viewer. (Teale was the programme's longest serving cast member, appearing in 358 of the show's 510 episodes.) *Sen. Det. Bill Hudson (Leslie Dayman) ‚Äì 1966‚Äì1968, 104 episodes :A crack shot who hates the idea of killing anyone ‚Äì but is forced to do so on several occasions in order to protect other people's lives ‚Äì Hudson is a 'new breed' type of detective, well-trained in scientific methods of detection and with a modern approach to everyday living ‚Äì in contrast to Connolly's solid beat- trained old-school type of detective. He is transferred from Forensic to assist Homicide after Mackay is seriously wounded by a prison escapee, and remains with the squad after Sergeant Bronson is killed on the case ‚Äì a death he blames himself for. After being forced to fatally shoot another person once too often, Hudson is granted a leave of absence in episode 161, \\"The Pay Off\\". Dialogue in a later episode indicates that Hudson had been transferred back to Forensic and was due to return to work shortly. *Det. / Sen. Det. / Det. Sgt. Peter Barnes (George Mallaby) ‚Äì 1968‚Äì1973, 265 episodes :Transferred from the Sydney Vice Squad, Barnes is a brash young cop ‚Äì and a bit of a swinging bachelor ‚Äì promoted to Detective at an earlier age than usual. He matures over the years, developing into a talented, formidable detective but retaining his good nature and sense of humour. Promoted to Sergeant after Mackay transfers out, Barnes has a nervous breakdown shortly afterwards from the strain of non- stop murder cases in episode 395, \\"One Too Many\\".As noted above, Barnes was added because the expanding scope of Homicide was proving a strain on the existing actors for location filming; it was decided that adding a permanent fourth detective would help spread the load around the regular cast. *Sen. Det. Alberto \\"Bert\\" Costello (Lionel Long) ‚Äì 1968‚Äì1969, 49 episodes :A first- generation Australian of Italian descent who, like his predecessor Hudson, has been transferred from Forensic. Unlike Hudson, Costello prefers more action. Killed in a mine cave-in during a case in episode 210, \\"A Quiet Town\\". *Insp. Colin Fox (Alwyn Kurts) ‚Äì 1969‚Äì1973, 184 episodes :Originally from Maldara in country Victoria, a widower who lives with his unmarried daughter, Fox is greatly respected by the other detectives who realise his bark is worse than his bite ‚Äì but don't let on. Shrewd with a dry sense of humour, Fox has a deep and mature respect for the role he fills. Shot dead by a sniper in episode 383, \\"Assassin\\". *Sen. Det. Jim Patterson (Norman Yemm) ‚Äì 1969‚Äì1972, 123 episodes :A tough-as-nails cop with a direct methodology and a devoted family man, Patterson had previously boarded with Inspector Fox when posted to Maldara. He has an identical twin brother, Eddie (played by Yemm's real-life twin Gordon), who inadvertently causes havoc in the squad in a case of mistaken identity in episode 249, \\"The Superintendent\\". The episode (an out- and-out comedy) includes a legendary dream sequence in which three of the detectives are racing down an alleyway, guns blazing ‚Äì but trouserless.In all the two-shots Gordon played Jim while Norman played Eddie, and in single shots Norman played both roles; he also dubbed both their voices. In episode 298, \\"Inquest\\", Gordon Yemm doubled for his brother in action sequences after Norman suffered a leg injury. Quits the force after becoming too emotionally involved in a case in which he nearly kills the murderer of a small boy in episode 333, \\"Grains of Sand\\". *Sen. Det. / Det. Sgt. Bob Delaney (Mike Preston) ‚Äì 1972‚Äì1973, 42 episodes :A Londoner who had been a constable in the British police force before coming to Australia, Delaney is a 'snappy' modern dresser who pushes his clothes and hair length to the regulation limit. Replacing Patterson, Delaney is killed by a letter-bomb in episode 375, \\"We'll Both Remember Angie\\"; the episode ends with a police funeral with full honours, specially filmed for the series. *Sen. Det. Phil Redford (Gary Day) ‚Äì 1973‚Äì1977, 134 episodes :A Vietnam veteran who has strong ideas about violence, Redford is also studying law part-time at university. Delaney's replacement, he remains to the end of the series. *Insp. Reg Lawson (Charles Tingwell) ‚Äì 1973‚Äì1977, 126 episodes :Recalled to Melbourne from Scotland Yard (after serving with the United Nations peace-keeping forces in Cyprus) to take over the squad after the murder of Inspector Fox. Remains to the end of the series. *Sen. Det. Pat Kelly (John Stanton) ‚Äì 1973‚Äì1974, 49 episodes :A tough, no-nonsense detective brought in after Barnes is promoted to Sergeant. Crippled in a car crash when pursuing a criminal in episode 432, \\"The Fellas Send Their Regards\\". *Det. Sgt. Harry White (Don Barker) ‚Äì 1973‚Äì1977, 114 episodes :A family man, good-natured joker and incessant talker, but with a tough edge that increasingly comes to the fore. He replaces Barnes after his breakdown, and remains to the end of the series. *Sen. Det. Mike Deegan (Dennis Grosvenor) ‚Äì 1974‚Äì1977, 77 episodes :A motorcycle-riding, martial-arts expert transferred to the Homicide squad from Ballarat, where he had worked under Inspector Mackay, as Kelly's replacement. Remains to the end of the series. Characters' ranks (except for Detective Inspector) changed in accordance with real-life changes in the Victoria Police Force. For example, Detective Sergeant Mackay becomes Detective Senior Sergeant to reflect his role as the squad's number-two when this rank was introduced. Barnes becomes a Senior Detective after the rank of Detective was abolished.  Scripts  Homicide scripts explored a number of major social issues, such as: *pack rape (episode 21, \\"The Violators\\") *prostitution (episode 23, \\"The Brand\\") *loneliness, suicide and mercy killing (episode 31, \\"An Act Of Love\\") *the occult (episode 34, \\"Witch Hunt\\") *police shooting of criminals (episode 76, \\"The Snipers\\") *road safety (episode 123, \\"No Licence To Kill\\") *drugs (episode 128, \\"Freakout\\") *the plight of pensioners (episode 208, \\"Everybody Knows Charlie\\") *pollution (episode 314, \\"Fighting Fred\\") *use of firearms (episode 405, \\"Time And Tide\\") *‚Äòpoofter bashing‚Äô (episode 411, \\"A Crime Against Nature\\") *youth gangs (episode 434, \\"The Graduation Of Tony Walker\\") *child abuse (episode 463, \\"The Life And Times Of Tina Kennedy\\") *the dangers of hitch-hiking (episode 478, \\"Wipe Out\\") Many of these episodes were introduced by Fegan to highlight their significance (and, presumably, to indicate they may not be suitable for younger viewers). Scripts were frequently based on real murder cases, including: *Episode 211, \\"I, Mick O'Byrne\\", based on the recent case of Ronald Ryan, the last man hanged in Australia. *Episode 37, \\"Colour of Hate\\", based on the real-life murder of a young police constable. The victim's family later wrote a very appreciative letter to Crawfords in which they described the episode as ‚Äòa fine tribute to our son‚Äôs courage and devotion to duty‚Äô. The letter was later read out by Teale in the documentary The Homicide Story, who noted that it held a special place in the production team's files. *Episode 39, \\"A Lonely Place\\", based on the case of serial killer Arnold Sodeman, who strangled four girls between 1930‚Äì1935 when affected by alcohol. While Sodeman was hanged after a long legal battle, the episode doesn't indicate what happens to his fictional equivalent. *Episode 180, \\"Dead or Alive\\", based on real-life New Zealand mass killer Stanley Graham, who murdered seven people (four policemen and three civilians) in October 1941. Unlike the real case, where Graham was eventually shot dead by police, the fictional killer is captured alive, and the episode ends with detectives wondering if he will be sentenced to death or found insane.  Broadcast history  The first episode aired at 7:30 p.m Tuesday 20 October 1964. The debut episode (\\"The Stunt\\") was not the first to be produced, with the pilot (\\"One Man Crime Wave\\") airing as episode 24A just prior to the departure of Lex Mitchell. Regular daytime repeat screenings began in the early 1970s running until the early 1980s, as strip programming. Additionally, seven episodes were screened as specials, or part of specials: * ep. 376 ‚Äì \\"Initiation\\", as part of the HSV-7 nostalgia program \\"Those Were The Days\\" * episodes 379 (\\"The Last Way Out\\"), 385 (\\"The Friendly Fellow\\"), 394 (\\"Patterns & Stripes Don't Mix\\"), 410 (\\"Bill\\"), and 463 (\\"The Life & Times Of Tina Kennedy\\") as part of the program's 30th anniversary celebration in 1994 * ep. 383 ‚Äì Assassin, shown in November 2005 as part of HSV-7's 50th year celebrations. In the 1960s, the series was picked up, on a regional basis, by some of the ITV companies in the UK. Not all regions screened the show, which was scheduled in a late-night slot (usually 10:30pm or later), but among those that did were Westward TV, Yorkshire TV, Channel TV, Border TV and Southern Television. In 2004, the episodes \\"Flashpoint\\" (ep. 56) and \\"Stopover\\" (ep. 504) were screened cinematically by Melbourne Cinematheque. In August 2010, WIN Television, as part of their late night \\"Crawford's Classic Drama\\" series, began sequential repeats from episode 1, but ceased in March 2011 at episode 33 (the pilot \\"One Man Crime Wave\\" was not included). Technical specifications Early episodes were in black and white with the bulk of material recorded on videotape in the studios of HSV7 using a multicamera setup. Each episode also featured about ten minutes of location footage shot on 16 mm film. Total time per episode was 47 minutes. 134 of the episodes were filmed in colour. The opening and closing theme music was the library piece \\"Victory\\" written by American composer James Reichert. With occasional exceptions, the filmed segments did not have synchronised sound and so featured little dialogue, concentrating more on dramatic shots of cars pulling in, gun battles, and fist fights. Dialogue for the film scenes was done \\"post sync\\". This means that the dialogue was recorded on location but, due to the often low quality of audio recorded in this manner, the actor was required to record the dialogue in a sound-proof studio in the standard filmmaking process known as Additional Dialogue Recording. Location recordings were used infrequently, and usually limited to brief dialogue snatches in enclosed spaces, such as the interior of a car. Sound effects would be also dubbed onto the location-shot footage. Both pre-recorded sound effects recordings and the work of Crawford's foley artist would be used. Episode 56, \\"Flashpoint\\", which first aired on 19 April 1966, was shot entirely on location on film, and most of the dialogue of this episode was post-synched. Over the years the ratio of film to videotape was increased, and synchronised sound became the norm. When the series switched from black and white to colour in 1973, it necessitated shooting entirely on film, as the HSV7 studios were yet to be converted to colour video production. If a script was amended, a Crawford Productions staff member who lived near the actor concerned would be required to deliver the new script to their house. Quite often this new dialogue had to be memorised for filming the next day.These days it would be sent by fax or email. The workload for the regular actors, especially for location work, was notoriously heavy. In 1967 the regular squad was increased from three to four to better share the load, which remained the standard team to the end. In 1972, when it was decided to transfer production entirely to film, the result was a massive increase in overtime demanded by the series. Teale and Kurts promptly quit, and Mallaby only re-signed with a 13-week \\"escape clause\\", which he eventually invoked. All cited the worsening workload, which was best expressed by Teale as he announced his departure from the show: :\\"There has never been a dispute over basic pay rates; the dispute has always involved the massive overtime that Crawfords want me to work in the new year. In the end it became a simple choice between my marriage and Homicide. I chose my marriage.\\"TV Times, Oct 21, 1972, quoted at http://www.classicaustraliantv.com/homicidepage2.htmAs it turned out his decision was a good one; Teale and his wife remained together until his death some 20 years later. Feature film Late in the show's run ‚Äì between episodes 470 and 480 ‚Äì a feature-length episode was filmed. This film was entitled Stopover, with the title Homicide not used at all, and was shot entirely on film on new sets and on location at Melbourne Airport. Lawson, White, Deegan and Redford are the detectives in the film. The story involved an international rock band that was held at the airport following the fatal overdose of a band member. Guest stars included Jon English as the band's lead singer, and Tony Bonner as the band member who overdosed. The film never received a cinema release but was shown on television as a special in 1976. It is officially listed as episode 504, with episodes 502 and 503 also being feature-length. Awards Homicide won multiple awards for its scripts, including three AWGIEs, two Logies, one Penguin and one Sammy Award: AWGIEs: :1970: John Dingwall ‚Äì Best Script for a TV Drama Series for episode 208, \\"Everyone Knows Charlie\\" :1975: Peter Schreck ‚Äì episode 434, \\"The Graduation Of Tony Walker\\" :1976: Keith Thompson ‚Äì Best Script for Telemovie for episode 504, \\"Stopover\\" Logies: :1973: Fred 'Cul' Cullen ‚Äì Best Script for episode 385, \\"The Friendly Fellow\\" :1974: Fred 'Cul' Cullen ‚Äì Best Script for episode 414, \\"Twelve Bar Blues\\" Penguin: :1975: Australian Film Commission Second Prize for episode 434, \\"The Graduation Of Tony Walker\\" Sammy: :1976: Keith Thompson ‚Äì Best Writer (TV Play) for episode 504, \\"Stopover\\" Significance Homicide was the first major dramatic television series to be produced in Australia, the domestic television market having been previously dominated by American and British imports. In 1964, any Australian-made product tended to be quiz shows, children's series, music/variety series and one-off plays, with local drama production sporadic at best, with only a handful of typically short-lived series on commercial television such as Autumn Affair, Emergency and The Story of Peter Grey, along with several mini-series on ABC such as Stormy Petrel. Foreign imports were preferred because they were both cheaper and (especially for US series) more plentiful than local productions. Homicide proved that there was a market for home-grown dramatic programming and was highly successful from the start ‚Äì its initial ratings were in the 30s, and regularly rated in the high 40s and even low 50s (modern cop show ratings tend to be in the 20s at best). In addition, the series was produced at a tenth of the cost of an overseas program and easily outrated them. In 1971, it was the top rated show in the country. Division 4 was second. The series also proved itself to be a virtual training ground for Australian television and film production. During its 12-year run, almost everyone in the industry ‚Äì actors, directors, scriptwriters, producers, camera crew, etc. ‚Äì worked on the series at some point in their careers, and guest roles were filled by a veritable Who's Who of the Australian entertainment ‚Äì both established and newcomers. For these reasons, as well as for inspiring a series of popular cop dramas that followed, it remains one of the most important programmes in the history of Australian television. In 1994, a special tribute to the series aired titled Homicide: 30 Years On, hosted by Blue Heelers stars John Wood and Lisa McCune, which included interviews with surviving cast members and guest stars (both Fegan and Teale had already died at that time). In 2007, Homicide was chosen for an Australia Post stamp to celebrate 50 years of television in Australia. DVD release Homicide has been released on DVD in a series of box sets since December 2012. Each box set contains 26 episodes on 7 discs. Twenty box sets and a bonus disc of The Homicide Story have been released, representing the complete series run and is available from Crawford's online store. International buyers should use Crawford's UK outlet, Eaton Films (EatonFilms.co.uk).

The final product of the videographer's documentation is commonly called a wedding video. It is also referred to as a wedding movie, or a wedding film. A videographer recording a wedding Wedding videography can trace its roots back to before the invention of the modern video camera through 8mm and 16mm films. When film was the only way to capture moving pictures, a few enterprising individuals would take the family 8mm camera and film the weddings of friends and family. These film cameras had a major limitation in the form of 4-minute load times. After exposing 4 minutes of film, the operator would have to load a new film cartridge. The high cost of processing and the fact the majority of them could not record sound to the film further limited the industry. However, there were still a few individuals who were able to turn the documentation of weddings into a business. In 1967 Sony introduced the first Portapak, the Sony DV-2400 Video Rover. With the introduction of these first camcorders, wedding video documentation evolved from something only for the rich into something for the masses. Early adopters were primarily hobbyists who at first started recording the weddings of friends and family, then went on to do jobs for pay. The early days of professional wedding videography were marked by primitive technology and technique, with the equipment generally producing low image quality. Cameras required bright lights, had fuzzy pictures, poor color saturation, and single-channel, poor quality audio. The cameras were bulky, with a separate unit that connected to the video recorder via a cable, severely limiting the videographer's movement. In post-production, many wedding videos were not edited. Generation loss was also a limiting factor because of the nature of analog video tape. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the state of the industry began to improve. Videographers began to form regional and national organizations, the largest, currently active organization being the Wedding and Event Videographers Association International (WEVA). Manufacturers created a market between the professional video camera and video camera consumer levels, known as the prosumer, which met the needs of this niche market. Towards the mid-1990s, the manufacturers introduced digital cameras, removing the last of the technological barriers that had impeded wedding videography since it was established. The cameras were small, mobile, worked even better than the already good analog cameras on the market in low light situations, and allowed the videographer to be discreet and not an intrusion to the events. A wedding videographer shooting on smaller DSLR equipment. Post-production creativity took a major leap forward with the introduction of advanced tools like the Newtek Video Toaster in the early 1990s. This led to the introduction of other relatively inexpensive non-linear editing systems (NLE), which offered the editor many more creative options. But the delivery method still relied on an analog viewing system, VHS video tape. This changed in the late 1990s with introduction of the recordable DVD. Weddings and events were now recorded digitally, edited digitally, and delivered digitally, greatly improving the image quality. By the late 1990s, wedding videography had expanded beyond documentation of weddings. The majority of wedding videographers preferred to add the additional term of \\"event\\" to their description of service. New offerings, such as Love Stories, Photo Montages (a retrospective collection of photographs set to music), music videos, family biographies, anniversaries, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, graduations, and many other one-time events were also being documented in large numbers on video. The general skill level of the industry's members improved and post-production capabilities reflected the standards of commercial productions. Typical styles Common styles range from \\"journalistic\\" to \\"cinematic\\". ;Video Journalistic style (also referred to as documentary style): Typically described as a documentary film of the event. Segments are edited as they occur to preserve continuity. This style of editing will produce a polished documentation of the day as it unfolds. ;Cinematic: Cinematic videography/editing is defined as a ‚Äòfilmy' look. This style aims to increase the emotional impact through use of slow motion and transition effects, saturated colors, creative camera angles and dramatic music. It has that 'wow' factor to tell your story in a unique way. ;Concept Videos: Concept wedding video is the most artistic and elaborated type of wedding videos. It is usually scripted and includes a lot of preparation, usually a few pre wedding shoots, interviews with the couple or guests and finally the wedding video itself. ;Short Form Wedding:Although there is no official standard, the generally accepted rule of thumb for a short form is between 10-45 minutes in length. The first thing you will probably notice when viewing a film is that events don‚Äôt always occur in chronological order. That‚Äôs not to say, however, that it doesn‚Äôt flow. In fact most times it can have a very concise flow. The reason being is that couples trust the videographers creative instincts, which in turn allows us to tell a more compelling story by shifting around certain moments. This is known as \\"time- shifting.\\" Normally the different elements of the day are connected by speeches, sound bites or vows from the ceremony, together they tell a compete story. ;Instagram Videos: Since the rise in popularity of mobile phones and social media apps, especially Instagrams popularity there has been an increase in much shorter wedding videos. The typical length of an Instagram video is 15 seconds to 60 seconds for the Instagram feed. You can also upload longer videos too to IGTV. ;Drone shots: Drones have become more common at weddings which has seen a surge in Aerial photography and videography. Aerial photo of Lough Erne Resort in Ireland While in some traditions the wedding is the most important event of one's life, in others it is regarded as a mere celebration. The more traditional and orthodox religions regard weddings as a very important tradition and invest large amounts of money in this event, even making loans. Types of video  Wedding video has grown in recent years to encompass countless video production offerings. Some are produced to be shown at the wedding or are delivered after the wedding. ;Engagement/proposal video: A video documenting how one person proposes to his or her partner. An engagement/proposal video is usually filmed without the other person's knowledge in order to capture the other person's genuine reaction & surprise. ;Invitation DVD: Some invitation printers will include a DVD in a slot in the printed invitation. The DVD shows the couple and/or the parents on camera inviting viewers to the wedding and reception. ;Photo montage (also called video scrapbooks): Includes but is not limited to still pictures displayed on a video. Can also include sound bites and video footage, but is predominantly still photos. ;Love story: Traditionally an interview of the soon to be couple about how they met, what they are like together and what their plans for the future are. Quite often the interview is inter-cut with romantic footage of the couple frolicking together or re-enactments of what they are talking about. ;Concept video: Typically a short film that incorporates to tell a story about the bride or groom or both. Quite often not related to the couple's real life. ;Same day edit (also called a wedding day edit, sometimes abbreviated as SDE): A short video (usually 3 to 5 minutes) produced from the footage of the wedding shot earlier in the day, usually incorporating footage from pre-ceremony (getting ready), ceremony, photoshoot, reception entrance and first dance, which is then showed near the end of the reception (usually prior to the bride & groom speeches) as a recap of the wedding. It is also possible to incorporate footage shot prior to the wedding in the same day edit. ;Next day edit (sometimes abbreviated as NDE) : A next day edit is similar in concept as a Same Day Edit, except it is made overnight to be played the next day. A next day edit is a short video (usually 3 to 5 minutes) produced from the footage captured during the day, edited over night, to be played the next day. It is quite common to see Next Day Edit videos in South Asian weddings where there are multiple days of events. A wedding can have the ceremony take place on Saturday and have a Next Day Edit video played during the reception on Sunday evening. ;Bridal elegance: A video shot in the style of a fashion shoot that depicts the bride in her wedding gown. Can be done before, during or after the wedding. ;Highlights: A wedding highlight video is usually a 3 to 12 minutes video/short film that highlights the best moments of the wedding day. A highlight video can be edited in Non-linear or Linear fashion. A linear highlight video is a highlight video that shows the sequence of the day in chronological order. A non-linear highlight video focus on story telling, thus, footage & speeches are sometimes shown out of chronological order to tell an engaging story. Is quite common to share highlight video on YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, Instagram and other social networks to family and friends. The shorter highlight video is quite often popular for showing to friends, while immediate family members and close friends might want watch the full-length wedding video. ;Trash the dress: A fad that struck the video and photography markets from 2005 to 2008. The idea was to create art by soaking, staining, dirtying or outright destroying the wedding gown. The shoot often occurred after the wedding day.: See also * DVD * Event videography * High-definition video * Super 8 mm film * video *Video production * videography * Wedding photography  References  Category:Film and video technology Category:Wedding industry ","title":"Wedding videography"},{"id":"2600637","text":"Pasquotank may refer to: * Pasquotank County, North Carolina * Pasquotank River, in northeastern North Carolina ","title":"Pasquotank"},{"id":"2600638","text":"Unashogi is a variant of shogi (Japanese chess), invented in late 1994 by Edward Jackman and based on Unachess by Jeff Miller.

The hurricane left hundreds of thousands people without access to their homes or jobs, it separated people from relatives, and caused both physical and mental distress on those who suffered through the storm and its aftermath.Weaver, Jane. \\"Disconnected families coping with fear, stress.\\" NBC News. September 2, 2005. Emergency preparation At the beginning of 2001, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) detailed three unfortunate events that were considered more than probable to happen in the United States. These three included deadly earthquakes in and around San Francisco, an attack in New York City at the hands of a terror group, and a combined hurricane and levee failure in New Orleans. The latter of the three is what would become, four years later, the costliest natural disaster in United States history. This was not the first hurricane, however, that was of concern to local agencies‚Äîthe ones who plan for and execute emergency evacuations, etc. Hurricane Georges, a Category 3 storm, started an evacuation in 1998 but missed downtown New Orleans after heading west several hours before expected landfall. While New Orleans experiences many of the same issues that other coastal cities do in the face of a storm, it also holds its own unique characteristics. The city sits below sea level, at about two feet below sea level at any given place. The Mississippi River, in contrast, sits above sea level by the same difference. At the extremes, though, a part of the city can be ten to fifteen feet below sea level.Wolshon, Brian.Institute of Transportation Engineers. ITE Journal, suppl. ITE 2002 Spring Conference and Exhibit: March 24‚Äì27, 2002; Washington Vol. 72, Iss. 2, (Feb 2002): 44‚Äì49. After Hurricane Georges and Hurricane Floyd in 1999, these stressors created the need for increased drainage and a sustainable levee system. The purpose of the levees on the eastern and western banks of the Mississippi River is to keep water out of the city when levels become high. The juxtaposition of this is that while they may keep water out, after surges and storms overcome the levees, the structures also play a strong role in keeping the water trapped in the city. Continuing years later, inspections on the levees of New Orleans and its various parts of town and parishes details how insufficient these levees are and continue to be. Inspections through the Army Corps of Engineers showed several issues with the levees in place.Zimmermann, K. A. (2015, August 27). Hurricane Katrina: Facts, Damage & Aftermath. Retrieved March 27, 2019 These issues include wall erosion, pounding water, settling/tilting of flood-wall panels, and animal burrowing Schleifstein, M. (2018, May 22). New Orleans area levee system 'high risk,' and 'minimally acceptable', Corps says. Retrieved March 27, 2019, from https://www.nola.com/environment/2018/05/doubts_remain_about_safety_of.html As the city began to grow, drainage and levees were not seen as ‚Äúenough‚Äù when faced with the potential of endangering the 1.4 million persons who called the city their home. Planning for the need to evacuate the population that would be willing and able to evacuate in an emergency, officials implemented a highway contraflow system. With this, all major inbound roads would be flipped to provide extra lanes for outbound purposes. This method was used prior to Hurricane Katrina in nearby states, citing ‚Äúmixed successes‚Äù. Displacement On August 28, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city, the first in its history. Most of the city's residents evacuated, but approximately 100,000‚Äì120,000 remained after the mandatory evacuation order. The Superdome was made available as a shelter for those who were not able to evacuate and did not have protection from the storm. On August 29, about 12,000 people sought shelter between the Superdome and other shelters provided by the Red Cross. The extreme flooding caused by the hurricane later caused an additional 18,000 residents seek shelter at the Superdome and about 20,000 to the New Orleans Convention Center, neither of which were adequately prepared for that high numbers of evacuees. Two weeks after the storm, 75% of evacuees were staying within 250 miles of the homes they lived in prior to the storm and by September 30, 2005 ‚Äì a month after the storm ‚Äì evacuees were registered in all 50 states. After 10 months, only a quarter of residents in the areas of the city that had flooded had returned and the evacuees that had moved away from the city had relocated an average of 3.5 times. In total, it is estimated that over a million people were displaced by Hurricane Katrina. One year after the strike of Hurricane Katrina, about 53% of those displaced, had moved back to New Orleans and 12% were scattered throughout the rest of Louisiana. Of the rest of those who were displaced, about 40% moved to Texas and the rest went farther to either New York, Ohio, or even California. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans Housing Authority managed 7,200 subsidized housing units that were occupied by low income families. After the flooding approximately 3,000 units were identified as significantly damaged and would need to be demolished and rebuilt. Although 3,000 units were destroyed, only 1,829 units were rebuilt and of these less than half met the criteria for subsidized housing. This further increased rental prices in New Orleans and caused the waitlist for subsidized housing became so long that it eventually closed and further prevented many of the lower income families from being able to move back to New Orleans. Some architects question if all of the 3,000 properties really sustained damage significant enough to warrant demolition. It is possible that the city of New Orleans used Hurricane Katrina as an opportunity for disaster capitalism by replacing subsidized housing with new homes to be sold to private owners and not setting priority on building housing that would have helped displaced citizens to return home. President George W. Bush visiting a family displaced by Hurricane Katrina during his September 5, 2005 visit to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Many evacuees from New Orleans, facing months without income, severely damaged or destroyed homes, and little in the way of recoverable possessions have begun expressing desires to permanently resettle elsewhere. But they couldn't find anyone that would take them. Everyone thought they carried diseases.Singer, Audrey; Donato, Katharine M. \\"In Katrina's Wake, Who Will Return? \\" Brookings Institution. September 27, 2005. Possible locations include the areas to which they were evacuated, or with friends or family in other states. This would lead to potentially large demographic effects not only on New Orleans but on the entire country, rivaled only by the Great Migration of African Americans in the first half of the 20th century, and the mass migration of the 1930s as a result of the Great Depression. The effects of this migration are likely to endure for decades as former citizens of New Orleans resettle in other areas yet retain strong cultural ties to New Orleans. Studies have shown that the concentration of poverty is self-perpetuating, thus some postulate that the hurricane may have a small positive impact on future poverty levels.Hymowitz, Kay S. \\"The marriage gap.\\" Dallas Morning News. March 12, 2006. Not only were evacuees displaced, but also some National Guard soldiers returning home from their deployment to Iraq were displaced because they were unable to find homes upon their arrival. By July 2014, it was reported that nearly half of New Orleans neighborhoods have been restored back to over 90% of the residents from before Hurricane Katrina. Demographics of the city had shifted, with fewer African-American and white residents in the city now. This has allowed for a more diverse population with an increased number of Hispanic and Vietnamese residents after the storm. Of all age groups, children were the least likely to return to the city, decreasing the child population by 43%. In August 2015, most of New Orleans had been restored, however, there are still some areas, like the Lower Ninth Ward, that are still undergoing development. There are many open lots where homes use to be and many marsh wetlands with wrecked ships and shipping containers left in open fields. They have rebuilt artificial barrier islands and wetlands just south of New Orleans, with belief that they will help protect the city from future storms that cause sea levels to rise. In 2017, to remember all of the victims of Hurricane Katrina, a memorial sculpture, called the ‚ÄòScrap House‚Äô by artist Sally Heller was built in the heart of New Orleans. Due to the wide displacement caused by Hurricane Katrina, many people were separated from their family members, including young children separated from their parents and pets. A coordinated effort by the American Red Cross, Microsoft, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center, combined many diverse databases and has been very effective in reconnecting children with their parents. An effort to catalogue, identify, or even to collect remains of the dead is still ongoing as of April 2006, leaving those who do not know the whereabouts of loved ones to suffer uncertainty and anxiety. Over time both the reconnection and recovery operations have improved, but it will be much time before the majority of bodies are retrieved and people reunited. While many existing organisations have worked to help those displaced, and some new groups and special efforts have been initiated, the survivors of Hurricane Katrina are still largely unorganized. Survivors have only recently begun to form associations for their own interests in the recovery effort. The largest of these associations is the ACORN Katrina Survivors Association, led by members New Orleans Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). The group has protested Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) policies in both Houston, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and claims over 2,000 members. Health issues Aside from the lack of water, food, shelter, and sanitation facilities, there were concerns that the prolonged flooding might lead to an outbreak of health problems for those who remained in the hurricane-affected areas. In addition to dehydration and food poisoning, there was a potential for communicable disease outbreaks of Cholera and respiratory illness, all related to the growing contamination of food and drinking water supplies in the area. President Bush declared an emergency for the entire Gulf Coast. Before the hurricane, government health officials prepared to respond, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began sending medical emergency supplies to locations near the worst-hit area within 48 hours after landfall. Supplies shipped by CDC's Strategic National Stockpile provided pharmaceuticals, technical assistance teams, and treatment capacity for citizens otherwise stranded by the hurricane's catastrophic effect on hospital infrastructure in Louisiana and Mississippi. These supplies served an estimated 30 acute care hospitals south of Interstate Highway 10, and volunteers organized around its, \\"contingency stations,\\" to become temporary stand-ins for hospitals, warehouses, and distribution facilities damaged by the storm. Alongside strong responses from state and local medical teams, CDC support remained crucial until normal infrastructure support began to return a week and a half later. Within days after landfall, medical authorities established contingency treatment facilities for over 10,000 people, and plans to treat thousands more were developing. Partnerships with commercial medical suppliers, shipping companies, and support services companies insured that evolving medical needs could be met within days or even hours. There was concern the chemical plants and refineries in the area could have released pollutants into the floodwaters. People who suffer from allergies or lung disorders, such as asthma, may have health complications due to toxic mold and airborne irritants, leading to what some health officials have dubbed, \\"Katrina Cough\\". In Gulfport, Mississippi, several hundred tons of chicken and uncooked shrimp were washed out of their containers at the nearby harbor and could have contaminated the water table. On September 6, it was reported that Escherichia coli (E. coli) had been detected at unsafe levels in the waters that flooded New Orleans. The CDC reported on September 7 that five people had died of bacterial infection from drinking water contaminated with Vibrio vulnificus, a bacterium from the Gulf of Mexico. Wide outbreaks of severe infectious diseases such as cholera and dysentery were not considered likely because such illnesses are not endemic in the United States.Staff Writer. \\" After a Hurricane: Infectious Disease .\\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. October 11, 2005.  Mental health  Mental health issues were commonly experienced by residents affected by Hurricane Katrina, especially post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Five to seven months after the hurricane, 20% of people who had evacuated had exhibited mild to moderate mental health issues, 11% had exhibited serious mental health issues, and 16% had been diagnosed with PTSD. One year later, evacuees exhibiting serious mental health issues and being diagnosed with PTSD had increased to 14% and 20%, respectively, which was unusual compared to other natural disasters. Residents of New Orleans with chronic mental health disorders were negatively affected by Hurricane Katrina as well. Before the hurricane, there were 196 practicing psychiatrists in New Orleans; after the hurricane, only 22 of them returned to New Orleans. Hospital rooms available for mental health patients also decreased from 487 to 190 because of the storm. In addition to the increased risk of PTSD, the citizens of New Orleans that had been displaced to Houston, TX endured their own set of unique challenges. The media often covered stories of the increase in crime rate in Houston and often attributed the spike in crime to the displaced citizens of New Orleans which caused some Houstonians to become angry and resentful toward the victims of Hurricane Katrina. This created a moral panic in Houston; a sociological concept that describes the effect of media stories onto its audience. Case studies comparing the crime rates in Houston before and after Hurricane Katrina revealed that there was not a significant increase in crime rate. This moral panic created an unfair stigma onto the victims of Hurricane Katrina and it is believed that this may have led to loss of employment opportunities, barriers in education, and additional psychological stress. Animal issues A stray dog abandoned by its owners approaches a rescue worker in New Orleans. Many animals were left by their owners who could not take them to the evacuation shelters. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 8,000 animals were rescued and brought to temporary shelters set up at the Lamar-Dixon Exposition Center in Gonzales, Louisiana, or the Parker Coliseum at Louisiana State University.Press Release. \\"Reviewing Louisiana Animal Evacuation And Rescue .\\" Federal Emergency Management Agency. November 1, 2005. Most helicopter pilots and rescue boat captains refused to load pets in order to hold more people. Many families in the affected area refused to evacuate without their pets. While some field hospitals allowed pets to enter with their patients, those who were evacuated from the Superdome were not allowed to take their pets with them.Nossiter, Adam. \\"Fights and gunfire break out as New Orleans descends into anarchy .\\" The Brockville Recorder & Times. 2005. One case that attracted national attention was that of Snowball, a small white dog made famous by coverage of an Associated Press reporter, who said, \\"When a police officer confiscated a little boy's dog, the child cried until he vomited. 'Snowball, Snowball', he cried.\\"Snowball, Snowball, the little dog who broke the nation's heart! September 7, 2005. PR Leap Business News. Accessed August 30, 2007. The story of \\"Snowball\\" became a centerpiece in fundraising appeals by welfare organizations and various ad-hoc websites were created by people soliciting funds to help locate Snowball and reunite him with the boy. Rescue teams were set up in the worst hit regions in response to desperate pleas from pet owners. Horses posed a particular problem, as they are easily stranded and cannot stand in water for long periods of time. Rescue agencies set up shelters and tried to find homes to adopt pets lost by their owners. Rescue centers were becoming overwhelmed in the days immediately following the hurricane. Several online resources were set up to give rescue groups, individuals, and businesses from around the country a centralized venue to publish their offers and requests for helping the animals displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Most of the 10,000 fish at the New Orleans Aquarium of the Americas died because the backup power ran out after four days.Staff Writer. \\"Katrina kills most fish in New Orleans aquarium.\\" CNN. September 9, 2005. Most of the marine mammals and a large sea turtle survived. The Audubon Zoo lost only three animals out of a total of 1,400 due to good disaster planning and location on high ground. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) in conjunction with the Louisiana SPCA and many other groups, had hundreds of staff and volunteers working in Louisiana and Mississippi. As of September 20, 2005, 6,031 animals were rescued and 400 were reunited with their owners.Manning, Anita. \\"Animal welfare groups rescue abandoned pets.\\" USA Today. September 3, 2005.

Dalwhinnie refers to its own whisky as a Highland Whisky but as it is located within both the Highland and Speyside region it can legally be called either a Highland or Speyside whisky.\\"The Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009\\" It is owned by Diageo. History The site for the distillery was chosen for its access to clear spring water from Lochan-Doire-Uaine and abundant peat from the surrounding bogs. Set in splendid mountain scenery, Dalwhinnie is the highest distillery in Scotland with a visitors centre at above sea level. The highest distillery is actually Braeval, in Glenlivet at The name Dalwhinnie is derived from Gaelic word Dail Chuinnidh, which means meeting place, referring to the meeting of ancient cattle drovers' routes through the mountains. 1897: John Grant of Grantown-on- Spey, George Sellar of Kingussie, and designer Alexander Mackenzie, also of Kingussie and already a designer of a distillery there, put up an estimated ¬£10,000 to build the Strathspey Distillery at Dalwhinnie between the Great North Road and the Highland Railway. 1898: In February production begins but by the summer the venture was already in liquidation. In October A. P. Blyth buys the distillery for his son and renames it Dalwhinnie announcing ‚Äòconsiderable improvements on the building and plant‚Äô. 1905: The largest distillers in the United States, Cook and Bernheimer, buy the distillery at auction for just ¬£1,250. Many fear the take-over of the Scotch whisky industry. A huge warehouse in Leith blends Dalwhinnie with other whiskies \\"to suit the American palate\\". 1919: Prohibition hits America. Dalwhinnie returns to Scottish hands; they are those of Sir James Calder, chairman of Macdonald Greenlees, also blenders in Leith. 1926: Macdonald Greenlees is itself acquired; by the Distillers Company Ltd. (DCL). Dalwhinnie gains its fifth owner in under thirty years and is licensed to James Buchanan and Co. (famous for the Black and White and Buchanan blends). 1934: A fire in the early hours of 1 February closes the distillery for four years; perhaps coincidentally this is also the year in which electricity first comes to the village, replacing paraffin lamps. 1937: As rebuilding continues, winter snowdrifts high hamper work. 1938: After four years Dalwhinnie re-opens in April, rebuilt and refreshed‚Ä¶ 1940: ‚Ä¶and shuts again, in common with most distilleries, as a result of wartime restrictions on their use of barley. 1961: The wash stills are converted to steam heating from a coal-fired boiler. 1968: The maltings cease production. Barley is now brought in from specialist maltsters for greater control over peatiness and alcohol yield. 1969: British Rail closes the distillery‚Äôs private siding; Dalwhinnie whiskies now leave for the south by road. 1972: Oil-firing replaces coal as modernisation continues. 1987: The distillery becomes part of United Distillers. United Distillers was a Scottish company formed in 1987 combining the businesses of Distillers Company and Arthur Bell & Sons, both owned by Guinness. During a modernisation of the Dalwhinnie plant the traditional worm tubs were removed and shell and tube condensers installed. 1989: Dalwhinnie 15 year old becomes one of the Six Classic Malts of Scotland. 1991: New visitor centre opens. 1994: Dalwhinnie is confirmed by the Met. Office as having the coldest average recorded temperature, , of any inhabited region in Scotland and probably the U.K. 1995: Distillery refitted. Traditional worm tubs are reinstated, having been removed several years earlier. 1997: Diageo was formed in 1997 from the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan and Dalwhinnie became part of the drinks giant‚Äôs portfolio. 1980: The Dalwhinnie Distillers Edition 1980 is released; a second maturation in Oloroso sherry seasoned casks brings out still more depth of character. 1998: A special centenary bottling of Dalwhinnie 15 year old commemorates Dalwhinnie‚Äôs 100th anniversary. 1999: Dalwhinnie 15 Year old and the Dalwhinnie Distillers Edition 1981 are both awarded Monde Selection Gold Medals. 2004: Dalwhinnie 15 year old wins a Gold Medal at the International Wine and Spirit Competition. 2009: Dalwhinnie 15 year old wins Gold (Best in Class) International Wine & Spirit Competition. 2010: Dalwhinnie Manager‚Äôs Choice 1992 is released.

Frank Baum. When Baum died in 1919, the twelve-year-old Snow offered to be the next Royal Historian of Oz, but was politely turned down by a staffer at Baum's publisher, Reilly & Lee.David L. Greene and Dick Martin, The Oz Scrapbook, New York, Random House, 1977; p. 78. Snow eventually wrote two Oz books: The Magical Mimics in Oz (1946) and The Shaggy Man of Oz (1949), as well as Who's Who in Oz (1954), a thorough guide to the Oz characters, all of which Reilly & Lee published. In his second year in high school, the precocious Snow created the first radio review column in American journalism, in The Cincinnati Enquirer.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; p. 276. After graduation, Snow pursued a career in print journalism and primarily in radio, with periods in teachers college and the U. S. Army. He named the Ohio radio station WING, and spent seven years with the National Broadcasting Company in New York. In 1944, he attempted to get NBC to produce a radio series based on the stories of fellow Weird Tales author Ray Bradbury. Snow published five stories in Weird Tales over the space of two decades: \\"Night Wings,\\"(Sept 1927); \\"Poison,\\" (Dec 1928); \\"Second Childhood,\\" (Mar 1945); \\"Seed,\\" (Jan 1946); and \\"Midnight,\\" (May 1946). These were all included in Dark Music and Other Spectral Tales(1947) with the exception of \\"Second Childhood\\".Sheldon Jaffrey and Fred Cook, The Collector's Index to Weird Tales, Bowling Green, OH, Bowling Green State University Popular Press, 1985; p. 116. A full description of each tale in the collection appears in the entry on Snow in E.F. Bleiler's Guide to Supernatural Fiction E.F. Bleiler, The Guide to Supernatural Fiction, Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1983, pp. 466‚Äì67. Snow also published several letters in the letters column of Weird Tales over the years. \\"Seed\\" has also been reprinted in Marvin Kaye's 1988 anthology Weird Tales: The Magazine That Never Dies\\". When Snow assembled his 1947 collection Dark Music he wanted it to include a dozen of his best stories, including one of his more sinister tales, ‚ÄúMidnight,‚Äù which had appeared in the May 1946 issue of Weird Tales with Bradbury's story \\"The Smiling People.\\" Later, Bradbury agreed to write the foreword for the volume. But the publisher insisted on padding the volume with a number of Snow's stories that were juvenilia. Bradbury, only twenty-six years old at the time, had agreed to write a foreword for Snow's collection but he reneged when he read these additions, rejecting them as \\"patently unpublishable\\". It has been rumored that the jackets for all copies of Jack Snow's book, Dark Music and Other Spectral Tales, (whose cover art is by Ronald Clyne ‚Äì his first published book jacket) had to be overstamped with a bar of ink, to block out Bradbury's name- but no copy has ever surfaced with such a bar of ink. A facsimile of the jacket can be seen here: Snow wrote to Bradbury \\"You are a literary craftsman with ambitions to become a skilled and recognized artist in the field. I have no such ambitions. I want to write because I enjoy it.\\" Snow also wrote a short story, \\"A Murder in Oz,\\" for Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, but the editors rejected it, and it was posthumously published in The Baum Bugle. That story has been published in a recent collection titled Spectral Snow (Hungry Tiger Press, 1996), which collects several of the horror stories Snow sold to popular magazines, such as Weird Tales. There is a good deal of overlap between Snow's two collections but each contains stories not found in the other. The eponymous story has been anthologized in other collections.

It lies on the North Sea coast of England, from London and from Colchester. It was constructed in the 1930s as a holiday resort for Londoners, but over time has become one of the most deprived areas in the country. The land on which the village is built was originally fields and salt marsh and unsuitable for agriculture. It was purchased by the entrepreneur Frank Stedman in 1928 to build low cost, affordable holiday homes for working- class families, and became a popular holiday destination throughout the 1930s. After the Second World War, a shortage of housing meant the properties became permanently inhabited despite not being built for this purpose. Many holiday homes are now in a state of disrepair, and the local community have resisted demolition. Jaywick has significant problems with unemployment and is at risk of flooding, despite several attempts by the local council to transform the area. Location Martello Tower, now an arts centre Jaywick is around from London and southeast of Colchester. It in the Golf Green ward of the Tendring district of north-east Essex. To the north-east is Clacton-on-Sea (from which it is separated by Clacton Airfield), while to the west is the estuary of the River Colne. Jaywick is divided into the Tudor estate to the north (also known as West Clacton), the Village to the southeast and the Brooklands and Grasslands estates to the southwest. Most shops are on the village's main street, Broadway. A 200-year-old Martello tower on the coastline was converted into an arts and heritage centre. The artwork, \\"46 Brooklands Gardens\\", by Nathan Coley was erected at the Martello tower as a three-month show piece. History What is now Jaywick was originally fields and salt marshes near Clacton and St Osyth. The name, which was first recorded in 1438 in the form Clakyngewyk, means \\"dwelling associated with a man named *Clacc\\". The first element was later dropped, giving at first Gey wyck (1584) and eventually the modern form. A wooden spear from the Lower Paleolithic era, found locally in an area of foreshore erosion, is the oldest known man-made wooden artefact found in the British Isles. During the 19th century, the area was popular for shooting and contained a rifle range. Because of its close proximity to the sea, Jaywick had never been a practical place for farming due to the risk from floods; and the land remained unused. A sea wall was built in 1880 to protect against flooding. Ordnance Survey mapping around 1897 shows Jaywick as a few farmhouses near what is now Crossways on the Tudor estate. A typical street in Jaywick in 2009 By the turn of the 20th century, campaigners such as William Morris had attempted to convince people of the virtues of self-sufficient communities for poor families away from large cities, which led to developments such as Peacehaven in Sussex in 1914. Jaywick was proposed by property developer Frank Stedman in 1928 as a cheap holiday retreat for Londoners. Stedman had noticed the popularity of Clacton as a holiday resort and believed that he could sell small plots of land to East End residents on which holiday homes could be built. Residents were encouraged to buy land and self-build properties, with plots being offered as little as ¬£25 (), while Stedman convinced buyers that a house could be built for as little as ¬£395 (). An initial emphasis was on well-being, health and fitness, with outdoor exercises being popular. However, Stedman was motivated primarily by money rather than altruism, and while he discussed plans for landscaping the development, along with a lake and a sports centre, these never materialised. The original estate was developed in the shape of a car radiator grille, with the roads named after various vehicle manufacturers. Coaches regularly picked up holidaymakers throughout the 1930s from Ilford and Romford. The Jaywick Miniature Railway, an gauge miniature railway operated in Jaywick from 1936 to 1939. The locomotive was a model of a GNR Stirling 4-2-2. An abandoned house in Jaywick in 2009 Plotland development elsewhere in Britain was bulldozed following the Second World War, and various attempts were made by the local council to demolish Jaywick, but there was resistance from residents, who campaigned against this and won a preservation order in 1970. The council were unhappy about a housing development sitting on such a flood-prone site, and modern conveniences were slow in arriving. A mains sewer system was only installed in 1977. In 1978, the local council issued an \\"Article 4 Direction\\" to control housing development in Jaywick. Under this direction, planning permission is required for home improvements that would not normally be needed elsewhere, including all extensions, porches and garden structures. The direction was further revised in 2010. In the 1990s, forty prefabricated houses were built on adjacent land on a former holiday camp to rehouse residents of some of the most dilapidated properties. Despite winning several architectural awards and being praised by the local council, only five of the older properties were demolished. The original development along Brooklands has faced demolition, particularly with respect to dilapidated properties, and vacant sites nearby have been purchased to provide new homes. New permanent residences in Brooklands are prohibited by council regulations. Tendring District Council hope that by 2026, the area will change sufficiently to be attractive for development, and to provide a self-sufficient service based economy for tourism. Social issues An Arcade in Jaywick in 2009 Despite being marketed as holiday homes, many of the original houses became permanent residences due to post-war housing shortages in London and by 1950 there was a significant year-round population. Jaywick now includes large numbers of retired and unemployed people. A 2011 report in The Guardian found that 62% of working age residents in Jaywick received benefits, compared to 15% national average. A subsequent report in 2015 reiterated the area was one of the most deprived English neighbourhoods. According to the Index of Multiple Deprivation of both 2010 and 2015, the eastern half of the village is the most deprived area of England. According to the Citizens Advice Bureau, 40% of residents are unable to work due to a disability or long term illness. 60% of pupils at Frobisher Primary School, on the edge of the village, receive free school meals. A 2009 report found that four out of Eastern England's ten cheapest streets in which to buy property are in Jaywick, with property on Tamarisk Way selling for an average of ¬£44,050. A 2013 report in The Guardian showed that bungalows were being sold on the Brooklands estate for around ¬£20,000. In 2010 Jaywick was assessed as the most deprived area in England. In September 2015 it was again named as the most deprived, according to the indices of deprivation based on several factors including poverty, crime, education and skill levels, unemployment and housing, after being assessed in 2012‚Äì13. Referring to the older estates in Jaywick, the headmistress of Frobisher Primary School said \\"When you go to certain parts of it, you are quite shocked that you are in England.\\" In 2012 Jaywick was labelled the UK's youth unemployment hotspot. Randeep Ramesh, writing in The Guardian, noted that there has been little employment available since the Butlins holiday camp closed in 1983. Local charity Signpost has helped young people find employment, which has become difficult due to many jobs being a significant distance away in Colchester or Ipswich. Tightening of building regulations has meant that simple builders jobs for cash are now illegal without appropriate health and safety training. Drug abuse is a particular problem in the area. Because of the area's reputation for economic deprivation, private developers are unwilling to invest there. In August 2013 a \\"one mile fresh food challenge\\" in Jaywick, organised by The Big Issue, found only \\"a bag of blackened bananas\\" and \\"potatoes at ¬£2.29 per 2kg\\". The former Mermaid Inn in Brooklands Avenue in 2011, which was left derelict after a fire The local controlling council, Tendring District Council, are working with the residents of Brooklands on improving the area and trying to buy up land to build new housing. Council leader Mick Page stated \\"The only way we will start anything in Jaywick is for us to lead it. We will be the catalyst.\\" The council are proposing to stop the allocation of housing benefit to rented properties in Jaywick by 2017, to discourage rental in poor quality buildings. Former council leader Neil Stock has called Jaywick \\"an embarrassment to the whole country\\", blaming planning regulations he believes are draconian. Stock reported around 30 to 40 absentee landlords were renting poor quality accommodation to tenants on benefits without requiring any deposit, adding that \\"the state is subsidising squalor.\\" Carswell has been critical of the government's response to Jaywick, noting that although the area contained large numbers of unemployed, these were often people who were unable to find work both due to disabilities or a lack of available jobs. He believes the \\"downward spiral will continue\\" unless existing planning laws are relaxed and the area has economic investment. In 2011, the council complained to the Prime Minister David Cameron, asking him to lobby the Committee for the 2012 London Olympics to ensure the Olympic torch passed near Jaywick, the only one of the ten most deprived wards in England it would not pass close to. The Jaywick Community Resource Centre sits on a former boating lake in Brooklands, and provides support to local residents. In 2010, two film makers compiled a documentary, Jaywick Escapes, which showed life in the village. The film combined archive footage from the estate's early years alongside recent interviews with recovering heroin addicts living in Jaywick. It was shown at the 2012 East End Film Festival and an extract was subsequently shown at the Science Museum. In 2015, \\" Jaywick ‚Äì Benefits by the Sea\\" aired on Channel 5. The programme looked at residents of the dilapidated town and their lifestyles. It included a 60-year-old man who claimed he had not been sober since he was 15. A few residents of the Tudor Estate, outside the main deprived areas complained and asked the Royal Mail to remove the name Jaywick from their postal address. An image of the village was used in an attack ad by congressional candidate Nick Stella during the 2018 midterm elections. The advert subsequently received angry criticism from residents and Tendring District Council Cabinet Member Paul Honeywood, saying \\"I know that many Jaywick Sands residents will be outraged at being smeared in this way, and rightly so.\\" Stella has since apologised and a spokesperson for the Stella campaign said \\"our intent was never to make fun of the town\\". Environmental risk During the North Sea flood of 1953, Jaywick was flooded, resulting in the deaths of 35 people. Since then, sea defences have been put in place and many precautions have been made to avoid flooding. Coastal Jaywick has benefited from 30,000 cubic metres of dredged sand as part of a ¬£9.4 million upgrade. The residential areas are categorised as having the highest risk of flooding in the country, and a council report anticipated that global warming would increase the risk to human life in Jaywick from flooding over the next 50 to 75 years. The area would be the first to be hit by floods in the event of a tidal surge over the marshes surrounding St Osyth. The main road into the village is close to sea level and there is risk that a flood could cut off access for emergency services. Many roads, particularly around Brooklands, are unadopted without any public funding, hindering emergency access and giving the area a \\"run down\\" look. Because properties are sited on marshland, road improvements tend to have a short lifespan and are quickly damaged in bad weather. In December 2013, due to a severe flood risk, all residents in Jaywick were asked by Essex Police to temporarily leave the area, to be homed in school buildings around Clacton. A similar exercise happened in January 2017 following a threat of coastal flooding, involving the potential evacuation of 2,500 homes in Jaywick and nearby Lee-over-Sands.

It is located in Andersonstown Road in the west of the city, and named after the republican revolutionary Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). it had an official capacity of 32,282, with safety certification for 31,661, including 6,962 seated.; It is currently closed and in a state of dereliction, with redevelopment plans pending now for several years. History Casement Park, one of the largest stadia in Ulster, opened in June 1953, with Armagh Harps defeating St John‚Äôs of Antrim in the final of the inaugural Ulster Senior Club Football Championship. The newly opened Casement Park hosted the Ulster Championship final less than a month later, which saw Armagh overcome reigning All-Ireland champions Cavan. The ground's location in a republican neighbourhood saw incidents during the Troubles which contributed to unionist perception of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) as pro-republican. Rallies against the introduction of internment were held on 12 September 1971 and 19 March 1972. It was occupied by the British Army from Operation Motorman on 31 July 1972 until October 1973. Provisional IRA members displayed weapons at a rally there in August 1979. In March 1988, two Army corporals who drove into a republican funeral cort√®ge were interrogated in Casement Park before being shot on nearby waste ground. Anniversaries of the 1981 hunger strike were marked by rallies at the stadium in 2001 and 2006, against the wishes of the GAA Central Council.; , cited in In all, Casement Park has hosted eight Ulster football finals. However, the Antrim ground has not held the provincial showpiece since 1971, with St. Tiernach's Park in Clones hosting the final every year since except between 2004 and 2006 when it was moved to Croke Park such was the demand for tickets. A major facelift of the stadium took place in 2000, a move which saw more championship games played at Casement Park. In 2006, floodlights were added which allowed hurling and football to be played in the evening. On 14 November 2016 Casement Park was officially included as part of Ireland's 2023 Rugby World Cup bid, which in 2017 lost to France. Redevelopment In 2006, proposals were raised to build a new multi-purpose stadium on the site of the old Maze prison near Lisburn, which was intended to host association football, rugby union and Gaelic games. However, opposition to the idea led to it being dropped in favour of a new venue in the Sydenham area of East Belfast. This led to Ulster GAA, which was one of the partners in the Maze project, to pull out in favour of remaining at Casement Park.Plans for ¬£128m Belfast stadium unveiled - The Independent, 25 March 2009 Plans to redevelop Casement Park were announced in 2009, though it was not until 2011 that the Northern Ireland Executive announced that it had granted ¬£138m for various stadium redevelopment projects throughout Northern Ireland, of which Ulster GAA would receive ¬£61.4m to be used to redevelop Casement Park into a 40,000 all-seated stadium. A further ¬£15 million was proposed from the Central Council of the Gaelic Athletic Association. If the plans had been approved, the venue would become the largest stadium in Ulster.Stadiums fit for our heroes on way at last - Belfast Telegraph, 11 March 2011 In early 2012 it was announced that the redevelopment work would start at the end of 2013 with a view to having the new stadium open by September 2015. It was expected that, after its completion, Ulster GAA would move its headquarters from St Tiernach's Park in Clones to the redeveloped Casement Park.Ulster Council rubber-stamps Casement Park stadium move - BBC News, 17 February 2012 Local residents of West Belfast objected to the proposal and in September 2013 the Mooreland and Owenvarragh Residents Association (MORA) issued a formal petition and letter of objection to the Northern Ireland Department of Environment, describing the new stadium plans \\"a monstrosity\\" and too expansive. The residents filed a lawsuit as the date for the commencement of construction continued to be delayed. In December 2014 the High Court ruled a ministerial decision granting planning approval for the redevelopment of the stadium was unlawful, setting the proposal back further. Ulster GAA responded with disappointment to the decision, though vowed to re- submit an improved design. They did so in October 2016, unveiling a smaller scale project with a reduced capacity of 34,500. This design was unable to achieve planning approval permission, as Northern Ireland's power-sharing government was dissolved in March 2017. This delay saw the anticipated total cost of the project blow out to approximately ¬£110 million. Antrim's 14 point \\"home\\" loss to Tyrone in the 2019 Ulster Senior Football Championship quarter- final in Armagh highlighted the run-down status of the Casement Park pitch and grandstands. The GAA stated it was hopeful of receiving planning permission for the redevelopment in mid-Spring 2020. This eventually came in October 2020 when Minister for Infrastructure Nichola Mallon recommended planning approval. The stadium is currently scheduled to open in summer 2023 but the project still faces funding uncertainties.

Amico Aspertini (c. 1474 - 1552), also called Amerigo Aspertini, was an Italian Renaissance painter and sculptor whose complex, eccentric, and eclectic style anticipates Mannerism. He is considered one of the leading exponents of the Bolognese School of painting. Biography He was born in Bologna to a family of painters (including Giovanni Antonio Aspertini, his father, and Guido Aspertini, his brother), and studied under masters such as Lorenzo Costa and Francesco Francia. He traveled to Rome with his father in 1496, and is briefly documented there again between 1500‚Äì1503, returning to Bologna thereafter and painting in a style influenced by Pinturicchio and Filippino Lippi (whose work the critic Roberto Longhi suggested [in Officina ferrarese, 1934] he may have seen in Florence before 1500). To his Roman years belong at least two collections of drawings, the \\"Parma Notebook\\" (Taccuino di Parma) and the Wolfegg Codex. In Bologna in 1504, he joined Francia and Costa in painting frescoes for the Oratory of Santa Cecilia next to San Giacomo Maggiore, a work commissioned by Giovanni II Bentivoglio. In 1508-1509, while in exile from Bologna following the fall of the Bentivoglio family, Aspertini painted the splendid frescoes in the Chapel of the Cross in the Basilica di San Frediano in Lucca (a church, like the Oratory of Santa Cecilia, maintained by Augustinian friars). Aspertini was also one of two artists chosen to decorate a triumphal arch for the entry into Bologna of Pope Clement VII and Emperor Charles V in 1529. He produced sculptures for doors in San Petronio Basilica in Bologna. Aspertini also painted fa√ßade decorations (all now lost), and altarpieces. Many of his works are often eccentric and charged in expression. For example, the Piet√† he painted inside San Petronio appears to occur in an other-worldly electric sky. His Tuscan near-contemporary Giorgio Vasari described Aspertini (in The Lives) as having an eccentric, half-insane personality. According to Vasari, he was ambidextrous and worked so rapidly with both hands that he was able to divide chiaroscuro between them, painting chiaro with one hand and scuro with the other. Vasari also quotes Aspertini as complaining that all his Bolognese colleagues were copying Raphael. He died in Bologna.

The series focused on the police station and crime in the Victorian town of Matlock and the surrounding district, and the backgrounds and personal lives of the main policemen.  Background  The series was the 0-10 Network's attempt to come up with a police show to rival Homicide (shown by the Seven Network) and Division 4 (on the Nine Network). Matlock Police was different from its Melbourne-based predecessors by being set in a small country town, the fictional Matlock, Victoria (a real Matlock does exist in Victoria, but it is much smaller than the town depicted by this series, which is loosely based on Shepparton). These program's introduction featured an overhead shot of a town with a divided road, thought to be of Bairnsdale in Victoria. Series writers had a reference manual giving full details of the town‚Äôs geography, amenities, social structure, etc., as well as that of the surrounding area - neighbouring towns included Wilga, Chinaman's Creek, Possum's Creek and Burrabri, and there was an offshoot of the Great Dividing Range called the Candowies. The town's colourful history included the local Aboriginal tribe (the ‚ÄòBangerang‚Äô), the town founder (George Matlock), a gold rush, a bushranger (‚ÄòHoly‚Äô Joe Cooper - so called both for his theft of a shipment of holey dollars and because he was a preacher) and a town patriarchy (the Falconers). About the only landmark the Matlock district lacked for dramatic purposes was a beach.In episode 123, \\"Ski-Do\\", Maddern and Hogan are asked by the local police to investigate a disappearance on the slopes of \\"Mount Keira\\" (filmed at Fall's Creek). Broadcast history The first episode was broadcast in Melbourne on 22 February 1971. Initially filmed in black and white, the series switched to colour in episode 162, \\"Loggerheads\\". Matlock Police was cancelled in 1975 after 229 episodes had been produced (while the final episode is numbered 228, an earlier episode had an A suffix, making a total of 229). Main cast * Detective Sergeant (later Detective Senior SergeantIn accordance with Victoria Police Force changes, Detective Sergeant Maddern became Detective Senior Sergeant and Sergeant Kennedy became Senior Sergeant Kennedy.) Vic Maddern (Michael Pate), head of Matlock's C.I. (Criminal Investigation) Branch, who grew up in the Matlock district and is an accomplished bushman and career cop (apart from a spell in the army where he fought in Korea). Aged in his forties, Maddern is divorced and has two children (his wife Kay is moving out in the first episodes). Dedicated, with an authoritative personality and a direct approach to his work, Maddern is well respected in the town. Maddern is eventually shot and severely wounded in mountainous bushland while pursuing small-time cattle-duffers and is evacuated to Melbourne for treatment (episode 192, \\"Have A Good Weekend\\"). Dialogue in later episodes indicates that he is recovering from his wounds, but will probably be transferred to a Melbourne squad once out of hospital. * Senior Detective Alan Curtis (Grigor Taylor), aged in his mid-20s, who has just arrived in Matlock from Melbourne and is essentially a city boy, sent to his first country posting against his will. Curtis eventually adapts to country life, and his character and abilities develop as he becomes more experienced in his new situation. He is eventually promoted to Detective Sergeant and transferred back to Melbourne (episode 99, \\"Dingo Hunter\\"). * Sergeant (later Senior Sergeant) Bert Kennedy (Vic Gordon), head of the Uniform Branch, an Englishman who migrated to Australia in 1950. Kennedy is thorough but also easy-going with a good sense of humour. Married to Nell (Natalie Raine), who is a very good cook, Kennedy enjoys the country life in Matlock so much that he has knocked back promotion to avoid moving to Melbourne. * Senior Constable Gary Hogan (Paul Cronin), about 30, a friendly, easy-going person who grew up in the country, and is always willing to help in whatever work is going, who performs a wide variety of duties but usually works as a highway patrolman. His motorcycle is equipped with a radio (callsign 'Solo One') - a rare case of dramatic licence by Crawfords (normally very faithful to police procedure), as police motorbikes at the time were not equipped with radios.In a case of life imitating art, Victoria Police outfitted their motorbikes with radios. The character also made an impact in another way, making motorcycle cops far more acceptable to the Australian public, which had previously seen them as \\"heavies and storm-trooper types\\". According to series producer Ian Jones, as a result men were applying to join the police so they could be a motorcycle cop like Gary Hogan. In the final episode, \\"The Curse of the Bangarang Prince\\", Hogan is notified of a posting to the town of Emerald - the setting for his spinoff series Solo One. * Senior Detective Steve York (Tom Richards), a young detective transferred to Matlock to replace Curtis (episode 100, \\"Bedlam\\"), who is a bit unorthodox, a bit headstrong, and a bit of a rebel and ladies' man. * Detective Sergeant Jack Maloney (Peter Gwynne), transferred to Matlock from another country town to replace Maddern as head of the C.I. Branch (episode 196, \\"Welcome To Matlock\\").Michael Pate had refused to extend his contract for a further three episodes to cover the gap before Peter Gwynne's arrival, so York was left on his own in C.I. Branch and Pate edited out of the opening credits. Ironically, Gwynne had previously appeared as a quirky Homicide detective alongside Pate in episode 155, \\"Nothing Man\\". In his mid-forties, married to a much younger wife and with two young children, Maloney is a friendly person with a warm personality, a dry sense of humour, a pilot's license and a sympathetic streak who comes down hard on criminals when necessary. Guest cast A notable guest star was George Lazenby who appeared in a 1974 episode \\"In the Name of the Queen\\" (inspired by the case of Ronnie Biggs and the Great Train Robbery). Other noted Australian actors who made early appearances on the series include Andrew McFarlane, Jack Thompson, Robert McDarra, Judy Morris and Sigrid Thornton. After the sudden death of character actor Stewart Ginn in September 1971, Hector Crawford praised his performance in the episode titled \\"The Word is Progress\\" as one of the finest dramatic performances to come out of the Crawfords company. Featured vehicles Vehicles featured through the series included the HG Holden Monaro (base model), which featured until Crawford's contract with Chrysler Australia commenced, with a Holden Kingswood wagon also being featured as the station's general purpose vehicle. The Monaro and Kingswood were followed by VH and VJ Valiant Ranger models. A short wheelbase FJ40 Toyota Land-cruiser also featured. Gary Hogan rode a CB750 motorcycle for most of the series, which replaced a BMW R75 used in earlier episodes.

He was a composer, pianist, conductor and teacher. After an early career as a performer and composer, he was a teacher in the Royal Academy of Music in London and was its principal from 1832 to 1859. Life and career =Early years= Potter was born in London to a musical family. He was the third son of the seven children of Richard Huddleston Potter (1755‚Äì1821), a flautist, violinist, and teacher, and his wife, Charlotte, n√©e Baumgarten (1757‚Äì1837). The name Cipriani, by which he was known throughout his life, came from his godmother, who was said to have been a sister of the artist Giovanni Battista Cipriani.Olleson, Philip. \\"Potter, (Philip) Cipriani Hambley (1792‚Äì1871)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 28 November 2017 When Potter was seven his musical instruction began, first with his father and then with Thomas Attwood, William Crotch and, from 1805 to 1810, Joseph W√∂lfl. The last, who, like Attwood, was a former pupil of Mozart, is considered by the biographer Philip Olleson to have been the teacher who most influenced the young Potter. At 21 Potter was accepted as an associate member of the recently founded Philharmonic Society, and was elected to full membership in 1815. The following year the society commissioned an overture in E minor from him, and he featured in subsequent concerts both as composer and performer. He made his debut as a pianist in his own sextet for piano, flute, and strings, Op. 11, another commission from the society, in April 1816.Peter, Philip Henry and Julian Rushton. \\"Potter, Cipriani\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 28 November 2017 =Vienna and concert career= In 1817 Potter travelled to Vienna, where he stayed for eight months, before moving on to other cities in Austria and Germany and then going to Italy. Looking back at Potter's life, the composer and academic Sir George Macfarren observed in 1884 that Potter's temporary residence in continental Europe was \\"as much for the purpose of study as for the sake of obtaining experience of other musical performances than were to be heard in London. At that time London was not, as it is now, the centre of all that is to be heard in music.\\"Macfarren, George. \\"Cipriani Potter: His Life and Work\\", Proceedings of the Musical Association, 10th Session (1883‚Äì1884), pp. 41‚Äì56 In Vienna, Potter met Beethoven, who approved of him, but declined to teach him composition, advising him to study with Aloys F√∂rster. Beethoven nevertheless read some of Potter's compositions and gave him his comments. Potter later published an article, \\"Recollections of Beethoven\\" in Musical World, making clear his great admiration and affection.Reprinted in The Musical Times in 1861: Potter, Cipriani. \\"Recollections of Beethoven, with Remarks on His Style\\", The Musical Times, vol. 10, no. 226, 1861, pp. 150‚Äì157. During his time in Italy, Potter developed an admiration of Italian opera, and particularly the works of Rossini.Dibble, Jeremy (2017). Notes to Hyperion CD CDA68151, The Romantic Piano Concerto, No 72 Twelve years later he wrote Variazioni di bravura on a theme by Rossini, using a melody from Matilde di Shabran. Returning to England in 1819, Potter became a central figure in London concert life as both a pianist and conductor. He regularly programmed the piano concertos of Mozart, which were scarcely known in London: there had been only six performances of a Mozart piano concerto there before Potter's return. He gave regular performances of at least nine of them. He also gave the English premieres of Beethoven's Third and Fourth piano concertos. =Royal Academy of Music and later years= In 1822, Potter began teaching at the newly founded Royal Academy of Music, first piano and later conducting the orchestra. In 1832 he became principal, holding the post for 27 years, a tenure surpassed in length only by that of Alexander Mackenzie. His students included William Sterndale Bennett, Edward Collett May, and Joseph Barnby. As he focused more on his educational work and preparing editions of Mozart and Beethoven keyboard music, he composed less and less often. There are few works written after 1837. He maintained a keen interest in new music from the continent, championing the works of Schumann and, in his later years, Brahms. According to Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, \\"Potter's influence as a teacher was great; a man of ready wit and generosity, he was much admired and loved.\\" In 1871 Potter's last appearance in concert was in the first British performance of Brahms's German Requiem, in the version with two-piano accompaniment, with the pianist Kate Loder. He died on 26 September of that year at his home near Hyde Park, London, and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. Music =Orchestral= Potter seems to have adopted two separate and contradictory systems for the numbering of his symphonies of which nine are extant, the same total being quoted in contemporary commentary: one based on the order of composition (hence those styled 1, 6, 7, 8 and 10) and another based on key (hence the G minor symphony of 1832 is also styled number 2, i.e. the second G minor symphony whilst the two D major symphonies are styled numbers 2 and 4, i.e. the second and fourth D major symphonies). Thus it is possible to surmise that several works, including both a first and a third D major symphony, were lost or destroyed. This has led to considerable confusion which the following list seeks to clarify by adopting a simple chronology. * Overture in E minor (1815, revised 1848) * Symphony [No. 1] in G minor (1819, revised 1824‚Äì26) [styled No. 1 by the composer] * Symphony [No. 2] in B major (1821, revised 1839) [unnumbered by the composer] * Symphony [No. 3] in C minor (1826) [styled No. 6 by the composer] * Symphony [No. 4] in F major (1826) [styled No. 7 by the composer] * Symphony [No. 5] in E major (1828, revised 1846 with replacement slow movement) [styled No. 8 by the composer] * Symphony [No. 6] in G minor (1832) [styled both No. 10 and No. 2 by the composer] * Symphony [No. 7] in D major (1833) [styled No. 2 by the composer] * Symphony [No. 8] in C minor (1834) [unnumbered by the composer] * Symphony [No. 9] in D major (1834) [styled No. 4 by the composer] * Antony and Cleopatra, overture (1835) * Cymbeline, overture (1836) * The Tempest overture (1837) * March (1854) =Concertante= * Introduction and Rondo Alla Militaire for piano and orchestra (1827) * Duo concertante for piano, violin and orchestra (1827) * Concertante for violin, cello, double bass, piano and orchestra on Les folies d'Espagne * Bravura Variations on a theme by Rossini for piano and orchestra (1829) * Ricercata 'on a favourite French theme for piano and orchestra (1830) * Piano Concerto in D minor (1832) * Piano Concerto in E major (1833) * Piano Concerto in E major (1835) =Chamber= * Grand Trios for clarinet, bassoon and piano * * No.1 in E major * * No 2 in D major * * No 3 in B major * Piano trio, Op. 12 (c. 1824) * Sonata di bravura for horn and piano, Op. 13 (alternative version for bassoon, cello and piano) (c. 1824) * Sextet for flute, string quartet and piano, Op. 11 (c. 1827) * Sextet in E major, for flute, cello, viola cello, bouble basse and piano (1836) * String Quartet in G major (1837) =Piano= (Solo except where otherwise stated) * 3 Waltzes in German Style (1816) * Recueil de valzers (1816) * Trio, piano 5 hands (c. 1816) * Andante \\"La placidit√†\\" (1817) * Sonata, C, Op. 1 (1818) * Variations on Mozart's \\"Fin ch'han dal vino\\", Op. 2 (1816) * Sonata in D major, Op. 3 (1818) * Sonata in E minor Op. 4 (1818) * Polonaise (1818) * Rondeau (1818) * Thirteen Variations, on \\"Bekr√§nzt mit Laub\\" (c. 1818) * [no.1] (c. 1818) * Fantasia, March and Trio (c. 1820) * Grand duo, piano 4 hands, Op. 6 (c. 1821) * Fantasia, on \\"Chi dice mal d'amore\\" (c. 1822) * Mes r√™veries (c. 1823) * Le d√©part de Vienne (c. 1823) * Pezzi di bravura, Op. 15 (c. 1824) * Andante and Allegretto \\"Il compiacente\\", Op. 16 (c. 1824) * The Parade, military divertimento, Op. 17 (c. 1824) * Impromptu, on the Scottish air \\"Auld Robin Gray\\", Op. 8 (1825) * Enigma Variations, Op. 5 (c. 1825) * 3 Toccatas, Op. 9 * Studies in All the Major and Minor Keys, Op. 19 (1826) * Introduction and Rondo giocoso, Op. 20 (c. 1826) * Introduction and Variations, with coda and cadenza (c. 1826) * Allegro di bravura \\"Il vispo e la fuggita\\" (before 1827) * no.2, Op. 21 (1827) * Fugue in E major for 3 pianos (1827) * Fantasia and Fugue for 2 pianos (c. 1818) * 54 Impromptus, Op. 22 (1832) * Celebrated Octave Lesson (1834‚Äì48) * Introduction and Variations, on \\"Alice Gray\\" (before 1837) * Impromptu in B (1841) * 3 amusements, Op. 28 (c. 1848‚Äì51) * Impromptu in D (c. 1850) * Introduction and Rondoletto, Op. 23 (c. 1851) * Impromptu in G major and G minor * Eine Grille (1868) * Rondo scherzando \\"Il sollievo\\" (undated) =Vocal= * When evening draws her curtain round, for voice and piano (c. 1817) * No More, canzonet, for voice and piano (1825) * Medora e Corrado, cantata for solo voices, chorus and orchestra (1830) ::Source: Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians. In the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Philip Olleson writes that Potter's most productive period as a composer was between his return to Britain 1819 and 1837 after which he produced hardly any music. Olleson comments that although in the list of Potter's works those for solo piano greatly outnumber his other compositions, it is the nine surviving symphonies that are the most important, and show \\"many effective touches of orchestration and a good deal of counterpoint and imitation\\". In the article on Potter in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Philip Peter and Julian Rushton express regret that Potter gave up composing, and consider some of his works \\"masterly\\": they instance \\"at least half a dozen of the symphonies\\", the G major String Quartet, the Sextet for flute, clarinet, viola, cello, double bass and piano and the three overtures to plays by Shakespeare. The music writer Lewis Foreman comments that Potter's was the first body of symphonic works by a British composer.Foreman, Lewis (2004). Notes to Classico CD CLASSCD634 The British Symphonic Collection, Vol. 14 In Foreman's view, the symphonies are, for their time, ambitious in their use of the orchestra, showing the influence of early Beethoven, and reminiscent of Schubert's symphonies although the latter were completely unknown in Britain at the time.

Career Born in San Sebasti√°n, Basque Country, Spain, in 1968, Lazkano attended piano and composition classes at the San Sebasti√°n Higher Conservatory of Music, where he obtained a Higher Degree in Composition. Holding a Gipuzkoako Foru Diputazioa scholarship, he was accepted at the Conservatoire National Sup√©rieur de Musique of Paris, where he studied composition and orchestration with Alain Bancquart and G√©rard Grisey, and was awarded a First Prize of Composition in 1990. A Sasakawa Foundation Scholarship allowed him to follow the studies of composition and analysis in Montreal with Gilles Tremblay. At his return to Paris, he studied orchestra conducting with Jean-S√©bastien B√©reau and Arturo Tamayo, and received a DEA degree in 20th Century Music and Musicology from the'Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales. His piano concerto Hitzaurre Bi earned him, at the age of 26, the prestigious Prince Pierre de Monaco Foundation Prize. Shortly afterwards, in 1997, a jury chaired by Luciano Berio gave him the Leonard Bernstein-Jerusalem Composition Prize for his Auhen Kantuak. In 2007, the French Academy of Fine Arts gives him the Georges Bizet Award; he was also a prizewinner of the Institute of Music and Drama Arts, the Colegio de Espa√±a, and the Gaudeamus Foundation. While resident with the Joven Orquesta Nacional de Espa√±a, he had the opportunity of composing several pieces which were performed, among others, at the Auditorio Nacional in Madrid and Berlin Konzerthaus. Stanford University invited him in 1999 to introduce his music and that same year he was appointed, along with Luis de Pablo, resident at the Musica Festival and the Strasburg Conservatoire. His residence in Rome (first as a scholar of the, then of the Villa Medici French Academy in Rome) allowed him to carry out a reflection on what composition is and what it means today, focusing mainly on thoughts about intertextuality and the saturation, silence and experience of sound and time, all of which giving birth to emblematic pieces such as Ilunkor (commissioned by the Euskadiko Orkestra Sinfonikoa) and Lur-Itzalak (commissioned by the Printemps des Arts of Monte Carlo). His works have been played in many countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Israel, Spain, Italy, Ukraine, Denmark, United Kingdom, Russia, USA, Austria, and others) in the framework of prestigious festivals such as: Musica (Strasbourg), Ars Musica (Brussels), Festival d‚ÄôAutomne (Paris), √âclat (Stuttgart), Witten (Germany), Pr√©sences in Radio-France, Philharmonic Green Umbrella New Music series (Los Angeles), Gaudeamus Muziekweek (Amsterdam), International Society of Contemporary Music (Copenhagen), Festival of Contemporary Music (Alicante, Spain). His music has been played by such renowned orchestras and ensembles as, among others, the Philharmonic Orchestra of Radio France, the Symphony Orchestra of Jerusalem, the National Orchestra of Spain, the Symphony Orchestra of Euskadi, the Symphony Orchestra of Bilbao, the Spanish Broadcast Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestra of the Teatre Lliure of Barcelona, the ensembles Gaudeamus, Ictus and Accroche Note, the Ensemble Barcelona 216, the Conjunto Ib√©rico de Violoncellos, Ensemble Wiener Collage.Repertoire, Ensemble Wiener Collage He has been commissioned by the Ministry of Culture (France), the Basque Government, the CDMC (Spain), Radio France, ABRSM of London, the Orquestra de Cadaqu√©s, the Orquesta de la Comunidad de Madrid, and others.

However, when Lord Curzon visited the railway, he remarked that he considered its significance went beyond local military control and threatened British interests in Asia.Military power, conflict, and trade by Michael P. Gerace, Routledge, 2004 p182 History =Construction= Route of Trans-Caspian railway in Turkmenistan Route of Trans-Caspian railway in Uzbekistan Uzun-Ada port and railway station Construction began in 1879 of a narrow-gauge railway to Gyzylarbat in connection with the Russian conquest of Transcaspia under General Mikhail Skobelev. It was rapidly altered to the standard Russian gauge of five feet, and construction through to Ashkabad and Merv (modern Mary) was completed under General Michael Nicolaivitch Annenkoff in 1886. Originally the line began from Uzun-Ada on the Caspian Sea, but the terminus was later shifted north to the harbour at Krasnovodsk. The Railway reached Samarkand via Bukhara in 1888, where it halted for ten years until extended to Tashkent and Andijan in 1898. The permanent bridge over the Oxus (Amu-Darya) was not completed until 1901, and until then trains ran over a rickety wooden construction that was often damaged by floods. As early as 1905, there was a train ferry across the Caspian Sea from Krasnovodsk to Baku in Azerbaijan. The Tashkent Railway connecting the Transcaspian Military Railway with the network of other Russian and European railways was completed in 1906. Economic Impact The railway permitted a massive increase in the amount of cotton exported from the region. This increased from 873,092 pudy in 1888 to 3,588,025 in 1893. Also sugar, kerosene, wood, iron and construction material were imported into the area. These rising trade figures were used by Governor-General Nikolai Rozenbakh to argue for the extension to Tashkent, while the merchant N. I. Reshetnikov offered private funds for the same purpose.Russian Colonial Society in Tashkent by Jeff Sahadeo, Indiana University Press, 2007, p120 =Revolution and Civil War= The railway was the most important means of communication in the area, and the workers on the railway became key activists during the Russian revolution. It was thirty five railway workers who founded the Tashkent Soviet on 2 March 1917.Russian colonial Society in Tashkent, 1865-1923, by Jeff Sahedeo, Indiana university Press, 2007, p. 190 They decreed that the administration of the railway should be transferred away from Ashkhabad and sent Commissar Frolov to that city, a move that proved unpopular.The Times, The Fighting In Trans-Caspia, 3 March 1919 In turn railway workers along the western end of the railway initiated a break away from the Bolshevik oriented Tashkent, setting up the Ashkhabad Executive Committee on 14 July 1918. Both railway and workers also played an important role in the Russian Civil War. Troops of the British Indian Army participated in some of the battles along the railway line. Tashkent was an important bastion for the Red Army.On Secret Service East of Constantinople, by Peter Hopkirk, John Murray 1994 =Under the Soviet Union= During the Soviet period and beyond, the railway was administrated from Tashkent. Route Bereket city is an important junction on the Trans-Caspian route. The railway starts at the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea at Turkmenbashi (Krasnovodsk) and heads southeast, along the edge of the Karakum Desert. The important junction on the route and locomotive repair depot is located in Bereket city (formerly Gazandjyk) some to the east. Also at this point the Trans-Caspian railway intersects the newly constructed North-South Transnational Railway which connects Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran and ends at Persian Gulf. After Bereket, the route runs parallel to the Karakum Canal. It passes through Ashgabat (Ashkhabad) and continues southeast, hugging the foothills of the Kopet Dagh mountains, and passing through Tedzhen. At Tedzhen, a modern railway link branches off, heading to the Iranian border at Serakhs, and thence to Mashhad in Iran. From Tedzhen, the Trans-Caspian heads northeast, through Mary (Merv), where a branch line built in the 1890s leads to the Afghan border at Gushgy, and the main line carries on to Turkmenabat (Ch√§rjew). From there, a branch built in the Soviet period connects northwestward to Urganch and on to Kazakhstan and Russia. The main line continues from Turkmenabat through Bukhoro (where a branch line built in 1910 leads to Termez and Dushanbe) and then carries on to Samarqand. At Sirdaryo, where it crosses the Syr Darya river, a branch runs east into the fertile Fergana Valley. From there, the railway continues to Tashkent. There another northwest bound line runs to Kazakhstan, which branches at Arys forming the Turkestan-Siberia Railway to Novosibirsk.

It was the first complete philosophical exposition for separating the beautiful and the sublime into their own respective rational categories. It attracted the attention of prominent thinkers such as Denis Diderot and Immanuel Kant. Summary According to Burke, the Beautiful is that which is well-formed and aesthetically pleasing, whereas the Sublime is that which has the power to compel and destroy us. The preference for the Sublime over the Beautiful was to mark the transition from the Neoclassical to the Romantic era. The origins of our ideas of the beautiful and the sublime, for Burke, can be understood by means of their causal structures. According to Aristotelian physics and metaphysics, causation can be divided into formal, material, efficient and final causes. The formal cause of beauty is the passion of love; the material cause concerns aspects of certain objects such as smallness, smoothness, delicacy, etc.; the efficient cause is the calming of our nerves; the final cause is God's providence. What is most peculiar and original to Burke's view of beauty is that it cannot be understood by the traditional bases of beauty: proportion, fitness, or perfection. The sublime also has a causal structure that is unlike that of beauty. Its formal cause is thus the passion of fear (especially the fear of death); the material cause is equally aspects of certain objects such as vastness, infinity, magnificence, etc.; its efficient cause is the tension of our nerves; the final cause is God having created and battled Satan, as expressed in John Milton's great epic Paradise Lost. Kant's comments Immanuel Kant critiqued Burke for not understanding the causes of the mental effects that occur in the experience of the beautiful or the sublime. According to Kant, Burke merely gathered data so that some future thinker could explain them. :\\"To make psychological observations, as Burke did in his treatise on the beautiful and the sublime, thus to assemble material for the systematic connection of empirical rules in the future without aiming to understand them, is probably the sole true duty of empirical psychology, which can hardly even aspire to rank as a philosophical science.\\" - Immanuel Kant, First Introduction to the Critique of Judgment, X.Kant, Immanuel, First Introduction to the Critique of Judgment, Library of Liberal Arts, 146, Bobbs- Merril Co., 1965 Notes References * Vermeir, Koen and Funk Deckard, Michael (eds.)

It is categorized as a regional environmentally sensitive area, an Ontario Area of Natural and Scientific Interest, and part of the Niagara Escarpment world biosphere reserve. The conservation area contains Crawford Lake, a reconstructed Iroquoian village, and several hiking trails. A study conducted in 1971 determined that the lake is meromictic, which makes the lake a prime site for archaeological and geochemical studies. Using pollen analysis, reconstruction of the history of the area over several hundred years was possible. Geochemical analysis of sediment cores has allowed for the reconstruction of the pollution history of the area. This analysis revealed the trends and sources of air pollution over approximately 150 years. The pollen analysis revealed corn pollen, indicating a possible Iroquoian settlement nearby, as corn was a staple of their agriculture. A search of the surrounding area found a grindstone, which would have been used in such a village. Digs of the area just south of the grindstone revealed the foundations of an eleven-longhouse village. The village, thought to be inhabited by either the Wendat (Huron) or Neutral Confederacy peoples, has been reconstructed in the conservation area and is based on many years of research by archaeologists, who continue to study the site. The reconstructed fifteenth century Iroquoian village is open seasonally and for special events. The site offers interpretive programs of Iroquoian life and culture and has three reconstructed longhouses and a palisade, although the original village did not have a palisade. One longhouse is used to display contemporary indigenous art and artifacts recovered from past digs. The longhouses are representative of life in the village at the time, with fireplaces, fur-lined bunk beds, and various items used at the time.

The Crawford family also owned a cedar tree farm on the opposite side of the lake. The conservation area also has of hiking and cross-country skiing and snowshoeing trails with connections to Bruce Trail.

The series was another police drama from Crawford Productions, but was different from their previous series‚ÄîHomicide, Division 4 and Matlock Police‚Äîin that it focused on a single detective rather than an ensemble, and that the characters were not stock standard archetypes usually seen in police dramas. Stand-up comedian Lucky Grills was cast as the titular Det. Sgt. \\"Bluey\\" Hills who, in contrast to the relatively straight detectives seen in Crawford's previous shows, was obese, drank heavily (even on duty), smoked heavily, visited local prostitutes, and would often enact physical violence to criminals. Overview Bluey was set at Melbourne's Russell Street Police Headquarters, with \\"Bluey\\" Hills heading his own squad (\\"Department B\\"), due to his inability to work within the existing police squads. Department B was given cases that the other departments could not readily solve by conventional means, with Hills applying his unconventional methods to bring about their resolution. Bluey was supported in his investigations by newly assigned Det. Gary Dawson (John Diedrich) long-time cohort Sgt. Monica Rourke (Gerda Nicolson), and undercover officer Det. Sgt. Reg Truscott (Terry Gill), who spent his time ostensibly working as a small- time burglar, and supplying Bluey with information on the activities of local criminals. Victoria Quilter also featured in early episodes as Dawson's girlfriend Jo Goldman, later replaced by Mercia Deane-Johns as Debbie Morley. Whilst a constant thorn in the side of the Assistant Commissioner (Ken Goodlet) and Superintendent (Fred Parslow), Bluey's methods were highly effective‚Äîwhile other squads didn't want him as a part of their team, they still sought him out when they couldn't get the job done. Unlike other Australian TV series where it was common practice to shoot interior scenes on 2.5 cm quadruplex videotape and outdoor shots on film, the series was entirely shot on colour film. The final episode, \\"Son of Bluey\\", featured an appearance by actor Don Barker as Det. Sgt. Harry White‚Äîthe same character he played in Homicide.

Although the show only lasted for one year, Bluey found a new audience almost two decades later when dubbed clips from the show formed the basis for the popular The Late Show comedy sketch \\"Bargearse\\". In addition to two other guest appearances as himself, Grills also reprised his role as Bluey on The Late Show in order to protest the airing of the last Bargearse sketch.

History  Air Viet Nam plane and passengers, 1961 Douglas C-54D, in 1975 Caravelle Groves, in 1962 Boeing 727-100, in 1971 Boeing 707-300, in 1974 Air Viet Nam's initial fleet consisted of five Cessna 170s, Douglas DC-3s and Douglas DC-4s with the airline flying mainly between cities and towns throughout Vietnam. By 1975, Air Viet Nam was using a fleet of Boeing aircraft, some leased from Pan Am and China Airlines consisting of a number of Boeing 707s and Boeing 727s on both regional and international routes. As passenger traffic increased with the start of the Vietnam War, Air Viet Nam added aircraft, initially Viscounts, DC-3s, and DC-4s. It eventually obtained more modern aircraft, including Boeing 727s, some of which were obtained from Air France and Pan Am. At least one C-46 was leased from China Airlines, and was flown by a Taiwanese crew. That aircraft had a color scheme different from the rest of the Air Viet Nam fleet. In an unusual joint venture, Air Viet Nam was joined by Continental Air Services (CASI), a subsidiary airline of Continental Airlines set up to provide operations and airlift support in Southeast Asia, in the mid-1960s. Under this agreement, CASI would share passengers and cargo routes with Air Viet Nam on certain domestic and international routes. In addition, CASI and Air Viet Nam would share hangars and flight lines. CASI also picked up a portion of aircraft maintenance. Heavy engine overhaul was done in Hong Kong, by China Airlines, and some in Taiwan, by Air Asia (a subsidiary of Air America). CASI paid a portion of its revenues to Air Viet Nam for the routes and privileges. Many CASI aircraft operating from Saigon carried the dragon/flag roundel of Air Viet Nam. In 1972, Air Vietnam had one B747-200 leased from Air France and another B747-100 leased from Pan Am both of which were flown back to their owners within a few weeks of Fall of Saigon. = Fall of Saigon = During the Fall of Saigon and the impending invasion of North Vietnam into South Vietnam, Air Viet Nam decided to assist and help all South Vietnamese citizens to escape to neighboring countries. Many of their pilots and crew worked long hours ferrying South Vietnamese citizens to Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian countries to escape the invading North Vietnamese army. One Boeing 707 flew to Taipei for the use of former President Nguyen Van Thieu and his wife, and close aides had been flown into exile on a CIA C-118 transport. Thieu was extended the courtesy once in exile of the Boeing jet as he went from first Taiwan, then United Kingdom, before finally flying onto the United States of America where it was returned to Pan Am from which it had been leased.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-2001-oct-01-me-52050-story.html One Air Vietnam Boeing 727 was returned to Vietnam from Hong Kong in early June 1975, by lead pilot Huynh Minh Boong, who had married General Pham Hung's sister. Captain Huynh Minh Boong with over 10,000 flight hours, was a pilot on Vietnam Airlines overseas flights due to his IATA credentials, then in early 1980 he was appointed as head of training of Vietnam Airlines, now retired and lives in Ho Chi Minh City. The only commercial jet airplanes transferred from Air Vietnam to Vietnam Airlines are: one (1) Boeing 707 and one (1) Boeing 727-100.

However, one American CASI pilot reported that the Taiwanese crew of the leased C-46 always parked its aircraft separately at T√¢n S∆°n Nh·∫•t International Airport in Saigon and kept its distance from the regular Air Viet Nam and CASI crews. =Uniforms= Pilots for Air Viet Nam wore a distinctive gold/bronze wing with a center shield containing a colored enamel version of the dragon/flag. It can be presumed that some senior grades of pilot and crew existed, although how these were indicated is not clear. Stewardesses, or flight attendants, wore a gold or bronze metal wing with embossed/relief dragon/flag roundel. Uniforms consisted of the traditional √Åo d√†is in a variety of colors. Aircraft livery Air Vietnam aircraft generally had a single or dual green stripe down the main fuselage. The top fuselage was generally white with a natural metal (silver) lower. The colorful dragon/flag roundel appeared in various sizes, most often on the tail rudder. Sometimes the roundel would appear alone and occasionally with a dual green stripe. The wording \\"Air Viet Nam\\" appeared in red/orange lettering above the windows on all large aircraft except the 727s, which were marked \\"Hang Kh√¥ng Viet Nam\\". Exceptions to these schemes included the early Viscount aircraft, which were all white with a green stripe and had the roundel appearing on the front fuselage. The Chinese C-46 aircraft had a blue and red nose-side stripe with the roundel appearing on the rudder. Marketing Advertisements used from the mid-1960s included South Vietnamese Olympians, such as Thach Thi Ngoc, and flamboyant military officer Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥, whose wife Madame Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ was a flight stewardess before they were married. These celebrities promoted the airline's operation of Viscounts on the \\"Green Dragon Route\\", alternating flights from Saigon to Siem Reap, Cambodia; Bangkok, Thailand; and Hong Kong. Timetables indicate domestic routes covering destinations as far north as Hu·∫ø, as far south as C√† Mau, and including almost every major city in between. Incidents and accidents ;16 August 1954: Bristol Freighter 21E F-VNAI crashed into the Mekong River while on approach to Pakse for an emergency landing due to engine problems, killing 47 of 55 on board. The aircraft was operating a flight from Hanoi to Tan Son Nhut International Airport. ;10 November 1962: Douglas C-47B XV-NID crashed into a mountain northwest of Da Nang Airport due to a navigation error in bad weather, killing all 27 on board. The aircraft was operating on a flight route from Phu Bai Airport to Da Nang Airport. ;1962: Douglas C-54B XV-NUA was reportedly written off at an unknown location. ;16 September 1965: Douglas C-47A XV-NIC was shot down by Communist ground fire shortly after takeoff and crashed northeast of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i, killing all 39 on board; one passenger survived, but died a few hours later. ;2 April 1969: Douglas DC-6B XV-NUC was destroyed on the ground at Hue-Citadel Airfield during a Communist attack. ;1 May 1969: Douglas C-54B F-BELL burned out on the ground while parked at Saigon Airport. ;20 September 1969: Douglas C-54D XV-NUG collided with US Air Force McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II 67-0393 and crashed into a field near Da Nang, killing 74 of 75 on board and two people working in the field; the Phantom was able to land safely. The C-54 was operating on a flight route from Saigon to Pleiku Airport to Da Nang Airport. When the pilot of the Phantom was cleared to land on Runway 17R by ATC, the pilot of the C-54, cleared to land on Runway 17L, thought that the message was addressed to his aircraft and turned right for approach to Runway 17R. This brought the C-54 in the path of the Phantom and the two aircraft collided. ;22 December 1969: Douglas DC-6B B-2005 suffered an explosion and hydraulic failure while descending for Nha Trang Airport. After a low level pass to check the landing gear, a nose-high flapless approach was made. The aircraft touched down, but became airborne again after application of reverse thrust. The throttles were closed and the aircraft landed again, but overran the runway, struck a concrete pylon and caught fire, killing 10 of 77 on board and 24 on the ground. A bomb placed in the front left lavatory detonated during approach. ;22 July 1970: A U.S. Army private, George M. Hardin, hijacked a DC-4 en route from Pleiku to Saigon. Hardin allowed the 65 passengers aboard to disembark from the plane before moving to the cockpit and threatening the pilot with a small knife. He was detained in Saigon after attempting to force the pilot, Floyd R. Derieux, to take him to Hong Kong, but the pilot told him the DC-4 could not carry enough fuel to make the trip. There were no fatalities. ;30 September 1970: Douglas DC-3DST-318A B-305 crashed into a hill in the Hai Van Mountains at near Da Nang while attempting to divert to Da Nang Airport due to weather conditions at its intended destination of Phu Bai Airport, Hu·∫ø. Three of the 38 people on board were killed. ;1 November 1970: Curtiss C-46 B-1543 force-landed on a beach at Quy Nh∆°n due to fuel system problems; the aircraft sank in sand and flooded out at high tide. The aircraft was operating on a flight from Saigon to Quang Ngai. ;22 August 1971: Douglas DC-3A-375 B-304 was written off at Kampot Airport. ;24 September 1972: Douglas C-54D XV-NUH crashed into a marshy area 23 miles from Saigon, killing 10 of 13 on board. The aircraft was operating a flight from Vientiane Airport to Tan Son Nhat International Airport. ;19 March 1973: Douglas C-54D XV-NUI crashed 4.1 mi S of Buon Ma Thuot Airport after an explosion in the cargo hold near the wing spar, killing all 58 on board. The aircraft was operating a flight from Tan Son Nhat International Airport to Buon Ma Thuot Airport. ;5 September 1973: Boeing 727-121C XV-NJC suffered an explosion in the galley at 15 minutes after takeoff from Bangkok, injuring two passengers and a stewardess; the aircraft was able to return and land safely at Bangkok. Although it was thought that a bomb exploded, a Royal Thai Air Force investigation concluded that a defective broiler in the galley caused the explosion. Although the aircraft was repaired and returned to service, it was written off following the hijacking and crash of Flight 706 in 1974. ;17 November 1973: Douglas C-47B XV-NIE struck a mountain at NNW of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i killing all 27 people on board. The crew had gotten lost and flew too low in a mountainous area while attempting to reach Chu Lai, near the crash site. The aircraft was operating a domestic scheduled passenger flight from Tan Son Nhat International Airport to Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Airport. ;20 February 1974: Douglas C-54A XV-NUM was hijacked en route from Quy Nh∆°n to Da Nang. The hijacker was a 19-year-old South Vietnamese man demanding to go to Dong Hoi, North Vietnam. When the aircraft landed at Hu·∫ø, the hijacker realized he had been tricked and detonated a grenade, killing himself and two police officers. The explosion also blew a 2 x 3 m hole in the port side of the fuselage and broke three starboard side windows. The aircraft was written off. ;15 September 1974: Flight 706 - Le Duc Tan, a ranger in the South Vietnamese army who had recently been demoted from captain to lieutenant for the theft of two cars in Da Nang, smooth-talked his way past security checkpoints and hijacked the Boeing 727 en route from Da Nang to Saigon, demanding to go to Hanoi. He detonated two hand grenades, and the aircraft crashed at Phan Rang when it overshot the runway on an attempted landing. All 75 persons on board, including 67 passengers and eight crew members, were killed. ;12 March 1975: Douglas C-54D XV-NUJ crashed 16 mi from Pleiku, killing all 26 on board; the wreckage was not examined due to hostile conditions in the area. The aircraft, operating a flight from Vientiane to Saigon, was probably shot down by a missile.

It consists of a hard plastic shell with thick padding on the inside, a face mask made of one or more plastic-coated metal bars, and a chinstrap. Each position has a different type of face mask to balance protection and visibility, and some players add polycarbonate visors to their helmets, which are used to protect their eyes from glare and impacts. Helmets are a requirement at all levels of organized football, except for non-tackle variations such as flag football. Although they are protective, players can and do still suffer head injuries such as concussions. Football helmets have changed dramatically with the modernization of the sport to facilitate technological changes and to improve the safety of the game. Despite lower rates of some injuries, serious traumas to the head are still common, and determining the consequences of these traumas is an active area of research. In addition to the acute concern about traumatic brain injuries, such as concussions, studies have found players increase their risk for long-term problems such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Football helmets present a unique design challenge because, unlike bicycle helmets, which are thrown out after a single hit, football helmets need to withstand multiple impacts. History Football team, turn of the 20th century =Invention= One of the first instances of football headgear dates to 1896 when Lafayette College halfback George \\"Rose\\" Barclay began to use straps and earpieces to protect his ears. It is not certain who invented the football helmet. Many sources give credit for the creation of the helmet to James Naismith, while other sources credit U.S. Naval Academy Midshipman Joseph M. Reeves (later to become the \\"Father of Carrier Aviation\\"), who had a protective device for his head made out of mole skin to allow him to play in the 1893 Army‚ÄìNavy game. Reeves had been advised by a Navy doctor that another kick to his head would result in \\"instant insanity\\" or even death, so he commissioned an Annapolis shoemaker to make him a helmet out of leather. Later, helmets were made of padded leather and resembled aviators' helmets or modern day scrum caps. At least in professional football, they were optional. Some National Football League players, notably Hall-of-Famer Bill Hewitt, played all or most of their careers without a helmet. =Early years= One innovation from the early 1900s period was hardened leather. 1917 marked the first time helmets were raised above the head in an attempt to direct blows away from the top of the head. Ear flaps also had their downfall during this period as they had little ventilation and made it difficult for players to hear. The 1920s marked the first time that helmets were widely used in the sport of football. These helmets were made of leather and had some padding on the inside, but the padding was insufficient and provided little protection. In addition, they lacked face masks. As a result, injuries were very common. Early helmets also absorbed a lot of heat, making them very uncomfortable to wear. A leather football helmet believed to have been worn by Gerald Ford while playing for the University of Michigan between 1932 and 1934. In 1939, the Riddell Company of Chicago, Illinois started manufacturing plastic helmets because it felt that plastic helmets would be safer than those made of leather. Plastic was found to be more effective because it held its shape when full collision contact occurred on a play. These helmets were also much more comfortable and had more padding to cushion the head in an impact. Included with the plastic helmet came plastic face mask, which allowed the helmet to protect the entire head. By the mid-1940s, helmets were required in the NFL. They were still made of leather, but with improved manufacturing techniques had assumed their more familiar spherical shape. The NFL initially allowed either plastic or leather helmets, but in 1948 the league outlawed the plastic helmet, considering the hard- plastic material to be an injury risk. The NFL lifted the plastic helmet ban after just one year in 1949, and by 1950, the plastic helmet had become universal in that league. =Introduction of advanced materials= By the 1950s, the introduction of polymers ended the leather helmet era. The last leather helmet manufacturer, MacGregor, ceased production of leather helmets in the mid-1960s. The NFL also recommended face masks for players in 1955,Factory Made television program, segment entitled \\"Football helmets\\", Science Channel. reducing the number of broken noses and teeth, but also necessitating new rules prohibiting opposing players from grabbing the face mask. By varying accounts, either Pat Studstill or Garo Yepremian was the last to forgo the facemask; among non-kickers, Tommy McDonald was the last to do so. = Recent designs = In 2002, American football equipment manufacturer Riddell released a new design of helmet called the Revolution in response to a study concussions.Riddell: Product Detail In addition, Riddell has recently come out with a new design of helmets, the Riddell Speed Flex. This helmet came out in 2014. This new helmet uses elements of Riddell's older helmets, the 360 and the Revolution, such as Side Impact Protection and All Points Quick Release face mask attachment system.214x214px Demand for a safer helmet prompted Schutt Sports to announce the arrival of a next generation helmet, the ION 4D, which included an integrated face guard. This new face guard design features shock absorbing \\"Energy Wedges\\" that reduce the force of impacts to the face guard. College teams wearing the helmet include Air Force, Penn State and Virginia. Schutt has also distinguished between their varsity helmets and youth helmets. The varsity helmets from Schutt are made with polycarbonate, which is a very strong polymer designed to take bigger hits. The Schutt youth helmets however; are made from ABS, which is a lighter material, meant for kids who do not take as powerful of hits. Recently, a brand new type of helmet has come into play. Vicis is a new company that is producing helmets that have a softer outer layer. The softer layer absorbs more energy from impacts. In addition, the inside of the helmet also has a foam like substance which absorbs energy and improves comfort. Modern helmet components = Outer shell = The outer shell of helmets have changed appreciably throughout the history of the NFL. In the 1920s, football helmets had soft leather exteriors, whereas today they have polycarbonate exteriors. The first molded polycarbonate helmet appeared in the NFL in 1986. Today's helmets typically have polycarbonate shells on the order of 3.35 mm. The hard outer shell protects the head from local impacts by delocalizing the force, so the load can be absorbed by the other elements. Polycarbonates are ideal materials for outer shells because they are lightweight, tough and exhibit good impact strength, even in extreme temperatures. Polycarbonates refer to a family of thermoset polymers that are wIdely used in manufacturing, for their mechanical performance and ease in manufacturing. The aesthetic design of the outer shell has become central to teams' uniform and image. = Energy absorbing elements = The performance of a football helmet is based on its ability to decrease the force to the head from an impact. A helmet reduces the peak force transferred to the head by temporarily storing or dissipating impact energy. The primary energy absorbing elements are the compression shock and shock bonnets, while the secondary elements are comfort pads. The materials used to build these components and their dimensions vary within the helmet. The design takes account of a player‚Äôs comfort and specific position, as well as the goal of protecting the most sensitive regions of the head and areas where big hits are most common. Because football helmets need to withstand multiple collisions, the helmet materials need to return to their original form after each hit. Padding materials need to be low density to make the helmet comfortable and practical without sacrificing energy absorption. Most football helmets are made from polyurethane or nitrile foams, because they keep the force peak under the load recommended for head health (1.5MPa) without deforming, while being relatively lightweight and easy to manufacture. Engineering Stress-Strain diagram of a viscoelastic material. (A)-(B): elastic, (C) plateau, (D)-(E) densification In order to understand why these polyurethane or nitrile foams are ideal for football helmets, it is helpful to review the properties of these materials. They can all be broadly categorized as viscoelastic foams. When a stress is applied to these types of materials, there are three main regions of deformation: linear elastic, plateau and densification. In the linear elastic region a material deforms reversibly in proportion to its young‚Äôs modulus, or stiffness. In the plateau region the foam begins to collapse, and this is also a type of recoverable deformation. When the material reaches its densification region it begins to change its internal structure permanently and cannot return to its original shape. Because football helmets are used repeatedly, they needed to be designed, so the strain stays in the elastic or plateau region. The area under the curve in stress strain curve (shown in the figure to the right) represents the energy absorbed. Foams should be strained a precise amount, so they absorb energy without permanent densification. In viscoelastic materials, the elastic region changes its shape depending on the strain rate, meaning the speed at which the material is deformed, or more practically, the velocity of the hit. In general, when the material is strained more quickly it is stiffer, so it deforms less. The degree of protection provided by the helmet depends on the velocity of the hit, and performance is poor for the fastest and slowest hits. Air pockets, while absorbing some energy themselves, also help the helmets perform better in very high and low velocity hits. Air chambers have venting systems so the volume and geometry of air chambers is dynamic, helping dampen the viscoelastic effect. The inside of a football helmet The inception for air pockets came from Vin Ferrara,Shwartz, Alan. 'Helmet Design Absorbs Shock in a New Way' The New York Times. 2007 https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/27/sports/football/27helmets.html a former Harvard quarterback. One night, Ferrara was looking for an aspirin when he saw a squirt bottle in his medicine cabinet. As he pumped it and then punched it, he realized that the bottle withstood the blows of different forces. Ferrara came up with the idea to encase football helmets with a number of inflatable pockets in order to cushion the blows a football player receives and reduce concussions. The foams in football helmets break down over time, and this process is often overlooked in safety modeling. Especially for youth teams, helmets are reused over the course of many years, putting players at risk since they are less protected than otherwise anticipated. =Visors= A more recent addition to the football helmet is the visor or eye shield, which is affixed to the face mask to protect players from glare or eye injuries, such as pokes. It is believed that the first player to use a protective visor was Mark Mullaney of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings in 1984, in order to protect a healing eye injury. Top manufacturers of visors are Nike, Oakley, Under Armour and SHOC, with Leader being the first to come out with a visor/shield for former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon (who needed the visor because of a childhood eye injury). While Mullaney and McMahon's visors were tinted, most of the earlier visors were clear or smoked, but they are now offered in a variety of styles ranging from blue, gold, black, rainbow, silver, or amber. High-school and pee-wee leagues prohibit all but clear visors. This rule was enacted so that training staff and coaches can easily view a player's face and eyes in the case of a serious injury, to discern if the player is conscious. The NCAA banned the use of tinted visors for the same reason, and the NFL has followed suit as well. However, players with eye problems may still obtain special permission to wear tinted visors, some notable examples being LaDainian Tomlinson and Chris Canty.Keep On Tickin' Posted 2006-08-25: The NCAA hopes its new rules shorten games this season. The XFL allows players to wear tinted and decorated visors. United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs wearing football helmets during a drill in 2004 =Sensors= Helmet shock data loggers and shock detectors monitor impacts a player receives, such as the force and direction of the impact. If the force recorded by the sensors is over 100 Gs, it signals a possible concussion.University of Denver. \\"Most concussions deliver 95 g's, neuropsychologist says.\\" ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 25 June 2010. . Some players will experience up to 2,000 of these potential concussion blows each season. This data is then analyzed by doctors. Recently some companies have released helmets with sensors that send alerts when a player might have experienced a serious impact. The goal is to be able to detect concussions as soon as they happen to get players immediate medical care. Controversy has surrounded the use of sensors in the NFL. While almost everyone agrees the intentions are laudable, there are concerns about the quality of the data and about privacy of personal health records. During the 2013 season, two unnamed NFL teams tested accelerometers, but their use was suspended after the trial. The league hopes to reintroduce the sensors once the questions of privacy and data quality are addressed. Nonetheless, sensors have already been used to improve the safety of the game. Using data that he collected during a pilot study, Kevin Guskiewicz showed that kickoff returns are the most dangerous part of the game. His results were compelling enough to convince the NFL to move the kickoff line five yards forward to the 35-yard-line, with the intention of increasing the number of touchbacks, a safer play. =Headsets= Two Ohio inventors, John Campbell and George Sarles, devised a headset for Cleveland Browns coach Paul Brown so he could radio plays to quarterback George Ratterman. It was banned shortly after its first use in 1956 (after the Browns had played three preseason games with the radio). The NFL approved use of headsets for all NFL teams in 1994. NFL rules state that all helmets equipped with headsets must have a visible green dot on the back. A few times in 2006, the holder on the field goal attempt was told to pull up and throw or run at the last second because of a change the coaches saw on the field. According to the NFL, this gave teams an \\"unfair advantage\\". The new rules let each team know who is wearing a headset and hearing the plays being called. = Face masks = 2015 Cleveland Browns helmetThe one-bar face mask was once common but its use has been supplanted in professional and amateur sport. For example, it has been illegal in the National Football League since 2004, but a grandfather clause allowed players who wore the mask prior to 2004 to continue to do so for the remainder of their careers. No current professional player currently wears such a face mask; the last player to do so was Scott Player, who last played professionally in 2009. Typically, by the mid-1980s only placekickers and punters in professional football in Canada and the United States wore the one-bar face mask, a notable exception being quarterback Joe Theismann. The one-bar had two different variations. The standard one-bar was made from nylon or other hard plastic and was bolted to both side of the helmet just in front of the earholes. There was a \\"snub\\" version that did not extend as far out in front of the helmet as the standard. Face masks for football helmets today are multibar, having at minimum two bars. The multibar facemasks are typically constructed out of metal, such as titanium, stainless steel, or most commonly carbon steel. Each facemask is coated with Polyarmor G17, a powder coating that is resistant to impact and corrosion. The Polyarmor is a thermoplastic coating used on a number of surfaces. While some organizations purchase new face masks every season, others have their equipment reconditioned.  Regulations =NOCSAE certification= Rules in place for NFL, NCAA, and high school football require that all helmets be certified by the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment. Reliance on NOCSAE certification has been criticized on numerous grounds, including that organization's control by equipment manufacturers causes a conflict of interest, testing data that focuses on skull fractures instead of concussions, and failure to take into account new research. The most common NOCSAE test is the drop test (developed 1973). This test uses a 13-pound dummy head full of sensors and a gelatin material. The head and helmet is dropped from a height of 60 at one of the six NOCSAE specified locations on the helmet. These locations include the front, rear, left side, right side, right boss, and left boss. The sensors in the dummy head measure the amount of force that the head experiences. The NOCSAE has certain regulations such as the peak severity index can never more than 1200 SI. If a helmet fails to meet these requirements, they do not pass the NOCSAE drop test.http://www.nj.com/rutgersfootball/index.ssf/2017/04/behind_the_scenes_look_at_how_a_rutgers_nfl_or_hig.html  Current research  =Safety research= There has been significant study/research regarding head injuries in football, as well as football helmet design in recent years. Kevin Guskiewicz, a professor at The University of North Carolina and a MacArthur Fellow, has for many years been researching concussions in football of all age groups.http://www.unc.edu/spotlight/Guskiewicz-wins-MacArthur He has been equipping UNC football helmets with accelerometers to measure impacts and concussions. Also, the NFL has awarded over $1.6 million in sports medical research, almost $1 million of which has been toward concussion prevention. All this concussion prevention research has led football helmet manufacturers to develop safer products. A joint effort between Virginia Tech and Wake Forest has been testing current football helmets and giving them yearly ratings since 2011. On a scale out of 5 stars, only one helmet was awarded a 5 in 2011. In 2012, two additional helmet designs were awarded 5 stars. Some researchers have found the counterintuitive result that wearing helmets actually increases the chance of injury, and thus they recommend players occasionally practice without helmets. When hard shells were first introduced, the number of head injuries actually increased because players had a false sense of security and made more dangerous tackles. University of New Hampshire participate in a study in which some players practiced twice a week without helmets. By the end of the season, those that were practicing twice a week without a helmet hit their heads 30% less. This research suggests that modernizing the best practices of the game might have more benefits than improving the materials within the helmet. 328x328px = Materials design = Vijay Gupta, a professor at UCLA, has done research and produced a special polymer that if added as a layer on the inside of football helmets can produce up to a 25% decrease in the g-forces a player would experience. This reduction of forces would produce a similar amount of reduction of the probability of a player suffering a concussion from the same hits. There are also ongoing efforts to improve the selection of energy absorbing materials in football helmets. Some researchers are using computational methods to sort through libraries of known materials. Others are developing entirely new foams or by layering existing foams to create a composite that absorbs energy better. Foams tend to be stiffer at lower temperatures. Researchers are currently looking into ways to minimize the impact of temperature on foam stiffness in order to give players maximal protection in all weather. = Hit simulation = Recent research has begun to assess the tests specifically employed to create the safest football equipment. In 2015, David Camarillo at Stanford conducted a study that suggested football helmet tests did not account for the delay between injury-causing brain movement and stress impact. Neuroscientists at Ohio State University launched baseballs from air cannons at football helmets in order to simulate a kick or blow to the head such as a tackle. It was found that the helmets could withstand 2,500 Newtons or about 562 pounds of force. Design parameters for football helmets have traditionally been based on linear-acceleration models. This mode of impact is more straightforward to study and matches design metrics, such as cadaver skull fracture. Ongoing research is focused on understanding rotational forces on football helmets and how to design for more realistic, non-centrosymmetric forces. Logo display =National Football League= In 1948, the Los Angeles Rams were the first NFL team to put logos on their helmets; the basic \\"ram's horn\\" logo on the helmet has remained mostly the same, except for color, ever since. Through the 2019 NFL season, the Cleveland Browns are the only remaining NFL teams not using any form of a primary logo on its helmets. The Pittsburgh Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). At first, this was a temporary measure because the Steelers weren't sure they would like the look of the logo on an all-gold helmet. They wanted to test them before going all-out. Because of the interest generated by having the logo on only one side of their helmets and also due to the team's new success, the Steelers decided to leave the helmet that way permanently. The Cincinnati Bengals, after using a \\"Bengals\\" wordmark for a helmet logo through the 1980 season, have used a tiger-stripe pattern instead of a logo since 1981.

Life Liu Yu's ancestral home was in Tan County (ÈÉØÁ∏£), Donghai State (Êù±Êµ∑Âúã), which is around present-day Tancheng County, Shandong. His ancestor was Liu Jiang (ÂäâÂΩä; 25‚Äì58 CE), a son and heir apparent of Emperor Guangwu who was deposed in 43 CE and became the Prince of Donghai (Êù±Êµ∑Áéã). His grandfather Liu Jia (ÂäâÂòâ) served as Minister of the Household (ÂÖâÁ•øÂã≥), while his father Liu Shu (ÂäâËàí) served as the Administrator (Â§™ÂÆà) of Danyang Commandery (‰∏πÈôΩÈÉ°). Liu Yu held various appointments in the Han government during the reign of Emperor Ling ( 168‚Äì189), including Chancellor of Ganling State (ÁîòÈôµÂúãÁõ∏), Minister of the Imperial Clan (ÂÆóÊ≠£), Inspector of You Province (ÂπΩÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤) and Grand Commandant (Â§™Â∞â). During his tenure, he gained a strong reputation for good, incorrupt and benevolent governance. Even the ethnic minority tribes (e.g. Wuhuan, Xianbei) in You Province and foreign kingdoms near the Han Empire's northern borders (e.g. Buyeo, Yemaek) so highly respected him that they did not dare to cause trouble in his jurisdiction. In recognition of his efforts, the Han government enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Xiangben (Ë•ÑË≥Å‰æØ). In the 190s, Liu Yu and another warlord Gongsun Zan got into conflict because of opposing views on how to deal with the ethnic minority tribes and foreign kingdoms: Liu Yu adopted a peaceful and pacifist policy towards them, while Gongsun Zan preferred to use armed force to keep them under control. In 193, Liu Yu rallied an army of about 100,000 and prepared to attack Gongsun Zan. He instructed his troops to focus on eliminating Gongsun Zan and keep casualties and damage as low as possible. However, one of his subordinates, Gongsun Ji (ÂÖ¨Â≠´Á¥Ä), betrayed him and told Gongsun Zan about his plan. Due to Liu Yu's approach of minimising casualties and damage, he lost the battle against the more aggressive Gongsun Zan and was forced to retreat to Juyong County (Â±ÖÂ∫∏Á∏£). Gongsun Zan attacked Juyong County, conquered it within three days, captured Liu Yu and brought him as a prisoner to Ji County (ËñäÁ∏£; in the vicinity of present-day Tianjin and Beijing). Around the time, the Han central government had sent an emissary, Duan Xun (ÊÆµË®ì), to bestow additional honours upon Liu Yu and grant him authority to oversee affairs in the four provinces in northern China. Gongsun Zan seized the opportunity to coerce Duan Xun into transferring the titles and honours to him instead. After falsely accusing Liu Yu of plotting treason with Yuan Shao, Gongsun Zan forced Duan Xun to order Liu Yu's execution and bring Liu Yu's head back to the imperial capital Chang'an. Along the way, one of Liu Yu's former subordinates seized Liu Yu's head from Duan Xun and had it buried with the proper funeral rites. As Liu Yu was a highly popular and respected figure in You Province, many people mourned his death. Family Liu Yu's son, Liu He (ÂäâÂíå), served as a Palace Attendant (‰æç‰∏≠). He was captured and held hostage by the warlord Yuan Shu but later escaped to join Yuan Shu's half-brother, the warlord Yuan Shao. With backing from Yuan Shao, he and his father's former subordinates sought revenge against Gongsun Zan. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th- century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, when the Yellow Turban Rebellion breaks out in 184, Liu Yu is then serving as the Governor of You Province. His call for volunteers to assist government forces in suppressing the rebellion is the event which leads to Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei taking the Oath of the Peach Garden and forming their first militia to fight the rebels. This account, however, is historically inaccurate, as Liu Yu did not become the Inspector of You Province until 188.

In 1860 Rimmer made his head of St. Stephen and in 1861 his Falling Gladiator. Rimmer's sculptures, except those mentioned and The Fighting Lions, A Dying Centaur, and a statue of Alexander Hamilton (made in 1865 for the city of Boston), were soon destroyed. He worked in clay, not modelling but building up and chiselling; almost always without models or preliminary sketches; and always under technical disadvantages and in great haste; but his sculpture is anatomically remarkable and has an early Greek simplicity and strength. From 1866 to 1870 he was director of the Cooper Union School of Design for Women in New York City. Among his pupils there was Ella Ferris Pell. Rimmer published Elements of Design (1864) and Art Anatomy (1877), but his great work was in the classroom, where his lectures were illustrated with blackboard sketches.

An early form of clipper, the name is most commonly applied to two-masted schooners and brigantines. These vessels may also be referred to as Baltimore Flyers. History Baltimore clippers were first built as small, fast sailing vessels for trade around the coastlines of the United States and the Caribbean Islands. Their hull-lines tended to be very sharp, with a \\"V\\"-shaped cross- section below the waterline and strongly raked stem, stern posts, and masts. Because of this design, they were extremely unstable and many were known to capsize even at anchor with all sails down.Gardiner 1999 The origins of the type are unknown but certainly hulls conforming to the concept were being built in Jamaica and Bermuda, with the hull of the ocean-going Bermuda sloop broader than the Jamaican and deeper than the American design. By the late 18th century the Baltimore configuration was not only popular in the United States as merchant craft but in Britain as well. The Royal Navy did not find them useful during the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars because they were unstable gun platforms due to their design for extreme speed compared to their size. Furthermore, the schooner rig does not allow sails to be backed creating a disadvantage in maneuverability in battle. They were adopted after the wars to pursue slave ships. Flying Fish class, modeled on an American vessel, sent to Bermudian builders by the Admiralty. They were especially suited to moving low-density, high value perishable cargoes such as slaves, and in that trade operated as far afield as the west coast of Africa. Similar merchant vessels were given letters of marque and served as privateers during the War of Independence. During the War of 1812, merchant schooners were too small and slow to escape the British blockade, and larger faster more heavily armed purpose built privateer Baltimore clippers were developed. The most famous of these larger vessels were the privateers Chasseur, Prince de Neufchatel and General Armstrong. Prince de Neufchatel resisted an attack by a four fold numerically superior force in the boats of HMS Endymion and Chasseur alone captured more enemy ships than the entire US Navy during the war. Nevertheless, most privateers during the war were of the smaller type and served as merchant ships despite being given letters of marque. As a result, more privateers were taken by the British blockade of 1813 than ever took a prize themselves. In addition Baltimore Clippers were used as pilot boats. The famous yacht America, derived from the lines of a New York pilot boat, was conceptually not far removed from the Baltimore clipper. Many such vessels went to Australia during the Australian gold rush, or after being seized as slavers and sold. One particularly famous Baltimore Clipper, and one of the last of the type in commercial service, was the schooner Vigilant that traded around the Danish Caribbean islands for over a century before sinking in a hurricane on September 12, 1928. She was believed to have been built in the 1790s. An original Baltimore Clipper. These were used as privateers during the War of 1812.

Many improvement measures have already been undertaken; some are in the planning stages, and others have been realized. The community lies in the southern Verbandsgemeinde of Wallmerod, a kind of collective municipality. =Amalgamations= Dreikirchen came into being through the amalgamation of the formerly autonomous Ortsgemeinden of P√ºtschbach and Oberhausen. In the course of administrative reform ‚Äì namely the formation of the Verbandsgemeinden in Rhineland-Palatinate ‚Äì the two former communities‚Äô councils came up with the new placename Dreikirchen. The grounds for this choice were the fortress church in the middle of P√ºtschbach, first mentioned in 1292, the chapel in Oberhausen and the parish church serving both places and newly built in 1957, in other words, the ‚Äúthree churches‚Äù (drei Kirchen in German). =Community council= The council is made up of 16 council members who were elected in a majority vote in a municipal election on 7 June 2009. Coat of arms The community's arms symbolize both former communities‚Äô quintessential traditional features as well as Oberhausen's and P√ºtschbach's fusion into the new community of Dreikirchen in April 1969. The silver pale and chevron combination represents the H√§userbach in Oberhausen's municipal area and the former watercourse in P√ºtschbach's municipal area, which symbolically flow together forming a new unity for the united community. Until 1564, Dreikirchen belonged to the Nassau Counts‚Äô domain, after which it passed to the Electorate of Trier. In the 19th century, it belonged to the Duchy of Nassau and thereafter to the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau. Each of these is documented by an heraldic tincture, namely blue for the community's main membership in Nassau, and red for the Electorate of Trier. Here is also found the community's name in the three stylized silver steeples. The middle and predominant tower refers to the fortress church from the 12th century, the one on the left stands for the chapel in Oberhausen, and the one on the right once again symbolizes unity in depicting the parish church, which was meant to serve both former communities. The dexter (ie on the armsbearer's right and therefore the viewer's left) field shows an oak sprig with two acorns representing the centuries-old oak forest in P√ºtschbach and nature in general, while the sinister (ie on the armsbearer's left and therefore the viewer's right) field shows some basalt columns referring to the basalt deposits in Oberhausen and the basalt mining there that goes back generations. Dreikirchen seen coming from Hundsangen in winter Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= P√ºtschbach's fortress church has a tower from the 12th century built in the Gothic style. The rest of the building has its roots in the 13th century. In 1970 the building was renovated. Also worth seeing is a timber- frame farmhouse built about 1700 that was brought back into use as a dwelling after renovation.

Career In 1835, he was elected to Toronto City Council of the year-old city of Toronto and was chosen to be mayor. He added a business- like atmosphere to council with the official 'robes of office'. The Council worked on matters like tax rates, grants and the removal of 'filth and nuisances from the city streets'. On May 6, 1835, Council's Committee on draining and paving approved construction of the city's first main sewer on King Street into which all drains and sewers were to be connected. In 1836, actions by new Lieutenant Governor Francis Bond Head triggered the resignation of the members of the Executive Council for the province. Sullivan accepted an appointment to the council. In the same year, he became the commissioner of crown lands. In 1839, he was appointed surveyor general of the province and became a member of the Legislative Council. Although criticized by many as a turncoat, he was an able administrator. He supported the union of Upper and Lower Canada and was appointed to the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada. He served briefly as the first Commissioner of Crown Lands for the united province February 10, 1841 ‚Äì June 30, 1841. In 1848, he was appointed to the Queen's Bench. Judge Sullivan died April 14, 1853, in Toronto. He was buried on the Baldwin family estate, now the grounds of Spadina House in Toronto. Family Justice Robert Baldwin Sullivan\`s widow, Emily Louisa Hincks by William Notman Baldwin was born in Bandon, County Cork in the Ireland in 1802 and came to York, Upper Canada with his family in 1819. He studied law and was called to the bar in 1828. He moved to Vittoria, then the district town of the London District, and married in 1829, but returned to York after his wife's death in 1830. Sullivan remarried in 1833, marrying Emily Louisa Delatre, daughter of Lieut.-Col. Philip Delatre, 1st Ceylon Regiment, and his second wife, Amey Scolding December 24, 1833. Emily Louisa was born in Ceylon. The couple had four sons and five daughters. Emily Louisa remarried June 14, 1875, as the second wife of the Hon. Sir Francis Hincks, C.B., K.C.M.G., formerly Premier of the Province of Canada and, subsequently, Governor of the Windward Islands and of British Guiana. Lady Hincks died in Montreal May 14, 1880, aged 64. Sir Francis Hincks died in Montreal, August 18, 1885.

The Turkestan‚ÄìSiberian Railway (commonly abbreviated as the Turk‚ÄìSib, , ÿ™Ÿ∑ÿ±ŸÉÿ≥Ÿ∏ÿ®, ; ) is a broad gauge railway that connects Central Asia with Siberia. It starts north of Tashkent in Uzbekistan at Arys, where it branches off from the Trans- Aral Railway. It heads roughly northeast through Shymkent, Taraz, Bishkek (on a spur) to the former Kazakh capital of Almaty. There it turns northward to Semey before crossing the Russian border. It passes through Barnaul before ending at Novosibirsk, where it meets the West Siberian portion of the Trans- Siberian railway. The bulk of construction works was undertaken between 1926 and 1931.  Construction history  The idea of a railway between Siberia and Russian Turkestan was aired as early as 1886, but it was supplanted by that of a more practicable line between Tashkent and Orenburg in the Urals. On 15 October 1896 the Verny town duma set up a commission to examine the feasibility of building a Turkestan‚ÄìSiberia Railway. It was expected that the line would facilitate transport of cotton from Turkestan to Siberia and cheap Siberian grain from Russia to the Fergana Valley. An eastern branch would enhance Russia's military and economic presence on the Chinese border. In 1906 the Russian imperial government decided to finance construction of the first section, between Barnaul and Arys. A team of Russian engineers made a detailed survey of the steppe and semi-desert regions the railway was expected to cross. On 21 October 1915 the northern section linking Novosibirsk and Semipalatinsk as the Altai Railway. The missing Arys‚ÄìPishpek‚ÄìTokmak section, officially known as Semipalatinsk Railway, was left to be built by a French- financed Russian-managed private railway consortium. World War I put an end of this project. After the Bolshevik Revolution construction work was suspended for a decade, and the long Semipalatinsk‚ÄìAyaguz line, built in 1918‚Äì19 by the White Russians on the initiative of Admiral Kolchak, was demolished for no apparent reason. The remaining of railway were constructed with great fanfare as part of the first five-year plan between 1928 and 1932. Regular passenger service was finally established between Semipalatinsk and Ayaguz on 10 May 1929. The Turksib was completed on 21 April 1930. The locomotive which pioneered the route going from Tashkent to Semipalatinsk (–≠-1441(rus)) later became a part of a memorial in Alma-Ata. Viktor Alexandrovitsh Turin directed a 1929 Soviet documentary film on the building of the railway which also bore the name Turksib.  Connectivity  Years after the Turksib was completed, it was joined at Shu by Kazakhstan's main north-south line, which serves Karaganda, Nur-Sultan and Petropavlovsk, on one of the main Transsib routes. In 1990, Aktogay station, roughly midway between Alma-Ata and Semipalatinsk, became an important junction. Lines from there run east, connecting at Dostyk with China's Lanxin railway Line (toward Urumqi, Lanzhou, and heartland China); and west, to Balkhash and Karaganda.

His colleague was Curtis Reid. He also umpired in the second Test match, played two weeks later in Melbourne, partnered by Sam Cosstick. Ben Terry came from Nottingham, and was engaged by the Melbourne Cricket Club as a professional bowler in 1875, having been recommended by Robert Allan Fitzgerald, the secretary of Marylebone Cricket Club, and Richard Daft of Nottinghamshire. He arrived in Melbourne in January 1876, bringing more than 200 cricket bats to sell. In 1876-77, when he umpired the first two Tests at the Melbourne Cricket Ground as part of his duties, his annual salary was 150 pounds; although his match performances for Melbourne were disappointing, he was highly regarded as a practice bowler. He remained as one of the club's professionals until after the 1880-81 season, then returned to Britain. He played three matches for Victoria from 1877 to 1881. He scored 60 runs at an average of 12 with a top score of 30, and took 6 wickets at an average of 15.66, with best figures of 3 for 23 against New South Wales in his first match in 1877-78. After umpiring the two Tests, Terry continued to stand as an umpire in first-class matches in Melbourne, and occasionally Sydney, until 1881. At the Australians' request, he also umpired a few of the matches played by the Australian touring teams to England in 1882 and 1884.

The Lab serves as a technical resource for the Department of Defense, NASA, and other government agencies. APL has developed numerous systems and technologies in the areas of air and missile defense, surface and undersea naval warfare, computer security, and space science and spacecraft construction. While APL provides research and engineering services to the government, it is not a traditional defense contractor, as it is a UARC and a division of Johns Hopkins University. APL is a scientific and engineering research and development division, rather than an academic division, of Johns Hopkins. Hopkins' Whiting School of Engineering offers part-time graduate programs through its Engineering for Professionals program. Courses are taught at seven locations in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, including the APL Education Center. History APL was created in 1942 during World War II under the Office of Scientific Research and Development's Section T as part of the Government's effort to mobilize the nation's science and engineering expertise within its universities. Its founding director was Merle Anthony Tuve, who led Section T throughout the war. Section T was created on August 17, 1940. According to the official history of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Scientists Against Time, APL was the name of Section T's main laboratory from 1942 onward, not the name of the organization overall. Section T's Applied Physics Laboratory succeeded in developing the variable-time proximity fuze that played a significant role in the Allied victory. In response to the fuze's success, the APL created the MK 57 gun director in 1944. Pleased with the APL's work, the Navy then tasked it with the mission to find a way to negate guided missile threats. From there on, the APL became very involved in wartime research. Expected to disband at the end of the war, APL instead became heavily involved in the development of guided missile technology for the Navy. At governmental request, the University continued to maintain the Laboratory as a public service. APL was originally located in Silver Spring, Maryland in a used-car garage at the former Wolf Motor Company building at 8621 Georgia Avenue. APL moved to Laurel beginning in 1954, with the construction of a two million dollar building and a US$700,000 wing expansion in 1956. The final staff transitioned to the new facility in 1975.http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/td2104/hagler.pdf The Johns Hopkins Gazette: March 25, 2002 Before moving to Laurel, APL also maintained the \\"Forest Grove Station\\", north of Silver Spring on Georgia Avenue near today's Forest Glen Metro,Google Maps which included a hypersonic wind tunnel. The Forest Grove Station was vacated and torn down in 1963 and flight simulations were moved to Laurel. The Laboratory's name comes from its origins in World War II, but APL's major strengths are systems engineering and technology application. More than three-quarters of the staff are technical professionals, and 25% have computer science and math degrees. APL conducts programs in fundamental and applied research; exploratory and advanced development; test and evaluation; and systems engineering and integration. = Wartime contributions = During the 1950s and the 1960s APL worked with the US Navy in the Operation Bumblebee Program on the Talos missile, Tartar missile, Terrier, and RIM-2 Terrier Surface to Air Missile systems. The follow-on RIM-50 Typhon Missile Project, based on improved Talos and Tartar Missiles, while successful, was cancelled in 1963 due to high costs and was eventually developed into the now well known Aegis Combat System based on an improved Terrier. In 1990, APL became involved with Operation Desert Storm and was involved in the among other efforts. In the same decade (1992), APL, along with Johns Hopkins University, developed an algorithm that allowed for automatic mammogram analysis. = Pershing = In 1965, the US Army contracted with APL to develop and implement a test and evaluation program for the Pershing missile systems. APL developed the Pershing Operational Test Program (OTP), provided technical support to the Pershing Operational Test Unit (POTU), identified problem areas and improved the performance and survivability of the Pershing systems.  Campus  The modern Applied Physics Laboratory is located in Laurel, Maryland, and spans 453 acres with more than 30 buildings on site. Additional auxiliary campuses exist in the surrounding areas.  Education  APL is also home to a Johns Hopkins graduate program in engineering and applied sciences, called Engineering for Professionals. Courses are taught at seven locations in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, including the APL Education Center. Research As of APL's 70th anniversary in 2012, there were over 600 projects in progress, spanning from those in APL's more traditional areas of work, including air defense, undersea warfare precision engagement and strategic systems to newer types of projects, including those in homeland security and cyber operations. Due to the nature of the APL's work, many of its projects' details are kept confidential. = Defense = The U.S. Navy continues to be APL's primary long-term sponsor. The Laboratory performs work for the Missile Defense Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, intelligence agencies, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and others. The Laboratory supports NASA through space science, spacecraft design and fabrication, and mission operations. APL has made significant contributions in the areas of air defense, strike and power projection, submarine security, antisubmarine warfare, strategic systems evaluation, command and control, distributed information and display systems, sensors, information processing, and space systems. = Space = Alan Stern celebrating the successful flyby of the Pluto system by New Horizons in 2015 in the APL Mission Operations Center. APL has built and operated many spacecraft, including the TRANSIT navigation system, NEAR, Geosat, ACE, TIMED, CONTOUR, MESSENGER, Van Allen Probes, the New Horizons mission to Pluto, the Parker Solar Probe mission to the outer corona of the Sun, and STEREO. In 2019, the APL proposed Dragonfly mission was selected as the fourth NASA New Frontiers mission.NASA selects Titan drone for next New Frontiers mission. Jeff Foust, Space News. June 27, 2019.

Dragonfly is a relocatable lander in an X8 octocopter configuration that will explore Saturn's moon Titan by flying between landing sites to move around the moon's surface. In July 2021, APL will launch the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (or DART) mission to strike the smaller body of a binary asteroid system; this will be the first NASA planetary defense mission.https://dart.jhuapl.edu/ Double Asteroid Redirection Test project site The asteroid 132524 APL was named in honor of APL after a flyby by the New Horizons spacecraft. = Prosthetics = In 2014, APL made history with the successful use of the Modular Prosthetic Limb ‚Äî a fully artificial articulated arm and hand ‚Äî by a bilateral shoulder-level amputee. APL used pattern recognition algorithms to track which muscles were contracting and enable the prosthetics to move in conjunction with the amputee's body. Similar technology was used in 2016 for a demonstration in which a paralyzed man was able to \\"fist-bump\\" Barack Obama using signals sent from an implanted brain chip. The limb returned sensory feedback from the arm to the wearer's brain. =Drones= The APL researches and produces unmanned aerial vehicles for the US military.

Early life Dheeran Chinnamalai was born on 17 April 1756 in present-day Kangeyam, Erode district. His birth name was Theerthagiri. Polygar wars Chinnamalai is said to be one of the commanders in the Polygar Wars, notably during the Second Polygar War that took place in 1801‚Äì1802. After Kattabomman and Tipu Sultan's deaths in 1799, Chinnamalai sought the help of Dhondia Wagh and Maruthu Pandiyar and lead the local Pattakarars Polygars, notably Varanavasi Gounder and Vella Gounder of Erode, Chinnamalai's sister's husband Kumara Vellai of Perundurai, Appachi Gounder of Paramathi-Velur, Aravakurichi Periya Thambi, Somandurai Muchadayandi Vanaraya Gounder of Pollachi and the Naicker Polygars of Dhali, Virupakshi and Ramagiri among others, to attack the British at Coimbatore in 1800. British forces managed to stop the armies of the allies and hence Chinnamalai was forced to attack Coimbatore along with the above Polygars of Kongu Nadu. His army was defeated and he escaped from the British forces. Chinnamalai engaged in guerrilla warfare and defeated the British in battles at Cauvery in 1801, Odanilai kangeyam in 1802 and Arachalur in 1804. Death Chinnamalai was betrayed by his cook Nallapan and was captured by the British in 1805. Nallappan usurped the title of Nallasenapthi Sarkarai Manradiar with British support. Some sources say he was hanged at Sankagiri Fort on 2 August 1805, as also were his two brothers; other sources give the date as 31 July. Legacy Dheeran Chinnamalai memorial at Sankagiri Statues and memorials commemorating Chinnamalai exist in Chennai, Tiruchirappalli, Erode and Odanilai. On 31 July 2005, a commemorative postage stamp commemorating him was released by India Post. Until 1997, Tiruchirapalli division of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation was known as Dheeran Chinnamalai Transport Corporation. The headquarter of Erode Municipal Corporation was named after him.

The worst property damage from Katrina occurred in coastal Mississippi, where all towns flooded over 90% in hours, and waves destroyed many historic buildings, with others gutted to the 3rd story. Afterward, 238 people died in Mississippi, and all counties in Mississippi were declared disaster areas, 49 for full federal assistance.\\"FEMA-1604-DR Mississippi Disaster Declaration as of 10/27/2005\\" (map), FEMA, ITS Mapping and Analysis Center, Washington, DC, 2005-10-27, webpage: FEMA-1604-pdf .\\"Information Relating to the Federal Appropriations for Katrina Recovery\\" (January 6, 2006), Office of the Governor, Mississippi, webpage: \\"Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour\\" [http://www.governorbarbour.com/Recovery/news/2006/jan/information.html GBarbour-Rec] .

The extent of the devastation in Mississippi is also staggering. Since Katrina hit, more than half a million people in Mississippi have applied for assistance from FEMA.

Scattered damage General: The effects of a hurricane can be scattered across a large area, because hurricanes are large complex storms which spawn smaller thunderstorms, tornadoes, storm surges, and sea waves. Wind speeds east of the eye can be 40‚Äì50 mph (64‚Äì80 km/h) higher than winds west of the eye. Wind gusts can be scattered, so boats or debris can ram one house but not another. One building can seem untouched, while others nearby are flattened; also trees can be partly weakened: tree limbs can fall months later, crashing onto a roof, automobile, fence, etc. Specific: Because Hurricane Katrina became a massive storm, Rob Marciano (CNN Meteorologist), Transcript of \\"Anderson Cooper 360 Degrees\\" (2006-08-29) 19:00 ET, CNN, CNN.com web: CNN-ACooper082906: \\"ROB MARCIANO, CNN Meteorologist: Responds to Anderson Cooper that the governor preferred that folks did not go out on the streets because the \\"streets are literally littered with kitchen appliances.\\" over 450 miles (720 km) wide, not only the eyewall-path, and 28-foot (9 m) storm surge, but also the outer bands of the hurricane arms caused scattered damage hundreds of miles away from the center. Eleven (11) spawned tornadoes were recorded in Mississippi (51 elsewhere). It is possible that scattered damage to northern Mississippi occurred, by spin-off storms, around the time Katrina made landfall in eastern Greater New Orleans (Louisiana's \\"boot toe\\") and then, again, near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, heading north-northeast into central Mississippi, at 10a.m. on August 29. Note that \\"landfall\\" occurred over towns submerged under 20 feet (6 m) of water. As buildings collapsed, water-tight appliances floated, sending refrigerators and dishwashers to ram other buildings and block streets. Millions of homes and buildings were affected, along with ships, boats, and more than 40 offshore oil rigs. Roadways and railways were put out of service by excessive amounts of debris and occasional collapse (most notably the I-10 Twin Span Bridge). Costs of debris removal in the Gulf Coast region is estimated at $200 million. Until major roadways (US 49, US 59) could be cleared, deliverers of supplies and other emergency relief were forced to detour through highway 609 or highway 43/603, though these routes were not officially posted.

Katrina made landfall below central Mississippi, 30 miles (48 km) east of New Orleans at 6:10 a.m., the storm's powerful, right, front quadrant covered coastal Mississippi and southern Alabama, increasing wind and flood damage. After making initial landfall in Louisiana, four hours later Katrina made another landfall north at the state line (near the mouth of the Pearl River) and passed over submerged towns around Bay St. Louis as a Category 3 hurricane with winds over 120 mph (192 km/h) and 28-foot (9 m) surge. Battered by wind, rain and storm surges, some beachfront neighborhoods were leveled entirely, with flooding 6‚Äì12 miles (10‚Äì19 km) inland, crossing Interstate-10 (I-10) in some places.

As Katrina passed 30 miles (48 km) east of central New Orleans, with 57 mph (91 km/h) winds, by 10a.m., landfall in Mississippi increased hurricane-force winds in an area of 600,000 Mississippi residents, covering several counties (see Figure KW10: Katrina Wind Speed map): Hancock, Harrison, Jackson County, Pearl River County, Stone, Walthall, Marion, Lamar County, Forrest County, and Perry County (see Map of Counties). Other counties to see a strong hurricane force impact of Katrina were Covington County, Jefferson Davis County, Simpson County, Smith County, Hinds County, Rankin County, and Scott County. Katrina maintained a high wind capacity of 80‚Äì85 mph in cities like Mendenhall, Magee, Jackson, Brandon, and Forest in Mississippi. Those cities contained much tree damage, roof and patio damage, power line damage, and much thrown debris. In Jackson, streets were cleared off due to the intense strong winds and rains that carried throughout the entire day. During this 10a.m. timeframe, hurricane-force winds continued over the barrier islands and Louisiana peninsula nearby; however, for the remainder of Louisiana, the winds were subsiding into gale-force winds after 10a.m. when Katrina was becoming primarily a Mississippi hurricane.Note in Figure KW10: Katrina Wind Speed map, the Louisiana winds subsided (yellow/green) remaining hurricane-force mainly at the peninsula south of the eyewall. Map of Mississippi Counties, noting flood/severe damage areas (yellow shaded counties). Several casinos, which were floated on barges to comply with Mississippi land-based gambling laws, were washed hundreds of yards inland by waves. According to MSNBC, a 28-foot (9 m) storm surge came ashore wiping out 90% of the buildings along the Biloxi-Gulfport coastline. A number of streets and bridges were washed away, including the bridge sections of U.S. Highway 90. In particular, the roadway portion of the U.S. Highway 90 bridge between Bay St. Louis and Pass Christian was completely destroyed by the storm; only the support structure was left. The three counties most affected by the storm were Hancock County, Harrison County, and Jackson County, although almost all counties had damage, and 47 counties were declared full disaster areas. Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) officials also recorded deaths in Hinds, Warren, and Leake counties. About 800,000 people through the state experienced power outages, which is almost a third of the population. Gates, Jimmie E. \\"Power to be restored - but not all at once.\\" The Clarion-Ledger. August 30, 2005. The three coastal counties of Mississippi, populated by about 400,000 people (almost the population of central New Orleans), had been mostly evacuated before Katrina flooded the region. Katrina's storm surge was the most extensive, as well as the highest, in the documented history of the United States; large portions of Hancock County, Harrison County, and Jackson County were inundated by the storm surge, affecting most of the populated areas. Surge covered almost the entire lower half of Hancock County, destroying the coastal communities of Clermont Harbor and Waveland, and much of Bay St. Louis, and flowed up the Jourdan River, flooding Kiln. In Harrison County, Pass Christian was completely inundated, along with a narrow strip of land to the east along the coast, which includes the cities of Long Beach and Gulfport; the flooding was more extensive in communities such as D'Iberville, which borders the Back Bay of Biloxi. Biloxi, on a peninsula between the Back Bay and the coast, was particularly hard hit, especially the low-lying Point Cadet area. In Jackson County, storm surge flowed up the wide river estuary, with the combined surge and freshwater floods cutting the county in half. Over 90% of Pascagoula, the easternmost coastal city in Mississippi, was flooded from surge. Other Jackson County communities such as Porteaux Bay were destroyed, and St. Martin was hard hit, along with Ocean Springs, Moss Point, Gautier, and Escatawpa. Two destroyers that were under construction at Litton- Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula were damaged, as well as the Amphibious assault ship USS Makin Island. Surveying the damage the day after Katrina's passing, Mississippi governor Haley Barbour called the scene indescribable, saying \\"I can only imagine that this is what Hiroshima looked like 60 years ago.\\"Staff writer, \\"What Hiroshima Looked Like .\\" [news24.com]. February 9, 2006. The mayor of Biloxi, A.J. Holloway, told the Biloxi Sun Herald, \\"This is our tsunami.\\" FOX News reporters, \\"'This Is Our Tsunami'\\" (2005-08-30), FOX News, FOXNews.com web: FOX-HK-tsunami. Relief and rebuilding efforts initially focused on restoring power and clearing communities of debris up to eight feet (2.4 m) in depth. Korosec, Thomas, \\"Small town in eye of storm wiped out,\\" Houston Chronicle, August 31, 2005. Many historic buildings were destroyed in Mississippi, including the cottages and second-story porches around the Beauvoir mansion, home of Jefferson Davis. Hundreds of irreplaceable Civil War-era artifacts from the Jefferson Davis home and museum were either lost or destroyed. The lower three floors of many high-rise casinos and hotels were gutted. (See details below). Along with countless others affected by the hurricane, U.S. senator Trent Lott lost his Pascagoula home, and the boyhood home of Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre was also totally destroyed. Psychological impact Both the Mississippi residents who survived the hurricanes as well as the disaster relief workers who supported them are at high risk of developing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD, a mental health disorder that can develop after exposure to an extreme situation such as warfare, a natural disaster or abuse.Warneka, T. Healing Katrina: Volunteering in Post-Hurricane Mississippi. Asogomi Publishing International.  Path of Hurricane Katrina  Although Hurricane Katrina later travelled mainly through Mississippi, it began as a Category 1 hurricane on August 25, crossing the southern tip of Florida (raining [36 cm]) into the Gulf, where it weakened, then strengthened into a massive Category 5 with 175 mph (280 km/h) sustained winds. Slowly turning north along the eastern coast of Louisiana, at 4a.m. August 29, sustained winds were 132 mph (211 km/h), 90 miles (114 km) SSE of New Orleans. As Katrina came ashore near Buras, LA at 6:10 CDT, with reported winds (Category 3), it passed east New Orleans was from the eye path connecting Buras to the Pearl River. of New Orleans and headed to the Mississippi state line (mouth of Pearl River, 10a.m. CDT), \\"Hurricane KATRINA.\\" (6am advisory) National Hurricane Center.

Despite the hurricane force centered on Mississippi, neighboring areas were also affected: when New Orleans began slowly flooding with high east/north winds, a 28-foot (9 m) storm surge eastward from Bay St. Louis devastated coastal areas with 30‚Äì55 foot (17 m) sea waves, flooding 12 miles (19 km) inland. The waves pushed barges, oil rigs, ships, and debris into submerged towns to flatten many coastal buildings across to Pascagoula with 20-foot (6 m) surge, \\"National Weather Service Forecast Office - Mobile/Pensacola,\\" NOAA, July 7, 2006, webpage: NOAA-Mob- Katrina. and into Alabama with 15-foot (5 m) surge and 24-foot (7 m) waves battering beach houses inside Mobile Bay and tilting the battleship . (See extensive details below).  Mississippi evacuation  By 4:30 a.m. CDT, on August 29, 2005, just hours before Hurricane Katrina landfall, many shelters in Mississippi were full to capacity, including many Red Cross shelters, the Jackson Coliseum (which allowed pets), and five special-needs shelters. The shelters had filled within 24 hours of opening. Days earlier, on August 25, when Hurricane Katrina crossed the southern tip of Florida, government offices in Mississippi had already discussed emergency evacuation plans for days. On August 26, the Mississippi National Guard was activated, raising the level of concern, and on August 27, the state government activated its Emergency Operations Center, and local governments began issuing evacuation orders: the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA)Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA), website: MEMA-web. advised not opening shelters in coastal counties. However, on August 28, the Red Cross also opened shelters in coastal counties, and by 7:00 p.m., 11 counties and eleven cities issued evacuation orders, a number which increased to 41 counties and 61 cities before the following morning, when Katrina came ashore. Moreover, 57 emergency shelters were established on coastal communities, with 31 additional shelters available to open if needed.... Since the evacuation was not total, many people survived the 30-foot (9 m) storm tide by climbing into the second-floor attic, or knocking out walls and ceiling boards to climb onto the roof or nearby trees.Unlike some suburbs, many towns in Mississippi had numerous strong trees, such as old oak trees, higher than roof-tops. Tree trunks remained standing,The tree trunks, after losing small branches, were narrow compared to wide walls battered by waves, boats and debris. even near the beaches, where many houses were leveled. Other people had swum to taller buildings or trees.Burdeau, Cain. \\"Waveland practically wiped off map by force of Katrina .\\" WWL-TV. August 31, 2005. Over 100 people were rescued from roof tops and trees in Mississippi. Although the population of the three (3) coastal counties had been nearly 400,000, and the storm tide was 20‚Äì30 feet (9 m) with coastal winds 75‚Äì120 mph (120‚Äì192 km/h), fewer than 250 people died in Mississippi during Hurricane Katrina.  Federal buildings/projects  Because of federal intent to rebuild or recover projects of the US Federal Government, the damage assessment to federal buildings in Mississippi covers actual costs: the amount needed to resume operations at market costs. The following federal projects are described in terms of damage, along with the cost to resume operations: * $1.987 billion: as requested by President George W. Bush, for Navy Shipbuilding and Conversion; these funds will assist Northrop Grumman to \\"replace destroyed or damaged equipment, prepare and recover naval vessels under contract; and provide for cost adjustments.\\" Ships were damaged in Pascagoula. * (unknown): as increased funding for USDA housing programs which provide subsidized loans and housing repair funding. * $75 million: in wildlife habitat restoration, for the Corps of Engineers to enhance estuarine habitats in Mississippi: following the Governor's proposal regarding oyster reef and coastal marsh restoration. The Mississippi Department of Marine Resources will assist the Corps as these projects develop. * $75 million: for the Corps of Engineers on various coastal projects: to accelerate completion of authorized projects along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. * $1.1 billion: to repair vital federal facilities in Mississippi, including: :: $292.5 million for the repair and renovation of the VA hospital in Biloxi. :: $45 million for the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport. :: $277.2 million for the United States Navy to help rebuild the Seabee base in Gulfport, and the Stennis Space Center. :: $43.4 million to help rebuild Keesler Air Force Base. :: $45 million for the Keesler Medical Center. :: $82.8 million for new Navy housing in the Gulfport/Stennis region. :: $324.8 million for housing at Keesler Air Force Base. :: $48.9 million for Navy housing at the Naval Air Station Meridian and at the Seabee base in Gulfport. The cost amounts were decided for work continuing in 2006. Note that repairs include modern renovation, since it is not feasible to assess damage in terms of restoring federal buildings to the year they were built. However, the costs provide a condensed measure of the construction damage, without counting the millions of lost roof tiles, thousands of broken windows, etc.  Hancock County  Coastal counties of Mississippi Hancock County was the scene of the final landfall of the eye of Hurricane Katrina, causing total devastation in Waveland, Bay St. Louis, Pearlington, and Clermont Harbor, as well as southern Diamondhead. The bridge between Bay St. Louis and Pass Christian was destroyed. Katrina's 28-foot (9 m) storm surge, and 55-foot (17 m) sea waves, practically obliterated Waveland, Mississippi, and state officials said that it took a harder hit from the wind and water than any other town along the coast. Katrina came ashore during the high tide of 8:01am,\\"2005 NOAA Tide Predictions: Waveland\\" (2005), tide on 29-Aug-2005, NOAA, web: NOAA-tide-tables. raising the storm tide by 2 ft (0.6 m), to over 30 feet (9 m). The storm dragged away almost every structure within one half mile of the beach, leaving driveways and walkways that went to nowhere. The death toll was estimated at about 50. In Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, a foot (30 cm) of water swamped the Emergency Operations Center at the Hancock County courthouse, which sits 30 feet (9 m) above sea level. Associated Press, \\"Katrina at a Glance\\" (August 31, 2005), page 4A, Mobile Register, web: MobileRegister-083105-PDF . Katrina also destroyed the first floor and dormitories of Saint Stanislaus All Boys High School. The destruction brought forth by Katrina also caused about one-quarter of the labor force to lose their jobs, with the unemployment rate reaching as high as 24.3%.Staff Writer. \\"Miss. unemployment dips slightly.\\" The Clarion-Ledger. November 24, 2005.  Harrison County  Damage to the Biloxi-Ocean Springs bridge. Damage to the riverboat Palace Casino located in Biloxi, Mississippi (MS), resulting from Hurricane Katrina. Harrison County, Mississippi was hit particularly hard by the hurricane and the storm surge. Its two largest coastal cities, Biloxi and Gulfport, suffered severe damages and a number of casualties. By September 126 people were already confirmed dead.Korosec, Thomas. \\"126 dead; gas, hot meals in short supply.\\" Houston Chronicle. September 1, 2005. Smaller coastal towns were also severely damaged. Much of Long Beach and most of Pass Christian, which bore the brunt of Category 5 Hurricane Camille in 1969, were leveled. Nearby Gulfshore Baptist Assembly, a camp owned and operated by the Mississippi Baptist Convention, has been permanently closed, and recommendations have been made to build a new facility elsewhere.Perkins, William H., Jr (November 9, 2006). \\"Messengers approve record CP budget.\\" The Baptist Record 130 (44): 1, 5. In the tourist town of Biloxi, widespread damage was reported as several of the city's attractions were destroyed. The lower 3 floors of many high-rise casino-hotels were gutted, as in the former Grand Casino of Gulfport, or the Imperial Palace (IP Hotel and Casino) or Beau Rivage in Biloxi.Note: see Beau Rivage about 3rd- floor damage to high-rise buildings. Many restaurants were destroyed and several casino barges had been washed out of the water and onto land. Residents who survived Hurricane Camille stated that Katrina was \\"much worse,\\" with a storm surge reportedly reaching further inland than the previous catastrophic storm. Katrina's wind estimates were lighter than Camille's, and the central air pressure was slightly higher, but Camille was also a much smaller storm so the greater impact of the storm surge may be due to the size. Keesler Air Force Base, also located in Biloxi, reported extensive damage to its facilities. Gulfport authorities reported to news station CNN that up to ten feet of water covered downtown streets. The Biloxi-Ocean Springs Bridge was also totally destroyed, and US 90 had heavy debris and severe damage to the roadbed. Thirty of the confirmed deaths in Harrison County were at the St. Charles apartment complex, said Kelly Jakubic with the county's Emergency Operations Center.Treaster, Joseph B.; Zernike, Kate. \\"Hurricane Katrina Slams Into Gulf Coast; Dozens Are Dead.\\" The New York Times. August 30, 2005. The apartment complex was reported, by local news sources, to have collapsed with dozens of residents inside. FOX News also reported deaths at the Quiet Water Beach apartments. (A later investigation by Biloxi's WLOX could not confirm any deaths at these apartments.Philips, Steve. \\"Rumor Sometimes Becomes National News.\\" WLOX. August 26, 2006.) Rebuilding in Harrison County proceeded at different paces in different towns. The town of Biloxi was greatly helped by the resurgence of the casino industry, while smaller towns such as Pass Christian did not have an economic base with which to start the reconstruction effort. By January 2007, almost a year and a half after the Hurricane, Pass Christian had still not yet begun rebuilding its city buildings, and volunteer labor was still involved in rebuilding private homes in the town.The town of Pass Christian was still actively recruiting volunteers to help rebuild and clean up the city through its website \\"Rebuild the Pass \\" The ECHL Mississippi Sea Wolves, which play in Biloxi, was forced to suspend operations for two years because of the aftermath of the hurricane causing damage to the Mississippi Coast Coliseum. The team resumed play in 2007. Jackson County Surge damage in Pascagoula, Mississippi. In Jackson County, the storm surge flowed up the wide river estuary, with the combined surge and freshwater floods cutting the county in half. Over 90% of Pascagoula, the easternmost coastal city in Mississippi, and east of Katrina's landfall, was flooded from surge. Other Jackson County communities such as Porteaux Bay and Gulf Hills were destroyed, and St. Martin was hard hit; Ocean Springs, Moss Point, Gautier, and Escatawpa also suffered major surge damage. United States Navy officials announced that two Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers that were under construction at Litton-Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula had been damaged by the storm, as well as the amphibious assault ship USS Makin Island. County totals Katrina disaster area: 49 counties for full Federal assistance (yellow shading). After Hurricane Katrina, all counties in Mississippi were declared disaster areas, with 49 counties eligible for full Federal assistance. The following Mississippi counties (alphabetical order) reported deaths, tornadoes, or damage: * Adams County: reported 2 deaths. * Forrest County: reported 7 deaths. * Hancock County: reported 51 deaths. * Harrison County: reported 126 deaths. * Hinds County: reported 1 death. * Jackson County: reported 12 deaths, and 2 tornadoes. * Jasper County: reported 1 tornado. * Jones County: reported 12 deaths. * Kemper County: reported 1 tornado. * Lamar County: reported 1 tornado. * Lauderdale County: reported 2 deaths, and 1 tornado. * Leake County: reported 1 death, and 3 tornadoes. * Lowndes County: reported 1 tornado. * Neshoba County: reported 2 tornadoes. * Oktibbeha County: reported 1 tornado. * Pearl River County: reported 17 deaths. * Scott County: reported 1 tornado. * Simpson County: reported 1 death. * Stone County: reported 1 death. * Warren County: reported 1 death. * Winston County: reported 1 tornado.

Long-term impact Rebuilding of towns took years, and some areas were not restored. The bay bridges were rebuilt taller and stronger, as had been done around Pensacola in the years following Hurricane Ivan (2004). Because all 3 Emergency Command Centers in the Mississippi coastal counties had been flooded over 30 feet (9 m) above sea level, the rules for command-center elevation were changed to relocate to even higher ground. The casino-gambling regulations were changed to allow casinos to be built on land in taller buildings, no longer forcing the use of massive floating casino barges near a city, which could again become battering rams along 2nd and 3rd-story levels of nearby hotels. Celebrities who had previously visited New Orleans came to understand the massive devastation that occurred along the Gulf Coast cities. The US Army Corps of Engineers developed plans to rebuild the protective barrier islands that had been washed out to sea along the coastal areas. Detailed reports were written describing how people had survived by swimming to taller buildings or trees, and noting that those too old or unable to swim did not survive. Many residents moved away and never returned. Medical studies attempted to estimate the indirect deaths caused by people losing their homes or local medical support.

Synopsis The series was produced in black-and- white by Ansett Television Films and made in-house by the Ten Network as part of an attempt to rival the police dramas produced by Crawford Productions such as Homicide and Division 4. The Long Arm was set in Melbourne, with segments shot in Sydney, and as well as its episodes being based on real-life cases, it attempted to introduce a soap opera feel by examining the private lives of the detectives. The series was produced by Ron Beck and starred Robert Bruning, Sandy Harbutt, Lyndall Moor, and Barbara Mason, with Ken Goodlet and Tony Ward appearing in semi-regular roles. Namesake The Long Arm was also the name of an unrelated 1956 film starring Jack Hawkins.

The AllMusic Guide to Jazz wrote that \\"there have not been many saxophonists and flutists more naturally soulful than David 'Fathead' Newman.\\"Ron Wynn, et al., All Music Guide to Jazz, 495 (Miller Freeman Books 1994) Newman was a leading exponent of the \\"Texas Tenor\\" saxophone style, a big-toned, bluesy approach popularized by jazz tenor players from that state. Early life and career Newman was born in Corsicana, Texas, on February 24, 1933, but grew up in Dallas, where he studied first the piano and then the saxophone. According to one account, he got his nickname \\"Fathead\\" in school when \\"an outraged music instructor used it as an epithet after catching Mr. Newman playing a Sousa march from memory rather than from reading the sheet music, which rested upside down on the stand.\\" Inspired by the jump blues bandleader Louis Jordan, Newman took up the alto saxophone in the seventh grade, and was mentored by former Count Basie saxophonist Buster Smith.Bill Dahl, \\"The Saxmen,\\" liner notes to Ray Charles: Genius and Soul, Rhino Records (1997). He went off to Jarvis Christian College on a music and theology scholarship but quit school after three years and began playing professionally, mostly jazz and blues, with a number of musicians, including Smith, pianist Lloyd Glenn, and guitarist bandleaders Lowell Fulson and T-Bone Walker. Sideman and soloist with Ray Charles Newman met and befriended Ray Charles in early 1951 when Charles was playing piano and singing with the Lowell Fulson band. Newman joined Charles‚Äô band in 1954 as a baritone saxophone player, but later switched to tenor and became Charles‚Äô principal saxophone soloist after tenor saxophonist Don Wilkerson left the band.Robert Palmer, liner notes to The Birth of Soul: the Complete Atlantic Rhythm & Blues Recordings 1952-1959, Atlantic Records (1991). Many of Charles‚Äô seminal recordings during the 1950s and early 1960s feature a saxophone solo by Newman. These include hits such as \\"Lonely Avenue,\\" \\"Swanee River Rock,\\" \\"Ain‚Äôt That Love,\\" \\"The Right Time\\" (with Newman on alto sax), and \\"Unchain My Heart\\".liner notes to The Birth of Soul: the Complete Atlantic Rhythm & Blues Recordings 1952-1959, Atlantic Records (1991). Although his solos were short in duration, they became, as the New York Times later noted, \\"crucial to the Ray Charles sound.\\"Ben Ratliff, \\"David (Fathead) Newman, Saxophonist, Dies at 75,\\" New York Times, January 22, 2009. Atlantic Records‚Äô producer Jerry Wexler, who signed Charles to the label, called Newman Charles‚Äô \\"alter ego on tenor.\\"Jerry Wexler, Rhythm and the Blues: A Life in American Music, 106 (Knoph 1993). Charles said that Newman \\"could make his sax sing the song like no one else.\\"Ray Charles and David Ritz, Brother Ray: Ray Charles‚Äô Own Story, 175 (Dial Press, 1978). As Newman himself put it, \\"I became famous for playing 8-bar and 12-bar solos!\\" In 1959, Newman released his debut album as a leader, Fathead: Ray Charles Presents David Newman, with Charles playing piano. He stayed with Charles‚Äô band until 1964, and rejoined the group in 1970‚Äì1971. Later life and career After leaving Charles' band, Newman worked with Herbie Mann's band in 1970-71, and recorded albums for Atlantic, Warner Bros., Prestige and Muse. Newman did session work with a variety of artists, including Aretha Franklin, B.B. King, Joe Cocker, Dr. John, and with Natalie Cole on her Unforgettable album. He also worked as a sideman with Jimmy Scott, B.B. King, and Lou Rawls. He also scored films and performed in the Robert Altman film Kansas City and did a national tour with the band from that 1996 film for Verve records. In 1990 he was nominated for a Grammy Award for recordings with Art Blakey and Dr. John. Newman was portrayed by Bokeem Woodbine in the 2004 Ray Charles biopic Ray starring Jamie Foxx. While praising Foxx's performance as Ray Charles, Newman disputed the accuracy of the film's depiction of himself, in particular its portrayal of him as having introduced Charles to hard drugs. Newman died in Kingston, New York, at the age of 75 of pancreatic cancer. Over the years up to 2008, Newman recorded over thirty-eight albums under his own name, including his first, Fathead, Ray Charles Presents David 'Fathead' Newman, recorded in 1958,Feather, Leonard & Gitler, Ira The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz Oxford University Press US, 2007 but not released until 1960, and the second, The Sound of the Wide Open Spaces!!!!, with James Clay, produced by Cannonball Adderley. He also played R&B; and blues, appearing on recordings with Jimmy Scott, Stanley Turrentine, Aretha Franklin, B. B. King, the Average White Band, Jimmy McGriff, Eric Clapton, John Stein, Natalie Cole, Hank Crawford, Aaron Neville, Queen Latifah, Richard Tee, Dr. John, Cheryl Bentyne of the Manhattan Transfer, Gregg Allman, and country-rock/tex-mex artist Doug Sahm. The late Roy Hargrove, trumpeter, band leader and composer (1969-2018) credits hearing Mr. Newman play while Hargrove was still a high school student and being enthralled by his jazz improvisation. Mr. Newman performed with Hargrove and recorded several tunes on Hargrove‚Äôs 1995 album entitled Family. Death On January 20, 2009, Newman died from complications of pancreatic cancer.

It is a low-water, labor- intensive method that uses younger seedlings singly spaced and typically hand weeded with special tools. It was developed in 1983 by the French Jesuit Father Henri de Laulani√© in Madagascar.Intensive Rice Farming in Madagascar by H. De Laulani√©, in Tropicultura, 2011, 29, 3, 183-187 The system was not fully tested and spread throughout the rice growing regions of the world until some years later, with the help of Cornell University and others. History and main ideas The practices that culminated in SRI began in the 1960s based on Fr. de Laulanie's observations. Principles included applying a minimum quantity of water and the individual transplanting of very young seedlings in a square pattern. SRI concepts and practices have continued to evolve as they are being adapted to rain-fed (unirrigated) environments and with transplanting being sometimes replaced by direct-seeding. The central principles of SRI according to Cornell researchers are:Cornell University, System of Rice Intensification * Rice field soils should be kept moist rather than continuously saturated, minimizing anaerobic conditions, as this improves root growth and supports the growth and diversity of aerobic soil organisms. * Rice plants should be planted singly and widely spaced to permit root and canopy growth to keep all leaves photosynthetically active. * Rice seedlings should be transplanted when young, less than 15 days old with just two leaves, quickly, shallowly, and carefully, to avoid trauma to roots and minimize transplant shock. Spread The spread of SRI from Madagascar has been credited to Norman Uphoff, former director of the Cornell International Institute for Food, Agriculture and Development at Cornell from 1990 to 2005. In 1993, Uphoff met officials from Association Tefy Saina, an NGO set up in Madagascar in 1990 by de Laulanie to promote SRI. He observed SRI for three years and witnessed Malagasy farmers who previously averaged two tons harvest per hectare, averaged eight tons per hectare with SRI. Uphoff was persuaded of the merits of SRI, and in 1997 started to promote SRI in Asia. Uphoff estimates that by 2013 the number of smallholder farmers using SRI had grown to between four to five million. The rapid spread of SRI around the globe, and especially in India, can be partially attributed to the smart communication strategies by its proponents in which several newspapers in India disproportionately provided coverage on SRI and effective coalition building among several national and international organisations. Evaluation Proponents and critics of SRI debate the claimed benefits and many questions about it remain unresolved. Wageningen University has published an article discussing the challenges of evaluating SRI in which a concluding sentence reads, \\"Although the technical aspects of SRI have been contested, it clearly exists as a real social phenomenon.\\" A review of the literature led researchers at Cornell to conclude that SRI, on average, increased yields 20 to 200%, improved resistance to environmental stresses, and increased carbon sink activity while reducing emissions, making it a triple-win for agriculture, climate security, and food security. =Successes= Proponents of SRI claim its use increases yield, saves water, reduces production costs, and increases income and that benefits have been achieved in 40 countries. Uphoff published an article in the International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability stating that SRI \\"can raise irrigated rice yields to about double the present world average without relying on external inputs, also offering environmental and equity benefits.\\" There is some evidence from northern Thailand that SRI has achieved some success there. A special issue on SRI in the non-scientific journal Paddy and Water Environment collected recent findings in support of SRI. In 2011 five farmers reported that they had beaten rice yield records; the best was a farmer named Sumant Kumar, who reported setting a new world record in rice production of 22.4 tons per hectare using SRI, beating the existing world record held by the Chinese scientist Yuan Longping by three tons. In 2014 S. Sethumadhavan of Alanganallur, India reported a record yield of nearly 24 tonnes of paddy rice per hectare using SRI. These reported records were not obtained under audited supervision nor under standard methods for measuring yields. They were not subjected to peer review, being reported only in the popular press, and are suspected to be physically impossible in the localities where they were obtained. =Criticism= Critics of SRI suggest that claims of yield increase in SRI are due to unscientific evaluations. They object that there is a lack of detail on the methodology used in trials and a lack of corroborating evidence in the peer-reviewed literature.Field Crops Research Stubborn facts: Still no evidence that the System of Rice Intensification out-yields best management practices (BMPs) beyond Madagascar by A J Mcdonald, P R Hobbs, S J Riha in Field Crops Research, Volume: 108, Issue: 2, 2008, Pages: 188-191 Some critics suggested that SRI success was unique to soil conditions in Madagascar. Despite these claims, as of 2020 over 1,200 articles and communications about SRI in various countries had been published in scientific journals. Web page updated continuously.

This is thought to represent mineralization, or small deposits of calcium, in the muscle of the heart. EIFs are found in about 3‚Äì5% of normal pregnancies and cause no health problems. EIFs themselves have no impact on health or heart function. Often the EIF is gone by the third trimester. If there are no problems or chromosome abnormalities, EIFs are considered normal changes, or variants. Association with birth defects Researchers have noted an association between an EIF and a chromosome problem in the baby. Types of chromosome problems that are occasionally seen include trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). In the case of an isolated EIF, and no other ultrasound findings, some studies show that the risk for a chromosome abnormality is approximately two times a woman's background risk. Other studies report up to a 1% risk for Down syndrome when an EIF is seen on a second trimester fetal ultrasound exam. A clue to chromosome problems An EIF is one clue which can contribute to the chances of a chromosome problem existing. Generally the risks are low if there are no other risk factors. Many babies with chromosome problems do not show any signs on ultrasound. Other factors are discussed in counseling include: * Mother's age at the expected date of delivery * The results of the Expanded AFP blood triple test * Evidence of other \\"fetal findings\\" seen on the ultrasound that suggest a chromosome problem. Options The best available evidence suggests that an isolated echogenic intracardiac focus in the fetus of an otherwise low risk woman does not confer an increased risk of fetal aneuploidy. Although some studies have reported that the number or location of echogenic foci affects the risk of fetal aneuploidy (higher risk with biventricular or right ventricular involvement), the general consensus is that these factors have not been proven to matter. When an echogenic intracardiac focus is identified in an otherwise normal second trimester fetus, a normal cell-free DNA test can be very reassuring and obviate the need for invasive testing. Amniocentesis is a test to check a baby's chromosomes. A small amount of amniotic fluid, which contains some fetal cells, is removed and tested. Amniocentesis is very accurate; however, there is a risk of miscarriage which occur in 0.5‚Äì1% of women who have amniocentesis. Results take about two weeks. A normal amniocentesis result means the EIF is not significant and there would be no other concerns about it. That is usually done between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy (during the second trimester). Summary An EIF in the fetal heart may indicate an increased chance of the baby having a chromosome problem. It does not affect the development of the baby or the function of the heart. If the baby has normal chromosomes, there would be no associated problems to be concerned about. No special treatment or tests are needed at delivery. It is important to remember that with an isolated EIF, chances are strongly in favor of a normal pregnancy outcome, but the patient is entitled to further counseling and testing options.

The first, Bletchley Town FC, changed its name to Milton Keynes City in 1974, and used the name until its dissolution in 1985. The second, originally called Mercedes-Benz, became MK City in 1998, and retained the name until its own demise in 2003, coinciding with the relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes. First former incarnation (1974‚Äì85) The first version was a Southern League team founded in 1956 as Bletchley & WIPAC Football club before changing their name a year later to Bletchley Town. The club changed name again in 1974 to become Milton Keynes City. The club was poorly supported and posted a series of woeful finishes, never reaching the top half of their league. The club's only major achievement was victory in the 1979‚Äì80 Berks & Bucks Senior Cup. In 1979, after yet another poor season which saw the club finish second from bottom, Ron Noades, then chairman of Wimbledon, claimed to have entered talks with the Milton Keynes Development Corporation, although this was denied by the Corporation, about the possibility of moving the south London club to Milton Keynes. Noades purchased a controlling interest in Milton Keynes City and installed fellow Wimbledon directors including Sam Hammam, Bernie Coleman and Jimmy Rose as directors on top of their identical roles at Wimbledon, which at that time was still legal under the Football Association's rules. His intention was to merge the two clubs to produce a club based in Milton Keynes using Wimbledon's place in the Football League. This idea was never seriously developed and was abandoned when he sold his interest in Milton Keynes City the following year. Further poor seasons followed with no financial backing and eventually the club was wound up five years later at the end of the 1984‚Äì85 season. During their existence, Milton Keynes City were known as 'the Gladiators' played their home games at the City Ground, Manor Field in Bletchley ‚Äì a stadium with a 4,000 capacity. Colours were tangerine and black. Under their original identity the team twice reached the 4th Qualifying round of the FA Cup in the mid-sixties. Second former incarnation (1998‚Äì2003) The second version only existed for a few seasons from the late 1990s, playing in the Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division. The 1990s club began as a Sunday league football club known as Mercedes-Benz Football Club, after the factory where many of the players worked. Mercedes-Benz changed their name to Milton Keynes City in 1998, and moved into Wolverton Park, which had been the home of Wolverton A.F.C. until their demise six years earlier. As with Bletchley in the 1970s, City's directors believed that they could build their club up to be accepted as representing Milton Keynes as a whole, but a severe lack of local interest in this plan meant that they never achieved it. Following the resignation of the directors in June 2003, the team folded in July, unable to secure the investment needed to continue. The club's chairman, Bob Flight, cited both a lack of any local football interest in the area and \\"the confused situation\\" surrounding Wimbledon F.C.'s proposed move to MK, which happened two months later. (Wimbledon were renamed Milton Keynes Dons the following year, in July 2004). Current incarnation (2005 onwards) The former Milton Keynes City Youth FC, an amateur youth football club, renamed itself as Milton Keynes City FC in 2005 and says that it is amongst the larger youth clubs in the locality.Milton Keynes City FC: History See also * Current non-League clubs in the Milton Keynes borough References Category:Defunct football clubs in England Category:Association football clubs established in 1956 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1985 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 2003 Category:Sport in Milton Keynes Category:Southern Football League clubs Category:Metropolitan League Category:1956 establishments in England Category:1985 disestablishments in England Category:2003 disestablishments in England Category:Defunct football clubs in Buckinghamshire ","title":"Milton Keynes City F.C."},{"id":"2601173","text":"A Short Message Service Center (SMSC) is a network element in the mobile telephone network. Its purpose is to store, forward, convert and deliver Short Message Service (SMS) messages. The full designation of an SMSC according to 3GPP is Short Message Service - Service Center (SMS-SC). Basic trajectories SMS can be directed in several ways: # From mobile to another mobile - referred to as MO-MT (Mobile Originated - Mobile Terminated) # From mobile to a content provider (also known as Large Account / ESME) - referred to as MO-AT (Mobile Originated - Application Terminated) # From application to a mobile - referred to as AO-MT (Application Originated - Mobile Terminated) Operation The tasks of an SMSC can be described as # Reception of text messages (SMS) from wireless network users # Storage of text messages # Forwarding of text messages # Delivery of text messages (SMS) to wireless network users # Maintenance of unique time stamps in text messages When a user sends a text message (SMS message) to another user, the message gets stored in the SMSC (short message service centre), which delivers it to the destination user when they are available. This is a store and forward option. An SMS centre (SMSC) is responsible for handling the SMS operations of a wireless network. # When an SMS message is sent from a mobile phone, it will first reach an SMS centre. # The SMS centre then forwards the SMS message towards the destination. # The main duty of an SMSC is to route SMS messages and regulate the process. If the recipient is unavailable (for example, when the mobile phone is switched off), the SMSC will store the SMS message. # It will forward the SMS message when the recipient is available and the message's expiry period is not exceeded. SMSCs can be used to interface with other applications, for example a spreadsheet can interface with the SMSC allowing messages to be sent SMS from an Excel spreadsheet, or to send an SMS from Excel. Inbound messages to a long number or short code can also be passed through the SMSC allowing m2m communications or Telematics. =Validity period of an SMS message= An SMS message is stored temporarily in the SMS center if the recipient mobile phone is unavailable. It is possible on most mobile handsets to specify an expiry period after which the SMS message will be deleted from the SMS center.

He was the first scholastic writer to unite the Oxonian and Parisian traditions in 14th-century philosophy, and his work had a lasting influence in the Late Middle Ages and Reformation. His scholastic nicknames were Doctor acutus and Doctor authenticus. Life Gregory was born in Rimini around 1300. He joined the Order of the Hermits of Saint Augustine before studying theology in the 1320s at the University of Paris, where he encountered the ideas of the late Franciscan Peter Auriol. In the 1330s he taught at Augustinian schools in Bologna, Padua and Perugia, where he became familiar with the recent work of Oxford thinkers such as Adam Wodeham, William Ockham, and Walter Chatton. He returned to Paris in 1342 to prepare his lectures on Peter Lombard's Sentences, which he delivered in 1342‚Äì1344. Because of his familiarity with English philosophy during this time, he effectively transmitted contemporary Oxford ideas‚Äîwith an Augustinian tinge‚Äîto Paris. He became a Master of Theology in 1345 and subsequently taught at schools in Padua and Rimini. Gregory died in Vienna in 1358 shortly after being named General of his Order. Philosophy In his lifetime, Gregory composed a number of philosophical works including analytical tables to accompany his own lectures, tables on Saint Augustine's works, and a few governmental letters. Yet, his most important works are the lectures on Books I and II of Peter Lombard's Sentences. (This should have been on the four books, but books III and IV seem to have been lost, or were never written). Many later scholastics copied long passages from his works. Those who borrowed from him or were influenced by him include the Cistercian James of Eltville, Pierre d'Ailly, and Henry of Langenstein. =Augustinianism= The most important influence in Gregory's thought was St Augustine. Gregory read Augustine more carefully and extensively than his predecessors, and so was able to attack Auriol for his faulty citations and quotations of Augustine, as well as for his Semipelagianism. Gregory adhered to Augustine's predestination and famously condemned unbaptised infants to Hell, for which he gained the nickname Infantium Tortor (torturer, or tormentor, of infants). =Theory of sentences= Initially, with the intention of defining theology and natural sciences, Rimini developed a theory of sentences to describe scientific knowledge. He believed sentences neither to be extra-mental nor propositional; in this theory, sentences signify something exclusively by the make-up of their terms, but are neither reducible to individual terms nor are \\"mental sentences\\" identifiable. Defenders of this view claim that beliefs about the world are too complicated to correspond to specific language structures and thus, cannot serve as objects of scientific knowledge. =Nominalism= Gregory Rimini had a unique take on traditional nominalist views. He thought that to contrive understanding in physical reality by incorporating abstract objects was nonsensical, due to his belief that mental objects are used strictly for convenient social conventions and nothing else. With this divide between complex thought and physical reality, Rimini also believed statements describing infinitely many points, infinitely many lines, infinitely many planes, etc. are all false. Since these are all mental, abstract objects, they only exist in the minds of people who think about them. Thus, the notion of physical infinity is not applicable. Furthermore, God was always in close relation to these abstract objects, too. Rimini's nominalist view claims that God has the ability to distinguish abstract objects but has no need to manipulate them. To Rimini, God has no need to manipulate mathematical propositions because he exists outside of time and thus, has no need to think deductively about the individual abstract objects anyway.

They are located in the Northeastern Piedmont area. The Haliwa-Saponi hold membership on the North Carolina Commission of Indian Affairs. The name Haliwa is derived from the two counties: Halifax and Warren, which are the ancestral homelands of the Haliwa people dating from the 1730s. They re-organized and adopted their current form of government in 1953 and were recognized in 1965 by the state of North Carolina. In 1979 the tribe added Saponi to their name to reflect their descent from the historical Saponi peoples, part of the large Siouan languages family, who were formerly located in the Piedmont of present-day Virginia and the Carolinas. Since the late nineteenth century, the tribe has created schools and other institutions to preserve its culture and identity. Their common worship in Protestant churches, mostly Baptist and Methodist, has long acted to support community traditions. For years the people were also united through their subsistence activities and oral traditions. Today the young people readily use technology among their skills, while creating to new arts and crafts related to traditions.  Demographics  The Haliwa-Saponi comprise slightly more than 3,800 enrolled citizens. About 80% of tribal members reside within a 6-mile radius of the small unincorporated town of Hollister, in Halifax and Warren counties. Some tribal members are also located in Nash and Franklin counties. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, approximately 2,737 Native Americans reside in Halifax and Warren counties, representing 3.5% of the total combined population. Between 1980 and 2000, the Native American population of the two counties increased by 48%, according to self-identification on the United State Census. During that time, the Black population increased by 15%, the Hispanic population increased by 50%, and the White population decreased by 5%. The Haliwa-Saponi host one of the largest pow-wows in the state of North Carolina, held annually the third weekend in April of each year to celebrate the anniversary of the tribe's state recognition. The Pow-Wow is held at the Haliwa-Saponi Tribal School, located on tribal grounds.  Government  The Haliwa-Saponi Indian Tribe is governed by an eleven-member Council elected to three-year staggered terms by the enrolled citizens of the Tribe; these include an elected Chief and Vice-Chief.Haliwa-Saponi Tribe Website Education Members founded the Haliwa-Saponi Tribal School in 1957, which was assisted by the state as a public school. All other public schools had long been segregated as white or black (all people of color) under state law, and the Haliwa Saponi claimed a separate identity. The school closed in the late 1960s following the court-ordered integration of public schools on constitutional grounds. In 1999, with funds from the state Department of Public Instruction (DPI), the tribe established a charter school in the same building as the earlier tribal school. Focused on Haliwa-Saponi culture, this new school has expanded in space and enrollment over time, and by 2007 served grades K-12. In 1977 the tribe established the Haliwa-Saponi Day Care Center, to serve children aged two to five. The tribe manages a myriad of programs and services for its citizens, including, but not limited to, housing, substance- abuse-prevention programs, cultural programs and others.  Culture  The tribe's annual pow-wow was opened to the public in 1965 to celebrate state recognition of the tribal nation. Originating in the pan-Indian movement, the pow-wow \\"also builds on local and regional values, and ideas about tribe, community and race.\\"Richardson, Marvin, and C.S. Everett. \\"Ethnicity Affirmed: The Haliwa-Saponi and the Dance, Culture, and Meaning of North Carolina Powwows\\", in Signifying Serpents and Mardi Gras Runners: Representing Identity in Selected Souths, ed. Celeste Ray and Luke Eric Lassiter. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2003, accessed 16 June 2011 Held the third weekend of April, the pow-wow is funded in part by ad sales, donations, corporate funding and gate receipts, in addition to grants from the North Carolina Arts Council. More than 100 volunteers and staff make the pow-wow happen. Attendance for the three-day event ranges from 9,000 to 10,000. The tribe also operates a cultural retention program for tribal citizens of all ages, held at the tribe's multi-purpose building. The program includes instruction in pottery, beadwork/regalia design and construction, dance/drum classes, and Haliwa- Saponi history, as well as day trips to culturally relevant locations.  History  The Haliwa-Saponi descend from the Tuscarora, Nansemond & Saponi a Siouan-speaking Native American tribe of North America's Southeastern Piedmont. In 1670, John Lederer, a German surveyor, visited a Saponi settlement along the Staunton (now the Roanoke River) River in southern Virginia. Thirty years later, John Lawson, commissioned by the Lords Proprietor to survey the Carolina colony's interior, encountered groups of Saponi as they conducted trade. Throughout the post-contact period of increasing English colonial settlement and expansion, southeastern Siouan Piedmont peoples such as the Saponi maintained autonomous villages in what is now southern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. During the late 17th century, the Saponi undertook a political alliance with the culturally related Tottero, or Tutelo; together they comprised the Nassaw Nation. Due to frequent incursions into Saponi territory by the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Five Nations) from present-day New York and Pennsylvania, the Saponi and their allies temporarily relocated. They migrated south through the regions of present-day Virginia and North Carolina, while continuing to seek economically and militarily advantageous alliances. = Eighteenth century = By the beginning of the century, continuous warfare with the Haudenosaunee and, especially, repeated outbreaks of infectious diseases contracted from Europeans reduced the once populous Saponi. Joining with the Tottero, the Saponi migrated to northeastern North Carolina to be closer to the center of Virginia's colonial trade and gradually became allied with the colonists. In 1711, the Carolina colony went to war with the powerful Iroquoian-speaking Tuscarora, in part because the latter resisted Indian slavery. With the defeat of the Tuscarora two years later, the colony and its allied Saponi met in Williamsburg with the Tuscarora and Nottoway to discuss the terms of peace. Most of the Tuscarora migrated from Carolina to present-day New York, where by 1722 they were adopted as the Sixth Nation of the Iroquois Confederacy, to whom they were related by language and culture. The Saponi entered into a new treaty of trade with Virginia's governor, Alexander Spotswood. On February 27, 1714, the Virginia colony reached an agreement. The remnants of the Saponi, Tottero, Occaneechi, Keyauwee, Enoke (or Eno), and Shakori formally coalesced, becoming \\"The Saponi Nation.\\" Another band, the Stuckanox, soon joined the Saponi Nation. Despite the success in treaty-making and tribal coalitions, the years between 1709 and 1714 were extremely difficult. Disease caused continuing population decline. Travelers enumerated the Saponi Nation at a little more than 300 people. That same year, the Virginia Council asked the Nansemond tribe to merge with the Saponi to strengthen their settlements. They hoped these people could create a buffer between Virginia's plantation settlements, other Southeastern Siouan Piedmont Native Americans, and the Haudenosaunee from the North.  Fort Christanna  To strengthen Virginia's borders, Alexander Spotswood convinced the colonial Board of Trade to approve the establishment of Fort Christanna between the Roanoke and Meherrin rivers, about thirty-two miles north of the present-day Haliwa-Saponi powwow grounds. Fort Christanna was built to protect the Virginia colony in two critical ways: as a bulwark intended to ward off military assault, and as a center for the Christian conversion and education of the Saponi and other Southeastern groups. Fort Christanna also served as a major trading post for the corporate Virginia Indian Company. = Decline of Indian trade = Roughly seventy Saponi children were educated and converted to Christianity at Fort Christanna by the missionary teacher Charles Griffin of North Carolina. By 1717, under charges of monopoly, the Colonial Board of Trade lost interest in the Fort and ordered the Virginia Indian Company to disband and dissolve. The Saponi Nation continued to maintain peaceful trade relations with the colony. A portion of the Saponi Nation continued living in the Fort Christanna area from 1717 to 1729. Another group of Saponi migrated into northern Virginia, near Fredericksburg on the Rapahannock River. Historians Marvin Richardson and C. S. Everett note historical documentation for the modern Haliwa-Saponi tribe as descending from a group that arose during the 1730s, a tumultuous time of decline of the Indian trade. The divisive Tuscarora and Yamasee wars affected colonists, Native Americans and Indian trade in Virginia and the Carolinas. Remnants of smaller tribes coalesced after this period to continue their Indian culture and identity. A group of Saponi migrated south to the militarily and linguistically related Catawba, in what is now northeastern South Carolina. They occupied a village there from 1729 to 1732, but in 1733 returned to the Fort Christianna area with some Cheraw. Discovering that colonists had taken patents on their traditional territory, the Saponi made agreements with Virginia for new lands. They also made a separate arrangement with the remaining band of Tuscarora in April 1733, to live with them and under their sovereignty. The majority of the Saponi migrated to North Carolina with traders and planters, settling in what are now Halifax and Warren counties. Fewer went to the reservation for the Tuscarora, known as Reskooteh Town and Indian Wood. It was located in Bertie County. The reservation consisted initially of 40,000 acres (160 km¬≤) and bordered eastern Halifax County. By 1734, some Algonquian-speaking Nansemond lived with the Nottoway in Virginia. Other Nansemond had resettled near the Tuscarora in North Carolina. During the 1730s and 1740s and through the time of the American Revolution, because of living in more diverse areas, the Saponi intermarried with European colonists and free people of color, but Saponi mothers raised their mixed-race children in Saponi culture. After the Revolution, the Native Americans maintained a separate identity from both the European Americans and African Americans, and married mostly within the Indian community. In addition, they created institutions to support their cultural identity as American Indians. Virginia traders such as Colonel William Eaton, who wanted to continue their business relations with the tribes, also migrated to North Carolina. He was a resident of \\"Old Granville\\" (modern day Franklin, Warren, and Vance) counties. He traded with the Saponi, Catawba, and others. =Migrations= In 1740 most of the remaining Saponi in Virginia moved north to Pennsylvania and New York, where they merged with the Iroquois for protection. After the American Revolutionary War and victory by the colonists, they moved with the Iroquois to Canada, as four of the six nations had been allies of the British and were forced to cede their territories in New York State. The British government provided land and some relocation assistance to their Iroquois allies. This was the last time in which the Saponi tribe appeared in the historical record.Henry H. Mitchell, \\"Rediscovering Pittsylvania's ‚ÄúMissing‚Äù Native Americans\\", The Pittsylvania Packet (Pittsylvania Historical Society, 1997, pp. 4‚Äì8, accessed 16 June 2011 The families are known to be descendants of and closely associated into the core Richardson, Silver, Mills, Evans, Hedgepeth and Lynch families. Most Haliwa-Saponi Indians trace direct lineage to Benjamin Richardson ( the core Richardson family consisting of Emily Richardson & Frank Richardson, Mason Richardson, Rhease Richardson, Eliza Silver, Alfred & Hardie Richardson), Martha Silver, Patsy Lynch ( Mother of Charles Lynch), James Evans, Stephen Hedgepeth, Nathan Mills & others. From the 1730s to the 1770s, Haliwa-Saponi ancestors settled in and near the modern Haliwa-Saponi area in North Carolina. The Haliwa-Saponi community began coalescing in \\"The Meadows\\" of southwestern Halifax County, North Carolina immediately after the American Revolution. Much reduced in number, the few remaining Tuscarora migrated from Bertie County to New York in 1804, joining others on a reservation there. Their reservation land in North Carolina had been steadily reduced through the eighteenth century and was finally sold off. = Nineteenth century = During the early 19th century, ancestral Haliwa- Saponi remained relatively isolated in the Meadows. They attempted to live peaceably alongside their neighbors. During the 1830s, when the United States enforced policies to remove all Indians living east of the Mississippi River, the federal government basically ignored most of the relatively landless and powerless small tribes settled in the southeastern Coastal Plain. Haliwa- Saponi tribal elders tell of several families who voluntarily migrated west to Indian Territory on their own, some merging into the general population, while others were adopted by one of the so-called Five Civilized Tribes from the Southeast. Over the course of the 19th century, the Haliwa-Saponi maintained a tight-knit tribal community in modern Halifax, Warren, Nash, and Franklin counties and generally practiced endogamy. Having become Christian, they belonged mostly to the predominant Protestant churches: the first they established was Jeremiah Methodist Church in the mid-1870s in Halifax County. Later some of the congregation left and built the Pine Chapel Baptist Church. While the Reconstruction legislature established public school systems for the first time after the American Civil War, legislators were forced to accept segregated schools to get the bill passed. In the binary system that evolved out of the slave society of the South, especially as whites tried to restore white supremacy after Reconstruction, they classified most mixed-race people of any visible African ancestry as black (colored), although ethnic Indians had traditionally had rights as free people of color for decades before the Civil War. Haliwa-Saponi children were required to go to schools with the children of newly emancipated freedmen. After 1877 and the end of Reconstruction, the Haliwa spent the late 19th century fighting for separate Indian schools. They also organized a more formal tribal governance structure. In the 1870s the Haliwa-Saponi began meeting at Silver Hill, a remote location within the Meadows. With the rise of Jim Crow laws in the late 19th century, the Haliwa-Saponi and African Americans were disfranchised by state law in 1896 and a new constitution in 1899 that was discriminatory in the application of poll taxes, literacy tests and grandfather clauses. This was the pattern for every former Confederate state, beginning with Mississippi in 1890 and proceeding through 1908. The Haliwa continued their efforts to build and maintain separate cultural institutions. These early efforts at formal re- organization resulted in approval by the state for Indian schools: Bethlehem School (1882) in Warren County and the Secret Hill School in Halifax County. Early tribal leaders worked to start the process of reorganizing tribal government and gaining recognition, but in the post-Reconstruction era with the rise of Jim Crow laws, they found little support. In the segregated state, few official records of the period recorded any people as Indian. = Twentieth century = Richardson and Everett note that issues of race and ethnicity became more complex when numerous African-American laborers were recruited in 1906 for a growing timber industry and moved with their families into the Meadows area. By 1908 they started to attend Pine Chapel Baptist Church, but some Haliwa wanted to have separate worship and started a third church, St. Paul's Baptist Church. It had an all-Indian congregation until the 1950s. Later in the twentieth century, the Indian schools closed because segregated public schools were found to be unconstitutional. Tribal leaders in the 1940s, including John C. Hedgepeth, tried to have birth certificates of members indicate their Indian ethnicity, with little success. The state classified people as only black (colored) or white. In 1953, the tribe re- organized its government into the current structure, through the leadership of Hedgepeth, Lonnie Richardson, B.B. Richardson, Chief Jerry Richardson (First Chief under the new governance structure), Percy Richardson (Second Chief under the new governance structure, who also served as the first Vice Chief after the reorganization), with W. R. Richardson the Third Chief of the tribe, James Mills, Theadore Lynch, and others. After the US Supreme Court ruled in Brown vs. The Board of Education (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, the state undertook resistance by what was called the Pearsall Plan, which allowed municipalities to make funds available to create private neighborhood schools. The Haliwa-Saponi took advantage of this provision to build and operate the private Haliwa Indian School, which was attended only by Indian children. It was the only tribally supported Indian school that was not on a reservation. They operated it from 1957-1969. After a few years of its operation, the State Department of Public Instruction (DPI) provided funding for teacher salaries. Tribal citizens paid for supplies and materials, the building, and maintenance, much as parents do at parochial schools. In 1957, the Haliwa Indian Tribe built the Saponi Indian Church, since renamed Mt. Bethel Indian Baptist Church, in Warren County. Sometimes other people of color, resented the Indians' separate ethnic identity within the segregated social system. The increasing African-American activism for civil rights highlighted some of the tensions between the ethnicities. In 1965, North Carolina formally recognized the Haliwa Indian Tribe. In 1967 the Haliwa opened their tenth annual Haliwa Pow-wow to the public, inviting state and local officials and Indians from other states. They added Saponi to the tribal name in 1979 to reflect their Siouan ancestry. The Tribe has since built an updated headquarters administration building, multipurpose building, and instituted various service programs. Programs include but are not limited to tribal housing, daycare, senior citizens program, community services, Workforce Investment Act, cultural retention, after-school and youth programs, energy assistance, and economic development. The Haliwa-Saponi opened a school in 2000, the Haliwa-Saponi Tribal School, 98% of whose students are Indian. The school (which is a public charter school) has a curriculum based on the NC state standard course of study, small classrooms, technology, and American Indian Studies. The Haliwa-Saponi continue to be culturally active. The tribe is proud of the community's many dancers, singers, artists, advanced degree students, and young professionals. = Controversy = In 2011 the Haliwa tribe was audited by the state of North Carolina and found to have submitted an inaccurate grant application. \\"The audit, prompted by a citizen's complaint, alleged false information was included on the tribe's grant application to Golden LEAF for the project.\\" \\"It found the tribe misrepresented itself in saying it had tribal council review and approval for the grant, an approved loan for $700,000 and a $600,000 HUD grant for matching funds, because \\"HUD does not permit the use of its Indian Housing Block Grant funds for projects that have been rejected by a tribe.\\" Testing irregularities in the 2010-11 academic year at Haliwa-Saponi Tribal School resulted in 9 student's Biology test scores being invalidated and Haliwa-Saponi Tribal School Principal Chenoa Davis resigning. Community members expressed concerns related to the investigation during a meeting of the school board. Ronald Richardson, tribal chief of the Haliwa-Saponi, said that the tribe should work out its own problems without newspaper publicity. School board Chairman Gideon Lee declined to identify the teacher in question who downloaded state biology test information, but said that action has been taken against those determined to be involved. When Professor Robert K Thomas visited with the Haliwa in the Summer of 1978, the founders and members never mentioned the word \\"Saponi\\", instead calling their ancestry \\"Cherokee\\". In Cherokee Communities of the South, the only family of Saponi found among North Carolina was the Collins family (unrelated to the Haliwa). \\"Costly mistake: Haliwa-Saponi Tribe loses out on $316,000 due to grant miscues \\".

Roof shingles are a roof covering consisting of individual overlapping elements. These elements are typically flat, rectangular shapes laid in courses from the bottom edge of the roof up, with each successive course overlapping the joints below. Shingles are made of various materials such as wood, slate, flagstone, metal, plastic, and composite materials such as fibre cement and asphalt shingles. Ceramic roof tiles, which still dominate in Europe and some parts of Asia, are still usually called tiles. Roof shingles may deteriorate faster and need to repel more water than wall shingles. They are a very common roofing material in the United States. Etymology Shingle is a corruption of German schindle (schindel) meaning a roofing slate.\\"Shingle\\" def. 1.

Accessed 1/11/2014 Shingles historically were called tiles and shingle was a term applied to wood shingles, as is still mostly the case outside the US. Shingles are laid in courses usually with each shingle offset from its neighbors. The first course is the starter course and the last being a ridge course or ridge slates for a slate roof. The ridge is often covered with a ridge cap, board, piece, or rollPassmore, Augustine C.. Handbook of technical terms used in architecture and building and their allied trades and subjects,. London: Scott, Greenwood, and Co.;, 1904. Print. sometimes with a special ridge vent material. Overview Roof shingles are almost always highly visible and so are an important aspect of a building's aesthetics in patterns, textures and colors. Roof shingles, like other building materials on vernacular buildings, are typically of a material locally available. The type of shingle is taken into account before construction because the material affects the roof pitch and construction method: Some shingles can be installed on lath where others need solid sheathing (sheeting) on the roof deck. All shingle roofs are installed from the bottom upward beginning with a starter course and the edge seams offset to avoid leaks. Many shingle installations benefit from being placed on top of an underlayment material such as asphalt felt paper to prevent leaks even from wind driven rain and snow and ice dams in cold climates. At the ridge the shingles on one side of the roof simply extend past the ridge or there is a ridge cap consisting of boards, copper, or lead sheeting. An asphalt shingle roof has flexible asphalt shingles as the ridge cap. Some roof shingles are non-combustible or have a better fire rating than others which influence their use, some building codes do not allow the use of shingles with less than a class-A fire rating to be used on some types of buildings. Due to increased fire hazard, wood shingles and organic-based asphalt shingles have become less common than fiberglass-based asphalt shingles. No shingles are water-tight so the minimum recommended roof pitch is 4:12 without additional underlayment materials.Kang, Kaffee, and Rob Thallon. Graphic guide to frame construction. Student ed. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1998. 177. Print. Roof shingles of Fitzroya came to be used as money and called \\"Real de Alerce\\". Asphalt shingles In the United States, fiberglass-based asphalt shingles are by far the most common roofing material used for residential roofing applications. In Europe they are called bitumen roof shingles or tile strips, and are much less common. They are easy to install, relatively affordable, last 20 to 60 years and are recyclable in some areas. Asphalt shingles come in a large number of styles and colors. The protective nature of paper and fiberglass asphalt shingles primarily comes from the long-chain petroleum hydrocarbons, while wood shingles are protected by natural oils in the cellulose structure. Over time in the hot sun, these oils soften and when rain falls the oils are gradually washed out of the shingles. During rain, more water is channeled along eaves and complex rooflines, and these are subsequently more prone to erosion than other areas. Eventually the loss of the oils causes asphalt shingle fibers to shrink and wood shingles to rot, exposing the nail heads under the shingles. Once the nail heads are exposed, water running down the roof can seep into the building around the nail shank, resulting in rotting of underlying roof building materials and causing moisture damage to ceilings and paint inside. Wood shingles Heinola Rural Parish church, in Heinola, Finland. It was completed in 1755 and built most likely by August Sorsa. Close-up of the wooden shingle roof. The patterning is said to originate from Islamic architecture. Two basic types of wood shingles are called shingles and shakes. Wood shakes are typically longer and thicker than wood shingles. The main difference is in how they are made, with shingles always being sawn and shakes normally being split, at least on one side. Untreated wood shingles and shakes have long been known as a fire hazard and have been banned in various places, particularly in urban areas where exterior, combustible building materials contribute to devastating fires known as conflagrations. Modern pressure-impregnated fire retardant treated wood shakes and shingles can achieve a Class B fire rating, and can achieve a Class A rating when used in conjunction with specially designed roof assemblies. The use of wooden roof shingles has existed in parts of the world with a long tradition of wooden buildings, especially Scandinavia, and Central and Eastern Europe. Nearly all the houses and buildings in colonial Chilo√© were built with wood, and roof shingles were extensively employed in Chilota architecture. Stone shingles Slate shingles are also called slate tiles, the usual name outside the US. Slate roof shingles are relatively expensive to install but can last 80 to 400 years depending on the quality of the slate used, and how well they are maintained. The material itself deteriorates only slowly, and may be recycled from one building to another. The primary means of failure in a slate roof is when individual slates lose their peg attachment and begin to slide out of place. This can open up small gaps above each slate. A secondary mode of failure is when the slates themselves begin to break up. The lower parts of a slate may break loose, giving a gap below a slate. Commonly the small and stressed area above the nail hole may fail, allowing the slate to slip as before. In the worst cases, a slate may simply break in half and be lost altogether. A common repair to slate roofs is to apply 'torching', a mortar fillet underneath the slates, attaching them to the battens.[1][3] This may applied as either a repair, to hold slipping slates, or pre-emptively on construction. Where slates are particularly heavy, the roof may begin to split apart along the roof line. This usually follows rot developing and weakening the internal timbers, often as a result of poor ventilation within the roofspace. An important aspect to slate roofs is the use of a metal flashing which will last as long as the slates. Slate shingles may be cut in a variety of decorative patterns and are available in several colors. Flagstone shingles are a traditional roofing material. Some stone shingles are fastened in place but some simply are held by gravity so the roof pitch cannot be too steep or the stones will slide off the roof. Sandstone has also been used to make shingles. =Gallery of stone shingles= File:Meerbusch - Lank - Hauptstr 19, Van-Haags-Hof - Detail Dach (3).jpgSlate roofers guild emblem as an ornament made with slate roof shingles, Meerbusch, Germany.

File:DryStoneRoofConstruction.jpgA dry laid stone roof in Switzerland Fibre cement shingles Fibre (fiber) cement shingles are often known by their manufacturer's name such as eternit or transite. Sometimes the fiber in the cement material was asbestos which has been banned for health reasons since the 1980s. Removal of asbestos shingles requires extra precautions and disposal methods. Metal shingles Metal shingles are extremely fire resistant, so are used in fire prone areas. Metal shingles on St John's Church, Tzum, Netherlands 20307447 - RCE Plastic shingles Plastic has been used to produce imitation slate shingles. These are lightweight and durable, but combustible. Also, they are very lightweight and are one of the cheapest shingles to have installed. Companies like Barrington Roof Tiles Australia make Plastic or Composite Roof Shingles  Cedar shingles  Cedar shingles are resistant to rot and commonly available in 18‚Äù and 24‚Äù lengths. These fade gradually from natural wood colored to a silver-like tone. Types include hand-split resawn shakes, tapersplit shakes or tapersawn shakes.[5] See also * Solar shingle * Shingle style * Roof cleaning * Roof tiles, similar in function to shingles, but made of curved terracota panels References Category:Roofs Category:Roof tiles Category:Roofing materials ","title":"Roof shingle"},{"id":"2601204","text":"Spinalonga () is an island located in the Gulf of Elounda in north-eastern Crete, in Lasithi, next to the town of Plaka. The island is further assigned to the area of Kalydon. It is near the Spinalonga peninsula (\\"large Spinalonga\\") ‚Äì which often causes confusion as the same name is used for both. The official Greek name of the island today is Kalydon. During Venetian rule, salt was harvested from salt pans around the island. The island has also been used as a leper colony. Spinalonga has appeared in novels, television series, and a short film.  Origin of the name  Map of Elounda, Spinalonga and surrounding areas. According to Venetian documents, the name of the island originated in the Greek expression œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒïŒªŒøœçŒΩœÑŒ± stin Elounda (meaning \\"to Elounda\\"). The Venetians could not understand the expression so they familiarized it using their own language, and called it spina \\"thorn\\" longa \\"long\\", an expression that was also maintained by the locals. The Venetians were inspired for this expression by the name of an island near Venice called by the same name and which is known today as the island of Giudecca. History Because of its position the island was fortified from its earliest years in order to protect the entranceway of the port of Ancient Olous. =Arab raids= Olous, and accordingly the wider region, were depopulated at the middle of the 7th century because of the raids of the Arab pirates in the Mediterranean. Olous remained deserted until the mid-15th century when the Venetians began to construct salt-pans in the shallow and salty waters of the gulf. Subsequently, the region acquired commercial value and became inhabited. This, in combination with the emergent Turkish threat, particularly after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, and the continuous pirate raids, forced the Venetians to fortify the island. =Venetian rule= Map of Spinalonga fortress by Francesco Basilicata, 1618. In 1578 the Venetians charged the engineer Genese Bressani to plan the island's fortifications. He created blockhouses at the highest points of the northern and southern side of the island, as well as a fortification ring along the coast that closed out any hostile disembarkation. In 1579, the Provveditore generale di Candia, Luca Michiel, put the foundation stone of the fortifications, built over the ruins of an acropolis. There are two inscriptions that cite this event, one on the transom of the main gate of the castle and the other on the base of the rampart at the north side of the castle. In 1584, the Venetians, realising that the coastal fortifications were easy to conquer by the enemies attacking from the nearby hills, decided to strengthen their defense by constructing new fortifications at the top of the hill. The Venetian fire would thus have bigger range, rendering Spinalonga an impregnable sea fortress, one of the most important in the Mediterranean basin. Spinalonga, along with Gramvousa and Souda, remained in Venetian hands even after the rest of Crete fell to the Ottomans in the Cretan War (1645‚Äì1669) and until 1715, when they fell to the Ottomans during the last Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War.Maltezou, Crete under Venetian rule, p. 159 These three forts defended Venetian trade routes and were also useful bases in the event of a new Venetian-Turkish war for Crete.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 343 Many Christians found refuge in these fortresses to escape persecution from the Ottoman Turks. Island of Spinalonga =Ottoman rule= In 1715, the Ottoman Turks captured Spinalonga taking over the last remaining Venetian fortress and removing the last trace of Venetian military presence from the island of Crete.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 338 =Cretan revolt= At the end of the Ottoman occupation the island, together with the fort at Ierapetra, was the refuge of many Ottoman families that feared Christian reprisals.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 385 After the revolution of 1866 other Ottoman families came to the island from all the region of Mirabello. During the Cretan revolt of 1878, only Spinalonga and the fortress at Ierapetra were not taken by the Christian Cretan insurgents.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 406 In 1881 the 1112 Ottomans formed their own community and later, in 1903, the last Turks left the island. =20th-century leper colony= Spinalonga in 1901 by Giuseppe Gerola The island was subsequently used as a leper colony from 1903 to 1957. The last inhabitant, a priest, did not leave the island till 1962, in order to maintain the Greek Orthodox tradition of commemorating a buried person 40 days, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years after their death. There were two entrances to Spinalonga, one being the lepers entrance, a tunnel known as \\"Dante's Gate\\". This was so named because the patients did not know what was going to happen to them once they arrived. However, once on the island they received food, water, medical attention and social security payments. Previously, such amenities had been unavailable to Crete's leprosy patients, as they mostly lived in the area's caves, away from civilization. After the leper colony was dissolved, Spinalonga sank into oblivion; interest in it was revived by the work of people like Maurice Born.Remoundakis and Born, Vies et Morts d'un Cr√©tois l√©preux. Spinalonga was one of the last active leper colonies in Europe; others that have survived Spinalonga include Tichile≈üti in eastern Romania, Fontilles in Spain and Talsi in Latvia. As of 2002, few lazarettos remain in Europe.  Spinalonga today  A view of the Venetian fortifications Today, the uninhabited island is a popular tourist attraction in Crete. In addition to the abandoned leper colony and the fortress, Spinalonga is known for its small pebble beaches and shallow waters. The island can easily be accessed from Plaka, Elounda and Agios Nikolaos. Tourist boats depart from all three towns on a daily basis (every 30 minutes from Elounda). Since there is no accommodation on Spinalonga, the tours last only a few hours. Spinalonga is under consideration to become a World Heritage Site. In popular culture West bank of Spinalonga Spinalonga featured in the 1977 British television series Who Pays the Ferryman? and Werner Herzog's experimental short film Last Words. It is the (unnamed) setting of Ali Smith's short story The Touching of Wood (in Free Love and Other Stories, 1995). It is also the setting for the 2005 novel The Island by Victoria Hislop, the story of a family's ties to the leper colony; the book was adapted for television in the television series To Nisi by Mega Channel Greece.Mega takes on ‚ÄòThe Island‚Äô The short story \\"Spinalonga\\" by John Ware, about a tourist group that visits the island, was included in the 13th Pan Book of Horror.

It was first released in Japan in 1990, and internationally a year later. Being short for \\"Rotate 360\\", the R360 is noteworthy for its ability to spin 360 degrees in any direction on two metal axis, allowing the player to freely move as the cabinet mimics the in-game action, including the ability to turn completely upside down. A safety bar and four-point safety harness are utilized to keep players in the seat as the machine moves. An emergency stop button is also present both inside the machine and on the attendant tower. Designed by Sega AM2, the R360 was part of the company's movement in creating attraction-like games for Japanese amusement centers. Only two compatible games were produced: G-LOC: Air Battle in 1990, and Wing War in 1994. An R360 unit demonstrating Rad Mobile was demonstrated in Japan, but was never publicly released. The cabinet was commercially unsuccessful, with only an estimated 100 units being produced and fewer being sold. Critics commended the R360 for its unique and technologically-advanced concept, with one critic saying it helped represent Sega's massive presence in the arcade industry. A successor, the R360Z, was released in 2015 for Transformers: Human Alliance, which can seat two players. Technical specifications The R360 was designed by Sega AM2. Its name is short for \\"Rotate 360\\", representative of the cabinet's ability to spin 360 degrees in any direction. Physically, the unit is in diameter and tall. It weighs over , and utilizes a 20-inch (51 cm) monitor for gameplay. The cabinet is mounted on a gyroscope that can rotate along two axes, attached to a base which is stationery. A safety bar and four-point safety harness are utilized to keep players in the seat as the machine moves. Additionally, light sensors would stop the machine if a player extended an arm or leg outside the cabinet; this feature caused an issue if the R360 sat in direct sunlight. Two emergency stop buttons are present; one is inside the arcade cabinet and the second is on an attendant tower. A sensor grid triggers an alarm if the cabinet is approached while the game is in motion. While the attendant tower and the cabinet itself of the R360 featured coin slots, arcade operators were strongly warned not to allow the game to be played without an attendant and the safety fence, for fear of someone losing a limb or being killed from the moving machine. Attendants were also necessary if the emergency stop features were triggered; a button on the attendant tower would allow them to reset the machine and prevent players from being stuck upside down. By Sega's recommendation, players are barred from using the R360 if they have heart conditions, are intoxicated, pregnant, have high or low blood pressure, have been advised against strenuous activity, or have \\"mental or physical problems.\\"  History  The R360 was first tested in Sega's Tokyo arcades in early 1990, and given a broader release later that year. It was advertised in Sega Visions in the US as early as winter 1990-91 and exhibited at the UK Amusement Trades Exhibition International in 1991. Sega initially classified the game as a ride, and included G-LOC: Air Battle as the included game. Players were capable of playing the game or simply selecting \\"experience\\" to ride the cabinet as the game ran through its demo mode. G-LOC: Air Battle operates on the Sega Y Board for its arcade system board. An R360 unit playing Rad Mobile was demonstrated in Japan, but never confirmed to have a release. An additional release for the cabinet came in 1994 with Wing War, a Model 1 arcade board release. Wing War for the R360 required two cabinets to be linked. According to The One, the R360 cost \\"over ¬£70,000\\" in 1991, while R360 collector Kevin Keinert placed the price at $90,000 or more. This meant only the largest arcade operators could afford the machine. The Funland Arcade in the Trocadero Complex charged ¬£3 per ride in 1991; in the United States, the play price varied between $3 and $5. Additional costs to the machine came in repairs. Sega did not include schematics with the R360, and the cabinet's circuitry was complex and prone to failure. Sega stopped manufacturing the R360 within a few years. No official figure on how many cabinets were sold has been released; according to Keinert, contact with Sega has been returned with calling that number a \\"company secret\\". He estimates that between 100 and 200 units were made. In 2015, Sega introduced a motion simulator attraction based on its arcade game Transformers: Human Alliance at Joypolis. The attraction utilizes a new version of the R360, labeled as \\"R360Z\\", which seats two passengers. Reception British gaming magazine The One reviewed the R360 in 1991, playing G-LOC: Air Battle, and begins their review by expressing that \\"what the R360 delivers is the greatest sensory overload you are ever likely to get without taking your trousers off ... this is a unit that will turn your whole idea of what a coin-op is upside-down.\\" The One noted that the R360 made them nausious from motion sickness, but despite this they excitedly stated that the R360's gameplay is \\"an experience!!!\\" Cash Box were enamored by the machine's unique concept and capabilities, exclaiming: \\"This is not just a video game, it is a video experience which will make your heart pound and adrenalin flow as you engage in high speed air battle and dog fighting!\\" Video game journalist Ken Horowitz called the R360's existence a notable one for its demonstrating Sega's desire to create bigger and more realistic games. Retrospectively in 2019, Retro Gamer said that the R360 helped represent Sega's massive presence in the arcade game market for its unique and interesting idea, writing that it is \\"the pinnacle of what could be achieved in videogames at the time and shows the dominance Sega had in the industry.\\" References Category:Arcade hardware Category:Sega hardware ","title":"R360"},{"id":"2601215","text":"Natalie Davis may refer to: *Natalie Zemon Davis, American historian *Natalie Davis, known as The Miniature Killer, a fictional serial killer from U.S. TV series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation *Natalie Davis, 2011 Miss Minnesota winner ","title":"Natalie Davis"},{"id":"2601222","text":"Brodie system on a Piper L4 The Brodie landing system was a method of landing light aeroplane devised by James H Brodie, a Captain of the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. The method of landing involved catching a hook attached to the plane with a sling which itself was attached to a cable. This system proved useful in landing aircraft in normally unsuitable terrain, such as the jungle or in mountains, and also afforded good camouflage. After tests on land the system was first tested in September 1943 for shipboard use with an installation on the motor ship . Staff Sergeant R. A. Gregory made ten good takeoffs and hookups with a Stinson L-5 light plane. Similar non-conventional landing apparatus were previously deployed in limited numbers for airborne aircraft recovery on the 1930s US Navy dirigibles to retrieve small fighters. The Brodie system differed in that the system was based on a wire capture with a larger (longer) target to hit by the pilot. Even though it could be mounted to moving objects, it was also suitable for fixed installations in the jungle. Brodie was issued US Patent # 2, 435,197, # 2,488,050, # 2,488,051, # 3,163,380 for variations of the landing system. The system was also used for landing light aircraft on ships, allowing existing ships to be converted to light aircraft carriers with little structural changes. Brodie and test pilot Flight Officer Raymond Gregory were awarded the Legion of Merit for their work on the system in 1945. Brodie envisioned scaling the system up to capture planes as heavy as 7000 lbs.

Burton. Terry Burton (born 8 November 1952 in Camden Town, North London) is an English football manager and coach, who was most recently assistant manager at Reading. Burton started his career at Arsenal and was the captain of Arsenal's FA Youth Cup winning team in 1971, before later beginning his coaching career at the club and going on to have further backroom spells at Wimbledon, Watford, Cardiff City and West Bromwich Albion. Playing career Burton's playing career started as an Arsenal apprentice where he captained the 1971 FA Youth Cup winning team. He wasn't offered a professional contract and joined Folkestone during the summer of 1971. He went on to play for Epping Town, Hayes and Leyton Wingate (as player-coach). Towards the end of the 1970s he coached football at Holloway School. Coaching career =Arsenal= Burton returned to Arsenal as youth team coach in 1979. During his spell at the club, he was noted for having brought through future Arsenal and England captain Tony Adams, who was later linked with wanting to bring Burton to Portsmouth as his assistant having been appointed the club's manager in 2008. Following Don Howe's appointment as Arsenal manager, he was promoted to first team coach, then reserve team coach in 1986 when George Graham became Arsenal manager, though was released for the second time by the club in 1987. =Wimbledon= After three months managing non-league Wealdstone Burton was appointed reserve team coach at Wimbledon. He subsequently held the positions of Youth Team manager, Assistant Manager under Joe Kinnear (during which time the club achieved 3 top ten finishes in the Premier League and reached both the League Cup and FA Cup semi-finals), Technical Director and Academy Director at the club before he was temporarily charged with managing the first team after the Norwegian Egil Olsen's dismissal with only two games remaining of the club's 1999‚Äì2000 Premiership campaign, given the task of keeping Wimbledon in the Premier League. A last minute goal from John Hartson against Aston Villa at Selhurst Park in Burton's first game in charge gave the Dons hope of staying up as long as they matched the result of Bradford City against Liverpool in the final game of the year. A defeat at Southampton on the final day of the season, and a shock 1‚Äì0 win at Valley Parade for Bradford meant that Wimbledon's fight against relegation was lost. Despite this, during pre-season Burton was given the role of first team manager permanently. Managerial career Wimbledon achieved respectable top-ten finishes in both of their first two seasons outside the top flight since 1985‚Äì86, playing a short passing game, rather than the long-ball the Dons were well known for, but never really made a serious promotion challenge. Although he was popular with the club's fans, Burton incurred the wrath of the chairman after speaking out against the club's proposed relocation to Milton Keynes, and he was promptly sacked just after the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season. He was replaced by goalkeeping coach Stuart Murdoch. =Watford= Burton spent two years with Watford as assistant manager to Ray Lewington. His role at Vicarage Road had begun during the summer of 2002, shortly after he was sacked as manager of Wimbledon. =Cardiff City= Burton joined Cardiff as assistant manager during the 2004‚Äì2005 season, during Lennie Lawrence's spell at the club. He has been credited at Cardiff for having brought through Aaron Ramsey, and helped recommend Ramsey to Arsenal manager Ars√®ne Wenger, having retained a longstanding connection to the club. During transfer negotiations in the 2008‚Äì2009 season, Burton also advised that Ramsey join Arsenal, citing the similarity between the player and the club's overall style of play. On 30 May 2011, Dave Jones was sacked and a month later, Burton was placed on gardening leave under new boss, Malky Mackay. =West Bromwich Albion= Following his leave from Cardiff City, Burton joined West Bromwich Albion as first team coach until the end of the season, on 7 December 2011. =Sheffield Wednesday= On 5 March 2012, Terry Burton was confirmed as Sheffield Wednesday's Assistant manager to once again be reunited with Dave Jones. =Arsenal= On 5 July 2012, it was announced that Burton was to become Arsenal's new Reserves & Head Development coach, replacing Neil Banfield, who took Pat Rice's role as first-team coach following the Irishman's retirement at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. As part of his role, Burton managed the club's reserve team as well as overseeing the club's progress in the 2012‚Äì13 NextGen Series. =Return To West Bromwich Albion= On 13 May 2014, it was announced that Burton was to return to West Bromwich Albion as the new Technical Director replacing previous Technical Director; Richard Garlick.

By its own definition, it is a club for \\"graduate and professional women of varied backgrounds and interests\\". Members include lawyers, scientists, writers and musicians, as well as businesswomen. The club house is located at 2 Audley Square, on South Audley Street, Mayfair, London. History The club was founded in 1883 by Gertrude Jackson of Girton College, Cambridge. In January 1887, the (then) University Club for Ladies opened its premises at 31 Bond Street. By 1894, the location was not large enough to serve the purposes of the growing club and it expanded by moving to new premises at Maddox Street. By 1904, the Club had moved to 4 George Street, Hanover Square where a number of bedrooms were available and by 1913, membership had grown to 800 members. The club now has almost 1,000 members. After the Great War, the Club was again looking for new premises and, after a lengthy search, the freehold of 2 Audley Square ‚Äì the Club's permanent home today ‚Äì was purchased in 1921. At the same time, the Club adopted its current name, the University Women's Club. The house was built by Lord Arthur Russell in the 1840s to house his large family. The terrace and garden are now planted with green, white and violet plants, the colours associated with the Suffragette movement. A large London plane tree stands in the middle of the garden, probably originally planted in the grounds of Chesterfield House. The Club today Today, the University Women's Club is the only women's club in the UK to be wholly owned and managed by its Members. Its event schedule includes many dinners and other social events. In March 2014, Fiona Lazareff, a member of the committee, launched the annual Techpreneurs Awards on behalf of the club. The Club has close ties with the East India Club who occasionally co-organise functions for members of both clubs. Members of the club pay an initial joining fee and an annual subscription.

(1994). Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 352 ‚Äì 353. The clan does not currently have a chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms and therefore it is considered an Armigerous clan. History =Origins of the clan= Traditional origins According to the legend and tradition, the first of the name Armstrong was Siward Beorn (sword warrior), who was also known as Siward Digry (sword strong arm). He was said to be the last Anglo-Danish Earl of Northumberland and a nephew of King Canute, the Danish king of England who reigned until 1035. Recorded origins The Armstrong name was common over the whole of Northumbria and the Scottish Borders. The Armstrongs became a powerful and warlike clan in Liddesdale and the Debatable Lands. Historian George Fraser Black lists Adam Armstrong in 1235 as being pardoned for causing the death of another man. Black also records Gilbert Armstrong, steward of the household of David II of Scotland, as ambassador to England in 1363. =15th, 16th and 17th centuries= Armstrong tartan In around 1425 John Armstrong, brother of Armstrong of Mangerton in Liddesdale built a strong tower. The Armstrongs were able to raise three thousand horsemen and were said to be at one point in control of the debatable lands. In 1528, Lord Dacre, who was the English Warden of the Marches, attacked the Armstrongs' tower but the Armstrongs retaliated and burned Netherby. The power of the Armstrongs was seen by James V of Scotland as a threat to his own authority. According to tradition, James tricked John Armstrong of Gilnockie to a meeting at Hawick where the king hanged the Armstrong laird without further ado. King James continued his treatment of the Armstrongs when they failed to support him in 1542 at the Battle of Solway Moss. In 1603 the Union of the Crowns brought an official end to the Anglo-Scottish Wars of the Borders. In 1610 the last of the Armstrong lairds was hanged in Edinburgh for leading a raid on Penrith, England. This was followed by a ruthless campaign by the Crown to pacify the Borders. As a result, families were scattered with many of them seeking new homes in Ulster, particularly in County Fermanagh. Armstrong is now amongst the fifty most common names in Ulster. There has been no trace of the Armstrong chiefs since the clan was dispersed in the 17th century. =Modern clan history= Amongst the many distinguished Armstrongs are Sir Alexander Armstrong who was an Arctic explorer, and also Neil Armstrong who was the first man to walk upon the Moon, taking with him a piece of the Clan Armstrong tartan.Goddard, Jacqui (20 July 2009). 40 years on Armstrong recalls 'step for mankind'.

Although there has been no trace of the Armstrong chiefs since the clan was dispersed in the 17th century, there is a powerful and active clan association and the Clan Armstrong Trust was established in 1978. Castles Gilnockie Tower, a Clan Armstrong tower Castles owned by the Clan Armstrong have included amongst many others: *Gilnockie Tower, also known as Hollows Tower, a couple of miles north of Canonbie in Dumfriesshire.Coventry, Martin. (2008). Castles of the Clans: The Strongholds and Seats of 750 Scottish Families and Clans. pp. 14 ‚Äì 15. . It was apparently built in 1518 but there was probably an earlier stronghold on the site. It now houses a Clan Armstrong Centre. *Mangerton Tower, one mile south of Newcastleton, which is near to the English border. Nearby is the Minholm Cross, which was erected in about 1320 to commemorate the murder of Alexander Armstrong in Hermitage Castle. Gaelic It is unknown if any of the early Armstrongs spoke Gaelic, but Gaelic-derived place names such as Auchenrivock can be found in the Esk River valley, and the language persisted in Galloway, Carrick and the Western Borders well into the seventeenth century, so it is possible.Lorimer, W. L. (1949) \\"The Persistence of Gaelic in Galloway and Carrick.\\"Scottish Gaelic Studies 6(2), pp. 114‚Äì136. The name of the Armstrong stronghold itself, Gilnockie, is from the Scottish Gaelic Geal Cnocan meaning 'Little White Hill'. The Armstrong name is sometimes rendered in Gaelic as follows: * MacGhilliel√†idir (Surname) * Clann 'icGhillel√†idir (Collective) These Gaelic names appear frequently in modern clan literature, but they are neologistic and are rarely used by Gaelic speakers. However, Armstrong has been historically associated with the Ulster Gaelic name, Mac Tr√©an-Labhraidh, a branch of the √ì Labhradha family. Tr√©an- Labhradh means strong-speaking but it is thought that the name was misunderstood as meaning strong-arm, and Armstrong was adopted as a convenient Anglicization.Matheson, Robert E. (1901) Varieties and Synonyms of Surnames and Christian Names in Ireland. Dublin: Stationery Office, pg. 10. Mac Tr√©an- Labhraidh would translate as Mac Treun-Labhraidh in Scottish Gaelic. Other common associated names include variations on Traynor, Treanor, Trainor, McCreanor, MacCrainor; which all derive from the Irish Gaelic name, Mac Threinfhir, meaning son of the strong man. After the Plantation of Ulster many Armstrongs (mainly those who were Catholic) adopted the Traynor surname. Among the best-known Gaelic-speaking Armstrongs was Dr Robert Armstrong of Perthshire, who compiled an authoritative early Gaelic-English dictionary, published in 1825.John Reid (1832) Bibliotheca Scoto-Celtica.

The overhead, action-adventure format is similar to Zombies Ate My Neighbors. Up to two players each take on the role of one of three ancient Greek heroes: Herc (Hercules), Atlanta (Atalanta), or Jason, who are on a quest to defeat Hades and save the goddess of nature, Persephone. In 2014, it was released for PSN in North America. Herc's Adventures was originally announced as a Sega Saturn exclusive with a release date of December 1996, but delays pushed its release back to July 1997. The PlayStation version was released internationally, while the Saturn version was exclusive to North America. Virgin Interactive had planned to release the Saturn version in Europe in September 1997, but it was dropped from the release schedule as part of Virgin's withdrawal of support for the Saturn.  Gameplay  The characters pick up various weapons and items, which include: pepper breath against bees and wasps, frost breath that freezes enemies, lightning which blasts a target with electrical energy, spears, boar traps, flaming spears (used against the Hydra to prevent its head from reforming), bombs, an evil Pandora's box which when opened releases rough weather, a shrink doll which miniaturizes any target and a laser gun. Items include Circe's potion which turned the player into a pig to fit into small crevices, Medusa and Minotaur's head, and the golden fleece (which opens the gates of Hades' underworld). Gyros increase the player's health bar, and each hero has a second strength bar that depletes whenever moving or picking up an object. Health and strength are increased by buying lessons from a strength trainer or finding red hearts. Every time the players die, they are sent down to the underworld and need to fight their way to the exit in order to continue. The more they die, the further back into the underworld they are sent, making it increasingly harder to fight their way out. Dying five times results in a game over. With the exception of the switch to and from the underworld section, the game world is presented as an open, singular map, without any loading screens or interstitials between areas.

The more mixed reviews found some faults with the gameplay. Next Generation opined that the gameplay is too one-note and that the skewed perspective sometimes creates confusion about where the player character can go, though the reviewer still concluded that the game is fun enough and different enough to be enjoyable. IGN criticized only the fact that the game is not a polygon-based fighting game or racing game, remarking that it was exceptionally good for a game that did not fall into either of those genres. Most critical commentary on the gameplay was positive, however, with several critics commenting that the cooperative two-player mode is especially fun. Shawn Smith of Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that \\"the gameplay is flawless.\\" Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot summed up that \\"The graphics, gameplay, and humor make a unique mix that results in a truly fresh title unlike most of the other games on the market today.\\" Major Mike gave the Saturn version a perfect 5.0 out of 5 in all four GamePro categories (graphics, sound, control, and funfactor), noting in particular the excellent incorporation of mythological figures. He gave the PlayStation version a 4.5 out of 5 in all four categories, but did not directly compare it to the Saturn version, and Rubenstein gave the two versions identical scores.

Badaguan is made up of streets named after great military forts of the ancient times. It was originally a residential area for the Germans built when Qingdao was a German protectorate (1897-1914). Each street is lined with a single species of tree and many street names are colloquially known by the trees that line them.(\\"China Connection Tours\\") Along the streets are houses built in a variety of European architectural styles. Badaguan is bordered on the west by No. 1 Beach and on the east by No. 3 Beach. Badaguan is a popular destination for wedding photography. One can often see dozens of newlywed-couples being photographed along Badaguan's shoreline and greenspace. Next to Badaguan, on the south end of No. 2 Beach, is a large rocky outcropping on which a stone Russian villa was constructed. Built in 1932, Huashi Lou () combines Greek, Gothic, and Gothic influences throughout its five storey hulk. It is constructed from marble and stone and features a large turret and a multicolored outer face which inspired the locals' nickname for the structure, \\"the colorful rock building\\".(\\"China Holidays\\") It also contains a passageway which Chiang Kai-shek used to get from the building to the seashore.

The group released three moderately successful full-length albums and toured in support of noted punk and alternative rock groups, including Green Day, Ash, and Supergrass. They reformed in 2013 under the China Drum moniker. History =Early years, Goosefair (1989‚Äì1996)= China Drum were formed in rural Northern England in 1989 by brothers Bill and Dave McQueen, a guitarist and bassist respectively, and singing drummer Adam Lee. Then teenagers, the members first began rehearsing in a local farm's empty pig shed powered by an electrical generator.TMT #15, interview by Mat Honner. March 1995. After four years of extensive local and regional gigging, the band self-released their debut single, \\"Simple\\", in 1993, which was championed by John Peel and other members of the British radio press. They were also heartened when Frankie Stubbs and his influential punk band Leatherface received the single warmly and covered the B-side track \\"Meaning\\" on their \\"Little White God\\" single the following year. The \\"Great Fire\\" single was issued later in 1994 by the London-based Fluffy Bunny Records imprint before a UK tour with Green Day which also included an Amsterdam date, their first international gig. Green Day remained supporters of the group, and bassist Mike Dirnt can be seen wearing a China Drum t-shirt in the music video for their successful single \\"When I Come Around\\". Over the next two years, China Drum released the Barrier EP and numerous smaller releases, many of which received national support from such outlets as BBC Radio One. The band soon signed with Mantra, a subsidiary of Beggars Banquet Europe and Japan, and MCA Records in the United States, who issued a reworked version of the Barrier EP. They released their debut album, Goosefair, on 26 April 1996. The album peaked at No 53 on the UK Albums Chart and received good critical reception, with AllMusic critic Jack Rabid calling the material a mix of \\"wild catchy pop and charged rock and roll\\" and Hybrid Magazine's Tom Topkoff praising the group for its heavy pop prowess. Extensive international touring followed in support of the album, including dates in North America, Bosnia, and Sarajevo,The Big Takeover #40. 1997. and shared bills with Ash and Supergrass. Their breakthrough hit came via a high-tempo cover version of Kate Bush's \\"Wuthering Heights\\", which received its first wide release as the B-Side to Goosefair's lead single, \\"Can't Stop These Things\\". This inaugurated the band's practice of recording punk versions of pop songs: they later recorded Crowded House's \\"Fall at Your Feet\\" in a similar vein, and the theme tune to the television programme The Adventures of Rupert Bear also became a fan favourite at concerts. =Self Made Maniac, Diskin; breakup (1998‚Äì2000)= They released their second album, Self Made Maniac on 24 April 1997, via the Beggars Banquet imprint the following year. The album received mixed critical reception: while The Washington Post critic Mark Jenkins praised the record's balance of classic British rock and modern punk,\\"CHINA DRUM Self Made Maniac Mantra/Beggars Banquet; FOAM Big Windshield Little Mirror Epic\\". The Washington Post, 13 March 1998. Dean Carlson noted via AllMusic that the band's sound had \\"ripened\\" but now lacked \\"fervor and melody\\". In 1998 the group added former Compulsion drummer Jan Alkema to their live lineup, freeing Lee to act exclusively as lead vocalist during concerts. The group promoted Alkema to full-time member status and renamed themselves The Drum in 1999, while also introducing elements of alternative rock and electronic music into their new sound. They released the Diskin album via Mantra Records in this incarnation the following year. Diskin's change of musical direction polarized fans and received lukewarm critical reviews, with NME noting the uneven results of the experimentation and awarding the album five out of ten stars. After being dropped by Mantra and embarking upon a poorly received tour in support of Suicidal Tendencies, The Drum ultimately disbanded in September 2000 due to financial and personal considerations. The McQueen brothers later played together in Servo, while Alkema formed Driven to Collision and Lee the indie rock group Sickhoose. Following their breakup, China Drum retained a cult following and continued to influence other bands: the Australian group Bodyjar, for example, covered \\"Fall Into Place\\" on their 2001 album You Got Me a Girl's Bike You Idiot. =Reunion (2013‚Äì2014)= In 2013 the band reformed with a line up including Lee, the McQueen brothers, and new members John Steel on guitar and Kate Stephenson on drums. Returning to the China Drum moniker and focusing mostly on early material, they played their first gig after reuniting at The Garage in London on 21 February with support by Midway Still and Vanilla Pod. Further concerts followed thereafter, starting with Newcastle University Students' Union on 10 May and a subsequent tour of the United Kingdom. The band released the \\"Water\\" single in October 2014. They played dates without Bill McQueen in 2014, and entered a hiatus thereafter. They resumed playing live in March 2018.

It first had an introduction by BBC who announced: > \\"We won't be signing off until the world ends. We'll be on, we'll be > covering it live, and that will be our last, last event. We'll play the > royal anthem for one time on the middle of November, at that's all.

Its schedule consists of some locally made programs in Hong Kong as well as news programmes from STAR News, it signed an agreement with CNN International News it allowing its access to that channel's programming. It also relayed Seputar Indonesia news programme from Indonesian free-to-air terrestrial television channel's RCTI which is also available in Hong Kong. STAR TV is the based in Hong Kong via based satellite operator, will buy 20 percent of the national network BBC World Service Television giving it a firmer foothold in Asia first most populous country at a time when the British international news television advertising market is booming. STAR TV pay television services are already available on satellite in Southeast Asia. Following STAR TV acquisition by Rupert Murdoch an owner by News Corporation, STAR TV BBC World Service Television Asia was removed from the satellite beam that broadcast into Hong Kong on 1 March 1994. In mid-1994, there was a commercial dispute between BBC World Service Television and STAR TV, where the proposed joint venture by the latter was inconclusive and News Corporation didn't pay for the support and services that BBC News provided after over 3 years. As a result, their license for using the name BBC Television would initially expire. At British Broadcasting Corporations request, the deadline was extended twice from 1 February and finally on 30 April 1994. Following that, Rupert Murdoch is asking for a compensation of about HK$102.5 trillion (US$250 million) from the said company. This situation is said to benefit new look and rebranded which may become the next service that completely replaces BBC News. The dispute also caused BBC World Service Television to lose its monopoly to broadcast the STAR News. BBC World Service Television was removed on BBC Television (handover form BBC) ceased support toward News Corporation, consequently suspending STAR TV operations indefinitely reprivatised from the United Kingdom (Great Britain) and reorganised to split into 2-stations: it screened both English and Chinese movie premiere with split into 1-stations of led \\"STAR Movies\\" with both movie premiere satellite channels a subsidiary of STAR TV & member of News Corporation on 1 May 1994 at 00:00 HKT such: # \\"Fox Movies Video on Demand (was formerly known as STAR Movies)\\" ‚Äì is a 24-hours in daily of Hollywood (English) movie channel based in the Hong Kong was backed by 20th Century Fox is a major American film studios a member of the MPAA. # \\"STAR Chinese Movies (was formerly known as STAR Movies)\\" ‚Äì is a 24-hours in daily of Asian (Chinese) movie channel based in the Republic of China (Taiwan) were still copyrighted form Hong Kong with studio by STAR TV Filmed Entertainment, produced by Fortune STAR Entertainment & distributed by Media Asia Entertainment Group based in Kowloon Peninsula on 1993. =BBC World and BBC Prime= The BBC's international operations initially consisted of a single channel ‚Äì BBC World Service Television. On Thursday, 26 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT this was split into two television stations: * Launched Monday, 16 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT: 24-hour English free-to-air terrestrial international news channel named \\"BBC World\\" (now BBC World News). * Launched Monday, 30 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT: 24-hour English subscription lifestyle, variety & entertainment channel named \\"BBC Prime\\" (now BBC Entertainment). The organisation subsequently launched localised stations focused on a particular area, such as BBC Food (Scandinavia) and BBC America alongside BBC World and BBC Prime. In October 2006, BBC Entertainment replaced BBC Prime in Asian markets, and went on to replace it in other territories during the period 2007‚Äì2009. Other channels that were rolled out internationally included BBC Knowledge and BBC Lifestyle, and an international version of CBeebies. The aim of the new launches was to simplify and diversify the BBC Worldwide offering in the digital age. These launches absorbed some channels, such as BBC Food (into BBC Lifestyle), though channels focused on a particular local market (such as BBC America or BBC Persian TV) continued. =BBC World News= On 21 April 2008, BBC World was renamed \\"BBC World News\\" and new graphics were produced by the Lambie-Nairn design agency, accompanied by reworked music from David Lowe as part of a ¬£550,000 rebranding of the BBC's news output and visual identity.

It is part of the university's Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division Around 250 people work in the Department of Materials full-time, including professors, lecturers, independent fellows, researchers and support staff. There are around 30 academic staff positions of which four are Chairs. The Isaac Wolfson Chair in Metallurgy was set up in the late 1950s and remains one of the most important professorships in British materials science. Professor Sir Peter Hirsch formerly held the chair. The current holder of the chair is Peter Bruce FRS. Other Chairs in the Department include the Vesuvius Chair of Materials held by Patrick Grant FREng, Professor in the Physical Examination of Materials formerly held by David Cockayne FRS and the James Martin Chair in Energy Materials held by James Marrow. Oxford Materials is a research intensive department, achieving 6* status in a research assessment exercise. World leading research is done in the broad fields of structural and nuclear materials, device materials, polymers and biomaterials, nanomaterials, processing and manufacturing, characterization, and computational materials modelling. The Department offers undergraduate degrees in Materials Science and Materials, Economics and Management, having around 100 undergraduates, and around 75 postgraduate students, particularly DPhil students pursuing advanced research.Materials: Oxford University Graduate Studies Prospectus In addition to its own buildings, the Department shares 7 buildings with the Department of Engineering Science on a triangular plot with Banbury Road to the west and Parks Road to the east. In addition, the Department has extensive, large-scale facilities at Begbroke Science Park, north of the city, which was purchased and founded on behalf of the University by Professor Brian Cantor when he was Head of the Department in the 1990s. History The Department of Metallurgy was founded in the mid 1950s by Professor Hume-Rothery. In the early 1950s, Hume-Rothery was a Reader in Metallurgy in the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, and Metallurgy was taught as an option in the Chemistry degree. In rapid succession, during the second half of the 1950s, the Wolfson Chair in Metallurgy was established, Hume-Rothery was appointed as the first Wolfson Professor, an independent Department of Metallurgy was set up with a grant from the General Board, a separate final honours school in Metallurgy was established, the first students entered the course in 1960. The department was initially housed in a hut in Keble Road, until new accommodation, the Hume- Rothery building was completed in 1960. Since then, the department has gradually expanded into a total of almost 8,000 sq m, distributed over 7 buildings in the Keble Road Triangle, just north of the city centre. In December 1999, it acquired another 6,500 sq m, distributed over more than 10 buildings at the (subsequently renamed) Oxford University Begbroke Science Park (OUBSP), 5 miles away, just north of the ring road, half occupied by the departments industry-linked research, and half occupied by high-tech spin-out materials related companies. At first the Metallurgy course was heavily based on Chemistry, but gradually the Chemistry input decreased, and it is now quite small. The Metallurgy degree was substantially revamped in the late 1960s, following Professor Hume-Rotherys retirement. At that time the course and the department were both renamed Metallurgy and the Science of Materials (MSOM). The degree was again substantially revamped in the mid-1990s, following Professor Hirschs retirement. At this time the department was renamed Materials and the course was renamed Materials Science in 2001. A second degree course in Metallurgy, Economics and Management, later renamed Materials, Economics and Management (MEM) was introduced in the mid 1970s in response to the government‚Äôs Dainton report, which was aimed at increasing management studies at UK universities. MEM was effectively an option within MSOM and the two degrees shared a common intake and common first year teaching. A third degree, Engineering and Materials (EMS) was introduced in the late 1980s in response to another government initiative, in this case designed to enhance technology teaching at UK universities. EMS was effectively an option within Engineering, sharing a common intake and common first year teaching with the three other Engineering degrees available at Oxford. The EMS course was phased out mid-2000s and the MEM course was phased out in the mid-2010s.

Wood shingles are thin, tapered pieces of wood primarily used to cover roofs and walls of buildings to protect them from the weather. Historically shingles were split from straight grained, knot free bolts of wood. Today shingles are mostly made by being cut which distinguishes them from shakes which are made by being split out of a bolt. Wooden shingle roofs were prevalent in the North American colonies (for example in the Cape-Cod-style house), while in central and southern Europe at the same time, thatch, slate and tile were the prevalent roofing materials. In rural Scandinavia, wood shingle roofs were a common roofing material until the 1950s. Wood shingles are susceptible to fire and cost more than other types of shingle so they are not as common today as in the past. Distinctive shingle patterns exist in various regions created by the size, shape, and application method. Special treatments such as swept valleys, combed ridges, decorative butt ends, and decorative patterns impart a special character to each building. Wood shingles can also be shaped by steam bending to create a thatch-like appearance, with unique roof details and contours. History of shingles Historically, wooden shingles were usually thin (), relatively narrow (), of varying length (), and almost always planed or knifed smooth. The traditional method for making wooden shingles before the 19th century was to rive (hand split) them from straight-grained knot-free sections of logs pre-cut to the desired length known as bolts. These bolts were quartered or split into wedges. A mallet and froe (or axe) were used to split or rive out thin pieces of wood. The wood species varied according to available local woods, but only the more durable heartwood, or inner section, of the log was usually used. The softer sapwood generally was not used because it deteriorated quickly. Because hand-split shingles were somewhat irregular along the split surface, it was necessary to dress or plane the shingles on a shaving horse with a drawknife or draw-shave to make them fit evenly on the roof.Garvin, James L.. A building history of northern New England. Hanover: University Press of New England, 2001. Print. 29. This reworking was necessary to provide a tight-fitting roof over typically open shingle lath or sheathing boards. Dressing, or smoothing of shingles, was almost universal, no matter what wood was used or in what part of the world the building was located, except in those cases where a temporary or very utilitarian roof was needed. Shingle fabrication was revolutionized in the early 19th century by steam-powered saw mills. Shingle mills made possible the production of uniform shingles in mass quantities. The sawn shingle of uniform taper and smooth surface eliminated the need to hand dress. The supply of wooden shingles was therefore no longer limited by local factors. These changes coincided with (and in turn increased) the popularity of architectural styles such as Carpenter Gothic, Queen Anne, and Shingle style architecture that used shingles to great effect. Hand-split shingles continued to be used in many places well after the introduction of machine sawn shingles. There were, of course, other popular roofing materials, and some regions rich in slate had fewer examples of wooden shingle roofs. Some western \\"boom\\" towns used sheet metal because it was light and easily shipped. Slate, terneplate, and clay tile were used on ornate buildings and in cities that limited the use of flammable wooden shingles. Wooden shingles, however, were never abandoned. Even in the 20th century, architectural styles such as the Colonial Revival and Tudor Revival used wooden shingles. Types of shingles Chilo√© architecture. The simplest form of wood shingle is a rectangle about long. The sides and butt of a shingle are often irregular; the sides may taper and the butt may not be square with the sides. Shingles that have been processed so that the butt is square to the sides are called rebutted and re-squared or rebutted and re-jointed shingles, often abbreviated R&R.; Shingles and shakes may be tapered, straight, split or sawn and any combination of these except straight-tapered. Different species and quality of wood are used as are different lengths and installation methods. Shakes and shingles may also be treated with wood preservatives and fire retardants before or after installation. =Shakes= A shake roof in Romania A shake is a basic wooden shingle made from split logs. Shakes have traditionally been used for roofing and siding applications around the world. Higher-grade shakes are typically used for roofing purposes, while the lower grades are used for siding. In either situation, properly installed shakes provide long-lasting weather protection and a rustic aesthetic, though they require more maintenance than some other more modern weatherproofing systems. The term shake is sometimes used as a colloquialism for all wood shingles, though shingles are sawn rather than split. In traditional usage, \\"shake\\" refers to the board to which the shingle is nailed, not the shingle. Split wooden shingles are referred to as shag shingles. =Modern shingles= Modern wooden shingles, both sawn and split, continue to be made, but they differ from the historic ones. Modern commercially available shakes are generally thicker than the historic handsplit counterpart and are usually left \\"undressed\\" with a rough, corrugated surface. The rough-surface shake is often considered to be more \\"rustic\\" and \\"historic\\", but in fact this is a modern fashion. Some modern shingles are produced in pre-cut decorative patterns, sometimes called fancy- cut shingles, and are available pre-primed for later painting. The sides of rectangular shingles may be re-squared and re-butted, which means they have been reworked so the sides are parallel and the butt is square to the sides. These are more uniform and are installed more neatly as a result. Shingles are less durable than shakes, particularly in wet climates; shakes are finished with a drawknife or similar tool which leaves a smooth surface that resists water penetration, and this in turn slows the softening of wood by microorganisms. Also, the method of splitting shakes rather than sawing ensures only straight-grained pieces (which are much stronger and less likely to warp). =Recycled rubber shake shingles= Modern recycling technologies have allowed the manufacture of rubber shake shingles, made mostly from old tires. These have the same look as a conventional wooden shingle but won't rot, curl, discolor, bend, crack, or take on moisture, and will also not allow moisture to escape.  Shingle production  =Wood selection= Wooden shakes in Poland In North America shakes are typically made from California redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), western red cedar (Thuja plicata), and Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), while in Scandinavia and Central Europe they are more commonly made from pine (Pinus sylvestris) and local variations of spruce (Picea). There are various types of shakes, the main differentiating feature between shakes and other types of shingles is that shakes are split while most shingles are sawn on all sides. The sizes also vary from country to country; in North America shakes are usually made in lengths - the most common, barn shake, or even shakes, which are typically used for siding. In Scandinavia shakes, traditionally used only for roofing, are generally smaller than in North America, measuring long, wide and thick, while in Poland and Slovakia they are usually long, wide and thick. Likewise wooden shingles are manufactured in differing lengths, in North America, . =Log handling and transportation= On the left is a log that fell in 1920; in the foreground a ringer bucked from the log is being trimmed to remove waste; on the right is a finished sling of blocks. Logs are typically cut into appropriate lengths using a chainsaw, then the \\"ringers\\" or cuts are split with an axe into cubes which are small enough to handle, usually 100 to 450 pounds, then stacked on a rope. The rope is looped around the stacked wood and the ends passed through an eye spliced in the end. When the running end is pulled it tightens the \\"sling\\" rope around the blocks preventing them from falling out. The slings are then flown to a central location where they can be loaded on pallets for transport. Previously, swede saws, crosscut saws and hand saws may have been used to cut the logs, and a froe (a heavy blade 24 inches long and three inches wide with a handle at one end perpendicular to the blade) was used to split the ringers. This blade was driven into the wood using a mallet, then the wood could be pried apart by pulling on the handle if it would not split by driving the blade in alone. Before helicopters came into common use for transporting the slings, they were sometimes processed in the bush and finished, hand-split, shakes were carried out in a pack frame. In steep areas, cables were strung along the slope to form a tight-line or tyrolean. Staples were driven into a block straddling the cable, and the block was slid down the cable to a landing accessible to a boat or truck. =Cutting= Both shakes and shingles must be edge grain cut, to prevent warping and splitting as the wood dries. When splitting blocks and manufacturing shakes or shingles particular care must be taken to consider the orientation of the grain in the wood. Likewise when bucking, care must be taken to ensure cuts are precisely perpendicular to the grain, to minimize waste and maintain product quality. When bucking, the log must be cleared off well, so the grain can be seen clearly, allowing straight cuts perpendicular to the grain. When splitting, the ringers are typically split from the bark to the heart, perpendicular to the grain. The heart wood is removed by splitting parallel to the grain, and the bark and sap-wood is removed, as well as any imperfections such as rot or bug holes. The initial split is always made on a knot, burl, check or other imperfection, to allow the blocks to be made as large as possible while disposing of any waste. The blocks should never be split where there is clear wood, or imperfections will be left in the block; or the block will have to be split too small in the process of removing flaws. Canting a log When cutting large logs or severely twisted pieces, it is often necessary to \\"cant\\", or split the entire log into \\"slabs\\". To split a log a ringer is removed at each end of the tree, exposing the interior. Wedges are driven into the face to split off a slab, usually on a natural check or imperfection which runs the entire length of the log. After the face begins to separate, wedges are driven into the resultant opening, starting very near the face and progressively working toward the other end of the log in small steps. Slab split from log Tiny Swedish shakes factory =Manufacture of shakes and shingles from block form= Advertisements from Canadian Forest Industries (1908) Shake blocks are split into 1 inch thick slats called blanks, using either a hydraulic press with a blade attached, called a cuber, or split by hand using a froe and mallet. These blanks are uniform in thickness throughout if split from the same edge without flipping the block. Alternatively, the splitter may flip the block after a blank is taken off each edge, which results in a tapered split from end to end, called tapers or hand-split. The blanks which are not tapered require further processing before application to create this taper, and are run through a large band saw, pushed by hand to cut them from corner to corner forming a tapered shake, sawn on one face. Shingles are cut from the blocks using a circular saw, typically 42-48 inches in diameter. The blocks are clamped in a carriage which slides back and forth across the blade, tilting and moving the block closer to the blade with each pass to automatically form a tapered cut of the correct thickness. The edges of the shingle are then cut with another circular saw called a \\"trim saw\\", to remove irregular edges. The result is a tapered shingle sawn on all six sides. The thickness of the butt, or thicker end of the tapered cut, is usually 3/8 inch thick, but is also commonly made to be 5/8 inch, and can be made to any custom specifications. Chilo√©, Chile  Nearly all the houses and buildings in colonial Chilo√© Archipelago, Chile, were built with wood, and roof shingles were extensively employed in Chilota architecture. Roof shingles of Fitzroya came to be used as money called Real de Alerce. Gallery File:Laziska.

It stars many of MGM leading talents, including Fred Astaire, Lucille Ball, Lucille Bremer, Fanny Brice (the only member of the ensemble who was a star of the original Follies), Judy Garland, Kathryn Grayson, Lena Horne, Gene Kelly, James Melton, Victor Moore, William Powell, Red Skelton, and Esther Williams. Producer Arthur Freed wanted to create a film along the lines of the Ziegfeld Follies Broadway shows, and so, the film is composed of a sequence of unrelated lavish musical numbers and comedy sketches. Filmed in 1944 and 1945,The Films of Judy Garland, Joe Morella and Edward Epstein, p. 132 it was released in 1946 to considerable critical and box-office success. The film was entered into the 1947 Cannes Film Festival. Key songs/dance routines Dance director was Robert Alton, Astaire's second-most-frequent choreographic collaborator after Hermes Pan. All of Astaire's numbers were directed by Vincente Minnelli. The movie's opening featured William Powell as Ziegfeld, who does the prologue. * Here's To The Girls/Bring On The Wonderful Men: by Roger Edens and Arthur Freed. Sung by Astaire with a short solo dance by Cyd Charisse, followed by Lucille Ball cracking a whip over eight chorus-girl panthers, and finally Virginia O'Brien spoofs the previous scene by singing \\"Bring on those Wonderful Men\\" * This Heart of Mine: Classic standard by Harry Warren and Arthur Freed and written specially for Astaire who sings it to Bremer and then leads her in an extravagantly romantic dance of seduction and power-play. The choreography integrates rotating floors, concealed treadmills and swirling dance motifs. * Love: Another standard, this time by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane, sung by Lena Horne.\\"Love\\" sung by Lena Horne (video) * Limehouse Blues: Conceived as a \\"dramatic pantomime\\" with Astaire as a proud but poverty-stricken Chinese labourer whose infatuation with the unattainable Bremer leads to tragedy. The story serves as bookends for a dream ballet inspired by Chinese dance motifs in a vast and extravagant setting, as both Astaire and Bremer perform in yellowface. * The Great Lady Has An Interview: Written by Kay Thompson originally for Greer Garson (she turned it down). Judy Garland spoofs a movie star who can only be cast in Oscar-winning dramas, but wants to play \\"sexy\\" roles (a la Greer Garson, or Katharine Hepburn) giving an interview to dancing reporters about \\"her next picture\\": a bio-pic of Madame Cremantante (the \\"inventor of the safety pin\\"). Originally to be directed by Garland's friend Charles Walters, Vincente Minnelli ended up directing the sequence (the two were dating at the time), and Walters was reassigned as choreographer. * The Babbitt And The Bromide: Astaire and Kelly team up in a comedy song and dance challenge in three sections, to music and lyrics by George and Ira Gershwin. All choreography was by Astaire (third section) and Kelly (sections one and two). This was the only time Astaire and Kelly appeared on screen together in their prime. In spite of efforts by Freed and Minnelli, the two would not partner again on film until That's Entertainment, Part II in 1976. * There's Beauty Everywhere: Originally filmed as a balletic finale with tenor James Melton singing and Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, and Lucille Bremer dancing in a melange of soap bubbles.

The name, literally translated into English, is Cross-Game, a name derived from the fact that it is played between two teams or partnerships of two, where team members sit opposite each other, with an opponent on either side. There are many variants of the game, however, this article deals primarily with the double-deck variant. Basics Unlike most card games, the variant of Krutzjass is not played with a 52 card deck. It is played with a 48 card deck, consisting of only 6 denominations: 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace. In the deck there are two cards of every denomination, so that, for example, it is possible to have 2 nines of spades in one's hand. Like Euchre and bridge, trump does appear in Krutzjass, and trump affects the relative power of certain cards. In a non-trump suit, Aces are high, with cards descending in power in the normal fashion. However, in trump, the hierarchy is as follows, from high to low: Jack, 9, Ace, King, Queen, 10. Also, in trump a 9 is referred to as a knell, and a Jack as a Bauer. Unlike in Euchre, there is no such thing as a left bauer, furthermore a trump must be called. =The deal= After being cut by the player to the left of the dealer, the hands are dealt in counter-clockwise order, with the cards dealt either three or four at a time depending on personal preference. Once the dealer has dealt all the cards, the person to the right of the dealer makes trump. If he has four suits but is unable to make trump, he may pass to his partner. If he has less than four suits in his hand, he may not pass. Furthermore, once the bid has been passed once, it may not be passed again. The next hand is dealt by the player to the right of the previous dealer. =The Wiese= On the playing his or her first card, any player may declare a Wiese, by stating the number of points, or in the case of a 3-of-a-kind the word three. The Wieses are as follows: *200: A jack in every suit *150: A nine in every suit *100: a run of 5 or more, OR having 4 of a kind (other than Js and 9s), where none of the 4 cards are of the same suit. *50: a run of 4 *20: a run of 3 Whoever Wieses the highest point value must prove they have the cards by placing the cards specified in the wiese on the table, as well as any other point combinations they may have handy. Their partner may do likewise if they have any point combinations. Only the winner of the wiese may earn points for their combinations. This means that if North had a 50 and East had 100, North's 50 would not be counted, while East's 100 (provided south could not beat it) would be counted. If two players on opposite teams Wiese the same amount, four factors are used to determine who won the Wiese: # In the case of 100, a 5 card run beats a 4-of-a-kind, and a 6-card run is better than both. # In the case of a run, the run containing the highest card (in rank from low to high 9-Ace) wins. # In the case two runs which are identical in denomination, a Wiese in trump is superior to a Wiese which is not. # If factors 1-3 have not ruled a victor, the player who Wiesed first wins. =Play= The actual play consists of twelve tricks. The first card of the first trick is led by the player to the right of the dealer, and each player plays one card in counter- clockwise order, until all players have played once. The player who wins the trick leads the first card of the next trick. The highest trump wins the trick. If no trump is played, the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If two players play the same card, the card which is put down later supersedes the one played first. Thus, if an Ace is led, the second ace of the same suit may take it. Therefore, if North leads the Bauer, West can still win the trick by playing a second Bauer, which, by virtue of being played later than the first Bauer, takes it. Caution is needed when playing powerful cards. If a player has both the King and the Queen of Trump, he or she may, on the trick when the player no longer has either card in their hand, declare St√´ch (meaning Take), at which point, their team is awarded 20 points. If a player knows they have the largest remaining card in a suit, he or she may declare B√∂ch, signifying that it cannot be taken without the intercession of trump. A player must follow suit, with three exceptions: # If a player has trump, they may play trump instead of following suit. This means that, even if South has a 9 of Hearts, he may play a trump on West's Ace of Hearts. # If a player has no cards of the suit led, they may play a different suit. # If trump is led, a player having no trump except bauers may choose to play a different suit. This exemption applies only to bauers. =Scoring= Along with St√´ch and Wiese, a team scores points for the cards contained in the tricks they have won. In every hand, there are 310 available points to be won. The point values for cards are as follows: *9: 0 points *10: 10 points *Jack: 2 points *Queen: 3 points *King: 4 points *Ace: 11 points *Knell: 14 points *Bauer: 20 points The team winning the last trick gains 6 additional points. If a team takes every trick, they are awarded a much, which is worth 190 points. The first team to accumulate 1500 points wins the game. Notes From long experience, competent players may recognize a few things about Krutzjass: *Never lead an Ace if the other Ace is not in your hand, your partner's hand, or has already been played. *Never lead Trump more than twice. It drains your hand as well as your partner's. *If you believe your partner will win a trick, it is ideal to play a ten or an offsuit ace. This way, you can avoid having your high-value cards captured.

It consisted of a list of sins and the appropriate penances prescribed for them, and served as a type of manual for confessors. Origin In the Early Christian Church absolution for sin was granted after confession and absolution; reconciliation was followed by readmission to the Eucharist. Absolution was granted once in a lifetime, and at set seasons of the year. Public penance did not necessarily include a public avowal of sin, but was decided by the confessor, and was to some extent determined by whether or not the offense was sufficiently open or notorious to cause scandal to others.Hanna, Edward. \\"The Sacrament of Penance.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 3 Dec. 2014 Oakley points out that recourse to public penance varied both in time and place, and was affected by the weaknesses of the secular law. The ancient praxis of penance relied on papal decrees and synods, which were translated and collected in early medieval collection. Little of those written rules, however, was retained in the later penitentials. The earliest important penitentials were those by the Irish abbots Cummean (who based his work on a sixth-century Celtic monastic text known as the Paenitentiale Ambrosianum),L. K√∂rntgen, Studien zu den Quellen der fr√ºhmittelalterlichen Bussb√ºcher, Quellen und Forschungen zum Recht im Mittelalter 7 (Sigmaringen, 1993), pp. 257‚Äì70. Columbanus and Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore of Tarsus. Most later penitentials are based on theirs, rather than on earlier Roman texts. The number of Irish penitentials and their importance is cited as evidence of the particular strictness of the Irish spirituality of the seventh century. Walter J. Woods holds that \\"[o]ver time the penitential books helped suppress homicide, personal violence, theft, and other offenses that damaged the community and made the offender a target for revenge.\\"Woods, Walter J., Walking with Faith: New Perspectives on the Sources and Shaping of Catholic Moral Life, Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2010 According to Thomas Pollock Oakley, the penitential guides first developed in Wales, probably at St. David's, and spread by missions to Ireland.Oakley, Thomas Pollock. English Penitential Discipline and Anglo-Saxon Law in Their Joint Influence, p.28, The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd., 2003 They were brought to Britain with the Hiberno- Scottish mission and were introduced to the Continent by Irish and Anglo-Saxon missionaries.Boudinhon, Auguste. \\"Penitential Canons.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 3 Dec. 2014 Praxis As priests heard confessions, they began to compile unofficial handbooks that dealt with the most confessed sins and wrote down set penances for those sins. Penances would vary given both the severity of the offense and the status of the sinner; such that the penance imposed on a bishop would generally be more severe than that imposed on a deacon for the same offense.Frantzen, Allen J. \\"The Anglo-Saxon Penitentials\\" For stealing, Cummean prescribed that a layman shall do one year of penance; a cleric, two; a subdeacon three; a deacon, four; a priest, five; a bishop, six. The list of various penitential acts imposed on the sinner to ensure reparation included more or less rigorous fasts, prostrations, deprivation of things otherwise allowable; also alms, prayers, and pilgrimages. The duration was specified in days, quarantines, or years. Gildas lists the penance for an inebriated monk, \\"If any one because of drunkenness is unable to sing the Psalms, being stupefied and without speech, he is deprived of dinner.\\"\\"Gildas on Penance\\", The penitentials advised the confessor to inquire into the sinner's state of mind and social condition. The priest was told to ask if the sinner before him was rich or poor; educated; ill; young or old; to ask if he or she had sinned voluntarily or involuntarily, and so forth. The spiritual and mental state of the sinner‚Äîas well as his or her social status was fundamental to the process. Moreover, some penitentials instructed the priest to ascertain the sinner's sincerity by observing posture and tone of voice. Penitentials were soon compiled with the authorization of bishops concerned with enforcing uniform disciplinary standards within a given district. Commutation The Penitential of Cummean counseled a priest to take into consideration in imposing a penance, the penitent's strengths and weaknesses. Those who could not fast were obliged instead to recite daily a certain number of psalms, to give alms, or perform some other penitential exercise as determined by the confessor. Some penances could be commuted through payments or substitutions. While the sanctions in early penitentials, such as that of Gildas, were primarily act of mortification or in some cases excommunication, the inclusion of fines in later compilations derive from secular law, and indicate a church becoming assimilated into the larger society.Davies, Oliver and O'Loughlin, Thomas.Celtic Spirituality, Paulist Press, 1999 The connection with the principles embodied in law codes, which were largely composed of schedules of wergeld or compensation, are evident. \\"Recidivism was always possible, and the commutation of sentence by payment of cash perpetuated the notion that salvation could be bought\\". Commutations and the intersection of ecclesiastical penance with secular law both differed from locality to locality. Nor were commutations restricted to financial payments: extreme fasts and recitation of large numbers of psalms could also commute penances; the system of commutation did not reinforce commonplace connections between poverty and sinfulness, even though it favored people of means and education over those without such advantages. But the idea that whole communities, from top to bottom, richest to poorest, submitted to the same form of ecclesiastical discipline is itself misleading. For example, meat was a rarity in the diet of the poor, with or without the imposition of ecclesiastical fasts. In addition, the system of public penance was not replaced by private penance; the penitentials themselves refer to public penitential ceremonies. Opposition The Council of Paris of 829 condemned the penitentials and ordered all of them to be burnt. In practice, a penitential remained one of the few books that a country priest might have possessed. Some argue that the last penitential was composed by Alain de Lille, in 1180. The objections of the Council of Paris concerned penitentials of uncertain authorship or origin. Penitentials continued to be written, edited, adapted, and, in England, translated into the vernacular. They served an important role in the education of priests as well as in the disciplinary and devotional practices of the laity. Penitentials did not go out of existence in the late twelfth century. Robert of Flamborough wrote his Liber Poenitentialis in 1208.

History =Origins of the clan= The origins of the Brodie clan are mysterious. Much of the early Brodie records were destroyed when Lewis Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Huntly pillaged and burnt Brodie Castle in 1645. It is known that the Brodies were always about since records began. From this it has been presumed that the Brodies are ancient, probably of Pict ancestry, referred to locally as the ancient Moravienses. The historian Dr. Ian Grimble suggested the Brodies were an important Pictish family and advanced the possibility of a link between the Brodies and the male line of the Pictish Kings.Rampini (1897), pp. 257‚Äì258 =Early history= The lands of Brodie are between Morayshire and Nairnshire, on the modern border that separates the Scottish Highlands and Moray. In the time of the Picts, this location was at the heart of the Kingdom of Moravia.Bain (1893), p. 54. Early references show that the Brodie lands to be governed by a T√≤iseach, later to become Thane.Bain (1893), p. 143. Part of the Brodie lands were originally Temple Lands, owned by the order of the Knights Templar.Bain (1893), pp. 134‚Äì135 It is uncertain if the Brodies took their name from the lands of Brodie, or that the lands were named after the clan.Rampini (1897), p. 258. After the T√≤iseachs, whose names are lost, we find a reference to MacBeth, Thane of Dyke in 1262; next, in 1311, a Latin reference to Michael, filius Malconi, Thanus de Brothie et Dyke.

Together with West Leyden High School in Northlake, Illinois, they serve the suburban communities in Franklin Park, Northlake, Rosemont, Schiller Park, River Grove, Melrose Park and unincorporated Leyden Township. Both are part Leyden High School District 212.  History  The original school was opened in 1911 as a one year school. It expanded to a three-year school two years later and it finally became a four-year high school in 1924, the year that the District began. The school was expanded many times until, in 1958, when a second campus was built in Northlake, known as West Leyden. Due to a poor economy and less students being enrolled in the District, the two schools decided to combine athletic teams, starting in the 1981-82 school year. To this day, the schools still compete together as Leyden High School.  Academics  East Leyden's class of 2008 had an average composite ACT score of 19.8, 0.7 points below the state average. 86.1% of the senior class graduated. East Leyden did not make Adequate Yearly Progress on the Prairie State Achievements Examination(headass gentlemen), which with the ACT comprises the state assessments used to fulfill the federal No Child Left Behind Act. Overall, the school did not achieve AYP in reading, and one student subgroup failed to meet expectations in reading and mathematics.  Athletics  West Leyden and East Leyden have competed as a combined athletic program since the 1981‚Äî82 school year.About the District; District 212 has two high schools (East & West Leyden) and one combined athletic program. The athletic merger took place in 1981.; accessed 16 July 2009 The school competes in the West Suburban Conference. It is also a full member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), which governs most sports and competitive activities in Illinois. Teams are stylized as the \\"Eagles\\", with the IHSA referring to the combined program as \\"Franklin Park- Northlake (Leyden)\\". The school sponsors interscholastic sports teams for young men and women in: basketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, and volleyball. Young men may also compete in baseball, football, and wrestling, while women may compete in badminton, bowling, cheerleading, and softball.

The north campus offers hands-on technical programs such as hairdressing, child care, autobody and carpentry, as well as classes for students with a wide range of disabilities, and English Language Learner programs (ELL), and is the location for recognized Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Programs (OYAP) and the Ford Academy of Manufacturing Sciences (FAMS). White Oaks also offers French at the immersion level, and offers the International Baccalaureate Diploma programme.White Oaks Secondary School In the Fraser Institute's report on Ontario schools for the 2012-2013 year, the school was ranked 39 out of 740 secondary schools with an overall rating of 8.3/10. The Film Production and IB Film Studies program (Communications Technology) at the school is an advanced program with both Mac and PC labs. Formerly lead by teacher turned Hollywood film producer, Dale Andrews, the program is known for sending more students to post secondary film schools than any other school in the province of Ontario with graduates attending NYU, Ryerson University, Vancouver Film School, Humber College and Sheridan College.

Eaton Square is a grand, rectangular, residential garden square in London's Belgravia district. It is the largest square in London.

It is larger but less grand than the central feature of the district, Belgrave Square, and both larger and grander than Chester Square. The first block was laid out by Thomas Cubitt from 1827.

Overview 102 Eaton Square The houses in Eaton Square are large, predominantly three-bay-wide buildings, joined in regular terraces in a classical style, with four or five main storeys, plus attic and basement and a mews house behind. Most of the houses are faced with white stucco, but some are faced with underlying high-quality brickwork. Sides are set apart apart. As to roads: the whole rectangle is divided into six compartments or zones as it is bisected lengthways by the Victoria or Buckingham Palace approach way to the King's Road which is very diversely and briefly successively named northeast of Sloane Square). Crossways it is spanned by four less important roads, all of which change name before during and after their transit across the square. All of the roads while in transit across the square assume the name Eaton Square and most of them are one-way, with no full outer circuit in any one direction permitted or possible. In 1900, the Welsh Industrial Association held an exhibition at 83 Eaton Square, rented by the Winifred, Countess of Dundonald, the event was visited by Alexandra, Princess of Wales. The person presiding over the refreshment room exhibition was Kathleen, Duchess of Wellington, assisted by Mrs. A.J. Warden, with a party of attractive ladies wearing the national costume of Wales accompanied by Ivor and Albertina Herbert of Llanover's Harpist playing for the occasion.Western Mail (Cardiff, Wales), June 9, 1900 Between 1916 and 1917, building 87 briefly became the 'Countess of Dundonald hospital', treating many of the wounded in the Great War, George V & Queen Consort Mary of Teck visited the patients at the Hospital, they were greeted by the Staff and Countess of Dundonald herself.https://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/countessofdundonald.html#:~:text=Lost_Hospitals_of_London&text;=The%20Countess%20of%20Dundonald's%20Hospital,those%20who%20had%20given%20beds.Queenslander (Brisbane, QLD) - Feb 17 1917 Before World War II homes on the street ranked as those of the upper class but was outranked by comparators in Belgrave Square, Grosvenor Square, St James's Square or Park Lane. The aftermath of that war saw most of those converted to commercial and institutional uses, leaving the square almost wholly residential, raising its prominence. Some of the houses remain undivided but many have been internally converted into flats or multi-storey instances (maisonettes) by permission or instruction of the Grosvenor Estate. These are often lateral conversions ‚Äì that is, they cut across more than one of the original houses ‚Äì let under typical long leases across the uppermost price bracket, their exact price depending on size, lease duration and amenity. The fa√ßades of the square remain as imagined and built. Most but not all of the freeholds still belong to the Grosvenor Group. Hugh Grosvenor, 7th Duke of Westminster, who inherited the Duke of Westminster title from his father Gerald Grosvenor in 2016, uses one as his London home. Until the 1920s his predecessors lived in Grosvenor House the mansion forerunner to the Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane facing Hyde Park. St Peter's, Eaton Square Co-fronting the north-east end is St Peter's, a 200-feet-long, tree-lined Church of England church, in a classical style, fronted by a six-columned Ionic portico behind which is a slender clock tower. It was designed by Henry Hakewill and built between 1824 and 1827 (during the square's building). Between 1940 and 1944 the Belgian government in exile occupied its three numbers which have been long used as that country's embassy in Britain and further premises in central London as their lesser homes and offices.

Heath James Kenney, circa 1845, portrait by Samuel Laurence James Kenney (1780 ‚Äì 25 July 1849), an English dramatist, was the son of James Kenney, a founder of Boodles' Club in London. He produced more than 40 plays and opera libretti. Career His first play, a farce called Raising the Wind (1803), gained success through the popularity of the character of \\"Jeremy Diddler\\". Kenney produced more than 40 plays and opera libretti between 1803 and 1845. Many, in which Mrs Siddons, Madame Vestris, Foote, Lewis, Liston and other leading players appeared from time to time, enjoyed a considerable vogue. Kenney's most popular play was Sweethearts and Wives, produced at the Haymarket Theatre in 1823 and revived several times. Among his other successful works were False Alarms (1807), a comic opera with music by Braham, Love, Law and Physic (1812), Spring and Autumn (1827), The Illustrious Stranger, or Married and Buried (1827), Masaniello (1829) and The Sicilian Vespers, a tragedy (1840). Kenney numbered Charles Lamb and Samuel Rogers among his friends. He married the widow of the dramatist Thomas Holcroft, by whom he had two sons and two daughters. He died in London in 1849. Charles Lamb Kenney James Kenney's second son, Charles Lamb Kenney (1823 ‚Äì 25 August 1881), made a name as a journalist, dramatist and miscellaneous writer. Beginning as a clerk in the General Post Office in London, he joined the staff of The Times, as a drama critic. Having been called to the bar, he became in 1849 secretary to Ferdinand de Lesseps, and in 1857 published The Gates of the East, in support of the proposed construction of the Suez Canal. Kenney wrote the words for a number of light operas and for several popular songs, the best known being Soft and Low (1865) and The Vagabond (1871). He also published a Memoir of M. W. Balfe (1875) and translated the Correspondence of Balzac. Thackeray and Dickens were among his friends in a literary coterie where he gained a reputation as a wit and a writer of society verse.

His popular writings have been published in The Wall Street Journal, National Review, and Policy Review. McGinnis teaches and writes on constitutional and international law. In constitutional law, he has focused especially on majority and supermajority rules. In international law, he has focused on the question of the proper role of international law in United States law. McGinnis graduated from the Phillips Exeter Academy in 1975, and earned a B.A. from Harvard University in 1978, an M.A. from Balliol College, Oxford University in 1980, and a J.D. magna cum laude from Harvard in 1983. In 1997 he received the Paul M. Bator Award, which is awarded annually by the Federalist Society to an \\"outstanding legal scholar\\" under forty. McGinnis worked in the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice from 1985 to 1991. He has given 10 testimonies before congress. McGinnis was also a litigation associate at the prestigious Sullivan & Cromwell, and a clerk on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. McGinnis's government posts are currently as a member of the National Advisory Committee for the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation, and as a roster member of the United States Panelists for Resolution of World Trade Organization Disputes.

L.J. 1167 He uses this to attack the \\"viewpoint diversity\\" justification that the U.S. Supreme Court used to permit law schools to give racial minorities an advantage in their admissions processes. His argument is that law schools are not, and probably should not be, committed to political viewpoint diversity in the hiring process (implying that they should not use affirmative action-like techniques in recruiting and admitting students). McGinnis has two books forthcoming. In Accelerating Democracy: Transforming Governance Through Technology (Princeton University Press, 2013) he argues that rapidly changing information technology can improve policy. In Originalism and the Good Constitution (Harvard University Press, 2013) he and Mike Rappaport contend that interpreting the Constitution according to its original meaning continues to have beneficial consequences today.

Birth and education Born in Pierrepont, New York, Irving Bacheller graduated from St. Lawrence University in 1882 after which he accepted a job with the Daily Hotel Reporter; by 1883 he was working for the Brooklyn Daily Times. Two years later, he established a business to provide specialized articles to the major Sunday newspapers. It was through the Bacheller Syndicate that he brought to American readers the writings of British authors such as Joseph Conrad, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Rudyard Kipling. He also established a working partnership with the young author and journalist Stephen Crane, whose novel The Red Badge of Courage became famous after it appeared in syndication. Several years later, Bacheller hired Crane to act as a war correspondent in Cuba during the insurrection against Spain; on the journey there, Crane's ship foundered off the coast of Florida, and he was stranded on a dinghy for two days. This experience resulted in his short story \\"The Open Boat\\". Novels Irving Bacheller began to write fiction, publishing \\"The Master of Silence\\" in 1892 and \\"Still House of O'Darrow\\" in 1894. Although he was appointed Sunday editor of the New York World in 1898, he soon chose to pursue a full-time career as a fiction writer and two years later left journalism for a while. Writing novels primarily concerned with early American life in the North Country of New York State, in 1900 his novel Eben Holden, subtitled A Tale of the North Country, proved a major success, and was the fourth best-selling novel in the United States in 1900. In 1901 the book was still ranked fifth for the year and his next novel issued that year titled D'ri and I was tenth in annual sales. Sixteen years later, Bacheller's work The Light in the Clearing was the No.2 best-selling book in America and in 1920, A Man for the Ages was fifth. Civic activities Although he continued to write novels, Bacheller also served as a war correspondent in France during World War I. In later years, he served on the board of trustees of both St. Lawrence University and Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida where he built a home, called Gate o' the Isles, and spent his winters from 1919 through 1940. St. Lawrence's Gunninson Memorial Chapel bells are named \\"The Bacheller Memorial Chimes\\" in his honor. Additionally, the St Lawrence English department's honorary society is named for him, and one of the dining halls bears the name \\"Eben Holden\\". Rollins College Bacheller had a major role in the development of Rollins College when, in 1925, he was named head of a search committee to find a new president for the school. He remembered a magazine editor he had known and admired in New York, Hamilton Holt, and he wrote to Holt offering him the job saying, \\"It's a cinch for a man of your capacity.\\" Holt took the job and changed Rollins College, with the help of Bachellor, from a tiny school with very little money, to a school with a multimillion-dollar endowment and a beautiful, thriving campus. In 1940, with Holt still president, Rollins College announced the creation of a professorship of creative writing in Irving Bacheller's name. Later years Irving Bacheller died in White Plains, New York in 1950. In recent years, several of his works have been reprinted and a previously unpublished manuscript, titled Lost in the Fog, was published in 1990.

The Wyalusing Path or trail was a historical trace that ran from what is now Wyalusing to the Native American village of Canaserage (now Muncy) in Pennsylvania in the United States. Wyalusing is on the east bank of the North Branch of the Susquehanna River in Bradford County and Muncy is on the east bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River in Lycoming County, so the path provided a short cut between the two main branches of the Susquehanna River. The alternative and much longer route was to follow the North Branch south from Wyalusing to the confluence with the West Branch at the Native village of Shamokin (now Sunbury, Pennsylvania), then north up the West Branch to Muncy. On leaving Wyalusing, the path went south a short distance, then forded the Susquehanna River near the Moravian village of Friedensh√ºtten. It followed Sugar Run Creek upstream, climbed Bartlett Mountain, and crossed into what is now Sullivan County near the modern-day village of Colley in Colley Township. The Wyalusing Path climbed Dutch Mountain (coming near or crossing into Wyoming County), then passed between the headwaters of Loyalsock Creek and Mehoopany Creek in Sullivan County. The exact course of the path is less clear here, but it encountered Muncy Creek near its source in Sullivan County and followed it to it mouth at Canaserage (Muncy). Much of what we know about the Wyalusing Path comes from travelers' accounts of it. In May 1772, Samuel Harris had to ford Muncy Creek twenty times following the path. In June 1772, Moravian Bishop John Ettwein led a group of some 200 Lenape and Mohican Christians from their village of Friedensh√ºtten (Cabins of Peace) west along the Wyalusing Path to Muncy, fording Muncy Creek thirty six times along the way. At Muncy they took the Great Shamokin Path and others to their new village of Friedensstadt (City of Peace) on the Beaver River in southwestern Pennsylvania.

My Captain!\\" is an extended metaphor poem written by Walt Whitman in 1865 about the death of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. It is one of four poems written by Whitman about the death of Lincoln, the others being When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd, Hush'd be the Camps To-day, and This Dust was Once the Man. Immediately successful, the poem was Whitman's first to be anthologized and the most famous during his life. The poem is written in a structure generally considered uncharacteristic of Whitman's poetry; it utilizes a rhyming pattern, has a song-like flow, uses a simple metaphor (that of the Ship of State), and has a narrator other than Whitman. These elements are likely what made the poem initially popular and well-received, and it was considered one of the greatest American poems through World War II. Critical consensus has since been generally negative towards \\"My Captain\\". Some critics consider the poem \\"conventional\\" and \\"trite\\", though it is still one of Whitman's most famous works. The poem has been referenced several times in popular culture, most notably in the film Dead Poets Society.  Background  In the late 1850s and early 1860s, Whitman established his reputation as a poet with the release of Leaves of Grass. Whitman intended to write a distinctly American epic and developed a free verse style inspired by the cadences of the King James Bible. The small volume, first released in 1855, was considered controversial by some, with critics attacking Whitman's verse as \\"obscene.\\" However, it attracted praise from American Transcendentalist essayist, lecturer, and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, which contributed to fostering significant interest in Whitman's work. At the start of the American Civil War, Whitman moved from New York to Washington, D.C., where he obtained work in a series of government offices, first with the Army Paymaster's Office and later with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He volunteered in the army hospitals as a \\"hospital missionary.\\" His wartime experiences informed his poetry which matured into reflections on death and youth, the brutality of war, patriotism, and offered stark images and vignettes of the war. Whitman's brother, George Washington Whitman, had been taken prisoner in Virginia on September 30, 1864 and was held for five months in Libby Prison, a Confederate prisoner-of-war camp near Richmond, Virginia. On February 24, 1865, George was granted a furlough to return home because of his poor health, and Whitman had travelled to his mother's home in New York to visit his brother. While visiting Brooklyn, Whitman contracted to have his collection of Civil War poems, Drum-Taps, published. =Walt Whitman and Abraham Lincoln= Whitman first became interested in Abraham Lincoln in the beginning of the American Civil War. He felt that Lincoln could be a great leader as early as 1860, and grew to admire him. Whitman's brother George had been serving in the Union Army and was wounded at the Battle of Fredericksburg, prompting Whitman to travel to Washington D.C. from New York in 1862 to take care of his brother. While in the capital Whitman's admiration for the president blossomed. Although they never directly met in person, Whitman saw Lincoln multiple times from 1862 to 1865, sometimes from close quarters. Whitman was struck by the President's appearance and unpretentious dignity, and trusted Lincoln's \\"supernatural tact\\" and \\"idiomatic Western genius\\"\\". He admired the President, writing in October 1863, \\"I love the President personally\\". Whitman considered himself and Lincoln to be \\"afloat in the same stream\\" and \\"rooted in the same ground\\". Whitman and Lincoln shared similar views on slavery and the Union, revered heroes of the American Revolution, did not practice any certain religion, came from working-class origins, and used Jacksonian populism rhetoric. In addition, their literary styles were somewhat similar, both being inspired by the Bible, Shakespeare, Thomas Paine, Robert Burns, American vernacular speech, American political oratory, and American drama. Upon realizing these similarities, Whitman later declared that \\"Lincoln gets almost nearer me than anybody else\\". There is an account of Lincoln reading Whitman's Leaves of Grass poetry collection in his office, and another of the President saying \\"Well, he looks like a man!\\" upon seeing Whitman in Washington, D.C., but these accounts are most likely fictitious. Lincoln's death on April 15, 1865 greatly moved Whitman, who proceeded to write multiple poems in tribute to the fallen President. O Captain! My Captain!, When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd, Hush'd be the Camps To-day, and This Dust was Once the Man were all written as sequels to Drum-Taps. Although the poems do not specifically mention Lincoln, they turn the assassination of the President into a sort of martyrdom. Text fair copy of Whitman's poem‚Äîsigned and dated March 9, 1887‚Äîaccording to the 1881 edition Publication history  Helen Vendler thinks it likely that Whitman wrote the poem before \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\\" and considers it a direct response to \\"Hush'd Be the Camps To-Day\\". An early draft of the poem is written in free verse.' \\"My Captain\\" was first published in The Saturday Press on November 4, 1865, around two weeks before the publication closed. Around the same time it was included in Whitman's book, Sequel to Drum-Taps publication in The Saturday Press was considered a \\"teaser\\" for the book. It was then included in the 1867 edition of Leaves of Grass. Whitman revised the poem several times during his life, including in the 1871 Passage to India. Its final republication by Whitman was in the 1881 edition of Leaves of Grass. When the publisher Harper requested to reprint the poem in a school course reader, Whitman said \\"It's My Captain again; always My Captain,\\" and wrote that he told John Swinton he was sorry he wrote the poem \\"but there's no help for it now: let's resign ourselves to the inevitable!\\" Whitman told Horace Traubel \\"Damn My Captain [. . .] I'm almost sorry I ever wrote the poem\\", though he admitted that it \\"had certain emotional immediate reasons for being\\". However, Whitman continued to give public readings of the poem at lectures, even as his growing prominence may have allowed him to read a different poem. Whitman's lecture on Lincoln, invitation, 1886 During the 1870s and 1880s, Whitman regularly gave lectures on the \\"Death of Abraham Lincoln\\". He usually ended or began the lectures by reciting \\"My Captain\\".  Reception  \\"My Captain\\" is considered to not be characteristic of Walt Whitman's poetry. The poem was Whitman's most popular during his lifetime, becoming the only one to be anthologized during his lifetime. In early 1866, a reviewer in the Boston Commonwealth wrote \\"this displaced and slighted poet has written the most touching dirge for Abraham Lincoln of all that have appeared.\\"' The Commonwealth continued that the poem \\"will do much [. . .] to remove the prejudice against Mr. Whitman in many minds.\\" After reading the poem, William Dean Howells became convinced that Whitman had cleaned the \\"old channels of their filth\\"; he would become a prominent defender of Whitman. In 1892 The Atlantic wrote that My Captain was universally accepted as Whitman's \\"one great contribution to the world's literature\\". In 1903 George Rice Carpenter described the poem as \\"possibly the greatest [of poetry produced after the Civil War], in that it is the most direct and spontaneous translation of the emotion of a people into beautiful imagery\\". It was considered in 1962 to be his best known work, though William Coyle considers it his \\"least characteristic\\". It grew to become one of the ten most popular English poems during the 1900s. In his book Cannons by Consensus, Joseph Ciscila writes that the poem was \\"one of the two or three most highly praised of Whitman‚Äôs poems during the 1920s and 1930s\\". He continues that it \\"epitomizes the form and poetic sentiment that these more conservative-minded critics appreciated in verse\\". In 1916, Henry B. Rankin wrote that My Captain was \\"the nation's first aye, the world's funeral dirge for our First American\\". In 1919, The New York Sun wrote that it was the \\"most likely to live forever\\" of Whitman's poems.‚ÄúWalt Whitman‚Äôs Centenary,‚Äù New York Sun, May 31, 1919, sec. 8, pp. 2‚Äì3 Vernon L. Parrington considered the poem to represent the \\"perfect threnody of American poetry\\"Vernon L. Parrington, Main Currents in American Thought, vol. 3 (New York: Harcourt, 1930), 86. and the 1936 book American Life in Literature considered it the best American poem.Jay B. Hubbell, ed., American Life in Literature (New York: Harper, 1936), 155. However, not all critics were as positive during this period. One wrote that \\"O Captain!\\" was ‚Äúmore suitable for recitation before an enthusiastically uncritical audience than for its place in the Oxford Book of English Verse.‚Äù Beginning in the 1920s, Whitman became increasingly critically respected, and by 1950 he was considered one of the most prominent American authors. Poetry anthologies began to include more of his poetry. While from 1919 to 1946 \\"O Captain!\\" had been his most frequently published poem, Ciscila concludes that shortly after the end of World War II the poem \\"all but disappeared\\" from American anthologies and that it \\"virtually disappeared\\" after 1966. Critical consensus has since been far more negative. In 2000 Vendler argued that \\"Whitman has chosen to speak now as a sailor-boy\\" and as a result silenced \\"his own idiosyncratic voice\\", creating a \\"designedly democratic and populist poem\\". In 2004, Epstein wrote that \\"it may seem hard to believe that the poet who wrote 'Lilacs' also wrote 'O Captain! My Captain!'.\\" In 2010, C. K. Williams concluded that the poem was a \\"truly awful piece of near doggerel triteness\\" and that it merits all of the \\"opprobrium\\" that it has. However, it is still considered one of Whitman's most famous poems.''''  Analysis  Stefan Sch√∂berlein writes that the poem \\"has largely been ignored in English speaking academia due to its sentimentality\\", with the exception of a 2000 analysis by Helen Vendler. = Structure = The poem utilizes a rhyming structure and is designed for recitation. It is written with the structure of three stanzas, consisting of four seven-beat lines each (or two lines of tetrameter and trimeter) and a refrain at the end that changes only slightly from stanza to stanza. Vendler concludes this simple form suggests that \\"soldiers and sailors have a right to verse written for them\\". His adoption of elements of 'popular verse' allowed Whitman to \\"exemplify\\" democracy by creating a poem that he felt would be understood by the general public. Daniel Mark Epstein considers the structure to be \\"uncharacteristically mechanical, formulaic\\". He goes on to describe the poem in structure as a \\"very conventional\\" ballad in nine quatrains, comparable to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's writing in \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" and much of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's work, drawing particular similarities to \\"In Memoriam A.H.H.\\" Justin Kaplan agrees, calling the poem \\"thoroughly conventional\\". The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Literature entry on Whitman, however, argues that the poem has been \\"unfairly criticized for its conventional rhythm and rhyme\\". Amanda Gailey theorizes that the poem was written by Whitman, who had just been fired from his job at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, to attract a wider audience to his poetry. She writes that Whitman likely \\"deliberately [made] a salve for his ailing country\\" by writing the poem.' William Pannapacker agrees, describing the poem as a \\"calculated critical and commercial success\\". Daniel Aaron writes that \\"Death enshrined the Commoner [Lincoln], [and] Whitman placed himself and his work in the reflected limelight.\\" Jerome Loving considers that the structure gives \\"My Captain\\" a \\"sing-song\\" quality, evocative of folk groups such as the Hutchinson Family Singers and Cheney Family Singers. Frances Winwar argues that \\"in the simple ballad rhythm beat the heart of the folk\\". Whitman very rarely wrote poems that rhymed, and The Atlantic postulated in 1892 that his choosing to revert to a rhyming structure was Whitman rising \\"above himself\\": = 'Ship of state' metaphor = The poem utilizes a metaphor of describing the United States as a ship that Whitman had previously used in \\"Death in the School-Room\\". It begins by describing Lincoln as the captain of the nation. By the second stanza, Lincoln has become America's \\"dear father\\" as his death is revealed (\\"fallen cold and dead\\"). Vendler writes that the poem is told from the point of view of a young Union recruit, a \\"sailor-boy\\" who considers Lincoln like a \\"dear father\\". The American Civil War is almost over and \\"the prize we sought is almost won;/the port is almost near\\" with crowds awaiting the ship's arrival. Then, Lincoln is shot and dies. Vendler notes that in the first two stanzas the narrator is speaking to the dead captain, addressing them as \\"you\\". In the third stanza, he switches to reference Lincoln in the third person (\\"My captain does not answer\\"). Winwar describes the \\"roused voice of the people, incredulous at first, then tragically convinced that their Captain lay fallen\\". Whitman had likely read newspaper reports that Lincoln had dreamed of a ship under full sail the night before his assassination; the imagery was allegedly a recurring dream Lincoln had before significant moments in his life. On March 19, 1863, Whitman wrote a letter comparing the head of state to a ships captain. The metaphor of a Ship of State has been often used by authors.Sch√∂berlein compares the imagery of \\"My Captain\\" to the Lamentation of Christ, specifically Correggio's 1525 Deposition. = Religious imagery = In the second and third stanzas, Whitman invokes religious imagery, making Lincoln a \\"messianic figure\\", according to Sch√∂berlein. The poem's speaker places their \\"arm beneath [Lincoln's] head\\" in the same way that \\"Mary cradled Jesus\\" after his crucifixion. With Lincoln's death, \\"the sins of America are absolved into a religio-sentimental, national family\\". = Other = The poem utilizes elements of war journalism, including \\"the bleeding drops of red\\" and \\"fallen cold and dead\\". Robin Williams  In popular culture  The poem has additionally made an appearance in pop culture, notably in the 1989 American film Dead Poets Society. John Keating (played by Robin Williams) is an English teacher at the [fictional] Welton Academy boarding school. In his first class with the students, Keating asks the students if they've heard the line \\"O Captain! My Captain\\". Seeing that no students recognize the quote, he gives a brief introduction of Whitman's poem. Following this preface, Keating says, \\"Now in this class, you can either call me Mr. Keating, or if you're slightly more daring, O Captain! My Captain.\\" Keating is later fired from the school and replaced by a strict schoolmaster. As Keating returns to collect his belongings, the film's closing scene brings the O Captain! My Captain reference full circle, ending with the students standing on their desks and addressing Keating as \\"O Captain! My Captain!\\", as a final farewell to him. After Robin Williams' suicide in 2014, the hashtag \\"#ocaptainmycaptain\\" began trending on Twitter and fans paid tribute to Williams by recreating the \\"O Captain! My Captain!\\" scene. Luke Buckmaster, a film critic, wrote in The Guardian that \\"some people, maybe even most people, now associate Whitman‚Äôs verse first and foremost with a movie rather than a poem\\". After the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the poem was translated into Hebrew and put to music by Naomi Shemer.

Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Hama Governorate. During the Crusades, the town was a fortress, ruled by the Banu Munqidh family. It played an important part in the Christian and Muslim politics of the crusades. Location Shaizar is located at a strategically vital crossing point on the Orontes River, 28 km to the northwest of Hama. \\"Shaizar\\" at www.cometosyria.com, accessed 3 May 2018 Name evolution The fortress of Shaizar In the Amarna letters (14th century BC) it is mentioned as Senzar or Sezar. To the Greeks it was known as Sidzara, but during the Seleucid empire it was renamed Larissa, after the town Larissa in Thessaly (Greece) from which many colonists came. It reverted to its earlier name under the Roman Empire and was known as Sezer under the Byzantine Empire. The Crusaders rendered the city's name in Latin as Caesarea. This name had not been used in any earlier period, and was derived from the Crusaders mistakenly identifying this city as being Caesarea Mazaca, a place renowned in Christian history as the home of Saint Basil of Caesarea. Shaizar's ruins are known as Saijar in modern Arabic. History =Bronze Age= Shaizar is mentioned as Senzar or Sezar in the Amarna letters (14th century BC). =Hellenistic period= The region was conquered by Alexander the Great in 333‚Äì332 BC. Diodorus Siculus (first century BC) records local legends attributing the establishment of the town by one of his cavalry regiments originating from Thessaly. During the Seleucid dynasty the town was renamed Larissa, after the town in Thessaly from which many colonists came. =Roman period= The Roman armies led by Pompey conquered Syria in 64 BC. Syria was briefly occupied by Republican-Parthian forces under the Parthian prince Pacorus I. =Byzantine and Early Arab periods= The city remained part of the Christianised empire, known as the Byzantine Empire, under the name of Sezer. Shaizar fell to the Arabs in 638 and frequently passed from Arab to Byzantine control. It was sacked in 969 by Byzantine emperor Nicephorus II, and was captured by Basil II in 999, after which it became the southern border of the Byzantine Empire and was administered by the Bishop of Shaizar. A Fatimid castle was standing at Shaizar by the time the Byzantines recaptured the town. It was lost to the Banu Munqidh in 1081 when 'Ali ibn Munqidh bought it from the bishop. The Byzantines besieged it numerous times after this but failed to recover it. =Crusaders= The Franks arrived in Syria in 1098 during the First Crusade. The interaction between the Crusader states and the Banu Munqidh rulers of Shaizar consisted of a series of wars and alliances. =Munqidhite Shaizar (1081‚Äì1157)= The fortress of Shaizar The Munqidhites controlled territory east of Shaizar, across the al-Ansariyah mountains to the Mediterranean coast, from the coastal cities of Latakia in the north to Tortosa in the south. During the First Crusade, the emir assisted the Crusaders passing through his land, giving them horses and food and other provisions. After the crusade it was bordered by the crusader Principality of Antioch and was subject to raids from both Antioch and the County of Tripoli. When the Crusaders briefly conquered Qalaat al-Madiq, a fortress to the northwest of Shaizar and overlooking ancient Apamea, in 1106, the Banu Munqidh clan harassed them from their base in Shaizar. In 1106, the Munqidhite emirs Murshid and Sultan defeated William-Jordan of Tripoli, and in 1108 and 1110 they had to bribe Tancred to leave. Tancred, Baldwin I of Jerusalem, and Bertrand of Tripoli besieged the city during the battle of Shaizar of 1111 for two weeks, but returned home when the army of Mawdud of Mosul cut off their access to food and water. Tancred nevertheless built a castle nearby on Tell ibn Ma'shar, in order to keep Shaizar under close watch. When Ridwan of Aleppo died in 1113, Shaizar was inundated by many of his Assassin supporters that were expelled from the city by his son Alp Arslan al-Akras. Shaizar participated in Ilghazi's campaign against Antioch in 1119. When Baldwin II of Jerusalem was taken captive by the Artuqid Belek Ghazi outside Edessa in 1123, he was held at Shaizar until his release the next year. As part of his ransom he was forced to give up his daughter Ioveta as a hostage, who was also held at Shaizar until her own ransom in 1125. As Shaizar was a friendly state, Baldwin was allowed to visit his daughter there, but Shaizar was also friendly to its Muslim neighbours, and in 1125 was incorporated into the territory of Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi, atabeg of Mosul. When Zengi succeeded-Bursuqi's son in Mosul in 1127 and claimed Aleppo as well, Shaizar recognized his suzerainty. In 1137, Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus arrived to impose Byzantine authority on Antioch, and promised Raymond of Antioch a principality consisting of Shaizar, Aleppo, Homs, and Hama if Antioch was returned to the Empire. In April 1138, the Byzantine army led the siege of Shaizar, but Raymond and Joscelin II of Edessa did not assist the emperor. Zengi soon arrived to relieve the fortress in May. The emir preferred Byzantine control to Zengid, and offered to recognize John as his overlord. Neither John or Zengi ever really enforced their authority there and Shaizar remained independent. The emirate lasted until the enormous earthquake of 1157, during which the citadel collapsed, killing almost the entire family, who had assembled there to celebrate a circumcision. The only survivors out of the whole family were the wife of emir, and the emir's nephew Usama ibn Munqidh, the famed poet-knight who was on a diplomatic mission to Damascus. Description of the city Referring to the crusader siege of Shaizar in 1157, William of Tyre writes: : \\"The city of Shayzar lies upon the same Orontes river which flows by Antioch. It is called by some Caesarea, and by them is believed to be the famous metropolis of Cappadocia over which the distinguished teacher St. Basil once presided; but those who hold this view are in grave error. For that Caesarea is a fifteen days journey or more from Antioch. This city is in Coelesyria, a province which is separated from Cappadocia by many intervening provinces. Nor is the name Caesarea, but rather Caesara. It is one of the suffragan cities belonging to the patriarchate of Antioch. It is very conveniently situated. The lower part extends along the plain, while upon the heights of the upper part is the citadel, fairly long in extent but rather narrow. It is well fortified, for in addition to its natural defenses, the river protects it on one side and the city on the other, so that it is entirely inaccessible.\\"William of Tyre, A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea, trans.

Fulcher of Chartres, an eyewitness to the siege in 1111, did not know the classical Roman or Greek name for the site, and noted that the Turks called it \\"Sisara\\", \\"but the inhabitants of the country commonly call it 'Chezar'.\\"Fulcher of Chartres, A History of the Expedition to Jerusalem, trans. Frances Rita Ryan, University of Tennessee Press, 1969, bk. II, ch. XLV.7-9, pp. 202-203. Life in the city Regarding the citizens, William of Tyre says they \\"had but little knowledge of arms; their attention was devoted almost entirely to trading.\\" Many of them were Christians, whom William considered to be suffering as slaves under their Muslim rulers, but the Munqidhites seem to have been tolerant lords and both Christians and Muslims of various sects lived there peacefully. A very lively account of life in Shaizar, and various other places in the Muslim world, was written by the prince Usama ibn Munqidh, titled Kitab al-I'tibar, and gives great insight into Muslim life in the 12th century. The Munqidhite emirs are shown as patrons of literature, who delight in hunting and other sports, as well as delighting in making war on, and negotiating peace with, their Christian and Muslim neighbours. Munqidh emirs of Shaizar Shaizar was ruler by the Banu Munquid from 1059‚Äì1157. The emirs were: *Sultan ibn 'Ali ibn al-Muqallad ibn Munqidh al-Kinani (1059‚Äì1081) *'Izz ad-Dawla Sadid al-Mulk ibn Munqidh (1081‚Äì1082) *'Izz ad-Dawla abu-l-Murhaf Nasr ibn Munqidh (1082‚Äì1098) *Majd ad- Din abu Salamah Murshid ibn 'Izz ad-Dawla ibn Munqidh (1098‚Äì1137; the Latin Machedolus, father of Usama ibn Munqidh) *'Izz ad-Din abu-l-'Asakir Sultan ibn 'Izz ad-Dawla ibn Munqidh (1098‚Äì1154) *Taj ad-Dawla Nasr ad-Din Muhammad ibn abu-l-Asakir ibn Munqidh (1154‚Äì1157). Usama ibn Munqidh Usama ibn Munqidh was a medieval Muslim poet, author, faris (knight), and diplomat from the Banu Munqidh dynasty of Shaizar in northern Syria. His life coincided with the rise of several medieval Muslim dynasties, the arrival of the First Crusade, and the establishment of the Crusader states. He was born in Shaizar, ≈ûeyzer. He was the nephew and potential successor of the emir of Shaizar, but was exiled in 1131 and spent the rest of his life serving other leaders. He was a courtier to the Burids, Zengids, and Ayyubids in Damascus, serving the Zengi, Nur ad-Din, and Saladin over a period of almost fifty years. He also served the Fatimid court in Cairo, as well as the Artuqids in Hisn Kayfa. He traveled extensively in Arab lands, visiting Egypt, Syria, Palestine and along the Tigris River, and went on pilgrimage to Mecca. He often meddled in the politics of the courts in which he served, and he was exiled from both Damascus and Cairo. During and immediately after his life, he was most famous as a poet and adib (a \\"man of letters\\"). He wrote many poetry anthologies, such as the Kitab al-'Asa (\\"Book of the Staff\\"), Lubab al-Adab (\\"Kernels of Refinement\\"), and al-Manazil wa'l-Diyar (\\"Dwellings and Abodes\\"), and collections of his own original poetry. In modern times, he is remembered more for his Kitab al-I'tibar (\\"Book of Learning by Example\\" or \\"Book of Contemplation\\"), which contains lengthy descriptions of the Crusaders, whom he interacted with on many occasions, and some of whom he considered friends. Most of his family was killed in an earthquake at Shaizar in 1157. He died in Damascus in 1188, at the age of 93. =Assassin, Zengid and Mamluk periods (1158‚Äì1260)= The Assassins then took control of the ruins, and they were defeated by the Crusaders in 1158, but disputes forced the Crusaders to abandon the siege. Nur ad-Din then incorporated the remains into his territory and rebuilt the city. Shaizar was destroyed again by an earthquake in 1170 and the remnants were taken by Saladin in 1174. They were rebuilt again, but in 1241 the city was sacked by the Khwarezmians. The Mamluk sultan Baibars captured and rebuilt the city in 1260. =Modern period= The citadel (castle) was declared a national monument in 1958 and the last inhabitants were evacuated to prevent archaeological damage. Today the site is known as Qal‚Äôat Shayzar (citadel or castle of Shayzar), while the name Shaizar (or Shayzar) is used for the modern town.

Up until the late '90s animated cartoons have been the most common venue, right after comics, to depict superheroic adventures. Contrary to live action productions, they do not require expensive sets and special effects, although animation production standards can vary widely in cost. As a result, cartoon shows featuring superheroes became a staple of children's entertainment with a few shows reaching adult audiences. History In late 1941, Superman became the first superhero to be depicted in animation, The Superman series of groundbreaking theatrical cartoons was produced by Fleischer/Famous Studios from 1941 to 1943 and featured the famous \\"It's a bird, it's a plane\\" introduction. One of the most successful imitations/parodies was Terrytoons' Mighty Mouse series, which became the flagship property of the studio. A frame from the opening sequence of the 1960s Spider-Man series With the rise of television in the 1960s, superheroes have found success in animated television series geared towards children, including Filmation's Superman-Batman Adventure Hour and Grantray-Lawrence Animation's Spider-Man, featuring the \\"does whatever a spider can\\" theme song. A frame from the opening sequence of Super Friends In the 1970s, Japanese anime strove to emulate American superhero cartoons with their own creations. The most successful was Kagaku ninja tai Gatchaman (Science Ninja Team Gatchaman) which became a television classic that created a template that many other anime series followed. In the 1970s and 1980s American superhero animated series were constrained by the broadcasting restrictions that activist groups like Action for Children's Television lobbied for. The most popular series in this period, Super Friends, an adaptation of DC's Justice League of America, was designed to be as nonviolent and inoffensive as possible. The Plastic Man Comedy/Adventure Show and Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends were similarly tame. Kagaku ninja tai Gatchaman aired in North America as the Battle of the Planets but it was so severely edited for violence that plots were incoherent although it still won many fans for its distinctive take on the genre. A scene from Batman: The Animated Series In the 1980s, the Saturday morning cartoon Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends brought together Spider-Man, Iceman, and Firestar. The following decade, Batman: The Animated Series and X-Men, aimed at somewhat older audiences, found critical success in mainstream publications. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said of the former, \\"The animation is first-rate, moving Batman across gray cotton clouds and against a backdrop of teetering Art Deco-style skyscrapers. ... In contrast to both the '60s show or [director] [Tim] Burton's movies, the new Batman features plots that actually make sense and an occasional bit of clever dialogue that never curdles into camp\\".Tucker, Ken. \\"TV Review: Holy Bat-Toon!\\", Entertainment Weekly, September 4, 1992 Frank Lovece of Entertainment Weekly said of the latter, \\"[T]he art is miles above the pasteboard cutouts of the 1960s and '70s superhero 'toons, and the characters are more believably flawed. The dialogue still comes straight from drive-in movies, though....\\"Lovece, Frank. TV Review: X-Men, Entertainment Weekly, March 5, 1993 Series that followed included Superman: The Animated Series (1996) and Cartoon Network's adaptation of DC's Justice League (2001) and Teen Titans. The animation style of Batman: the Animated Series was replicated in the sequels The New Batman Adventures and Batman Beyond and the spinoffs, Static Shock and Superman: The Animated Series and other shows. In 1994, Phantom 2040 made its debut, loosely based on Lee Falk's legendary superhero The Phantom, and adapted into the screen by Aeon Flux-creator Peter Chung. The series followed the descendant of the Phantom of the original comic books in the year of 2040. Despite critical acclaim, the series was cancelled after two season, but remains a cult favorite. Similarly, Walt Disney Pictures produced the highly acclaimed television series Gargoyles, created by Greg Weisman. This production presented the adventures of a clan of heroic night creatures in stories that owed as much to William Shakespeare and medieval history as they did to traditional superhero fiction. HBO's Spawn, originally aired from 1997 through 1999, was one of the few animated superhero series to be aimed exclusively at an adult audience, In 1998, Cartoon Network began airing The Powerpuff Girls, a superhero parody designed to appeal to both children and adults. The show spoofed both specific superheroes (like Wonder Woman, Sailor Moon and Spawn, among many others) as well as general conventions of the genre (like how violence is often presented as the best/only solution to problems in superhero stories, for example). In the 2000s, the Nickelodeon series, Danny Phantom, earned its own appreciative following with its intelligent humor and appealing character story arc narrative structure. This was complemented in the Cartoon Network's ongoing Ben 10 franchise. In 2013 Mattel released a superhero influenced reboot version of Max Steel (2013 TV series) which aired on Disney XD. Although Warner Brothers Animation's DC animated universe was discontinued after the conclusion of Justice League Unlimited in 2006, the company continued with further series like The Batman and Batman: The Brave and the Bold which took a lighter thematic tone to the DC Universe adaptations. Currently, WB has returned to the DCAU franchise's more sophisticated standards with Young Justice with Greg Weisman producing. Likewise, Marvel Comics have continued with more younger appealing productions like Iron Man: Armored Adventures, Ultimate Spider-Man and The Super Hero Squad Show and more sophisticated series such as The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes and The Spectacular Spider-Man'' Concurrent to these broadcast productions, original animated video release series featuring the superhero characters of Marvel Comics and DC Comics respectively began with success in the 2000s, such as the DC Universe Animated Original Movies. Considering that DVD retail does not have to contend with network television audience demographics expectations, or government broadcast regulations from the Federal Communications Commission in the United States or the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in Canada, the format affords a level of content freedom for an older and more sophisticated audience. =Animal superheroes= In addition to the human superheroes found in comic books, animated superhero series have often featured comedic anthropomorphic animal superheroes. These series combine two timeless niches in children‚Äôs television: superheroes anfunny animals. The first such series was the Superman-inspired Mighty Mouse, which was the flagship series of the Terrytoons company in the 1940s. Underdog, ThunderCats, Darkwing Duck, Biker Mice from Mars, \\"Street Sharks\\" and Earthworm Jim (based on the video game series of the exact name) are popular examples from later decades, while Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles combined martial arts clich√©s and conventions with the more sci fi, fantastical, and outrageous elements of superhero stories. The most recent popular example of such series is Krypto the Superdog, which featured Superman's dog as well as Streaky the Supercat and Ace The Bathound, all more cartoony versions of original characters from the DC Universe.

The company was founded by Sydney S. Guy (1885‚Äì1971) who was born in Kings Heath, Birmingham. Guy Motors operated out of its Fallings Park factory from 1914 to 1982, playing an important role in the development of the British motor industry. History =Foundation and the First World War= Sydney S. Guy registered Guy Motors Limited on Saturday 30 May 1914, the same day he departed his position as works manager at the Wolverhampton company, Sunbeam. A factory was built on the site at Fallings Park, Wolverhampton. and by September 1914 production was underway on the newly designed 30 cwt lorry. This employed a much lighter form of pressed steel frame, unlike the more commonly used heavy rolled steel channel frames of the time. This made the vehicle able to cross difficult terrain and a 14-seat post bus built based on the design was used for crossing the Scottish Highlands.Wolverhampton History and Heritage,\\"Guy Motors\\" , Retrieved 16 August 2012 Guy's 14 seater bus designed for use in the highlands In 1915 Guy came under control of the Ministry of Munitions and production was focused on the war effort. The factory continued to produce 30 cwt lorries which were supplied to Britain's allies in the First World War. They also produced Wasp and Dragonfly radial aircraft engines, Tylor truck engines and Maudslay gearboxes as well as being the country's largest maker of depth charge fuses. For their efforts during the war Guy received a commendation from William Weir, Secretary of State for Air. Due to orders from the ministry Guy prospered during the war, expanding its factory and became an established name in British manufacturing.Broach, Stuart Fergus, Hannay, R. N., \\"80 Years of Guy Motors:Cars, Trucks and Buses(British Bus & Truck Heritage)\\" Venture Publications Limited. (1994), =1920s= The post-war period was difficult for the motor industry as military contracts were cancelled and military vehicles no longer required for service were sold onto the market at low prices. Guy returned to the civilian market, deciding to make luxury cars with a design by R. H. Rose, also from Sunbeam. They produced the Guy 8-cylinder car, powered by the first British V8 engine and featuring horizontal side valves.Guy, Anthony E., The Illustrated History of Guy Trucks and Buses Haynes Publishing Group, Around 25 of these were made and it was joined by a smaller model in 1922 with the 2465 cc four-cylinder 16.9 hp. A cheaper model followed in 1924 with the 1954 cc 13/36 with an engine from Coventry Climax. About 110 of the 4-cylinder models are thought to have been made. Production also continued on vehicles based on the 30cwt chassis such as the Guy charabanc and their major success the 30 seater bus. In 1924, the company adopted the slogan 'Feathers in our Cap' which led to the addition of a Native American mascot to their vehicles. 1924 also saw Guy produce the first-ever dropped-frame chassis for passenger vehicles (the B-type). This design allowed passengers to enter buses in a single step and became extremely popular, Guy receiving an order for 170 from Rio de Janeiro alone. Growing populations in towns and cities meant larger capacity buses were a necessity, leading Guy to develop a 6-wheeled version of their dropped-frame chassis, which allowed for the introduction of the first 6-wheeled double decker buses and 6-wheeled trolleybuses in 1926. Owen Silvers, the general manager of Wolverhampton Corporation, had pushed Guys to develop the 3-axle bus, and took delivery of the first production vehicle. He then convinced Guys to work with W. A. Stevens, who had developed the Tilling-Stevens petrol-electric bus, of which Wolverhampton had several, and Rees Roturbo Co Ltd, who were also based in Wolverhampton, on the design of a trolleybus. Guys modified their 3-axle chassis, fitting a single Rees-Stevens electric motor at the front of the chassis. Rees Roturbo produced the regenerative control system. The first BTX vehicle, with an open rear staircase, was tested on the Wolverhampton system in December 1926, and Silvers placed an order for a further 58, with enclosed staircases. The Hastings Tramway Co ordered 50 single-deck BTX trolleybuses and eight open-top double-deck versions, while Rotherham ordered five. Guy double decker buses and trolleybuses would prove popular, with a fleet of double deckers sold to the London Public Omnibus Company and exports supplied all around the world. Exports served as a major source of income for Guy with sales to South Africa, Pakistan, India and the Netherlands, their armoured vehicles proving particularly popular for covering difficult terrain, with 100 supplied to the Indian government in 1928. Guy's first military vehicle produced in 1923 In 1928, Guy took control of fellow Wolverhampton manufacturer the Star Motor Company, who had seen declining sales throughout the decade, in an attempt to expand their luxury car manufacturing. Under Guy, Star Motors moved to a new factory in Bushbury and the range of vehicles was narrowed to prevent competition against itself. Despite this, Star continued to struggle and a loss was made on every car sold. The Wall Street Crash had a crippling effect on industry and the subsequent recession meant that Guy could no longer afford to fit out Star's Bushbury plant and, in 1932, that company entered receivership. Despite performing well throughout the decade, by the end of the 1920s Guy was facing an uncertain future, due to the expensive takeover of Star and the Wall Street Crash, which had seen its share prices fall from one pound to one shilling (5p). =1930s= Guy was able to endure the Depression due to orders from the War Office and by taking advantage of the 1930 Road Traffic Act which encouraged the development of lighter vehicles.Burke, Roy,\\"Some reflections on the 1930 Road Traffic Act in practice\\", Published March 2012, Retrieved 16 August 2012 They produced a 2-axle version of the BTX trolleybus, known as the BT model, in 1930, which was available with a double deck body, or a single deck body, and also produced some chassis for export to Delhi. In 1933, the Arab bus chassis, designed for use with diesel engines, was launched and would prove a mainstay of Guy's success for the next twenty years. From the mid-1930s, the company became increasingly involved in the British re-armament programme, developing and producing military vehicles. In 1935, Guy submitted their new four-wheel Ant armoured car to military trials, where it impressed so much that 150 were ordered by the government. After this success, Guy began to concentrate solely on the production of military vehicles and, by 1938, Guy relied exclusively on Government contracts and had ended civilian production. During this time, Guy designed a new armoured car, the Quad Ant, which was welded rather than rivetted together. The original official contract specified that it had to be designed as a rivetted vehicle riveted construction, but Guy had suggested welding as being more suitable and effective. To that end, they developed the necessary techniques, including rotating jigs, which meant that the bodies and turrets could be produced more quickly and cheaply. This new development made armoured vehicles much safer and is reported to have eventually saved the British government ¬£100 million pounds, earning Guy a commendation from the Royal Commission. Initially though, the government's technical advisors were sceptical that welding armour plate, using these techniques, would be economical, so Guy offered to weld the first batch ordered, and if unsuccessful, to stand the cost. The vehicles were welded, and on examination by the British Army, the welding was found to have worked extremely well. Over time, it was further developed and became widely used in allied armoured vehicles, such as later models of the Churchill and Sherman tanks. By the time World War II started, Guys had built a total of 376 trolleybus chassis, but manufacture was then suspended until 1947. The Arab Mark IV, Guy's most successful bus design =Second World War= Guy armoured vehicles were used throughout the war, featuring prominently at the evacuation of Dunkirk and in the North African campaign. Although production of the Ant and Quad Ant were moved to Karrier, the factory was still involved in the war-effort, producing anti-aircraft guns. Car and commercial vehicle production in the UK virtually ceased during the war and buses were wearing out, being damaged and destroyed. The Ministry of War Transport was forced to arrange the production of buses/trolleybuses to maintain public services. It approached Guy to produce the first of more than 2,000 Guy double-deck buses which entered service between 1942 and 1945. The Ministry of War Supply ordered Guy to produce a chassis suitable for double-deck buses, the Blitz having resulted in a shortage of buses. In 1942, Guy launched the Arab I, then Arab II utility double deck bus, based on their original 1933 design, but with a frame of identical shape to the Leyland Titan TD8. Parts originally made of aluminium and other parts essential for the war effort were replaced by steel and iron. It was immediately successful, due to its robustness, reliability and low running costs.Pettie, Jasper, \\"Guy Buses in Camera\\", Published by Ian Allan Ltd., The company's contribution to the war effort established it as a leading supplier for the government and meant financial stability when heading into the post-war years. =Post-War years= After the war, Guy returned to civilian production, with bus production remaining a mainstay and retaining a strong emphasis on export sales to their major markets, including South Africa, Pakistan and the Netherlands. In 1947, Guy received orders for 70 BTX from Belfast, which were fitted with electical equipment by GEC, and 50 BT models for Wolverhampton, which carried BTH electrical equpiment. Guy had by then built 496 trolleybus chassis, but in 1948, they acquired Sunbeam Commercial Vehicles Limited and from then on, all trolleybuses produced (except some for UK operators carrying Karrier badges) carried the Sunbeam name. Trolleybuses continued to sell well, with the Sunbeam becoming the most popular model in South Africa. The Sunbeam Double-Decker Trolleybus Sunbeam trolleybuses had been built at Sunbeam's Moorfields Works, enabling Guy to concentrate on motorbuses and lorries at their Fallings Park Works, but in 1953 they completed the construction of new assembly shops next to their existing works, and Moorfields Works was closed, with trolleybus production moving to Fallings Park. Guy continued to update their old models, introducing a new version of the Otter chassis in 1950 for 30-seater vehicles and 84 were ordered by London Transport. By 1954, Guy passenger vehicles were operated by 150 companies in the UK and in 26 countries abroad. The company developed the first two-axle double-deck trolleybus chassis in 1954, the Sunbeam F4A, which could seat 68 passengers. In 1957, Sydney Guy retired after 43 years with the company. Guy continued to develop new and very successful models of chassis, introducing updated versions of the Otter and Warrior models and the high performance Victory chassis. However, an ill-advised decision to take South African sales in-house, which involved leasing the vehicles, rather than outright sales, proved an extreme strain on the company's finances, as there were many defaulting contracts. This, combined with their new double-decker chassis, the Wulfrunian, would prove highly damaging for Guy's future. Launched in 1958, the Wulfrunian included many innovations in its design, but, crucially, lacked the thorough testing necessary before marketing it, resulting in poor reliability upon which Guy had built its name.Cox, Roger Cox, \\"West Riding Guy Wulfrunians\\", Published July 2011, Retrieved August 2012 =The decline of the company= Guy Arab V (1963) Although new designs such as the Warrior Mark II were being produced and despite the fact that their lorry division was performing well, by 1960, Guy faced seemingly insurmountable financial problems.Hannay, R.N., \\"Guy Motors and The Wulfrunian\\", Published by The Transport Publishing Company, The failure of the Wulfrunian was a commercial disaster and the operation in South Africa was losing them ¬£300,000 a year. By 1961, Guy had no choice but to enter receivership. Sir William Lyons, managing director of Jaguar, acquired the company for ¬£800,000, transferring its assets to a new company, Guy Motors (Europe) Limited, which left all the liabilities with the now defunct Guy Motors Limited, the name eventually reverting to \\"Guy Motors Ltd\\" in 1966. Jaguar immediately set about rationalisation, reducing both the number of employees and the range of vehicles in production. Guy Big J4 (1972) Guy continued to be successful throughout the 1960s, with the development of the Victory trambus and the Big J series of trucks. The Big J was designed around a new, high-revving Cummins V6-200 engine coupled to a 12-speed splitter-type gearbox, and was intended for motorway operation. The reliability shortcomings and poor fuel economy of the Cummins V6-200 engine soon saw it replaced by engines from other sources. For example, AEC AV505, Leyland O.401, Gardner 6LXB, Cummins NH180/NTK265 and Rolls-Royce Eagle 220/265 were popular choices dependent on Gross Vehicle Weight. Gearboxes were sourced from AEC, David Brown and Fuller. Rear axles were selectable from ENV and Kirkstall Forge offerings. Such were the permutation of fitments that each vehicle's configuration was recorded on an \\"Erection Sheet\\" which, in the pre-internet age, was mailed from the factory to Guy dealers to have a record of each vehicle that may require attention in his workshop. The distinctive, non-tilt cab was sourced from Motor Panels. However a series of mergers by their parent company had left them in a precarious situationWheeler, Brian,\\"The Politics of Building Cars, Published 7 April 2005, Retrieved 16 August 2012 In 1966, Jaguar had merged with the British Motor Corporation to form British Motor Holdings. This company had then merged with Leyland in 1968, to form the British Leyland Motor Corporation. Leyland ceased the production of Guy-badged buses in 1972, although Leyland-badged versions of the Guy Victory were produced at Wolverhampton and Leyland until 1986. Despite the mergers, the British motor industry continued on a generally downward trend and British Leyland looked for where it could make savings.Adams, Keith, \\"Michael Edwardes Arrives\\", Published 25 August 2011, Retrieved 16 August 2012 Guy Motors was able to postpone closure, in part due to the success of its Big J range, because it was one of the few companies owned by British Leyland operating at a profit. Nevertheless, in 1981, Leyland took the debatable decision to close the Fallings Park plant, as part of a rationalisation drive and, in August 1982, the doors were shut at the cost of 740 jobs. On 5 October, the factory was stripped clean and the contents auctioned off. The closure of Guy Motors had a devastating effect on the factory's neighbouring areas, including Heath Town and Low Hill, where many of the company's workers lived, contributing to a rise in the already high unemployment in these areas.

Pierre Fran√ßois Xavier de Ram (September 2, 1804, Leuven ‚Äì May 14, 1865, Leuven), was a Belgian papal prelate, Canon and historian, best known for being the first rector of the new Catholic University of Belgium, founded in Mechelen in 1834, which in 1835 moved to Leuven as the Catholic University of Leuven. Biography De Ram entered the seminary at Mechelen, where he was ordained in 1827. He was appointed professor of poetry at the seminary of Mechelen and archivist of the diocese. During the period when King William I was carrying on his campaign against the Catholic faith and traditions of the Belgians, and while de Ram was still young, he took an active part in the struggle maintained by the Belgian clergy against the government of the Netherlands, republishing eighteenth century works, in which, in a series of historical studies refuting the doctrines of Joseph II, he combatted the latter's disciple, King William I. He was next appointed keeper of the diocesan records and professor in the episcopal seminary at Mechelen. In order to stay the spread of Protestantism in the Netherlands he collaborated with a movement for the publishing of religious works, bringing out Levens van de voornaemste Heyligen en roemweerdige peersonen der Nederlanden (Lives of the most prominent saints and celebrities of the Netherlands). His chief study for many years was hagiography, and he published an edition of Butler's Lives of the Saints (Leuven, 1828‚Äì35). Between 1828 and 1858 appeared the Synodicon Belgicum, a collection of unpublished documents upon the ecclesiastical history of the Netherlands since Philip II (Leuven, 4 vols., in quarto). During the years immediately before the Revolution of 1830, de Ram, who was much influenced by Lamennais, was active in bringing about a coalition of Liberals and Catholics against the Dutch government established by the Powers on the fall of Napoleon, and in endeavoring to give a democratic character to the policy of his church. He declined to stand as a member of the Belgian assembly, and applied himself wholly to teaching and to editing or composing historical books. De Ram was an active member of the Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium and a foreign associate of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. When the monumental project of the Acta Sanctorum, interrupted in 1794, was resumed by the so-called New Bollandists in 1838, De Ram, who as a young man had bought the whole corpus ‚Äì to this time 53 volumes in folio ‚Äì and who himself was considered as a possible member of the board of editors,The copy of De Ram‚Äôs Acta Sanctorum, whose library was sold after his death in 1865, first came to the F√ºrstlich F√ºrstenbergische Hofbibliothek Donaueschingen, which was sold in 1999. Now De Rams copy is in private ownership in the South of Germany. gave his expert opinion to the Commission royale d‚Äôhistoire of the Royal Academy recommending warmthly the prosecution of the much discussed project.Pierre Fran√ßois Xavier De Ram, Les nouveaux Bollandistes. Rapport fait a la Commission royale d‚Äôhistoire. Hayez, Bruxelles 1860 (also in: Bulletins de la Commission royale d‚Äôhistoire, 3. s√©rie, Bd. II 1, 1860.) As professor of philosophy at Mechelen he succeeded in bringing about the foundation of the Catholic University of Mechlin in 1834. This new university stayed only briefly in Mechelen, as the bishops already moved the university headquarters to Leuven on 1 December 1835, where it took the name Catholic University of Leuven, after the suppression of the State University of Leuven, where many professors from the old university had taught. This led to further consternation among the Belgian liberal society, which was afraid to see this new (conservative) university usurp the past of the former Old University of Leuven.According to Maurice Voituron, who wrote in his Le parti lib√©ral jou√© par le parti catholique dans la question de l'enseignement sup√©rieur, (Brussels, 1850): \\"et alors aurait paru plus √©vidente encore aux yeux du pays l'intention du parti catholique de tuer l'enseignement de l'√âtat, afin de ne laisser debout que l'Universit√© catholique de Malines, qui allait prendre le titre d'Universit√© de Louvain, pour y usurper la renomm√©e de l'ancienne, ainsi que ses fondations de bourses. Cependant, malgr√© lui, le parti catholique laissa √©chapper cet espoir par la bouche de son rapporteur M. Dechamps, lorsqu'il disait : \\"la confiance entourera de telle fa√ßon les √©tablissements priv√©s que les Universit√©s de l'√âtat, par exemple, deviendront √† peu pr√®s d√©sertes\\" It also reinvigorated demands for the foundation of a secular university in Brussels which would lead to the foundation of the Free University of Brussels. De Ram was rector of the new Catholic University of Louvain founded in Mechlin in 1834 till his death in 1865.

It consists of a sheet of a fire retardant material which is placed over a fire in order to smother it. Small fire blankets, such as for use in kitchens and around the home are usually made of fiberglass and sometimes kevlar, and are folded into a quick-release contraption for ease of storage. Fire blankets, along with fire extinguishers, are fire safety items that can be useful in case of a fire. These nonflammable blankets are helpful in temperatures up to 900 degrees and are useful in smothering fires by not allowing any oxygen to the fire. Due to its simplicity, a fire blanket may be more helpful for someone who is inexperienced with fire extinguishers. Larger fire blankets, for use in laboratory and industrial situations, are often made of wool (sometimes treated with a flame retardant fluid). These blankets are usually mounted in vertical quick-release container so that they can be easily pulled out and wrapped round a person whose clothes are on fire. Dangers = Asbestos in old blankets = Some older fire blankets were made of woven asbestos fibers and are not NFPA rated. This can pose a hazard during the decommissioning of old equipment. = Extinguishing oil/fat fires = After initial investigation in 2013, and later in 2014, the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority issued a statement that fire blankets should never be used to extinguish an oil/fat fire such as a chip pan fire, even if the icons or text on the blanket indicates the blanket may be used in such a case.http://www.vwa.nl/txmpub/files/?p_file_id=2207490 This includes fire blankets which have been tested according to BS EN 1869.https://www.nvwa.nl/txmpub/files/?p_file_id=2204607 In the investigation out of the 22 tested fire blankets, 16 of the fire blankets themselves caught fire. In the other 6 the fire reignited when the blanket was removed after 17 minutes. The Dutch Fire Burn foundation reported several accidents involving the use of fire blankets when extinguishing oil/fat fires. Consumers may send in their existing fire blankets, which will then receive a sticker stating 'niet geschikt voor olie- en vetbranden' (\\"not suitable for oil- and fat fires\\"). New products will have this text printed, rather than stickered. Operation For a fire to burn, all three elements of the fire triangle must be present: heat, fuel and oxygen. The fire blanket is used to cut off the oxygen supply to the fire, thereby putting it out. The fire blanket must be sealed closely to a solid surface around the fire. Fire blankets usually have two pull down tails visible from outside the packaging. The user should place one hand on each tag and pull down simultaneously removing the blanket from the bag. The tails are located near the top of the fire blanket which allows the top lip of the fire blanket to fold back over the users' hands, protecting them from heat and direct contact burns. Cover the fire with the fire blanket, and it will help cut the oxygen supply and extinguish the fire. You can also use this method when a part of the body catches fire. The fire blanket must be sealed closely to a solid surface around the fire. Maintenance The Fire Industry Association (FIA) publish a \\"Code of Practice for the Commissioning and Maintenance of Fire Blankets Manufactured to BS EN 1869\\". The FIA's code of practice recommends that the responsible person ensures that such fire blankets are subject to annual maintenance by a competent service provider. It also recommends that consideration should be given to the replacement of fire blankets after seven years from the date of commissioning (or as otherwise specified by the fire blanket's manufacturer).

The original Silver Palm was an intrastate train, operating between Miami and Tampa. Service began in 1982 and ended in 1985. The second was an extension of the existing Palmetto service in the late 1990s.  History  = Intrastate train = The Silver Palm at Tampa in March 1983 Amtrak introduced the first Silver Palm as a single round trip service between Miami and Tampa, Florida, on November 21, 1982. The train was subsidized by the Florida Department of Transportation as a 403(b) service. The train operated over the tracks of the Seaboard System Railroad between Miami and Tampa via Auburndale. The northbound train departed Miami in the morning and returned from Tampa in the afternoon. Travel time was approximately five hours in each direction. A bus connection was provided between and . It followed the traditional SAL mainline through Wildwood and Ocala in north-central Florida. The Silver Palm was the first intrastate train to use the then-new Amfleet II coaches. The initial consist was two coaches and a cafe car. During its service, train crew were required to manually throw switches for the train to operate between divisions. Amtrak had worked to remove speed restrictions on the line and considered adding more stops in an effort to improve service and increase the train's profitability. The state also tried to help boost ridership following a publicity tour by then Lieutenant Governor Wayne Mixson in August 1984, in part to build a base of riders for proposed high-speed service in the state. After a two-year trial the Florida Department of Transportation recommended ending subsidies for the Silver Palm. State law required that state-sponsored services maintain a farebox ratio of 60% to continue funding. FDOT announced on October 20, 1984 that the Silver Palm's ratio was 45.3%. The service was scheduled to be discontinued on November 20, 1984. The Florida Coalition of Rail Passengers sued the state, arguing that the Department of Transportation had calculated the operating ratio incorrectly, and won at the district court level. This decision was overturned on appeal by the Florida First District Court of Appeal on March 28, 1985. The Silver Palm was discontinued on April 30, 1985. It was estimated to have lost $4 million over the course of its run. = Long- distance train = Map of Amtrak Silver Service train routes The second Silver Palm was a long-distance passenger train between New York, New York, and Miami, Florida. This was a revival of the Palmetto, which Amtrak had discontinued on April 1, 1995. Service began on November 10, 1996. For a period in the mid-1990s, as in the 1996-1997 season, it was Amtrak's only train passing through Ocala area north-central Florida section in 1996.Amtrak Timetable, November, 1996 p. 29 http://www.timetables.org/full.php?group=19961110n&item;=0029 Amtrak restored the Palmetto name on May 1, 2002, after the train lost sleeping and dining car service.

It became defunct in 1996, when it was taken over by MasterCard. History The Access card was introduced in the United Kingdom by a consortium consisting of National Westminster Bank, Midland Bank (now HSBC UK) and Lloyds Bank, later joined by Williams & Glyn's Bank (now RBS) as a rival to the established Barclaycard. It was established as a joint venture incorporated as The Joint Credit Card Company Limited with Lloyds, Midland and National Westminster banks each owning 30% and Williams & Glyn's owning 10%. The Access name was registered as a trademark on 26 November 1971http://www.accesscreditcard.info/history66-72.aspx and the product was launched on 23 October 1972. In Scotland, the card was issued by Williams & Glyn's sister company, The Royal Bank of Scotland and by Clydesdale Bank, then a subsidiary of Midland Bank. In Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it was issued by Ulster Bank, a subsidiary of NatWest and by Northern Bank, at the time a subsidiary of Midland. The business was run from several offices in Southend-on-Sea in Essex. The scheme participated in the Eurocard/MasterCard systems. Europay International has since been taken over by MasterCard International.

He was the son of Stella A. Sharp and Paul Frederic Bennewitz, Sr. (1900-1949). Overview Bennewitz claimed the existence of a plot involving an extensive network of UFO bases tied to an alien colonization and control scheme to subjugate the human race. After he saw the hypnosis sessions of Myrna Hansen, who claimed to have UFO experiences, he became convinced that cattle mutilations were due to aliens. As a result, Bennewitz claimed to have uncovered evidence of aliens controlling humans through electromagnetic devices, and furthermore claimed that UFOs were regularly flying near Kirtland Air Force Base and the nearby Manzano Nuclear Weapons Storage Facility and Coyote Canyon Test Area. Convinced that he was intercepting electronic communications originating from alien spacecraft located outside of Albuquerque, New Mexico, Bennewitz soon believed that he had located a secret alien facility that he called Dulce Base. By 1982, Bennewitz began to spread his ideas regarding Dulce Base to others in the UFOlogy community. In 1988 he wrote a paper entitled \\"Project Beta\\" detailing how the base might be successfully attacked. Bennewitz detailed his assertions to the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, who regarded him as a deluded paranoid. UFOlogist William Moore claims that he tried to push Bennewitz, who had been in a mental health facility on three occasions after suffering severe delusional paranoia, into a mental breakdown by feeding him false information about aliens. In 1988, his family checked him into a psychiatric facility. Former special agent for the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations Richard Doty claimed that in the 1980s he was tasked with hoaxing documents and feeding false information to UFO researchers, including Bennewitz.

Military deception (MILDEC) refers to attempts by a military unit to gain an advantage during warfare by misleading adversary decision makers into taking actions detrimental to the adversary. This is usually achieved by creating or amplifying an artificial fog of war via psychological operations, information warfare, visual deception, or other methods. As a form of disinformation, it overlaps with psychological warfare. Military deception is also closely connected to operations security (OPSEC) in that OPSEC attempts to conceal from the adversary critical information about an organization's capabilities, activities, limitations, and intentions, or provide a plausible alternate explanation for the details the adversary can observe, while deception reveals false information in an effort to mislead the adversary. Deception in warfare dates back to early history. The Art of War, an ancient Chinese military treatise, emphasizes the importance of deception as a way for outnumbered forces to defeat larger adversaries. Examples of deception in warfare can be found in Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, the Medieval Age, the Renaissance, and the European Colonial Era. Deception was employed during World War I and came into even greater prominence during World War II. In modern times, the militaries of several nations have evolved deception tactics, techniques and procedures into fully fledged doctrine. Types Dummy airbase and mock aircraft Military deception may take place at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare. The five basic tactics include: ; Diversion : Use of feints, demonstrations, displays, or ruses to draw the enemy's attention away from a friendly main effort and induce the enemy to concentrate resources at a time and place that is to the enemy's disadvantage. : Example: On the night August 17 and 18, 1943, the British Air Force carried out Operation Hydra, the bombing of a rocket research center at Peenem√ºnde, a German town on the Baltic Sea. Over a period of time, the British had conditioned the Germans to expect and respond to attacks on Berlin by sending de Havilland Mosquito bombers along the same route towards the city. When the British executed Operation Hydra, the Germans believed eight Mosquitoes flying towards Berlin were the vanguard of yet another attack. As a result of this diversion, the Germans deployed the majority of their fighter aircraft over Berlin, which gave the British an advantage over Peenem√ºnde. ; Feint : An offensive action involving force-on- force contact with the adversary which deceives the adversary as to the location and/or time of the friendly side's main effort. A feint will cause the enemy to concentrate resources at an incorrect time and location. A series of feints will condition the enemy to friendly activities in the same location, causing the enemy to lower their guard or respond ineffectively to the friendly main effort. : Example: In May 1940, Nazi Germany's Army Group B attacked the Netherlands and Belgium. At the same time, Army Group A invaded France by attacking through the Ardennes towards the city of Sedan. Army Group B's attack was a feint intended to disguise Germany's main effort from British and French military leaders. ; Demonstration : A demonstration presents a show of force similar to a feint, but with the intent of avoiding actual force-on- force contact with the adversary. The intent of a demonstration is for the adversary to incorrectly determine the time and location of the friendly main effort, which gives the friendly side an advantage by causing the adversary to incorrectly allocate resources, move to the wrong location, or fail to move. : Example: During the Peninsula campaign of the American Civil War, Union commander George B. McClellan believed he faced a stronger Confederate force commanded by John B. Magruder than he actually did. Magruder reinforced McClellan's perception with numerous demonstrations, including parading his soldiers where they could be viewed by Union observers, moving them out of sight, and then parading them again within sight of McClellan's observers. McClellan concluded that he was outnumbered and decided to retreat. ; Ruse : The deliberate exposure to the enemy of false information that causes the enemy to reach an incorrect conclusion about friendly intentions and capabilities. A ruse is a trick of warfare that relies on guile to contribute to a larger deception plan. : Example: The creation of the fictional Major William Martin (\\"The Man Who Never Was\\") as a British officer carrying important World War II battle plans. As part of the Operation Mincemeat deception that concealed the location of the planned Allied invasion of Sicily, the Allies intended for the Nazis to acquire the false documents, which indicated a planned Allied invasion of Greece and the Balkans, and then incorrectly allocate troops and materiel. ; Display : The static portrayal of activity, troops, or equipment. A display is intended to deceive the adversary‚Äôs visual observation capability, causing him to believe the friendly force is in a location other than where it is, that it has a capacity or capability it does not possess, or that it does not have a capacity or capability that it does possess. : Example: The Allied use use of \\"sunshields\\" in Operation Bertram and inflatable decoys in Operation Bodyguard during World War II to deceive the enemy as to the size, location and objectives of Allied forces. These basic deception tactics are often used in combination with each other as part of a larger deception plan. Axioms and principles The development of modern military deception doctrine has led to the codification of several rules and maxims. In U.S. doctrine, three of the most important are expressed as Magruder's Principle, the Jones' Dilemma, and Care In the Placement of Deceptive Material (Avoid Windfalls). Magruder's Principle: Named for Confederate general John B. Magruder, this principle states that it usually easier to deceive a deception target into holding on to a pre-existing belief than it is to convince the target that something the target believes to be true is not. Examples include the Allies of World War II making use in the Operation Mincemeat deception of the pre-existing German belief that Greece and the Balkans would be their next invasion target after North Africa, when the Allies actually intended to invade Sicily. Jones' Dilemma: Named for British scientist Reginald Victor Jones, who played an important role in the Allied effort during World War II, the Jones dilemma indicates that the greater the number of intelligence and information gathering and transmitting resources available to the deception target, the more difficult it is to deceive the target. Conversely, the more of the target's intelligence and information systems that are manipulated in a deception plan or denied to the target, the more likely the target is to believe the deception. One reason the World War II Operation Bodyguard deception was accepted as true on the German side is that Germany's ability to acquire information about activities in England was limited, enabling the Allies to manipulate the few German intelligence gathering resources that were available. Avoid Windfalls: If a deception target obtains deceptive information too easily (\\"too good to be true\\"), the target is unlikely to act on it and the deception will fail. This requires deception planners to take care in placing deceptive information so that it will appear to have been acquired in a seemingly natural manner. The deception target is then able to assemble details from multiple sources into a coherent, believable, but untrue story. The best deception plans co-opt the enemy's skepticism through requiring enemy participation, either by expending time and resources in obtaining the deceptive information, or by devoting significant effort to interpreting it. In an example of valid information being dismissed as a windfall, early in World War II a plane carrying German officers to Cologne became lost in bad weather and landed in Belgium. Before being arrested by Belgian authorities, the Germans attempted to burn the papers they were carrying, which included copies of the actual invasion plans for Belgium and the Netherlands. Belgian authorities discounted this true information as false because of the ease with which they obtained it. Planning process The doctrine for planning deception has been codified over time. In the U.S. military, this doctrine begins with understanding the deception target's cognitive process. Expressed as \\"See-Think-Do\\", this understanding of the adversary considers what information has to be conveyed to the target through what medium in order for the target to develop the perception of the situation that will cause the enemy to take an action beneficial to the friendly side. In the planning process, \\"See-Think-Do\\" is considered in reverse order -- what does the friendly side want the enemy to do as a result of the deception, what perceptions will the target have to form in order to take the action, and what information needs to be transmitted to the target through which medium so that the target will develop the desired perception? As an example, the intent for Operation Bodyguard was for Germany to allocate forces away from Normandy (\\"Do\\"). The perception the Allies wanted to create in the mind of the deception target (Hitler) was that the Allies were planning to invade at Calais (\\"Think\\"). The information the Allies conveyed to the target to create the perception included the false radio traffic, dummy equipment displays, and command messages of the fictional First United States Army Group (\\"See\\"). History =Ancient Egypt= According to a story from an ancient Egyptian papyrus, in about 1450 BC, an Egyptian army under Pharaoh Thutmose III and his general Djehuty besieged the Caananite city of Yapu (later Joppa and now Jaffa). Unable to gain entry, they resorted to deception. Djehuty hid several soldiers in baskets and had the baskets delivered to the town with the message that the Egyptians were admitting defeat and sending tribute. The people of Yapu accepted the gift and celebrated the end of the siege. Once inside the city, the hidden soldiers emerged from the baskets, opened the city gates, and admitted the main Egyptian force. The Egyptians then conquered the city. =Ancient Greece= The Iliad and The Odyssey, epic poems composed between the 9th and 6th centuries BC, are credited to the Ancient Greek author Homer. These poems contain details of the Trojan War, presumed by the Greeks to have been fought in approximately the 13th century BC. The Odyssey provides the details of the Trojan Horse, a successfully executed deception. After several years of stalemate, The Greek leader Odysseus devised a ruse. Over three days, the Greeks constructed a hollow wooden horse, which they inscribed as an offering to the goddess Athena in prayer for safe return to their homes. The Greeks then pretended to depart the area around Troy, giving the impression that they had sailed for Greece. Rather than risk offending Athena, the Trojans brought the horse into the city. That night, Greek soldiers concealed inside the horse came out of their hiding place and opened the city gates. The main force of Greek soldiers who had actually remained nearby then entered the city and killed the inhabitants. =Ancient Macedon= In 326 BC, the army of Macedon, which was led by Alexander the Great, had advanced through the Middle East to Asia, conquering numerous kingdoms along the way. Alexander planned for battle against the forces of Porus, the king of the region of Pakistan and India that is now Punjab. To confront Porus, Alexander needed to cross the Hydaspes River. Porus used the terrain to his advantage and arranged his forces to prevent Alexander from crossing the river at the most likely fording point. Leading up to the battle, Alexander scouted several alternative fords, but Porus moved each time to counter him. Alexander eventually located a suitable crossing point approximately 17 miles north of his base. He then led a portion of his army to the crossing site, while his subordinate Craterus kept the entire army's campfires burning within sight of Porus and feigned several river crossings that Porus was able to observe. With Porus distracted, Alexander successfully led his detachment across the river, then marched south to engage in battle. In the Battle of the Hydaspes, Alexander's army had the element of surprise and quickly defeated Porus' troops, while sustaining relatively few casualties on the Macedonian side. Having conquered Porus' kingdom, Alexander then allowed Porus to rule his former kingdom as one of Alexander's satraps. =Ancient China= In 341 BC, troops under the general Sun Bin of the state of Qi faced battle with the forces of the state of Wei. Knowing that Wei regarded the army of Qi as inferior and cowardly, Sun Bin decided to use Wei's perception to his advantage. When Qi's forces invaded Wei, Sun Bin ordered them to light 100,000 camp fires. On the second day, they lit 50,000. On the third day, they lit 30,000. Sun Bin's deception caused the Wei forces led by general Pang Juan to believe Qi faced mass desertions. Rushing to attack what they believed to be an inferior army, the Wei forces assaulted Qi's troops at a narrow gorge, not knowing Sun Bin's soldiers had prepared it as an ambush site. When Pang Juan's troops reached the gorge they observed that a sign had been posted. Lighting a torch to see the message, The Wei commander read \\"Pang Juan dies beneath this tree\\". The lighting of the torch was the signal for Qi to initiate the ambush. Sun Bin's army quickly routed Pang Juan's and Pang Juan committed suicide. Another well-known deceptive measure from ancient China has come to be known as the Empty Fort Strategy. Employed several times in numerous conflicts, the best-known example is a fictional one contained in a historical novel from the 1320s AD, Romance of the Three Kingdoms. This work, which contains tales of Chinese history from 169 to 280 AD, includes the story of general Zhuge Liang of Shu Han employing the Empty Fort Strategy. As recounted in the novel's description of Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions, an actual historical event, the forces of general Sima Yi of Cao Wei arrived at Zhuge Liang's location, the city of Xicheng, while the bulk of Zhuge Liang's army was deployed elsewhere. Zhuge Liang instructed the few troops he had on hand to pretend to be townspeople and told them to perform tasks which would make them visible to Sima Yi, including sweeping the town's streets. Zhuge Liang ordered Xichneg's gates to be opened, then took up a visible position on a viewing platform, playing his Guqin while flanked by only two pages. Because Zhuga Liang's reputation as a military leader was so great, Sima Yi assumed Zhuge Liang had prepared an ambush, so he declined to enter Xicheng. Zhuge Liang's deception saved the town and prevented the few soldiers he had with him from being massacred or taken prisoner. =Ancient Carthage= During the Second Punic War, the Carthaginian general Hannibal employed deception during the Battle of Cannae in 216 BC. In preparing to face a Roman force led by Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Terentius Varro, Hannibal had 40,000 soldiers, as compared to the over 80,000 that had been amassed by Rome. To overcome the Roman advantage in numbers, Hannibal placed his less experienced and disciplined Gauls in the center of his formation, arranged to bulge out towards the Romans. On either side of his line, Hannibal positioned his experienced and disciplined Libyan and Gaetuli infantry. Hannibal intended for the Gauls to give way to the advancing Romans, with the center of his line bending but not breaking. Seeing the Gauls appear to retreat, the Romans would advance into the bowl shape or sack created by the bending of Hannibal's line. Once inside the sack, the African infantry positioned on the left and right would wheel inwards and attack the Roman flanks. In combination with the Carthaginian cavalry, the infantry on the flanks would continue moving until they encircled the Romans and could attack their rear. The battle unfolded as Hannibal had envisioned. Only 10,000 Romans escaped, with the rest either killed or captured. The battle came to be seen as evidence of Hannibal's genius for tactical generalship, while it was among the worst defeats suffered by Ancient Rome. =Ancient Rome= During the Gallic Wars, in 52 BC Roman commander Julius Caesar attempted to engage the forces of tribal leader Vercingetorix in open battle in what is now central France. Vercingetorix kept the River Elave (now Allier) between Caesar's forces and his own. His troops destroyed or removed the bridges and mirrored the movements of Caesar's troops, preventing Caesar from crossing the river. Caesar responded by hiding forty of his sixty cohorts and arranging the remaining twenty to give the appearance of sixty as viewed from the opposite riverbank. The twenty cohorts continued to march along the river, and Vercingetorix's troops continued to mirror their movements. Caesar then led the forty hidden cohorts back to a repairable bridge, had it fixed, led his troops across, and sent for the other twenty cohorts to rejoin him. Now on the same side of the river as Vercingetorix, Cesar was able to engage the Gallic tribes in battle as he intended. =Mongol Empire= The Mongol Empire frequently used deception to aid its military success. A favored tactic was to exaggerate the size of their army, which would cause their enemies to surrender or flee. When he fought the Naimans in 1204, Chinggis Khan ordered his soldiers to light five campfires each, giving the impression of a more numerous army. In 1258 M√∂ngke Khan invaded Szechuan with 40,000 soldiers, and spread rumors of 100,000 in an effort to intimidate his enemy. When confronting numerically superior forces, the Mongols often sent troops behind their own lines to raise dust with branches tied to their horses' tails, which created the impression that reinforcements were en route. Mongol soldiers had more than one horse each, and to exaggerate the size of their army, they would compel prisoners or civilians to ride their spare horses within site of the enemy, or mount dummies on their spare horses. To make their forces appear smaller, the Mongols would ride in single file, minimizing dust and making the hoofprints of their horses more difficult to count. Mongol armies also used the feigned retreat. A typical tactic was to deploy the mangudai, a vanguard unit that would charge the enemy, break up its formation, and then retreat in an attempt to draw the enemy into a position more favorable to the Mongols. =Middle Ages= Examples of deception occurred during the Crusades. In 1271, Sultan Baybars captured the formidable Krak des Chevaliers by handing the besieged knights a letter, supposedly from their commander, ordering them to surrender. The letter was fake, but the knights believed it was genuine and capitulated. At about the same time, the Tudors of Wales were seeking a revocation of the price that Henry Percy had placed on their heads. After deciding to capture Percy's Conwy castle, one Tudor posed as a carpenter, gained access to the castle, and then admitted his compatriots. The successful deception was in part responsible for the creation of the Tudor dynasty. =Renaissance= In an event from the early 1480s that was recounted in Washington Irving's Conquest of Granada, during the Granada War, the Alhama de Granada was besieged by Moors. During the siege, a portion of the fortress' outer wall was destroyed after the earth beneath it was washed away in a violent storm. To conceal the breach, the Conde de Tendilla, leader of the Spanish defenders, directed the erection of a cloth screen. The screen deceived the Moors because it was painted to resemble stone, and no Moorish besiegers ventured close enough to spot the fakery. The wall was repaired over the next several days, and the Moors did not learn of the gap in the Alhama's defenses. Henry VIII of England led troops on the European mainland during the War of the League of Cambrai. On September 4, 1513, Henry's forces began to besiege the city of Tournai in what is now Belgium. The site of a thriving tapestry industry and home to many well-known painters, Tournai prolonged the siege by using painted canvas that resembled trenchworks to exaggerate the strength of its defenses. As a result of this deception, the city held out for several days longer than expected and obtained favorable terms when it surrendered. =Colonial Africa= In 1659, the kingdom of Denmark‚ÄìNorway constructed Fort Christiansborg near what is now Accra in Ghana. Used to control commerce in slaves, as well as raw materials including gold and ivory, the site changed hands several times between Denmark‚ÄìNorway, Portugal, and Sweden, sometimes by force, sometimes by purchase. In 1692, Nana Asamani, the king of the Akwamu people, planned to capture the fort from Denmark‚ÄìNorway. Disguising himself as a cook and interpreter, he obtained work at the fort, where over the next year he became proficient in the Danish language and conducted reconnaissance to learn about the activities of the facility's occupants and the people with whom they traded. After gaining familiarity with Fort Christiansborg's occupants and operations, in 1693 Asamani informed the Danish traders who occupied it about a group of Akwamu who desired to purchase weapons and ammunition, and suggested they were so anxious to buy that the Danes should inflate their prices. Lured by the prospect of large profits, the Danes bartered with the 80 Akwamu that Asamani had brought to the fort. When the Danes allowed the Akwamu to inspect rifles and prepare to test-fire them, the Akwamu instead used the guns to commence an attack on the Danes. Caught by surprise, the Danes were quickly overpowered and ejected from Fort Christiansborg. The Akwamu occupied the post for a year before Asamani agreed to sell it back to Denmark‚ÄìNorway. Asamani kept the keys as a trophy, and they are still in the possession of the Akwamu. =French and Indian War= During the French and Indian War, British commander James Wolfe attempted throughout the summer of 1759 to force French commander Louis-Joseph de Montcalm to come out of his well-defended position in Quebec City. When artillery fire that destroyed most of the city did not produce the desired effect, Wolfe employed a deception strategy called \\"uproar east, attack west\\" Wolfe ordered Admiral Charles Saunders to move the British fleet on the Saint Lawrence River to a position opposite one of Montcalm‚Äôs main camps east of Quebec City. This demonstration gave the appearance of preparations for an upcoming attack. Montcalm was deceived, and moved troops to guard against a British assault from that location. Wolfe's soldiers capitalized on the favorable balance of forces created by the deception. First, they opened a road from the riverbank to the city heights. Next, they deployed into battle formation on a farmer's field near the city walls. Caught by surprise, Montcalm knew he would not be able to withstand a siege and had no choice but to fight. In September 13, 1759's Battle of the Plains of Abraham, the French were decisively beaten. The loss of Quebec led to defeat in the war and France was forced to cede Canada to the British. =American Revolution= Siege of Boston As head of the Continental Army, George Washington successfully used deception to equalize the odds in the fight against the larger, better-equipped, and better-trained British army and its mercenary allies. During the Siege of Boston from April 1775 to March 1776, the newly-organized Continental Army suffered from numerous equipment and supply shortages. Among the most critical was a lack of gunpowder, which was so acute that in a battle, Washington's troops would be able to fire no more than nine bullets per man. To conceal the lack of gunpowder from the British, Washington's quartermaster soldiers filled gunpowder casks with sand and shipped them from Providence, Rhode Island to the Continental Army's depots. The deception fooled British spies, and British commanders decided not to risk an attack during the siege. Battle of Long Island After the Patriot defeat at the Battle of Long Island in late August 1776, Washington's forces retreated to Brooklyn Heights, with a superior British force surrounding them on three sides and their backs to the East River. The British expected Washington would find his position untenable and surrender. Washington instead arranged for a flotilla of small boats to ferry his 9,000 troops across the river to the relative safety of Manhattan Island. Moving under cover of darkness, Washington's troops withdrew unit by unit to avoid the appearance that a general retreat was taking place. The wheels of supply wagons and gun carriages were wrapped in rags to muffle their noise, and troops ordered to remain silent to avoid alerting the nearby British. Rear guard units kept campfires blazing through the night. These measures fooled British scouts into thinking the Patriot army was still on Brooklyn Heights. A morning fog obscured visibility, which helped the Continentals complete their retreat, and all 9,000 were safely ferried across the river. When the British advanced, they were surprised to find the American positions completely empty. Battle of Trenton Prior to the Battle of Trenton on Christmas Day 1776, Washington used a spy, John Honeyman to gain information about the positions of Britain's Hessian mercenaries. Posing as a Loyalist butcher and weaver, Honeyman traded with British and Hessian troops and acquired useful intelligence. At the same time, he aided Washington's plan by spreading disinformation that convinced the British and Hessians that Continental Army morale was low and an end-of-year attack against British positions unlikely.Van Dyke, John (1873), \\"An Unwritten Account of a Spy of Washington\\", Our Home Honeyman's deceptive information enabled Washington to gain the element of surprise, and his troops routed the stunned Hessians. Battle of Princeton After the Battle of Trenton, the British dispatched a large army under General Charles Cornwallis to chase down Washington's smaller force. At the January 2, 1777 Battle of the Assunpink Creek, the Continental troops under Washington successfully repulsed three British attacks on their positions. Darkness ended the British attacks and they planned to resume the following morning. That night, Washington again resorted to the same deceptive tactics he had used in Brooklyn, including muffling the wheels of wagons and gun carriages to reduce noise, and leaving a rear guard to keep campfires burning. The British were again fooled, and Washington was able to move his army into a position from which he defeated the British at the Battle of Princeton on January 3. Siege of Fort Stanwix In August 1777, the first Patriot attempt to relieve the Siege of Fort Stanwix, New York was blocked by the British as the result of the Battle of Oriskany. A second attempt, led by Benedict Arnold succeeded in part because of a successful effort to deceive the British besiegers. Arnold dispatched a messenger, Hon Yost Schuyler to the British lines. Schuyler was a Loyalist and regarded by the British army's Mohawk allies as a prophet because of his strange dress and conduct. To ensure his good conduct, Arnold held Schuyler's brother as a hostage. Upon reaching the British positions outside Fort Stanwix, Schuyler informed the Mohawk that Arnold's relief column was nearer than it was, and that it was much larger than it actually was. The Mohawk initially disbelieved Schuyler, but assumed he was telling the truth after other American Indian messengers sent by Arnold began to arrive with the same information. The Mohawk decided to leave, forcing British commander Barry St. Leger to order a retreat. The end of the siege also ended British attempts to control the Mohawk Valley. Battle of Cowpens In the fall of 1780, Continental Army general Nathanael Greene, commander of the Southern Department, carried out a harassment campaign against the British in North and South Carolina. One of Greene's subordinates, Daniel Morgan, commanded a force of approximately 600, and was tasked with harassing the enemy in the backcountry of South Carolina. In January 1781, as a British force commanded by Banastre Tarleton closed in on Morgan near Cowpens, South Carolina on the Broad River, he opted to fight rather than risk being attacked while attempting to cross the water. Knowing the British regarded Patriot militia as inferior, Morgan used this perception to his advantage by arranging his troops in three lines. The first was sharpshooters, who provided harassing fire and attempted to pick off British officers. The sharpshooters would then fall back to the second line, which would consist of militiamen. The militia would fire two volleys, then feign a rout and pretend to flee. If the British believed they had caused a panic in the militiamen, they would charge forward. But instead of catching up to the fleeing militia, they would run into the third line -- Continental Army soldiers commanded by John Eager Howard. As a reserve, Morgan had a small Continental cavalry force commanded by William Washington. Morgan's deception proved decisive. At the Battle of Cowpens on January 17, 1781, the British under Tarleton launched a frontal assault. The militia feigned retreat, and Tarleton's troops charged forward. As planned, they were met by Howard's troops, then surprised by Washington's cavalry charging into their flanks. The British lost over 100 killed, over 200 wounded, and over 500 captured. Morgan's command sustained only 12 killed and 60 wounded. =French Revolutionary Wars= Napoleon Bonaparte made significant use of deception during his campaigns. At the 1796 Battle of Lodi, he used deception to achieve a successful crossing of the River Po. As a diversion, Napoleon mounted a token crossing attempt against a strong Austrian force under Johann Peter Beaulieu. Meanwhile, the bulk of his force moved upriver and obtained an uncontested bridgehead at Piacenza. Once it had crossed the river, Napoleon's force attacked the enemy's rear guard in a tactic he referred to as manoeuvre sur les derri√®res (\\"maneuvering behind\\"). =War of the First Coalition= During the War of the First Coalition, France attempted an invasion of Britain. During the February 1797 Battle of Fishguard, Colonel William Tate an Irish-American commanding French and Irish troops, landed near Fishguard in Wales. English and Welsh militia and civilians under the command of John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor hastily assembled to defend the town. When discipline began to break down among Tate's troops and their attempted invasion slowed down, Tate asked for surrender terms that would permit his command to leave. Instead of offering terms, Cawdor demanded unconditional surrender. As Tate and his subordinates considered Cawdor's demands overnight, Cawdor backed up his bluff with several deceptive measures. According to local lore, these included having women in Traditional Welsh costumes and Welsh hats line the cliffs near the French camp. from a distance, the women appeared to be British soldiers in red coats and Shakos. Convinced that he was outnumbered, Tate surrendered and his troops were taken prisoner. =First Barbary War= In October, 1803 the frigate ran aground off the North African port of Tripoli during the First Barbary War and was captured by the Tripolitan forces. In February 1804, a U.S. military detachment under the command of Stephen Decatur Jr., was assigned to retrieve the ship or destroy it in order to keep Tripoli from putting it into service. The raiding party deceived the Tripolitan authorities by sailing into Tripoli harbor aboard , a captured Tripolitan ketch which they disguised as a Maltese merchant ship. The ship's Sicilian harbor pilot spoke to the Tripolitan authorities in Arabic, claimed the ship had lost its anchors in a storm, and sought permission to tie up next to the captured Philadelphia. Permission was granted and Decatur and his crew overwhelmed the small force guarding the Philadelphia, using only swords and pikes to avoid gunshots that would alert authorities on shore of their presence. Unable to sail the Philadelphia away, Decatur and his crew burned it, then safely escaped. =War of 1812= In a notable deception during the War of 1812's Siege of Detroit, British Major General Isaac Brock and Native American chief Tecumseh used a variety of tricks, including letters they allowed to be intercepted which exaggerated the size of their forces, disguising Brock's militia contingent as more fearsome regular army soldiers, and repeatedly marching the same body of Native American past U.S. observers to make it appear they were more numerous than they were. Though he had superior troop strength, the U.S. commander, Brigadier General William Hull, believed he faced overwhelming numbers of British regular troops and hordes of uncontrollable Indians. Fearing a massacre, Hull surrendered the town and attached fort. Most of his militia were allowed to return home, while his regular army soldiers were held as prisoners of war. =American Civil War= Peninsula campaign In the American Civil War's Peninsula campaign, Union commander George B. McClellan was the victim of a deception executed by the forces under Confederate commander John B. Magruder during the 1862 Siege of Yorktown. Magruder, who had acted in and produced plays, used his knowledge of visual and audio effects to deceive McClellan into believing Magruder's force was larger than it was. These included placing straw dummy crewmen alongside Quaker guns -- logs painted black to resemble cannons -- in his defensive works. Magruder interspersed his Quaker guns with the few real cannons he possessed, making his artillery seem more numerous than it was. In addition, he used shouted orders and bugle calls to march his relatively small force of about 10,000 in front of Union positions until they were out of sight, then had them loop around unseen and march through the same area again, making his troop strength seem greater than it was. Magruder's elaborate charade convinced McClellan, who outnumbered Magruder by ten to one, that he faced a more formidable opponent than was actually the case, which caused him to delay attacking. McClellan's delay allowed Confederate reinforcements to arrive, causing him to retreat back to Washington, D.C. Vicksburg campaign In early 1863, Union naval commander David Dixon Porter lost a new ironclad, after it ran aground on the Mississippi River near Vicksburg, Mississippi and was captured by Confederate forces. As the Confederates attempted to repair and refloat the damaged ship so they could use it against Porter's fleet, Porter executed a deception to thwart their effort. His men constructed a giant dummy ironclad from barges, barrels, and other materials that were on hand. Made to resemble a new, real ironclad, , the dummy was painted black to give it a sinister appearance and flew the Jolly Roger pirate flag. Porter's sailors floated the dummy, christened Black Terror, downstream at night, and it appeared impervious to Confederate shore battery fire. Exaggerated rumors about the seemingly indestructible super ship quickly spread to Vicksburg and reached salvage crews working on Indianola. In a panic, they halted their efforts, blew up Indianola, and abandoned the wreckage. When Black Terror ran aground and was inspected by Confederates, local newspapers roundly criticized military and naval commanders for being unable to tell the difference between a real warship and a fake. =Second Boer War= Long Tom artillery position deployed during the Second Boer War During the Second Boer War, British commander Robert Baden-Powell made extensive use of deception during his October 1899 to May 1900 defense of Mafeking. After he occupied the town with a force of 1,500, Baden-Powell faced 8,000 Boers who intended to begin a siege. As the Boers advanced, Baden-Powell wrote a letter to a friend in Transvaal whom he knew had died, which contained news of the imminent approach of more British troops. Baden-Powell intended for the letter to be intercepted and when it fell into Boer hands, they believed it was real. As a result they diverted 1,200 troops to guard the approaches against Baden-Powell's fictional reinforcements. Baden-Powell's troops also set up fake defensive works at a distance from the town itself, including one marked as his command post, which further diverted Boer attention. In addition, he had local residents execute deceptive tactics, including carrying boxes of sand labeled \\"mines\\" in places where they could be observed. Word of these supposed mines reached the Boers, and when they soon afterwards observed supposed minefields appear around the edge of the town, they assumed the danger was real. These deceptive measures held off a Boer attack, which allowed Baden-Powell time to improve Mafeking's defences. As a result of his effort, the British were able to hold out until reinforcements arrived and lifted the siege. =World War I= Gallipoli campaign During World War I, deception shifted from the tactical level to the strategic as modernized warfare and advances in technology increased the size and complexity of battlefield organizations. Several methods of deception were used by the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (Anzac) during its withdrawal from Gallipoli in Turkey, which was completed on December 20, 1915. As early as mid-November, artillery and sniper activity went silent for periods of time, giving the impression that the Anzacs were preparing to remain in the defense with limited resupply of ammunition during the upcoming winter. To cover the removal of the last troops, \\"drip rifles\\" were prepared to fire about 20 minutes after they were set, with a water can leaking into a second can that was tied to a rifle trigger. When the second can was full, the unmanned rifle would fire. The sporadic firing created by this ruse convinced the Turks that the Anzac troops were still manning their defenses. In addition, Anzac troops used dummy artillery and mannequins to further enhance the impression that troops remained in their positions. As a result of these deceptive measures, both the main body of Anzac troops and the rear guards retreated unmolested. Given the failure of the Gallipoli effort from the Anzac perspective, the evacuation was considered the most successful part of the entire campaign. Western front World War I Australian troops carrying a dummy Mark IV tank that was intended to deceive German forces during the following day's assault on part of the Hindenburg Line (September 1918) In March 1917, leaders of the German Army on the Western Front decided to withdraw from their positions in France to the Hindenburg Line, a 90-mile long defensive position that ran from Arras to Laffaux. With Germany unable to conduct an offensive because of personnel losses earlier in the war, commanders intended for unrestricted submarine warfare and strategic bombing to weaken the British and French, giving the German army time to recuperate. In addition, the move to the Hindenburg Line supported the plan of commanders Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff to shift the German focus to Russia and the Eastern Front. The withdrawal to the new defensive line would shorten Germany's front by 25 miles, enabling 13 divisions to be employed against the Russians. Under the plan code named Operation Alberich, the Germans abandoned their old positions in a staged series that began in late February. The majority of their movement occurred between March 16th and 21st, and the full German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line was completed on April 5. The German withdrawal included numerous efforts to deceive the Allies, among them night movements and skeleton crews who remained behind to provide screening fire from machine guns, rifles, and mortars. The deception activities proved generally successful, and Germany completed its withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line largely unmolested. In August 1918, the Allies intended to launch two offensives, one led by British commander Douglas Haig near Amiens, and the other by American John J. Pershing near Saint-Mihiel. Prior to the Battle of Amiens, Haig's subordinate Henry Rawlinson, commander of the British Fourth Army, employed several deceptive tactics, including periods of radio silence by units involved in the coming attack and false radio traffic from other parts of the British lines. In addition, Rawlinson delayed troop movement for as long as possible prior to the start of the attack to prevent German observers from obtaining data on his disposition of forces, and moved troops and materiel almost entirely at night. The British offensive was immediately successful because they had maintained the element of surprise. British troops and tanks advanced eight miles, captured 400 artillery pieces, and inflicted 27,000 casualties, including 12,000 prisoners. In an effort to gain an advantage near Saint-Mihiel, U.S. planners including Arthur L. Conger attempted to deceive the Germans into believing the American attack would come at Belfort, 180 miles to the south. False orders left where spies or informants could find them and staff officer reconnaissance activity created the appearance that the U.S. intended to conduct operations in and around Belfort. Pershing gained surprise at Saint-Mihiel and his offensive was successful. In 1926, Conger discovered from a former German officer that while the Belfort Ruse had not been completely successful, it had aided Pershing. Concerned that an Allied attack in the Belfort area was at least a possibility, many German units that could have reinforced German lines in the Saint-Mihiel area delayed movement from their rear area positions near Saint- Mihiel until it was too late. As a result of the success of Pershing's offensive, they did not have time to execute their withdrawal plans, and either abandoned their weapons and fled or were taken as prisoners. Eastern front At a war council held with senior commanders and the czar in April 1916, Russian General Aleksei Brusilov presented a plan to the Stavka (the Russian high command), proposing a massive offensive by his Southwestern Front against the Austro-Hungarian forces in Galicia. Brusilov's plan aimed to take some of the pressure off French and British armies in France and the Italian Army along the Isonzo Front and if possible to knock Austria-Hungary out of the war. As the Austrian army was heavily engaged in Italy, the Russian army enjoyed a significant numerical advantage in the Galician sector. Brusilov's plan was approved, and he massed 40 infantry divisions and 15 cavalry divisions in preparation for the Brusilov Offensive. Deception efforts included false radio traffic, false orders sent by messengers who were intended be captured, and equipment displays including dummy artillery to mislead Austria-Hungary as to the location of his units. Beginning in June 1916, Brusilov's surprise offensive caused Germany to halt its Western front attack on Verdun and transfer considerable forces to the Eastern front. It also effectively knocked Austria-Hungary out of the war, depriving Germany of its most important ally. Palestine In October 1917, Edmund Allenby, commander of Britain's Egyptian Expeditionary Force, planned to attack the Ottomans in southern Palestine. Rather than repeat previous frontal assaults at Gaza, which had been unsuccessful, he planned a flanking attack at Beersheba. As part of the larger deception effort to convince the Ottomans that Gaza was his objective, an officer under Allenby's command executed a deceptive tactic now known as the Haversack Ruse. In this effort, usually attributed to Richard Meinertzhagen, the officer intentionally dropped a knapsack which contained false plans for an attack on Gaza, which the Ottomans recovered. As a result of the Haversack Ruse and other deceptive measures, the British surprised the Ottomans and achieved victory at the October 31, 1917 Battle of Beersheba. Allenby again resorted to deception as he prepared to attack the Ottomans again at Tel Megiddo in September 1918.Bruce 2002 p. 205Powles 1922 pp. 234‚Äì5 In preparation for the battle, British forces concealed the movement of three cavalry and several infantry divisions from the eastern end of the front line, the Jordan Valley, to the western end on the Mediterranean Sea.Powles 1922 pp. 234‚Äì5 The single mounted division that remained in the east, reinforced with infantry, maintained the illusion that Jordan Valley remained fully garrisoned.Powles 1922 pp. 234‚Äì5 Deceptive measures included marching infantry into the valley during the day when they could be observed by the Ottomans, transporting them out by truck at night, then marching them back the next day.Powles 1922 pp. 234‚Äì5 The tents of the departed units were left standing, and dummy horses, mules, and soldiers made from canvas and straw were displayed throughout the encampment.Powles 1922 pp. 234‚Äì5 In addition, mules dragged branches up and down the valley to generate thick clouds of dust, giving the impression of more animals and men on hand than there actually were.Hamilton 1996 p. 135‚Äì6Mitchell 1978 pp. 160‚Äì1 Though the deceptions did not induce Otto Liman von Sanders, the commander of the Ottoman Army, to concentrate his forces on the eastern flank, as Allenby hoped, the Ottomans could not be certain of his intentions, so they could not concentrate their forces.Powles 1922 pp. 234‚Äì5 With the Ottomans spread throughout their line, Allenby's forces had a numerical advantage at the 19 to 25 September Battle of Megiddo (1918), and attained victory over the Ottomans.Powles 1922 pp. 234‚Äì5 At sea Britain's Royal Navy made extensive use of Q-ships to combat German submarines. Camouflaged to look like a civilian sailing vessel or decrepit tramp steamer, the Q-ships were decoys that carried concealed heavy guns. The function of the Q-ships was to appear to be an undefended target. If successful, German submarines would be lured to the surface to sink or destroy the ship by using deck guns, enabling the submarine to conserve its limited supply of torpedoes for use against warships. If a German U-boat surfaced, the Q-ship would immediately display the Royal Navy's White Ensign flag in compliance with international law, then deploy its guns against the submarine. In 150 engagements, British Q-ships destroyed 14 U-boats and damaged 60. 27 of the 200 Q-ships the British employed were lost to German attacks. =World War II= Eastern Front Before Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, the German High Command explained away the creation of a massive force arrayed to invade the Soviet Union by informing Soviet leaders including Joseph Stalin that it was training in preparation for an invasion of the United Kingdom. The deception worked, and Stalin continued to ignore German preparations until after the invasion of the Soviet Union had actually commenced. When the Allies on the Western Front planned the Normandy invasion for June 1944, the Soviet Union simultaneously planned for a major Eastern front offensive against German forces. Called Operation Bagration, this Soviet attack was designed to catch the Germans unprepared in Belorussia, at the center of their lines. To gain and maintain the element of surprise for Bagration, the Soviets executed a successful deception effort. The overall intent was to make German commanders believe the Soviets would only defend in the center of the front (Belorussia), while launching a major offensive to the south in Ukraine and Crimea and a feint to the north in Finland. Soviet military leaders successfully masked preparations for action in Belorussia and limited German reconnaissance in the center of the front while drawing German attention to deceptive activities in the north and south. Germany was caught off-guard at the start of the Bagration offensive on June 23, and the Soviets quickly pushed retreating German forces from the Soviet Union all the way to Poland. Western Front =Africa= From early 1941, Dudley Clarke commanded the 'A' Force, based in Cairo, Egypt, which developed much of the war's Allied deception strategy. In an initial deception failure from which Clarke derived an important lesson he put to use in the future, the British intended to retake British Somaliland by an advance from Sudan into Eritrea. Operation Camilla was intended to deceive the Italians occupying British Somaliland into thinking the British intended to retake British Somaliland by an amphibious assault from Aden. Instead of moving their troops to meet the potential amphibious landing, the Italians withdrew into Eritrea. As a result, they possessed greater strength at the British objective when the genuine British attack occurred. Clarke's lesson was to focus deception not on what the enemy should think is happening but what the deception planner wants the enemy to do as a result. =North Africa= Deception played an important part in the war in North Africa. In 1941, a British Army unit led by magician and illusionist Jasper Maskelyne prevented the destruction of Alexandria, Egypt by using lights to recreate the nighttime image of the city, while blacking out the actual city lights. Coupled with explosives that simulated German bombs landing on the city, Maskelyne's illusion caused German planes to release their ordnance on the vacant desert site he had prepared rather than on the city. Maskelyne was subsequently tasked with preventing the Germans from attacking the Suez Canal, a key asset in the Allied supply chain. Maskalyne responded by creating a system of swirling searchlights which cast a spray of strobe light over more than 100 miles of the sky above Egypt. German pilots were unable to see the canal, and so were unable to destroy it. As part of the deception surrounding Operation Crusader during the Siege of Tobruk, camouflage artist Steven Sykes built a dummy railhead near Misheifa in Egypt.Stroud, 2012. Pages 123‚Äì133. The intent, which succeeded, was to divert German aerial attacks from the real railhead and deceive the Germans into believing that the British attack would not begin until the dummy was completed.Stroud, 2012. Pages 123‚Äì133. Before the Second Battle of El Alamein, camouflage unit commander Geoffrey Barkas led Operation Sentinel and Operation Bertram, which used dummy equipment and other deceptive measures to deceive German commander Erwin Rommel about Allied strength and the timing and location of the Allied attack.Stroud, 2012. Pages 183‚Äì208. In Operation Sly Bob, Maskalyne's unit attempted to create a dummy submarine that would draw the attention of German reconnaissance aircraft along the German and Italian Italy-to-Tripoli supply line, enabling British ships to gain the element of surprise when attacking Axis shipping. By using old railroad sleeper cars, a wooden frame, nailed and welded beams, and metal tubing, Maskalyne's unit succeeded in creating a prototype that British ship commanders unaware of the deception plan nearly sank when they observed it near the Suez Canal. The difficulty in creating a viable dummy rendered the project impractical, and Sly Bob was abandoned before it was fully implemented. Based on the experience with Sly Bob, the British attempted to portray an aging cruiser as a battleship that would pose a threat to German shipping. When the effort proved unsuccessful because the dummy equipment and fixtures added to the cruiser were unrealistic, Maskalyne's team used the partially-dummied cruiser as \\"sucker bait\\". With sucker bait, a magician uses an audience's powers of observation against it by allowing members to falsely believe they see through a trick. By appearing to attempt to camouflage the cruiser-turned-dummy battleship, which Maskalyne christened HMS Houdin after magician Jean-Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin, but allowing German observers to see through the camouflage, Maskalyne's team enabled the Germans to conclude on their own that the British were attempting to hide a battleship. Allowing the Germans to believe they had penetrated the camouflage and detected the battleship created in the minds of German military leadership the same risk to German shipping a real battleship would have posed. =Normandy= Before the June 1944 D-Day invasion of Normandy, the Allies launched a deception codenamed Operation Bodyguard. As part of Bodyguard, the Operation Quicksilver deception portrayed First United States Army Group (FUSAG), a skeleton headquarters commanded by Omar Bradley, as an army group commanded by George Patton. In Operation Fortitude South, another component of Bodyguard, the Germans were persuaded that FUSAG would invade France at Pas-de-Calais in the fall of 1944. British and American troops used dummy equipment, false radio traffic and double agents to deceive German intelligence on the location and timing of the invasion. The Germans awaited the Calais landing for many weeks after the real landings in Normandy, leaving several divisions that could have helped delay or defeat the Normandy invasion near Calais. By the time the Germans realized the Normandy landings were the actual offensive, Allied units were so well established in Normandy that they could not be dislodged. Pacific theater Japan continued diplomatic engagement with the U.S. on several issues of concern throughout late November and into early December 1941 even though attacking ships had sailed from their base in the remote Kuril Islands. The surprise December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor took place several hours before Japan presented a formal declaration of hostilities and officially broke diplomatic ties. Japan also made extensive use of decoys and other deceptive displays throughout the war, which took on increased importance as the tide of the war went against it in 1944 and 1945. During the Battle of Iwo Jima in February and March 1945, Japanese deception included dummy tanks sculpted out of the island's soft volcanic rock. At the Japanese- held airfield in Tianhe District, China, the Japanese painted on the ground the image of a B-29 Bomber that appeared to be on fire. Their intent was for the painted image to appear real to high-flying aircraft, which would lower their altitude in order to investigate, thus making them targets for Japanese anti-aircraft fire. In addition, the Japanese made extensive use of bamboo- framed dummy aircraft to project airpower and protect their remaining aircraft, straw dummy soldiers and wood weapons that made defensive works appear to be manned, and wood dummy tanks to make infantry soldiers appear to have more combat power than they actually possessed. The Allies planned an invasion of Japan to take place after the end of fighting in Europe. This plan, codenamed Operation Downfall, had several components, including the Operation Olympic invasion of the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. The deception created to enable Olympic to succeed, Operation Pastel, would have included false attacks against Japanese held-ports in China, as well as Japanese positions on the island of Formosa. The end of the war following the U.S. atomic bomb attacks on Japan ended the need for a ground invasion or a deception plan, so Pastel was never implemented. =Korean War= In the summer of 1950, the Korean People's Army (KPA) of North Korea attacked South Korea. 140,000 South Korean and allied soldiers were nearly defeated. In August and September 1950, South Korea and its allies waged the Battle of Pusan Perimeter against the KPA and succeeded in establishing a defensive line that prevented the KPA from destroying them. To enable the counterattack that started with an amphibious landing at Inchon (codenamed Operation Chromite), United Nations (U.N.) forces staged an elaborate deception that made it appear the landing would take place at Gunsan, 105 miles away from the actual landing site at Inchon and closer to the Pusan Perimeter. On September 5, the U.S. Air Force began attacks on roads and bridges to isolate Gunsan. This was followed by a naval bombardment, which was followed by heavy bombing of military installations in and near the town. These tactics were typical pre-invasion steps, and were intended to cause North Korea to believe Gunsan was the planned U.N. invasion site. In addition to the aerial and naval bombardment, United States Marine Corps officers briefed their units on the supposed Gunsan landing within earshot of many Koreans, assuming that the information would make its way to KPA leaders through rumors or spies. On the night of 12-13 September, the British Royal Navy landed U.S. Army special operations troops and Royal Marines commandos at Gunsan, making sure that enemy forces noticed their supposed reconnaissance of the area. U.N. forces also conducted rehearsals on the coast of South Korea at several sites with conditions were similar to Inchon. These drills enabled U.N. forces to perfect the timing and actions of the planned Inchon landing while simultaneously confusing the North Koreans as to the actual landing site. On September 15, United Nations forces under Douglas MacArthur surprised the KPA with the Inchon landing. In the ensuing Battle of Inchon, the U.N. ended a string of victories by North Korea. The KPA collapsed within a month, and 135,000 KPA troops were taken prisoner. =Cuban Missile Crisis= During the period leading up to the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, Cuba and the Soviet Union employed several deceptive measures to hide their activities.Hansen (2002), pg. 50.Gribkov and Smith (1994), p. 24. These included the codename for the plan to deploy missiles in Cuba; Anadyr, a Russian town, is associated with the sparsely-populated and inaccessible area of Northeastern Russia and did not suggest an operation in the Caribbean.Hansen (2002), pg. 50.Gribkov and Smith (1994), p. 24. Soviet soldiers constructed false superstructures to hide the defenses of the ships transporting missiles and launching equipment to Cuba, and placed agricultural equipment and other non-military machinery on deck where it could be seen.Hansen (2002), pg. 52‚Äì53. Upon arrival, the ships unloaded at eleven different Cuban ports to deceive American surveillance efforts.Hansen (2002), pg. 53. At the same time, Soviet and Cuban news media reported on the supposedly massive agricultural assistance the Soviets were providing Cuba, which provided a plausible explanation for the activity and equipment that could be observed.Ibid.Gribkov and Smith (1994), pg. 38‚Äì40. The Soviet deception proved highly effective and the missiles were discovered only after they were already operational.Gribkov and Smith (1994), pg. 40. = Vietnam War = Operation Bolo Both North Vietnam and the forces of South Vietnam and the United States made use of deception during the Vietnam War. In 1967's Operation Bolo, a United States Air Force unit led by Robin Olds successfully countered the threat posed by Soviet MiG-21 fighter planes operating in North Vietnam. During bombing missions, unescorted U.S. Republic F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bombers would often be attacked by MiG-21s. Heavily laden with ordnance, the F-105s were no match for the faster MiGs. On occasions when the F-105s were escorted by F-4 Phantom II fighter planes, the MiGs would refuse to engage. In addition, the rules of engagement on the U.S. side prevented attacking the MiGs when they were on the ground. This measure was intended to keep the Soviet Union from becoming further engaged in the conflict by preventing casualties to the Soviet mechanics and technical advisors who were assisting North Vietnam. To counter the MiG threat, Olds' 8th Fighter Wing prepared its F-4s to display the electronic and radar signatures of F-105s. To create this effect, the 8th Fighter Wing outfitted F-4s with QRC-160 jamming pods, a device used only by F-105s. When they flew the mission, Olds and his fellow pilots assumed the route, elevation, speed, and formation of an F-105 flight. They also staggered the takeoff and arrival times of the F-4s so they could prevent the MiGs from landing once they were airborne. The Bolo deception was executed successfully. The North Vietnamese believed they faced an F-105 flight and dispatched their MiGs. The 8th Fighter Wing destroyed seven MiGs in a matter of minutes, while Olds' fighters sustained no losses. The destruction of half their MiGs and uncertainty about whether future flights observed on radar and electronic sensors were unescorted F-105s or F-4s pretending to be F-105s caused North Vietnam to ground its MiGs. The MiGs failed in their mission of preventing U.S. Operation Rolling Thunder bombing runs over North Vietnam. Tet Offensive In 1967, the government and military of North Vietnam began planning for an offensive that would begin in early 1968. The intent within the war's area of operations was to spark an uprising by the Viet Cong and others in South Vietnam who were sympathetic to the government in the north. In a wider sense, North Vietnam hoped the offensive would cause a withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Vietnam by undermining U.S. public confidence in the war. North Vietnam implemented several deceptive measures to mask preparations for the offensive. In October, the North Vietnamese government announced that it would observe Hanoi a seven-day holiday truce from January 27 to February 3, 1968, several days longer than previous Tet truces had lasted. The U.S. and South Vietnam presumed that the coming offensive, of which they had received some intelligence, would take place before or after the truce. When the attacks had not commenced before the holiday, South Vietnamese and U.S. leaders assumed it would come after the holiday. As a result, they allowed many soldiers to take holiday leave and relaxed the usual security measures. As an additional deceptive measure, while intending to attack South Vietnam's major cities and military installations, the North Vietnamese continued attacks along the border between the two countries during late 1967. These diversionary assaults served to draw U.S. attention to the border and draw U.S. forces away from the actual objectives -- the heavily populated South Vietnamese coastal lowlands and cities. When the offensive commenced, South Vietnam and the U.S. were surprised by the coordinated attacks. Over several days, the U.S. and South Vietnam regrouped and repulsed the North Vietnamese assaults. In the immediate aftermath, North Vietnam failed to attain the objective of creating an uprising in South Vietnam. In the longer term, the offensive did aid in swaying U.S. public opinion against the war, which led to a decreased U.S. presence in Vietnam and eventual withdrawal. = Cherbourg Project= In 1969, France abruptly declared an arms embargo against countries in the Middle East, chiefly aimed at Israel, and cancelled a contract to build patrol boats for Israel's navy. France also refused to release the last five boats built under the contract even though Israel had already paid for them. In response, the Israel Defense Forces mounted an elaborate scheme involving the purchase of the boats by a civilian company for non-military purposes. When they became concerned that the dummy transaction would be exposed, Israel decided to secretly take possession of the boats. The Israeli navy dispatched crews disguised as civilians, who gradually arrived at the French Atlantic seaport of Cherbourg. Once the crews assembled, they secretly sailed the five boats out of the harbor on the night of Christmas Eve 1969. Though they encountered a winter storm, the boats reached the Mediterranean Sea and safely completed the voyage to Israel. The plan to take possession of the boats, which the Israelis called \\"Operation Noa\\" but came to be known as the Cherbourg Project, was assisted by sympathetic Cherbourg shipyard and boat building company employees, but the French government was kept totally unaware until the boats had left port. =Yom Kippur War= In the period before the 1973 Yom Kippur War between Israel and the joint forces of Egypt and Syria, Egypt executed annual maneuvers near the Sinai Peninsula, Tahrir 41, which conditioned Israel to Egyptian troop activity in the area. In addition, several months before the start of the war, Egypt created the false impression of an imminent attack, which caused Israel to announce an emergency military reserve call up. When the war started, Israel believed the initial Egyptian troop movements were another iteration of the exercises the Egyptians had previously undertaken. In addition, because an emergency call up was costly and disruptive, the Israeli government was reluctant to conduct another one until it was sure an attack was underway. As a result of the deception, Egypt had surprise on its side when it attacked. =Operation Entebbe Rescue Mission= After the hijacking of an Air France plane in late June 1976, the perpetrators had the aircraft diverted to Entebbe Airport in Uganda, where they threatened to kill all the Jewish and Israeli passengers if their demands were not met. The Israeli government pursued diplomatic efforts to free the hostages while the Israeli Defense Forces planned a rescue mission in secrecy. When the raid was launched, IDF commandos secretly landed at an old unused area of the airport, intending to drive in decoy vehicles resembling Ugandan president Idi Amin's motorcade to the location where the passengers were being held hostage. By making themselves appear to be Amin and his security detail, the Israelis intended to gain the element of surprise on Ugandan guards at the terminal where the hostages were held. The ruse was only partly successful because Amin had recently changed limousines, and his new one was white, while the one the Israelis were using was black. The Ugandan guards realized the trick, which led to a gunfight that cost the Israeli commandos the element of surprise, but the raid ended with the successful rescue of the hostages. =Falklands War= The Falklands War took place between April and June 1982. During the period prior to the war, Argentina's military leaders, who were subordinate to general and president Leopoldo Galtieri, used the December 1981 change of command ceremony for Argentina's new chief of naval operations as cover to begin secretly planning for an invasion of the Falkland Islands. In April 1982, the forces of Argentina carried out the Invasion of South Georgia, an island possession of the United Kingdom. In mid-March, Argentina had used deception to successfully position an advance guard on South Georgia. An Argentinian company received a contract to dismantle a British whaling station for scrap. When the contractor's ship arrived, it contained members of an Argentinian Navy special forces unit who were disguised as scientists. When the British prepared to conduct a landing in response to Argentina's invasion, Argentina anticipated an assault at Port Stanley, the capital and site of the largest airport on the islands. The British gained the element of surprise by launching a feint at Stanley while conducting its main assault at San Carlos, on the opposite side of East Falkland. The British then marched overland to Port Stanley, where they launched a land-based attack on the Argentine defenses surrounding the city. The Argentinians were caught off-guard and were soon compelled to surrender. =Operation Just Cause= When the leader of Panama, Manuel Noriega realized he was being surveilled by the U.S. military prior to the United States invasion of Panama in December 1989, Noriega resorted to several deceptive measures to mask his movements and locations. These included Look-alike doubles, decoy vehicles and aircraft, false convoys, frequent changes of clothes, recordings of his voice played at locations where he was not present, and frequent changes of his actual location. On the U.S. side, deception included troop movements in and around U.S. bases in Panama made to look like routine training missions, a logistics buildup disguised as routine activity, and large-scale exercises in the United States that desensitized Panamanian leaders as to U.S. capabilities and intent. While Noriega and his subordinates knew the United States had the capacity to act, they were misled by their perceptions of U.S. activity and misreading of U.S intent into believing that the U.S. would not attack. As a result, when the attack occurred, the U.S. had the element of surprise, which helped it gain a quick victory. =Operation Desert Storm= During the period prior to the 1990-1991 Gulf War, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein positioned 100,000 troops near Iraq's border with Kuwait. To mask his true intention of invading Kuwait, during the summer of 1990, Saddam told ambassadors to Iraq, the leaders of other countries, and members of the international news media that his troops were on a training mission or were near the border merely as a tactic to extract concessions from Kuwait during diplomatic negotiations. On August 2, Iraq's invasion commenced; the small Kuwaiti military was quickly overwhelmed, and Iraq occupied Kuwait. After invading Kuwait, the creation of an anti-Iraq coalition and its movement of troops and materiel into Saudi Arabia caused Saddam to anticipate a Coalition ground assault from Saudi Arabia north into Kuwait and an amphibious landing on Kuwait's Persian Gulf coast. Prior to the start of the Coalition offensive in February 1991, its ground forces successfully moved multiple divisions west to the largely undefended border between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. When the attack commenced, the Coalition conducted a feint directly into Kuwait while the main effort -- the \\"Left Hook\\" enabled by concealing the move of units to the west -- attacked into Iraq and cut off Iraqi forces in Kuwait. After advancing into Iraq, Coalition forces turned right and attacked Iraqi forces in Kuwait from the rear. Facing overwhelming Coalition combat power in Kuwait and unable to retreat to Iraq, the Iraqi military in Kuwait quickly surrendered. In fiction Fictional examples of military deception include the 1966 Star Trek episode \\"The Corbomite Maneuver\\". When Enterprise is held by the tractor beam of an alien ship, its commander announces his intention to destroy Enterprise and its crew for the hostile act of trespassing into the alien's territory. Captain James T. Kirk informs the alien commander, Balok, that Enterprise is on a peaceful mission and trespassed accidentally. Balok does not accept Kirk's explanation, and still intends to destroy Enterprise. Kirk responds with a deceptive bluff, claiming that Enterprise is outfitted with a secret doomsday device made of \\"Corbomite\\" the details of which are known only to the captain. Destruction of Enterprise will trigger the Corbomite device, resulting in destruction of both Enterprise and the alien ship. Balok replies that he was testing the Enterprise in order to discern whether Kirk's claims of peaceful intentions were true. Satisfied that Kirk is honest, Balok expresses a desire to learn more about humans and their culture. A scene from the 2000 film The Patriot depicts a Patriot militia leader, Benjamin Martin, employing deceptive decoys when negotiating for the release of several members of his command who have been taken prisoner. Martin offers to exchange eighteen British officers, whom he claims are held on a hillside near the British headquarters. The British commander, General Cornwallis views the hill with a spyglass, observes figures in British uniforms who appear to be prisoners, and agrees to the exchange. After Martin and his men leave, the officer dispatched by Cornwallis to recover the British prisoners discovers they are scarecrows in captured British uniforms. In the 2003 film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, Captain Jack Aubrey of HMS Surprise is pursued by the French privateer Acheron. When Acheron appears likely to catch Surprise, Aubrey orders construction of a raft with sails, which contains lanterns arranged in the same pattern as those visible on the stern of Surprise. After night falls, a member of Aubrey's crew lights the raft's lanterns while another crewman douses the lanterns on Surprise. After recovering the crewman from the raft, Aubrey has the raft cut loose. The darkened Surprise then escapes on a new course while Acheron pursues the decoy, which appears to be Surprise as it continues on Surprise's original course. Opinions  Opinions vary among military strategists and authors as to the value of military deception. For example, the two books on warfare usually considered the most famous classics, Sun Tzu's The Art of War and Clausewitz's On War have diametrically opposed views. Sun Tzu emphasizes military deception and considers it the key to victory. Clausewitz argues that the fog of war prevents a commander from having a clear understanding of the operating environment, so creating some sort of false appearance, particularly on a large scale, is unlikely to be meaningful. Because of the cost and effort, Clausewitz argues that from a cost-benefit analysis, a large deception is an acceptable part of a course of action only under special circumstances.

They are generally posted at the entrance to a d≈çj≈ç or at the \\"front\\" of the dojo (shomen) and outline behaviour expected and disallowed. In some styles of martial arts they are recited at the end of a class. Shotokan Karate Generally credited to Gichin Funakoshi (but rumoured to have been created by Kanga Sakukawa, an 18th-century Okinawan karate proponent) the Shotokan Karate dojo kun serves as a set of five guiding principles, recited at the end of each training session in most styles, intended to frame the practice within an ethical context. The five rules are:Êó•Êú¨Á©∫ÊâãÊùæÊ∂õÈÄ£ÁõüÔºàJKSÔºâ ÈÅìÂ†¥Ë®ìËß£Ë™¨ :‰∏Ä„ÄÅ‰∫∫Ê†º ÂÆåÊàê„Å´ Âä™„ÇÅ„Çã „Åì„Å® ::hitotsu, jinkaku kansei ni tsutomeru koto ::jinkaku = personality, kansei = complete (perfect), ni = to, tsutomeru = endeavour :‰∏Ä„ÄÅË™†„ÅÆÈÅì„ÇíÂÆà„Çã„Åì„Å® ::hitotsu, makoto no michi wo mamoru koto ::makoto = truth, no = 's, michi = path, wo = with respect to that, mamoru = defend :‰∏Ä„ÄÅÂä™Âäõ„ÅÆÁ≤æÁ•û„ÇíÈ§ä„ÅÜ„Åì„Å® ::hitotsu, doryoku no seishin wo yashinau koto ::doryoku = effort, no = ‚Äôs, seishin = spirit, wo = with respect to that, yashinau = cultivate :‰∏Ä„ÄÅÁ§ºÂÑÄ„ÇíÈáç„Çì„Åö„Çã„Åì„Å® ::hitotsu, reigi wo omonzuru koto ::reigi = courtesy, wo = with respect to that, omonzuru = honour :‰∏Ä„ÄÅË°ÄÊ∞ó„ÅÆÂãá„ÇíÊàí„ÇÄ„Çã„Åì„Å® ::hitotsu, kekki no y≈´ wo imashimuru koto ::kekki = vigor (impetuousness), no = of, yu = courage, wo = with respect to that, imashimuru = refrain The word Hitotsu means \\"one\\" or \\"first\\" and is prepended to each rule to place it at the same level of importance as the others. The word koto which ends each rule means \\"thing\\" and is used as a conjunction between rules. Also, the Japanese no indicates possessiveness and is equivalent to the English 's e.g. doryoku no seishin = effort's spirit = the spirit of effort. wo (and wa) is used to indicate that the preceding element is the subject of the sentence e.g. X wo Y = with respect to X, Y. Finally, the word imashimuru seems archaic, however, it contains the radical Êàí that means admonition and is usually translated as refrain. =Interpretations= Varying translations and interpretations of the dojo kun exist. Each translation differs in the terms used and the interpretations vary regarding the philosophical depth, meaning, and intention. The population of English karate practitioners has pushed one form of the translation into being the most widely accepted outside Japan. Generally, the English translation states: * Each person must strive for the completion and perfection of one's character * Each person must be faithful and protect the way of truth * Each person must endeavor (fostering the spirit of effort) * Each person must respect others and the rules of etiquette * Each person must refrain from hot blooded behavior (guard against impetuous courage) A more terse translation is used by the ISKF, IKA and JKA: * Strive for completion of character (or Seek perfection of character) * Be Faithful * Endeavor * Respect others * Refrain from violent behavior An even more terse translation used in some clubs (often repeated towards the end of class by the students) * Character * Sincerity * Effort * Etiquette * Self-Control The dojo kun also appears in various other martial arts styles, with alterations according to the general precepts of that style. Goju Ryu Depending on your variant of Goju Ryu there are alternative Dojo Kun. The leading \\"Hitotsu\\" roughly means \\"number one\\", or \\"first\\" -- meaning that while they are generally used in the order listed, no one item is more important than another. Personal Communication from Teruo Chinen 1995 For the Okinawan Goju Ryu of Eiichi_Miyazato or Teruo Chinen, as published on the walls of their dojo, the Dojo Kun consists of eight rules and are (in English) as follows: * Hitotsu: Be humble and polite. * Hitotsu: Train considering your physical strength * Hitotsu: Practice earnestly with creativity. * Hitotsu: Be calm and swift. * Hitotsu: Take care of your health. * Hitotsu: Live a plain life. * Hitotsu: Do not be too proud or modest. * Hitotsu: Continue your training with patience. The translation above is from Teruo Chinen's dojo, the Miyazato version is slightly different. For other variants, including IOGKF, there are six rules and are (in English) as follows: * Hitotsu: Respect others. * Hitotsu: Be courageous. * Hitotsu: Train your mind and body. * Hitotsu: Practice daily and protect traditional karate- do. * Hitotsu: Strive to reach the essence of Goju Ryu. * Hitotsu: Never give up. Ryu-te The dojo kun Ryu-te are, in Japanese, the same as those used in Shotokan. The English translation used is as follows: * Strive for good moral character. * Keep an honest and sincere way. * Cultivate perseverance through a will for striving. * Develop a respectful attitude. * Restrain physical aggression through spiritual attainment. Bushido In Bushido the Dojo Kun consists of five rules and are (in English) as follows: * Loyalty is the essential duty of the soldier. * Courage is essential since the trait of the fighting man is his spirit to win. * Valor is a trait to be admired and encouraged in the modern warrior. * Faithfulness in keeping one's word. * Simplicity is a samurai virtue. Bud≈çkan Karate In Bud≈çkan Karate the Dojo Kun consists of four rules and are (in English) as follows: * Show courtesy, respect and honesty towards others. * Develop confidence through knowledge, honesty and strength. * Never use violence for personal gain. * Seek perfection of character. Shorinjiryu Kenkokan Karate Dojo Kun from the founder of Shorinjiryu Kenkokan Karate, Kaiso Dr. Kori Hisataka, are: * Maintain propriety, etiquette, dignity and grace * Gain self-understanding by tasting the true meaning of combat * Search for pure principle of being: truth, justice, beauty * Exercise a positive personality, that is to say: confidence, courage and determination * Always seek to develop the character further, aiming towards perfection and complete harmony with creation. Derivation The Shotokan Dojo Kun was derived from Gichin Funakoshi's The Twenty Guiding Principles of Karate, or niju kun, by JKA officials. It is used by many as a condensed form of Sensei Funakoshi's 20 precepts. (the below is someone's opinion. The obvious omission of anything relating to physical practice indicates it is not totally honest): In Shotokan or any other styles, the main purpose of learning karate is * to practice courtesy * be able to speak out (Increase self-confidence) * train focus to reach objectives * train guidance ability * train resistance against pressure * train speaking ability * train spirit of strive * train harmony characteristic * success or failure is not important (the below is also someone's opinion): The three most important spirits in dojo are: * say yes to obey * say thanks to appreciate * say sorry to increase introspection  References  External links * Calligraphy and sound * A Defense of the Dojo Kun * The Shotokan Way * The Dojo Kun of Bushido and Karate-Do Category:Japanese karate Category:Japanese martial arts terminology Category:Shotokan Category:Traditional karate ","title":"D≈çj≈ç kun"},{"id":"2601728","text":"The Battle of Chungju or the Battle of Tangeumdae was the last battle of the Chungju Campaign fought between the Koreans and Japanese during the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592. Chungju is located just south of the Han River and Seoul, Korea's capital. The defeat of the Korean forces at Chungju led directly to the capture of the capital of Hanseong by Japanese forces shortly thereafter. Background On receiving word of the Japanese invasion, and the fall of Busan and Dongnae to the Japanese, the Joseon court under King Seonjo took belated steps to appoint generals and to strengthen defenses on the approaches to the capital at Hanseong (present-day Seoul). Knowing that geography would dictate that the Japanese would follow one of three possible routes through the mountains to reach Hanseong, the central (and most direct) route was given the highest priority and its defense was assigned to Yi II and Sin Rip. Both generals had distinguished careers fighting the Jurchen to the north, but were hampered by lack of manpower, as the official military lists of soldiers were filled with missing men or untrained conscripts. Shin Rip was authorized to recruit the Naegeumwi Royal Guards into his forces and was personally given a sword by the king. Shin Rip assembled his forces at Chungju, consisting of approximately 8000 men. Many of these soldiers had fled from previous engagement with the Japanese at Dongnae, Daegu, and other locations to the south. His original plan was to fortify Choryong Pass, where the terrain could be used to good advantage against the numerically superior Japanese. However, the sudden appearance of General Yi II, minus his armor, horse, and army fresh from defeat at the Battle of Sangju cancelled these plans, as the Japanese army under Konishi Yukinaga was already approaching the pass. Shin Rip then decided to meet the Japanese out on the flat plains near Chungju with his back to the Han River. On one hand, the flat plains would give an advantage to his cavalry, but on the other hand, the Han River made retreat impossible. In the meantime, a second Japanese army of approximately 20,000 man under the command of Kato Kiyomasa had caught up with Konishi's army at Mungyong, just north of Sangju, where the eastern and central routes to Hanseong merged. Kato was outraged that his rival, Konoshi, had disobeyed orders to wait for his arrival at Busan, and had instead advanced far ahead. Kato demanded that his forces now be allowed to take the lead and to capture Hanseong, but Konishi refused. The two armies crossed the Choryong Pass together and approached Chungju, where Kato suddenly announced that he would set up camp, hoping that Konishi would rush headlong into battle with Shin Rip's cavalry, making him look foolish and incompetent. Battle As with previous battles at Busan and Dongnae, Konishi split his army into two. S≈ç Yoshitoshi and Konishi took the left flank and center with 15,000 men and the other commanders (Arima Harunobu, ≈åmura Yoshiaki, and Got≈ç Mototsugu) with 3700 men took the right, fanning out into a large arc. Shin Rip lined up his cavalry division along the river. This classic Chinese strategy is known as bae-soo-jin ( in Korean). However, as with previous engagements, the superior range and firepower of the arquebus-armed ashigaru soldiers inflicted heavy casualties on the crowded Korean forces while remaining out of range of the defender's bows and spears. Shin Rip did manage one cavalry charge, but found that various vegetation on the plain impeded his horses and that the Japanese forces also employed a considerable number of pikemen, who were able to break his charge before he could penetrate the Japanese lines. Shin Rip and a number of his commanders mounted on horses managed to escape the disaster; however, most of his men were cut down by the Japanese as they attempted to retreat. According to Japanese records, the Koreans lost 3000 men and several hundred were taken prisoner. As was customary, the heads of the slain were taken as trophies of war, but in this battle the number was too great, and it became the practice to take only the noses as \\"proof\\", needed when the soldiers applied for rewards. The Japanese took Chungju with minimal losses. Shin Rip later killed himself to atone for the defeat by drowning himself in a spring a short distance from Chungju. Aftermath After the battle, the forces of Kato Kiyomasa and Nabeshima Naoshige rejoined Konishi's army. Kato was even further upset over Konishi's success, and almost came to blows over who would lead the final attack on Hanseong. Konishi told Kato that there were two routes to the capital. The direct route to the northwest was the shortest, but crossed the Han River where the river was the widest. The other route was longer, to the north and then west, but crossed the Han River near its headwaters, where it was much narrower. He offered to draw lots over which route to take, but Kato demanded that he be given the direct route. Both generals set off the same night, not wishing for his rival to gain an advantage. A messenger brought the news of the defeat at Chungju to King Seonjo on 7 June, causing widespread panic. Many fled the city with whatever possessions they could carry, including most of the guards. Although many officials urged King Seonjo to remain in the capital, Prime Minister Yi Sanhae overcame opposition by citing precedents for the king relocating in time of crisis. King Seonjo appointed General Gim Myeong-won as Commander-in-Chief and Field Marshal, and ordered him to defend the capital. Then the king moved to Pyongyang, since the Japanese began to seize the capital. He later moved even further north to the border city of Uiju just before the fall of Pyongyang. While the king was absent from the capital, many people who had lost hope in the government plundered the palace and burned many public buildings. This resulted in even more damage than that perpetrated by the Japanese after they had captured the city. Japanese invasions of Korea 1592‚Äì1598 at Doosan Encyclopedia Japanese invasions of Korea 1592‚Äì1598 at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture On 8 June, the vanguard of Kato's army reached the Han River, finding that all boats on the south bank had been destroyed, either by the Koreans, or by Konishi's men sent ahead to impede his progress. On the north bank of the river, Gim Myeong-won deployed his 50 officers and 1000 men to oppose Kato's crossing. Undeterred by the lack of boats, Kato ordered his men to cut down trees and make rafts, effecting a crossing of the Han River near what is now the Yongsan District of Seoul on 11 June. Seeing that he was greatly outnumbered, and unnerved by the arquebuss fire from the Japanese troops, Gim fled his command disguised as a civilian, allowing Kato's army to cross unopposed. He reached the South Gate of the city on 12 June, only to find that Konishi's banner was already flying from its roof. Konishi's forces had raced ahead of Kato, and had entered the city through its East Gate hours earlier. Four days later, on 16 June, the army of Kuroda Nagamasa reached the city, together with the army of 10,000 men led by Ukita Hideie of Bizen Province. The remaining five armies of Toyotomi Hideyoshi's invasion force of 158,000 men had already arrived in the vicinity of Busan.

These chapters contain the story of a group of Nephites, led by Zeniff, who leave the land of Zarahemla and return to their former land, known as the land of Nephi, which was then occupied by the Lamanites, their traditional enemies. Although the attempt to establish themselves among the Lamanites is successful for a short time, the people of Zeniff are ultimately enslaved and forced to pay tribute to the Lamanite king. They are later rescued by an expedition from Zarahemla sent to discover their fate. The Record of Zeniff records the reigns of Zeniff, his son Noah and grandson Limhi. The timespan is approximately 75 years. Background According to the Book of Mormon, the prophet Lehi and his family left Jerusalem and travelled \\"in the wilderness\\" for a number of years before building a boat and sailing to \\"the promised land\\". The name of the land in which they first settled is not given (though perhaps it was called the land of Lehi). Following Lehi's death, his older sons, Laman and Lemuel, rebelled against their younger brother Nephi, who had been appointed by their father as their leader. Fearing for their safety, Nephi and his followers travelled \\"for many days\\" to a new land which they called Nephi (2 Ne. 5:7-8). Afterward, in the Book of Mormon, the descendants of Laman, Lemuel and their followers are known as Lamanites, while the descendants of Nephi and his followers are called Nephites. Centuries later, after many wars and contentions between the Nephites and the Lamanites, a new prophet, Mosiah, gathered as many Nephites as would follow and fled \\"into the wilderness\\", where they discovered the land of Zarahemla, inhabited by a people known as Mulekites (Omni 1:12-13). The Mulekites joined with the Nephites (the two peoples together now being called Nephites) and Mosiah was appointed their king. Zeniff About 200 B.C., according to Book of Mormon chronology, Zeniff led a group of people from Zarahemla to the land of Nephi so that they might \\"possess the land of their inheritance\\" (Omni 1:27). Rather than attempting to take the land from the Lamanites by force, Zeniff sought to establish peaceful relations by treaty. The Lamanite king, Laman, agreed to give them land previously occupied by his people but Zeniff later realized that the king intended to enrich himself by taking the goods the Nephites have produced. After a few years of peace, the Lamanites began raiding the Nephite settlements, finally leading to two great battles which end in victory for the Nephites. The Lamanites did not attack the Nephites again during the reign of Zeniff, but his people were forced to guard their lands and goods. After a reign of about forty years, Zeniff grew old and conferred the kingdom on his son, Noah. The first person account of the reign of Zeniff is contained in chapters 9 and 10 of the Book of Mosiah. Grant Hardy says: :Zeniff has a remarkable ability to see the good in others, for earlier record keepers [in the Book of Mormon] such as Enos and Jarom found nothing of value in Lamanite culture... Yet Zeniff, as a man of peace, argues that the Nephites should make a treaty with the Lamanites and regain the land of their inheritance through negotiation rather than conquestHardy, p 125 King Noah, Abinadi and Alma The account of King Noah's reign emphasizes his failure to obey God's commandments. Noah \\"did not walk in the ways of his father\\" (Mosiah 11:2), but lived a sinful, idle life surrounded by cronies, including a group of corrupt priests, all supported by heavy taxes on his people. A prophet, Abinadi, was sent to warn Noah to repent and to call his people to repentance. Abinadi prophesied the destruction of Noah and his people if they did not repent. One of the priests, Alma, believed Abinadi but was forced to flee when he tried to defend him. Noah refused to listen to Abinadi and had him put to death by fire. Alma began to preach Abinadi's message to the people of King Noah and attracted about 450 believers (Mosiah 18:35). When the movement was discovered by King Noah he sent his army to destroy Alma and his followers, but they escaped \\"into the wilderness\\". Noah continued his wicked practices, and, because he was more concerned with maintaining his lavish lifestyle than defending his people, he failed to maintain an adequate guard on his kingdom. When the Lamanites attacked Noah's people once again, his priests and many Nephite men fled, allowing the Lamanites to conquer those who remained. When the men who fled with Noah overcame their cowardice and resolve to return, Noah tried to prevent them. He was killed, though the wicked priests escaped. The account of King Noah is contained in Mosiah 11-19, including an extended discourse by Abinadi in Mosiah 13-16. Limhi Limhi, Noah's son, became a tributary monarch, subject to the king of the Lamanites. After unsuccessful attempts to drive the Lamanites off by force, Limhi and his people became resigned to their captivity and were effectively enslaved by the Lamanites. They were ultimately rescued by a group of Nephites from Zarahemla, led by Ammon. Ammon and his companions were searching for the people of Zeniff, whose fate was unknown to them. Limhi and Ammon knew that escape by force was impossible and so resorted to a stratagem. After preparing the people for flight, they tricked the Lamanite guards into drinking a tribute of strong wine and escaped while the guards were drunken. Ammon then led them back to Zarahemla. The account of King Limhi's reign and the rescue of his people is contained in Mosiah 20-22. Conclusion The return of Limhi's people to Zarahemla ends the Record of Zeniff. However, events set in motion by Zeniff and his people continue to play out for some time. The fate of the people led away by Alma at the time of Abinadi's prophesying is told in the next two chapters of the Book of Mosiah. (They are also captured by the Lamanites but miraculously escape and join the Nephites in Zarahemla, where Alma plays a significant role in the development of the church.) The wicked priests of King Noah join with the Lamanites and, because of their exceptional hatred for the Nephites, they rise to positions of authority and play a major part in future conflicts between the Lamanites and the Nephites.

It was usually said to be in Abkhazia, and was officially known as Hanyson or Hamson (or some variation; the name apparently comes from the Hamshen area of Turkey), or simply the Forest of Abkhazia. The Land of Darkness enjoyed popularity in fictional medieval travel literature such as the Alexander Romance and the Travels of Sir John Mandeville. According to Mandeville, no one ventures into Hanyson out of fear, but the people in the surrounding area know it to be populated, as they can hear human voices inside. The residents of Hanyson are the descendants of Persian Emperor Saures (Shapur II) and his men, who were trapped there forever by a miracle of God. Saures had been persecuting his Christian subjects in Abkhazia, and had cornered them on a plain. They prayed to God, and God responded by surrounding the king's armies in the thick, impenetrable darkness that still affected the land. In the Alexander Romance, Alexander the Great crosses the Land of Darkness in his search for the Water of Life. After passing through Russia and coming almost to the edge of the world, Alexander finds the darkened country and travels it with his servant Andreas (in the Persian version of the Romance, this servant is identified with Al-Khidr, the hero from the Qur'an). Alexander cannot find his way through the darkness, but his servant does. Andreas drinks of the Water of Life and becomes immortal. The Land of Darkness was also identified with the area around the northern Ural Mountains.Janet Martin, Treasure from the Land of Darkness: The Fur Trade and its Significance for Medieval Russia,pg:21,22, 1986 When Abu Hamid al-Gharnati visited Volga Bulgaria in 1135-36, he was told that the Land of Darkness was not far from Yugra(or Yura).

They are glossy dark green above and paler on the underside, with two white stomatal bands. The cones are long, green, maturing light to mid-brown 6‚Äì7 months after pollination. When fully open, their scales are positioned at a right angle or reflexed to the central axis.Gymnosperm Database: Tsuga caroliniana Flora of North America: Tsuga Caroliniana The hemlock woolly adelgid Adelges tsugae, an adelgid introduced to the United States from Asia in 1924, threatens Carolina hemlock, which is as susceptible as the related eastern hemlock. Carolina hemlock is used more often as an ornamental tree than for timber production, due to its overall rarity. In landscaping, it is similar in appearance to eastern hemlock, but the Carolina hemlock has a deep taproot, compared with the shallow, aggressive roots of eastern hemlock. This means shrubs and other plants can be grown more easily under Carolina hemlock.

Beecher was active in the American labor and civil rights movements. During the McCarthy era, Beecher lost his teaching job for refusing to sign a state loyalty oath. Following a 1967 decision of the California Supreme Court that disallowed such a loyalty oath, he was reinstated in 1977. Beecher's books include Report to the Stockholders, To Live and Die in Dixie, and In Egypt Land.  Biography  John Henry Newman Beecher was born in New York City on January 22, 1904, to Leonard and Isabel Beecher. He was a descendant of the New England literary and abolitionist Beechers that included Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of Uncle Tom's Cabin, Lyman Beecher, and Henry Ward Beecher. His father was a steel industry executive. In 1907, Beecher's father was transferred to Birmingham, Alabama, to work for the United States Steel Corporation and Beecher spent the rest of his childhood in the American South. Beecher's family intended their son to become an executive like his father. After graduating from public high school at age fourteen, Beecher went to work in the steel mills of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. The labor abuses he saw there caused him to become active in labor movement issues. He also wrote several of the radical activist poems he eventually became known for. He spent only a short time at the Virginia Military Institute before he found the school's hazing of new cadets a reason to leave. Beecher attended several colleges and earned his BA from the University of Alabama in 1924. He was severely injured while working on the construction of the Fairfield Sheet Mill near Birmingham in 1925. Beecher earned a master's degree in English at the University of Wisconsin in 1929 while teaching at Alexander Meiklejohn's experimental college there. He then pursued graduate studies in sociology at the University of North Carolina, where he worked on Howard Washington Odum's Southern Regions of the United States (1936). He published Report to the Stockholders in 1933, a nine-part poem about the unfair treatment of mill workers. From 1934‚Äì1941, he worked for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and other New Deal programs in the South and Southwest. His varied activities included managing resettlement camps for displaced farmers, both white and black. He published his first work of sociology in 1935, an article in the journal Social Forces about a biracial union in Notasulga, Alabama. He described his frustration with the government's programs in two collections of poems: Here I Stand (1940) and And I Will Be Heard (1941). During World War II, he volunteered and served as a commissioned officer of the interracial crew of the troop transport SS Booker T. Washington and wrote a book about his experiences, All Brave Sailors. Reviewing it in the New Republic, Ralph Ellison wrote that it provided \\"a heartwarming but somewhat sentimentalized picture\\" that excluded even the healthy amount of interracial conflict that could be expected. \\"Despite their high political consciousness,\\" he wrote, \\"for a mixed group of Americans a-sail on the rough seas of our race relations, Beecher's seamen encountered an embarrassment of fine weather.\\" He thought Beecher's portrait of his family background showed the promise of \\"a really important autobiography\\". After the war, he was commissioned to write a history of Minnesota's politicians and the farmer-labor movement in the 1930s. It was not published until 1980 when it appeared as Tomorrow is a Day. Beecher took a teaching position at San Francisco State College in 1948. In 1950, he refused to sign the loyalty oath required by California's Levering Act. He was fired from his teaching job for \\"gross unprofessional conduct\\" and blacklisted from teaching. He described the experience in an essay in The Nation: \\"California: There She Goes\\".John Beecher, \\"California: There She Goes,\\" The Nation, June 30, 1951 During the 1950s, Beecher worked as a rancher and printer. He produced privately printed editions and broadsides of his own poetry at his own Morning Star Press. He also taught at Arizona State University in the late 1950s. Beecher spent the 1960s primarily as a journalist writing about social injustice, and also as a teacher, while enjoying the renewed prominence of his poetry. As a writer and journalist, he contributed to publications such as The Nation, Ramparts, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the New York Times. In 1968, a recording of him reading several of his poems was released under the title \\"John Beecher's To Live and Die in Dixie\\". A New York Times reviewer commented: \\"John Beecher's complaints are specific: injustices against the Negro, against labor, against the newly arrived in this country. His work is hard to tell from prose, but it has a certain artlessness that is affecting in spite of the excessive simplicity of his lines.\\" In 1970, Studs Terkel included Beecher as one of his subjects in Hard Times: An Oral History of the Great Depression. In 1967, the California Supreme Court found the Levering Act unconstitutional. In 1977, Beecher's dismissal from his teaching post was overturned and he was reappointed. Beecher taught full-time at San Francisco State until August 1979. His classes included Sociology, Writing, Humanities, and American Literature.Los Angeles Times, The book Review. Sunday, August 26, 1979, including hand written notes by John Beecher Beecher married several times. He wed Virginia St. Clair Donovan in 1926. They had four children and later divorced. He was married twice briefly between 1946, which produced a son Tom, and 1952 and married his fourth wife, Barbara, in 1955. John Beecher died of lung disease on May 11, 1980, and was buried in Los Gatos Memorial Park in San Jose, California.

Located just east of present-day Fort Calhoun, Nebraska, the fort was erected in 1819 and abandoned in 1827. The site is now known as Fort Atkinson State Historical Park and is a National Historic Landmark. A replica fort was constructed by the state at the site during the 1980s‚Äì1990s. The post, which included soldiers, traders, trappers, and other frontier people, has been credited by the Nebraska State Legislature as the first town in Nebraska. Founded almost 30 years before the creation of the Nebraska Territory, Fort Atkinson had more than 1,000 residents. It included a brickyard, lime kiln, stone quarry, grist mill, saw mill, and cooper shop.(1912) Bulletin. Issues 2. Nebraska State Legislature. p. 7. Lewis and Clark The site that would become Fort Atkinson was the Council Bluff (not to be confused with Council Bluffs, Iowa, 20 miles to the south), which was the site of an 1804 council between the Lewis and Clark Expedition and members of the Oto and Missouria Native American tribes. William Clark recommended the high bluff overlooking the Missouri River to the United States government as a suitable location to build a fort. Council Bluff: frontier post Fifteen years later, in 1819, President James Monroe dispatched a military expedition (the Yellowstone Expedition, led by Colonel Henry Atkinson) to establish a series of forts along the Missouri. These forts were to support the American fur trade and counteract British influence on the northern plains. The 6th US Infantry and 1st Rifle Regiments made up the military portion of the expedition, which arrived at the Council Bluff site on September 19. Their establishment of Fort Atkinson made it the first major American fort west of the Missouri River. It was located near Fort Lisa and Cabanne's Trading Post, private fur trading establishments operated by major traders who were based in St. Louis, Missouri. The expedition stopped to build Cantonment Missouri, a winter camp along the river bottom below the bluffs. Abandoning plans to establish more forts upstream, the soldiers settled in for winter. The winter of 1819‚Äì20 was very harsh; a shortfall of government contractors left the garrison without sufficient supplies. The soldiers suffered widespread scurvy (due to poor nutrition and lack of vitamin C), which claimed the lives of over 200 of the 1,120 men that first winter. Estimates of the civilian deaths is possibly as high as double the military dead; no records were kept of their losses. In the spring of 1820, the Missouri River flooded Cantonment Missouri. The soldiers built a permanent camp atop Council Bluff, and renamed it Fort Atkinson. The site was designated on US Federal Government maps as \\"Fort Calhoun\\" in honor of the Secretary of War, John C. Calhoun, however the US Army named the actual encampment after its first commander. During the 1820s, soldiers took meteorological observations as research for the government. The garrison was involved in combat only in 1823. Members of the Arikara tribe attacked a trading party led by William H. Ashley along the Missouri River in present-day South Dakota. Soldiers from the fort retaliated by attacking the Arikara villages. Although no American soldiers died in the brief skirmish, seven soldiers drowned on the way upriver when their keelboat struck a log. They were counted as the first United States' casualties in the Indian Wars on the Great Plains. In 1827, the Army abandoned the fort at Council Bluff and reassigned its personnel to other locations, primarily Fort Leavenworth. Re- activation of Fort Atkinson When the Mormons established Cutler's Park in the North Omaha area in 1846, some of their food for the harsh winter was provided from old provisions they found at the fort. By the 1850s, when widespread European-American settlement began in the area, little remained of the fort. In the 1950s, Nebraska State Historical Society archeological crews determined the locations of buildings at the Fort Atkinson site. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission gained title to the site in 1963. During the 1980s and 1990s, it reconstructed the fort. Today, Fort Atkinson is a Nebraska state historical park, which includes a military museum. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Living history demonstrations take place on the first weekend of each month from May to October. In addition to people demonstrating craft work and the duties of the Indian agent, military re- enactors interpret the activities of the Sixth Regiment of United States Infantry and First Regiment of United States Riflemen.

The culture may be divided into early and late phases, before and after 4000 BC respectively. The site at Hemudu, 22 km northwest of Ningbo, was discovered in 1973. Hemudu sites were also discovered at Tianluoshan in Yuyao city, and on the islands of Zhoushan. Hemudu are said to have differed physically from inhabitants of the Yellow River sites to the north. Some authors propose that the Hemudu Culture was a source of the pre-Austronesian cultures. Material culture Some scholars assert that the Hemudu culture co-existed with the Majiabang culture as two separate and distinct cultures, with cultural transmissions between the two. Other scholars group Hemudu in with Majiabang subtraditions. Two major floods caused the nearby Yaojiang River to change its course and inundated the soil with salt, forcing the people of Hemudu to abandon its settlements. The Hemudu people lived in long, stilt houses. Communal longhouses were also common in Hemudu sites, much like the ones found in modern-day Borneo. The Hemudu culture was one of the earliest cultures to cultivate rice. Recent excavations at the Hemudu period site of Tianluoshan has demonstrated rice was undergoing evolutionary changes recognized as domestication.Fuller, Dorian Q, Ling Qin, Yunfei Zheng, Zhijun Zhao, Xugao Chen, Leo Aoi Hosoya, and Guo-ping Sun (2009) \\"The Domestication Process and Domestication Rate in Rice: Spikelet bases from the Lower Yangtze\\". Science 323: 1607‚Äì1610 Most of the artifacts discovered at Hemudu consist of animal bones, exemplified by hoes made of shoulder bones used for cultivating rice. The culture also produced lacquer wood. A red lacquer wood bowl at the Zhejiang Museum is dated to 4000-5000 BC. It is believed to be the earliest such object in the world.Red Lacquer Wood Bowl: The Origin of Lacquerware (2009) The remains of various plants, including water caltrop, Nelumbo nucifera, acorns, melon, wild kiwifruit, blackberries, peach, the foxnut or Gorgon euryale and bottle gourd, were found at Hemudu and Tianluoshan. The Hemudu people likely domesticated pigs but practiced extensive hunting of deer and some wild water buffalo. Fishing was also carried out on a large scale, with a particular focus on crucian carp.Nakajima T, Nakajima M, Mizuno T, Sun G-P, He S-P and Yamazaki T (2010) \\"On the pharyngeal tooth remains of crucian and common carp from the Neolithic Tianluoshan site, Zhejiang Province, China, with remarks on the relationship between freshwater fishing and rice cultivation in the Neolithic Age\\". International Journal of Osteoarchaeology . The practices of fishing and hunting are evidenced by the remains of bone harpoons and bows and arrowheads. Music instruments, such as bone whistles and wooden drums, were also found at Hemudu. Artifact design by Hemudu inhabitants bears many resemblances to those of Insular Southeast Asia. The culture produced a thick, porous pottery. This distinctive pottery was typically black and made with charcoal powder. Plant and geometric designs were commonly painted onto the pottery; the pottery was sometimes also cord-marked. The culture also produced carved jade ornaments, carved ivory artifacts and small clay figurines. Sociopolitical organization The early Hemudu period is considered the maternal clan phase. Descent is thought to have been matrilineal and the social status of children and women comparatively high. In the later periods, they gradually transitioned into patrilineal clans. During this period, the social status of men rose and descent was passed through the male line. Religion Hemudu's inhabitants worshiped a sun spirit as well as a fertility spirit. They also enacted shamanistic rituals to the sun and believed in bird totems. A belief in an afterlife and ghosts is thought to have been widespread as well. People were buried with their heads facing east or northeast and most had no burial objects. Infants were buried in urn-casket style burials, while children and adults received earth level burials. They did not have a definite communal burial ground, for the most part, but a clan communal burial ground has been found from the later period. Two groups in separate parts of this burial ground are thought to be two intermarrying clans. There were noticeably more burial goods in this communal burial ground. Environment Fossilized amoeboids and pollen suggests Hemudu culture emerged and developed in the middle of the Holocene Climatic Optimum. A study of a sea-level highstand in the Ningshao Plain from 7000 to 5000 BP shows that there may have been stabilized lower sea levels at this time, followed by frequent flooding from 5000 to 3900 BP. The climate was said to be tropical to subtropical with high temperatures and much precipitation throughout the year.

Retro-bolting can be contrasted with re-bolting, which is the replacement of existing bolts on a climb with new bolts. There are many ethical issues relating to retro-bolting which can divide climbers into two camps, those for and those against. Background New climbing routes are produced by a First Ascentionist (FA) scoping out an unclimbed line, deciding to climb a certain section of rock and ultimately climbing it. Typically this first person then gets to name the climb and give it a grading. The route is then generally recorded in a guidebook for posterity. The climb is defined by the style that this person did the climb in, that is, how much protection did they use, was it traditional, did they use bolts or was there a mix of both. Climbing ethics dictate that a climber should attempt to complete the climb in the same style as the FA, or better. This means that they should use the same type of protection without adding any extra bolts. Retro-bolting is the act of adding additional bolts to a climb that the first ascentionist never needed/added hence making the route either easier or less dangerous. Argument =For= Proponents of retro-bolting generally cite safety and enjoyment of climbs by all as their major motivations. The FA may have put up a climb that has few options for traditional protection, and did not add any bolts for extra protection. This means that a fall at certain points of the climb could result in a ground fall. These type of climbs will generally only be climbed by people confident in their abilities and mentally prepared for the challenge. This means the climb may get very little traffic. Climbs should be enjoyed by everyone, and just because a climber is not as proficient as the FA, does not mean that they should not enjoy the climb as well. If new bolts are added, more people will be able to enjoy the climb as it is safer. People that wish to do the climb in the original way can just not use the bolts. =Against= Opponents of retro-bolting cite the adventure aspect of climbing and respect for the FA as reasons for not going ahead. Climbing is an adventure sport that is inherently risky. A climber should understand and accept this risk. If the FA is exceptionally skilled and put up a climb that was both difficult and dangerous, then that is to be respected. The climb should not be \\"brought down to your level\\" by the addition of extra bolts which will ruin the adventure aspect of the climb for someone who is proficient enough to complete the climb in its original state. If a route is climbed very often then it can quickly become polished. This is where the rock becomes smooth as the friction of people shoes and hands wears it away. This can be seen in clear evidence on well travelled routes such as \\"Saul's Crack\\" (HVS 5a) on the Upper Tier of The Roaches, Peak District, UK. The retro bolting of a route makes it accessible to more climbers which will result in the loss of quality of the rock through polishing. The first ascent of a bolt-free climb will have caused no deliberate damage. For subsequent climbers to then deliberately drill that piece of rock; cliff or crag to placing expansion bolts, to bring the grade of the climb down to their level, is unacceptable. Outcomes The practise of retro-bolting remains controversial in many areas. In some areas it is more accepted. As bolts tends to get old and need to be replace anyway, the new bolter normally moves the bolts and bolts as it fit for a more modern style of bolting. The First Ascentionist has accepted some \\"moral rights\\" for their climb so it is might be reasonable for that person to allow retro-bolting of their climb. The FA may feel that at the time they ascended the climb, the conditions were right for a scary climb, but now they wish to open the line up to more people and let the route have more traffic. Some of the climbers in the For camp may feel that action is needed and bolts are added to the climb without consensus. This will generally result in the bolts being chopped (removed), but sometimes the bolts remain intact and the climb becomes accepted in its new form. This is generally rare.

The university was established by royal charter after approval from King Henry III in 1261. It was the third university in England, after Oxford and Cambridge, and the 22nd in Europe. After being advised by bishops and magnates that Northampton was a threat to Oxford, Henry III dissolved the university in 1265, and signed a Royal Decree that banned the establishment of a university in Northampton. In 2005 the decree was repealed by the Privy Council, allowing the then University College Northampton (founded in 1924) to gain university status and become the University of Northampton. History =Founding= Northampton was, in the 13th century, a far more important town than is evident today, so it is not particularly surprising that a university was established there. The town was also, briefly, the King's seat.Andrew, Martin: Northampton (The Francis Frith Collection), 2002. The University of Northampton was founded in the reign of King Richard I (the ‚ÄòLion-heart‚Äô) as a school. Richard patronised the institution and, according to at least one historian, between 1176 and 1193 the school at Northampton ‚Äòrivalled or even eclipsed the Oxford schools‚ÄôCobban, Alan B., The Medieval Universities: Their Development and Organization (Methuen, 1975) The school lost a powerful supporter with the death of King Richard. However, it still enjoyed the patronage of Simon de MontfortJ. R. Maddicott, Simon de Montfort (Cambridge University Press, 1996) through the reign of King John and his son Henry III. There were violent 'town and gown' confrontations in Cambridge in 1249, and again in 1260, when there was major rioting resulting in the execution of 16 townsmen and the severe punishment of many more. Following this, several scholars fled seeking sanctuary in Northampton. In 1261 Henry III was requested to give, and granted, permission for the settlement of a university in the town. =Abolition= The existence of the University was brief. Four years after it was established, during the siege of Northampton, the scholars resisted the entry of the King‚Äôs forces, which resulted in Henry III revoking the town‚Äôs licence to have a University.Alan B. Cobban, The Medieval English Universities: Oxford and Cambridge to c. 1500 (Scolar Press, 1988) Some sources suggest an alternative motive for the closure of the University. As one writer put itIt should have been Northampton.\\"... an interesting proclamation from Henry III suggests a more parochial and self-interested reason for the folding of the town‚Äôs 13th century university. On 1 February 1265, Henry wrote to the mayors and burgesses of Northampton: :\\"We acceded to their request [to establish a university in 1261] because we believed then that this would benefit your town and that advantage would accrue to us; but now we have learned on the testimony of men worthy of belief that, if the university remains at Northampton, no small damage would be incurred by our borough of Oxford, which is of ancient creation, has been confirmed by our ancestors, and is generally approved as a convenience to students. We should on no grounds be willing that this should happen, especially as all the bishops agree that for the honour of God, the advantage of the church of England and the well being of the students, the university should be removed from Northampton\\".F. M. Powicke, Ways of Medieval Life and Thought: essays and addresses. (New York: Biblo and Tannen, 1964). A university class, (1350s) This suggests that academic rivalry played a part in the King's decision as evidenced by the advice he received from professors at Oxford on the matter. =The modern University of Northampton= The university's name was revived in 2005 when the then University College Northampton, itself an amalgam of earlier institutions, was upgraded to full university status and renamed the University of Northampton. Other than the name and the location in the town, there is no link between the medieval university and the modern university.

As Bernardine Evaristo notes, \\"Lovelace is unusual among celebrated Caribbean writers in that he has always lived in Trinidad. Most writers leave to find support for their literary endeavours elsewhere and this, arguably, shapes the literature, especially after long periods of exile.

Marshall's favorite basketball player as a youth was Penny Hardaway.NBDL Interview: Rawle Marshall College career Marshall spent his college freshman season at Ball State University, but then moved to Oakland University for his final three collegiate seasons.

There is a continuing scholarly debate about whether the alleged fragment was real, or a musical hoax perpetrated by Giazotto, but there is no doubt about Giazotto's authorship of the remainder of the work. Provenance The composition is often referred to as \\"Albinoni's Adagio\\" or \\"Adagio in G minor by Albinoni, arranged by Giazotto\\". The ascription to Albinoni rests upon Giazotto's purported discovery of a manuscript fragment (consisting of a few opening measures of the melody line and basso continuo portion) from a slow second movement of an otherwise unknown Albinoni trio sonata. According to Giazotto, he obtained the document shortly after the end of World War II from the Saxon State Library in Dresden which had preserved most of its collection, though its buildings were destroyed in the bombing raids of February and March 1945 by the British and American Air Forces. Giazotto concluded that the manuscript fragment was a portion of a church sonata (sonata da chiesa, one of two standard forms of the trio sonata) in G minor composed by Albinoni, possibly as part of his Op. 4 set, around 1708. In his account, Giazotto then constructed the balance of the complete single-movement work based on this fragmentary theme. He copyrighted it and published it in 1958 under a title which, translated into English, reads \\"Adagio in G minor for strings and organ, on two thematic ideas and on a figured bass by Tomaso Albinoni\\".Remo Giazotto, Adagio in sol minore per archi e organo, su due spunti tematici e su un basso numerato di Tomaso Albinoni (Milan: Ricordi, 1958). Giazotto never produced the manuscript fragment, and no official record has been found of its presence in the collection of the Saxon State Library.Letter from the Saxon State Library (consultant Marina Lang), 24 September 1990, reproduced in facsimile by Wulf Dieter Lugert and Volker Sch√ºtz, \\"Adagio √† la Albinoni\\", Praxis des Musikunterrichts 53 (February 1998), pp. 13‚Äì22, here p. 15.

ABI can result in cognitive, physical, emotional, or behavioural impairments that lead to permanent or temporary changes in functioning. These impairments result from either traumatic brain injury (e.g. physical trauma due to accidents, assaults, neurosurgery, head injury etc.) or nontraumatic injury derived from either an internal or external source (e.g. stroke, brain tumours, infection, poisoning, hypoxia, ischemia, encephalopathy or substance abuse). ABI does not include damage to the brain resulting from neurodegenerative disorders. While research has demonstrated that thinking and behavior may be altered in virtually all forms of ABI, brain injury is itself a very complex phenomenon having dramatically varied effects. No two persons can expect the same outcome or resulting difficulties. The brain controls every part of human life: physical, intellectual, behavioral, social and emotional. When the brain is damaged, some part of a person's life will be adversely affected. Consequences of ABI often require a major life adjustment around the person's new circumstances, and making that adjustment is a critical factor in recovery and rehabilitation.The ABI Handbook, Serving Students with Acquired Brain Injuries in Higher Education, The Consortium for the Study of Programs for the Brain Injured in the California Community Colleges, 1997, California Community Colleges While the outcome of a given injury depends largely upon the nature and severity of the injury itself, appropriate treatment plays a vital role in determining the level of recovery.

Andrews McMeel Publishing (1998) *Anhedonia *Apraxia *Aphasia *Amnesia Behavioral manifestations: *Adynamia *Disinhibition *Emotional flooding *Perseveration =Emotional= ABI has been associated with a number of emotional difficulties such as depression, issues with self-control, managing anger impulses and challenges with problem- solving, these challenges also contribute to psychosocial concerns involving social anxiety, loneliness and lower levels of self esteem. These psychosocial problems have been found to contribute to other dilemmas such as reduced frequency of social contact and leisure activities, unemployment, family problems and marital difficulties. How the patient copes with the injury has been found to influence the level at which they experience the emotional complications correlated with ABI. Three coping strategies for emotions related to ABI have presented themselves in the research, approach-oriented coping, passive coping and avoidant coping. Approach-oriented coping has been found to be the most effective strategy, as it has been negatively correlated with rates of apathy and depression in ABI patients; this coping style is present in individuals who consciously work to minimize the emotional challenges of ABI. Passive coping has been characterized by the person choosing not to express emotions and a lack of motivation which can lead to poor outcomes for the individual. Increased levels of depression have been correlated to avoidance coping methods in patients with ABI; this strategy is represented in people who actively evade coping with emotions. These challenges and coping strategies should be kept in consideration when seeking to understand individuals suffering from ABI. =Memory= Following acquired brain injury it is common for patients to experience memory loss; memory disorders are one of the most prevalent cognitive deficits experienced in sufferers. However, because some aspects of memory are directly linked to attention, it can be challenging to assess what components of a deficit are caused by memory and which are fundamentally attention problems. There is often partial recovery of memory functioning following the initial recovery phase; however, permanent handicaps are often reported with ABI patients reporting significantly more memory difficulties when compared people without an acquired brain injury. In order to cope more efficiently with memory disorders many people with ABI use memory aids; these included external items such as diaries, notebooks and electronic organizers, internal strategies such as visual associations, and environmental adaptations such as labelling kitchen cupboards. Research has found that ABI patients use an increased number of memory aids after their injury than they did prior to it and these aids vary in their degree of effectiveness. One popular aid is the use of a diary. Studies have found that the use of a diary is more effective if it is paired with self-instructional training, as training leads to more frequent use of the diary over time and thus more successful use as a memory aid. Children In children and youth with pediatric acquired brain injury the cognitive and emotional difficulties that stem from their injury can negatively impact their level of participation in home, school and other social situations, participation in structured events has been found to be especially hindered under these circumstances. Involvement in social situations is important for the normal development of children as a means of gaining an understanding of how to effectively work together with others. Furthermore, young people with ABI are often reported as having insufficient problem solving skills. This has the potential to hinder their performance in various academic and social settings further. It is important for rehabilitation programs to deal with these challenges specific to children who have not fully developed at the time of their injury. Management Rehabilitation following an acquired brain injury does not follow a set protocol, due to the variety of mechanisms of injury and structures affected. Rather, rehabilitation is an individualized process that will often involve a multi-disciplinary approach. The rehabilitation team may include but is not limited to nurses, neurologists, physiotherapists, psychiatrists (particularly those specialized in Brain Injury Medicine), occupational therapists, speech- language pathologists, music therapists, and rehabilitation psychologists. Physical therapy and other professions may be utilized post- brain injury in order to control muscle tone, regain normal movement patterns, and maximize functional independence. Rehabilitation should be patient-centered and guided by the individual's needs and goals. There is some evidence that rhythmic auditory stimulation is beneficial in gait rehabilitation following a brain injury. Music therapy may assist patients to improve gait, arm swing while walking, communication, and quality of life after experiencing a stroke. Newer treatment methods such as virtual reality and robotics remain under- researched; however, there is reason to believe that virtual reality in upper limb rehabilitation may be useful, following an acquired brain injury. Due to few random control trials and generally weak evidence, more research is needed to gain a complete understanding of the ideal type and parameters of therapeutic interventions for treatment of acquired brain injuries. For more information on therapeutic interventions for acquired brain injury, see stroke and traumatic brain injury. =Memory= Some strategies for rehabilitating the memory of those affected by ABI have used repetitive tasks to attempt to increase the patients' ability to recall information. While this type of training increases performance on the task at hand, there is little evidence that the skills translate to improved performance on memory challenges outside of the laboratory. Awareness of memory strategies, motivation and dedication to increasing memory have been related to successful increases in memory capability among patients an example of this could be the use of attention process training and brain injury education in patients with memory disorders related to brain injury. These have been shown to increase memory functioning in patients based on self-report measures. Another strategy for improvement amongst individuals with poor memory functioning is the use of elaboration to improve encoding of items, one form of this strategy is called self-imagining whereby the patient imagines the event to be recalled from a more personal perspective. Self-imagining has been found to improve recognition memory by coding the event in a manner that is more individually salient to the subject. This effect has been found to improve recall in individuals with and without memory disorders. There is research evidence to suggest that rehabilitation programs that are geared toward the individual may have greater results than group-based interventions for improving memory in ABI patients because they are tailored to the symptoms experienced by the individual. More research is necessary in order to draw conclusions on how to improve memory among individuals with ABI that experience memory loss. Notable cases Phineas Gage's accident There have been many popularized cases of various forms of ABI such as: * Phineas Gage‚Äôs case of traumatic brain injury that greatly stimulated discussion on brain function and physiology * Henry Molaison, formerly known as patient H.M., underwent neurosurgery to remove scar tissue in his brain that was causing debilitating epileptic seizures, neurosurgeon William Beecher Scoville performed the surgery which created bilateral lesions near the hippocampus. These lesions helped remove symptoms of the epilepsy in Molaison but resulted in anterograde amnesia. Molaison has been studied by hundreds of researchers since this time, most notably Brenda Milner, and has been greatly influential in the study of memory and the brain. * Zasetsky injured in the Battle of Smolensk, bullet entered his left parieto-occipital area and resulted in a long coma. Following this, he developed a form of agnosia and became unable to perceive the right side of things.

It was licensed for release outside of Japan by Taito. In the USA, the game was published by Memetron, and the game was renamed to Solar Warrior. The European home computer ports renamed the game to Soldier of Light. Gameplay The main character, Xain, is a galactic bounty-hunter who must defeat evil forces who oppress five different planets. The player can select any order to play the various planets, so, there is no 'official' sequence of play (For the U.S. version, this game was released as 'Solar Warrior'. This version goes through a set sequence instead of having to choose planets). Each planet is played with right horizontal and vertical scrolling, shooting enemies and dodging natural hazards. Xain can crouch, double crouch (prone), jump and double jump. In some of the planets the player will need to kill a sub-boss to resume. Certain enemies carry a powerup which changes the default laser gun into a different weapon. The different weapons which are cycled through powerups include a laser-grenade gun, a 2-way gun, a spreadfire gun and a strong bullet gun with their own respective damage and directional firing capabilities. At the end of the planet, the player goes into battle with a boss. Once defeated, the player plants a bomb into the boss' base and has ten seconds to escape in a starship. The next half of the planet stage is an interlude stage during which the player must battle through waves of enemy ships while heading to the next planet. After three planets there is a battle through an asteroid field and against a giant mothership. When all five planets are liberated, the player will play the longer final stage on a gigantic metallic fortress, facing the bosses previously met on each of the five planets. Fighting bosses in this stage is optional. Halfway through the stage the player plants a bomb on the fortress core and has 60 seconds to reach the exit hangar and jump into the starship. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Xain'd Sleena on their January 15, 1987 issue as being the twelfth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. While giving the Commodore 64 port a score of 499 points, ACE compared the game to Firebird's game Crosswize.. The Games Machine gave the Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum ports scores of 70%, 77% and 86% respectively.

McNally was named a member of the NFL 1930s All-Decade Team and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1963, as one of the Hall of Fame's 17 charter members. McNally played for six different teams between 1925 and 1941, with his longest tenure being with the Green Bay Packers, first from 1929‚Äì33 and then from 1935‚Äì36. McNally served in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II. Following the war he attempted to return to football in 1945, but an injury ended his playing career. Biography =Early life= John Victor McNally Jr. was born as the fourth of six surviving children to parents, Mary and John McNally Sr. A native of New Richmond, Wisconsin, McNally graduated from high school at age 14. He never played high school sports, but earned letters in football, baseball, basketball, and track at Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota. McNally transferred to Notre Dame in 1926, but left school to play semi-professional football. He did not earn his degree until 1946 after retiring from the game. =College career= =Professional career= In 1922, while working for a newspaper in Minneapolis and still answering to the name John McNally, he and a friend, Ralph Hanson, heard they could make extra money by playing football for a semipro football team in the city. They decided to try out under fake names, which would protect McNally's amateur standing in case Notre Dame agreed to take McNally back someday after having been kicked out. They headed over to the team's practice field on McNally's motorcycle. \\"On the way there\\", McNally said, \\"we passed a theater on Hennepin Avenue, and up on the marquee I saw the name of the movie that was playing, Blood and Sand with Rudolph Valentino. Ralph was behind me on the motorcycle, and I turned my head and shouted, 'That's it. I'll be Blood and you be Sand.'\\" McNally made the team, but it was a few years before he made football history while playing with the Green Bay Packers and five other NFL teams. Starting in 1925, McNally made a tour of pro football franchises‚Äîthe Milwaukee Badgers (1925‚Äì26), Duluth Eskimos (1926‚Äì27), Pottsville Maroons (1928), Green Bay Packers (1929‚Äì33), Pittsburgh Pirates (1934), the Packers again (1935‚Äì36), and the Pirates again as player-coach (1937‚Äì39). McNally played in the National Football League for 14 seasons, with five different teams. In his prime, McNally was 6'1\\" and 188 lbs., known for his speed, agility, and pass-catching ability. He got his professional start in 1925 with the Milwaukee Badgers, where he became famous as the \\"Vagabond Halfback\\" for his off-the-field behavior and spontaneity. In 1926 and 1927 he played for the Duluth Eskimos,with fellow Pro Football Hall of Famer, Ernie Nevers, and in 1928 he played with the Pottsville Maroons. In 1928 McNally switched teams and came to Pottsville along with Walt Kiesling, another Pro Football Hall of Famer-to-be. On November 25, 1928, the NFL's Pottsville Maroons played the visiting Green Bay Packers at Minersville Park in a driving snow storm. In a 26-0 lopsided win over the Packers, McNally scored the last two touchdowns of the game; his second coming on a 65-yard run after an interception. Although no one at Minersville Park knew it at the time, that touchdown would be the last Pottsville would ever score in the NFL. After the Maroons folded in 1928, McNally went to the team against which he scored Pottsville's last NFL touchdowns: the Green Bay Packers. Between 1929‚Äì1933, 1935‚Äì1936, he played with the Packers where he helped them win four championships. He helped lead the Packers to three Championships in a row: 1929‚Äì1931, as well as in 1936. In 1937, McNally moved on to the Pittsburgh Steelers (then called the Pirates), where on his first play he ran back a kick 92 yards for a touchdown. He ended his NFL career in 1939 as the head coach of the Pirates. One day in 1941, McNally took a day off from his coaching duties for the Kenosha Cardinals minor league football team and played one game with the Buffalo Tigers of the third American Football League. =Green Bay Packers= When coach Curly Lambeau first negotiated a contract with McNally to play for the Green Bay Packers he offered him a $110 a week if he wouldn't drink after Wednesday and $100 a week if he did. McNally allegedly took the $100, although a later story said Lambeau said he would give him the $110 and let him drink on Wednesday for being so honest about it. McNally wore several different uniform numbers during his Packers career, including 14 (1933‚Äì34), 20 (1931‚Äì32), 24 (1929‚Äì30), 26 (1935), and 55 (1936). =Coaching career= The Pittsburgh's President Art Rooney hired McNally for the 1937 season to be both a player and a coach for the NFL's Pirates. In his first season as coach, McNally's team was able to muster only a 4‚Äì7 record, which was still good enough for 3rd place in the NFL Eastern conference. McNally and his squad fared worse in 1938, however, posting only a 2‚Äì9 record. They finished 5th out of six teams in the NFL Eastern conference. During the 1938 season, which would be McNally's last full season as coach, the Pirates were set to play the rival Philadelphia Eagles at Laidley Field in Charleston, West Virginia on November 20, but McNally was nowhere to be seen. As the story is often told, McNally was instead attending a football game at the Rose Bowl in Los Angeles. Friends in the press box questioned McNally as to why he was on the West Coast and he replied that the Pirates had an open date. The scoreboard, however, proved otherwise. Pittsburgh was on the road playing without its boss present. \\"I was going to fire him\\", Rooney later said, \\"But the players loved him. So I told him, 'John, you have to make the games.'\\" McNally began the Pirates' 1939 season as head coach, but following a 32‚Äì0 loss to the Chicago Bears at Forbes Field, and the third consecutive loss to start the season, McNally tendered his resignation to Rooney. The Pirates went 7‚Äì25‚Äì1 (.318) in his three seasons before being replaced by Walt Kiesling in 1939. Rooney later called McNally the most memorable character he knew during his career. \\"Nobody would even believe some of the things he did\\", said Rooney. \\"As one of our veterans once said, 'This is the only team I've been on where the players worry about the coach instead of the other way around.'\\" For the 1940 and 1941 seasons, McNally took over the coaching position with the Kenosha Cardinals, an independent pro team that had formerly played in the American Professional Football Association of 1939. For two games, he and two of his players loaned themselves to the Buffalo Tigers of the American Football League (1940), with McNally playing in one of the games. (By doing so, McNally became the only alumnus of the 1940 AFL to eventually reach the Hall of Fame.) McNally coached football again at St. John's University (Minnesota) from 1950 to 1952 where he amassed 13‚Äì9 record during his three-year stint. When leaving Saint John's he told incoming head coach John Gagliardi that \\"nobody can win at Saint John's.\\" Gagliardi went on to become the winningest head coach in college football regardless of division and coached at St. John's from 1953 until his retirement after the 2012 season. =Legendary antics= McNally earned a reputation for extracurricular exploits both on and off the football field that contributed to the legend of the man; it is generally accepted that some of McNally's exploits were tall tales. The exploits of McNally that can be substantiated include: * Jumping across a narrow ledge six stories from the ground to gain access to a Los Angeles hotel room. * Fleeing a towel fight with Packers end Lavvie Dilweg by climbing on top of a fast-moving train and crawling across car tops. After clinching the 1931 league championship, the Packers celebrated on the train ride back to Green Bay from New York with a party, which included an impromptu towel fight. During the towel fight, McNally angered the towering Dilweg, who chased McNally through the railroad cars and trapped him on the rear platform. McNally then hoisted himself on top of the car and made his way across the top of the moving train until he reached the engine compartment, where he spent the remainder of the trip. * Playing almost an entire game with a collapsed kidney. * Having to be rescued by teammates while attempting chin-ups on the stern's flagpole of the ocean liner SS Mariposa (1931) while traveling across the Pacific Ocean for a barnstorming game in Hawaii. * Riding the blinds between trains on the way to training camp to avoid having to pay a fare, which earned him the nickname \\"the Vagabond Halfback.\\" * Once ran 50 yards for a touchdown on a lateral from quarterback Red Dunn. When Dunn called the same play later in the game, McNally simply smiled and lateraled the ball back to him. * Climbing down the face of a hotel in downtown Chicago to avoid curfew and recite poetry to the swooning women below. * McNally was famous for perching on hotel ledges and the tops of bar tables as he sang the song Galway Bay. * He once passed up an opportunity to purchase an NFL franchise for $1200. * Alan Robinson of the Associated Press recalled that McNally \\"once pulled his car directly into the path of the team train that he'd missed during a late night of wine, women and song. He wasn't even fined, or suspended‚Äîafter all, he was the coach.\\" * Augie Ratner, a perfectly healthy ex-featherweight boxer, advertised his own funeral in a Minneapolis paper in 1971, to which McNally wrote, \\"I'll be sad when you are dead.\\" McNally then offered a bet on which of them would live longest; he wrote, \\"The one who goes first loses a grand to the one who survives. The loser won't miss the money, and it will console the winner for the loss of a friend. May I live a long time and you forever.\\" Ratner accepted the proposal; both men had the $1,000 bequest put into their wills. McNally, who survived six years after Ratner's death,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/18/archives/obituary-1-no- title.html?_r=0 won the bet. =Later in life= The day after Pearl Harbor was attacked in the Second World War, McNally enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps and served in India as a cryptographer. After the war McNally attempted to rejoin the Packers in 1945 but was injured by two tacklers while returning a punt in an exhibition game and retired permanently from professional football. Returning to St. John's, McNally earned a degree in 1946 and stayed a few years as a teacher and a coach for several different sports. Later he would return to his hometown of New Richmond, Wisconsin to run an employment agency. In 1958 McNally was an unsuccessful candidate for county sheriff running on a platform promising \\"honest wrestling.\\" McNally also entered the University of Minnesota at the age of 50, where he later earned his master's degree in economics. When the Pro Football Hall of Fame was founded in 1963, McNally was among the 17-member inaugural class, which included Curly Lambeau, Jim Thorpe, Sammy Baugh, and Bronko Nagurski. Then in 1970, when the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame was founded, McNally was among its first eight inductees. =After football= McNally was married twice; first to Marguerite Streater, whom he married in the 1940s, and then to Catherine Kopp, whom he married in 1966. On November 28, 1985, McNally died from the complications of a stroke in Palm Springs, California.Jim Campbell (2002). \\"McNally, John Victor ('Johnny Blood').\\" Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives, Thematic Series: Sports Figures. Charles Scribner's Sons. Retrieved January 7, 2013 from HighBeam Research He was 82. Though McNally was gone, his legacy was not. George Clooney's character‚ÄîDodge Connolly‚Äîin the 2008 film Leatherheads was based (in part) on McNally. Some said his life was made for Hollywood, but his wife Marguerite probably said it best when she said, \\"Even when Johnny does the expected, he does it in an unexpected way.\\" A marker for McNally is placed at Immaculate Conception Cemetery in New Richmond, Wisconsin.Vagabond Halfback Head coaching record =College= References External links  Category:1903 births Category:1985 deaths Category:American football halfbacks Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Buffalo Tigers players Category:Duluth Eskimos players Category:Green Bay Packers players Category:Milwaukee Badgers players Category:People from New Richmond, Wisconsin Category:Pittsburgh Pirates (football) coaches Category:Pittsburgh Pirates (football) players Category:Pottsville Maroons players Category:Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Saint John's Johnnies football coaches Category:Saint John's Johnnies football players Category:Sportspeople from Palm Springs, California Category:Catholics from California Category:Catholics from Wisconsin ","title":"Johnny &quot;Blood&quot; McNally"},{"id":"2601958","text":"is a volcanic Japanese island in the Philippine Sea. It is about south of the special wards of Tokyo, to which it belongs. It is part of the Izu archipelago and within the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. Its only municipality is Hachij≈ç. On 1 March 2018, its population was 7,522 people living on 63 km2. The Hachij≈ç language is spoken by some inhabitants, but it is considered an endangered language and the number of speakers is unknown. The island has been inhabited since the J≈çmon period, and was used as a place of exile during the Edo period. In modern times, it has been used for farming sugarcane and housing a secret submarine base during World War II; it is now a tourist destination within Japan. Hachij≈ç-jima receives about of precipitation annually. With a humid subtropical climate, and an average high temperature of , the island and the surrounding oceans support a wide variety of sea life, birds, mammals, plants, and other life. The tallest peak within the Izu Islands, a Class-C active volcano, is found there. Transportation to the island is either by air or ferry. There are many Japanese-style inns, hot spring resorts, and hotels to accommodate tourists and visitors. The island is a popular destination for surfers, divers and hikers. It has several local variations on Japanese foods, including shimazushi and kusaya, as well as many dishes that include the local plant ashitaba. Geography =Location= Hachij≈ç-jima is about south of the Izu Peninsula Translated by K√§the Roth.‚Äîor about south of Tokyo‚Äîin the Philippine Sea. The smaller island of Hachij≈ç- kojima is northwest of Hachij≈ç-jima, and can be seen from the top of Nishiyama. The Pacific Ocean is to the east of the island, with Mikura-jima about to the north and Aogashima about to the south. The island is within the boundaries of Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. =Municipalities= The only municipality on the island is the town of Hachij≈ç, which encompasses both Hachij≈ç-jima and the neighbouring Hachij≈ç-kojima, though no one lives on the latter. The town is divided into five areas: Mitsune (‰∏âÊ†π), Nakanogo (‰∏≠‰πãÈÉ∑), Kashitate (Ê®´Á´ã), Sueyoshi (Êú´Âêâ), and ≈åkago (Â§ßË≥ÄÈÉ∑). =Population= The population of Hachij≈ç-jima on 1 March 2018 was 7,522. =Language= The Hachij≈ç language is the most divergent form of Japanese; it is the only surviving descendant of Eastern Old Japanese. The number of speakers is not certain; it is on UNESCO's list of endangered languages, and is likely to be extinct by 2050 if counter-measures are not taken. =Flora and fauna= Since November 2015, humpback whales have been observed gathering around the island, far north from their known breeding areas in the Bonin Islands. All breeding activities except for giving births have been confirmed, and research is underway by the town of Hachij≈ç and the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology to determine whether Hachij≈ç-jima may become the northernmost breeding ground in the world, and possible expectations for opening a future tourism attraction. Whales can be viewed even from hot springs. Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, likely (re)colonised from Mikura-jima, also live around the island, among other cetaceans such as false killer whales, sperm whales, and orcas (being sighted during humpback whale research in 2017). The waters around the island are important for the nourishment of green sea turtles.Â≥∂Áî∞Ë≤¥Ë£ï. „ÄåÂÖ´‰∏àÂ≥∂Âë®Ëæ∫„Å´ÁîüÊÅØ„Åô„Çã„Ç¢„Ç™„Ç¶„Éü„Ç¨„É°„Äç„ÄÅ‰∫ÄÁî∞ÂíåÊàêÁ∑®„ÄÅ„ÄéÊó•Êú¨„ÅÆ„Ç¢„Ç™„Ç¶„Éü„Ç¨„É°„Äè (Êó•Êú¨„Ç¶„Éü„Ç¨„É°ÂçîË≠∞‰ºö, 2013), pp. 93-98\\\\.

The island is formed from two stratovolcanoes. ‚Äîalso called ‚Äîhas a height of and was active from 100,000 BC to around 1700 BC. It has eroded flanks and retains a distinctive caldera. ‚Äîalso called ‚Äîhas a height of . It is the highest point on the island and the tallest peak in the Izu island chain. The summit is occupied by a shallow caldera with a diameter of and a depth of around . It is rated as a Class-C active volcano by the Japan Meteorological Agency with recent eruptions recorded in 1487, 1518‚Äì1523, and 1605, with seismic activity as recently as 2002. Between these two peaks are over 20 flank volcanoes and pyroclastic cones. History Hachij≈ç-jima has been inhabited since at least the J≈çmon period, and archaeologists have found magatama and other remains. Under the Ritsury≈ç system of the early Nara period, the island was part of Suruga Province. It was transferred to Izu Province when Izu separated from Suruga in 680. During the Heian period, Minamoto no Tametomo was banished to Izu ≈åshima after a failed rebellion, but per a semi-legendary story, escaped to Hachij≈ç-jima, where he attempted to establish an independent kingdom. During the Edo period, the island became known as a place of exile for convicts, most notably Ukita Hideie, a daimy≈ç who was defeated at the Battle of Sekigahara. Originally the island was a place of exile mainly for political figures, but beginning in 1704 the criteria for banishment were broadened. Crimes punishable by banishment included murder, theft, arson, brawling, gambling, fraud, jailbreak, rape, and membership of an outlawed religious group. Criminals exiled to the island were never told the length of their sentences, and the history of the island is filled with foiled escape attempts. Its use as a prison island ended during the Meiji Restoration: after a general amnesty in 1868 most of the island's residents chose to move to the mainland; however, the policy of banishment was not officially abolished until 1881. Former U.S. president Ulysses S. Grant visited the island during his 1877 world tour. The island's residents were aware of his exploits in the American Civil War and gave him a jubilant welcome. He was ceremonially adopted by the village chief, being given the name Y≈´tarotaish≈ç; meaning \\"courageous general\\" in the local dialect, and was presented with prayer beads made with pearls and gemstones. He declared that the island's residents were the \\"friendliest people in the Pacific\\". In 1900, pioneers from Hachij≈ç became the first inhabitants of the Dait≈ç Islands, where they established a sugarcane farming industry. The Hachij≈ç language is still spoken on the islands to this day. Kaiten Type 1 suicide submarine used during World War II During World War II, the island was regarded as a strategic point in the defense of the ocean approaches to Tokyo; and in the final stages of the war, a base of operations for the Kaiten suicide submarines was founded on the southern coast. From the end of the war through the 1960s, the government made attempts to promote Hachij≈ç-jima as the \\"Hawaii of Japan\\" to encourage tourist development,\\"The Rise and Unravelling of the Hachijo Royal Hotel \\", Ridgeline Images, 17 April 2016. Retrieved 16 March 2018. and tourism remains a large component of the island's economy. There is a small mystery regarding the history of Hachij≈ç-jima, of potential significance to the history of \\"women's rights\\". Etsu Inagaki Sugimoto, a well known autobiographer from the early 20th Century states in A Daughter Of The Samurai that the island was commonly known in Japan during her childhood for being a place where standard gender roles were reversed; women did heavy field work and \\"made laws\\", and men tended the home and children. The mystery comes from the fact that no other current source mentions this today. A brief quote to illustrate the significance of the information: \\" 'We have a whole island where women do men's work from planting rice to making laws.' 'What do the men do?' 'Cook, keep house, take care of the children, and do the family washing.' 'You don't mean it!' exclaimed Miss Helen, and she sat down again. But I did mean it, and I told her of Hachijo, a little island about a hundred miles off the coast of Japan, where the women, tall, handsome, and straight, with their splendid hair coiled in an odd knot on the top of the head, and wearing long, loose gowns bound by a narrow sash tied in front, work in the rice fields, make oil from camellia seeds, spin and weave a peculiar yellow silk, which they carry in bundles on their heads over the mountains, at the same time driving tiny oxen, not much larger than dogs, also laden with rolls of silk to be sent to the mainland to be sold. And in addition to all this, they make some of the best laws we have, and see that they are properly carried out. In the meantime, the older men of the community, with babies strapped to their backs, go on errands or stand on the street gossiping and swaying to a sing-song lullaby; and the younger ones wash sweet potatoes, cut vegetables, and cook dinner; or, in big aprons, and with sleeves looped back, splash, rub, and wring out clothes at the edge of a stream.\\" LCC Card No 66-15849, pp 202‚Äì203  Transportation  Hachij≈ç-jima is accessible both by aircraft and by ferry.

When the hotel was built in 1963 it was one of the largest in Japan, and attracted visitors from all over the country. The hotel was finally closed in 2006 due to declining tourism to the island.

Hachij≈ç-jima is known for its hiking trails, waterfalls, and natural environment. Other activities for visitors include visiting the Botanical Park, exploring wartime tunnels, and hiking to the top of Hachij≈ç-fuji.

It featured the quiet Miss Jean introducing elementary school children to wild animals and other nature topics (for example, trees) in a calm setting around the namesake lodge. Hodgepodge Lodge was aired on PBS stations on the East Coast and syndicated for the rest of the nation in the early and mid-1970s. The host introduced the wonders of nature to national audiences, which included inner-city children, many of whom had never seen a garden or an animal in a setting other than a zoo. Miss Jean would do everything from opening up a pine cone and exploring its depths (which might have led to the discovery of a beetle or worm), to examining the habitat of a hedgehog or a red fox. Unfortunately, most episodes of Hodgepodge Lodge have been lost because the master tapes were erased to save money by allowing the tapes to be reused.

From Alexander the Buckhannon River flows generally northwardly, past Sago, to the city of Buckhannon, then northeastwardly into southwestern Barbour County, past Boulder (Rangoon Post Office) and Carrollton, where it is crossed by the Carrollton Covered Bridge.

The Buckhannon River in Buckhannon in 2006 According to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, approximately 79.5% of the Buckhannon River's watershed is forested, mostly deciduous; approximately 18.1% is used for agriculture and pasture; and less than 1% is urban. Name Local lore holds that the Buckhannon was named for Buckongahelas (died 1805), a Lenape ally of the British during the Revolutionary War. The most plausible accounts, however, indicate the river was named for clergyman John Buchannon, a missionary who explored the region in the 1780s. Fish life The uppermost (southernmost) stretch of the river downstream of Alexander drops approximately in its first and is boulder-strewn, providing habitat for trout (particularly brown trout), smallmouth bass, and rock bass. A low dam, installed for the provision of drinking water, forms a pool stretching upstream of Buckhannon to Sago; downstream of Sago, the Buckhannon is considered to be one of the best streams for muskellunge fishing in West Virginia. For downstream of Buckhannon, the river generally moves slowly between vegetation-covered banks over numerous submerged logs, providing habitat for muskies as well as smallmouth bass, rock bass, and carp. In its lowermost course above its mouth, the river assumes a higher gradient and is home to smallmouth bass, rock bass, and sunfish.

She is one of the first female rock and roll photographers. Wolf also makes fine art photography with an emphasis on women and global photojournalism. Early life Wolf was born in Los Angeles, California, on March 17, 1950 and raised in Sherman Oaks, California. Her mother, Barbara Wolf (n√©e Friedman), is a poet and was a fashion model and English literature teacher at Beverly Hills High School. Her father, Joseph Wolf, was a businessman and avid photographer. Wolf's interest in photography was born out of her father's passion for photography. He bought her first camera for her when she was a teenager. Wolf attended Hollywood High School and graduated in 1968. In 1969, she began dating Sandy Konikoff, the drummer for Jackson Browne. He invited her to live at Paxton Lodge in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, where Elektra Records was recording one of Browne's first albums. There was a darkroom at the studio, and she was inspired by the experience and made a decision to pursue photography professionally. Wolf's grandfather, Jules Wolf, managed the historic Lincoln Theater, often called the Apollo of the West.https://books.google.com/books?id=_nUJw2u7js4C&q;=Jules+Wolf+Lincoln+theater&dq;=Jules+Wolf+Lincoln+theater&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiytoeHh8PLAhUQ12MKHX1TDU8Q6AEIJzAC Rock & roll photography =1969 ‚Äì Fanny= In 1969, Wolf began working at Warner Bros./Reprise Records, where she met the first all-girl rock band to sign with a major record label, Fanny.

His record label informed him that he was to start a U.S. tour in six days, but he had just recently broken with his band, The Grease Band. Russell offered to quickly assemble a touring band, and recruited over 40 of his friends. Denny Cordell, who produced the tour, invited Wolf along after seeing her photography. She and Andee Nathanson were the two official photographers for the two-month U.S. concert tour, which included Russell, Rita Coolidge, Chris Stainton, Claudia Lennear, Bobby Keys, Pamela Polland, Matthew Moore, and musicians representing the Tulsa Sound including Carl Radle, Jim Keltner, and Chuck Blackwell. The music documentary Joe Cocker: Mad Dogs & Englishmen was released in 1971 and credited Wolf for her tour photography. Wolf authored Joe Cocker: Mad Dogs & Englishmen: A Memory Book, which included over 150 new photographs, quotes and stories from alumni. It was released in 2015 at the Lockn' Festival. On September 11, 2015, Wolf joined the Tedeschi Trucks Band & Friends and alumni from the 1970 Mad Dogs & Englishmen Tour, as the official photographer, and sang in the encore with the Space Choir, for a tribute concert to honor Joe Cocker and the Mad Dogs and Englishmen music.

It is the location of the Sorowako Mine, which is the largest open- pit mine in Indonesia, owned by PT Inco, a subsidiary of the Canadian based mining company Vale Inco. Geography It is located in the Verbeek mountains, Soroako is surrounded by three natural lakes: Lake Matano, Lake Towuti and Lake Mahalona. Matano Lake is the deepest lake in Indonesia. Matano Lake is surrounded by ring of small mountain rock. The weather sometimes can be very severe, often with thunder and lightning storms. Small earthquakes are common as well. Almost every year in December - January, a strange phenomenon occurs in the center of Matano Lake. A large tornado appears to stand still in the middle of the lake and remains there for a short time. Seen from shore the tornado looks to have a diameter of approximately 10 meters. While the tornado is standing still above the lake a cloud comes down to the surface of the lake and then seems to come up again through the funnel of the tornado. The source of Matano Lake is believed come from an area west of the lake that the native people call Matano village. In this area one can sometimes see white-bellied sea eagle. People Most of Soroako's residents work as employees for the mining company PT. Vale Indonesia, Tbk. (before PT. Inco). They come to Soroako from all over Indonesia. The rest of the population work primarily as farmers or fishermen. In the mountain side on the west side of town there is a natural cave that remains largely unexplored. Near the entrance is a chamber full of hundreds of skeletons that some say are the remains of a rebel force (PKI) from the 1950s and others claim is actually a native cemetery (similar to the cemetery caves of Tanah Toraja).

The main masonic influences (and external supervision) have been from the United Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and the Grand Lodge of Ireland. Today Regular Freemasonry is under the jurisdiction of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta, formed in 2004. Another self-styled, irregular masonic body going by the name ‚ÄòGrand Lodge of Malta‚Äô exists (whose members broke away from the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta in 2009). The Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta is recognized internationally by a majority of the Regular masonic jurisdictions worldwide, whilst the Grand Lodge of Malta is recognized by only two jurisdictions worldwide, one of which is the Grand Orient de France, an irregular Grand Lodge that unlike Regular Freemasonry throughout the world, admits women as masons within its ranks. The early years (1730‚Äì1800) =First lodge and early influences= Freemasonry in Malta began in 1730 when \\"Parfait Harmonie\\", the first warranted lodge, was formed under the Marseilles (France) masonic jurisdiction. By 1741, freemasonry was established firmly in Malta. Many knights of the Order of St. John, and some of the Maltese nobility, were freemasons.http://www.mha.org.au/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/33-malta- and-the-french-revolution Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca was a freemason,Read the website of the Masonic Hall Company of Malta. and others (including Grand Master De Rohan) are reported also to have been freemasons, and influential in the spread of freemasonry in Malta. The first Masonic lodges operated in Malta under French warrants generally obtained from Marseilles, but under the guidance of Count von Kollowrat, the Scottish Lodge of St. John of Marseilles petitioned the Grand Lodge of the Moderns in England to obtain an English warrant on 30 June 1788. This lodge noted in its petition that the most important members of the Order of St. John ranked amongst its membership. The lodge obtained an English warrant as the Lodge of St. John of Secrecy and Harmony. This lodge ceased to function sometime before 1813. =The French period= After the 1798‚Äì1800 French occupation of Malta, many French soldiers were incarcerated as prisoners of war. In 1811, they established a Masonic lodge named Les Amis en Captivite under a warrant from Marseilles. In that same year, the lodge was attacked by rioters, following exhortations from priests that the freemasons were responsible for the prevailing drought and disease stricken horses. Following repatriation of the bulk of prisoners between April and August 1814, the lodge members were essentially non-French. On 6 October 1819, the lodge obtained a warrant from United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE). The lodge was permitted to work in Italian. In 1820, the British Governor on the island, Thomas Maitland, suspended the lodge by reason of infiltration by the carbonari, an Italian secret society which purported to subvert Italian states. It nevertheless appears on the official list of UGLE up to 1824. Although some evidence has been presented to suggest that Napoleon Bonaparte was a Freemason, including a masonic apron said to have been his, and annotated with his name and masonic dates, now owned by Columbia Lodge No 2397 (London), there remains considerable uncertainty over the question. Several French sources cite similar accounts of his initiation into freemasonry in Malta in 1798 in a French Regimental Lodge, probably Army Philadelphe Lodge, but the earliest of these sources dates to some years after the events described, and there is no extant primary source, such as a Lodge minute book or attendance register. A number of masonic scholars have explored the available evidence, but none has felt able to form a definite opinion for or against the evidence.Paper by J. E. S. Tuckett, presented at Quatuor Coronati Lodge, reproduced by the Grand Lodge of Iowa. Freemasonry during British rule (1800‚Äì1964) Malta came under effective British control in 1800, and was formally part of the British Empire from 1814 until 1964. During this time organised Freemasonry developed in Malta. Early in 1815, a petition for the creation of the Lodge of St. John and St. Paul was submitted to the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE). The lodge‚Äôs warrant was signed by the Grand Master, the Duke of Sussex, on 27 November 1815. This lodge is the oldest English lodge that still meets on the island. From 1822 John Hookham Frere was a member of the Lodge, becoming its treasurer in 1823. He remained part of the organization until 1843.Cassar, Paul, \\"Hookham Frere in Malta\\", p. 57. By 1890 there were five lodges under English (UGLE) jurisdiction, with a total of 409 masons. All of the English lodges in Malta were organised into a District Grand Lodge in 1849, and thereafter had a local District Grand Master and District officers. By 1900 the number of lodges had increased to seven, with a total of 584 members; by 1919 there were 1,484 freemasons in Malta under the UGLE constitution. During the same period of British rule there were three other regular lodges consecrated in Malta, two by the Grand Lodge of Ireland, and one by the Grand Lodge of Scotland. British Freemasonry since independence (1964‚Äìpresent) =English Constitution= On 21 September 1964, Malta gained independence. Following the withdrawal of British forces from the island, and the shutdown of the British naval base on 31 March 1979, a significant proportion of the active members returned to the United Kingdom. As a result, all but two of the English lodges were relocated to England; of the two lodges remaining in Malta, one was unable to survive and surrendered its warrant, leaving the Lodge of St. John and St. Paul No 349 (the oldest of the English lodges in Malta) still meeting on the island. In 1984, the English District Grand Lodge of Malta, having been relocated to England, was dissolved. Following the dissolution, UGLE appointed a Grand Inspector, a senior officer of the Grand Lodge with responsibility for supervising English Freemasonry in Malta. A further two English lodges were subsequently consecrated, taking the total to three. At the formation of the new Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta in 2004, each local lodge had to decide to remain under its home jurisdiction or join the new Maltese constitution. One of the three UGLE lodges became a founding lodge of the new Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta, leaving two (Lodge of St John & St Paul No 349, and De Rohan Installed Masters Lodge No 9670) still under English jurisdiction. =Irish Constitution= During the colonial period, there were two Lodges warranted in Malta by the Grand Lodge of Ireland: the Leinster Lodge No 387 founded in 1851, and the Abercorn Lodge No 273 founded in 1899. Later, following independence, the Grand Lodge of Ireland warranted two further lodges: the Fenici Lodge No 906 in 1991, and Hospitalliers Lodge No 931 in 2004. On the formation of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta in 2004, all of these Irish lodges became founding members of the new Grand Lodge. As a result there is no extant Irish Freemasonry in Malta today. =Scottish Constitution= There is just one lodge in Malta under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. The Lodge of St. Andrew No 966 was founded in 1904, and has continued to operate since Maltese independence. It did not join in the formation of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta in 2004, and still reports directly to the Grand Lodge of Scotland in Edinburgh. The Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta (2004) On 5 September 2004, at a time of Maltese nationalist celebrations marking 40 years of Maltese independence, and 25 years since the closure of the British naval base, and in anticipation of the admission of Malta into the European Union, three of the four Irish Constitution lodges met together and resolved to form themselves into the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta. This historic move was supported by one of the English (UGLE) lodges on the island, Count Roger of Normandy Lodge No 9285, and at a special meeting held on 30 June 2004 the lodge resolved to unite with the Irish lodges in the formation of the new Grand Lodge. The fourth Irish Constitution lodge also decided to participate. Following these events, the Grand Lodge of Ireland, in consultation with the United Grand Lodge of England and the Grand Lodge of Scotland, acceded to the petition of the five lodges. On 18 November 2004, with the Grand Master of Ireland presiding, these 5 lodges were instituted and consecrated by the Grand Lodge of Ireland into The Sovereign Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Malta (SGLoM).See page 4 of this newsletter published by the Grand Lodge of Ireland. The effect of having a Grand Lodge is that SGLoM has become the sovereign Masonic body for the Maltese islands, having inherent power and authority to form a Constitution as its fundamental law, and subject only to the Ancient Landmarks of Freemasonry to enact laws for its own government and that of its subordinate Lodges. The remaining lodges of other constitutions (two English and one Scottish) may continue to meet in Malta, but new lodges may be founded only by the SGLoM. For months, the representatives of the five founding lodges met and drafted a Book of Constitutions which was adopted at the constituting Grand Lodge Meeting on 18 November 2004. The first Grand Master of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta was Joseph Cordina. In April 2005, a research lodge was consecrated named Ars Discendi (Art of Learning), and in November 2005 the lodge Flos Mundi (Flower of the World) was consecrated. This latter lodge was intended to attract Maltese and Italian brethren and works in the Italian language. A further new lodge was founded in 2010, named White Sea Lodge.See official list of lodges of Malta. In April 2011 the lodge Mare Nostrum was consecrated taking the number of subordinate lodges to nine. The Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta follows the English and Commonwealth pattern of Freemasonry (as opposed to the alternative Scottish Rite, York Rite, and Swedish Rite styles). This means that Malta recognises the three degrees of Craft Freemasonry (Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason), plus the Order of Royal Arch Freemasonry, as collectively forming the whole of \\"pure ancient Freemasonry\\". As in England, Royal Arch Chapters may be formed in Malta (with the consent of the Grand Master) and each such Chapter must be attached to a warranted Lodge, and bear the same name and number as that lodge.These regulations are stated here in the Book of Constitutions of the SGLoM. The Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta is recognised by most regular Grand Lodges worldwide. The Grand Lodge of Malta (2009) On 16 December 2009 a significant number of Maltese Freemasons belonging to Abercorn Lodge, Mikiel Anton Vassalli Lodge, and Logga Fenici withdrew their membership from the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta and established a new Grand Lodge of Malta. They contended that the Constitution of the Sovereign Grand Lodge had been significantly amended so that the Grand Master had been granted absolute powers. They also proposed to establish a masonic Supreme Council to have jurisdiction over the Grand Lodge, a practice which is considered irregular by the majority of the world's established Grand Lodges, including the 'home constitutions', or Grand Lodges of England, Ireland, and Scotland. The Grand Lodge of Malta (2009) has been recognized by the Grand Orient de France, the Gran Loggia D'Italia and a number of other bodies practicing Continental Freemasonry, considered irregular by the Grand Lodges of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The new Grand Lodge has not been recognised by any of the Regular Masonic jurisdictions worldwide, all of which continue to recognise the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta (2004). The Grand Lodge of Malta attracted newspaper headlines when Dr David Gatt (a Grand Chancellor of the body) was arrested by Maltese police and charged with a range of serious organised crime offences. He was acquitted in 2017 and all charges quashedSee the case reports of the Malta Today newspaper. Notable buildings and residences Some notable residences used by the freemasons in Malta are Villa Blye in Paola, Casa Viani in Valletta, and Villa Sunshine in Ta' Xbiex.Stationed in Malta.

The name means Yahweh (Yah) is salvation (Shua). Etymology The Messiah's name is explained in where it tells us that 'he shall save his people from their sins'. The 'he' relates to Yahweh, while the 'save his people' element relates to one of the four Hebrew verbs meaning salvation, most likely 'Yahsha'. Here is reflected the name of the Messiah. The attempted transliteration of the Hebrew name into English by most Bible translations give the variation \\"Jehoshua\\". However, the form Jehoshua is questionable in that firstly, the vowel points which dictate this form of transliteration are less ancient than the letters of the word having been introduced between 600 and 900 C.E. The Assemblies of Yahweh are consistent, in that with the Name Yahweh, and with the name Yahshua, they reject the vowel points added to this name as it produces a hybrid word i.e. Jehoshua. According to Josephus, in the The Jewish War, Book 5, Chapter 5, Section 7, as well as Hebrew grammar books, the first three letters of the Sacred Name are actually vowels. When the Name Yahweh appears in the name of a person, it was always intended to be abbreviated by using the form 'Yah' (). The whole Tetragrammaton is never applied to the name of a mortal in the Sacred Scriptures, only the abbreviated form. Since these letters are vowels and not consonants, it is impossible to pronounce them as YEHU. They must be pronounced YAHW as they are equivalent to the English vowels IAU. Jacob O. Meyer writes: The last two letters of the savior's name is in . It is pronounced \\"shua\\" as according to the Strong's Concordance #8668. Hence you have the name Yahshua. Language of the New Testament Charles Torrey, a prominent and notable scholar, maintained that all the gospels were originally written in Aramaic and that our extant text is a translation. In The Quest of the Historical Jesus, Albert Schweitzer says: The following is a quote from Robert Taylor‚Äôs Diegeses, published 1869: Scholarly sources suggest that the New Testament was not originally written in Koine Greek. The oldest extant manuscripts of the New Testament are a few centuries younger than the originals. The Assemblies of Yahweh believe that during this time these manuscripts, which we have in Greek, most likely were translated. As a result, the names Yahweh and Yahshua should have appeared in the original Hebrew or Aramaic texts. There is scriptural evidence to suggest that the apostles were using these Hebrew names such as in . Due to the decision by Jews to no longer pronounce the name, the message of Yahshua ‚Äì that Yahweh is salvation ‚Äì would have angered many. George Howard of the University of Georgia considers the possibility that the Tetragrammaton was retained in the first documents of the Greek translation just as it had been retained in the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures Although the original manuscripts could be called inspired, Meyer writes that \\"there is no such thing as an inspired translation\\". Mistakes are sometimes made in translation and these are passed down to each subsequent translation. An example of a perceived mistake by a translator translating the Hebrew original manuscripts is found in Revelation 19:16. The scripture here says that the Messiah has a name written on His thigh. This lacks sense, but when considering the original Hebrew language the root problem becomes clear. As explained by the Assemblies of Yahweh: Yahshua, Yeshua, or Jesus Some time after the destruction of Solomon's Temple, the use of God's name as it was written ceased among the Jews, and they began to use titles such as Hashem and Adonai to refer to Yahweh. The Theological Dictionary of the New Testament states that the \\"Greek form of a list of OT characters who in pre-exilic Hebrew are called ◊ô÷∞◊î◊ï÷π◊©÷ª◊Å◊¢÷∑ and usually after the Exile ◊ô÷µ◊©◊Å◊ï÷º◊¢÷∑ [Yeshua']\\".Werner Foerster, \\"·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ,\\" ed. Gerhard Kittel, Geoffrey W. Bromiley, and Gerhard Friedrich, Theological Dictionary of the New Testament (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1964‚Äì), 284. Thus the term Yeshua seems to be supported by scholarly works to be a post-Exilic innovation. The Assemblies of Yahweh believe there was a ploy to prevent the name of Yahweh (or Yah) appearing in the Messiah's name: =Using the term Jesus= Since there is a likelihood that the New Testament was not originally written in Greek, there is no reason to use the term Jesus. Further, since it is provable that the consonantal letter J sound is a recent invention in the English language, created by a printer by the name of Gilles Beys in 1565, it has to be asked how the Messiah‚Äôs name was pronounced before then. Thus the Assemblies of Yahweh concludes that the word Jesus is no older than the 16th or 17th century. The term that we actually find for the Messiah‚Äôs name is Jesus (Greek ), however this is only an attempted transliteration from the original into the Greek language. Meyer writes: Furthermore, Meyer says the term Jesus has actually been linked etymologically to the pagan Greek deity Zeus. =Using the term Yeshua= Meyer writes: Criticisms =Yahshua is not Hebrew= Dr. Michael Brown, a Jewish-Christian pastor and Hebrew scholar, emphatically denies that ‚ÄúYahshua‚Äù was the Hebrew name of Jesus: =A silent 'waw'= Critics say that in their labor to get the pronunciation \\"Yahshua\\" out of ◊ô◊î◊ï◊©◊¢, they are ignoring Hebrew linguistics that do not allow the waw to be silent. However, Meyer writes: =Pre-1900s= Another criticism is that the name Yahshua cannot be found with that spelling anywhere in history or in Hebrew writings prior to the 1900s.60 Questions Christians Ask About Jewish Beliefs and Practices 2011 \\"According to the late A.

The bacterium causes ovine brucellosis, along with Brucella ovis. It affects primarily sheep and goats, but cases have also been observed in cattle, yaks, water buffalo, Bactrian and dromedary camels, alpacas, dogs, horses and pigs. Humans can become infected if they have contact with an infected animal or its byproducts. Animals acquire B. melitensis by venereal transmission and contact with the placenta, fetus, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharges from infected animals. The organism is found in blood, urine, milk, and semen. It is zoonotic, unlike B. ovis, causing Malta fever or localized brucellosis in humans. Brucella melitensis colonies growing on agar Pathogenesis and disease The bacterium causes severe inflammation of the epididymis, with formation of spermatocoeles and fibrinous adhesions. This disease is known as ovine brucellosis, and is a reportable disease in the USA. In goats and sheep, B. melitensis can cause abortion, stillbirth, and weak offspring for the first gestation after the animal is infected. Mastitis can happen, but is uncommon. The infection can also reduce milk yield by at least 10%. The placenta might also be retained, and the animal can suffer from purulent vaginal discharge. In males, the infection can cause acute orchitis and epididymitis, and in turn infertility. Arthritis can also occur. Brucellosis can be confirmed with the help of post mortem lesions in the reproductive tract, udders, and supramammary lymph nodes. While these are not pathognomonic for brucellosis, they can help farmers determine if their herds are infected.  Transmission  = In animals = B. melitensis is transmitted to animals through contact with the placenta, fetus, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharge of infected animals. = In humans = B. melitensis can be transmitted to humans through ingestion of contaminated dairy products. It can also be transmitted to humans via inhalation of the organism or by direct contact with infected animal secretions. Human to human transmission is exceptionally rare, occurring via blood transfusion, organ and tissue transplantation, sexual contact, and breastfeeding. History In 1887, Micrococcus melitensis was isolated in Malta by David Bruce from the spleen of a soldier who had died from acute brucellosis. The mechanism of transmission was not determined until 1905, when Temi ≈ªammit found that apparently healthy goats could infect humans with M. melitensis via their milk. The genus of Micrococcus was later renamed Brucella, in honor of David Bruce. The bacterium was detected in a 3200-year- old cheese which was found in the Tomb of Ptahmose (vizier) in 2010, by researchers at the University of Catania.

They are in the form of a wearable plastic ring with a large hard candy \\"jewel\\" and come in an assortment of flavors.  History  Ring Pops were invented in the late 1970s by a man named Frank Richards who was a product engineer at the Topps Company. He wanted to help his daughter in breaking her thumb-sucking habit, so he invented the Ring Pop as a treat to eliminate her childish addiction. This treat is similar to a baby pacifier, where the jewel is made out of a hard candy, and is attached to a plastic disc that clamps around a finger. It was thought to be a brilliant idea and solution to get kids to stop their thumb-sucking habit, while enjoying a sugary and sweet piece of candy instead of sucking on their bland thumb. While the Ring Pop was not the first piece of candy jewelry, it did follow in the footsteps of other jewelry themed candies, such as the candy necklace and candy bracelet, both of which were released in 1958, almost two decades before the invention of the Ring Pop. Candy jewelry was thought to be on the more feminine side, however Topps insured to provide colors that would suit to the male consumers as well, such as blue and green.  Media  The debut of Ring Pops on television was in the early 1980s, catching many children's attention with its memorable theme song and the famous phrase, \\"It's a lollipop, without a stick! A ring of flavor you can lick!\\" The commercial entails many children eating and having fun with Ring Pops, however there is a scene with two children, a boy and a girl, where the little boy is supposedly proposing to the little girl with the Ring Pop. This scene has become a signature staple over the years as one of the most memorable scenes in Ring Pop commercial history. Variations Actress Melissa Joan Hart models a Ring Pop The candy originally was available in two flavors, Cherry and Grape. Over time, Ring Pop flavors have expanded into an array of flavors, such as Blue Raspberry, Strawberry, Watermelon, Lime, and Apple. Ring Pop Sours came into the mix in the 1980s in flavors such as, Sour Green Apple, Sour Cherry Berry, Sour Watermelon, Sour Lemonade, Sour Cherry, and Sour Raspberry Lemonade. Topps has also released Ring Pop \\"twisted\\" multi-flavored lollipops, which come in flavors such as, Berry Blast and Citrus Craze, as well as creamy varieties, such as Strawberry Ice Cream. Most recently, in 2013, Topps has come out with Ring Pop Gummies as an alternative to the original hard candy. Special Ring Pops are made for some holidays. Easter Ring Pops use the traditional plastic ring but replace the gem-shaped hard candy with chicks or bunnies. In 2011, Bazooka issued Ring Pops encrusted with Swarovski Crystal and colored with Maverick Blue to the Dallas Mavericks for their winning of the 2011 NBA Finals. Topps launched Ring Pop Gummies in 2013, a wearable and edible gummi version of the candy. = Dietary = Bazooka Candy Brands, a division of Topps Inc., claims Ring Pops to be one of their best selling candies amongst the Orthodox Union because it is one of the few candies that are kosher.

Life He was the son of King Rudolph II, the first ruler over the united territories of Upper and Lower Burgundy since 933, and his consort Bertha, a daughter of Duke Burchard II of Swabia. Some sources call him Conrad III, since he was the third Conrad in his family: his great-grandfather was Duke Conrad II, whose father was Count Conrad I. According to the chronicler Ekkehard IV, in a story that is probably apocryphal, when Conrad learned that both the Magyars and the Saracens of Fraxinetum were marching against him, he sent envoys to both armies warning them of the other. The envoys offered Burgundian aid to each invader against the other and then informed them of the other's whereabouts. When the Magyars and Saracens met, the Burgundians held back and only attacked when the opposing forces were spent.

Its holdings include R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, American Snuff Company (formerly Conwood Company), Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, and Niconovum AB. Reynolds American's subsidiaries manufacture and market a variety of tobacco products, including cigarettes (Newport, Camel, Pall Mall, Kent, Doral, Misty, Capri, and Natural American Spirit brands) and moist snuff (Grizzly and Kodiak brands). In 2010, Reynolds American's operating companies sold about 28% of all cigarettes sold in the U.S. In July 2014, Reynolds American announced the purchase of Lorillard Tobacco Company in a deal valued at $27 billion. In January 2017, Reynolds American agreed to be purchased by British American Tobacco for $49.4 billion. History Reynolds American was formed in January 2004 and began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange as RAI in August 2004. In July 2004 the U.S. business of British American Tobacco (Batus Inc. and Brown & Williamson) combined with that of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (R. J. Reynolds), under the \\"R. J. Reynolds\\" name. RJR and Brown & Williamson were the second and third-ranking U.S. tobacco companies prior to the combination. After combination, R. J. Reynolds became a subsidiary of Reynolds American, with BAT holding a 42% share of RAI. Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, which manufactures the additive-free Natural American Spirit brand of tobacco products, also became a subsidiary of Reynolds American at that time. Prior to becoming RAI operating companies, both R. J. Reynolds and Santa Fe were part of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc., which traded on the New York Stock Exchange as RJR. RJR became a subsidiary of RAI in July 2004. R. J. Reynolds was established as a tobacco company in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in 1875. In 2006, Reynolds American expanded into the smokeless tobacco category, with the acquisition of Conwood, the second-biggest smokeless tobacco company in the United States. Conwood manufactures and markets moist and dry snuff, loose leaf, plug, and twist chewing tobaccos. At the time of the acquisition, 70% of Conwood's sales came from the growing moist-snuff segment, with the Grizzly brand showing the fastest growth. Grizzly's continued growth since 2006 has made it the best- selling brand in the moist-snuff category. In 2008, RAI was recognized as a leader in corporate sustainability by being added to the membership in the 2008-2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index (DJSI North American). RAI is the only U.S. tobacco company and one of 125 North American companies on the index. Selection for the Index is based on performance in a number of economic, environmental and social criteria. The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2009 that Reynolds American intended to buy Sweden-based Niconovum AB, a maker of products such as nicotine gum, for $44.5 million. The deal was completed in December. Former Chairman, President and CEO of Reynolds Tobacco Daniel \\"Daan\\" Delen assumed the positions of President and CEO of Reynolds American on March 1, 2011, after former president, CEO, and chairwoman Susan Ivey announced she would retire as chairwoman November 1, 2010 and as President and CEO effective February 28, 2011. Ivey, now known as Susan Cameron, returned as CEO in April 2014 after being elected by the board of directors. In July 2014, Reynolds American, Inc. announced it would buy Lorillard Tobacco Company for roughly $25 billion a result of slowed sales. The deal is valued at $27.4 billion, including debt. Reynolds agreed to pay $68.88 in cash and stock for every Lorillard share and assume its debt. The deal also included the sale of the Kool, Winston, Salem, and blu brands to Imperial for $7.1 billion. The merger became official on June 12, 2015. On September 15, 2016, the former speaker of the US House, John Boehner, joined the board of Reynolds American. On October 21, 2016, British American Tobacco announced that it had offered to buy the remaining 57.8 percent of Reynolds American for $47 billion. In January 2017, Reynolds American agreed to a $49.4 billion deal, expected to close in the third quarter of the year after approval from both companies' boards of directors. The deal was completed July 25, 2017. On February 25, 2020, Chief Judge Rodney Gilstrap of the United States District for the Eastern District of Texas determined that Reynolds remained liable for its full portion of an annual $8 billion dollar settlement payment based on a settlement agreement that Reynolds reached with the State of Texas in 1998. https://news.bloomberglaw.com/product-liability-and-toxics- law/reynolds-owes-for-former-brands-under-1998-tobacco-deal-judge Reynolds had previously claimed that its divestiture of several brands to Imperial had extinguished its obligation to make payments for those brands under the 1998 Settlement Agreement.

It was founded in 1937 by Josiah K. (J. K.) Lilly Sr. and his sons, Eli Jr. and Josiah Jr. (Joe), with an initial gift of Eli Lilly and Company stock valued at $280,000 USD ($ in 2015 chained dollars). As of 2014 its total assets are worth $9.96 billion. J. K. Lilly Sr. initially served on the foundation's board and became its largest contributor. Over time he donated Eli Lilly and Company stock worth a total of $86.8 million to the foundation, including a $30 million bequest following his death in 1948. J. K's sons, Eli and Joe, contributed additional Eli Lilly and Company stock that had a combined value of $6.8 million. Eli also managed the foundation in its early years. The Lilly Endowment's first full-time staff members, Josiah K. Lilly III and G. Harold Duling, were hired in 1951. By the mid-1970s the foundation's staff had increased to seventy-five and it had moved to larger headquarters at 2801 North Meridian Street in Indianapolis.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., pp. 915‚Äì16. As required under the Tax Reform Act of 1969, the Lilly Endowment diversified its holdings, but its assets consist primarily of Eli Lilly and Company stock. In 1998 the Lilly Endowment became the wealthiest philanthropic endowment in the world in terms of assets (estimated value of $15.4 billion) and charitable giving. As of 2014 it remains among the top five in terms of total assets ($9.96 billion). The private family foundation is a separate entity from the Eli Lilly and Company pharmaceutical firm, and maintains its headquarters in a different location. With the exception of the Eli Lilly and Company stock that the foundation holds in its portfolio, the Lilly Endowment is not linked to the Lilly pharmaceutical company. The non-profit foundation has its own board of directors to manage its affairs and an executive committee (trustees) that reviews grant requests. The Lilly Endowment has historically focused on three primary grant areas: community development, education and Christianity. It is the largest private foundation in the United States that funds almost exclusively in its home city and state, and is one of few major foundations to fund religion.  Recipients  Although it has provided gifts with a national and global reach, the Lilly Endowment's primary geographic focus has been in Indianapolis and in Indiana.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds. p. 914. Early recipients included the Indianapolis Community Chest, a forerunner of the United Way, the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, Christ Church Cathedral, among other Protestant and, later, Catholic institutions in the state, and several Indiana colleges and universities, such as Wabash College and Earlham College.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 915. Other major gifts helped to fund construction projects in downtown Indianapolis, including the Indiana Convention Center, the Hoosier Dome (the city's first, domed stadium), and restoration of several of the city's historic buildings, including the Hilbert Circle Theater, the Indiana Theater, and grants to construct the Indianapolis Zoo, Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, and sports facilities on the Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Indianapolis campus and elsewhere in the city.Bodehamer and Barrows, eds., p. 916. One of the Lilly Endowment's most remarkable achievements is its Giving Indiana Funds for Tomorrow (GIFT) initiative. Since 1987 the initiative has been responsible for starting and growing Indiana community foundations. Indiana has more community foundations than any other state, with combined assets of nearly $3.6 billion. From its inception the Lilly Endowment has supported numerous religious endeavors. These include Indianapolis's Christ Church Cathedral. J. K. Lilly Sr. was involved with the church throughout his life, beginning as a choirboy. Upon Lilly's death, a stipulation of his bequest to the church was that it remain in the heart of downtown Indianapolis. Lilly supported a wide variety of religious endeavors, which he considered an important means of promoting character development. Institutions and programs funded by Lilly grants have included: *1966: The Youth Ministry project ($50,000) *1974: Readiness for Ministry for the Association of Theological Schools *1976‚Äì82: The introduction of the Readiness for Ministry program to Association of Theological Schools seminaries *1981: Study of Early Adolescents and Their Parents ($273,000) *1988: Effective Christian Education: A National Study of Protestant Congregations *1999‚Äì2002: Programs for the Theological Exploration of Vocation. Eighty-eight colleges and universities received a total of $136.5 million to establish or strengthen programs that assisted students in examining the relationship between faith and vocational choices, provided opportunities for gifted young people to explore Christian ministry, and enhanced the capacity of school faculty and staff to effectively teach and mentor students. *2003: Emory University's Youth Theological Initiative (under the university's Candler School of Theology), a center for research and theological youth education that has become a model for such programs across the nation ($2,182,200 over four years) *2010: Manchester University (formerly Manchester College) received $35 million from the Lilly Endowment to establish its College of Pharmacy at the school's Fort Wayne, Indiana, campus. It is the state's third school of pharmacy. The inaugural class, enrolled in the fall of 2012, will graduate in the spring of 2016. *2019: Religion News Foundation's Global Religion Journalism Initiative to expand news reporting on religion around the world. It is funded by an 18-month, $4.9 million grant from Lilly Endowment and is a collaborative effort among the Associated Press (AP), Religion News Service (RNS), and The Conversation US (TCUS). The grant represents one of the largest investments in religion journalism in decades. The initiative will create a joint global religion news desk to improve general understanding, analyze the significance of developments in the world of faith, and explain religious practices and principles that underlie current events and cultural movements. Other Lilly Endowments beneficiaries have included: *The Rockefeller-funded and ecumenical Association of Theological Schools *Search Institute, a psychology-based, not-for-profit, ecumenical youth research organization supported by grants and contracts from foundations, corporations and government agencies, proceeds from the sales of products and services, and tax-deductible contributions from individuals and organizations. *The ecumenical Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) congregations, whose Bethany Project was formed to revitalize congregations by patterning its ministry after Charles E. Fuller, the father of New Evangelicalism. *The Hudson Institute, a conservative nonprofit think tank * Climate change denial efforts  Art collection  Over the years the Lilly Endowment has acquired a collection of important Indiana paintings that were in danger of leaving the state, including works by William Merritt Chase, John Elwood Bundy, and members of the Hoosier Group. The works of art are generally displayed at the foundation's offices on North Meridian Street in Indianapolis. In 2003-05, a number of the paintings appeared in museums around Indiana as part of a special exhibition.

For electrolytes, it could be understood as a capacity of acid/base to ionize itself. A low degree of ionization is sometimes called partially ionized (also weakly ionized), and a high degree of ionization as fully ionized. However, fully ionized can also mean that an ion has no electrons left. Ionization refers to the process whereby an atom or molecule loses one or several electrons from its atomic orbital, or conversely gains an additional one, from an incoming free electron (electron attachment). In both cases, the atom or molecule is no more a neutral particle and becomes a charge carrier. If the species has lost one or several electrons, it becomes positively charged and is called a positive ion, or cation. On the contrary, if the species has gained one or several additional electrons, it becomes negatively charged and is called a negative ion, or anion. Individual free electrons and ions in a plasma have very short lives typically inferior to the microsecond, as ionization and recombination, excitation and relaxation are collective continuous processes. Chemistry usage The degree of dissociation Œ± (also known as degree of ionization), is a way of representing the strength of an acid. It is defined as the ratio of the number of ionized molecules and the number of molecules dissolved in water. It can be represented as a decimal number or as a percentage. One can classify strong acids as those having ionization degrees above 30%, weak acids as those with Œ± below 30%, and the rest as moderate acids, at a specified molar concentration. Physics usage In gases, the degree of ionization \\\\alpha refers to the proportion of neutral particles that are ionized into charged particles: : \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{n_i}{n_i + n_n} where n_i is the ion density and n_n the neutral density (in particles per cubic meter). It is a dimensionless number, most of the time expressed as a percentage. In a plasma, the electron-ion collision frequency u_{ei} is much greater than the electron-neutral collision frequency u_{en}. Therefore, with a weak degree of ionization \\\\alpha, the electron-ion collision frequency can equal the electron-neutral collision frequency: u_{ei} = u_{en} is the limit separating a plasma from being partially or fully ionized. The term fully ionized gas introduced by Lyman Spitzer does not mean the degree of ionization is unity, but only that the plasma is in a Coulomb- collision dominated regime, i.e. when u_{ei} > u_{en}, which can correspond to a degree of ionization as low as 0.01%. A partially or weakly ionized gas means the plasma is not dominated by Coulomb collisions, i.e. when u_{ei} < u_{en}. Sometimes \\"fully ionized\\" means there are no orbital electrons left. A particular case of fully ionizes gases are very hot thermonuclear plasmas, such as plasmas artificially produced in nuclear explosions or naturally formed in our Sun and all stars in the universe. Stars contain largely hydrogen and helium gases, that are fully ionized into electrons, protons (H+) and helium ions (He++). Equations to characterize such very hot, fully ionized thermonuclear plasmas in the presence of stellar magnetic fields can be approximated to ideal magnetohydrodynamics laws with high magnetic Reynolds number. History Ionized matter was first identified in a discharge tube (or Crookes tube), and so described by Sir William Crookes in 1879 (he called it \\"radiant matter\\").Crookes presented a lecture to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, in Sheffield, on Friday, 22 August 1879 The nature of the Crookes tube \\"cathode ray\\" matter was subsequently identified by English physicist Sir J.J. Thomson in 1897,Announced in his evening lecture to the Royal Institution on Friday, 30 April 1897, and published in Philosophical Magazine, 44, 293 and dubbed \\"plasma\\" by Irving Langmuir in 1928,I. Langmuir, \\"Oscillations in ionized gases,\\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S., vol. 14, p. 628, 1928 perhaps because it reminded him of a blood plasma.G. L.

At Caoxieshan and Chuodun, sites of the Majiabang culture, archaeologists excavated paddy fields, indicating the centrality of rice to the economy. In addition faunal remains excavated from Majiabang archaeological sites indicated that people had domesticated pigs. However, the remains of sika and roe deer have been found, showing that people were not totally reliant on agricultural production. Archaeological sites also bear evidence that Majiabang people produced jade ornaments. In the lower stratum of the Songze excavation site in Shanghai's modern day Qingpu District, archaeologists found the prone skeleton of one of the area's earliest inhabitantsa 25‚Äì30-year-old male with an almost complete skull dated to the Majiabang era.

As an independent company, it existed as an film exhibitor and cable television service provider. Famous Players operated numerous movie theatre locations in Canada from British Columbia to Newfoundland and Labrador. The company was owned by Viacom Canada but was sold to Onex Corporation-owned Cineplex Galaxy LP in 2005. History =Beginnings= Famous Players Canadian Corporation dates back to the early days of Famous Players Film Company (later Paramount Pictures), founded in 1912, as its earliest predecessor, though that company did not have any operations in Canada until 1920, when it bought Nathan Nathanson's Paramount Theatre chain, which Nathanson had established four years earlier.The Canadian \\"Paramount Theatre\\" chain was not affiliated with the American chain with the same name. Nathanson, along with being the 5th richest person in the world, became the first president of the resulting entity, Famous Players Canadian Corporation Limited. In 1923, Famous Players bought out rival Allen Theatres, acquiring many buildings in the process . The Famous Players Theatres chain was always strongly linked with Paramount, and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Paramount Communications at the time that firm was acquired by Viacom in 1994. Some of the most high-profile and popular theatres in the Famous Players chain were the Imperial and the Uptown in Toronto; and the Capitol, Orpheum, Stanley, and Strand in Vancouver. Originally began with 13 theatres located in Ontario and British Columbia, the company quickly expanded its holdings to 100 by the end of 1926. Until the 1950s, the company continued to build its operations in the movie theatre sector. In 1952, however, Famous Players began to invest in the new technology. First, the company purchased the rights to a coinbox system that connected to television sets. A year later, it purchased its first broadcasting assets, CKCO-TV in Kitchener, Ontario and CFCM-TV in Quebec City. At the end of the 1950s, the company acquired the first of many cable TV companies it would come to own, thus adding control over the distribution of its TV product. As the industry grew, starting in the mid-1960s, so did the assets of Famous Players in this segment. In 1971, the company sold off the majority of its shareholdings in its movie theatre and other non-TV-related entertainment holdings to Gulf + Western Canada and subsequently changed its name to Canadian Cablesystems Limited, reflecting the new focus of its operations. Canadian Cablesystems was the owner and operator of Metro Cable, which served parts of Metro Toronto, as well as a minority shareholder in several other cable companies, until it was purchased by Rogers Cablesystems Ltd. (founded by Ted Rogers) in 1978.\\"Rogers defends its bid to buy Canadian Cablesystems\\". The Globe and Mail, September 13, 1978. Most famously, Famous Players Theatres allowed the lease on a property containing the entrance of one of its flagship Toronto locations, the Imperial Six, to lapse in 1986. Cineplex immediately took over the lease, denying Famous Players Theatres access to the portion of the property that they already owned outright. Famous Players eventually sold its property to Cineplex Odeon Cinemas, on the condition it never again be used to show filmed entertainment. Cineplex's live-theatre division renovated the theatre; renamed the Pantages Theatre, it hosted The Phantom of the Opera for ten years. The theatre was renamed the Canon in 2001 and then again in 2011 as the Ed Mirvish Theatre, which it is currently known, in honour of the popular businessman and ironically Mr. Drabinsky's main competitor in live theatre in Toronto.Canon Theatre renamed in honour of Ed Mirvish  Toronto Star. Thestar.com (2011-12-06). Retrieved on 2013-12-09. =Growth= Famous Players expanded throughout the 1990s. Under chairman John Bailey, Famous Players re-built its infrastructure from 1996 to 2003 with new \\"megaplex\\" theatre brands featuring stadium seating, such as SilverCity and Coliseum, with food courts and video games. Around that time, AMC Theatres entered the Canadian market, and most of the traditional ties between the existing chains and the major studios began to unwind, putting all three chains in full-on competition in several major markets. The company once operated a number of drive-in theatres, but most have been closed and replaced with modern theatres. Until 2004, it operated theatres in the Maritimes, none of which were branded-concept theatres; these were sold to the region's dominant exhibitor, Empire Theatres. =Sale to Cineplex Galaxy and aftermath= In February 2005, Viacom announced the sale of Famous Players for $400 million.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/viacom-may- sell-billion-dollar-baby/article18217012/ Cineplex Galaxy, controlled by Onex Corporation acquired Famous Players from Viacom for $500 million (about US$397 million) in June 2005, with the deal being completed on July 22. To satisfy antitrust concerns, on August 22, 2005 the group announced the sale of 27 locations in Ontario and western Canada to Empire Theatres. In December 2019, UK-based Cineworld plans to acquire the now renamed Cineplex Entertainment which will see the former 47 Famous Players theatres into the fold. The sale will make Cineworld the largest cinema chain in North America with the ownership of Regal Cinemas. The company stated that Cineplex's operations were to be integrated with Regal, and that it planned to reach $120 million in cost efficiencies and revenue synergies including the adoption of a subscription service scheme similar to Regal and Cineworld. Assets =Theatres= Famous Players Pickering (replaced by Cineplex Cinemas Pickering and VIP) Prior to merging with Cineplex, Famous Players operated five theatre brands: Famous Players, SilverCity (), Coliseum (), Colossus and Paramount. Of these, Cineplex only preserved the first two brands, which amount to 20 locations as of 2019. The Coliseum and Colossus theatres sold to Cineplex were renamed to Cineplex Cinemas, though the unique features of the original brands were preserved. Similarly, Paramount theatres now use the Scotiabank Theatre brand since 2007. In addition, Landmark Cinemas also acquired many of the Famous Players theatres that were formerly operated by Empire Theatres. Many theatres had served Pepsi products in addition to popcorn with restaurants such as Burger King, New York Fries, Wetzel's Pretzels, Taco Bell, TCBY, Baskin Robbins and Starbucks. Those were heavily replaced by Coca-Cola and Outtakes with some theatres retaining Starbucks.

It is often used on very large projects to aid code comprehension to find source code, functions, declarations, definitions and regular expressions given a text string. cscope is free and released under a BSD license. The original developer of cscope is Joe Steffen. History The history of the tool goes back to the days of the PDP-11,The History of Cscope but it is still used by developers who are accustomed to using the vi or Vim editor or other text-based editors, instead of editors based on graphical user interfaces (GUI)s. The functions in cscope are available to varying degrees in modern graphical source editors. Mode of use cscope is used in two phases. First a developer builds the cscope database. The developer can often use \`find\` or other Unix tools to get the list of filenames needed to index into a file called \`cscope.files\`. The developer then builds a database using the command \`cscope -b -q -k\`. The \`k\` flag is intended to build a database for an operating system or C library source code. It will not look in \`/usr/include\`. Second, the developer can now search those files using the command \`cscope -d\`. Often an index must be rebuilt whenever changes are made to files. In software development it is often very useful to be able to find the callers of a function because this is the way to understand how code works and what other parts of the program expect from a function. cscope can find the callers and callees of functions, but it is not a compiler and it does that by searching the text for keywords. This has the disadvantages that macros and duplicate symbol names can generate an unclear graph. There are other programs that can extract this information by parsing the source codencc - The new generation C compiler or looking at the generated object files. cscope was created to search content within C files, but it can also be used (with some limits) for C++ and Java files.CScope home page: \\"The fuzzy parser supports C, but is flexible enough to be useful for C++ and Java[...]\\" GUI frontends Three graphical user interface (GUI) frontends are available for cscope which ease its use. * Kscope runs on KDE and integrates the Kate text editor.

The French Quarter is basically within the original \\"walled\\" city of Charleston. The area began being called the French Quarter in 1973 when preservation efforts began for warehouse buildings on the Lodge Alley block. The name recognizes the high concentration of French merchants in the area's history. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Chalmers Street in the French Quarter District, May 2010 The neighborhood was settled as part of the original Grande Modell of Charles Towne in 1680. It is famous for its art galleries; it also has many restaurants and places of commerce as well as Charleston's Waterfront Park. Charleston's French Quarter is home to many fine historic buildings, among them, the Pink House Tavern, built around 1712, and the Old Slave Mart, built by Z.B. Oakes in 1859. Also in the French Quarter are the Dock Street Theatre, arguably the first site of theatrical productions in the United States, and the French Huguenot Church, a beautiful Gothic Revival church which houses the sole-surviving French Calvinist Congregation in the United States. St. Philip's Episcopal Church, the first congregation in Charleston, whose current building dates to 1835, is also in the French Quarter. St. Philip's graveyard is the final resting place of Edward Rutledge, the youngest signer of the Declaration of Independence, and U.S. Senator and Vice President John C. Calhoun, whose body was exumed during the Civil War and buried near the church in an unmarked grave. Later, after the war, his body was moved back to its original location and a memorial constructed in the 1880s.

Then PXI adds integrated timing and synchronization that is used to route synchronization clocks, and triggers internally. PXI is a future-proof technology, and is designed to be simply and quickly reprogrammed as test, measurement, and automation requirements change. Most PXI instrument modules are register-based products, which use software drivers hosted on a PC to configure them as useful instruments, taking advantage of the increasing power of PCs to improve hardware access and simplify embedded software in the modules. The open architecture allows hardware to be reconfigured to provide new facilities and features that are difficult to emulate in comparable bench instruments. PXI system data bandwidth performance easily exceeds the performance of the older VXI test standard. There is debate within the technical community as to whether newer standards such as LXI will surpass PXI in both performance and overall cost of ownership. PXI modules providing the instrument functions are plugged into a PXI chassis which may include its own controller running an industry standard operating system such as Windows 7, Windows XP, Windows 2000, or Linux (which is not yet PXI System Alliance approved), or a PCI-to-PXI bridge that provides a high-speed link to a desktop PC controller. Likewise, multiple PXI racks can be linked together with PCI bridge cards, to build very large systems such as multiple source microwave signal generator test stands for complex ATE applications. CompactPCI and PXI products are interchangeable, i.e. they can be used in either CompactPCI or PXI chassis, but installation in the alternate chassis type may eliminate certain clocking and triggering features. So for example you could mount a CompactPCI Network interface controller in a PXI rack to provide additional network interface functions to a test stand. Conversely, a PXI module installed in a CompactPCI chassis would not utilize the additional clocking and triggering features of the PXI module. PXI Systems Alliance PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI) is a modular instrumentation platform originally introduced in 1997 by National Instruments. PXI is promoted by the 69-member PXI Systems Alliance (PXISA), whose sponsor members are (in alphabetical order) ADLINK, Cobham Wireless, Keysight Technologies, Marvin Test Solutions, National Instruments, Pickering Interfaces and Teradyne. Executive Members of the alliance include Alfamation, Beijing Pansino Solutions Technology Co., CHROMA ATE Inc, GOEPEL electronic, MAC Panel, and Virginia Panel Corp. Another 56 associate member organizations that do not have voting rights are supporting PXI and use the PXI logo on their products and marketing material. = Two major players in 2006 = In 2006 two major players, National Instruments and Agilent Technologies (now Keysight Technologies), entered the PXI test market. * National Instruments; National Instruments introduced the CompactPCI-based PXI standard in 1990s.

PXI Express PXI Express is an adaptation of PCI Express to the PXI form factor, developed in 2005. This increases the available system data rate to 6 GByte/s in each direction. PXI Express also allows for the use of hybrid slots, compatible with both PXI and PXI Express modules. In 2015 National Instruments extended the standard to use PCI Express 3.x, increasing the system bandwidth to 24 GByte/s.  MXI link  An MXI link provides a PC with direct control over the PXI backplane and connected cards using a PXI card and a connected PCI/CompactPCI card. This interface provides a maximum data throughput of using fiber-optic or copper cabling, and can support a maximum length of using a fiber-optic connection. PXI MultiComputing (PXImc) PXImc is an interconnection standard that allows multiple PXI systems to be linked together, with each system potentially including both instrumentation and processing. Using PXImc, data gathered from one system can be processed in parallel on multiple computing nodes, or a single PC can access instruments in several PXI chassis.

He stands tall and weighs . He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers and Los Angeles Dodgers. He bats and throws right-handed. Baker grew up in Shreveport, Louisiana, and attended Oklahoma State University. He was drafted by the Twins in the second round of the 2003 amateur entry draft and reached the major leagues in 2005. In 2006, he made their starting rotation out of Spring training but struggled and was sent to the minor leagues for most of the rest of the season. Beginning 2007 in the minors, he was called up in May and nearly threw a perfect game on August 31. He went 11-4 in 2008 and posted a 3.45 earned run average (ERA). In 2009, Baker logged a career-high 200 innings and started the American League (AL) tiebreaker game against the Detroit Tigers which the Twins won to advance to the postseason. He had a 12-9 record in 2010 but battled injuries towards the end of the year and was left out of the Twins' postseason rotation. Injuries limited Baker in 2011 again, but he was the only Twins' pitcher to post a winning record. He missed 2012 after undergoing Tommy John surgery; this also caused him to miss most of 2013, which he spent with the Chicago Cubs. He began 2014 in the minor leagues but was later added to the Texas Rangers' roster. Baker started eight games for the Rangers but was used mainly as a relief pitcher. In 2015, he signed with the New York Yankees but was released before the season started. Signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers, he started two games for them, the last appearances of his major league career. Early years Baker was born September 19, 1981, in Shreveport, Louisiana. He attended Captain Shreve High School in Shreveport, graduating in 2000. He was selected to the All-State team his senior year and played college baseball at Oklahoma State University. In the 2001 season, he was named a Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American. In 2002, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named a league all-star. In the 2003 season, he was named to the second team All-Big 12. In 2009‚Äì10, Baker became part of Captain Shreve's \\"Circle of Honor.\\" Draft and minor league career Baker was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the second round (58th overall) of the 2003 Major League Baseball draft. He began his minor league career with the Class A Quad Cities River Bandits that same year. In 2004, he played for the Class A-ADvanced Fort Myers Miracle, Double-A New Britain Rock Cats, and Triple-A Rochester Red Wings, where he would spend the rest of his minor league career outside of rehab assignments until 2014. In 2004, he won a combined 10 games. He pitched the majority of his 2005 and 2006 seasons with Rochester. He pitched just seven games in 2007 for the Red Wings before being called up to pitch the rest of his 2007 season with the Twins. Major league career =Minnesota Twins= 2005 season Baker was called up on May 2, 2005; Baseball Prospectus speculated he might make starts in place of Kyle Lohse; Twins' manager Ron Gardenhire said he might be used to start if Lohse did not continue to improve. Baker did not wind up starting, making his MLB debut by pitching one scoreless inning out of the bullpen in an 8‚Äì1 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on May 7. That was his only appearance with the Twins in May. He was recalled in July to make his first major league start. On July 5, he pitched five innings, giving up just two runs on five hits and striking out five; however, he took the loss in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Though he was expected to get sent back to Rochester, Twins' manager Ron Gardenhire had praise for him, saying after the game, \\"We think we have a quality major leaguer ready to go, and he kind of proved that theory again.\\" A few weeks later, on July 23, Baker had his first career win in Detroit with a 5-2 victory over the Tigers in Game 2 of a doubleheader. He started and pitched seven strong innings, allowing just two runs, but was sent back to Rochester immediately after the game, as he had been called up specifically to start in the doubleheader. On August 29, he returned to the Twins starting rotation for the remainder of the year, making seven consecutive starts to close the season as he replaced Joe Mays in the rotation. Baker finished his rookie year with a record of 3-3 and an earned run average (ERA) of 3.35. 2006 season Baker beat out Francisco Liriano to earn the Twins' No. 5 starting spot out of Spring training. But he struggled with his command, unable to keep the ball down, and did not live up to the expectations following his rookie season. The 2-5 start with a 6.06 ERA caused Baker to be demoted to Rochester on June 1. Baker ended up spending nearly the entire second half with the Rochester Red Wings, making only a handful of starts after the demotion. While the Twins played great baseball after a 25-33 start by winning the division on the last game of the regular season, Baker's season was a major disappointment. He finished the year with a 5-8 record and a 6.37 ERA in 83.1 innings, with two of the wins coming against the New York Yankees. Baker did not make the Twins' postseason roster. 2007 season Baker struggled in 2007 spring training, opening the season with Rochester. In May, though, the Twins removed Sidney Ponson from the rotation, giving Baker a chance to start again. In his first start of the season, on May 19, he pitched into the ninth inning, allowing two runs in a 5-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. On July 26, after scuffling in several starts, he struck out a career-high nine hitters over seven innings in a 12-inning, 2-1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. He pitched a complete game on July 1, allowing only a home run to Marcus Thames, but that run was the only run of the game in a 1-0 loss to Detroit. He threw eight shutout innings on August 5, earning the victory in a 1-0 win over the Cleveland Indians. On August 31, Baker took a perfect game into the ninth inning against the Kansas City Royals at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome during the second game of a doubleheader, but lost his bid for perfection when he issued a walk to the first batter he faced in the ninth, John Buck. The second hitter after Buck that he faced, Mike Sweeney, hit a single, ending Baker's bid for a no-hitter. Baker finished the game by beating the Royals 5-0 allowing just one hit and completing his second complete game of his career. In 24 games, 23 of which were starts, Baker had a 9-9 record, a 4.26 ERA, and 102 strikeouts in innings. 2008 season Baker opened the 2008 season as the Twins' fifth starter. He won his first two starts of the season, the first coming on April 4 and the second coming on April 9. However, he placed was on the disabled list (DL) on May 7 with a strained right groin. This was the first DL stint of his career, and it lasted until June 5. On June 15, 2008, Baker became the first Minnesota Twins pitcher to ever throw four strikeouts in the same inning. In the 3rd inning against the Milwaukee Brewers, Baker struck out Ryan Braun, then struck out Prince Fielder, but the ball bounced away from catcher Mike Redmond, so Fielder went to first base. Baker then proceeded to strike out Russell Branyan and Mike Cameron. The last pitcher to record such a feat was Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Brad Penny, who did it on September 23, 2006 against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Baker picked up his first career hit against Josh Banks on June 26 and earned the win in a 4-3 victory over the San Diego Padres. On July 20, Baker opened a game against the Texas Rangers with perfect innings but again wound up losing a game in which he pitched eight innings 1-0 when he allowed a solo home run to Taylor Teagarden. On August 21, he allowed one run in eight innings and earned a no-decision in a 12-inning, 2-1 victory over the Angels. Baker finished the season 11-4 with a 3.45 ERA and 141 strikeouts. His 0.48 ground ball/fly ball ratio was the lowest in the major leagues for 2008. The Twins finished the season tied with the Chicago White Sox for the American League (AL) Central lead, but the White Sox won a one- game playoff, eliminating the Twins. 2009 season Baker was expected to be the Twins' Opening Day starter, but he opened the 2009 season on the disabled list with right shoulder stiffness and posted a 9.15 ERA in his first four starts when he returned. On May 3, he no-hit the Royals through six innings, but he gave up five runs in the seventh inning of that game. He earned his first win on May 8, pitching seven shutout innings in an 11-0 victory over the Seattle Mariners. On May 24, he gave up three runs in innings and earned the win in a 6-3 victory over Milwaukee. Baker began trying to stand taller in his delivery, and on June 4 he struck out a career-high 10 batters in an 11-3 victory over the Indians. Baker went 4-0 in June, and from July 12 through September 5, he set a career-high with seven straight wins. On August 14, he had a two-hit shutout in an 11-0 win over Cleveland. After sitting seven games out of the AL Central lead on September 6, the Twins forced a tiebreaker with the Tigers, and Baker made the start. He allowed three runs over six innings, left eligible for the win, but took a no- decision. However, the Twins won 6-5 in 12 innings to clinch a trip to the playoffs. He led the Twins with 15 wins, 162 strikeouts, and finished second on the team behind Nick Blackburn with a 4.37 ERA, while pitching a career high 200 innings. However, the Twins were swept in three games in the AL Division Series (ALDS) against the Yankees, preventing Baker from making any playoff appearances. 2010 season Baker started on Opening Day for the Twins to kick off the 2010 season against the Angels but allowed four runs in innings, taking the loss in a 6-3 defeat. He won his next start, allowing one run in seven innings in a 2-1 victory over the Chicago White Sox on April 10. Through May 8, he went 4-2. On June 16, Baker struck out a career-best 12 batters through seven innings in a 2-1 victory over the Colorado Rockies. He picked up his 50th career win on July 2, allowing one run in seven innings in a 2-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays. On August 10, he allowed five runs (four earned) in six innings but earned his 10th win of the season in a 12-6 victory over the White Sox. He left a start with elbow pain on September 2 and did not pitch again until September 21. Baker finished the season on a 9-1 stretch and helped the Twins repeat as winners of the AL Central. In 29 starts, he had a 12-9 record, a 4.49 ERA, and 148 strikeouts in innings. During the season, he moved from 22nd to 12th all-time on the Twins' strikeout list. Baker was left out of the Twins' postseason rotation, though he was a member of their bullpen. He made his playoff debut in Game 3 of the ALDS, allowing one run in innings as the Twins were again swept by the Yankees. 2011 season Baker had to compete with Kevin Slowey for the starting rotation in 2011, but he won the competition and entered the season as the Twins' No. 5 starter. He threw seven shutout innings on April 21 in a 3-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. He threw a complete game on June 11, allowing one run and striking out seven in an 8-1 victory over the Rangers. One week later, he threw eight shutout innings and had 10 strikeouts in a 1-0 victory over the San Diego Padres. Baker had a strong season before missing time with injuries. His ERA at the end of July was 2.86, and he made two starts in August before spending much of the rest of the season on the disabled list with an injured elbow. He finished the season with an 8-6 record and a 3.14 ERA. Baker was the Twins only starting pitcher to have a winning record in 2011, and he led the team in ERA, strikeouts (123), and WHIP (1.17). 2012 season Baker began 2012 on the disabled list due to elbow tendinitis. He made a rehab start with the Class A Fort Myers Miracle in their first game of the season but threw just 11 pitches in the start before leaving the game after talking to the trainers. It was announced on April 11 that Baker would miss the entire 2012 season with Tommy John surgery. Baker said, \\"It's something that I've been battling for a while. I don't mind pitching through pain, as long as you don't have the chance to further the injury. But when it comes to a point where your velocity's not there and you don't have the ability to finish pitches like you know you're capable of doing, then something's got to be done.\\" On October 29, the Twins announced they declined their club option for Baker worth $9.25 million, ending Baker's tenure with the team. =Chicago Cubs= On November 13, 2012, the Chicago Cubs announced they signed Baker to a one-year deal worth $5.5 million with $1.5 million in possible bonuses. Due to various setbacks and injuries that lingered throughout the season, Baker did not pitch for the Cubs until September. He made his first start since 2011 on September 8, pitching five shutout innings in a 3‚Äì1 loss to the Brewers. \\"It felt very good,\\" Baker said after the game. \\"There were some emotions there. It's been a long road and I was happy my family was here to share this moment because they're just as much a part of this as I am. Rehab process is hard on everyone just not the player himself. It's been a long road so that definitely plays into it being a very special day for me and my family.\\" He started three games for the Cubs, with no record and a 3.60 ERA in 15 innings. =Seattle Mariners= Baker signed a minor- league deal with the Seattle Mariners on January 29, 2014. After posting a 6.75 ERA in four Spring training starts with the Mariners and refusing a minor league assignment, Baker was released on March 24. =Texas Rangers= On March 25, 2014 he signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers. He was brought up to the Rangers on May 7, to serve as a long reliever. He was designated for assignment after throwing innings of relief in a game, with the Rangers needing more-rested arms in their bullpen, but he was soon recalled. He was added to the rotation on May 23 when the Rangers moved Robbie Ross to the bullpen. However, Baker returned to a long relief role after two starts when Joe Saunders came off the DL. Late in the season, Baker was again used as a starter, making starts August 24, August 29, September 5, and September 27. In 25 games (eight starts), Baker had a 3-4 record, a 5.47 ERA, 55 strikeouts, and 14 walks in innings. On October 30, he became a free agent. =New York Yankees= Baker with the New York Yankees In late January 2015, Baker signed with the New York Yankees to a minor league contract worth $1.5 million if he made the major league roster. He struggled in spring training, allowing nine earned runs in innings before drawing his release on March 29. =Los Angeles Dodgers= In April 2015, he signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and was assigned to the Triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers. He made three starts for Oklahoma City in April and was 1‚Äì1 with a 1.06 ERA. In a seven inning game (shortened due to it being the first game of a doubleheader) against the Iowa Cubs on April 20, Baker came within one strike of pitching a perfect game, retiring the first 20 batters he faced before Addison Russell's double up the middle with two strikes on him. The Dodgers purchased his contract and called him up to the Majors to make a spot start against the San Diego Padres on April 26. He made two starts for the Dodgers and was 0‚Äì1 with a 5.73 ERA before he was designated for assignment on May 3, 2015. He made 13 starts in Triple-A and was 7‚Äì3 with a 3.39 ERA. He left a start in July because of injury and spent the rest of the season on the disabled list. Pitching style Baker threw a fastball, a cut fastball, a slider, a changeup, and a curveball. The fastball was his main pitch, which he threw over 60 percent of the time; it had an average velocity in the high nineties for much of his career. After Baker's return in 2013, his average fastball velocity had dropped to the high eighties, and he stopped throwing the curveball after the 2013 season. Baker has been a good control pitcher throughout his career, finishing in the top 10 in the American League in strikeout-to-walk ratio three times. He has the fourth-best strikeout-to-walk ratio in the history of the Twins, including their time as the Washington Senators, at 3.438 (behind Slowey's 4.702, Jim Merritt's 3.904, and Johan Santana's 3.794); he also has the eighth-best strikeouts per 9 innings pitched number in Twins' history (7.234). Personal life Baker and his wife Leann have two sons, Eli and Easton. He is known for being soft-spoken. Since a \\"young age\\", Baker has been a Christian. He says, \\"I can't tell you how much I appreciated my parents for [bringing me to church]\\" and that he is \\"eternally grateful.\\" He especially enjoys Paul's letters to the churches, saying, \\"It gives you hope... insight... peace in our daily lives.\\" He credited his faith with helping him after he was sent to the minor leagues in 2006.

The show premiered in January 1982 and ran until 2004. It was produced by the Israeli Educational Television (IETV), and to this day remains successful in re-runs on IETV's home network, Channel 23. The show was originally produced by Shoshana Tzachor. Its head writer was Datia Ben Dor, who provided scripts for most of the early shows, as well as lyrics and music to many of the featured songs. The puppets were all designed by Yehudit Greenspan. The show's title refers to a then well-known nursery rhyme by Fania Bergstein.  Overview  The show consists of interactions between humans and puppets. Each episode presents the young viewers with familiar situations from everyday life, and offers creative ways of solving various problems, as each situation is dealt with through songs and games. Aside from the basic plotline, most episodes also include a story told by one or more of the human actors, and sometimes short cartoon sketches. In the sketches about Pete and Pitagoras (different actors) professor Pitagoras tried to teach the kids but his assistant Pete always ruined everything. The location for most shows (until 1995) is a room filled with various shapes, such as poles and arches, vaguely resembling a room in a house. This deliberately surreal design is meant to give the impression of seeing the world from an infant's point of view, which is full of imagination and creativity.  Revival  In 1995 the show's production was put on a long hiatus, following the death of Yoni Chen, one of the puppeteers. It was revived in 1998 with a renewed and very different look. It now had a realistic house and a realistic back yard as the two main locations. The puppets were re-designed and there were considerable changes in the human cast as well. Responses for the new version were mostly negative. Original creator Datia Ben Dor said in an interview (translation from Hebrew is non-literal): \\"The work on the show was no longer done with the proper care and sensitivity... it was no longer \\"Parpar Nechmad\\"... the name remained but the essence was gone\\". The second version aired its final episode in 2004. On July 18, 2008 it was first published that IETV planned to revive the show once again, and that auditions for the new human cast would soon take place. Reportedly, all four puppet characters would appear on the new version, which would focus on teaching children about good nutrition and health. After some time, the new version was cancelled. On February, 2020 it was first published that IPBC plans to revive the show after 16 years of reruns in Kan Educational.https://timeout.co.il/%d7%a4%d7%a8%d7%a4%d7%a8-%d7%a0%d7%97%d7%9e%d7%93-%d7%97%d7%95%d7%96%d7%a8%d7%aa/ Parpar Nechmad will return to a new season with all beloved characters  Cast  Uza, Batz, and recordings cassettes at the IETV building = Puppet Characters = * Uza (◊ê◊ï◊ñ◊î) (performer: Irit Shilo) - a female goose.

The song is often performed as a drinking song and is intended as a tribute to the mythical inventor of beer, Charlie Mops.  History  It is not known where the song was created. There are numerous theories as to where in the British Isles it originated from. It is often held to have been created in Irish pubs however another theory puts it as being created in the 1800s in music halls in the British Isles. Another theory hold that it is an English folk song passed down through the years. It was originally published commercially in volume 10 of English folk magazine Sing as well as later Sing Out!, the American equivalent. It was noted that the three pubs mentioned in the song are based in London along the River Thames. In 1956, the song was taken to Australia, presumably by English sailors, and became popular there but in Melbourne, the lyrics were changed so that it was performed differently to the rest of the world. This was due to Peter Francis of the New South Wales Bush Music Club altering the words and adding a new verse to it to make it a distinctly Australian variation of the original British lyrics. As a result of this, there is sometimes an erroneous assumption in Europe that \\"Beer, Beer, Beer\\" is of Australian origin. When it was published in Sing Out!, only two verses of the song were published. In response, a New Zealand reader of Sing Out! sent the magazine a copy of the new Australian verse to be republished. In the United States, the song was performed there, titled as \\"Charlie Mopps\\" but was noted to have similar titles to other drinking songs such as \\"Champagne Charlie\\" and \\"Willie the Weeper\\" with similar themes of praising alcohol. \\"Beer, Beer, Beer\\" has been recorded a number of times by singers including the Clancy Brothers and Marc Gunn. In the Netherlands, \\"Beer, Beer, Beer\\" was released as a single in 1970 by the Cocktail Trio after the Australian version of the song had been brought to the attention of their manager. The song was also included in the 2004 video game, The Bard's Tale where it is performed by drunken patrons in the first pub in the game. = Charlie Mopps = \\"Beer, Beer, Beer\\" is based around Charlie Mopps (also spelled as Charlie Mops), the fictional inventor of beer. His name is presumed to rhyme with barley and hops, two of the main ingredients in beer. He therefore is praised for his creation in \\"Beer Beer Beer\\". The character has been described in print media relating to \\"Beer, Beer, Beer\\" as \\"one of Mankind's greatest benefactors\\". \\"Beer, Beer, Beer\\" has also been the inspiration for the name of a number of pubs, which have named themselves after Charlie Mopps.

March 1927 The Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique (CGT, and commonly named \\"Transat\\"), typically known overseas as the French Line, was a French shipping company. Established in 1855 by the brothers √âmile and Issac P√©reire under the name Compagnie G√©n√©rale Maritime, the company was entrusted by the French government to transport mails to North America. In 1861, the name of the company was changed to Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique. The company's first vessel, the SS Washington, had its maiden voyage on 15 June 1864. After a period of trials and errors in the late 19th century, the company, under the direction of its presidents Jules Charles-Roux and John Dal Piaz, gained fame in the 1910s and 1930s with its prestigious ocean liners such as SS Paris, , and especially . Fragilized by the Second World War, the company regained its fame in 1962 with the famous SS France, which suffered major competition from air transport and was retired from service in 1974. In 1977, the company merged with the Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes to form the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Maritime. Then, in 1996, the company Compagnie G√©n√©rale Maritime merged to form the CMA CGM. Contrary to what its name suggests, Transat was not content with operating just in the North Atlantic route. It also offered service to Central America and even, for a time, the Pacific coast. From the beginning of the 20th century, it offered crossings between Marseille and Algiers, creating a tourist circuit in North Africa in the 1920s. In the 1930s, the company briefly became involved in aviation through Air France Translatlantique. Other than operating ocean liners, the company also had a significant fleet of freighters. The cargo service was started in the 1900s. The ocean liners of Transat were often symbolic works of art of their time; they were intended to represent an image of France abroad. The quality of services on board, such as that of meals and wines, had attracted wealthy clientele, including Americans at the time of the Prohibition in the United States. Years after the company's demise, its heritage continues to attract collectors and is showcased in exhibitions. History French Line Sailing List 70 - August 10, 1922 In 1855, the P√©reire brothers, Emile and Isaac, created the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Maritime, which later became the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique. They were already the owners of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Cr√©dit Mobilier, which became the main shareholder. Five years later they signed an agreement with the French government. The company contracted to create a fleet and to provide liner service and carry mail for 20 years on the following routes: Le Havre - New York with calls at Brest, Saint-Nazaire, and the Isthmus of Panama, with 3 additional services for Guadeloupe, Cayenne, and Mexico and. In return, the government would provide the company with an annual subsidy. In 1861, Compagnie G√©n√©rale Maritime changed its name to the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique. The Pereire brothers also established a shipyard at Penho√´t, near Saint-Nazaire. The next year the first trip to the West Indies and Mexico was made by the ship Louisiane. Two years later the New York - Le Havre line service was begun, with the paddle-steamer Washington providing postal service. In 1867 the company switched from using paddle wheels to using propellers for its vessels, partly because they were more fuel efficient. An economic and financial crisis in 1868 forced the Pereire brothers to file a petition of bankruptcy and to resign from the company's board. However, the company survived. Technical progress continued and the company modified its vessels to transport more goods. Still, in 1873 the line suffered its first major accident. The Ville du Havre collided with the sailing ship Loch Earn, with a loss of life of about 226 people. Century of Progress International Exposition at Chicago in 1933 In 1879, the French government awarded the company the concession for postal services for the Mediterranean. That same year the company incorporated. Between 1882 and 1884 the government renewed the earlier fleet and postal agreements. In 1886, SS La Bourgogne traveled the le Havre - New York transit in a little more than 7 days. This gave the company first place in the New York postal service, and ignited a competition for the record in the trans-Atlantic run. In 1894 the company offered the first cruise for American passengers when La Touraine initiated service from New York to Constantinople. Between 1897 and 1904, European competition intensified and the company suffered two major maritime disasters. The Ville de Saint-Nazaire had to be abandoned at sea in 1897 and La Bourgogne sank with 568 passengers in 1898. Furthermore, labor strife developed as strikes came to affect all ports and all staff. The strikes continued until 1923. In 1904, Jules Charles-Roux became president and instituted a reorganization. The company re-oriented its strategy to emphasize the quality of life aboard ship rather than racing against time. The next year it initiated Le Havre - New York cargo service. The company did not become a major participant of the trans-Atlantic ocean liner trade until after World War I. During 1907 and 1908, when immigration to the United States was greatest, the company's share of the market was a mere 10%. In line with its strategy, the company did not have ships of either great speed or size, but instead became renowned during the early 20th century for its luxuriously appointed liners. The most notable of these early ships was the SS France, which began service in 1912. During World War I, the company transformed its vessels into warships, hospital vessels and troopships. By the end of the war, the company had lost a third of the fleet. Still, the company recovered during the post-war period, with several famous ships beginning service. In 1927, the SS Ile de France, the first ship to be styled in Art Deco, had its maiden voyage. The company also diversified. In 1919, it introduced the first tourist motor car circuit in North Africa and in 1925 it created the Soci√©t√© des Voyages et H√¥tels Nord-Africains (S.V.H.N.A.). One of the minor vessels of the CGT - the s/s \\"Kentucky\\" - made history of the Polish newly built deep-sea harbour of Gdynia, entering it on Aug. 13, 1923 as the first foreign ship ever to call at Gdynia, still before raising the status of the locality to a town (which occurred on the 10th of Feb. 1926). Advertisement, circa 1937 The Great Depression caused the company to suffer a significant decrease of profits as costs increased and passenger numbers plummeted The company responded by decommissioning vessels and discontinuing unprofitable routes. A generous government subsidy enabled the company, in 1935, to finance the construction its most famous vessel, the SS Normandie. At the time of completion, the ship was the largest in the world and also the fastest, winning the Blue Riband from the Italian liner, the SS Rex. Its Art Deco interior and streamlined hull design were famous. It won the Blue Ribbon trophy for its first voyage with a speed of 30 knots. However, it was never a commercial success and a fire in 1942 ended its career. In 1939-1940, at the beginning of World War II, the company was subject to mobilization of more than a third of the staff. The Department of Shipping & Maritime Transport chartered or requisitioned the company's ships. The company also received 95 vessels to manage for the war effort. By 1946, the loss of several vessels due to the war had diminished the company's fleet, though the company was able to acquire several Liberty ships. The company also acquired Libert√©, the former German liner , which France had claimed as reparations. In 1950, the company acquired the Compagnie g√©n√©rale transsaharienne, which operated land and air transport across the Sahara. Passenger traffic grew post-war, but the advent of commercial jet air travel in 1958 was the beginning of the end for the French Line's passenger ships. Despite the launch of a new flagship, the 66,000 ton SS France in 1961, passenger demand decreased as no ship could match the convenience of airplane flights that could transport passengers in a matter of hours over a distance that by ship would take several days. The ocean liner fleet became dependent on government subsidies, which were finally ended in 1974. The fleet was subsequently hulked. In 1976, the company merged with the Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes de Marseille to form the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Maritime. France was laid up until 1979 when the Norwegian Cruise Line bought it and renamed it Norway. In 2008, Norway was beached at Alang, India, and broken up for scrap.

Jujol's wide field of activity ranged from furniture designs and painting, to architecture. He worked with Antoni Gaud√≠ on many of his most famous works. Among Jujol's projects are Casa Batll√≥, Casa Mil√†, Park G√ºell, and Our Lady of Montserrat, and among his design styles are Modernisme and Art Nouveau. Biography =Early life= Josep Maria Jujol was born in Tarragona where he lived until age 9. He was the son of Andreu Jujol, a school director, and of Teresa Gibert i Vives. He was born on the top floor of the public school, Sant Joan, where his father worked. He began to draw at an early age, and always had an admiration for nature. According to his biography, he would roam the hills of Tarragona and its Roman ruins. They lived at the school for nine years before his father was transferred in 1888 to Carrer Zurbano in Gr√†cia, which is now integrated into the City of Barcelona. =Architecture career= =Barcelona= Casa Planells, in Barcelona, before it was restored Santa Maria del Mar. Casa Batll√≥, his first project with Antoni Gaud√≠. Jujol's father was transferred once again in 1893 to the City of Barcelona. There Jujol began to walk the medieval district, developed an admiration for gothic architecture and began to draft the buildings. The family moved to the Gran Via in the Eixample District of Barcelona, where he experienced modern and modernist buildings. In 1901, he was accepted in the Architectural program in Barcelona. While attending school, he first worked with Antoni Maria Gallissa i Soqu√© (Don Antoni), whom he admired as a person and an architect. His first project was a commission for Don Antoni to decorate the street called Carrer Fenen for the Merc√® Festival (Festes de la Merc√®). Jujol had to create the metal frames and stained glass windows. He continued to work for Don Antoni until 1903. He then began to work in the studio of Josep Font i Gum√†. Where he collaborated with him on the Trinity altar in the Basilica de Santa Maria del Mar. In his spare time he completed plans for an amusement park that was to emulate the solar system. The plan was never revived. =Independent work= In 1906 he received his certificate as an architect and was able to work on his own. One of his first projects was to decorate Don Antoni's entrance stairway with his trademark sgraffito. Jujol became acquainted with Antoni Gaud√≠ through their mutual friend, Dr. Santal√≥. Gaud√≠ soon worked in partnership with Jujol. Their first project together was Casa Batll√≥. It is speculated in Jujol's biography that he had a great influence on Gaud√≠'s use of colour and shapes. However, this is not for certain. In any case, Gaud√≠ had great respect for Jujol's views and entrusted him as a collaborator on his projects for many years. =Death= Jujol died at Barcelona in 1949.

Similarly, isolated hypoaldosteronism is the condition of having lowered aldosterone without corresponding changes in cortisol. (The two hormones are both produced by the adrenals.) Causes There are several causes for this condition, including adrenal insufficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and some medications such as certain diuretics, NSAIDs, and ACE inhibitors. * Primary aldosterone deficiency # Primary adrenal insufficiency # Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (21 but not 11Œ≤ and 17) # Aldosterone synthase deficiency * Secondary aldosterone deficiency # Secondary adrenal insufficiency # Diseases of the pituitary or hypothalamus * Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism (due to decreased angiotensin 2 production as well as intra-adrenal dysfunction) # Renal dysfunction-most commonly diabetic nephropathy # NSAIDs # Ciclosporin Mechanism Hypoaldosteronism may result in high blood potassium and is the cause of 'type 4 renal tubular acidosis', sometimes referred to as hyperkalemic RTA or tubular hyperkalemia. However, the acidosis, if present, is often mild. It can also cause urinary sodium wasting, leading to volume depletion and hypotension. When adrenal insufficiency develops rapidly, the amount of Na+ lost from the extracellular fluid exceeds the amount excreted in the urine, indicating that Na+ also must be entering cells. When the posterior pituitary is intact, salt loss exceeds water loss, and the plasma Na+ falls. However, the plasma volume also is reduced, resulting in hypotension, circulatory insufficiency, and, eventually, fatal shock. These changes can be prevented to a degree by increasing the dietary NaCl intake. Rats survive indefinitely on extra salt alone, but in dogs and most humans, the amount of supplementary salt needed is so large that it is almost impossible to prevent eventual collapse and death unless mineralocorticoid treatment is also instituted. Diagnosis Patients with a suspected diagnosis of Hypoaldosteronism are often screened with simple blood tests. Potassium levels, plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity are the three most useful in the first instance. Low aldosterone levels in the presence of high renin activity, often with low sodium, high potassium, is associated with Primary hypoaldosteronism. Secondary hypoaldersteronism may be suspected if Renin activity is low with low aldosterone concentrations. The plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio is calculated to determine if levels are sufficiently deranged to consider a diagnosis of hypoaldosteronism. If screening test is suggestive, a more definitive diagnosis is made by performing either a saline suppression test, ambulatory salt loading test, or fludrocortisone suppression test. Imaging to detect an Adrenocortical adenoma may also be considered. Treatment * Aldosterone deficiency should be treated with a mineralocorticoid (such as fludrocortisone), as well as possibly a glucocorticoid for cortisol deficiency, if present. * Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism is amenable to fludrocortisone treatment, but the accompanying hypertension and edema can prove a problem in these patients, so often a diuretic (such as the thiazide diuretic, bendrofluazide, or a loop diuretic, such as furosemide) is used to control the hyperkalemia.

He is well known for umpiring in the second ever Test match, played between Australia and England in Melbourne, 1877. Biography Cosstick was born at Croydon, Surrey, England. He was attracted to Victoria by the gold fever of the early 1850s and joined the Melbourne Cricket Club on arrival. There he was employed as a ground bowler, bowling in the nets to the members for hours at a time for a salary of ¬£150 a year. Cosstick was a right-hand batsman and right-arm medium- fast roundarm bowler. He played 18 matches for Victoria from 1860 to 1876. As a batsman he scored 315 runs at an average of 9.84 with a highest score of 36. He took 106 wickets at an average of 9.41, with best figures of 9 for 61. He took five wickets in an innings 11 times, and ten wickets in a match on 5 occasions. He also took 14 catches. In 1869 Cosstick took 6 wickets for 1 run against Tasmania, which is still the cheapest 6-wicket analysis in first-class cricket history. In the match between Eighteen of Victoria and the All-England Eleven led by H. H. Stephenson played at Melbourne in January 1862 ‚Äì the first international match played in Australia ‚Äì Cosstick made 8 and 11, and took 1 wicket for 31 runs for a team that was decisively beaten by an innings in spite of its advantage in numbers. W. G. Grace brought out an English team in the 1873-74 season, and Cosstick‚Äôs bowling, along with the batting of Bransby Cooper and John Conway and the bowling of Frank Allan and Harry Boyle were responsible for the visitors‚Äô defeat by an innings by Eighteen of Victoria. Impressive though the result was, a newspaper correspondent wrote \\"any numbskulls who talk about Eleven Victorian natives playing this Eleven of England are prattling about what they don‚Äôt understand.\\" In Sydney, playing for a Combined Fifteen of Victoria and New South Wales, the crowd urged Cosstick to return to the crease after he was given out. He did so, claiming that the wrong umpire had given him out. With three batsmen at the wicket, Grace led his team from the field until Cosstick abandoned his protest. At the age of 41, Cosstick umpired in the second ever Test match, played between Australia and England in Melbourne on 31 March to 4 April 1877. His colleague was Ben Terry, who was also an English professional at Melbourne Cricket Club. Cosstick died at West Maitland.

Name The river has also been known historically as the South Fork of the Gauley River In Webster County, it collects a short tributary known as the Middle Fork Williams River, which itself collects the North Branch Middle Fork Williams River. The river most likely was named after a landowner named Williams. Geography The Williams River rises in southern Pocahontas County, approximately 5 miles (8 km) west of Marlinton, and flows initially northwardly, then westwardly into southern Webster County, where it joins the Gauley River approximately 2 miles (3 km) southeast of Cowen. It flows for much of its length in the Monongahela National Forest, including the Cranberry Wilderness, in an area that was heavily logged in the early 20th century and has since been reforested. Coal mining activity took place along the river's lower course into the 1970s. Fishing The Williams River is regarded as one of the five best trout fishing streams in West Virginia, due to its cold water temperature, low turbidity, and frequent stockings of trout (amounting to 27,000 pounds annually) by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources.Monongahela National Forest: Williams River Retrieved on March 14, 2013.

He is best known as one of the founders of the cognitive linguistics movement and the creator of cognitive grammar. He has also made significant contributions to the comparative study of Uto-Aztecan languages, publishing several articles on historical Uto-Aztecan linguistics, as well as editing collections of grammar sketches of under-described Uto-Aztecan languages. Life Born in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, Langacker received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1966. From 1966 until 2003, he was professor of linguistics at the University of California, San Diego. From 1997 until 1999 he also served as president of the International Cognitive Linguistics Association. Career Langacker develops the central ideas of cognitive grammar in his seminal, two-volume Foundations of Cognitive Grammar, which became a major departure point for the emerging field of cognitive linguistics. Cognitive grammar treats human languages as consisting solely of semantic units, phonological units, and symbolic units (conventional pairings of phonological and semantic units). Like construction grammar, and unlike many mainstream linguistic theories, cognitive grammar extends the notion of symbolic units to the grammar of languages. Langacker further assumes that linguistic structures are motivated by general cognitive processes. In formulating his theory, he makes extensive use of principles of gestalt psychology and draws analogies between linguistic structure and aspects of visual perception. In 2020, Langacker contributed to the volume, entitled Usage-based Dynamics in Second Language Development to honour Marjolijn Verspoor's work in applied linguistics.

He is also a professor of law, member of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences and, a former judge in the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany (Bundesverfassungsgericht), the highest court in Germany. Career Kirchhof obtained a doctorate at the early age of 25 having studied law in Freiburg and Munich. He then became director of the Institute for Tax Law (Institut f√ºr Steuerrecht) at the University of M√ºnster. In 1987 he was finally appointed to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany in Karlsruhe, where he remained a judge until 1999. He then assumed the position of professor at the University of Heidelberg School of Law. From January until March 2000, with former President Roman Herzog and former Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer, Kirchhof led an independent commission to investigate the CDU donations scandal.Kohl's Party Names Panel in Funds Probe Los Angeles Times, 15 January 2000. During the 2005 federal election campaign, Angela Merkel, leader of the CDU/CSU, announced that Kirchhof would serve as minister of finance if she formed a government. Kirchhof proposed a graduated income tax rate of 15, 20 and 25%. Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der successfully mocked Kirchhof during the SPD's campaign, calling him \\"that professor from Heidelberg\\", implying Kirchhof an ivory-towered point of view. This proposal undermined the CDU's credibility on economic affairs, and led many Germans to believe that the party's platform for deregulation would only benefit the rich. It was a major contribution to the CDU's drop in the polls, from a lead of 21% over the SPD at the start of the election campaign to 9%. Merkel's own popularity dropped 10% when she publicly endorsed Kirchhof's tax proposals. Although Merkel's popularity improved after she later distanced herself from Kirchhof's proposals, the CDU did not recover its earlier large lead in the polls. Kirchof attempted to bring the matter to a close before polling day by indicating that he would be remaining in academia and would not accept a position in government. Kirchhof has very conservative opinions on issues such as family and feminism, although these did not become an issue during the campaign. He has been quoted as saying that \\"the mother's career lies in the family, which doesn't produce power, but friendship, not money, but happiness.\\" After the election of Matteo Renzi as Prime Minister of Italy there has been contact with Paul Kirchhof.

In place of Ravliƒá cave, which is located in Drinovci, were found traces of life dating from the later Neolithic period. The life in these regions has been flowing continuously - the peoples, cultures and civilizations have been changing. In later, but historical times, this soil had very living presence of the Romans, whose commercial road, connecting the two great ancient trading center - Salon and Narona, was passing through the region. Recent archaeological excavations at the site in Gorica confirm that on this soil in ancient times there was a significant Roman settlement. Middle Ages is a time of tombstones - steƒáak and in municipality of Grude can be found practically everywhere - which proves that at that time was quite a big life. Undoubtedly it is a merit favorable geographical position of this region, as well as the relatively mild climate, together with rich natural resources.

The game simulates World War II naval battles near the Solomon Islands and is primarily designed for two players. It uses the same game design as the Smithsonian edition of Midway. Scenarios include the naval battles of the Coral Sea, Guadalcanal, and Santa Cruz. Land combat is abstracted out of the game. Components =Search Boards= The bulk of the game is played out on duplicate boards, one per player, with full knowledge of friendly forces but limited knowledge of the opponent's. Knowledge of opposing forces is gained by air and sea reconnaissance. Various zones required for deployment or victory conditions are noted on the search boards. =Battle Boards= Air-surface and surface-surface battles are held on boards representing a small patch of open ocean. Unit deployments are made at the start of each battle. =Counters= Double-sided cardboard counters with dimensions between 1/2\\" and 3/4\\" represent combat aircraft squadrons, aerial reconnaissance squadrons, capital ships, surface escort squadrons, and transports. Additional counters are used for record keeping, particularly damage and suspected enemy locations. Gameplay =Aircraft Availability= At most, aircraft are available every other turn. After completing a mission, they must spend one turn refuelling and rearming before they can be used again. However, aircraft being fuelled on an aircraft carrier pose an extreme fire hazard if the carrier is attacked, a vulnerability reflected by the rules. Readied aircraft on ground airstrips have no such drawback. =Searching= While not required, aerial reconnaissance is necessary for victory. Dedicated reconnaissance squadrons (and combat squadrons, if necessary) fly circuitous routes across the search board. The controlling player may ask his opponent if ships are present in any space flown over. However, asking about every space flown over tends to reveal to the opponent where the plane originated from. Once ships are encountered, the controlling player may elect to spend extra fuel to refine the search results. Depending on success, the opponent may report simply that \\"ships are present\\", that \\"[up to double the actual number of ships] are present\\", or potentially an exact number of ships by class are present. =Battle= Readied combat air units may be dispatched against any target in range, even if no information beyond \\"ships are present\\" is known. At the start of a battle, the opponent's true force is revealed; however, the attacker may not elect to bring reinforcements or flee with his current force. Game mechanics encourage historic tactics such as fighter cover and multiple-direction assaults. Units may sustain six levels of damage before destruction; however, damage can occur at rates beyond one level of damage per attack. Similarly, land bases may be bombarded. =Multiplayer= While designed primarily for two players, Guadalcanal is an excellent candidate for an umpired multiplayer game. Where possible, allied commanders should have their forces split along historical lines. In these games, the individual search boards are complete only for the forces under an individual player's control. Communication between allied players is limited (and subject to interception) and possibilities for confusion of friendly and opposing forces exist. The umpire serves to mediate all exchange of information and conduct all dice rolls in such games. Expansion Avalon Hill's magazine The General published official expansion scenarios for Guadalcanal and Midway in Volume 28 Issue 5. \\"What-if\\" scenarios are posited for a 1941 carrier engagement off Wake Island and a Japanese assault on the Panama Canal. Both games, plus a counter insert sheet and search board set in the magazine, are required for play.

Located on Spadina Avenue, just south of College Street, the bar has played an important role in the development of popular music in Toronto since the 1940s. It is best known for the 1977 surprise show by The Rolling Stones, which became nationally notorious for the presence of then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's wife, Margaret Trudeau (then Margaret Kemper), who was partying with the Stones.  History  Apocryphally, the original building at 462 Spadina had been a music venue since 1850 and was first used as a haven for escaped slaves. The current building was built in 1910 and housed a dry goods store, a barbershop, and restaurants in its first three decades.\\"A Brief History of the Legendary El Mocambo\\". Torontoist, September 23, 2014. With the passage of the Liquor Licence Act of 1946, which allowed the sale of liquor in taverns and restaurants in the province for the first time since World War I, restaurateurs Joseph Brown and John Lang decided to apply for one of Toronto's first liquor licences and convert their property at 464 Spadina into one of the city's first cocktail bars. The establishment's name and iconic neon palm sign were inspired by a San Francisco nightclub. In the club's original incarnation, which officially opened on March 23, 1948, the main floor was converted into a dining hall with a dance floor on the second floor and featured Latin music. Live music was not permitted until July 1948 when the Liquor Licence Board of Ontario reversed an earlier ban. In later configurations of the establishment musical acts appeared on separate stages located on the main and second floor of the building. By the 1960s, Adam Schuy owned the venue which, by then, featured music appealing to Toronto's Hungarian, Irish, and Portuguese communities. A German dance club, Deutsches Tanz Lokal, frequently rented the second floor during this period. By the time Schuy died in 1971, striptease was being featured on the main floor. The business and building were bought by Michael Baird and restaurateur and former Toronto Argonaut Tom Kristenbrun, who also owned the Jarvis House, in 1972. Under the pair's ownership, the \\"El Mo\\" became a youth-oriented blues and rock music venue and brought bands like Downchild Blues Band, which became the club's house band, as well as Buddy Guy and Muddy Waters and many others \\"up the street\\" and paid them a regular fee to perform. During the early 1970s, the upstairs featured \\"retreads\\" and \\"has-been\\" acts mostly with the occasional group on the rise. Most of the time drink sales determined which bands would return. The bands would start out downstairs and if the revenue they generated increased, they would sometimes graduate on upstairs. Up and coming performers such as Tom Waits and U2 and Elvis Costello performed at the El Mo in the 1970s. The iconic El Mocambo sign Located within walking distance of the University of Toronto, Ryerson University, and George Brown College (which was housed in Kensington Market at the time) the venue became a popular place for students living nearby. Throughout the 1970s the club was known as a bastion of the blues and rock and roll during a time better known for disco. It was considered \\"infamous\\" due to a 1977 surprise performance by the Rolling Stones posing as \\"the Cockroaches\\" an opening act for April Wine.; after which Mick Jagger was rumoured to have had a backstage assignation with Margaret Trudeau, wife of then-Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau. The venue was featured on the Stones' Love You Live concert album. In its heyday, the venue also hosted performances by Blondie, the Ramones, Devo and Joan Jett. Changes in the record industry's touring practices, a failure to update the venue, and a deal with Concert Productions International which prevented other promoters from booking the club, saw fewer international acts performing at the El Mo, which increasingly booked local acts instead. Baird and Kristenbrun sold the club in 1986, initiating a long period of frequent ownership changes and decline including it being padlocked twice in 1989 and brief closures in 1991 and 2001.\\"El Mocambo saved by Dragons‚Äô Den star Michael Wekerle\\". Toronto Star, November 6, 2014.  Later years  The club was a mainstay of the 1990s underground music scene. Dan Burke became the club's booker in 1998 and made it into a venue for garage rock acts and international bands such as White Stripes and Zoobombs. A monthly queer rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll party called Vazaleen, organized by Will Munro, became a regular feature and helped launch Peaches on what became an international career. Herbert Becker and John Paolucci owned and ran the club from 1986 until it closed in 1989. The two purchased the business, the name and logo from Michael Baird and Tom Kristenbrun. In 2001, El Mocambo was bought by Abbas Jahangiri who renovated both floors and tried to turn the upstairs into a dance studio. The club was in this period venue to all genres of music from rock and roll and orchestra to heavy metal, reggae, hip hop and jazz. Jahangiri has become a missionary, and used the club to host numerous charity events with fundraisers have been held for War Child, Amnesty International, Free the Children, World Vision, Blank-Fest and others. In 2012, he sold El Mocambo in order to focus on his missionary work. The new owners had difficulty booking for the venue and put it up for sale in the fall 2014. The club was expected to close after a last show on November 6, 2014, However, on the eve of its impending closure it was announced that the club had been purchased for $3.8 million by Michael Wekerle, who intends to renovate it but maintain it as a live music venue.\\"Dragons‚Äô Den cast member Michael Wekerle buys El Mocambo\\". CityNews, November 6, 2014.  Major acts  Over the years other major music acts appeared at the venue, including Marilyn Monroe, internationally famous jazz performers, including Grover Washington, Jr., Charles Mingus, and Al Di Meola, and rock acts such as U2, Moxy, Elvis Costello, The Ramones, John Cougar Mellencamp, Duran Duran, Dream Theater, The Rolling Stones, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, April Wine, Bo Diddley, Tom Cochrane and Red Rider, Blondie, The Cars, Meat Loaf, Jimi Hendrix, Queens of the Stone Age, Bon Jovi, Teenage Head, Sum 41, Shakin' Natives, Etta Royal and Congress Court. On March 4, 1977, looking for an unprepossessing venue to record in, The Rolling Stones played the first of two performances at the club, billing themselves pseudonymously as \\"The Cockroaches\\". It was their first live club date in 14 years. Their opening act was Canadian rockers April Wine of Montreal. The Stones show was recorded and released as one side (Side 3) of the double album Love You Live, which reached #3 in the UK, #5 in the US. April Wine took advantage of the high-tech remote recording equipment brought by the Stones to record their own show for a live album as well. On May 9, 2008 the acclaimed American hard-rock band Queens of the Stone Age had a surprise concert at El Mocambo as part of their Canadian tour.

Early years Michael Power was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada to Captain William and Mary Roach Power, immigrants from Waterford, Ireland. At the age of twelve he was sent to the Seminary of St. Sulpice, Montreal and completed his training at the Seminary of Quebec. He was ordained a priest on August 19, 1827 in Montreal by Bishop John Dubois of New York.\\"Most Reverend Michael Power\\", Archdiocese of Toronto He served as a missionary priest of the Archdiocese of Qu√©bec and the Diocese of Montr√©al. Father Power was appointed pastor at Drummondville, where he remained until 1831 when he was sent as pastor to Montebello. From 1833 to 1839 he was pastor of Sainte-Martine, near Valleyfield. In 1839 he was appointed Vicar General of Montr√©al. First Bishop of Toronto The diocese was created on December 17, 1841 out of the Diocese of Kingston. Father Power was appointed the first Bishop of the new See, and consecrated in 1842 in Laprairie, Quebec, by Bishop R√©mi Gaulin of Kingston.Nicolson, Murray. \\"Michael Power First Bishop of Toronto\\", CCHA, Historical Studies, 54 (1987), 27-38 Power was the first English-speaking Bishop to be born in Canada. Bishop Power immediately drew up rules for the diocese, which were adopted by the clergy. During the course of his episcopate he had to cope with several unworthy clerics and did not hesitate to threaten and apply harsh punishment. In the autumn of 1842 he asked the general of the Jesuits for men to assume direction of the Indian missions in the western and northern parts of his diocese. They arrived the following July and established their base in Sandwich. Between 1843 and 1845, he visited the various areas of the diocese. In 1844, Power and other Canadian bishops successfully petition the Pope for the creation of an ecclesiastical province in Canada. The dioceses of Quebec, Montreal, Kingston and Toronto were united under the metropolitan Province of Quebec, and Quebec became the Archdiocese. St. Michaels, Toronto On May 8, 1845, Bishop Power laid the cornerstone for St. Michael's Cathedral. In January 1847 Power left on a six- month visit to Europe, seeking to recruit additional priests and to raise money for his cathedral. While in Ireland he arranged for the Sisters of Loreto to establish a mission in Toronto. He also witnessed the famine that was driving unprecedented numbers of Irish to emigrate.Choquette, Robert. \\"Power, Michael\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 7, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003 Death More than 90,000 landed at Quebec in 1847 to escape the Great Famine. Typhus was rife among them and spread to the Canadian towns, including Toronto. Power contracted the disease while calling on some of the victims and succumbed to it on 1 October 1847. He was 42 years of age. Power's remains are buried in a crypt beneath St. Michael's Cathedral. Legacy Michael Power High School, founded in 1957, named after him. A sculpture of Bishop Power, created by John Cochrane, is located at the main entrance the archbishop's residence in Toronto. Bishop Power's most notable achievements were the building of St. Michael's Cathedral, Toronto and the Bishop's Palace on Church Street. Bishop Michael Power as portrayed in the film Death or Canada In 2005, Mark G. McGowan wrote a book called, Michael Power: The Struggle to Build the Catholic Church on the Canadian Frontier. In 2009, Bishop Power was featured prominently in the docudrama Death or Canada, which tells the story of the Irish Famine and its impact on Toronto in 1847. Power is portrayed as the hero of Toronto and is described as a \\"martyr of charity.\\" A contributor to the film, Mark G. McGowan also wrote a book, Death or Canada: The Irish Famine Migration to Toronto, 1847.

Before fronting Underoath, Chamberlain was the vocalist for the band This Runs Through in which his brother, Phil Chamberlain, was the drummer (who is also the drummer for To Speak of Wolves). Background Spencer Chamberlain was born in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina, with his mother, and older brother, Phil (also a musician as the drummer for Sullivan and To Speak of Wolves). As a child, Chamberlain's family was well to do and had enough money to pay tuition at Greensboro Day School. Chamberlain's parents divorced when he was in elementary school at Greensboro Day School. Chamberlain also struggled with drug and alcohol abuse. He tells Alternative Press, \\"You know how some people have a good family or a girlfriend that's always there for them and never fails? That was [what] drugs [were] for me. That was my weakness.\\" He particularly had problems with a serious addiction to cocaine. Chamberlain soon went on to Page High School. Shortly after graduating high school, he moved to Florida. He continued to struggle, until his step brother, a pastor, introduced him to Christianity. Although Chamberlain hadn't grown up in a Christian home and avoided religion most of his childhood, he claims it is half of what saved him, the other being music. However in a 2018 interview, Chamberlain stated, \\"I'm not saying religion is wrong for everyone, but for me it was wrong. It ruined my life, turned me into a drug addict and people were awful to me the whole time. I never felt more alone in my life than when I was Christian.\\" Music Before Chamberlain joined Underoath, he was in a band based out of Greensboro, North Carolina called, NINE DOWN and This Runs Through. They released a five-song EP, Until Forever Finds Me. Chamberlain at 2006's Warped Tour. In late 2003, former lead vocalist of Underoath, Dallas Taylor (currently the vocalist for Maylene and the Sons of Disaster), left the band. Later in October of that same year at the CMJ Fest, Chamberlain took the stage as the new lead vocalist. During the early months of 2004, the band recorded their first album with Chamberlain and their second record for Solid State Records. Chamberlain has released five albums with Underoath, They're Only Chasing Safety (2004), Define the Great Line (2006), Lost in the Sound of Separation (2008), √ò (2010), and Erase Me (2018). When Define the Great Line was released on June 20, 2006, it sold 98,004 copies within its first week and debuted on the Billboard 200 Chart at No. 2. After They're Only Chasing Safety, Chamberlain worked with Melissa Cross to add deeper screaming into the mix. Chamberlain then noted that his vocals on Define The Great Line sound less like imitations of Dallas Taylor's vocals, and more similar to the vocals that he used in his previous band, This Runs Through. His evolved vocals came with the help of Melissa Cross, who coached Chamberlain and refined his \\"growl\\". Alternative Press noted, \\"his bellow [is] more carnal and guttural, [and] his high end more tuneful than whiny. Now when Chamberlain's relating those things that eat at the edges of his conscience and his soul, he has the kind of multi-faceted caterwaul to convey that despair.\\" The article also comments on his songwriting, saying that it \\"reaches inward, confronting every ugly crevice of his being, often emerging from the clash furious and disoriented, but hopeful.\\" In 2010, Chamberlain made a guest appearance on the track \\"Quercus Alba\\" by To Speak of Wolves. The song is included on their debut album Myself < Letting Go. Chamberlain's brother, Phil, is the drummer for the band. In 2013, Underoath played their final tour before disbanding, though Chamberlain implied that he himself would pursue further musical endeavors. Later in the year, Chamberlain announced his new band Sleepwave, along with plans for a debut single, \\"Rock and Roll is Dead and So Am I\\". In July 2014, it was announced that their debut album, Broken Compass, is to be released on September 16, 2014 via Epitaph Records which features their debut single, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". In 2016, Underoath regrouped for a series of shows dubbed 'Rebirth' playing 'They're Only Chasing Safety' and 'Define the Great Line' in full. They have since toured supporting Bring Me the Horizon. On February 22, 2018, Underoath announced their eighth studio album, Erase Me, would be released on April 6, 2018; their first album in 8 years and their first in 10 years with founding drummer Aaron Gillespie.

Roger McGuinn), and David Crosby. It was first released as a single on March 14, 1966. Musically influenced by Ravi Shankar and John Coltrane, the song was influential in developing the musical styles of psychedelic rock, raga rock, and psychedelic pop. Accordingly, critics often cite \\"Eight Miles High\\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song, as well as a classic of the counterculture era. The song was subject to a U.S. radio ban shortly after its release, following allegations published in the broadcasting trade journal the Gavin Report regarding perceived drug connotations in its lyrics. The band strenuously denied these allegations at the time, but in later years both Clark and Crosby admitted that the song was at least partly inspired by their own drug use. The failure of \\"Eight Miles High\\" to reach the Billboard Top 10 is usually attributed to the broadcasting ban, but some commentators have suggested the song's complexity and uncommercial nature were greater factors. \\"Eight Miles High\\" reached number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 24 in the UK Singles Chart. The song was also included on the band's third album, Fifth Dimension, which was released on July 18, 1966. \\"Eight Miles High\\" became the Byrds' third and final U.S. Top 20 hit, and was their last release before the departure of Clark, who was the band's principal songwriter at the time.  History  = Composition = The song's lyrics are, for the most part, about the group's flight to London in August 1965 and their accompanying English tour, as hinted at by the opening couplet: \\"Eight miles high and when you touch down, you'll find that it's stranger than known.\\" Although commercial airliners fly at an altitude of six to seven miles, it was felt that \\"eight miles high\\" sounded more poetic than six and also alluded to the title of the Beatles' song \\"Eight Days a Week\\". According to Clark, the lyrics were primarily his creation, with a minor contribution being Crosby's line, \\"Rain grey town, known for its sound\\"‚Äîa reference to London as home to the British Invasion, which was then dominating the U.S. music charts. Other lyrics in the song that explicitly refer to the Byrds' stay in England include the couplet: \\"Nowhere is there warmth to be found/Among those afraid of losing their ground\\", which is a reference to the hostile reaction of the UK music press and to the English group the Birds serving the band with a writ of copyright infringement because of the similarities in their names. In addition, \\"Round the squares, huddled in storms/Some laughing, some just shapeless forms\\" describes fans waiting for the band outside hotels, while the line \\"Sidewalk scenes and black limousines\\" refers to the excited crowds that jostled the band as they exited their chauffeur-driven cars. Although the basic idea for the song had been discussed during the band's flight to England, it did not begin to take shape until the Byrds' November 1965 tour of the U.S. To alleviate the boredom of traveling from show to show during the tour, Crosby had brought along cassette recordings of Ravi Shankar's music and the John Coltrane albums Impressions and Africa/Brass, which were on constant rotation on the tour bus. The impact of these recordings on the band would manifest itself in the music of \\"Eight Miles High\\" and its B-side \\"Why\\"‚Äîboth of which were influential in the development of the musical styles of psychedelic rock, raga rock, and psychedelic pop. Clark began writing the song's lyrics on November 24, 1965, when he scribbled down some rough ideas for later development, after a discussion with guitarist Brian Jones, before the Byrds made a concert appearance supporting the Rolling Stones. Over the following days, Clark expanded this fragment into a full poem, eventually setting the words to music and giving them a melody. Clark then showed the song to McGuinn and Crosby. McGuinn suggested that the song be arranged to incorporate Coltrane's influence. Since Clark's death, however, McGuinn has contended it was he who conceived the initial idea of writing a song about an airplane ride and that he and Crosby both contributed lyrics to Clark's unfinished draft. In his book, Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark, author John Einarson disputes this claim and ponders whether McGuinn's story would be the same if Clark was still alive. = Recording = The master recording of \\"Eight Miles High\\" was recorded on January 24 and 25, 1966, at Columbia Studios in Hollywood. Record producer Allen Stanton guided the band through the recording process. John Einarson has commented that the influence of Coltrane's saxophone playing and, in particular his song \\"India\\" from the Impressions album, can be heard clearly in \\"Eight Miles High\\"‚Äîmost noticeably in McGuinn's recurring twelve-string guitar solo. In addition to this striking guitar motif, the song is also highlighted by Chris Hillman's driving and hypnotic bass line, Crosby's chunky rhythm guitar playing and the band's ethereal harmonies. \\"Eight Miles High\\" also exhibits the influence of sitarist Ravi Shankar, particularly in the droning quality of the song's vocal melody and in McGuinn's guitar playing. However, the song does not actually feature the sound of the sitar, despite the Byrds having appeared brandishing the instrument at a contemporary press conference held to promote the single. In a 1966 promotional interview, which was added to the expanded CD reissue of the Fifth Dimension album, Crosby said that the song's ending made him \\"feel like a plane landing.\\" An earlier version of \\"Eight Miles High\\" was recorded with Al Schmitt at RCA Studios in Los Angeles on December 22, 1965, but Columbia Records refused to release that recording because it had not been produced at a Columbia-owned studio.The Byrds: how we made Eight Miles High The Guardian, September 16, 2014 McGuinn has since said he believes this original version of the song to be more spontaneous sounding than the better known Columbia release. That opinion was echoed by Crosby, who commented, \\"It was a stunner, it was better, it was stronger. It had more flow to it. It was the way we wanted it to be.\\" This original version of \\"Eight Miles High\\" was eventually released on the 1987 archival album Never Before and was also included as a bonus track on the 1996 Columbia/Legacy CD reissue of Fifth Dimension.  Release and legacy  =U.S. radio ban= \\"Eight Miles High\\" was released on March 14, 1966, in the U.S. and May 29, 1966, in the UK, reaching number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 24 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was also included on the band's third album, Fifth Dimension, which was released on July 18, 1966. Following its release, the band faced allegations of advocating the use of recreational drugs in Bill Gavin's Record Report, a weekly newsletter circulated to U.S. radio stations. This resulted in \\"Eight Miles High\\" being banned in a number of states within a week of the report being published, a factor which contributed to the single's failure to break into the Billboard Top 10. The Byrds and their publicist, Derek Taylor, countered by strenuously denying that the song was drug-related. Taylor issued an indignant press release stating unequivocally that the song was about the band's trip to England and not drug use. However, by the early 1980s, both Crosby and Clark were prepared to admit the song was not entirely as innocent as they had originally declared. Crosby said: \\"Of course it was a drug song! We were stoned when we wrote it.\\" Clark was less blunt, explaining in an interview that \\"it was about a lot of things. It was about the airplane trip to England, it was about drugs, it was about all that. A piece of poetry of that nature is not limited to having it have to be just about airplanes or having it have to be just about drugs. It was inclusive because during those days the new experimenting with all the drugs was a very vogue thing to do.\\" Research analyst Mark Teehan, writing for Popular Musicology Online, has challenged the widely held view among critics, music historians and the Byrds themselves that the U.S. radio ban hurt sales of \\"Eight Miles High\\". He points out that although the Gavin Report recommended that radio stations withdraw the single from airplay, many stations did not comply with this suggestion. In addition, he notes that the radio ban was not suggested by the Gavin Report until April 29, 1966, almost seven weeks after the single had been released‚Äîample time for it to have made its mark on the charts. Teehan has uncovered evidence showing \\"Eight Miles High\\" was already decelerating on the national charts before the end of April 1966.Having examined the local music surveys and the Billboard regional retail sales charts as they relate to the national charting of \\"Eight Miles High\\", Teehan found that the progressive, complex and uncommercial nature of the song was a much bigger factor in its failure to reach the Billboard Top 10. Commercial radio stations were reluctant to play songs that were over two-and-a-half minutes long during the mid-1960s, and the song suffered from uncoordinated and inefficient promotion by Columbia Records. Teehan's research revealed that \\"Eight Miles High\\" failed to reach the Top Five in any of his 23 sample regional markets, and most telling, among the thirty radio stations included within this sample, it reached the Top 10 on only seven of them (23%). =Influence and reception= The Byrds at the \\"Eight Miles High\\" press conference in March 1966, posing with a sitar in order to illustrate the Indian influences present in the song. The song's use of Indian and free-form jazz influences, along with its impressionistic lyrics, were immediately influential on the emerging genre of psychedelic rock. Accordingly, some authors and music historians, including Eric V. D. Luft, Domenic Priore, and Dwight Rounds, have described \\"Eight Miles High\\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song. In his book Riot On Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in Hollywood, Priore cites the song as the one that kicked off the psychedelic craze, explaining \\"prior to 'Eight Miles High,' there were no pop records with incessant, hypnotic basslines juxtaposed by droning, trance-induced improvisational guitar.\\" The song was responsible for the naming of the musical subgenre raga rock, when journalist Sally Kempton, in her review of the single for The Village Voice, used the term to describe the record's experimental fusion of eastern and western music. However, although Kempton was the first person to use the term raga rock in print, she actually borrowed the phrase from the promotional material the Byrds' press office had supplied to accompany the \\"Eight Miles High\\" single release. In a 1968 interview for the Pop Chronicles radio documentary, McGuinn denied that the song was an example of raga rock, while Crosby, speaking in 1998, dismissed the term entirely, saying \\"they kept trying to label us; every time we turned around, they came up with a new one ... it's a bunch of bullshit.\\" Nonetheless, the experimental nature of the song placed the Byrds firmly at the forefront of the burgeoning psychedelic movement, along with the Yardbirds, the Beatles, Donovan and the Rolling Stones, who were all exploring similar musical territory concurrently. Contemporary reviews for the single were mostly positive, with Billboard magazine describing the song as a \\"Big beat rhythm rocker with soft lyric ballad vocal and off-beat instrumental backing.\\" Record World magazine also praised the song, commenting \\"It's an eerie tune with lyrics bound to hypnotize. Will climb heights.\\" In the UK, Music Echo described the song as \\"wild and oriental but still beaty\\". The publication also suggested that with the release of \\"Eight Miles High\\" the Byrds had jumped ahead of the Beatles in terms of creativity, saying \\"[By] getting their single out now they've beaten the Beatles to the punch, for Paul [McCartney] admitted recently that the Liverpool foursome are working on a similar sound for their new album and single.\\" In recent years, Richie Unterberger, writing for the Allmusic website, has described \\"Eight Miles High\\" as \\"one of the greatest singles of the '60s.\\" Critics often cite \\"Eight Miles High\\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song, as well as a classic of the counterculture era. In 1999, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, an honor reserved for \\"recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance that are at least 25 years old.\\" In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked \\"Eight Miles High\\" at number 151 on their list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and in March 2005, Q magazine placed the song at number 50 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  Post-release  During the same month that \\"Eight Miles High\\" was released as a single, the Byrds' primary songwriter, Gene Clark, left the band. His fear of flying was given as the official reason for his departure, but other factors, including his tendency toward anxiety and paranoia, as well as his increasing isolation within the group, were also at work. Following the release of \\"Eight Miles High\\" and Clark's departure, the Byrds never again managed to place a single in the Billboard Top 20. The Byrds performed \\"Eight Miles High\\" on a number of television programs during the 1960s and 1970s, including Popside, Drop In, Midweek, and Beat-Club. The song became a staple of the band's live concert repertoire until their final disbandment in 1973. A sixteen-minute live version of \\"Eight Miles High\\" was included on the Byrds' (Untitled) album in 1970, and another live version was released as part of the 2008 album, Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971. The song was performed by a reformed lineup of the Byrds featuring Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, and Chris Hillman in January 1989. The song remained a favorite of Clark's during his post-Byrds solo career and he often performed it at his concert appearances until his death, in 1991. McGuinn also continues to perform an intricate acoustic guitar rendition of the song at his concerts. Crosby has revisited \\"Eight Miles High\\" infrequently during his post-Byrds career, but it was performed during Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's reunion tour of 2000, with Neil Young handling McGuinn's guitar solo, while the other three members sang the song's three-part harmonies. The Byrds' bass player, Chris Hillman, also recorded an acoustic version of \\"Eight Miles High\\" as part of his 2005 album, The Other Side. In addition to its appearance on the Fifth Dimension album, \\"Eight Miles High\\" also appears on several Byrds' compilations, including: The Byrds' Greatest Hits, History of The Byrds, The Original Singles: 1965‚Äì1967, Volume 1, The Byrds, The Very Best of The Byrds, The Essential Byrds and There Is a Season.  Cover versions and media references  \\"Eight Miles High\\" has been covered by many different bands and artists including: the Ventures, Leathercoated Minds, East of Eden, Lighthouse, Leo Kottke, Roxy Music, Ride, Stewart/Gaskin, Robyn Hitchcock, Rockfour, Les Fradkin, The Kennedys, the Postmarks and Steve Hunter. H√ºsker D√º also released the song as a single prior to the release of their Zen Arcade LP in 1984. The song was also covered in 1969 by Golden Earring, who included a nineteen-minute version on their Eight Miles High album. The Emerson, Lake & Palmer spinoff group 3 recorded the song with revised lyrics on their 1988 album, To the Power of Three. Crowded House with Roger McGuinn also covered the song on their I Feel Possessed EP. Don McLean's song \\"American Pie\\" makes reference to \\"Eight Miles High\\" with the lines \\"The Birds flew off with a fall-out shelter / Eight miles high and falling fast.\\" The First Edition's 1968 hit, \\"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)\\", contains a reference to the song with the line \\"I tripped on a cloud and fell a-eight miles high.\\" The independent rock band Okkervil River references \\"Eight Miles High\\" in its song \\"Plus Ones\\", on the 2007 album The Stage Names.

His family emigrated to New York when he was a very young child. He displayed musical talent as a youngster and, at 16, he entered the Institute of Musical Art, now known as Juilliard School. During World War I, he was stationed at Governor‚Äôs Island, where he played clarinet in a military band. Transferred south, Wolfe made his first direct contact with African-American music. He was fascinated with the genre and did extensive research on the history of black folk songs and spirituals. He became inspired to write his own music based on the style. His spirituals and ‚Äúwork songs‚Äù became very popular in sheet music form in the early 1930s. In 1934 Wolfe collaborated with poet Langston Hughes to write \\"Sad Song in de Air,\\" published by Robbins Music Corp. Jacques Wolfe is credited with writing \\"Short'nin' Bread\\" in 1928. The song is a vaudeville \\"blackface\\" song written for stage during blackface shows. The music was published by Harold Flammer and distributed by G. Schirmer in New York City. Also set \\"Three Negro Poems\\" by Clement Wood to music for \\"medium or low voice and piano\\". Published in 1928 by G. Schirmer, the three songs are entitled: \\"Debil-Foot\\", \\"De Glory Road\\" and \\"Gwine to Hebb'n\\". \\"De Glory Road\\" appears dedicated to Paul Robeson. Wolfe wrote the music for the 1931 film The Prodigal and in 1938, composed the music for a Broadway musical based on Roark Bradford‚Äôs John Henry, starring Paul Robeson in the title role. The musical opened in January 1940 and, some reviewers thought because of a weak script, closed five days later.

He was born near East Bend, North Carolina. Shore graduated from Guilford College in 1913. Along with Babe Ruth, he was sold by the Baltimore Orioles to the Red Sox. Shore's best year with the Red Sox was 1915, when he won 18, lost 8 and compiled a 1.64 earned run average. He was 3‚Äì1 in World Series action in 1915 and 1916, with a 1.82 earned run average in 34.2 innings pitched. He missed the Red Sox World Championship season, having enlisted in the military in that war year. His most famous game occurred on June 23, 1917, against the Washington Senators in the first game of a doubleheader at Fenway Park. George Herman \\"Babe\\" Ruth started the game, walking the first batter, Ray Morgan. As newspaper accounts of the time relate, the short-fused Ruth then engaged in a heated argument with apparently equally short-fused home plate umpire Brick Owens. Owens tossed Ruth out of the game, and the even more enraged Ruth then slugged the umpire a glancing blow before being escorted off the field by a policeman; the catcher, Pinch Thomas, was also ejected. Shore was brought in to pitch, coming in with very few warmup pitches. With a new pitcher and catcher, runner Morgan tried to steal and was thrown out, after which Shore then proceeded to retire the remaining 26 Senators without allowing a baserunner, earning a 4‚Äì0 Red Sox win. For many years the game was listed in record books as a \\"perfect game\\", though now, officially, it is scored as a combined no-hitter. Following the game, Ruth paid a $100 fine, was suspended for ten games, and issued a public apology for his behavior. After that season, Shore was sold to the New York Yankees by Red Sox owner Harry Frazee, where he closed out his career in 1920. Shore was sheriff of Forsyth County, North Carolina for many years, and led the 1950s effort to build a minor league baseball park in Winston-Salem, a park that was ultimately named for him and is the home of the Wake Forest University baseball team. He died on September 24, 1980, aged 89, the last surviving member of the 1915 and 1916 World Champion Boston Red Sox.

The design, operation and maintenance is usually done by government agencies, typically on the local level, but may occasionally be contracted out to a park conservancy, friends of group, or private sector company. Common features of municipal parks include playgrounds, gardens, hiking, running and fitness trails or paths, bridle paths, sports fields and courts, public restrooms, boat ramps, and/or picnic facilities, depending on the budget and natural features available. Park advocates claim that having parks near urban residents, including within a 10-minute walk, provide multiple benefits. History A park is an area of open space provided for recreational use, usually owned and maintained by a local government. Grass is typically kept short to discourage insect pests and to allow for the enjoyment of picnics and sporting activities. Trees are chosen for their beauty and to provide shade, with an increasing emphasis on reducing an urban heat island effect. Some early parks include the La Alameda de H√©rcules, in Seville, a promenaded public mall, urban garden and park built in 1574, within the historic center of Seville. The V√°rosliget (City Park) in the City of Pest, what is today Budapest, Hungary, was a city property when afforestation started in the middle of the 18th century, from the 1790s with the clear aim to create a public park. Between 1799 and 1805 it was rented out to the Batthy√°ny family to carry out such a project but the city had eventually taken back control and in 1813 announced a design competition to finally finish the park; works started in 1816. Green Park and St James Park in London, c.1833 An early purpose-built public park, although financed privately, was Princes Park in the Liverpool suburb of Toxteth. This was laid out to the designs of Joseph Paxton from 1842 and opened in 1843. The land on which the park was built was purchased by Richard Vaughan Yates, an iron merchant and philanthropist, in 1841 for ¬£50,000. The creation of Princes Park showed great foresight and introduced a number of highly influential ideas. First and foremost was the provision of open space for the benefit of townspeople and local residents within an area that was being rapidly built up. Secondly it took the concept of the designed landscape as a setting for the suburban domicile (an idea pioneered by John Nash at Regent's Park in London) and re-fashioned it for the provincial town in a most original way. Nash's remodelling of St James's Park from 1827 and the sequence of processional routes he created to link The Mall with Regent's Park completely transformed the appearance of London's West End. With the establishment of Princes Park in 1842, Joseph Paxton did something similar for the benefit of a provincial town, albeit one of international stature by virtue of its flourishing mercantile sector. Liverpool had a burgeoning presence in global maritime trade before 1800, and during the Victorian era its wealth rivalled that of London itself. The form and layout of Paxton's ornamental grounds, structured about an informal lake within the confines of a serpentine carriageway, put in place the essential elements of his much-imitated design for Birkenhead Park in Birkenhead. The latter commenced in 1843 with the help of public finance and deployed the ideas which Paxton had pioneered at Princes Park on a more expansive scale. Frederick Law Olmsted visited Birkenhead Park in 1850 and praised its qualities. Indeed, Paxton is widely credited as having been one of the principal influences on Olmsted and Calvert's design for New York's Central Park of 1857. Another early public park, the Peel Park, Salford, England, opened on 22 August 1846.Salford City Council: Parks in Broughton and Blackfriars Retrieved on 2008-09-03Papillon Graphics' Virtual Encyclopaedia of Greater Manchester: The Campaign for City Parks in Manchester and Salford Retrieved on 2008-09-06University of Salford: Peel Park Retrieved on 2008-09-07 =United States= The predecessors to urban parks in the United States were rural cemeteries. The cemeteries were intended as civic institutions designed for public use. Before the widespread development of public parks, the rural cemetery provided a place for the general public to enjoy outdoor recreation amidst art and sculpture previously available only for the wealthy.Douglas, Ann, The Feminization of American Culture, 1977, New York, Alfred A. Knopf, pp. 208-213. A concert in Chicago's Lincoln Park circa 1907. In The Politics of Park Design: A History of Urban Parks in America, (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1982), Professor Galen Cranz identifies four phases of park design in the U.S. In the late 19th century, city governments purchased large tracts of land on the outskirts of cities to form \\"pleasure grounds\\": semi-open, charmingly landscaped areas whose primary purpose was to allow city residents, especially the workers, to relax in nature. As time passed and the urban area grew around the parks, land in these parks was used for other purposes, such as zoos, golf courses and museums. These parks continue to draw visitors from around the region and are considered regional parks, because they require a higher level of management than smaller local parks. According to the Trust for Public Land, the three most visited municipal parks in the United States are Central Park in New York, Lincoln Park in Chicago, Mission Bay Park in San Diego. In the early 1900s, according to Cranz, U.S. cities built neighborhood parks with swimming pools, playgrounds and civic buildings, with the intention of Americanizing the immigrant residents. In the 1950s, when money became available after World War II, new parks continued to focus on both outdoor and indoor recreation with services, such as sports leagues using their ball fields and gymnasia. These smaller parks were built in residential neighborhoods, and tried to serve all residents with programs for seniors, adults, teens and children. Green space was of secondary importance. As urban land prices climbed, new urban parks in the 1960s and after have been mainly pocket parks. One example of a pocket park is Chess Park in Glendale, California. The American Society of Landscape Architects gave this park a General Design Award of Honor in 2006. These small parks provide greenery, a place to sit outdoors, and often a playground for children. All four types of park continue to exist in urban areas. Because of the large amount of open space and natural habitat in the former pleasure grounds, they now serve as important wildlife refuges, and often provide the only opportunity for urban residents to hike or picnic in a semi-wild area. However, city managers or politicians can target these parks as sources of free land for other uses. Partly for this reason, some of these large parks have \\"friends of X park\\" advisory boards that help protect and maintain their semi-wild nature. = United Kingdom = There are around estimated 27,000 public parks in the UK, with around 2.6 billion visits to parks each year. Many parks are of cultural and historical interest, with 300 registered by Historic England as of national importance. Most public parks have been provided and run by local authorities over the past hundred and seventy years, but these authorities have no statutory duty to fund or maintain these public parks. In 2016 the Heritage Lottery Fund‚Äôs State of UK Public Parks reported that ‚Äú92 per cent of park managers report their maintenance budgets have reduced in the past three years and 95 per cent expect their funding will continue to reduce‚Äù. Uses Millennium Park is an urban park in Chicago that is partitioned into areas with various special uses Parks can be divided into active and passive recreation areas. Active recreation is that which has an urban character and requires intensive development. It often involves cooperative or team activity, including playgrounds, ball fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and skateparks. Active recreation such as team sports, due to the need to provide substantial space to congregate, typically involves intensive management, maintenance, and high costs. Passive recreation, also called \\"low intensity recreation\\" is that which emphasizes the open-space aspect of a park and allows for the preservation of natural habitat. It usually involves a low level of development, such as rustic picnic areas, benches and trails. Passive recreation typically requires little management and can be provided at very low costs. Some open space managers provide nothing other than trails for physical activity in the form of walking, running, horse riding, mountain biking, snow shoeing, or cross-country skiing; or sedentary activity such as observing nature, bird watching, painting, photography, or picnicking. Limiting park or open space use to passive recreation over all or a portion of the park's area eliminates or reduces the burden of managing active recreation facilities and developed infrastructure. Many ski resorts combine active recreation facilities (ski lifts, gondolas, terrain parks, downhill runs, and lodges) with passive recreation facilities (cross-country ski trails). Many smaller neighborhood parks are receiving increased attention and valuation as significant community assets and places of refuge in heavily populated urban areas. Neighborhood groups around the world are joining together to support local parks that have suffered from urban decay and government neglect. A linear park is a park that has a much greater length than width. A typical example of a linear park is a section of a former railway that has been converted into a park called a rail trail or greenway (i.e. the tracks removed, vegetation allowed to grow back). Some examples of linear parks in North America include New York's High Line and the Village of Yorkville Park in Toronto, which won an award from the American Society of Landscape Architects. Parks are sometimes made out of oddly shaped areas of land, much like the vacant lots that often become city neighborhood parks. Linked parks may form a greenbelt. There is a form of urban park in the UK (officially called a \\"recreation ground\\", but commonly called a \\"rec\\" by the public.) and some EU states that have mostly recreation grounds for kids to play with in a park, but have a may duck pond (occasionally), large grassy zones not meant exclusively for sports, many trees and or several bushy places. When it occurs as a separate facility on its own, without any park land, at a street corner or by a shop, the play facility is called a playground.

Its headquarters is in the Near Northwest district of Houston, Texas. The original location was founded in 1947 in San Antonio, Texas by Robert Luby (1910‚Äì1998). Its Fuddruckers restaurants include 49 company-operated restaurants and 107 franchises across the United States with two in Saskatchewan, Canada, two in M√©rida, Mexico, and three in Panama City, Panama. Luby's Culinary Services provides contract food service management to eighteen healthcare, higher education, and corporate dining locations, such as Texas Children's Hospital, Lone Star College, and formerly, Baylor College of Medicine, which ended its relationship with Luby's in March 2015. History Luby's headquarters in Near Northwest and in Houston, 2011. Bob Luby was one year old when his father, Harry, opened his first cafeteria called the New England Dairy Lunch. Bob opened his first Luby's Cafeteria in 1947, focusing on fresh food and customer service. Luby's soon expanded outside of San Antonio to Tyler, Harlingen, El Paso, and Beaumont. In 1959, the original partners formed Cafeterias, Inc. Luby's continued to expand, entering other Texas cities and locations in contiguous states. Luby's entered Houston for the first time when it opened Romana Cafeteria in 1965. Locations opened in New Mexico in 1966 and in Oklahoma in 1980. In 1973, Cafeterias, Inc. became a publicly traded company. To honor Bob Luby, Cafeterias, Inc., was renamed Luby's Cafeterias, Inc., in 1981. One year later, Luby's shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange. By 1987 Luby's had reached 100 locations. The company operated in 11 states in 1996, having over 200 restaurants at that time. In 2001, Chris and Harris Pappas of Houston's Pappas Restaurants (owners of Pappasito's Cantina, Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen, etc.) joined the Luby's management team. Three years later, Luby's moved its corporate headquarters from San Antonio to Houston. The addition of the Pappas management team saw several Luby's restaurants begin to transition from traditional cafeteria-style establishments to hybrid cafeteria/fine dining. Luby's celebrated its 60th anniversary in December 2006 with publishing ‚ÄúLuby‚Äôs Recipes & Memories: A Collection of our Favorite Dishes and Heartwarming Stories\\". In 2008, Luby's published a special edition of the cookbook that included 12 additional recipes.

On June 13, 2011, Luby's opened its first company-owned Fuddruckers restaurant in downtown Houston's seven-mile (11 km) tunnel system. In 2013, Luby's acquired Cheeseburger in Paradise. There were 93 Luby's in August 2015, and this declined to 78 in 2019. Technomic consumer insights senior manager Robert Byrne stated that the fast casual restaurants reduced Luby's market share. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Luby's Inc furloughed more than half of its corporate staff and cut the pay of remaining salaried employees by 50 percent. Luby's Inc also applied for and received a loan of US$10 million as part of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). =Closure and dissolution= On June 3, 2020, Luby's Board of Directors announced plans to sell all its operating divisions and assets, including real estate assets. This decision was influenced in part by circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Net proceeds from transactions will benefit Luby's stockholders. The company did not have a definitive timeline for future transactions, but expected to eventually wind down remaining operations. On September 8, 2020, Luby's further announced it has adopted a plan to liquidate all of its existing assets, as opposed to operating in the current form or merely selling off divisions. As of September 11, 2020, there was 80 Luby's and Fuddruckers still in operation.

Gandhism is a body of ideas that describes the inspiration, vision, and the life work of Mohandas Gandhi. It is particularly associated with his contributions to the idea of nonviolent resistance, sometimes also called civil resistance. The two pillars of Gandhism are truth and nonviolence. The term \\"Gandhism\\" also encompasses what Gandhi's ideas, words, and actions mean to people around the world and how they used them for guidance in building their own future. Gandhism also permeates into the realm of the individual human being, non-political and non-social. A Gandhian can mean either an individual who follows, or a specific philosophy which is attributed to, Gandhism. However, Gandhi did not approve of the term 'Gandhism'. As he explained: In the absence of a \\"Gandhism\\" approved by Gandhi himself, there is a school of thought that one has to derive what Gandhism stands for, from his life and works. One such deduction is a philosophy based on \\"truth\\" and \\"non-violence\\" in the following sense. First, we should acknowledge and accept the truth that people are different at all levels (\\"truth\\"). Second, that one should never resort to violence to settle inherent differences between human beings at any level: from between two people to two nations to two races or two religions (\\"non-violence\\"). Antecedents Although Gandhi's thought is unique in its own right, it is not without ideological parents. Gandhi has in his own writings specified the inspiration for his saying certain things. It can be said that it is his exposure to the West, during his time in London, that compelled him to look at his position on various religious, social, and political affairs. Soon after his arrival in London, he came under the influence of Henry Stephens Salt, who was not yet the famous campaigner and social reformer that he would later become. Salt's first work, A plea for vegetarianism turned Gandhi towards the question of vegetarianism and food habits. It was also around this time that Gandhi joined vegetarian societies in London. Salt eventually became Gandhi's friend too. Talking of the significance of Salt's work, historian Ramachandra Guha said in his work Gandhi before India: \\"For our visiting Indian, however, the Vegetarian Society was a shelter that saved him. The young Gandhi had little interest in the two great popular passions of late nineteenth-century London, the theatre and sport. Imperial and socialist politics left him cold. However, in the weekly meetings of the vegetarians of London he found a cause, and his first English friends.\\" Salt's work allowed Gandhi for the first time to take part in collective action. Salt later went on to write a biography of Henry David Thoreau, who had a profound impact on Gandhi. Although Walden could as well have moved Gandhi, it was Civil Disobedience (Thoreau) that was of greater importance. Gandhi was already in the midst of a form of civil disobedience in South Africa when he read Thoreau. Not only did he adopt the name for the kind of struggle that he would become a champion of, but also adopted the means of breaking laws in order to call for their reform. In 1907, Thoreau's name first appeared in the journal that Gandhi was then editing, Indian Opinion where Gandhi called Thoreau's logic 'incisive' and 'unanswerable'. Gandhi's residence in South Africa itself sought inspiration from another Western literary figure - Leo Tolstoy. Leo Tolstoy's critique of institutional Christianity and faith in the love of the spirit greatly moved him. He would after becoming a popular political activist write the foreword to Tolstoy's essay, A letter to a Hindu. Gandhi exchanged letters with Tolstoy and named his ashram Tolstoy Farm. In Gandhian thought, Tolstoy's 1894 book The Kingdom of God Is Within You sits alongside A plea and Civil Disobedience. Tolstoy Farm was Gandhi's experiment of his utopian political economy - later to be called 'Gram Swaraj'. One key source of this concept was John Ruskin's Unto This Last in which Ruskin critiques the 'economic man' (this was written after Ruskin's retreat from Art criticism for which he was well-known). Gandhi tried in all his Ashrams a system of self-sufficiency and decentralised economies. Gandhi was gifted this book by his close associate named Henry Polak in South Africa. The philosophy of Ruskin urged Gandhi to translate this work into Gujarati. In the Indian Opinion, we find mention of Giuseppe Mazzini, Edward Carpenter, Sir Henry Maine, Helena Blavatsky. His first exploration of pluralism can be said to have begun with his association with the Jain guru near home, Raychandbhai Mehta. Satyagraha Satyagraha is formed by two Sanskrit words Satya (truth) and Agraha (seek/desire). The term was popularised during the Indian Independence Movement, and is used in many Indian languages including Hindi. =Satya= The pivotal and defining element of Gandhism is satya, a Sanskrit word for truth.A. A. Macdonell, Sanskrit English Dictionary, Asian Educational Services, , page 330-331J. Wentzel Vrede van Huyssteen et al. (2003), Encyclopedia of Science and Religion, Thomson Gale, , page 405 It also refers to a virtue in Indian religions, referring to being truthful in one's thought, speech and action. Satya is also called as truth.KN Tiwari (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 87 Gandhi said:- \\"The truth is far more powerful than any weapon of mass destruction.\\"Nonviolence By Senthil Ram, Ralph Summy, 2007 Pacifism and Ahimsa The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) and nonviolent resistance has a long history in Indian religious thought and has had many revivals in Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, and Jain contexts. Gandhi explains his philosophy and way of life in his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth. He was quoted as saying that: :\\"What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless, whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty and democracy?\\"page 388, The collected works of Mahatma Gandhi, by Gandhi (Mahatma), India. Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Publications Division :\\"It has always been easier to destroy than to create\\".Trustworthiness by Bruce Glassman ‚Äì Juvenile Nonfiction ‚Äì 2008 :\\"There are many causes that I am prepared to die for but no causes that I am prepared to kill for\\".Trustworthiness, by Bruce Glassman ‚Äì Juvenile Nonfiction ‚Äì 2008 In 1918, Mahatma Gandhi issued two public appeals for Indians to enlist in the British army to fight in World War I. He asserted that fighting in the war would provide Indians necessary self-defense skills that had been eroded by the deep-seated influence of India's ascetic culture, which he disdained. This advocacy of violence led some of his staunchest supporters, including his nephew, Maganlal Gandhi, to question whether Gandhi was forsaking his non- violent ideals. In a July 1918 letter replying to his nephew, Gandhi stated that any conception of non-violence that prohibited self-defense was erroneous. To support this argument, Gandhi criticized the ethics of love and absolute ahimsa (non-violence) he observed in the teachings of Swaminarayan and Vallabhacharya. According to Gandhi, this love was mere \\"sentimentalism\\", and its concomitant absolute ahimsa \\"robbed us of our manliness\\" and \\"made the people incapable of self-defence\\". Gandhi wrote that Swaminarayan and Vallabhacharya had not grasped the essence of non-violence. Instead Gandhi argued for a non-violence that would \\"permit [our offspring] to commit violence, to use their strength to fight\\", since that capacity for violence could be used for the benefit of society, like in \\"restraining a drunkard from doing evil\\" or \\"killing a dog‚Ä¶infected with rabies\\". By 1924, however, Gandhi's criticism of Swaminarayan and his ethical teachings had turned into admiration. While arguing in a Navjivan newspaper editorial that it was a duty to resort to violence for self-defense against Afghani terrorists, Gandhi admitted that he could not personally adopt this approach because he had chosen the path of love even against his enemies. Gandhi explained that, according to the Hindu scriptures, a single such self-controlled person could eradicate violence from the hearts of one's opposition. It was through this power of love that Gandhi asserted, \\"what was accomplished in Gujarat by one person, Sahajanand [Swaminarayan], could not be accomplished by the power of the State\\". Moreover, he said that \\"The Age of Sahajanand has not come to an end. It is only devotion and self-control like his that are wanted\\". Ultimately, Gandhi said that while he was attempting Swaminarayan's approach himself, he did \\"not have the strength of heart to act upon\\" it the way that Swaminarayan had successfully done. Over time, Gandhi's religious thought showed a further influence of Swaminarayan's teachings, as, by 1930, he had included many hymns composed by Swaminarayan poets in his Ashram Bhajanavali, a book of prayers which were used in his twice-daily prayer service. In his writings, he often drew inspiration from the spiritual teachings of Swaminarayan saint-poets Nishkulanand Swami and Muktanand Swami, the latter being the author of his most frequently used prayer. Indian sociologist and Gandhian contemporary, N. A. Thoothi, had argued by 1935 that Mahatma Gandhi was \\"most influenced in his inner-most being‚Ä¶ by the teachings of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya above all\\". Thoothi concluded that \\"most of [Gandhi‚Äôs] thought, activities, and even methods of most of the institutions which he has been building up and serving, have the flavor of Swaminarayan, more than that of any other sect of Hinduism\\". On 6 July 1940, Gandhi published an article in Harijan which applied these philosophies to the question of British involvement in World War II. Homer Jack notes in his reprint of this article, \\"To Every Briton\\" (The Gandhi ReaderThe Gandhi Reader) that, \\"to Gandhi, all war was wrong, and suddenly it 'came to him like a flash' to appeal to the British to adopt the method of non-violence.\\"Jack, Homer. Gandhi Reader, p.344 In this article, Gandhi stated, :I appeal to every Briton, wherever he may be now, to accept the method of non-violence instead of that of war, for the adjustment of relations between nations and other matters [...] I do not want Britain to be defeated, nor do I want her to be victorious in a trial of brute strength [...] I venture to present you with a nobler and braver way worthier of the bravest soldier. I want you to fight Nazism without arms, or, if I am to maintain military terminology, with non-violent arms. I would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions. Let them take possession of your beautiful island, with your many beautiful buildings. You will give all these but neither your souls, nor your minds. If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourself, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them [...] my non-violence demands universal love, and you are not a small part of it. It is that love which has prompted my appeal to you.Jack, Homer. Gandhi Reader, pp.345‚Äì6 Economics Gandhi espoused an economic theory of simple living and self-sufficiency/import substitution, rather than generating exports like Japan and South Korea did. He envisioned a more agrarian India upon independence that would focus on meeting the material needs of its citizenry prior to generating wealth and industrialising. =Khadi= Gandhi also adopted the clothing style of most Indians in the early 20th century. His adoption of khadi, or homespun cloth, was intended to help eradicate the evils of poverty, social and economic discrimination. It was also aimed as a challenge to the contrast that he saw between most Indians, who were poor and traditional, and the richer classes of educated, liberal-minded Indians who had adopted Western mannerisms, clothing and practices. The clothing policy was designed to protest against British economic policies in India. Millions of poor Indian workers were unemployed and entrenched in poverty, which Gandhi linked to the industrialisation of cotton processing in Britain. Gandhi promoted khadi as a direct boycott of the Lancashire cotton industry, linking British imperialism to Indian poverty. He focused on persuading all members of the Indian National Congress to spend some time each day hand-spinning on the charkha (spinning wheel). In addition to its point as an economic campaign, the drive for hand-spinning was an attempt to connect the privileged Indian brahmins and lawyers of Congress with the mass of Indian peasantry. Many prominent figures of the Indian independence movement, including Motilal Nehru, were persuaded by Gandhi to renounce their smart London-made clothes in favour of khadi. Fasting To Gandhi, fasting was an important method of exerting mental control over base desires. In his autobiography, Gandhi analyses the need to fast to eradicate his desire for delicious, spicy food. He believed that abstention would diminish his sensual faculties, bringing the body increasingly under the mind's absolute control. Gandhi was opposed to the partaking of meat, alcohol, stimulants, salt and most spices, and also eliminated different types of cooking from the food he ate. Fasting would also put the body through unusual hardship, which Gandhi believed would cleanse the spirit by stimulating the courage to withstand all impulses and pain. Gandhi undertook a \\"Fast Unto Death\\" on three notable occasions: *when he wanted to stop all revolutionary activities after the Chauri Chaura incident of 1922; *when he feared that the 1932 Communal Award giving separate electorates to Untouchable Hindus would politically divide the Hindu people; *and in 1947, when he wanted to stop the bloodshed between Hindus and Muslims in Bengal and Delhi. In all three cases, Gandhi was able to abandon his fast before death. There was some controversy over the 1932 fast, which brought him into conflict with the other great leader B.R. Ambedkar. In the end, Gandhi and Ambedkar both made some concessions to negotiate the Poona Pact, which abandoned the call for separate electorates in turn for voluntary representation and a commitment to abolish untouchability. Gandhi also used the fasts as a penance, blaming himself for inciting Chauri Chaura and the divisive communal politics of both 1932 and 1947, especially the Partition of India. Gandhi sought to purify his soul and expiate his sins, in what he saw as his role in allowing terrible tragedies to happen. It took a heavy toll on his physical health and often brought him close to death. Religion Gandhi described his religious beliefs as being rooted in Hinduism as well and the Bhagavad Gita: :\\"Hinduism as I know it satisfies my soul, fills my whole being. When doubts haunt me, when disappointments stare me in the face, and when I see not one ray of light on the horizon, I turn to the Bhagavad Gita, and find a verse to comfort me; and I immediately begin to smile in the midst of overwhelming sorrow. My life has been full of tragedies and if they have not left any visible and indelible effect on me, I owe it to the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita\\".Encyclopaedia of Indian philosophy by Vraj Kumar Pandey ‚Äì History ‚Äì 2007 He professed the philosophy of Hindu Universalism (also see Universalism), which maintains that all religions contain truth and therefore worthy of toleration and respect. It was articulated by Gandhi: :\\"After long study and experience, I have come to the conclusion that all religions are true all religions have some error in them; all religions are almost as dear to me as my own Hinduism, in as much as all human beings should be as dear to one as one's own close relatives. My own veneration for other faiths is the same as that for my own faith; therefore no thought of conversion is possible.\\"M. K. Gandhi, All Men Are Brothers: Life and Thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi as told in his own words, Paris, UNESCO 1958, p 60. Gandhi believed that at the core of every religion was truth (satya), non- violence (ahimsa) and the Golden Rule. Despite his belief in Hinduism, Gandhi was also critical of many of the social practices of Hindus and sought to reform the religion. :\\"Thus if I could not accept Christianity either as a perfect, or the greatest religion, neither was I then convinced of Hinduism being such. Hindu defects were pressingly visible to me. If untouchability could be a part of Hinduism, it could but be a rotten part or an excrescence. I could not understand the raison d'etre of a multitude of sects and castes. What was the meaning of saying that the Vedas were the inspired Word of God? If they were inspired, why not also the Bible and the Koran? As Christian friends were endeavouring to convert me, so were Muslim friends. Abdullah Sheth had kept on inducing me to study Islam, and of course he had always something to say regarding its beauty\\". He then went on to say: :\\"As soon as we lose the moral basis, we cease to be religious. There is no such thing as religion over-riding morality. Man, for instance, cannot be untruthful, cruel or incontinent and claim to have God on his side\\".Mahatma Gandhi and comparative religion ‚Äì Page 54 , by K.L. Seshagiri Rao ‚Äì Biography & Autobiography ‚Äì 1990 Gandhi was critical of the hypocrisy in organised religion, rather than the principles on which they were based. : Later in his life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied: :\\"Yes I am. I am also a Christian, a Muslim, a Buddhist and a Jew\\".A Man Called Bapu, Subhadra Sen Gupta, Pratham Books, 2008. P.5 Gandhi's religious views are reflected in the hymns his group often sang: * Vaishnav jan to Call them Vishnava, those who understand the sufferings of others... * Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram Call him Rama or God or Allah... Nehru's India Gandhi was assassinated in 1948, but his teachings and philosophy would play a major role in India's economic and social development and foreign relations for decades to come. Sarvodaya is a term meaning 'universal uplift' or 'progress of all'. It was coined by Gandhi in 1908 as a title for his translation of John Ruskin's Unto This Last. Later, nonviolence leader Vinoba Bhave used the term to refer to the struggle of post-independence Gandhians to ensure that self-determination and equality reached the masses and the downtrodden. Sarvodaya workers associated with Vinoba, including Jaya Prakash Narayan and Dada Dharmadhikari, undertook various projects aimed at encouraging popular self-organisation during the 1950s and 1960s. Many groups descended from these networks continue to function locally in India today. The Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, was often considered Gandhi's successor, although he was not religious and often disagreed with Gandhi. He was, however, deeply influenced by Gandhi personally as well as politically, and used his premiership to pursue ideological policies based on Gandhi's principles. In fact, on 15 January 1942, in the AICC session Gandhi openly proclaimed Nehru as his successor. Nehru's foreign policy was staunch anti-colonialism and neutrality in the Cold War. Nehru backed the independence movement in Tanzania and other African nations, as well as the Civil Rights Movement in the United States and the anti-apartheid struggle of Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress in South Africa. Nehru refused to align with either the United States or the Soviet Union, and helped found the Non-Aligned Movement. Nehru also pushed through major legislation that granted legal rights and freedoms to Indian women, and outlawed untouchability and many different kinds of social discrimination, in the face of strong opposition from orthodox Hindus. Not all of Nehru's policies were Gandhian. Nehru refused to condemn the USSR's 1956‚Äì57 invasion of Hungary to put down an anti-communist, popular revolt. Some of his economic policies were criticised for removing the right of property and freedoms from the landowning peasants of Gujarat for whom Gandhi had fought in the early 1920s. India's economic policies under Nehru were highly different from Gandhi's with Nehru following a socialist model. Nehru also brought Goa and Hyderabad into the Indian union through military invasion. At this point it is important to note that Gandhi believed in a kind of socialism but one that was very different from Nehru's. In praise of socialism, Gandhi once said, \\"... socialism is as pure as a crystal. It therefore requires crystal- like means to achieve it.\\" Moreover Gandhi was conscious of the fact that Nehru's ideology differed from his but did not object to that as he was aware that this was a well-thought-out standpoint. He called this a difference in emphasis, his being on 'means' while Nehru's being on ends. Nehru's two biggest failures are thought to be: The Partition of India which he described and justified as \\"a necessary evil\\" and which would lead to the bloody and deadly Partition riots; and the Sino-Indian War of 1962, though his wartime policy is said to have been influenced by Gandhian pacifism. In this instance, it led to the defeat of the Indian Army against a surprise Chinese invasion. Nehru had neglected the defence budget and disallowed the Army to prepare, which caught the soldiers in India's north eastern frontier off-guard with lack of supplies and reinforcements. Freedom Gandhi's deep commitment and disciplined belief in non-violent civil disobedience as a way to oppose forms of oppression or injustice has inspired many subsequent political figures, including Martin Luther King Jr. of the United States, Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, Nelson Mandela and Steve Biko of South Africa, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa of Poland and Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar. Gandhi's early life work in South Africa between the years 1910 and 1915, for the improved rights of Indian residents living under the white minority South African government inspired the later work of the African National Congress (ANC). From the 1950s, the ANC organised non-violent civil disobedience akin to the campaign advanced by the Indian National Congress under the inspiration of Gandhi between the 1920s and 1940s. ANC activists braved the harsh tactics of the police to protest against the oppressive South African government. Many, especially Mandela, languished for decades in jail, while the world outside was divided in its effort to remove apartheid. Steve Biko, perhaps the most vocal adherent to non-violent civil resistance, was allegedly murdered in 1977 by agents of the government. When the first universal, free elections were held in South Africa in 1994, the ANC was elected and Mandela became president. Mandela made a special visit to India and publicly honoured Gandhi as the man who inspired the freedom struggle of black South Africans. Statues of Gandhi have been erected in Natal, Pretoria and Johannesburg. Martin Luther King Jr., a young Christian minister and a leader of the Civil Rights Movement seeking the emancipation of African Americans from racial segregation in the American South, and also from economic and social injustice and political disenfranchisement, traveled to India in 1962 to meet Jawaharlal Nehru. The two discussed Gandhi's teachings, and the methodology of organising peaceful resistance. The graphic imagery of black protesters being hounded by police, beaten and brutalised, evoked admiration for King and the protesters across America and the world, and precipitated the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The non-violent Solidarity movement of Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa of Poland overthrew a Soviet-backed communist government after two decades of peaceful resistance and strikes in 1989, precipitating the downfall of the Soviet Union. Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi was put under house arrest, and her National League for Democracy suppressed in their non-violent quest for democracy and freedom in military-controlled Myanmar. This struggle was inaugurated when the military dismissed the results of the 1991 democratic elections and imposed military rule. She was released in November 2010, when free elections were to be held. \\"Without truth, nothing\\" Mohandas Gandhi's early life was a series of personal struggles to decipher the truth about life's important issues and discover the true way of living. He admitted in his autobiography to hitting his wife when he was young,Mohatma Gandhi, (1957) An autobiography: The story of my experiments with truth (M. H. Desai Trans.). Beacon Press. pp. 24‚Äì25 and indulging in carnal pleasures out of lust, jealousy and possessiveness, not genuine love. He had eaten meat, smoked a cigarette, and almost visited a hustler. It was only after much personal turmoil and repeated failures that Gandhi developed his philosophy. Gandhi disliked having a cult following, and was averse to being addressed as Mahatma, claiming that he was not a perfect human being. In 1942, while he had already condemned Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and the Japanese militarists, Gandhi took on an offensive in civil resistance, called the Quit India Movement. Gandhians There have been Muslim Gandhians, such as Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, known as the \\"Frontier Gandhi\\"; under the influence of Gandhi, he organised the Pathans of the Northwest Frontier as early as 1919.Ronald M. McCarthy and Gene Sharp, Nonviolent action: a research guide (1997) p. 317 Christian Gandhians include Horace AlexanderHorace Alexander, Consider India: An Essay in Values (London: Asia, 1961), p. 73 and Martin Luther King Jr..Mary Elizabeth King, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr: the power of nonviolent action (UNESCO Publishing, 1999), p. 183 Jewish Gandhians include Gandhi's close associate Herman Kallenbach. Atheist Gandhians include Jawaharlal Nehru. Promotion of Gandhian ideas Several journals have also been published to promote Gandhian ideas. One of the most well-known is Gandhi Marg, an English-language journal published since 1957 by the Gandhi Peace Foundation.Ananda M. Pandiri, A Comprehensive, Annotated Bibliography on Mahatma Gandhi:Biographies, Works by Gandhi, and Bibliographical Sources Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995 (p. 349). Harold Dwight Lasswell, a political scientist and communications theorist, defined propaganda as the management of eclectic attitudes by manipulation of significant symbols. Based on this definition of Propaganda, Gandhi made use of significant symbols to drive his ideal of a united India free of British rule.Barlow, David M., and Brett Mills. \\"Harold D. Lasswell.\\" Reading media theory: thinkers, approaches and contexts. Second Edition ed. Harlow, England: Pearson Longman, 2012. 103. Print. His ideas symbolized in propaganda stated that India was a nation capable of economic self-sufficiency without the British, a unity transcending religion would make for a stronger nation, and that the most effective method of protest was through passive resistance, including non-violence and the principle of satyagraha. In the \\"Quit India\\" speeches, Gandhi says \\"the proposal for the withdrawal of British power is to enable India to play its due part at the present critical juncture. It is not a happy position for a big country like India to be merely helping with money and material obtained willy-nilly from her while the United Nations are conducting the war. We cannot evoke the true spirit of sacrifice and velour, so long as we are not free.\\" On his ideas towards a unified India he said: \\"Thousands of Mussalmans have told me, that if Hindu-Muslim question was to be solved satisfactorily, it must be done in my lifetime. I should feel flattered at this; but how can I agree to proposal which does not appeal to my reason? Hindu-Muslim unity is not a new thing. Millions of Hindus and Mussalmans have sought after it. I consciously strove for its achievement from my boyhood. While at school, I made it a point to cultivate the friendship of Muslims and Parsi co-students. I believed even at that tender age that the Hindus in India, if they wished to live in peace and amity with the other communities, should assiduously cultivate the virtue of neighbourliness. It did not matter, I felt, if I made no special effort to cultivate the friendship with Hindus, but I must make friends with at least a few Mussalmans. In India too I continued my efforts and left no stone unturned to achieve that unity. It was my life-long aspiration for it that made me offer my fullest co-operation to the Mussalmans in the Khilafat movement. Muslims throughout the country accepted me as their true friend.\\" Bandopadhaya, Sailesh Kumar. \\"The \\"Quit India\\" Resolution.\\" My non-violence. Ahmedabad: Navajivan Pub. House, 1960. 183-205. Print. Gandhi's belief in the effectiveness of passive, non-violent resistance has been quoted as being the \\"belief that non-violence alone will lead men to do right under all circumstances.\\" These ideas were symbolized by Gandhi through the use of significant symbols, an important proponent in the acceptance of propaganda, in his speeches and movements. On 3 November 1930, there was the speech given before the Dandi March which possibly could have been one of Gandhi's last speeches, in which the significant symbol of the march itself demonstrates the exclusively nonviolent struggle to empower a self-sufficient India. Beginning in Ahmedabad and concluding in Dandi, Gujarat, the march saw Gandhi and his supporters directly disobey the Rowlatt Act which imposed heavy taxation and enforced British monopoly on the salt market.Gandhi, M. K., and Mahadev Desai. \\"On The Eve Of Historic Dandi March.\\" The selected works of Mahatma Gandhi. Ahmedabad, India: Navajivan Publ. House, 1968. 28-30. Print. The Khadi movement, part of the larger swadeshi movement, employed the significant symbol of the burning of British cloth in order to manipulate attitudes towards boycotting British goods and rejecting Western culture and urging the return to ancient, precolonial culture. Gandhi obtained a wheel and engaged his disciples in spinning their own cloth called Khadi; this commitment to hand spinning was an essential element to Gandhi's philosophy and politics. On 1 December 1948, Gandhi dictated his speech on the eve of the last fast. Using the fast as a form of significant symbolism, he justifies it as \\"a fast which a votary of non-violence sometimes feels impelled to undertake by way of protest against some wrong done by society, and this he does when as a votary of Ahimsa has no other remedy left. Such an occasion has come my way.\\" This fast was conducted in line with his idea of a nation's communities and religions brought together. Gandhi's fast was only to end when he was satisfied with the reunion of hearts of all the communities brought about without any outside pressure, but from an awakened sense of duty.\\"Speech on the Eve of the Last Fast.\\" Famous Speeches by Mahatma Gandhi. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 March 2014. Criticism and controversy Gandhi's rigid ahimsa implies pacifism, and is thus a source of criticism from across the political spectrum. =Concept of partition= As a rule, Gandhi was opposed to the concept of partition as it contradicted his vision of religious unity.reprinted in The Essential Gandhi: An Anthology of His Writings on His Life, Work, and Ideas., Louis Fischer, ed., 2002 (reprint edition) pp. 106‚Äì108. Of the partition of India to create Pakistan, he wrote in Harijan on 6 October 1946: :[The demand for Pakistan] as put forth by the Muslim League is un-Islamic and I have not hesitated to call it sinful. Islam stands for unity and the brotherhood of mankind, not for disrupting the oneness of the human family. Therefore, those who want to divide India into possibly warring groups are enemies alike of India and Islam. They may cut me into pieces but they cannot make me subscribe to something which I consider to be wrong [...] we must not cease to aspire, in spite of [the] wild talk, to befriend all Muslims and hold them fast as prisoners of our love.reprinted in The Essential Gandhi: An Anthology of His Writings on His Life, Work, and Ideas.Louis Fischer, ed., 2002 (reprint edition) pp. 308‚Äì9. However, as Homer Jack notes of Gandhi's long correspondence with Jinnah on the topic of Pakistan: \\"Although Gandhi was personally opposed to the partition of India, he proposed an agreement [...] which provided that the Congress and the Muslim League would cooperate to attain independence under a provisional government, after which the question of partition would be decided by a plebiscite in the districts having a Muslim majority.\\"Jack, Homer. The Gandhi Reader, p. 418. These dual positions on the topic of the partition of India opened Gandhi up to criticism from both Hindus and Muslims. Muhammad Ali Jinnah and his contemporary fellow-travelers condemned Gandhi for undermining Muslim political rights. Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and his allies condemned Gandhi, accusing him of politically appeasing Muslims while turning a blind eye to their atrocities against Hindus, and for allowing the creation of Pakistan (despite having publicly declared that \\"before partitioning India, my body will have to be cut into two pieces\\"\\"The life and death of Mahatma Gandhi\\", on BBC News , see section \\"Independence and partition.\\"). His refusal to protest against the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Udham Singh and Rajguru by the British occupation authorities was a source of condemnation and intense anger for many Indians.Mahatma Gandhi on Bhagat Singh.Gandhi ‚Äì 'Mahatma' or Flawed Genius? . Economists, such as Jagdish Bhagwati, have criticized Gandhi's ideas of swadeshi. Of this criticism, Gandhi stated, \\"There was a time when people listened to me because I showed them how to give fight to the British without arms when they had no arms [...] but today I am told that my non-violence can be of no avail against the Hindu-Moslem riots and, therefore, people should arm themselves for self-defense.\\"reprinted in The Essential Gandhi: An Anthology of His Writings on His Life, Work, and Ideas., Louis Fischer, ed., 2002 (reprint edition) p. 311.

In 1944-45, he took a hat-trick against Bengal Governor's XI in Eden Gardens which included the wickets of Vinoo Mankad, Mushtaq Ali and Lala Amarnath.

Weekes cut Vinoo Mankad to gully, started to run and was sent back. Chowdhury sent the throw to wicket keeper Probir Sen who ran Weekes out. In 1951, he spent some time in Alf Gover's cricket school in England. He played a Test against England at home in 1951-52 without success and toured England in 1952 without playing in a Test. His bowling action was sometimes considered suspect, especially while bowling his faster ball.Exclusion of Chowdhury in Test Team\\", Indian Express, December 26, 1951 He was allotted a benefit match which could not be played.

C. Croker's Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland The clurichaun () or cl√∫rach√°n (from Yeats, W. B. (1888). Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry. London: Walter Scott. p. 80.) is a mischievous fairy in Irish folklore known for his great love of drinking and a tendency to haunt breweries, pubs and wine cellars.Briggs, Katharine (1976). An Encyclopedia of Fairies. Pantheon Books. p. 77. . He is related to the leprechaun and has sometimes been conflated with him as a shoemaker and a guardian of hidden treasure.Briggs (1976), pp. 264‚Äì6. This has led some folklorists to suppose that the clurichaun is merely a leprechaun on a drinking spree, while others regard them as regional variations of the same being.Croker, Thomas Crofton (1844, 1825). Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland (Vol. 1). Lea and Blanchard. p. 79. Like the leprechaun the clurichaun is a solitary fairy, encountered alone rather than in groups, as distinct from the trooping fairies. Folklore In the folktale \\"The Haunted Cellar\\", recorded by Thomas Crofton Croker in 1825, a clurichaun named Naggeneen haunts the wine cellar of an Irish lord, drinking everything in sight and playing frightening pranks on the servants. He is described as a little man measuring six inches in height with a face like a withered apple. He has twinkling eyes and a nose that is red and purple from heavy drinking. He wears a red nightcap, a short leather apron, light blue stockings, and shoes with large silver buckles. When he is discovered by the master of the house, Naggeneen talks him out of moving elsewhere by implying that he would simply move with him.Croker (1844, 1825), pp. 63‚Äì70. Other descriptions have him wearing red like other solitary fairies.O'Hanlon, John (1870). Irish Folk Lore. Cameron & Ferguson. p. 240. In another tale, \\"Master and Man\\", a young man named Billy Mac Daniel is on his way home one winter night when he is offered a glass of liquor by a clurichaun to warm himself. He takes the drink but when he refuses to pay for it he is compelled by the clurichaun to serve him for seven years and a day. Billy, however, is eventually able to break his servitude by invoking the blessing of God. In this story, the clurichaun is able to pass through keyholes to invade homes and wine cellars and can transform bog rushes into horses to be used as mounts.Croker (1844, 1825), pp. 70‚Äì76. Clurichauns can also fly through the air on rushes similar to witches and their broomsticks.Croker, Thomas Crofton (1828). Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland (Vol. 3). John Murray. p. 96. Thomas Keightley in his Fairy Mythology (1828) presents the story of a clurichaun named Little Wildbean who was more helpful than others of his kind, but also quick to anger and violence when slighted. He haunted the wine cellar of a Quaker gentleman named Harris, and if one of the servants was negligent enough to leave the beer barrel running then Little Wildbean would wedge himself inside to stop the flow until someone came to turn it off. His dinner was left for him in the cellar, but one night the cook left him nothing but part of a herring and some cold potatoes. At midnight Wildbean dragged the cook out of her bed and all the way down the hard cellar stairs, leaving her battered and bruised so that she was bedridden for three weeks. In a common folktale motif Mr. Harris tried to rid himself of Wildbean by moving elsewhere but decided to turn back when he discovered the clurichaun had moved with him.Keightley, Thomas (1884, 1828). The Fairy Mythology. London: George Bell & Sons. p. 369. The folklorist Nicholas O'Kearney described the clurichaun in 1855 as follows: Katharine Briggs stated that he was \\"a kind of buttery spirit, feasting himself in the cellars of drunkards or scaring dishonest servants who steal the wine.\\" He is also described as a trickster and practical joker, and a disturber of order and quietness in a household, making noise day and night. Despite his often troublesome nature, the clurichaun takes special care of the family to whom he has attached himself, endeavoring to protect their property and lives provided he is not interfered with. This dual nature makes him similar to the domestic hobgoblin. Besides his love of drinking, the clurichaun also enjoys pipe smoking, and the small disposable clay pipes known as \\"fairy pipes\\" that are often found while digging or plowing are said to belong to him. He also knows the secret of making beer from heather.Croker (1828), p. 9. Alternate spellings include cluracan, cluracaun,Evans-Wentz, Walter (1911). The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries. Henry Frowde, Oxford University Press. p. 30. cluricaun,Frost, William Henry (1900). Fairies and Folk of Ireland. Charles Scribner's Sons. p. 62. and cluricaune.Croker (1844, 1825), p. 63‚Äì79. Clurichauns and leprechauns Though generally regarded as separate beings, certain characteristics of the leprechaun have sometimes been merged with those of the clurichaun, particularly as a shoemaker and treasure guardian. The clurichaun is sometimes portrayed carrying a jug of ale or wearing a leather apron with hammer in hand, whistling as he works.Croker (1844, 1825), pp. 77‚Äì78. He also carries a magical purse (or sometimes a pewter beggars cup) with varying properties. It may contain a shilling (known as the \\"lucky shilling\\" or spre na skillenagh) that always returns to the purse no matter how often it is spent, or it may always be full of money, and for this reason mortals will often try to capture the clurichaun. Even if he is caught he has the power to vanish if he can make his captor look away even for an instant.Croker (1828), p. 8. He frequently carries two such purses, one containing the magic shilling and the other containing a normal copper coin, and if captured he will present the latter before vanishing. Like the leprechaun he is sometimes said to have knowledge of hidden treasure and can be forced to reveal its location. In such instances one of his tricks is to create the illusion of multiple treasure markers so that the seeker will not know its exact whereabouts. The clurichaun also shares many attributes with the biersal, a type of kobold stemming from Germanic mythology and surviving into modern times in German folklore. Literature A clurichaun named Kweequel is a prominent character in the first story of the book Four Different Faces by C.J. Cala.Cala, C.J. (2014). Four Different Faces p. 8. The clurichaun appears as a regular character (under the name Cluracan) in Neil Gaiman's acclaimed comic series The Sandman and its spin-off series The Dreaming. Cluracan continues the tradition of constant drunkenness but is portrayed as a tall, elegant blond fairy. The clurichaun Naggeneen (\\"a little drink\\") magically associates himself with \\"Mary's Place\\", the successor to Callahan's Bar in Spider Robinson's stories. The word is spelled 'cluricaune' there. 'Naggeneen' is used in place of his true name which is unwise for magical beings to reveal. Naggeneen saves the bar from bankruptcy through his ability to drink tremendous quantities of alcohol‚Äîand to pay for it honestly. The Fairyland series has a clurichaun named Gratchling Gourdborne Goldmouth, though he is completely unlike a typical clurichaun, being a massive and extremely violent savage. The comic strip \\"Arlo and Janis\\" for March 17, 2010. The image on the web has the title \\"Arlo and Janis St. Patrick 2010.png\\", but on the web pages it just has the generic \\"Arlo and Janis by Jimmy Johnson for March 17, 2010\\". has a clurichaun at the couple's door. Arlo greets him with a grin: \\"Faith an' begorra! 'Tis St. Patrick's Day, and here comes a leprechaun!\\" The caller, about half Arlo's height and with comic-strip \\"bubbles\\" in front of his scowling face to denote drunkenness, answers: \\"Actually, I'm a clurichaun.\\" Arlo: \\"A...what?\\" Clurichaun: \\"I'm like a leprechaun, but meaner... And given half a chance, I'll drink all your wine!\\" Arlo: \\"Oy vey!

The Pendleton Round-Up is a member of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). The ProRodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs, Colorado, inducted the Pendleton Round-Up in 2008. The Round-Up was incorporated as a 501(c)(4) not-for-profit organization on July 29, 1910, as the \\"Northwestern Frontier Exhibition Association\\". The rodeo was primarily a creation of local ranchers led by Herman Rosenberg.

It is the first book in the High Druid of Shannara trilogy in Brooks' Shannara series, and takes place 20 years after the events of The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara. It was first published in 2003. Plot summary In the 20 years since the events chronicled in The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara, Grianne Ohmsford has become High Druid, or Ard Rhys, of the new Druid Council, but not without misgivings by many over her former life as the evil Ilse Witch. In a bid for power, a group of Druids led by Shadea a'Ru use unorthodox magic called \\"liquid night\\" to send Grianne out of the Four Lands and into the Demon-infested world of the Forbidding. Tagwen, Grianne's loyal Dwarf aid, sets out to restore her, seeking the aid of her brother Bek Ohmsford. Finding Bek and his wife Rue Meridian otherwise disposed, Tagwen joins forces with their son Pen, who has a supernatural ability to commune with nature. Advised by the King of the Silver River, they set out in search of the legendary Tanequil tree, which they are told can provide a means to reach Grianne in the Forbidding. They are joined by the elf Ahren Elessedil, now a Druid, and his niece Khyber (heir to the magic Elfstones), as well as the mysteriously empathic Rover girl Cinnaminson, for whom Pen develops strong feelings. Along the way, they are stalked by traitorous Druid minions and their spider-like assassin accomplice, Aphasia Wye. They manage to defeat one of the pursuing Druid airships, but at the cost of Ahren's life and Cinamminson's capture. Meanwhile, Grianne finds the Forbidding to be a dark mirror of the Four Lands. Exploring this horrific land known locally as Jarka Ruus, she encounters an enigmatic and somewhat annoying creature called Weka Dart. After defeating a dragon like creature and knocking Weka Dart out of a tree, she has a frightening encounter with the shade of Brona, the most legendary evil from the Four Lands, and Grianne is captured by a party of Demons.

It is to the southeast of East Grinstead, just off the A22 arterial road. In 2001, the population was 1,771, increasing to 1,833 at the 2011 Census. Ashurst Wood is within the High Weald Area of Natural Beauty and has an SSSI inside its boundaries. The village has a history of agriculture and farming, and contains a church, village hall, primary school, two public houses, a general shop, post office and several small business premises. There is an independent school on the boundary of the village, called Brambletye School, and a former one, Stoke Brunswick School (the former junior school of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill), which closed in 2009. Bus routes run through the village with destinations of East Grinstead, Crawley and Tunbridge Wells.  History  The date of when the village was formed is not known. Two of the main roads in the village and Lewes Road (now part of the A22) were used as a ridge-way track for animals and people 5,000 years ago. There is evidence of a Roman ironworks in the village. By 1066, the area had two established farms, the tracks between them are still in use today as roads. The name of Ashurst Wood dates back to 1164 when the region was known as Aesehyrst Wilde. There was no village then and the name was used for a common area. During the reign of Henry II, the area that is now Ashurst Wood was called, Esseherst. The names Aisherst, Askhurst and Eseherst were in use in the years 1186, 1248 and 1279 respectively. Around 1300 a house was built, part of which remains as the Headmaster's drawing room in Stoke Brunswick School, and has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building. By the time of the reign of Elizabeth I, Ashurst Wood had prosperous farms, with Water Farmhouse being built in the 16th century, Great Surries dating from the 17th century, and its barn being slightly more recent. The population grew and more houses were built in the village. in 1855, the nearby town of East Grinstead was connected to London by rail, and another rail connection to the area in 1884 meant that Ashurst Wood was more accessible. Many wealthy people bought property in the area and this provided work other than that of the agricultural type. The village school began in new premises built for 240 children on 30 September 1910. It is still in use as the primary school. During World War I, many villagers volunteered to serve in the armed forces. Back in the village efforts to help the war included making sandbags to be sent to the front. In 1931, construction was complete on St Dunstan's Hall, which is now the Village Centre. The hall was immediately put to good use for many activities by villagers. Ashurst Wood experienced World War II first hand with bullets from planes hitting the school. Dogfights were regularly seen in the skies above and around the village, and buildings that used to be part of Stoke Brunswick School were used for nursing allied airmen. In 1944, the village was hit by a series of V-1 flying bombs, Doodlebugs, leaving craters that are still visible today. Since the Second World War, the village has been expanded by suburban development. In December 1978, construction started on the United Reformed Church in the village to convert it into the new and current St. Dunstan's Church. The work was completed in Summer 1979 and dedicated in September by the Bishop of Horsham. The lease for St. Dunstan's Hall was taken over by the Ashurst Wood Community Association from the church and became the Village Centre in 1980. The hall was then renovated by local builders and has since been put to use by youth clubs, local theatre and many more activities.

Ashurst Wood Village Council is the official elected body of local government representatives for the civil parish of Ashurst Wood, having changed its name from Ashurst Wood Parish Council on 1 January 2016. There are nine councillors. The Village council meets ten times per year and meetings can be attended by the public. In 2000, Ashurst Wood became a civil parish and a parish council was formed. In the 1870s the ecclesiastical parish of Forest Row was formed and much of Ashurst Wood was included in its governing. In 1894 the civil parish of Forest Row was formed and the village was a ward within this parish, in the administrative county of East Sussex. In 1934 the village was transferred from the Forest Row parish council to the East Grinstead Urban District Council then in East Sussex. Under the 1974 local government reorganisation, East Grinstead Urban District Council was abolished with a new parish authority East Grinstead Town CouncilEast Grinstead Town Council , Centre website formed within the new Mid Sussex District. Under these changes the East Grinstead parish was also moved from East to West Sussex. Ashurst Wood was then governed by East Grinstead Town Council until 2000. Up until 1992 Ashurst Wood was split by the administrative boundary of East and West Sussex, which meant parts of the village were under the control of Forest Row Parish Council and other parts East Grinstead Town Council. A plan to transfer land on the East Sussex part over to West Sussex County Council was submitted to the Secretary of State for the Environment, and in 1993 the boundary changes came into force. Ashurst Wood is now in the District of Mid Sussex which is mostly covered by the Mid Sussex parliamentary constituency. Nicholas Soames, grandson of UK Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill, is its Conservative member of parliament. In the 2005 local elections Nicholas Soames held his seat by winning the vote with 48.0%, a 1.8% increase than the previous election. The Liberal Democrats followed with 36.1%, a 5% increase. Labour received 12.7% of the vote, down 6.3% and The United Kingdom Independence Party received 3.2% of the vote, up 0.7% on the previous election. In 2005 a committee formed with the aim of creating an action plan to implement progress for the village. In 2006 a comprehensive questionnaire was produced and given to the villagers to ascertain what actions should be taken. 55% of the questionnaires were returned and general population data recorded by this questionnaire echoed the findings of the 2001 census. The questionnaire resulted in a document called the Ashurst Wood ‚Äì Village Action Plan which was published in April 2007. The document contained time scales for targets and actions that would be taken.Ashurst Wood ‚Äì Village Action Plan. (print) Village Plan Steering Committee (April 2007)  The Ashurst Wood Neighbourhood Plan  In the September 2015 the Village Council submitted the Ashurst Wood Neighbourhood Plan 2015‚Äì2031 to Mid Sussex District Council, with a view to its adoption as a statutory planning document. The plan's Vision is: \\"To preserve and protect Ashurst Wood's characteristics as a rural village, while at the same time ensuring that it remains a vibrant, safe, and welcoming community, and an attractive location for people to live.\\" Geography Ashurst Wood is situated on a prominent ridge to the southeast of East Grinstead and is above sea level,US Geological Survey. (2007) This means the area is not prone to heavy flooding. Several farms are within the boundaries of the village which keep various livestock such as sheep and pigs, but Ashurst Wood is primarily a residential village. The village primarily stands on Tunbridge Wells Sand and Wadhurst Clay. The combination of permeable and impermeable types creates an abundance of streams and springs in woodland areas. These are known Ghyll springs and streams, and are common in the High Weald. Mills Rocks in the north of the village is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is an area consisting of outcrops of sandstone, and is currently designated as Unfavourable recovering, which means that it is not yet fully conserved but all the necessary management measures are in place. Provided that the recovery work is sustained, the SSSI will reach favourable condition in time. Community facilities =Education= There are two schools in Ashurst Wood: a state primary school and an independent junior school. Ashurst Wood Primary School is a co-educational, non-denominational state school for children aged four to eleven years, and has been in its current location since 1910. At the 2006 Ofsted inspection, there were 116 pupils enrolled at the school. In the Ofsted report, the school received satisfactory grades in the overall Inspection Judgements. In 2006, Ashurst Wood Primary School received the International School Award. To receive this award, the school is involved in an international link with Mervin Iverson Elementary in Las Vegas, United States. Members of staff have visited each school and the students are in contact with each other and are involved in joint activities. Brambletye School is an independent co-educational day and boarding school for pupils aged seven to thirteen years. The school's grounds cover to the south west of the village. The preparatory school has been coeducational since 2000 but the pre-prep school has always accepted girls. In 2001, the Independent Schools Inspectorate found that there were 206 pupils at the school, 99 of which are boarding there. The ISI report findings showed that the school was doing very well with small room for improvement. In 2012 the ISI reported that \\"The school does not meet all the National Minimum Standards for Boarding Schools\\".http://www.isi.net/schools/6271/ The former Stoke Brunswick School, although having a postal address of Ashurst Wood, was outside the parish. =Sports and recreation= The John Pears Field pavilion.The John Pears Recreation Field and The Recreation Ground are the two recreational fields in Ashurst Wood. John Pears Recreation Field became council property when it was donated by local resident Mrs Pears as a memorial to her husband. The land covers just over two hectares and contains a pavilion, barbecue for public use, a tennis area, fenced-off play area and a basketball hoop. The field is maintained by the local council. The field used to be home to the Strawberry Fair which was an annual event held in the village, the first of which took place in 1978 and was opened by BBC Radio 2 DJ Don Moss. In 2003 the pavilion was burnt down in an act of arson. After some fundraising, steps were made to have a new one built. Construction was completed in 2005 and opened on 2 June. In more recent times the field has been used for \\"Ashstock\\", the annual village beer and music festival featuring local youth talent and real ale. The other recreational field known locally as The Rec, is where the Mid-Sussex Football League division 2 team Ashurst Wood F.C. plays its home games. The team was formed around the early 1920s. The recreation ground was also home to the village cricket team which had been running for over 100 years, but folded due to lack of participants in 1999. The Ashurst Wood Village Centre is a village hall which hosts dance, carpet bowls and the annual Christmas Market and Village Meeting. A recent addition to the Village Centre is the Ashurst Wood Village Council Offices and Meeting Room. =Other facilities= Ashurst Wood is served by Metrobus bus services, with destinations of Crawley, Royal Tunbridge Wells and Uckfield. There is a community funded bus service called EG Bus that provides a ride to East Grinstead for the elderly and disabled. The bus picks up people from various places in the village to take them to East Grinstead and relies on volunteer drivers. In the village there is Allan Martin Meats, an award-winning butchers shop. In 2008 the butchers provided meat for television chef Gordon Ramsay for a programme aired on Channel 4. P.R.A.W.N.S. To celebrate the millennium, in January 2000 some residents of Ashurst Wood unofficially declared independence from the United Kingdom. The new state was known as The People's Republic of Ashurst Wood, a Nation State, which gave the acronym P.R.A.W.N.S.. This was reported in the local and national media, notably by the radio DJ Chris Moyles during his show on BBC Radio 1. The \\"revolution\\" was said to be justified because of a ruling by King Ethelred in the year 979, specifying that the village of Ashurst would be immune from taxation after he fell ill there.

The \\"TO\\" designation stands for \\"transistor outline\\".List of semiconductor cases, http://malaysia.rs- online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=centre/eem_techref_semipack TO-220 packages have three leads. Similar packages with two, four, five or seven leads are also manufactured. A notable characteristic is a metal tab with a hole, used in mounting the case to a heatsink,Torque Recommendations for TO-220 Devices, http://www.vishay.com/docs/72674/72674.pdf allowing the component to dissipate more heat than one constructed in a TO-92 case. Common TO-220-packaged components include discrete semiconductors such as transistors and silicon-controlled rectifiers, as well as integrated circuits. Typical applications The TO-220 package is a \\"power package\\" intended for power semiconductors and an example of a through-hole design rather than a surface- mount technology type of package. TO-220 packages can be mounted to a heat sink to dissipate several watts of waste heat. On a so-called \\"infinite heat sink\\", this can be 50 W or more. The top of the package has a metal tab with a hole used in mounting the component to a heat sink. Thermal compound is often applied between package and heatsink to further improve heat transfer. The metal tab is often connected electrically to the internal circuitry. This does not normally pose a problem when using isolated heatsinks, but an electrically-insulating pad or sheet may be required to electrically isolate the component from the heatsink if the heatsink is electrically conductive, grounded or otherwise non-isolated. Many materials may be used to electrically isolate the TO-220 package, some of which have the added benefit of high thermal conductivity. In applications that require a heatsink, damage or destruction of the TO-220 device due to overheating may occur if the heatsink is dislodged during operation. A heatsinked TO-220 package dissipating 1 W of heat will have an internal (junction) temperature typically 2 to 5 ¬∞C higher than the package's temperature (due to the thermal resistance between the junction and the metal tab), and the metal tab of the TO-220 package will typically have a temperature 1 to 60 ¬∞C higher than the ambient temperature, depending on the type of heatsink (if any) used. The junction-to-case thermal resistance of a TO-220 packaged device (which typically matters less than the case-to-ambient thermal resistance), depends on the thickness and the area of the semiconductor die inside the package, typically in a range between 0.5 ¬∞C/W and 3 ¬∞C/W (according to one textbook) or 1.5 ¬∞C/W and 4 ¬∞C/W (according to another). If more heat needs to be dissipated, devices in the also widely used TO-247 (or TO-3P) package can be selected. TO-3P has a typical junction- to-ambient (heatsink) thermal resistance of only about 40 ¬∞C/W, and its TO-3PF variant a slightly lower one. Further increase of heat dissipation capability is possible with power modules. When a TO-220 package is used without a heatsink, the package acts as its own heatsink, and the heatsink-to-ambient thermal resistance in air for a TO-220 package is approximately 70 ¬∞C/W.

These devices operate at DC or relatively low (audio) frequencies, since the TO-220 package is not intended for devices operating at radio frequencies. In addition to bipolar, bipolar Darlington, and power MOSFET transistors, the TO-220 case is also used for fixed and variable linear voltage regulator integrated circuits, and for Schottky diode pairs. http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm340.pdf http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/Datasheets/IRF540.pdf https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/ac/7b/4b/a6/d0/51/4e/52/CD00000912.pdf/files/CD00000912.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00000912.pdf Related packages *TO-257 is a hermetically sealed metal package that is otherwise considered equivalent to TO-220.\\"Power MOSFETs and IGBTs\\", Bill Travis, EDN: \\"[‚Ä¶] and the TO-257 is a hermetic TO-220.\\" *TO-220F also known as the SOT186 and SC67 is TO-220 like package, where the heatsink mounting tab has been encased in the plastic.http://www.nxp.com/packages/SOT186.html See also * TO-3, a metal case used for power semiconductors * TO-263, the surface-mount equivalent of the TO-220. * Chip carrier, chip packaging and package types list References External links *TO-220 standard from JEDEC * TO-220 outline drawing (ON Semiconductor) * TO-220AB outline drawing (Vishay Semiconductor) Category:Semiconductor packages ","title":"TO-220"},{"id":"2602588","text":"Tanequil is a fantasy novel by American writer Terry Brooks, part of the High Druid of Shannara trilogy of the Shannara series. First published in 2004, the book takes place immediately after the events of Jarka Ruus and is followed by the novel Straken. Plot summary Pen, Khyber, and company rescue Cinnaminson and continue their journey north, pursued continuously by traitorous Druids and the assassin Aphasia Wye. Meanwhile, the traitourous Druids find Pen's parents, Bek and Rue, and they agree to go back to Paranor to help to try to find their son Pen. The senior Ohmsfords recognize the deception and lies that the Druids have been telling them, so Bek attempts to locate Pen by using the magical scrye waters in the depths of Paranor. However, Bek and Rue are captured and unwillingly give Pen's position away. Pen and his friends find allies among the Troll people, led by Kermadec and his semi-estranged brother Atalan, who aid them in locating the mystical Tanequil tree on a ravine-surrounded island. From the Tanequil, Pen receives the enchanted wooden \\"darkwand,\\" a talisman that can aid him in saving his aunt. However, two of his fingers, as well as Cinnaminson, are taken in exchange. Pen and Aphasia meet in one last confrontation in which the assassin is killed by the Tanequil, but as Pen leaves the island, he finds the rest of his party taken hostage by the enemy Druid traitors. Meanwhile, the corrupt Federation army has unleashed a devastating new airship-mounted weapon in their war against the Elven and Free-born armies. A shape-shifting Demon called the Moric, has crossed over into the Four Lands from the Forbidding in exchange for Grianne's banishment. This creature, who has taken the form of a Druid advisor to the Federation leader, is intent on using the weapon to destroy the Ellcrys tree in Arborlon, which would allow the Demon hordes from the Forbidding to flood into the Four Lands. Finally, caged inside a Demon stronghold in the Forbidding, Grianne discovers the Straken Lord's master plan to have the Ellcrys destroyed, and how he manipulated Grianne's nemesis Shadea a'Ru to advance towards this goal. When Grianne is pitted in a contest against a horde of demonic Furies, she is forced to take a Demon-like form in a desperate attempt to survive. She then finds herself trapped in this form and unable to break free because she is unable to control the Wishsong's hold on her. However, the Straken Lord uses the enchanted conjure collar to subside her magic and she is again turned back to Grianne, but with the magic having taken an effect on her. Grianne's only hope for survival lies in the Straken Lord's former minion, Weka Dart.

First published in 2005, it takes place immediately after the events of Tanequil. Plot summary After receiving the darkwand from the Tanequil tree, Pen Ohmsford finds his companions‚Äîthe Dwarf Tagwen and a small troll force led by Kermadec and his brother Atalan‚Äîcaptured by Druid forces under the command of the illegitimate High Druid Shadea a'Ru. Pen agrees to be taken prisoner in exchange for their release. The elf-girl Khyber Elessedil, however, manages to stow away on the Druid airship before it leaves for Paranor. Meanwhile, Trefen Morys and Bellizen, Druids still loyal to the banished Ard Rhys, help spring Bek and Rue from Paranor's dungeons. After barely escaping with their lives, Bek is directed in a dream by the King of the Silver River to seek Pen's abandoned friends in Taupo Rough. He is told that Pen has made it into the Forbidding in order to save Grianne Ohmsford (the banished High Druid) and Bek will have to work together with each of Pen's companions to ensure their safe return. In a daring airship rescue, Bek and company save the Trolls and Tagwen from a marauding flood of wraithlike Urdas and return to Paranor, picking up a new army of Kermadec's Trolls along the way. Pen is imprisoned in Paranor and the darkwand is confiscated. Khyber soon springs him free, and together they make their way up to the High Druid's sleeping quarters, where the darkwand is secured. Pen grabs the darkwand and is transported to the realm of the Forbidding, while Khyber is taken prisoner and sentenced to death. On the Prekkendoran Plains, Pied Sanderling, Captain of the Elven Home Guard, successfully rallies the remaining Elven army to repel the advancing Federation forces and take refuge in a besieged Free-born camp. He leads a daring raid on the Federation base and manages to destroy the Dechtera, the airship that bears a devastating crystal-powered fire-launching weapon prototype. Unshaken, Prime Minister of the Federation Sen Dunsidan commissions the building of another such weapon, but continues to refuse the advice of his vizier Iridia, who wants him to attack Arborlon, the Elven capital. He finds out too late that Iridia is a Moric, a changeling Demon who escaped from the Forbidding when Grianne Ohmsford was banished, and is killed along with the weapon engineer Etan Orek. Taking the Prime Minister's form, the Moric takes the newly created weapon upon the airship Zolomach towards Arborlon, with the intent of destroying the Ellcrys tree-the only barrier keeping the armies of Demons from the Forbidding from flooding the Four Lands. Grianne Ohmsford, meanwhile, escapes the stronghold of the Straken Lord with the help of the Straken Lord's turncoat minion Weka Dart, promising him that she will take him back to the Four Lands if at all possible. They are chased through the tunnels under the fortress by a huge worm-like Graumth, and in a final stand, Grianne unleashes a powerfully destructive Wishsong that reminds her of her former life as the evil Ilse Witch, although the Wishsong had never before been this powerful or irrepressible. She speculates that her recent forced psychological transformation into a Fury may have awoken this frightening power in her. Escaping the catacombs, Grianne and Weka Dart are found by Pen, who has been guided to her location by the darkwand. Pen, too, has discovered magic within him, magic more powerful than the simple animal communication skills that he had been previously blessed with. Having survived several encounters with a massive dragon, Pen found that the darkwand had awoken in him the magic of the Wishsong, the magic that both his father and his aunt possess, and that it has not fully revealed itself even yet. Together, Pen, Grianne, and Weka Dart travel back to the place where they can use the darkwand to return to the Four Lands. Unfortunately, Grianne is forced to tell Weka Dart that it is unlikely that the darkwand will be able bring Weka back as well, sending him into a frenzy. After being explained to about the world that Grianne is returning to, he decided not to go to the world after all. He leaves in the middle of the night, never to be seen again. Pen and Grianne prepare to transport back to Paranor. Having returned to Paranor to help Pen and Grianne when they return, Bek, Rue, and Tagwen sneak in through a tunnel of Tagwen's finding, while Kermadec and his Troll army besiege the keep. Using a secret passage to the Ard Rhys' chambers, they discover Khyber, who escaped her executioners, hiding in the shadows. They find that Shadea a'Ru and her followers have set an inescapable magic trap, called a triagenel, in the chamber to incapacitate Grianne should she return from the Forbidding. Through the combined powers of Bek's Wishsong and Khyber's elfstones, the two manage to weaken the triagenel so that Grianne will be able to break free when it collapses upon her and Pen. Pen and Grianne return to Paranor and, after the triagenel is sprung, Grianne unleashes the power of her Wishsong upon it. This not only utterly destroys the triagenel, but also obliterates one of the walls of the room. Grianne sends Pen with his family and Khyber to find the Moric, while she confronts Shadea, Traunt, and Pyson herself. Reinforced at the last minute by Kermadec and his brother Atalan, Grianne defeats Shadea and her followers and retakes her rightful name as Ard Rhys. Aboard the airship Swift Sure, Khyber uses the Elfstones to discover that the Moric has taken the form of Sen Dunsidan and is headed for Arborlon. They catch up to him, and under the guise of a diplomatic meeting, trick him into taking the darkwand which transports both the Moric and the darkwand back into the Forbidding. The Moric is then presumably devoured by Pen's giant dragon. Finally, Grianne, having negotiated an arms treaty calling for the elimination of all crystal-based weapons research, retires as Ard Rhys. She travels with Pen to try to save Pen's girlfriend Cinnaminson, who was transformed into an Aeriad spirit of the Tanequil tree. She is able to, but only by taking the Rover girl's place as an Aeriad. As a spirit, she lives unfettered by both her guilt over her history as the Ilse Witch and her fear of evil awakening in her, and thus finds freedom.

When Depression era Illinois Traction was in financial distress and had to reorganize, the Illinois Terminal name was adopted to reflect the line's primary money making role as a freight interchange link to major steam railroads at its terminal ends, Peoria, Danville, and St. Louis. Interurban passenger service slowly was reduced, and it ended in 1956. Freight operation continued but was hobbled by tight street running in some towns requiring very sharp radius turns. In 1956, ITC was absorbed by a consortium of connecting railroads. History ITC was a successor in interest to a series of interurban railroads that were consolidated in the early 1900s by businessman William B. McKinley into the Illinois Traction System (ITS), an affiliate of the Illinois Power and Light Company. The Illinois Traction System, at its height, provided electric passenger rail service to 550 miles (900 km) of tracks in central and southern Illinois. Fehl, George. \\"The Illinois Traction System: Comprehensive Traction Maps and Railway Illustrations, Parts One-Four.\\" (G/S Productions, 1992). The system's Y-shaped main line stretched from St. Louis to Springfield, Illinois, with branches onward from Springfield northwest to Peoria and eastward to Danville. A series of affiliated street-level city trolley lines provided local passenger service in many of the cities served by the main line. The longest-lived segment was at East St. Louis area of the line descended from an Edwardsville-Alton interurban line bought by the Illinois Traction System in 1928. Because the Illinois Traction/Illinois Terminal traversed some towns on street trackage with very tight turns, freight operation required the use of short trains and special hardware. New bypass trackage was constructed around some towns for freight operation to partially solve this problem. Springfield was an example of this. In a few other towns, arrangements were made with a parallel steam railroad for trackage rights in order to provide a bypass. An example of difficult town running (for the town as well as the railroad) was at Morton, Illinois, just east of Peoria, where a heavy duty well maintained track with trolley catenary suddenly found itself running down the center of the town's brick paved main street.

The ITS relinquished many of its city streetcar lines in the 1930s, and due to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 it was forced to cut its ties with an affiliated firm that provided electrical utility services. The passenger railroad reorganized in 1937 as the Illinois Terminal Railroad (ITR) and continued to provide electric-powered interurban, long-distance multiple car passenger train service Peoria/Danville to St. Louis for almost another two decades. United States postal contracts helped provide revenue to make this service viable. One of the Streamliners in the early 1950s In the 1950s, with the final dominance of the automobile, ITC's passenger service became hopelessly unprofitable. This was even after IT had purchased three expensive electric multiple car streamlined train sets (\\"Streamliners\\") from St. Louis Car Company. These were capable of decent speeds on ITC's well-maintained open country roadbed, but had to negotiate tight streetcar-style curves in the numerous towns along the line; moreover, they suffered an abnormal number of failures. Worst of all, this new equipment generally failed to attract passengers, even on the St. Louis-Peoria runs which had no railroad or direct highway competition, despite having parlor-observation and dining facilities. On March 3, 1956, ITC's interurban passenger service ended, followed by its last passenger service, the St. Louis-Granite City suburban cars, in 1958. Because the ITR had some valuable trackage and lineside freight customers, it was acquired in June 1956 by nine Class I railroads. These collectively continued to operate ITR as a diesel-powered short line to carry freight to the acquiring railroads. The co-owned reorganized Illinois Terminal Railroad took down its trolley wire and abandoned much of its trackage, particularly the interurban street running in towns and villages. At various points ITC track was connected to trackage of adjacent lines and was available for optional routing. For the following 25 years (1956-1981) the ITC continued to operate diesel-powered trackage north and east of St. Louis, providing freight business for the railroads that owned it. The Norfolk and Western Railway purchased its partners' interests in the Illinois Terminal Railroad on September 1, 1981, and ITC officially merged into the N&W; on May 8, 1982. GP7 preserved in operating condition at Illinois Railway Museum Modern operations in St. Louis, Missouri In 1989, IT's successor Norfolk Southern sold IT's remaining active trackage in St. Louis, Missouri from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Headquarters building at 900 North Tucker Boulevard to the Branch Street Yard located immediately to the south of the McKinley Bridge to Ironhorse Resources, Inc., of O'Fallon, IL. Ironhorse formed a subsidiary for its St. Louis operation known as the Railroad Switching Service of Missouri (RSM). RSM existed to provide freight service to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which received boxcars loaded with newsprint spools that were delivered to an underground freight dock in the basement of its St. Louis headquarters building.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6t6L87KwfE The spools were used by the Post-Dispatch in the production of its daily circulation newspaper.

Heading north from the Post-Dispatch, the line continued in the subway for approximately four blocks and then ran for another three blocks through the center of Hadley Street. At the Interstate 70 overpass, the trackage meandered through North St. Louis via a 1.5 mile-long trestle to Branch Street where a small interchange yard with Norfolk Southern Railroad was located. RSM's operation of the St. Louis trackage continued until June 21, 2004, when an RSM crew pulled the last empty boxcar from the Post, which had elected to cease using rail service. Following this, RSM's parent company, Ironhorse Resources, applied for, and was subsequently granted, permission from the United States Surface Transportation Board to abandon the entire line on January 12, 2005.http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/taxreformpanel/notices/02-2005_05-1961.pdf After the tracks and related materials were removed, the subway tunnel under Tucker Boulevard was filled in.http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/limited-traffic-flows-along-new- tucker-boulevard-completion-set- for/article_b5d2e4cc-e5f9-5a12-a7d4-b07b7fb9c950.html Ironhorse Resources then sold the right-of-way and the trestle to Great Rivers Greenway, which plans on converting the trestle and portions of the right-of-way into a pedestrian and bicycle path.

Some sections of the Illinois Terminal Railroad and its affiliated lines have become rail-trails, such as the Interurban Trail south of Springfield. The Illinois Traction System's generating plants also sold electricity to customers in many towns and cities serviced by the electric railroad. In the 1930s, the railroad and its electrical utility separated from each other. The formerly-affiliated electrical utility was spun off to form the Illinois Power and Light Company. Illinois Power provided electrical service to much of central and southern Illinois before its acquisition by Ameren. Consolidation into the parent firm occurred in 2004. The Illinois Traction Building in Champaign, Illinois, also known as the Illinois Traction Station and the Illinois Power Building, was built in 1913 and was designed by Joseph Royer. It served as the headquarters of the Illinois Traction System, as well as the Champaign passenger depot. It then became the headquarters of the Illinois Terminal Railway, and, until 1985, Illinois Power and Light. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Norfolk Southern painted NS #1072, an EMD SD70ACe, into the Illinois Terminal scheme in 2012 as a part of the company's 30th anniversary.

He began his career in the labour movement, but was a strong opponent of socialism, and rejected the militant views held by many of his colleagues. Early life Veitch was born in Port of Menteith, a small town in Perthshire, Scotland. After receiving a basic education, he worked for the post and telegraph service until 1887. He then moved to New Zealand, briefly taking up gum digging before returning to telegraphs. In 1889, he joined the railways, eventually becoming an engine driver. During his railway career, he became active in the rail-workers union, and in 1908, he became its president. In comparison to other unionists at the time, Veitch was relatively moderate in his views, but was still dissatisfied with the government's response to various grievances. Believing that workers' goals were better served by political action than strikes, Veitch contested the Wanganui seat in the 1911 election, and defeated the incumbent MP, James Thomas Hogan. Despite there being two labour-aligned parties contesting the election, Veitch chose to stand as an independent Labourite. Parliamentary career =Early career= In Parliament, Veitch initially voted against the Liberal government of Joseph Ward. This was part agreement he had made with the opposition Reform Party, which had offered him support in his election bid. After discharging this obligation, however, he immediately became a Liberal Party supporter, voting in favour of Ward only two days later. He considered joining the Liberal Party, but when the new United Labour Party (ULP) was founded in 1912, Veitch joined that instead. The following year, when the ULP agreed to merge with the Socialist Party to form the Social Democratic Party, Veitch was among those who rejected the move, and continued to work under the ULP banner. His primary concern with the new Social Democrats were clauses which required the party to support strikes, which Veitch believed were ineffective and unnecessarily disruptive to society. Most of the ULP dissenters were eventually re-united with the Social Democrats when the modern Labour Party was formed, but Veitch remained in Parliament as an independent. In 1917, he unsuccessfully contested the Wanganui mayoralty. =Liberal Party= In 1922, he finally joined what remained of the Liberal Party. The Liberals were disunited and disorganised, and Veitch was a significant figure in the party's rejuvenation. In 1928, Veitch joined his faction of the Liberals with others led by George Forbes and Albert Davy, creating the United Party. Veitch and Forbes contested the leadership of the new group, but in the end, the position was given to Joseph Ward, a former Liberal Prime Minister brought in by Davy as a compromise candidate. =United Government= When the United Party formed a government, Veitch became a member of Cabinet, holding the mining, labour, and transport portfolios. Later, when Forbes succeeded Ward as Prime Minister, Veitch dropped the mining and labour portfolios and was made Minister of Railways. When United formed a coalition with the Reform Party, Veitch lost his position to make room for ministers from Reform. Later, when the coalition government devalued the currency, Veitch began to reject his party's leadership, and tried to convince William Downie Stewart to form a new party. End of Parliamentary career and later years In 1935, Veitch joined the \\"anti- socialist\\" Democrat Party launched by Albert Davy; but he was defeated in his re-election bid for Wanganui in the 1935 general election by the Labour candidate Joseph Cotterill. Considerably later, in 1943, Veitch stood for the National Party (the successor to the United-Reform coalition) in the Wellington Suburbs electorate, but was unsuccessful. He was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal in 1935 and the 1937 Coronation Medal for services to New Zealand (NZ Roll of Honour, p. 1095). Veitch died in Paraparaumu in 1961.

The Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility (TOCDF, also called Tooele Chemical Demilitarization Facility) or TOCDF, is a U.S. Army facility located at Deseret Chemical Depot in Tooele County, Utah that was used for dismantling chemical weapons. Disposal Destruction is a requirement under the Chemical Weapons Convention and is monitored by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Deseret Chemical Depot held 44% of the nation's chemical stockpile when processing began, and it had held some of these chemical munitions since 1942. TOCDF was constructed in the early 1990s and began destruction of chemical agent-filled munitions on 22 August 1996. As of September 2011, the facility had processed 99% of its stockpile.Monthly Update, Deseret Chemical Depot, October 2010 TOCDF processed all of its VX, sarin and mustard gas at its main facility; a smaller incinerator was installed west of the main plant in order to dispose of lewisite-filled containers.

Weapons disposal process The destruction process involves receiving the items in protective containers from a covered, protected storage area, and placing the items onto trays for insertion into the automated processing area. Inside the first automated area, the Explosion Containment Room, explosive components are removed from the items and destroyed in a rotating kiln called the Deactivation Furnace System. The items then are carried on automated cars to another room, called the Munition Processing Bay, where automated machinery sucks the liquid agent out. The liquid is sent to holding tanks. The nearly- empty items are then moved to the lower level on an automated lift, and introduced into a high-temperature (maximum 2,000 ¬∞F or 1,100 ¬∞C) oven called the Metal Parts Furnace, which destroys the residual agent so that the containers can be safely disposed of as scrap metal. The liquid agent is destroyed in one of two high-temperature (maximum 2,700 ¬∞F or 1,500 ¬∞C) ovens called Liquid Incinerators. The products of combustion from the ovens and kilns pass through extensive Pollution Abatement Systems, which catch the airborne products as salts, and hold them in a liquid slurry called brine, which is periodically shipped to out-of-state underground disposal facilities.

Its role is to enhance national security by securely storing the remaining U.S. chemical warfare materiel stockpiles, while protecting the work force, the public and the environment to the maximum extent. CMA leads the world in chemical weapons destruction with a demonstrated history of safely storing, recovering, assessing and destroying materials that remain as a legacy of the former U.S. chemical weapons program. CMA managed destruction of all U.S. chemical weapons stockpiles except for the two that fall under the Department of Defense Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives program. Through its Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP), CMA works with local, state and federal emergency preparedness and response agencies at chemical weapon stockpile locations.  History  The Army combined elements from the former United States Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command and the former Program Manager for Chemical Demilitarization to consolidate the Army's chemical agent and munitions storage and demilitarization functions under a single organization. CMA managed the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile at nine locations and had responsibility for chemical weapons disposal at seven of them. The demilitarization facilities were closed in the following order: * 2000: Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System (JACADS), South Pacific * 2005: Aberdeen Chemical Agent Disposal Facility (ABCDF), Maryland * 2008: Newport Chemical Agent Disposal Facility (NECDF), Indiana; Newport Chemical Depot closed * 2010: Pine Bluff Chemical Agent Disposal Facility (PBCDF), Arkansas * 2011: Anniston Chemical Agent Disposal Facility (ANCDF), Alabama * 2011: Umatilla Chemical Agent Disposal Facility (UMCDF), Oregon; Umatilla Chemical Depot closed * 2012: Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility (TOCDF), Utah located at Deseret Chemical Depot (DCD); DCD became Tooele Army Depot-South  Organization  CMA headquarters is at the Edgewood Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. CMA site teams are located at the individual stockpile locations where storage and destruction takes place. Only Pueblo, Colorado and Blue Grass, Kentucky still have weapons stockpiles which are managed by CMA although agent destruction will be handled by Program Executive Office, Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives.  Destruction  right CMA was responsible for two distinct chemical weapons destruction projects. For stockpile destruction, the Project Manager Chemical Stockpile Elimination managed the safe treatment and disposal of chemical weapons using incineration and neutralization technologies, completing its mission in 2012. Incineration was selected as the Army‚Äôs stockpile chemical weapons disposal technology in 1985 based on rigorous tests and comparisons of various technologies. Anniston, Alabama, Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Umatilla, Oregon, and Tooele, Utah, use incineration for chemical weapons destruction. The first incineration facility was built on Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and safely completed destruction operations in November 2000. The facility was dismantled and the atoll was returned to its natural state and serves as a wildlife refuge. Neutralization was selected as an alternative to incineration for bulk agent storage sites, where chemical agent was stored in large steel containers without explosives or other weapon components. Depending on the type of agent, neutralization destroyed the chemical agent by mixing it with hot water or hot water and sodium hydroxide. The industrial wastewater produced by the process, known as hydrolysate, was sent to a permitted commercial hazardous waste storage, treatment and disposal facility for treatment and disposal. This process was used safely in Edgewood, Maryland, to eliminate its entire stockpile of mustard agent, and in Newport, Indiana, to eliminate its entire stockpile of VX nerve agent. Neutralization is the selected method for the Department of Defense‚Äôs Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives facilities in Pueblo, Colorado, and Richmond, Kentucky. For chemical warfare materiel that was not part of the stockpile, the Non- Stockpile Chemical Materiel Project (NSCMP) was founded in 1992 to provide centralized management and direction to the Department of Defense for the destruction of declared non-stockpile chemical materiel in a safe, environmentally sound and cost-effective manner. Now known as the Recovered Chemical Materiel Directorate (RCMD), the organization‚Äôs responsibilities include assessment and treatment of recovered chemical warfare materiel declared prior to entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), an international treaty signed by the United States. RMCD‚Äôs non-intrusive assessment systems identify the chemical fill of recovered items and the presence of explosive components, allowing for proper handling and treatment. The items can be treated in an on-site system that contains any blast, agent and vapor. RCMD is best known for its history of responding to chemical weapons recovered at military installations, former defense sites and communities. RCMD's highly specialized equipment is employed in a manner that protects workers, citizens and the environment. In December 2006, CMA successfully completed demolition of the nation‚Äôs former chemical warfare production facilities. In November 2007, it successfully completed destruction of the binary chemical weapon inventory. In January 2012, all stockpiled chemical weapons had been destroyed at the 7 sites for which CMA had responsibility, representing 89.75% of the U.S. 1997 chemical weapon stockpile.Army Agency Completes Mission to Destroy Chemical Weapons , USCMA, January 21, 2012  Storage  CMA is responsible for the safe storage of the nation‚Äôs entire chemical weapons stockpile before its ultimate destruction. CMA manages a National Inventory Control Point and National Maintenance Point to ensure the stockpile is maintained safely and securely during its remaining storage life. CMA partners with the Department of Homeland Security through CSEPP to ensure effective emergency preparedness of the communities surrounding the stockpile storage sites. CSEPP provides funding for chemical accident response equipment and warning systems. CSEPP also oversees yearly community-wide emergency preparedness exercises at all of the stockpile sites and works with communities to conduct public education activities to enable residents to respond appropriately in the unlikely event of a chemical stockpile incident.  International cooperation  CMA is meeting its commitment as outlined in the 1997 CWC, which more than 180 nations have signed as their pledge to rid the world of this class of weapons. CMA also shares lessons learned through its reporting to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons which is charged with implementing the CWC. Finally, CMA participates in the annual international Chemical Weapons Destruction Conference in which experts from CWC member nations share technology and lessons learned.

As soon as the alert was sounded, area schools were notified of a possible terror threat.Tooele beefs up its preparedness. Deseret News (2007-04-10). Retrieved on 2012-01-19. Due to the proximity of the date of the intrusion to the September 11th attacks the year before, security was even higher than normal, and it was initially reported to KSL-TV in Salt Lake City, Utah that units from the 1st Battalion, 145th Field Artillery Regiment, a part of the Utah National Guard, had the intruder surrounded. Army officials later stated that the black-clad trespasser, sighted by four different soldiers during two different patrols, immediately ran off towards Ophir Creek, escaping capture, according to the depot Commander, Col. Peter C. Cooper. Despite the immediate setting up of roadblocks and a combined search by Army units and helicopters, no trace of the intruder was found. The search was suspended at approximately 8 PM that evening. Senate Approves Arming Pilots ‚Äì ABC News. Abcnews.go.com (2006-01-07). Retrieved on 2012-01-19. When asked why the intruder could have escaped capture, Wade Mathews of the Tooele County Emergency Management noted, \\"There's a lot of foliage out there.\\" Ophir Creek is lined with willows, he said. Depot spokeswoman Alaine Southworth states it was impossible to know if the \\"intruder\\" actually was someone from the depot who was in the wrong area, but everyone on the depot was accounted for after the warning. Additionally, she noted that they were not sure how the intruder gained access to the perimeter, as the fence had not been cut, and no vehicle had been found to aid the intruder in their escape. Col. Cooper emphasized that the intruder was not in the area where chemical weapons were stored, but \\"unsettling questions remain\\" about his intentions, as there was no evidence of anything being stolen or that terrorism was in fact involved. Base Closure During the 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC), Deseret Chemical Depot was recommended for closure if it was determined that it could not be used in the future for the demilitarization of conventional weapons. In such a case, supplies contained at the depot would be transferred to nearby Tooele Army Depot. Deseret Chemical Depot officially closed July 11, 2013; however, it is unclear whether or not the hundreds of government employees and contractors employed at the time have transferred to other bases.

Studying theatre and literature at Bennington College in Vermont,The Fall online-Biography Smith Start formed a group, Banda Dratsing, in which she performed as bassist/vocalist; she adopted the name \\"Brix\\" after the Clash's 1979 song \\"The Guns of Brixton\\". =The Fall= Smith Start met Mark E. Smith, vocalist of the Fall, at a Chicago concert in April 1983; she moved to his native England, where they settled in Manchester and married in July of that year. She joined the group on guitar and vocals for the album Perverted by Language. She co-wrote some of the best-regarded Fall tracks from the period, and is acknowledged for introducing a more mainstream, pop- oriented element to the group's sound. She remained with the Fall until her divorce from Smith in 1989. Acknowledging her importance to the band, some critics break the Fall's career and evolution into the pre-Brix years, the Brix years, and the post-Brix years. She rejoined for the recording and live promotion of the albums Cerebral Caustic (1995) and The Light User Syndrome (1996). =The Adult Net= In 1985, Smith Start launched side project the Adult Net with fellow Fall member Simon Rogers. Contributors included Mark E. Smith. The group released four singles for the Fall's label Beggars Banquet Records in 1985 and 1986, including a cover of Strawberry Alarm Clock's \\"Incense and Peppermints\\". The Adult Net released The Honey Tangle in 1989 on Phonogram Records. This line-up included Craig Gannon, The The member James Eller and Blondie drummer Clem Burke. =Brix & the Extricated= Smith Start reunited with former Fall members Steve Hanley and Paul Hanley as Brix & the Extricated for a one-off gig at the Manchester Ruby Lounge in December 2014. They played Fall songs to celebrate the launch of Steve Hanley‚Äôs book The Big Midweek: Life Inside The Fall. The success of the concert saw the band start performing more gigs and, in 2015, a national UK tour. They played the Rebellion Festival in August 2016, where Brix was interviewed by John Robb. The line-up is completed by guitarists Steve Trafford (another ex-Fall member) and Jason Brown. By this time new material was being written and introduced into the set. A single, \\"Something to Lose\\", was released on Blang Records in November 2016, followed by the album Part 2 in September 2017. Their second album, Breaking State, was released in October 2018 on Grit Over Glamour Records and almost exactly a year later in October 2019, their third album, Super Blood Wolf Moon, came out on the same label. Solo work and other activities After leaving the Fall and disbanding The Adult Net, Smith Start went on to tour with the Bangles. She became romantically involved with violinist Nigel Kennedy, and they collaborated on a cover of Donovan's \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\" for the 1992 Donovan tribute album Island of Circles; the song was released as a single in 1993 on Nettwerk. In 1994, Smith Start auditioned for Hole after the death of bassist Kristen Pfaff, but was in the group for one day. Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson, while supportive of Melissa Auf der Maur as Pfaff's replacement, later commented that he was a huge fan of Brix and expressed regret that he didn't get a chance to play with her in the group. In 1997, she released the Happy Unbirthday EP on Strangelove. The EP is a collaboration with Marty Willson-Piper and includes a cover of David Bowie's \\"Space Oddity\\". That year she also released solo LP Neurotica, as a digital download on Loser Friendly Records. She published her memoir The Rise, The Fall, And The Rise with Faber & Faber in May 2016, noting that \\"writing the book freed my creativity to play again.\\" Fashion career Smith Start married fashion entrepreneur Philip Start; in 2002, the couple opened a boutique, Start, in east London. Subsequently, the business expanded to four boutiques and an online store. The Shoreditch boutique closed in May 2015. In recent years Smith Start has appeared as a fashion expert on British television shows, including Channel 4's Gok's Fashion Fix. She also appeared on Animal Planet UK's Top Dog, The Culture Show on BBC Two, John Peel's Record Box, LK Todays 'What's Hot and What's Not' segment and Sky 1's Angela and Friends. Smith Start appeared as a fashion expert on Sky television's coverage of the 2011 Academy Awards in February 2011, and she took part in the fashion commentary in Channel 4's coverage of Royal Ascot in June 2013. That summer she presented the first series of Ultimate Shopper, broadcast in the UK by digital channel TLC.

The U.S. Army stored approximately twelve percent of its original chemical weapons at the Pine Bluff Arsenal since 1942. Destruction of the last chemical weapons occurred on November 12, 2010.\\"U.S. Army Completes Chemical Stockpile Destruction at Pine Bluff Chemical Agent Disposal Facility\\" (news release), U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency, Nov. 15, 2010. Manufacture and storage Pine Bluff Arsenal stored 90,409 M55 GB rockets, 19,608 M55 VX rockets, 9,378 M23 VX landmines and 3,705 mustard ton containers. It was also the home for the Binary Chemical Weapons Facility. The facility created one of the two toxic agents that would combine to form sarin. Construction of the diphenylcyanoarsine (DC) facility began in the mid-1980s and a classified number of canisters were produced. A facility was also planned to produce DC, but it was never constructed. A facility was planned to produce QL (diisopropyl aminoethylmethyl phosphonite), a precursor to the nerve agent VX. Construction began in the late 1980s, but it was mothballed prior to completion in the early 1990s as part of the chemical weapons treaties. Only partial construction of the Bigeye Bomb (BLU-80) fill and close facility at the Pine Bluff Integrated Production Facilities (IBPF) was completed and no filling of the air-delivered binary bomb ever took place. The Army only produced a few of these bombs. They remained empty or filled with a safe, simulated chemical for test purposes. International treaty inspectors witnessed the destruction of all these bombs in the summer of 1999. Decommissioning The Pine Bluff Chemical Agent Disposal Facility was completed in 2002, and the Army began weapons disposal in March 2005. By May 2007, the facility had destroyed all of its GB (sarin)-containing rockets and began processing VX-containing munitions. In February 2008 they processed their last VX-containing rocket and in May 2008 began processing VX landmines. Landmine processing was completed in June 2008 and the facility changed over to processing ton containers of mustard gas, the last remaining chemical weapons on site. Workers began destruction of mustard agent-filled ton containers in December 2008. The facility reached 100% destruction of its total chemical stockpile of 3,850 metric tons on November 12, 2010. The facility and Pine Bluff Chemical Activity are undergoing closure operations in accordance with strict internal policies and procedures and federal laws and regulations and were scheduled to be finished by 2014.

The Pueblo Chemical Weapons Depot Sulfur agent is destroyed through neutralization and biotreatment. Energetic components are first removed through robotics and disposed. The weapon body is then robotically accessed to wash out the sulfur agent using water at a high pressure. The sulfur agent is neutralized with caustic solution and hot water producing a byproduct of hydrolysate. Biotreatement occurs when the hydrolysate is further broken down with microbes, producing biosludge and water. Biosludge is filtered and sent to a disposal facility. Metal weapon parts are further decontaminated at high heat then recycled https://www.peoacwa.army.mil/pcapp/pcapp-destruction- technologies/neutralization-followed-by-biotreatment/ The Army's Explosive Destruction System (EDS) was used for problematic munitions that cannot be destroyed through neutralization and biotreatment until December 2018. In 2018, the decision was made to replace the EDS with three Static Detonation Chamber units which will be operational in late 2020. Problematic munitions are those that have leaked or are in poor physical condition making it difficult for automated equipment processing.https://www.peoacwa.army.mil/about-peo-acwa/ A specialized facility named the PCAPP Training Facility is located at the Pueblo Memorial Airport Industrial Park and offers training courses and simulations for employees. Training are designed to ensure the safety of the employees and the surrounding environment. Employee are trained to operate the equipment and use Demilitarization Protective Ensemble or DPE. The DPE is an encapsulated air- supplied chemical protective suit.https://www.peoacwa.army.mil/2016/10/17/facts-pcapp-training-facility/ Samples are taken at multiple stages and analyzed for any leakage of the chemical agent.https://www.nap.edu/read/19050/chapter/9 The plant will operate until all the chemical weapons have been destroyed. Closure activities (shut- down, dismantling, and restoration of site) are slated to be wrapped up by 2023. This is far beyond the April 2012 deadline set by the Chemical Weapons Convention. PuebloPlex will head the redevelopment of Pueblo Chemical Depot. Once the mustard agent has been treated and environmental restoration is complete, the depot will be transferred to the community with possibilities of solar farming to contribute energy to the military complex in Colorado Springs, Fort Carson, Peterson and Schriever Air Force bases.

It sanctions events in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil, with members from said countries, as well as others. Its championship event is the National Finals Rodeo. The PRCA is headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States.2018 PRCA Media Guide\\" \\"Introduction, About the PRCA, p. 6.  History  The organization was created in 1936 when a group of cowboys walked out of a rodeo at Boston Garden to protest the actions of rodeo promoter W.T. Johnson, who refused to add the cowboys' entry fees to the rodeo's total purse. Johnson finally gave in to the cowboys' demands, and the successful \\"strike\\" led to the formation of the Cowboys' Turtle Association. That name was chosen because, while they were slow to organize, when required they were unafraid to stick out their necks to get what they wanted, like turtles might do. Among the organizers was a woman, a four-time national bronc champion, Alice Greenough Orr. In 1945, the Turtles changed their name to the Rodeo Cowboys Association, and in 1975, the organization became the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. The PRCA staff consists of about 70 full-time employees, but grows to nearly 100 during the peak rodeo season. The PRCA headquarters, established in 1979 in Colorado Springs, also houses the ProRodeo Hall of Fame and Museum of the American Cowboy. For a list of inductees, see the List of ProRodeo Hall of Fame inductees.  Champions and hall of fame  The National Finals Rodeo and the National Finals Steer Roping award their champions and awards yearly at the end of the year and those awards are tracked in a separate article. The PRCA's board runs the Hall of Fame. More than 100 people and livestock are nominated each year, but only a few are selected.  Circuits and championships  =ProRodeo Tour= The top cowboys and cowgirls compete in 55 of the PRCA‚Äôs largest regular season rodeos where they try to earn points for the tour‚Äôs finals event, the ProRodeo Tour Finale, held every September in Puyallup, Washington. In 2020, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the tour finale was held in Rapid City, South Dakota. The competitor with the highest total points in each rodeo event is crowned the ProRodeo Tour Champion. While money won on the tour does count toward the world standings for the National Finals Rodeo, The ProRodeo Tour is points based. For example, If a rodeo in this tour awards twelve places, first place wins 120 points, and the rest are reduced by ten points each. =World‚Äôs Toughest Rodeo= This tour consists of PRCA bareback bronc riders, saddle bronc riders, and bull riders, as well as barrel racers from the Women‚Äôs Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA) competing in select midwestern and southeastern cities of the United States as annual events in the winter and early spring. Money won at each tour stop counts towards the PRCA world standings. =Xtreme Bulls= Since 2003, the PRCA has sanctioned events that feature bull riding alone called the Xtreme Bulls tour. These events are held in conjunction with less than a handful of the PRCA's several hundreds of annual rodeos. Forty PRCA bull riders compete in a select rodeo arena in a one-two day competition, and the top 12 riders based on scores come back to the championship round. The rider with the most points on two bulls wins the event. The PRCA crowns an Xtreme Bulls tour champion every year. This is the rider who wins the most money on tour. Bull riders must compete in at least forty complete PRCA rodeos if they want the money won on the Xtreme Bulls tour to count in the world standings towards the National Finals Rodeo. The Xtreme Bulls tour has Division 1 and Division 2 events. In 2003, the inaugural Xtreme Bulls Tour Finale was held in Kissimmee, Florida. In 2004, the tour finale was held in conjunction with the PRCA-sanctioned Ellensburg Rodeo in Ellensburg, Washington. In 2005, it was held in Reno, Nevada. From 2006 to 2008, it was held in Indianapolis, Indiana. From 2009 to 2019, it was consistently held in conjunction with the Ellensburg Rodeo. In 2020, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ellensburg Rodeo was cancelled, and thus the Xtreme Bulls Tour Finale had to be moved somewhere else. It was ultimately held in Nephi, Utah. 2018 PRCA Media Guide\\" \\"Xtreme Bulls, What is Xtreme Bulls?, p. 424. =Xtreme Broncs= First approved by the PRCA in 2016, this tour features only saddle bronc riding competition. Like the Xtreme Bulls tour, these events are held in conjunction with a very small amount of the PRCA‚Äôs several hundreds of annual regular season rodeos. At the Xtreme Broncs Tour Finale, held every August since 2019 in Rapid City, South Dakota, the top 12 saddle bronc riders in the PRCA world standings, plus the top 12 saddle bronc riders in the Xtreme Broncs tour standings not already in the top 12 PRCA world standings compete for the chance of winning the tour title. Money won on the Xtreme Broncs tour counts towards the PRCA world standings for the National Finals Rodeo. =National Circuit Finals Rodeo= A competitor must qualify in his or her regional circuit to move on to the National Circuit Finals Rodeo (NCFR). The top two contestants in each of the seven rodeo events from the 12 different PRCA regional American circuits and two international circuits (the Mexico Circuit and Canada‚Äôs Maple Leaf Circuit) compete in the four-day championship event. Points are achieved for the top competitors in each of the circuit rodeo events held throughout the year. The winner in each event at the NCFR is the national circuit finals champion for that event. In addition to the eight individual event winners, there is also an overall champion titled the All-Around Cowboy. All eight winners receive the National Circuit Finals Rodeo Championship gold belt-buckle. The NCFR was held every spring from 1987 to 2010 in Pocatello, Idaho, before moving to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 2011, Guthrie, Oklahoma, in 2014 and then to Kissimmee, Florida, in 2015. In 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the NCFR had to be moved to a different date and location. It was ultimately held in Greeley, Colorado in September. The event itself was closed to the public and the seats were filled with socially distanced cardboard cutouts of people. 2018 PRCA Media Guide\\"Circuit Information and Records\\", 2018 RAM National Circuit Finals Rodeo, pp. 438-558. =National Circuit Finals Steer Roping= A few days after the completion of the National Circuit Finals Rodeo (NCFR) in Kissimmee, Florida, a different event, the National Circuit Finals Steer Roping (NCFSR), takes place in Torrington, Wyoming. The top 35 steer ropers from the 12 PRCA regional American circuits compete at the annual two-day event for the chance of winning the National Circuit Steer Roping title.2018 PRCA Media Guide\\"Circuit Information and Records\\", 2018 RAM National Circuit Finals Rodeo, pp. 438-445, 454-456. =National Finals Steer Roping= At the end of the regular season, the top 15 steer ropers in the PRCA world standings compete at the National Finals Steer Roping (NFSR). This annual event held every November in Mulvane, Kansas, is separate from the National Finals Rodeo (NFR) and different from the National Circuit Finals Steer Roping (NCFSR). After two days of competition, the contestant who has won the most money throughout the season, including at the NFSR is crowned the PRCA world champion steer roper. The event is named after the legendary PRCA rodeo announcer Clem McSpadden.2018 PRCA Media Guide\\" \\"Clem McSpadden National Finals Steer Roping, p. 355. =Permit Member of the Year Challenge= The top five permit holders in each of the seven standard rodeo events at the end of the regular season compete at the PRCA Permit Member of the Year Challenge. This one-day event is held every December at the South Point Hotel Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, just a few days before the National Finals Rodeo. First time PRCA members compete on a permit, and must win a certain amount of money before they earn their full-time PRCA membership card. The top five money- earning permit holders compete in two rounds each and the ones who have earned the most money throughout the year are each crowned the PRCA Permit Member of the Year. 2018 PRCA Media Guide\\" \\"Wrangler NFR Records and History\\" NFR Permit-Member Challenge, p. 358. =National Finals Rodeo= The top 15 money winners in each PRCA discipline (including the top 15 \\"headers\\" and \\"heelers\\" in team roping) at the end of the regular season earn a trip to the National Finals Rodeo, commonly called the National Finals or NFR. The NFR is held in Las Vegas, Nevada, every December. Rodeo action is held over 10 consecutive days at the National Finals, with the top money winner for the year crowned the year's PRCA World Champion in each discipline at the end of the NFR. Because of the large amount of money (10 million dollars) at stake in the NFR, the leaders in each event going into the NFR are often dethroned for the year's championship at that event.National Finals Rodeo\\", About the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo, p. 326. * In 2006 the Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame inducted the PRCA into its hall of fame. Events 7 events and 10 championships are sanctioned by the PRCA: Steer roping is publicized separately and its finals are held separately at the Clem McSpadden National Finals Steer Roping. Barrel racing is sanctioned by the WPRA. * Bronc Riding - there are two divisions in rodeo, Bareback Bronc Riding, where the rider is only allowed to hang onto a bucking horse with a type of surcingle called a \\"rigging\\"; and Saddle Bronc Riding, where the rider uses a specialized western saddle without a horn (for safety) and hangs onto a heavy lead rope, called a bronc rein, which is attached to a halter on the horse. * Tie-Down Roping - also called calf roping, is based on ranch work in which calves are roped for branding, medical treatment, or other purposes. It is the oldest of rodeo's timed events. The cowboy ropes a running calf around the neck with a lariat, and his horse stops and sets back on the rope while the cowboy dismounts, runs to the calf, throws it to the ground and ties three feet together. (If the calf falls when roped, the cowboy must lose time waiting for the calf to get back to its feet so that the cowboy can do the work.) The job of the horse is to hold the calf steady on the rope. A well-trained calf-roping horse will slowly back up while the cowboy ties the calf, to help keep the lariat snug. * Steer Wrestling - Also known as \\"Bulldogging,\\" is a rodeo event where the rider jumps off his horse onto a Corriente steer and 'wrestles' it to the ground by grabbing it by the horns. This is probably the single most physically dangerous event in rodeo for the cowboy, who runs a high risk of jumping off a running horse head first and missing the steer, or of having the thrown steer land on top of him, sometimes horns first. * Team Roping - also called \\"heading and heeling,\\" is the only rodeo event where men and women riders compete together. Two people capture and restrain a full-grown steer. One horse and rider, the \\"header,\\" lassos a running steer's horns, while the other horse and rider, the \\"heeler,\\" lassos the steer's two hind legs. Once the animal is captured, the riders face each other and lightly pull the steer between them, so that both ropes are taut. This technique originated from methods of capture and restraint for treatment used on a ranch. * Bull Riding - an event where the cowboys ride full-grown bulls instead of horses. Although skills and equipment similar to those needed for bareback bronc riding are required, the event differs considerably from horse riding competition due to the danger involved. Because bulls are unpredictable and may attack a fallen rider, rodeo clowns, now known as \\"bullfighters\\", work during bull-riding competition to distract the bulls and help prevent injury to competitors. * Steer Roping - is based on tie-down roping. Instead of a calf, the cowboy must catch and tie down a large steer (approximately 450 to 600 pounds). Unlike tie-down roping, the cowboy must first rope the steer around its horns. The steer's horns are wrapped and then reinforced with rebar. The cowboy must then toss the rope over the steer's right hip. Then he rides leftward which brings the steer down to the ground. Once the steer is on his side and the rope is tight, then he can dismount. He will run to the steer in order to tie any three legs together. As in tie-down roping, the tie must hold for six seconds.2018 PRCA Media Guide\\" \\"Introduction, Event descriptions, p. 17. * All-Around - The All-Around is actually an award, not an event. It is awarded to the highest money winner in two or more events. * Barrel Racing - is a timed speed and agility event. In barrel racing, horse and rider gallop around a cloverleaf pattern of barrels, making agile turns without knocking the barrels over. In professional, collegiate and high school rodeo, barrel racing is an exclusively women's sport, though men and boys occasionally compete at local O-Mok-See competition. Barrel racing takes place with other PRCA sanctioned events, but it is sanctioned by the WPRA. Results are shown on that website. Television & streaming Throughout its history, PRCA events were televised on channels such as ESPN, TNN, the Outdoor Life Network, the Outdoor Channel, Fox Sports Networks, Great American Country, MAVTV and CBS Sports Network. As of 2020, PRCA events are televised live on The Cowboy Channel and streamed live on The Cowboy Channel Plus application.

Early life Jacobson is the daughter of William G. and Dawn (n√©e Trbovich) Salatich. She is of serbian descent In 1965 she graduated from the University of New Hampshire with a degree in English. That same year she married Army officer William D. Jacobson. During her husband's military career, Jacobson held a civilian job in Thailand. The Jacobsons divorced in 1973. Career William Jacobson's military career ended in 1969 and the couple moved to Boston. She wanted to go into journalism, but was unable to find work in the field. She eventually got an interview with independent station WKBG (now WLVI-TV), but was not hired. However, she was later chosen to be the station's public affairs director. She moved to WBZ-TV as an off-camera producer after WKBG eliminated its public affairs division. On March 19, 1972, Jacobson joined newly-formed WCVB-TV as a reporter. There she met news anchor Chet Curtis, whom she married in May 1975. In 1976 she became the first female anchor of a Boston evening newscast in when she began co-anchoring WCVB's 6 p.m. newscasts. In 1978 she began anchoring the 11 p.m. newscasts with Tom Ellis. In 1982 she and Curtis began a 17-year pairing as co-anchors of the station's 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts.\\"Chet Curtis, longtime Boston TV news anchor, dies at 74\\", The Boston Globe; retrieved January 25, 2014.

Her 1990 interview with Democratic gubernatorial nominee John Silber became notable after Silber's outburst when Jacobson asked him to describe his weaknesses. Silber's lead in the polls vanished after the interview and he lost the race to William Weld. On December 14, 1999, Jacobson and Curtis announced that they were divorcing. WCVB split up the Curtis/Jacobson pairing in July 2000. Curtis was moved to Sunday's 11 p.m. newscast and street reporting and soon departed WCVB for NECN. Jacobson scaled back her work. She anchored the 6 p.m. newscasts solo until March 2007, when she was joined by Ed Harding. Curtis and Jacobson's divorce was finalized in 2001. On July 10, 2007, Jacobson announced that she would leave WCVB-TV. Her last newscast was on July 18, 2007.

The facility is located in east central Kentucky, southeast of the cities of Lexington and Richmond, Kentucky. The site, composed mainly of open fields and wooded areas, is used for munitions storage, repair of general supplies, and the disposal of munitions. The installation is used for the storage of conventional explosive munitions as well as assembled chemical weapons. The depot primarily is involved in industrial and related activities associated with the storage and maintenance of conventional and chemical munitions. The tenant organization, Blue Grass Chemical Activity, is responsible for the chemical weapons stored at BGAD. BGCA is part of the Army's Chemical Materials Activity, headquartered in Edgewood, Maryland. The demilitarization of the chemical weapons is the responsibility of a third organization, Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives (ACWA). BGAD provides munitions, chemical defense equipment, and ammunition support to the joint warfighter. It is the Department of Defense's primary center for surveillance, receipt, storage, issue, testing and minor repair for the Chemical Defense Equipment Program. BGAD maintains and supports CDE stocks for deploying units and homeland defense forces, and is a training site for reserve component and other deploying units. Capabilities Capabilities include: industrial services support; ammunition maintenance, renovation, disassembly and demilitarization; thermal arc coating for Air Force bombs; water washout facility with flaker belt; molten salt research and development; ultrasonic testing for mortar ammunition; chemical material surveillance; quality assurance and joint logistics support; and ammunition life cycle management. The depot also serves as a training ground for service members. History BGAD was established in 1941 and began operations in 1942 as an ammunition and general supply storage depot, Blue Grass Ordnance Depot. In 1964, it merged with the Lexington Signal Depot in Avon, Kentucky, to become the Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot. The Lexington facility was selected for closure under BRAC (Base Realignment And Closure); after it closed in September 1999, the remaining facility received its current designation. Facilities BGAD is housed on with 1,153 buildings, 902 igloos and storage capacity of . BGAD manufactures combat lock tools, which are a multipurpose key that allows war fighters access to MRAPs other than their own in the case of an emergency. Impact of Base Realignment and Closure BGAD will be gaining the maintenance workload from Red River Munitions Center, which is closing under Base Realignment and Closure 2005. Environmental BGAD is currently working with state and federal regulators on environmental remediation. The installation is in compliance with all state and federal laws and regulations. Chemical weapons destruction BGAD stores a small stockpile of chemical agents, comprising of nerve agents GB (sarin) and VX, and mustard gas, or about two percent of the United States chemical weapons stockpile. Beginning in 2003, destruction of the Blue Grass chemical weapons stockpile, in accordance with the Chemical Weapons Treaty, was contracted out using a technology known as neutralization followed by supercritical water oxidation. This is a different method than the incineration that is used at the larger stockpiles. Groundbreaking for the chemical destruction facility took place on October 28, 2006. Final design of the facilities should be complete in 2010 and actual construction in 2018, after which destruction of the weapons will begin.

It takes its origins in the Rapa family of Porto Mantovano located in Province of Mantua, Italy. Earliest history Recorded evidence concerning the names of Rapa or Rappe ha-Kohen(-Tzedeq (Rapa Katz)) date from about 1450, when Meshullam KU.S.i (abbreviated from \\"Jekuthiel\\") Rapa ha-Kohen Tzedeq, the earliest known member of the family, lived on the Rhine, probably in Mainz. Several decades later the family disappeared from Germany, probably on account of the Jews' expulsion from Mainz on October 29, 1462. In 1467, in Mestre, near Venice, the wealthy Chayyim Rappe is found as alms collector for the poor of the Holy Land. In Venice, the physician R. Moses Rap was exempted in 1475 from wearing the Jew's badge. In the middle of the 16th century there appeared in Italy a Kohenitic family of the name of Porto. On March 18, 1540, R. Isaac Porto ha-Kohen obtained from the Duke of Mantua permission to build an Ashkenazic synagogue. The name of the family was not derived from the Portuguese city of Porto, nor from the Bavarian city of F√ºrth as some authors have suggested, but instead from Porto, near Mantua, where the above-named Isaac Porto ha-Kohen lived. An alliance between the Rabe and Porto families explains the combination of the two family names in Rapoport; in 1565, officiating in the above-mentioned synagogue of Mantua, there is found a Rabbi Solomon ben Menahem ha-Kohen Rapa of Venice, while a Rabbi Abraham Porto ha-Kohen (1541‚Äì76) was parnas of the community. During the same time period, a branch of the family settled in Prague in central Europe, as evidenced by burials with the name Porta in 1589 and Port in 1598.Beider, A., Jewish Surnames in Prague, Avotaynu, Inc., 1995, , p. 17 Eastern European branches raven and hands in the form of a priestly blessing. The Polish branch of the family explains its name through the following legend: one Easter a certain Jew, to prevent his enemies from smuggling the body of a Christian child into his house, closed all possible entrances and openings except the chimney. Down the chimney however, the dreaded corpse fell, but when a crowd stormed the house nothing but a partridge (Old German, \\"Rephuhn\\" or \\"Raphuhn\\") was found in the fireplace. But the \\"Von den Jungen Raben\\" (the house shield name of Judengasse \\"From the young crow (cf. raven)\\") in the signature of Abraham Menahem ha-Kohen Rapa von Port at the end of his Pentateuch commentary, and the additional fact that the coat of arms of the family bears a raven, clearly show that signifies \\"Rabe\\" (Middle High German, \\"Rappe\\"). The family name, therefore, at the end of the 16th century seems to be clearly established as Ha-Kohen Rabe. Part of the Polish branch changed their name into Wrona, which is Polish for crow. Another possibility is that these Wrona originated from Verona in Italy. The Yiddish (or Hebrew) transcription of Wrona and Verona are identical (waw resh waw nun he). By the middle of the 17th century authors belonging to the Rapa-Port family were living in Poland and Lithuania, the name having meanwhile undergone the following modifications: Rapiport, Rapoport, Rapperport, and Rappert. The family spread principally from Cracow and Lemberg (Lviv); in the latter place, in 1584, was born the famous Talmudist Abraham Rapoport (called also Schrenzel). In 1650 Rapoports lived in Dubno and Krzemeniec; in the 18th century descendants of R. Judah Rapoport are found in Smyrna and Jerusalem. About 1750 there were two Rapoports in Dyhernfurth (Silesia): one named Israel Moses and the other R. Me√Ør; the former came from Pi≈Ñcz√≥w, the latter from Krotoschin. Both found employment in the printing establishment at Dyhernfurth. A notable scholar of this branch included R. Hayyim Rappaport son of Rabbi Simcha Rappaport who lived in Lviv and died there in 1771. He was one of the key \\"talmudists\\" involved in the Frankist debates set up by the Archbishop Dembowski in 1757. R. Khaim's descendants include the Rapoport-Bick dynasty. R. Khaim's pedigree is known from his personal and his descendants' writings.

The genre emerged in early 1990s when black metal bands began incorporating elements of death metal and vice versa. The genre typically employs death growls, tremolo picking, blast beats, and Satanic lyrics and imagery. Bands of the genre typically employ corpse paint, which was adapted from black metal. Characteristics Orion, bassist of Behemoth performing 2009. The genre is commonly death metal that incorporates musical, lyrical or ideological elements of black metal, such as an increased use of tremolo picking, anti- Christian or Satanic lyrical themes and chord progressions similar to those used in black metal. Blackened death metal bands are also more likely to wear corpse paint and suits of armour, than bands from other styles of death metal. Lower range guitar tunings, death growls and abrupt tempo changes are common in the genre. Some blackened death metal bands, such as Goatwhore and Angelcorpse, even take significant influence from thrash metal. History Both black metal and death metal evolved out of the same crop of early extreme metal bands such as Dark Angel, Possessed, Kreator, Sodom, Venom, Celtic Frost and Bathory, leading to common elements between the genres being in place, early death metal groups with some elements common in black metal include early-Sepultura, Morbid Angel and Deicide. Along with this, John McEntee, guitarist and vocalist of death metal band Incantation, has noted that he and his band draw influence from black metal. Seminal black metal band Darkthrone began playing death metal, before moving into the style they became primarily known for. Blasphemy crossed death metal and black metal on their debut album Fallen Angel of Doom, giving way to the development of war metal. Dissection evolved out of the Gothenburg melodic death metal scene, embracing black metal influences into their music and helping create melodic black-death thanks to their 1993 album The Somberlain. The year 1998 saw the release of Behemoth's album Pandemonic Incantations, striking a stylistic change in the sound of the band's output from a traditional black metal style with generally pagan lyrical themes into a more death metal influenced sound with lyrics about the occult and Satan. After continuing this style, their 2000 album Thelema.6 peaked at number 31 on the Polish Albums Charts. Many of Behemoth's subsequent albums would continue to chart, with Demigod peaking at number 15, The Apostasy at number 9 and Evangelion and The Satanist both at number one, with multiple albums charting worldwide. American band Skeletonwitch's third, fourth and fifth albums peaked at numbers 151, 153 and 62, respectively, on the Billboard 200 charts. Thy Art Is Murder, a band who previously played deathcore, moved into a style more similar to blackened death metal on their fourth album Dear Desolation, charting in eight different territories, including a peak at number five on the Australian Albums Charts and number seven on the New Zealand Heatseekers Albums. As well as New Jersey's Lorna Shore also beginning to tread similarly into the grounds of blackened death metal on their sophomore album \\"Flesh Coffin\\". Stylistic divisions =Melodic black-death= Melodic black-death (also known as blackened melodic death metal or melodic blackened death metal) is a genre of extreme metal that describes the style created when melodic death metal bands began being inspired by black metal and European romanticism. However, unlike most other black metal, this take on the genre would incorporate an increased sense of melody and narrative. Some bands who have played this style include Dissection, Sacramentum, Embraced, Naglfar, God Dethroned, Satariel, Throes of Dawn, Obscurity, Dawn, Cries of the Past-era Underoath, Catamenia, Midvinter, Twin Obscenity, Nokturnal Mortum Unanimated, Epoch of Unlight, This Ending, Suidakra, Oathean, Thulcandra, Skeletonwitch and Cardinal Sin. Sweden's Dissection evolved alongside melodic death metal bands such as At the Gates and In Flames, by building upon the musical foundation laid by death metal and incorporating guitar melodies and harmonies amongst the standard brutality of the genre. However, unlike the other bands, Dissection began incorporating influences from black metal into their music, which lead to their debut album The Somberlain influencing a plethora of subsequent bands and Metal Injection dubbing them \\"one of the most important extreme metal bands of all time\\". Sacramentum's debut and second albums Far Away from the Sun and The Coming of Chaos would then continue Dissection's style of black metal-infused melodic death metal, based around middle of the neck guitar riffing and howling vocals, while Vinterland would lean even more upon their black metal predecessors like Norway's Emperor. Naglfar would base their sound primarily within that of Gothenburg metal bands like In Flames and Dark Tranquility, by taking a brighter and thrashier take on the style. =War metal= Pioneering war metal band Blasphemy performing in 2017.

For analogous portrayals of the Lamanites as savages, see 2 Nephi 5:24; Jarom 1:6; Moroni 9:9‚Äì10\\" Book of Mormon Narrative According to the Book of Mormon, around 600 BC, several families of Israelites were led by God from the Jerusalem area to the western hemisphere. Shortly after arriving, the group split into a righteous faction called the Nephites and a wicked faction called the Lamanites. To distinguish between the two, God cursed the Lamanites, causing \\"a skin of blackness\\" so they would \\"not be enticing\\". Around 92 BC, four sons of the Nephite King, named Ammon, Aaron, Omner, and Himni, went on a mission with a small group of others to the Lamanites to convert them to Christianity. A significant number of Lamanites converted to Christianity, banded together and took the name Anti-Nephi-Lehies, rejecting the name Lamanite. The king of the newly formed people died, and his son becomes king, changing his name to Anti-Nephi-Lehi (note: the pronouns in the English translation make it unclear if Anti-Nephi-Lehi chose this name for himself or it was given him by his father). Fearful of returning to their past sins and as a sign of their covenant with God, they gathered their weapons, buried them, and committed to being pacifists and friendly with the Nephites. God then lifted their curse of dark skin. The wicked portion of the Lamanites attacked Anti-Nephi-Lehies, but they did not attack back, instead allowed themselves to be killed while prostrate in prayer. After 1,005 had been killed, the Lamanites felt guilty and stopped attacking. Many of the Lamanites then joined the Anti-Nephi-Lehies. Others were rallied by dissident Nephites to attack the Nephites but are repelled. To avoid further attacks on them, God commanded Ammon to lead the group to join the Nephites, and they changed their name to the People of Ammon or Ammonites. They were given the Land of Jershon by the Nephites. When an anti-christ named Korihor tried to teach atheism to the Ammonites, they bound him and took him to the high priest. =Stripling Warriors= In a subsequent war between the Nephites and Lamanites, when the Ammonites saw how the Nephite army suffered in defending them, they considered breaking their oath to lay down their weapons and defend themselves; a Nephite prophet named Helaman persuaded them not to break their oath. Two thousand of their sons (who had been too young at the time to have made the pacifist covenant) volunteered to fight for the defense of the Nephites and the Ammonites. The young men asked Helaman to be their commander. The young stripling warriors fought alongside the Nephite army and were one of the Nephites' most effective military units. Though every soldier was wounded at one time or another, there were no fatalities among the warriors. Helaman attributed this to the upbringing provided by their mothers and the great faith they exhibited. The original 2,000 \\"sons of Helaman\\" were later joined by sixty more, making a total of 2,060. The last time the people of Ammon are mentioned in the Book of Mormon, a large portion of them migrated to the \\"land northward\\" sometime between 49 and 39 BC.

In 1880s, during the height of the United States government crackdown on the LDS Church practice of polygamy, church leader George Reynolds gave the first serious interpretation, by using the Anti-Nephi-Lehi story of passive submission to Lamanite armies as an object lesson to support the church's policy of civil disobedience being both moral and effective. His writings were later incorporated into education materials.George Reynolds, ‚ÄúHistory of the Book of Mormon: Contents of the Records, II,‚Äù Contributor 5/3 (December 1883); =Usage from 1900 to 1950= Though pacifism was not an official doctrine, in the first half of the 20th century there was a significant strain of pacifism within the LDS Church. In the 1920s, LDS Church scholar Janne Sjodahl and author John Henry Evans both used the example of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies complete rejection of violence as a matter of superior moral principle.Janne M. Sj√∂dahl, An Introduction to the Study of the Book of Mormon (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1927), 268‚Äì70John Henry Evans, Messages and Characters of the Book of Mormon (Salt Lake City: printed by author, 1929), 207‚Äì8. In 1935, the official Sunday School curriculum said of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies that \\"there is a suggestion in the Record that it is better to take a pacific stand in time of war,\\" and concluded with \\"our attitude, then, toward war should be to avoid it when and if we can.\\"Deseret Sunday School Union, Book of Mormon Sunday School Lessons (Salt Lake City: Deseret Sunday School Union, 1935), 88‚Äì89. The 1939 manual, on the eve of World War II advocated clearly for pacifism, > \\"There is no place in a Christian life for war....If one should question the > wisdom of the decision of the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi made on the occasion > of this lesson, let him remember that they did as a nation what Jesus did as > an individual when he gave his life for mankind ... there was something > 'godlike' in the decision of both Jesus and the Lamanites to sacrifice their > mortal existence that the standards of righteousness might be preserved. > ...The people of Ammon would rather be slaughtered than to take the life of > another in their own defense. The Nephites on the other hand justified their > defense of their families and liberties on the ground that it was the will > of God that these things be preserved.

After the beginning of World War II church manuals commended Anti-Nephi-Lehies for their righteousness, but did not imply pacifism as being superior, instead using the story as part of the definition for what constitutes a just war. =Usage from 1950 to 1980= In 1950, Professor William E. Berrett wrote a critique of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies as part of his study of the Book of Mormon that would become a dominant narrative for the next several decades, calling their pacifist actions, \\"an interesting experiment in non-resistance\\" but ultimately not effective. \\"Although the Anti-Nephi-Lehies received a short respite it was not long before it became apparent that to save their lives they must flee to the land of the Nephites and be protected by Nephite arms.\\"William E. Berrett, Teacher‚Äôs Supplement: Teachings of the Book of Mormon (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1950), 34. The LDS Church translated Berrett's book into several languages, and it became the Melchizedek Priesthood manual in 1962, and appointed Berrett as vice president of Brigham Young University, giving him responsibility over high school and college age church curriculum's.William E. Berrett, Teachings of the Book of Mormon (Salt Lake City: Council of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1962)Eldin Ricks gave another view critical of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies at almost the same time as Berrett. Eldin Ricks, Book of Mormon Study Guide (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1955). The Anti-Nephi- Lehi vow of non-violence came to be seen as an anomaly, applicable only in rare circumstances, and discussion of the topic in manuals usually included examples that justified armed self-resistance. Although a strain of pacifism existed within the LDS Church that used the Anti-Nephi-Lehies as an example, pacifist ethics have not been part of Church Education System curriculum since that time. Brigham Young University professor Hugh Nibley was representative of the exception, speaking out against war and using the Anti-Nephi-Lehies as pacifist examples worthy of emulating.Hugh Nibley, Since Cumorah, 2nd ed. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book and FARMS, 1988), 295‚Äì96; see also ‚ÄúFreemen and King-men in the Book of Mormon,‚Äù in The Prophetic Book of Mormon (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book and FARMS, 1989), 356; and ‚ÄúLeaders to Managers: The Fatal Shift,‚Äù in Brother Brigham Challenges the Saints (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book and FARMS, 1994), 499. The critical interpretation of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies decision to be killed rather than fight was notable in that it coincided with the a significant segment of the church that opposed the Civil Rights Movement and the tactic of civil disobedience in particular.Pulsipher, J.

His interpretation is defining, and was part of a trend towards a 'muscular' interpretation of the Book of Mormon. In the 1950s, artist Arnold Friberg was commissioned to paint 12 scenes from the Book of Mormon for children, and chose for one of his scenes the Stripling Warriors. His interpretation became enormously popular and for many decades \\"tended to sweep aside alternative artistic concepts\\".Swanson, Vern (2001) \\"The Book of Mormon Art of Arnold Friberg: Painter of Scripture,\\" Journal of Book of Mormon Studies: Vol. 10 : No. 1, Article 8. Available at: https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/jbms/vol10/iss1/8 His painting of the young men became iconic, and has been printed in millions of copies of the Book of Mormon, and remains popular in Latter Day Saint culture. Of the painting Friberg said, > \\"They call them striplings‚Äîsome say, 'the Boy Scout army.' No! No! They were > young men. They were like David.

David Pulsipher notes that the Friberg's interpretation was part of \\"an increasing tendency toward 'muscular' interpretations of the Book of Mormon, a trend exemplified by Ezra Taft Benson's reading of the text.\\" =Modern usage from 1980 to the present= Beginning in the early 1980s, manuals of the LDS Church began to emphasize the metaphorical value of the story. Rather than commenting on the political morality of war, the Anti- Nephi-Lehies were used as examples of repentance and deep commitment that should be emulated in individual lives by \\"burying\\" sins in an equally permanent way.Book of Mormon Seminary Teacher Outline (Salt Lake City: Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1982), 161. This interpretation is what historian Dan Vogel feels is the intended message of the Book of Mormon. Vogel, D. (2004). Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet. Signature Books. e-book location 8365 of 19201 In 1983, the LDS Church commissioned artist Del Parson to paint the story of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies burying their swords, and widely distributed it in educational material.Parson, Del The Anti-Nephi- Lehies Burying Their Swords Gospel Media online at: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media-library/images/anti-nephi-lehies- bury-weapons-39657?lang=eng The painting was at the forefront of the shift towards the metaphorical usage of the story, depicting an Anti-Nephi-Lehi man kneeling and raising his sword toward heaven, as though presenting an offering of his sins to God. Using the story for its metaphorical applications has today become the dominant approach in the LDS Church, as exemplified by a 2014 Sunday School lesson for children, where students were instructed to mimic the Anti-Nephi-Lehies by writing on paper swords, \\"a wrong choice ... such as 'fighting with my brother' or 'telling a lie.\\" These paper swords were then \\"buried ... by crumpling their papers or throwing them away.\\"Families Are Forever: 2014 Outline for Sharing Time (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2013), 23. In 2016, LDS Church owned newspaper the Deseret News printed an editorial using the story of the Nephites accepting the Anti-Nephi-Lehies into their country to promote the ethic of assisting refugees migrating to Europe.Frederickson, K.

Etymology of Names The name Anti-Nephi-Lehi has confused some as the prefix \\"anti\\" implies that they are against Nephi-Lehi. A textual clue occurs in Alma 23:16 which says the name was taken to be \\"distinguished from their brethren [the Lamanites]\\". There are several speculations as to the meaning of the name: * A common interpretation is that \\"Anti\\" means \\"Not\\" instead of \\"Against\\", rendering the name to mean \\"Not descendants of Nephi, but of Lehi\\".Kent P. Jackson and Darrell L. Matthews, \\"The Lamanite Converts Firm in the Faith,\\" in Studies in Scripture: Book of Mormon, Part 1, pp. 337‚Äì339 * Historian Dan Vogel notes that in the Book of Mormon, the land of Lehi-Nephi was a region where Limhi's people had been kept captive before rebelling and escaping. Thus adopting the name Anti- Nephi-Lehi was a way of symbolizing their own rebellion against traditional Lamanite ways, or becoming anti-Lamanite.Vogel, D. (2004). Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet. Signature Books. e-book location 8365 of 19201 LDS Church scholars who believe the Book of Mormon was written in a language related to Egyptian with Hebraic influences suggest further potential meanings: * Hugh Nibley suggested that \\"Anti\\" may be a reflex of the Egyptian \\"nty:\\", he of, the one of. Thus, rather than having the sense \\"against\\", it may have the meaning \\"the one of Nephi and Lehi\\".Hugh Nibley, Quoted in Eldin Ricks, Book of Mormon Study Guide, p. 63. as cited in Ludlow, A Companion to Your Study of the Book of Mormon, 209‚Äì210 * Hugh Nibley further suggested that it could have semitic origins and mean \\"Nephi brought face to face with other descendents of Lehi\\".Hugh W. Nibley, Teachings of the Book of Mormon, Semester 2, p. 428 * John Gee, Brian M. Hauglid and Paul Hoskisson suggest the name is a transliteration.Hoskisson, Paul Y.; Hauglid, Brian M.; and Gee, John (2002) \\"What's in a Name?

Literary Analysis The missionary Ammon, who plays a major part in the conversion of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies, is used as an example of a larger criticism and theme of the Book of Mormon, that its main characters are often portrayed as extremes of either uncompromisingly good, or unsurpassingly evil.Chandler, Neal Book of Mormon Stories That My Teachers Kept from Me Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, Vol. 24, No. 4 (Winter 1991), pp. 13‚Äì30 Published by: University of Illinois Press Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/45227863 The conversion and unwavering faith of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies mirrors and is used as a contrast with the wickedness of Nephite dissenters who move in the opposite direction and live with the Lamanites (i.e. Zoramites and Amalickiah).Hardy, G. (2010). Understanding the Book of Mormon a readers guide. New York: Oxford University Press. Several modern day historians believe that later sections of the Book of Mormon clearly indicate that rather than advocating for pacifism, the rejection of violence was more about complete commitment to God at all costs. The Anti- Nephi-Lehies adopted pacifism as a covenant with God that they would distance themselves from their prior murderous habits, but did not generalize this requirement to others including their children.\\"Were the Ammonites Pacifists?\\" Duane Boyce, Journal of Book of Mormon Studies 18, no. 1 found online at different source:https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/the-ammonites-were- not-pacifists/ The language that is used when the Lord commands the Anti- Nephi-Lehies to leave the Lamanite lands and go to the Nephite lands is identical in parts to an earlier section in the Book of Mormon where a prophet Alma is commanded to take his group of Nephite slaves out of the Lamanite lands. In both, the commandment reads, \\"Get this people out of this land, ... therefore, get thee out of this land.\\" The attack on the Nephites that is sparked by the aborted attack on the Anti-Nephi-Lehies is described in two different narrative strands, once in Alma 16:6‚Äì9 and the other time in Alma 25:3, and 27:1. There is an inconsistency between the two accounts; in the first account the Lamanites are driven back after one great battle, while in the second there are \\"many battles\\". Of the discrepancy, LDS Church Book of Mormon Scholar Grant Hardy writes that this might be an example of the narrator \\"trying not to unduly burden his narrative with unnecessary details,\\" and that one version is presented for historical reasons while the other is to promote a spiritual message. The text of the Book of Mormon notes that hundreds of the stripling warriors \\"fainted because of blood\\". Surgeon Robert Patterson observed of the miracle that \\"the epic tale of the stripling warriors and their miraculous recovery from life-threatening trauma would appear, to the rational mind, highly unlikely or even outright impossible. Hundreds of people, even fit young males, simply do not get up and walk away after experiencing Class 4 hypovolemic shock. Perhaps even Joseph Smith, uneducated as he was, did not appreciate the improbability of Helaman's narrative.\\" =Criticism= A major theme and stated purpose of the Book of Mormon, is the conversion of the modern day Lamanite descendants to Christianity.McBride, M.

Salt Lake City, UT: Signature Books page 35. online at http://signaturebookslibrary.org/indian- origins-and-the-book-of-mormon-03/ There is agreement in academia that the characterization within the Book of Mormon of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies before and after their conversion is consistent with a eurocentric viewpoint of Native Americans endemic to 1820s New England.Richard L. Bushman, Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 97‚Äì98For an opposing view that the Book of Mormon does not simply regurgitate common racial ideas, see Michael Jensen, \\"'As a Lion among Beasts': Squaring Mormon Views of the Indian with Those of Nineteenth-Century White America,\\" in Archive of Restoration Culture: Summer Fellows' Papers, 1997‚Äì1999, ed. Richard Lyman Bushman (Provo, UT: Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Latter-day Saint History, 2000), 177‚Äì82. In line with prevailing views of Native Americans in the late 1820s, the Book of Mormon portrays Lamanites as, \\"wild and ferocious, and blood- thirsty people, full of idolatry and filthiness.\\" After their conversion, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies reflect the eurocentric, or Nephite ideal: \\"they were brought to believe in the traditions of the Nephites ... they did lay down the weapons of their rebellion ... they began to be a very industrious people; yea, and they were friendly with the Nephites; therefore, they did open a correspondence with them, and the curse of God did no more follow them.\\"See this him by W.

The MeSH definition reads: \\"A well- characterized neutral peptide believed to be secreted by the liver and to circulate in the blood. It has growth-regulating, insulin-like and mitogenic activities. The growth factor has a major, but not absolute, dependence on somatotropin. It is believed to be a major fetal growth factor in contrast to Insulin-like growth factor 1, which is a major growth factor in adults.\\"  Gene structure  In humans, the IGF2 gene is located on chromosome 11p15.5, a region which contains numerous imprinted genes. In mice this homologous region is found at distal chromosome 7. In both organisms, Igf2 is imprinted, with expression resulting favourably from the paternally inherited allele. However, in some human brain regions a loss of imprinting occurs resulting in both IGF2 and H19 being transcribed from both parental alleles. The protein CTCF is involved in repressing expression of the gene, by binding to the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) along with Differentially-methylated Region-1 (DMR1) and Matrix Attachment Region ‚àí3 (MAR3). These three DNA sequences bind to CTCF in a way that limits downstream enhancer access to the Igf2 region. The mechanism in which CTCF binds to these regions is currently unknown, but could include either a direct DNA-CTCF interaction or it could possibly be mediated by other proteins. In mammals (mice, humans, pigs), only the allele for insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) inherited from one's father is active; that inherited from the mother is not ‚Äî a phenomenon called imprinting. The mechanism: the mother's allele has an insulator between the IGF2 promoter and enhancer. So does the father's allele, but in his case, the insulator has been methylated. CTCF can no longer bind to the insulator, and so the enhancer is now free to turn on the father's IGF2 promoter.  Function  The major role of IGF-2 is as a growth promoting hormone during gestation. IGF-2 exerts its effects by binding to the IGF-1 receptor and to the short isoform of the insulin receptor (IR-A or exon 11-). IGF2 may also bind to the IGF-2 receptor (also called the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor), which acts as a signalling antagonist; that is, to prevent IGF2 responses. In the process of folliculogenesis, IGF-2 is created by thecal cells to act in an autocrine manner on the theca cells themselves, and in a paracrine manner on granulosa cells in the ovary. IGF2 promotes granulosa cell proliferation during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, acting alongside follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). . After ovulation has occurred, IGF-2 promotes progesterone secretion during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, together with luteinizing hormone (LH). Thus, IGF2 acts as a co-hormone together with both FSH and LH. . A study at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine found that IGF-2 may be linked to memory and reproduction. A study at the European Neuroscience Institute-Goettingen (Germany) found that fear extinction-induced IGF2/IGFBP7 signalling promotes the survival of 17- to 19-day-old newborn hippocampal neurons. This suggests that therapeutic strategies that enhance IGF2 signalling and adult neurogenesis might be suitable to treat diseases linked to excessive fear memory such as PTSD.  Clinical relevance  It is sometimes produced in excess in islet cell tumors and non-islet hypoglycemic cell tumors, causing hypoglycemia. Doege-Potter syndrome is a paraneoplastic syndrome in which hypoglycemia is associated with the presence of one or more non-islet fibrous tumors in the pleural cavity. Loss of imprinting of IGF2 is a common feature in tumors seen in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. As IGF2 promotes development of fetal pancreatic beta cells, it is believed to be related to some forms of diabetes mellitus. Preeclampsia induces a decrease in methylation level at IGF2 demethylated region, and this might be among the mechanisms behind the association between intrauterine exposure to preeclampsia and high risk for metabolic diseases in the later life of the infants.

The low boom caused an \\"end-plate effect\\", which allows a smaller amount of air to circulate around the boom and making the lower part of mainsail more efficient. The success of Intrepid was also the cause of some completely new technical features such as separate keel and a rudder to become popular in many production yachts such as Swan 36.http://sparkmanstephens.blogspot.fi/2011/11/design-1834-intrepid.html America's Cup In 1967 Intrepid was skippered by Emil \\"Bus\\" Mosbacher, and defeated Australian challenger Dame Pattie. Redesigned in 1970 by Britton Chance, Jr. and skippered by Bill Ficker that year, she defeated another Australian challenger, Gretel II. Intrepid remained competitive even against aluminum 12-metre yachts. Redesigned again, this time by her original designer Olin Stephens, Intrepid was back again for a third time in 1974, skippered by Gerry Driscoll. Intrepid came within one race of becoming the only three-time America's Cup defender in history, but lost the final race of the defender trials to Courageous, which would go on to win the Cup that year with Ted Hood at the helm. Ted Hood sold Courageous to Ted Turner who went on to win the 1977 America's Cup with her. Restoration Intrepid underwent a two-year structural restoration, the bustle area was reframed, the bottom replanked for several feet up from the keel, and the deck and deck beams were replaced. Today Intrepid is available for charter out of Newport, Rhode Island along with fellow America's Cup winner Freedom and challenger boat Weatherly.

Historically, it was a rural community, called Tenanitla in the pre-Hispanic period. Its current name is derived from the El Carmen monastery school called San √Ångel M√°rtir. San √Ångel remained a rural community, centered on the monastery until the 19th and 20th centuries, when the monastery was closed and when the area joined urban sprawl of Mexico City. However, the area still contains many of its former historic buildings and El Carmen is one of the most visited museums in the city. It is also home to an annual flower fair called the Feria de las Flores, held since 1856. In 1934, San √Ångel was declared as a Pueblo T√≠pico Pintoresco (Picturesque Typical Town); in 1987, due to presidential order, it was declared historical monument zone. Geography San √Ångel is located in the southwest of the Federal District of Mexico along the southern end of Avenida Insurgentes, bordering the Ciudad Universitaria of UNAM . For most of its history, the area was politically and physically separate from the urban sprawl of Mexico City, becoming part of it around the mid-20th century. The community is surrounded by a volcanic rock bed called the Pedregal, which was formed by the eruption of nearby Xitle Volcano about two thousand years ago. Parts of this volcanic rock bed have been made into protected areas such as the Pedregal de San √Ångel. This area is estimated to have a total of 350 native veined plant species, 100 species of birds, forty species of mammals and twenty of reptiles. The representative plant of the area is called the palo loco (crazy stick) because it blooms in the winter rather than the summer. El Carmen complex Inside the chapel of El Carmen The El Carmen complex is the identifying marker of San √Ångel, especially the three tiled-covered domes of the church. It consists of church, former monastery and school buildings. The monastery school or \\"Colegio\\" was founded in 1613, but the building for it would not begin until two years later. This building was designed by Fray Andr√©s de San Miguel with the first stone laid in 1615, and it was operational in 1617. The school changed its name to Se√±ora de Santa Ana in 1634, but while it retained the official name, it never caught on popularly. The church was built between 1624 and 1626 also dedicated to San √Ångel Mart√≠r. The facade is Herrerian over which is its bell-gable, modeled after that of San Jos√© de √Åvila in Spain. The structure is topped by three domes covered in glazed tile. The entire monastery complex was complete in 1628. It was surrounded by large tracts of gardens and orchards, much of which is now Colonia Chimalistac to the east. These orchards made the monastery wealthy and famous. The monastery and school area came under the custody of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia in 1939 which still maintains it. The current museum was opened in 1955 and is one of the most visited in the city. The museum conserves a number of the monastery's original spaces, such as the dining room, and has one of the most important collections of colonial era art in Mexico, including a permanent exhibition called \\"The Silence of the Carmelites.\\" This traces the history of the order from its origins through images, sculpture, documents, furniture and more. One reason the museum is well-visited is the mummies on display in the basement crypt area. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, one way that the order raised funds for its existence was to set aside crypts for donors from the wealthy families of the area. While many of these bodies would be exhumed after a number of years, with their bones stored in an \\"osorio\\" later, some of the interred here did not completely decompose. Between 1917 and 1918, troops ransacked the convent, looking for treasure. What they found in the crypt area instead were a number of well-preserved, naturally occurring mummies. The museum has twelve mummies on display in the crypt area, however, many are in deteriorating condition because they are not in hermetically sealed cases. Other landmarks View at the Plaza del Carmen Around the Plaza del Carmen, there are a number of historic buildings such as the old municipal palace, which has been converted into the Centro Cultural San √Ångel. Near this are two former mansions which belonged to the Mariscal de Castilla. More of the area's mansions are found on La Amargura Street including one that belonged to the Fagoaga family. This structure dates from the 18th century and belonged to Francisco Fagoaga, who ran the colonial coin mint. It is said that it was also inhabited by Archbishop Alonso N√∫√±ez de Haro y Peralta. Another house on this street was the property of Porfirio D√≠az. The Casa del Obispo Madrid, in contrast, is a simple adobe structure from 1631, which was the property of Bishop Fern√°ndez de Madrid. Later, it was inhabited by General Santa Anna and poet Jos√© Zorrilla. At Plaza de San Jacinto Saturday art market in Plaza San Jacinto The Plaza de San Jacinto is the other main center of the area, best known for its Saturday art bazaar. It is also surrounded by former mansions, most of which have been converted into art galleries and restaurants. The most famous of these is Casa del Risco from the 17th century. Its interior contains a highly ornate Baroque fountain covered in plates, platters, cups and other ceramic pieces from Asia, Europe and Mexico. On the west side of the plaza is the Church of San Jacinto. The Dominicans founded this church in 1596 dedicated to Saint Hyacinth. Its main altar is wood covered in gold. The former monastery is austere and served as such until 1754. Casa del Risco, currently home to Centro Cultural Isidro Fabela Baroque fountain within Casa del Risco The Plazuela de los Licenciados is on Calle de Ju√°rez with three notable residences. One is in European style, another is from the 18th century and the last was the former Hospital Real de Naturales. A short distance from this plaza is another structure called the Casa Blanca which is possibly the oldest in San √Ångel, built in the middle of the 17th century by the Counts of Oploca. Its orchards were second only to those of El Carmen. The Plaza de Arcangeles is small and not well known but it is distinct in its abundance of trees and other vegetation. Its name comes from three large sandstone benches with the name of the Archangels Gabriel, Michael and Rafael on them. The Museo Casa Estudio Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo is on Altavista and Diego Rivera Streets. These were dual houses, one for each painter, connected which served as homes and work spaces for the pair. The structure was built by Juan O'Gorman as one of the first Functionalist structures in Mexico City. The museum has a notable collection of Judas figures made of paper and cardboard and burnt on Holy Saturday. The Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil is on Camino al Desierto de los Leones, which has one of the country's best contemporary art collections. It also is a research and support center for artists. The Pedregal de San √Ångel Ecological Reserve is located in the southwest of Mexico City in the Ciudad Universitaria. It is one of the few undisturbed natural ecosystems in the Valley of Mexico. It is distinguished as being over a relatively solid bed of volcanic rock, from an eruption of the nearby volcano Xitle and has a number of unique plant and animal species. History The San √Ångel area was originally called Tenanitla, which means \\"walled in place\\" in Nahuatl. This referred to the solidified volcanic flow that surrounds the center of San √Ångel, which came from the nearby Xitle Volcano about 2,000 years ago. The modern community has its roots in the establishment of two monastery complexes called San Jacinto and El Carmen in the 16th century, but the real center would be El Carmen. The Spanish town here was originally established with the name of San Jacinto Tenanitla. El Carmen was begun in 1597 when in the indigenous leader of Coyoac√°n, Felipe de Guzm√°n Itzolinque, along with Andr√©s de Mondrag√≥n and Elvira Gutierrez, donated lands to the Carmelites in the Tenanitla and Chimalistac areas. The monks used the land to establish their monastery and a school for monks, with the school, named San √Ångel, inaugurated in 1613. The monastery and school became wealthy and powerful, mostly due to the productively of the lands, especially the orchards which had, at one time, over 13,000 trees. This prompted the community to rename itself San √Ångel. The monastery complex remained important through the colonial period, but a series of misfortunes would lead to its closure by the end of the 19th century. Shortly after Independence, the complex lost many of its monks, who were Spanish born. It was the site of a struggle called the Guerra de las Patentes (War of the Patents) over the payment of rental fees for farmland belonging to the monastery, which the monastery lost. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, U.S. troops sacked and destroyed some of its buildings and orchards and in 1856, the institution had to begin to partition and sell some of its lands. The monastery was closed as such during the Reform War, with only the church portion remaining completely intact. The school portion, called the Colegio, was disputed between the municipal governments of Mexico City and San √Ångel, which were separate at that time. The dispute was settled in San √Ångel's favor in 1874 by Manuel Payno. However, parts of the school would be destroyed in 1891 to make way for the railroad connecting Mexico City to Tizap√°n. What remained became the property of the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica in 1921. In 1939, it would come under the custody of INAH and in the 1950s, it was converted into a museum. The rest of San √Ångel remained a rural farm community. The first change came in the second half of the 18th century, when wealthy families, such as that of the First Count of Revillagigedo, began to build country homes here. Through the 19th century, the area remained rural and popular for visitors. San √Ångel from this time period was described by traveler Marquesa Calder√≥n de la Barca in her book La vida en M√©xico. At the end of the 19th century, a number of factories were set up here such as Loreto, La Alpina and La Hormiga, which raised the area's population. This was the beginning of the urbanization of San √Ångel, although it would remain physically separate from the rest of urbanized Mexico City until the mid-20th century. Much of the area was not considered suitable for mass development until the 1950s, when the Ciudad Universitaria was constructed. The two growing areas would eventually join, completed with the construction of Avenida Insurgentes which divided the former gardens of El Carmen from those of Chimalistac. The construction of Avenida Revoluci√≥n would then divide San √Ångel into two parts. The Pedregal de San √Ångel was declared and ecological reserve in 1983. Since the 20th century, development pressures have increased, with many residential buildings being converted into commercial areas. To work to preserve the area's rural layout and historic buildings, San √Ångel was made the city's first Patrimonial Cultural Tangible de la Ciudad de M√©xico (Tangible Cultural Heritage of Mexico City) in 2008. It was also designated as a \\"Barrio M√°gico\\" by the city in 2011.  Architectural Heritage  The architectonic value of this zone is incalculable. Little by little, this value is being lost to modernity, but in general most of the buildings and spaces that represent various architectural styles such as baroque, neoclassical, and neocolonial have been preserved. A walk through these streets guarantees a flashback to centuries ago. The main features of this zone are its monuments, plazas, narrow stone-paved streets, single or two floored houses made of brick or painted with vivid colors, balconies facing the avenues with vines and decorated front doors. In this neighborhood, you can find various casonas; big, old, majestic houses that usually once belonged to someone important and now presume various architectural styles. Casa del Mayorazgo Fagoaga Mayorazgo de Fagoaga residence This casona from the 17th century was named after a knight of the Santiago order, Don Francisco de Fagoga who was the owner of the house. He was a rich silver and gold merchant from the New Spain colonial era, who separated the gold in Mexico City's coin house in 1735. The house was made with balconies in a Baroque style and it is made as a typical European house from the 19th century with a Neoclassic style. There's a legend that talks about one day when the Padiema Battle was happening, the General Santa Anna was bowling in this property instead of fighting for the country. Centro Cultural San √Ångel Centro Cultural San √Ångel The original structure of this cultural center was part of the Colegio Del Carmen. Halfway through the 19th century, the Colegio Del Carmen was demolished almost in its totality to edify San √Ångel's Municipal Palace, finished in 1887. A century later, June 23, 1987, the edification was finally destined to be the Centro Cultural San √Ångel, having its opening ceremony January 29, 1988. It now holds various temporal expositions and houses the Teatro L√≥pez Tarso. Casa de los Dos Patios This casona was built at the end of the 19th century by philanthropist Francisco de Urquiaga. It features a neoclassical style, popular during the Porfiriato. Its name refers to the two patios the house possesses, the main one with a garden and rooms surrounding it and a secondary one used to keep carriages and horses. Legend tells that it served as a lair for the popular bandit Chucho el Roto, reason why the house is also referred to by his name. The house was restored and now houses the Biblioteca de las Revoluciones de M√©xico. Casa Blanca This casona belonged to the Oploca counts and resembles the countryside houses from the 17th century. Its facade portrays a now blurry coat of arms. It had the second biggest orchard of San √Ångel, after the one in the Convento Del Carmen. It housed invasive troops during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1847. It also housed foreign troops during the French intervention in Mexico. Halfway through the 19th century, it was inhabited by judge Jos√© del Villar Bocanegra, who rearranged it to serve as barracks for a detachment of emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. Later on, it belonged to a nun congregation. The residence was then bought and sold a number of times before being acquired by Mr. William Lucien Morkil in 1902. Baroque fountain at Casa del Risco Casa del Risco This construction of the 17th century was the residence of various characters of Mexican history. During the regime of General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna the house was used as barracks during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Later on it became a hospital that served the Saint Patrick's Battalion, composed mainly by Irish soldiers who defended the Mexican people from invasive troops. In 1933, the Casa del Risco was acquired by Isidro Fabela who donated it to the Mexican people along with his art collection in 1963. The collection consists of more than 1,500,000 documents and around 1,500 photographs, most of them related to the Mexican Revolution. Thanks to that, it now hosts the Centro Cultural Isidro Fabela. Apart from the Historical Archive and some galleries, it has an auditorium where cultural and academic activities are held. The mayor attraction of the museum is a Baroque fountain made of tile, porcelain, seashells and Chinese crockery featuring figures of mermaids and fish. Feria de las Flores Plants for sale at the Feria de las Flores The main annual event for San √Ångel is the Feria de las Flores or Flower Fair, which takes place in July. This event has its origins in the pre- Hispanic period as an event dedicated to Xiuhtecuitl, a god of flowers. The purpose of the original event was to seek the god's protection for the area's floral and fruit crops. When the Carmelites come to the area, they adapted the ritual to Our Lady of Mount Carmen, making her the patroness of the area. This resulted in a festival with both indigenous and Catholic elements. The modern version of the festival began in the late 19th century. Although the religious event continued through the colonial period, its popularity had waned. In 1885, an effort was made to rescue the tradition, having two events, one dedicated to the Our Lady of Mount Carmen and the other to Xiuhtecuitl. These were fused in 1940 by borough authorities with the name la Feria de las Flores de San √Ångel. Since then, the event has become more secular. It begin with a parade of floats starting at the Parque de la Bombilla, and includes activities such as painting exhibitions and contests, concerts, dance and theater recitals, charreada and food tasting. Economy San √Ångel is home to many upscale restaurants (particularly along Avenida de la Paz); boutique shopping center Plaza Grand San √Ångel and the more commercial Plaza Loreto serve the affluent living in the southwest of the city. San √Ångel itself hosts no large malls with department or big box stores. The Mercado del Carmen contains a food hall and design shops. The neighborhood also hosts a concentration of upscale interior design and furniture showrooms along Altavista street, and near the central plaza a concentration of some of the more exclusive shops selling curated selections of Mexican folk art. Public transportation San √Ångel is served by Line 1 (Insurgentes line) of the Mexico City Metrob√∫s bus rapid transit system, by COREV (Corridor Revoluci√≥n) buses, while the Miguel √Ångel de Quevedo station on Line 3 of the Mexico City metro (subway) is about 1 kilometer east of the neighborhood.

Research and Impact  Dr. Slavin's research has focused on developing and evaluating methods to improve the academic performance of disadvantaged students. He is known for his work on cooperative learning, in which students work in small teams to help each other learn. Starting in 1987, he and his wife, Dr. Nancy Madden, led the development and evaluation of Success for All, a whole-school reform approach focused in particular on ensuring that all students succeed in reading. In 2020, Success for All is engaged with approximately 1000 schools in the U.S., England, and the Netherlands, using all or part of the approach. Dr. Slavin has been a major proponent of the use of programs proven to be effective in rigorous research. He has published many meta-analyses synthesizing research on elementary and secondary reading, mathematics, writing, science, and early childhood programs. In 2007, he began a free website called the Best Evidence Encyclopedia, to make these reviews available to educators and researchers. In 2017, after the U.S. Congress passed the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), he launched another website, Evidence for ESSA, intended to help educators determine which specific programs would meet Evidence for ESSA evidence standards. Dr. Slavin has also carried out research on tutoring for struggling readers, programs for kindergarten, writing, mathematics, social-emotional learning, and many other topics. In all, he has published more than 300 refereed articles.

Formation Union was formed in 1997 when ex-Kiss guitarist Bruce Kulick, ex-M√∂tley Cr√ºe vocalist and guitarist John Corabi, bassist James Hunting, and drummer Brent Fitz united to form a band. Kulick left Kiss after they decided to go back to their original lineup, and Corabi left M√∂tley Cr√ºe under similar circumstances. Studio work Union released two studio albums and a live album. Union, recorded in 1997 and released in 1998, which featured two singles: \\"Old Man Wise\\" and \\"October Morning Wind\\". Three versions of this CD were released. The first pressing of the disc omitted \\"Old Man Wise\\" from the cover art, but this was corrected in subsequent pressings. The second version, a Japanese import, included the bonus track \\"For You\\" with Kulick on lead vocals. The third was reissued with the bonus cover track of The Beatles' \\"Oh! Darling\\" sung by Corabi. The CD was co-produced by Corabi, Kulick and Curt Cuomo. In 1998 a grass root effort, \\"The Union Work Force\\", spread out across the U.S. as the band toured small clubs from coast to coast. Kulick and Corabi took this a step further by performing at many of the Kiss Expo's doing acoustic versions of their songs. On a few occasions, Fitz and Hunting were able to join them. In 1999, Live at the Galaxy, mixed by Bruce Bouillet and Kulick, was released. Recorded at The Galaxy Club, the CD features songs from the band's first CD, two Kiss songs (\\"Jungle\\" and \\"I Walk Alone\\" from Carnival of Souls), \\"Power to the Music\\" from Corabi's M√∂tley Cr√ºe days, and \\"Man in the Moon\\" from The Scream. \\"Surrender\\", a Cheap Trick cover, and the added acoustic tracks \\"October Morning Wind\\" and The Beatles' \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\" proved the band's versatility. The new millennium dawned on Union's second studio CD, The Blue Room, produced by Bob Marlette. The CD spawned two singles, \\"Do Your Own Thing\\" and \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\". The Blue Room Tour took the band through the U.S., Europe, Australia and Central America. Hiatus By the end of 2000, one by one the band members began to get involved in other individual musical projects: Fitz toured and recorded with Guns N' Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke, Kulick joined Grand Funk Railroad as their guitarist, and Corabi joined Ratt as their second guitarist. In 2001, both Fitz and Hunting joined original M√∂tley Cr√ºe vocalist Vince Neil as band members. All the band members featured on the Bruce Kulick solo albums Audiodog (2001) and Transformer (2003) In 2005, the group played together for the first time in about three years with two live shows in Japan. Fitz was unable to attend (due to touring commitments with the band Theory Of A Deadman), so Kulick's former Kiss bandmate and friend Eric Singer filled in. Also in 2005, Kulick oversaw the release of a Union DVD, Do Your Own Thing Live, containing two full-length live shows plus bonus material. In November and December 2005, Union toured in Europe to promote the DVD; Kulick and Corabi were joined by Chuck Garric and Fred Coury instead of Hunting and Fitz.

The current members of the group are Nuno Loureiro, Raul Vicente, and Paulo Lafaia.  History  = Debut and demo tape = Arising from a very assorted musical scene, the band played under the name of Breed Machine until changing their musical structure. The founding members were Nuno Loureiro (lead guitar and vocals), Paulo Lafaia (drums), Alexandre Afonso (bass), and Ricardo Correia (guitar). All of them had previous projects, including Nuno Merciless Death, Exiled, Sublevel, Disaffected, Grog, and Squad. All of the members had also played with Mortify. The band started to work on songs, they began to tour, and in the last two weeks of December 1998, they released a demo tape. The tape was produced by Nuno Loureiro and recorded in the band's rehearsal room. =Aggressive Ways to Pacify= In April 1999, work on the debut album, Aggressive Ways to Pacify, began in the Rec'N'Roll studios, owned by Luis Barros. Soon after, the band signed a record deal with Paranoid Records. Aggressive Ways to Pacify was released in 2001. After its release, Painstruck began an extensive tour of Portugal and Spain. The tour included a two-date set with the heavy-metal band Biohazard. In summer 2002, Painstruck received an invitation to play at one of Portugal's largest summer festivals, Ermal. Other invitees included Slipknot, Dimmu Borgir, and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. = A Whole New Perception = Aggressive Ways to Pacify sold well in Portugal that year. The second album, A Whole New Perception, was already finished by March, and was released in October 2002. Painstruck aimed for this to be their masterpiece. The first release of the album sold out, and a second edition, with never-before-seen photos and videos, was released. In 2003, Painstruck played a two-night set with Stone Sour. A friend of the band recorded the action and compiled the footage in a video for one of the band's singles, \\"In Us You Live.\\" The video played throughout the year on the TV station Sol Musica, and the band was invited to the 2003 Ermal festival, one of Portugal's most famous festivals. =Recent events= In April 2005, the band began a new round of touring.

Leo is the character Jerry Seinfeld's uncle. Uncle Leo made his debut in the second-season episode \\"The Pony Remark\\" and appeared in at least one episode in each of the additional seasons through the show's nine- season run. On the 25th anniversary of the show's debut, Rolling Stone ranked Uncle Leo as No. 6 on its list of \\"100 Best Seinfeld Characters,\\" behind only Newman at No. 5 and the four main characters: Jerry, Kramer, Elaine and George. Description Uncle Leo is the brother of Jerry's mother, Helen; his last name is never revealed. In an episode where Leo signs for a package addressed to Jerry, he actually signs it \\"Uncle Leo\\". In \\"The Bookstore\\", Jerry mentions \\"Leo\\" to Kramer. Kramer is initially confused, but upon remembering, he says, \\"Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle Leo. Forgot his first name.\\" Uncle Leo is very eccentric and a \\"general kvetch.\\" When coming across Jerry, he always exclaims his catchphrase, \\"Jerry! Hello!\\" with his arms wide open. When Jerry has a Cape Fear-esque nightmare about him in \\"The Bookstore,\\" Leo has the word \\"Jerry\\" tattooed on the fingers of his right hand and \\"Hello\\" on the fingers of his left. When talking to people, Uncle Leo has a tendency to grab the person's arm (often uncomfortably) and hold them close. In \\"The Pony Remark,\\" Jerry guesses that he does this \\"because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.\\" Uncle Leo often brags about his son (Jerry's cousin Jeffrey, who never appears on the show) and his various accomplishments while working in the Parks Department. Leo is very sensitive about greetings; when Jerry once avoided stopping to talk to his uncle on the street (because Jerry was on his way to a meeting), Leo was offended and called Jerry's mother in Florida to complain about the snub. Leo is retired. His wife, Stella, is seen in the third-season episode \\"The Pen,\\" but by the seventh season he is either widowed or divorced. In \\"The Shower Head\\", he is living with a woman named Lydia. He breaks up with her because Jerry joked on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno about Leo's paranoid obsession with anti-semitism in ridiculous contexts, such as claiming that a cook is anti-semitic for overcooking his hamburger. Lydia found Jerry's comments funny, so Uncle Leo accused her of being an anti-semite as well. He resumes the relationship later on in the episode, although neither Stella nor Lydia is mentioned in subsequent episodes. In \\"The Package,\\" Leo receives a package for Jerry after Jerry refuses it, being suspicious that it could contain a bomb. Although initially refusing George's suggestion to let Leo open the package, he encourages Leo to open it after Leo asks Jerry to accompany him to Jeffrey's Parks Department production of the The Mikado. This happens over the phone, and Jerry hears a loud explosion once Leo agrees to open the box. Except for having his eyebrows and moustache burnt off, Leo is unharmed. Elaine later quickly draws new eyebrows on him with her eyeliner, leaving him with a comical expression of anger. In \\"The Bookstore,\\" Jerry catches Uncle Leo in the act of shoplifting at a local bookstore, thereafter confronting him about it. Leo maintains that seniors have the upper hand since they can claim senility (\\"Come on! I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What‚Äôs my name? Will you take me home?‚Äù); he also reminds Jerry to always greet him \\"Hello\\" no matter how awkward the situation. Jerry later unintentionally gets Leo arrested by \\"bookstore police\\" after Leo attempts yet another theft. During this episode, we learn that Uncle Leo has a criminal record related to a \\"crime of passion.\\" \\"He's the kind of guy who is a total nuisance at times and the kind of guy you avoid. He's a very expansive character, and that has an attraction to it,\\" Lesser said of the character in 1998. Character legacy Len Lesser, who portrayed Uncle Leo, exhibited some of the same character traits, especially the overly excited greeting manners, when he later portrayed the character Garvin he portrayed from 1996-2004 on Everybody Loves Raymond. Lesser died in 2011. His role as Uncle Leo was remembered as an \\"iconic\\" and \\"scene-stealing\\" character. Despite his persona as a complaining braggart, Uncle Leo \\"still managed to be loveable\\".

All sorts of regulated standards are included, with examples ranging from charting rules for design documentation to recipes and nutritional facts of Soviet-era brand names (which have now become generic, but may only be sold under the label if the technical standard is followed, or renamed if they are reformulated). The notion of GOST has certain significance and recognition in the countries of the standards' jurisdiction. Russian government agency Rosstandart has gost.ru as its website address.  History  Cover page of a Soviet-era GOST standard (arc welding in protective atmosphere) GOST standards were originally developed by the government of the Soviet Union as part of its national standardization strategy. The word GOST (Russian: ) is an acronym for gosudarstvennyy standart (Russian: '), which means state standard or governmental standard . The history of national standards in the USSR can be traced back to 1925, when a government agency, later named Gosstandart, was established and put in charge of writing, updating, publishing, and disseminating the standards. After World War II, the national standardization program went through a major transformation. The first GOST standard, GOST 1 State Standardization System, was published in 1968.  Present  After the disintegration of the USSR, the GOST standards acquired a new status of the regional standards. They are now administered by the Euro-Asian Council for Standardization, Metrology and Certification (EASC), a standards organization chartered by the Commonwealth of Independent States. At present, the collection of GOST standards includes over 20,000 titles used extensively in conformity assessment activities in 12 countries. Serving as the regulatory basis for government and private-sector certification programs throughout the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the GOST standards cover energy, oil and gas, environmental protection, construction, transportation, telecommunications, mining, food processing, and other industries. The following countries have adopted all or some of GOST standards in addition to their own, nationally developed standards: Russia, Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Georgia, and Turkmenistan. Because GOST standards are adopted by Russia, the largest and most influential member of the CIS, it is a common misconception to think of GOST standards as the national standards of Russia. They are not. Since the EASC, the organization responsible for the development and maintenance of the GOST standards, is recognized by ISO as a regional standards organization, the GOST standards are classified as the regional standards. The national standards of Russia are the GOST R standards. Ukraine scrapped its GOST (DSTU) standards in December 2015.Ukraine scraps Soviet GOST standards, UNIAN (16 December 2015)  GOST standards and technical specifications  The abbreviation GOST (rus) (SUST) (eng) stands for the State Union Standard. From its name we learn that most of the GOST standards of the Russian Federation came from the Soviet Union period. Creation and promotion of the Union Standards began in 1918 after introduction of the international systems of weights and measures. The first body for standardization was created by the Council of Labor and Defense in 1925 and was named the Committee for Standardization. Its main objective was development and introduction of the Union standards OST standards. The first OST standards gave the requirements for iron and ferrous metals, selected sorts of wheat, and a number of consumer goods. Until 1940, People's Commissariats (Narcomats) had approved the standards. But in that year the Union Standardization Committee was founded and the standardization was redirected to creation of OST standards. In 1968 the state system of standardization (SSS) as the first in the world practice. It included creating and developing five standards: * GOST ‚Äì State Standard of the Soviet Union * RST ‚Äì Republican standard * IST ‚Äì Industrial Standard * STE ‚Äì Standard of an Enterprise * TU ‚Äì –¢–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è, literally \\"Technical conditions\\", a document setting technical requirements to which a specific product, material, substance, etc. must comply; example: TU 14-3-571-2004, for CrNi60WTi alloy The level of technical development, and the need to develop and introduce informational calculating systems and many other factors, lead to creating complexes of standards and a number of large general technical standard systems. They are named inter-industrial standards. Within the state standard system they have their own indexes and the SSS has index 1. , seven standard systems (GOST standards) are valid: * USCD ‚Äì The Uniform System of Constructor Documentation (index 2) * USTD ‚Äì The Uniform System of Technological Documentation (3) * SIBD ‚Äì The System of Information-Bibliographical Documentation (7) * SSM ‚Äì The State System of Providing the Uniformity of Measuring(8) * SSLS ‚Äì The System of Standards of Labor Safety(12) * USPD ‚Äì The Uniform System of Program Documentation (19) * SSERTE ‚Äì The System of Standards of Ergonomic Requirements and Technical Esthetic (29) The USCD and USTD systems take special place among other inter-industrial systems. They are interrelated and they formulate requirements for general technical documentation in all industries of economy. The task of harmonization of Russia's standards and the GOST standards was set in 1990 by the Soviet Council of Ministers at the beginning of the transit to market economy. At that time they formulated a direction that obeying the GOST standards may be obligatory or recommendable. The obligatory requirements are the ones that deal with safety, conformity of products, ecological friendliness and inter- changeability. The Act of the USSR Government permitted applying of national standards existing in other countries, international requirements if they meet the requirements of the people's economy. During the past years a large number of GOST standards were developed and approved. Nowadays there is a process of their revision so that they conform to international standard requirements. As the base is the system of international standards ISO, in Russia they created series of Russian standards such as GOST ISO 9001 or GOST ISO 14001, which absorbed the best developments of the world community but they also consider the Russia's specific.

Thus, the GOST standards are used across all CIS countries, including Russia while GOST R standards are valid only within the territory of the Russian Federation. This system is aimed at providing the customer with safety and high quality of products and services. This right of the customer for safety and quality is guaranteed by obligatory certification of not only native, but also foreign produce. Produce that enters the territory of the Russian Federation and that is subject to obligatory certification according to the legislation of the Russian Federation must meet the requirements of Russian certification system. List of products subject to obligatory certification is defined by Gosstandart and can be seen on www.gost.ru. The very system of certification GOST R has been valid in Russia for many years. The main normative base for it was national standards. At the same time active policy of Russia towards entering the WTO was the reason for adopting the federal law \\"On Technical Regulation\\" ‚Ññ 184-–§–ó. This law was designed to match Russian and European legislation in the sphere of technical regulation.  Certification systems  Creation of certification systems in Russia is provided by the Federal Law ‚Ññ184 \\"On Technical Regulation\\" Evaluating the product's conformity to requirements of laws, standards, technical reglaments and other kinds of normative appears to be one of the most important possibilities of providing safety of different kinds of products for humans, environment and the state. According to the FL ‚Ññ 184 any certification system includes: * A central certification organ which performs organizational operations within the system; * Certification organs that must prove their ability to perform activities in expertise and drawing up the certification documents in certain sphere of evaluation of conformity. Only certification organs authorized for such kinds of works, have right to perform such function; * Certification laboratories performs tests and measurements of safety indicators or quality of the evaluated objects. Such laboratory must have equipment and trained staff (and test methods) to perform its activities. Existence of all the resources is proved by the Attestation of Authorization of the laboratory in the given sphere of activity; * Applicants are individual entrepreneurs or Russian legal entities (in some cases foreign manufacturers), that intend to go through evaluation process to prove the conformity of their production to the legal requirements or some other certain requirements of the system of certification (to which it applied). There is a great variety of objects for certification (different products and manufacturing processes, management systems, construction sites, etc.). A little smaller is the lists of risks that may be encountered by using some products and from which consumers should be protected. The variety of certification systems in Russia is explained by these two factors and by the wish of some corporations to introduce their own requirements for the product's deliverers. There two big groups of certification systems in Russia: voluntary and obligatory ones. From the names, it is clear that the evaluation of conformity for the objects of obligatory certification system appears to be mandatory requirement for all Russian manufacturers and for the products from abroad.  Obligatory certification  It is only federal state structure who can create the obligatory certification system of Russia. The system must go through the procedure of state registration. The Rosstandart which is responsible for the certification in Russia as a whole keeps a registry of the RF certification systems. Only after receiving the Certificate of state registration with getting the unique registration number, may activities be performed in evaluating conformity as a new system. There are 16 obligatory certification systems in Russia: * GOST R; * Means of protection of information according to requirements of informational security; * \\"Electrocommunication\\"; * Geodesic, cartographic and topographic production; * On the federal Railway transport; * Means of protection of information; * Security of manufacturing of explosives; * In the sphere of fire security; * Means of protection of information according to requirements of security; * Marine civil vessels; * On the air transport of the RF; * Air techniques and the objects of civil aviation; * Space craft; * For nuclear sets, the points of storing radioactive materials; * Means of protecting the information that include the state secret; * Immune biological preparations. The obligatory GOST R certification system consists of sub-systems of certificating homogeneous products. The obligatory GOST R certification system consists of 40 sub-systems according to the kinds of homogeneous production. For example, the following sub-systems: * Medical certification; * The system of certification oil products; * The system of certification of dishes; * The system of certification of electrical equipment (SCE); * The system of certification of mechanic transport means and trailers; * The system of certification of gases; * The \\"SEPROCHIM\\" certification system (rubber, asbestos) and many others. The management of state property in the sphere of technical regulation, organizing an performing works in certification in the GOST R system is performed by the Rostechregulation (former Gosstandart) which appears to be the Federal agency for technical regulation and metrology (now is called Rosstandart). The given agency is part of the structure of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the RF. It became the very first and the largest system of evaluation of conformity in Russia and it encompasses all the groups of production that are to be evaluated according to the Federal Law \\"About protection of Consumers Rights\\" and it performs the other legislative acts considering separate kinds of goods The authority of the GOST R obligatory certification systems covers also the voluntary GOST R certification system because the applicants for the voluntary evaluation of conformity most often apply this very system.  Voluntary certification  Any Russian citizen may register such evaluation system according to the Law. While creating the system they must set the list of objects to be evaluated on conformity in its frameworks, the indicators and characteristics in accord to which the voluntary certification will be performed, they must also formulate the rules of system and the pay order of the works in certification, and they must define the participants of the given system of evaluation of conformity. Registration of voluntary certification system is similar to the procedure of registration of the obligatory system. In the case of refusal, the Rosstandart sends to the applicant explanations of reasons why the new system may not be registered. Nowadays there are more than 130 central certification organs that went through the registration procedure. Examples of voluntary certification: * Construction materials \\"Rosstroisertificazia\\"; * Personnel and housing services ‚Äì \\"Roszhilkommunsertifikazia\\"; * Means of cryptographic protection of information; * The production of the Gosstandart of Russia; * Production and the quality systems defense industries ‚Äì \\"Oboronsertifika\\"; * Certification of food \\"HAASP\\"; * Coal production; * Jewelry (several systems in the given sphere with different names; * Bio active materials ‚Äì \\"BOSTI\\"; * Services in the sphere of advertising; * Evaluation of intellectual property objects; * Information technologies ‚Äì \\"SSIT\\". = Corporative voluntary certification systems = * Fuel and energy complex (The System \\"Teksert\\"); * Equipment for the oil-gas industry \\"Neftegaz\\"; * GAZPROMSERT; = Regional national certification systems = * Trading services in Moscow; * Trading services \\"Tulasert\\"; * Services of gas stations and complexes in Moscow; * Fuel services in the Moscow Region; * Services of retail sale in the Sakhalin Region; * Services of retail sale in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia); * Services of gas stations and complexes of the Urals Region \\"URALSERT-AZS\\"; * Services of retail sale in St. Petersburg and others.  Russian GOST standards in English  Normally it is difficult to find GOST standards translated into English. There is one company that is mainly engaged in creating high quality translations of codes and regulations, called Gost- Pevorod. Their library in English is currently the largest on the internet, with over 350,000 Russian regulatory documents and standards. Database covers all Russian Federation and CIS standards: Russian Federation, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Tadjikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Ukraine, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. They also provide access to the international standards (ISO, IEC) and other national standards (ASTM, ASME, ANSI, API, AWS, DIN, EIA, IEEE, AFNOR, BS, NEMA, NFPA, etc.) in original language and also translated into Russian. The main orientation is regulatory services with an emphasis on affordable technical and regulatory translations. One can easily find all required RF GOST standards (national standards), and Russian and CIS countries standards and technical regulations for all major industries, including Russian Federal Norms and Regulations in the field of industrial safety (FNiP), Building Codes (SNiP, SP, SNiP RK, SP RK, KMK, SHNK, SNT), Industry Codes and Safety Rules (RD, PB), Sanitation Regulations (SanPiN, GN), Electrical Installation Codes (PUE), Fire Codes (NPB, PPB), technical regulations of the Customs Union (TR TS) and norms, instructions, procedures, cost estimate standards, Russian and CIS federal and regional legislation and many others.
