Pollock in his book How to Build a Person () to defend the idea of token physicalism, agent materialism, and strong AI. It ultimately illustrates what is needed for an Artificial Intelligence to be built and why humans are just like intelligent machines. Fable Once in a distant land there lived a race of Engineers. They have all their physical needs provided by the machines they have invented. One of the Engineers decide that he will create an \\"intelligent machine\\" that is much more ingenious than the more machines, in that it can actually sense, learn, and adapt to its environment as an intelligent animal. =Oscar I= The first version of the machine is called \\"Oscar I\\". It has pain sensors and \\"fight-or- flight\\" responses build within to help it survive hostile environment. In this stage Oscar I is much like the machines Hilary Putnam considers in 1960. =Oscar II = In order for Oscar I to avoid damages in hostile environment, it must not only be able to respond to its pain sensors but also predict what is likely to happen based on its generalization of its pain sensor activations. Therefore, a \\"pain sensor sensor\\" was built to sense its pain sensors, thus giving it a rudimentary self-awareness. In this stage Oscar I is much like an amoeba as Oscar II like a worm. Amoebas respond to pain while worms learn to avoid it. =Oscar III= The problem with Oscar II is that it has no conception if the environment is fooling him. For example, he can't distinguish if a machine-eating tiger and a mirror image of such tiger. To solve such problem, \\"introspective sensors\\" were built into Oscar II and made him \\"Oscar III\\". Oscar III can now sense the operation of its own sensors and form generalization about its reliability, thus acquired a higher degree of self-awareness. In this stage Oscar II is much like a bird as Oscar III a kitten. Kittens quickly learn about mirror image and come to ignore them while birds go on attacking their own reflection until they become exhausted. =Mind/Body Problem= Consider a world populated by Oscarites. If the Oscarites are sufficiently intelligent, it can philosophizing the difference between their outward physical state and inward mental state. While we, from our perspective, describe the Oscarites as sensing the operation of their perceptual sensors, they describe it as they are \\"being self-aware and being conscious\\". =Conclusion= In the end of the fable Pollock states that while the Engineers are fictional, Oscar is real and we are in fact the Oscarites.

St√ºlpnagel then ordered the arrest of all 1,200 SS personnel in the city. The 325th's Security Regiment 1 carried out the task and imprisoned them in Fresnes Prison and Fort de l'Est.

Minnesota was won by the Republican candidate, former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Charles Evans Hughes won the state over incumbent President Woodrow Wilson by a margin of just 392 votes, or 0.1011968% (one vote in 988). This is the fifteenth-closest statewide presidential election on record, and although it was only the second-closest result in 1916 after New Hampshire, there was not to be a closer result until Adlai Stevenson II won Kentucky in 1952 by 700 of 993,148 votes. Wilson's performance was the closest any Democrat had come to carrying Republican stronghold Minnesota since Minnesota's statehood inception in 1858Counting the Votes; Minnesota ‚Äì he was almost five percent ahead of his losing margin in 1912 when the state was won by Progressive Theodore Roosevelt. Wilson comfortably won the urban counties of Ramsey, Hennepin and St. Louis, which became rigid strongholds for the Democratic Party. Wilson also led Hughes in the socialist strongholds of the forestry- and mining-dominated northern counties. Nevertheless, Hughes won the state with dominance of the farming districts in the south and his ability to carry fifty-three of eighty-seven state counties. Wilson was however the first Democrat to ever carry Lake, Kandiyohi, Saint Louis, Norman, Todd, Lyon, Murray and Martin Counties,Menendez, Albert J.; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004, pp. 228-231 the first to carry Carlton County since Winfield S.

Nationally, Wilson won the election, with 277 electoral votes and a tight 3.12% lead over Hughes in the popular vote. Wilson's re-election was the first instance in which a Democratic President was elected to a second consecutive term since Andrew Jackson‚Äôs 1832 re-election. this would be the last time that a Democrat would win the presidency without carrying Minnesota.

Centered on City Hall Park, the area's architecture encapsulates the city's development from a frontier town to an urban commercial center. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history City Hall Park is located at the southern end of the Church Street Marketplace in downtown Burlington. The park occupies most of a city block, with the eastern side of the block lined by buildings separating it from Church Street. It has a network of paths radiating out from a central fountain, and otherwise consists of grassy areas dotted with trees. The three buildings on the east side are formally oriented to Church Street, but present proper facades to the park. The southernmost building is Burlington City Hall, a large neo-Classical and Georgian Revival building constructed in 1928 to a design by W.M. Kendall of McKim, Mead, and White. The park is bounded on the other three sides by Main Street, St. Paul Street, and College Street, each of which is lined with commercial buildings. These are almost uniformly three stories in height and built of brick, and most were built between about 1880 and 1930. The most architecturally sophisticated of these is the Burlington Savings Bank Building at the corner of College and St. Paul, built in 1900 in a high interpretation of the Renaissance Revival. The historic district excludes the buildings on the west side of the park, which are included in the abutting Wells-Richardson Complex historic district, and includes buildings on the west side of Church Street south of Main. The latter buildings are of a more diverse architecture, including some that date to the early 19th century. with Burlington's City Hall Park was originally known as Court House Square, and was laid out in the late 18th century, roughly midway between its waterfront and its early inland commercial area on College Hill to the north. This site may have been chosen as a compromise between competing business interests, and it provided a level area for a public park. It saw its most rapid growth in the second quarter of the 19th century, after the opening of the Champlain Canal brought a mercantile economic boom to the city. Most of the buildings now lining the square were built as larger replacements for the wood-frame buildings of this early boom, with most of the construction taking place in between 1890 and 1915, and in the 1920s.

Life =Provenance and early childhood= Paula Kathinka D√∂ll was born in L√∂rrach (Baden), directly across the border to the north of Basel. Her father was a businessman and the family lived reasonably well, but when she was seven her father died and her mother took them to live at Friedrichroda on the edge of the Thuringian Forest, and where her mother ran a small guest house for summer holidaymakers. =Politics trumps teaching= She attended an all-girls' school in Friedrichroda and the commercial school in Gotha before moving on to the Teacher Training College in Eisenach between 1888 and 1890. Her ambition to become a teacher had encountered initial opposition from her guardian and her mother, but she nevertheless persisted, passing her qualifying exams in 1890 and teaching, initially, in Friedrichroda. By 1893 she had moved to Leipzig where she taught in a girls' school. In November 1893 she attended a political meeting which was addressed by Clara Zetkin by whom she was greatly impressed. The next year she herself started teaching at evening classes organised by the Leipzig Workers' Education League. It was here that she first met Hermann Duncker, studying to become a music teacher, and later her husband. However, in 1895 or 1896 she lost her job at the Leipzig school because of her Socialism (\\"wegen sozialistischer Gesinnung\\"). She moved to Hamburg where she taught at another all-girls' school. In Hamburg she became involved in the dockworkers' strike which occurred between November 1896 and February 1897. As a result of her support for the strike she was, as before, dismissed from her teaching post. The realisation that the career teaching children which she loved and for which she had struggled, was going to be incompatible with her political involvement, was a heavy blow. She returned to Leipzig where, despite not being enrolled at the university, she was able to attend certain lectures on a \\"guest basis\\", notably those delivered by Karl B√ºcher. It was, she later asserted, as a result of her studies at this time that she produced her first publication, \\"On the participation of the female sex in employment\\" (\\"Ueber die Beteiligung des weiblichen Geschlechts an der Erwerbsth√§tigkeit\\"). Her study concluded that industrialisation would expand employment openings for women, and that it would become impossible to restrict women's professional careers. She married Hermann Duncker, by now an economics student, towards the end of 1898. Their daughter, Hedwig, was born in 1899. In the meantime, K√§te immersed herself in the leftwing politics of the city, becoming first a member of the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD) and then a party worker, although legally it only became permissible for women to participate in politics in 1908. She employed her teaching skills, giving lectures to the Workers' Education League covering literature, pedagogy, history, socio-politics and economics. She became the chair of the \\"Association for women and girls of the working class\\" (\\"Verein f√ºr Frauen und M√§dchen der Arbeiterklasse\\") in Leipzig. In February 1903 the couple's second child, Karl was born: K√§te Duncker's health collapsed. They moved away from Leipzig to Dresden. As she recovered she returned to lecturing on child protection, education and women's rights. Another publication on child labour (\\"Die Kinderarbeit und ihre Bek√§mpfung\\") appeared in 1906. Over the next few years she developed a close friendship with Clara Zetkin which was both personal and political. In 1906 she became deputy controlling editor for \\"Die Gleichheit\\" (\\"Equality\\"), the women's magazine managed by Zetkin, under whose direction it had surged from obscurity to a distribution estimated in 1907 at 70,000 copies. Duncker's particular area of responsibility on the paper was the section entitled \\"For our children\\", which became a great favourite with working-class families. In 1906 she gave a presentation to the fourth SPD Women's Congress in Mannheim on care of women during and following pregnancy. In 1907 the family relocated to Stuttgart. That year she gave a presentation on education to the Women's Congress in Nuremberg. In 1910 she was a delegate at the International Socialist Women's Conference in Copenhagen (held in tandem with that year's International Socialist Congress), at which she delivered a presentation on motherhood and childcare. She was also involved in the resolution to introduce an international Women's Day, proposed at the conference by her friend, Clara Zetkin. The first International Women's Day celebrated in Germany (and Denmark, Austria and Switzerland) duly took place on 19 March 1911 (although the idea had come from a national Women's Day first celebrated in New York on 28 February 1909). In 1911 Duncker gave a presentation to the SPD Party Conference, held that year in Jena, where, according to one source, she had her first encounter with Rosa Luxemburg. By now, a couple of months before the birth of her third child early in 1909, she had withdrawn from her editorial position with \\"Die Gleichheit\\". She had been a member of the party's national Education Committee since 1908. In 1912 the family relocated again, this time to Berlin. =War and the Spartacus League= War broke out at the end of July 1914. In the Reichstag (national parliament) the SPD leadership implemented an effective party truce for its duration. In a vote held on 4 August 1914, instead of voting against war credits, the SPD abstained. From the outset, however, this version of patriotism from the party leadership encountered opposition from internationalist and left-wing party members.Susanne Miller: Burgfrieden und Klassenkampf. Die deutsche Sozialdemokratie im Ersten Weltkrieg. Verlag Droste, D√ºsseldorf 1974 (Contributions to \\"Geschichte des Parlamentarismus und der politischen Parteien\\", Vol. 53). Hermann and K√§te Duncker passionately opposed funding for the war, and as economic destitution on the home front mounted, the call for an end to the slaughter on the front line would only grow louder. In 1915 K√§te Duncker, was a co-founder of the news-sheet, \\"The International\\", to which she became a frequent contributor. The news-sheet took its name from International Group which had been launched within the SPD on the initiative of Rosa Luxemburg at outbreak of the war and to which the Dunckers had been early recruits. In 1916 the International Group was renamed, becoming the Spartacus League. Duncker continued to campaign against the war, using her background on the party's education to locate and address youth groups, while also producing illegal \\"Spartacus Letters\\" (\\"Spartakusbriefe\\"), carrying the same pro-peace messages. This earned her a \\"speech ban\\" on 30 May 1916. She worked in Berlin with Leo Jogiches to coordinate anti-war efforts across the country. In September 1916 she represented the Spartacus League at the national party conference of the SPD.Shortly after this she suffered a health crisis and spent three months in a sanatorium. From 1918 she was responsible for \\"Women work\\" (\\"Frauenarbeit\\") in the Spartacus League headquarters. =Post war chaos= Regarding the closing phases of the war, sources are relatively silent on her pacifist activism. In the context of the revolutionary months that followed national military defeat, following the murders in January 1919 of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, K√§te Duncker was arrested on 16 January 1919: she was briefly detained and interrogated. She then moved back to Leipzig where the risk of sudden attack or further arrest seemed less pressing than in Berlin. During the war her sons had been sent to Denmark where they were staying with friends, and in Match 1919, around the time when Leo Jogiches was murdered, she joined them. However, her Danish residence permit was of short duration, and at the end of May 1919 she had to move on to Sweden, where , a philosophy professor at Lund University to whom her friend Gertrud Liljequist was married, was able to provide the necessary guarantees on her behalf. From Lund she followed post war developments with keen interest. Writing to her husband on 25 June 1919, she identified the peace terms imposed by US president, Woodrow Wilson as the \\"dictates of an imperialistic power, victorious following the downfall of its German rival\\" (\\"Diktat imperialistischer Siegerm√§chte √ºber den niedergeworfenen Konkurrenten Deutschland\\"). However, much of her attention was devoted to planning for future developments of socialism and the labour movement in Germany. (She also helped with the translation of at least one Swedish habilitation dissertation into German, in order to try and support herself financially.) According to one source, by 1919 Duncker felt that she had been greatly aged by her activities and experiences during the First World War. The next few years indicated that her reserves of energy were not yet spent, however. =Weimar years= The SPD had finally broken apart over the issue of support for the war in 1917. The two principal breakaway movements were the Spartacus League and the Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). A century later, it is not always easy to differentiate the two movements from each other, and in March 1917 the Spartacus League merged into the USPD while retaining a semi-autonomous status within it. Some of the contradictions inherent in these arrangements were addressed at a conference held in Berlin between 30 December 1918 and 1 January 1919 which gave structure to agreements entered into earlier in the month, in the process establishing the Communist Party of Germany. Hermann and K√§te Duncker were among its first members, elected early on to the party central committee. K√§te Duncker returned from Sweden towards the end of 1919 and embarked on a brief series of lectures at the Workers' Education College (\\"Arbeiterbildungsschule\\") in Berlin, also supporting herself with translation work. In December 1919, with her husband, she moved back to Thuringia where the family were allocated an apartment in Gotha-Siebleben. 1920 was a difficult year as the region became a focus for the L√ºttwitz-Kapp Putsch. In the aftermath of the violence the local left-wing district government resigned and Hermann Duncker, employed by it in a senior secretarial/administrative capacity, lost his job and was obliged to resort to his \\"fallback occupation\\" as a peripatetic teacher working for the Communist party, which had a depressive impact on the family. =Regional parliament= In the late summer of 1921 Duncker invited by the party to stand as a candidate for the regional parliament (Landtag). The candidacy was not without controversy among her political comrades, and at one stage she withdrew it. Nevertheless, in the end her name was on the Communist Party candidate list and in December 1921, now aged fifty, she was elected to the chamber. She addressed her parliamentary responsibilities with characteristic energy, her contributions focusing on issues involving childhood, and building on ideas that had originated during her time as a teacher in Eisenach and Friedrichroda. She campaigned for the introduction of nutritious school meals and of cr√®che facilities. She urged improvements in the education available to ordinary people. As a result of her truncated teaching career K√§te Duncker had become a proponent of the precepts developed by the education pioneer Maria Montessori, which led her to concern herself with enhancements to the professionalism of teacher training. During a period of on-going internal fractionalism within the Communist Party her parliamentary duties had to be combined with endless national and regional party meetings. The quantity of parliamentary and party work could be exhausting and she suffered several interludes of absence caused by illness. On top of her other activities, she continued organising women's groups across the region. It is clear from her letters that these meetings, and the lively discussions that often broke out at them, remained very important to her. Following a further period of unrest, in November 1923 the regional government in Thuringia, which had been a coalition between the SPD and her own Communist group, collapsed. In February 1924 she was not nominated as a candidate in the subsequent election. =Twilight years of the Weimar democracy= Relations between the Soviet communist party and the German communist party were close during the Weimar years. Between March 1924 and July 1924 K√§te Duncker undertook an extended visit to Moscow. By 1926 she was living back in Berlin. Some evidence of her activities and impressions from her first visit to the Soviet Union appeared in her 1927 publication \\"Women in the Soviet Union\\" (\\"Die Frau in der Sowjetunion\\"). After 1925 she joined with her husband in his teaching work and political journalism, also teaching classes at the Marxist Workers School (\\"Marxistische Arbeiterschule\\" / \\"MASCH\\") in Berlin. =Nazi years and exile= R√©gime change in January 1933 signalled a rapid transition to one- party dictatorship, with communists high on the government hate list. Intrusive house searches and book burnings became mainstream. Hermann Duncker was arrested in February 1933 and remained in prison till November 1933. It was, perhaps, a tribute to the vigour with which his wife campaigned for his release from the penitentiary at Brandenburg that by the end of 1933 he was home. He lived under intense police surveillance till 1935 when he managed to escape, initially, to Denmark. The Duncker's elder son, Karl, went into exile in 1935, first to Cambridge in England, and then ending up in the United States. Their younger son, Wolfgang, also went into exile in 1935, relocating with his Swiss-born wife, Erika, to Moscow. During 1936 K√§te Duncker moved back from Berlin to Friedrichroda. In November 1936, she emigrated to the United States where she lived in a New York apartment block and was able to find work as a cleaner and as a language teacher. One of her reasons for choosing New York was to be close to her brilliant elder son who was believed to be unwell. The next few years were dominated by family tragedy. After 1935 her son Wolfgang worked in the movie industry in Moscow. He is described by one source as a follower of Nikolai Bukharin, however. This may or may not be why he was caught up in the purges of the time, disappearing, along with many other German political refugees in Moscow, in 1938. Her elder son was building a career as a notable Gestalt psychologist, by this time based at Swarthmore College near Philadelphia, and a couple of hours by train from New York. There are sources indicating that he had nevertheless been struggling with mental health issue of his own for some year: early in February 1940, shortly after his 37th birthday, following a series of \\"nervous breakdowns\\", Karl committed suicide. His mother was badly affected. She was nevertheless able to agitate successfully to obtain a US residence permit for her husband, at this point living precariously in semi-occupied France. He arrived \\"stateside\\" in September 1941. By this time K√§te Duncker had obtained a job teaching German at a high school. =Soviet occupation zone / German Democratic Republic= The Dunckers returned to Germany in 1947, settling first in Rostock and later in Bernau, just outside Berlin. Home was now part of the Soviet occupation zone, relaunched in October 1949 as the German Democratic Republic a new separated German state with its political and economic structures modelled on those of the Soviet Union. By now chronically ill, K√§te Duncker was no longer politically engaged, and never bothered to sign her communist party membership across to the new Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), which, following its creation in April 1946, quickly became the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. Nevertheless, on 2 June 1948 she wrote to her old friend and comrade, Wilhelm Pieck, imploring him to use his personal influence to find out what had happened to her younger son, Wolfgang. Like him, Wilhelm Pieck had moved to Moscow in 1935; unlike Wolfgang, he had survived, and was now a top German politician in the Soviet occupation zone. (In 1949 he became East Germany's first president.) On 10 November 1948 the Dunckers received a message from the Red Cross informing them that their younger son had died in Vorkuta on 20 November 1942. According to a detailed report submitted by his wife to the Central Committee of the exiled German Communist Party in Moscow on 22 September 1939, Wolfgang had been arrested on 21 March 1938 and interrogated. He had been forced, after four months, to sign a false confession, and then taken to a concentration camp where conditions had been grim. (Wolfgang's widow had survived the war, working in a (military) tank factory, and returned to the Soviet occupation zone in 1945 accompanied by her second husband and her two surviving children.) K√§te Duncker died at Bernau bei Berlin on 2 May 1953. Less than a year earlier she had called in a favour from another old comrade, writing on behalf of her friend, the journalist Jacob Walcher, to Walter Ulbricht. Walcher had been thrown out of the party because of doctrinal differences. It is not known whether Duncker's plea to Ulbricht in 1952 played any part in triggering her friend's formal rehabilitation in 1956. Celebration This memorial was removed from the public park at Friedrichroda in 2009 to clear the way for a new walkway. The East German state needed to find suitable heroes and heroines: K√§te Duncker evidently satisfied the criteria. Before 1990 a number of places had streets named after her. In Friedrichroda the street in which her mother had run a small guest house during the closing decades of the nineteenth century became \\"K√§te- Duncker-Stra√üe\\". Schools, Kindergarten, and even the teachers' training college she had attended in Eisenach were renamed in her honour. As recently as 2013 a mayoral candidate in Hanover was proposing that the street \\"Walderseestra√üe\\" should be renamed as \\"K√§te-Duncker-Stra√üe\\", as one of four street name changes intended to demonstrate that his city was liberal, progressive, and open to the world, having left its undemocratic national socialist and monarchist days behind. Inevitably, however, heroes of the German Democratic Republic lost a little of their lustre after the changes that led to the demise of the r√©gime, followed by German reunification in October 1990. In a public park (\\"Kurpark\\") in Friedrichroda the memorial statue showing Duncker as a teacher instructing three pupils was removed in 2009 in order to clear the way for a new walkway. (Nevertheless, unconfirmed assurances from town officials, briefly reported in the local press, indicated that it would be restored to the park, in an alternative location, some time round 2018.) On 15 October 2013 Germany's Die Linke (The Left) party renamed its meeting room at the Regional Parliament in Thuringia (where she sat as a Communist Party member in the 1920s) the \\"K√§te Duncker room\\" ().

Its aim was to \\"accompany young people on their way of life towards maturity so that, through a process of discernment, they can discover their life project and realize it with joy, opening the encounter with God and with men, and actively participating in the building up of the Church and society\\". Preparation The theme was chosen by Pope Francis after consulting the members of the Synod Council chosen by the previous Ordinary Assembly, regional and national bishops' conferences, the Union of Superiors Generals, the leaders of the Eastern Catholic Churches, and others. The theme, according to Francis, would allow for consideration of the decline in priestly vocations along with the broader question of discerning one's vocation. In January 2017, Pope Francis released a letter that invited \\"Young People\\" to contribute to the planning of the Synod. He wrote: In June 2017, Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri, Secretary General of the Synod of Bishops, announced the launch of a website to present the Synod's planning document accompanied by a questionnaire in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Italian to gather suggestions and feedback on it. He said he hoped to organize a gathering of youth in advance of the Synod. Its 53 questions, mostly multiple choice, were organized into seven sections and targeted at learning about local experiences specific to the younger generation. The planning document said that its working definition of young people meant ages 16 to 29 and that it was prioritizing communication with them: \\"In pastoral activity, young people are not objects but agents. Oftentimes, society sees them as nonessential or inconvenient. The Church cannot reflect such an attitude, because all young people, without exception, have the right to be guided in life's journey.\\" The Synod planning document posed another set of questions to bishops to assess how they minister to young people and included some questions targeted to specific geographic regions and asked, for example, about responding to \\"extreme violence\\" or working in a society that is \\"greatly secularized.\\" In early July, he reported that the questionnaire had received more than 60,000 responses and the website had generated 173,000 \\"contacts.\\" He said he hoped to reach \\"all young people, not only active Catholic young people.\\" In September, he hosted a seminar with about 20 teenagers and young adults to hear their ideas on the planned Synod. The participants were uninhibited in providing advice about topics and struggling to understand what the Synod proposed to accomplish. Participants Baldisseri announced in January 2017 that the Synod auditors, attendees without voting rights, would be young men and women carefully selected to represent the entire world and would participate as key advisers throughout the process to the Pope Francis and the Synod of Bishops. These young people were: # Gabin Dimtooum, Chad # Jonathan Lewis, United States of America # Sebastian Duhau, Australia # Safa Al Alqoshy, Iraq # Vincent Nneji, Nigeria # Emilie Callan, Canada # Julian Paparella, Canada # Joseph Sapati Moeono-Kolio, Samoa # Joseph Sapati Moeono-Kolio, New Zealand # Yithzak Gonzalez, Panama # Briana Santiago, Italy # Briana Santiago, United States of America # Nikki Perez, Philippines # Father Jules Boutros, Lebanon # Thomas Andonie, Germany # Anastasia Indrawan, Indonesia # Oksana Pimenova, Russian Federation # Corina Fiore, Mexico # Yadira Vieyra Alvarez, United States of America # Mariano Garcia, Argentina # Nathaniel Lamataki, New Caledonia # Sister Nathalie Becquart, France # Gioele Anni, Italy # Sylvia Retamales Morales, Chile # Margie le Hodey, Belgium # Tri Minh, Vietnam # Daniel Bashir, Pakistan # Percival Holt, India # Cherylanne Menezes, India Prelates assigned particular roles were: *Relator: Cardinal S√©rgio da Rocha, Archbishop of Brasilia *Secretaries: Giacomo Costa S.J. and Rossano Sala S.D.B *Presidents: Cardinals Louis Raphael I Sako (Iraq), D√©sir√© Tsarahazana (Madagascar), Charles Maung Bo SDB (Myanmar), John Ribat MSC (Papua New Guinea) The presidents alternate in presiding over the synod assemblies in place of the Pope, making assignments and managing the proceedings as necessary. Pope Francis appointed 29 prelates to supplement those elected by national and regional episcopal conferences. Working document The working document (instrumentum laboris) that guided the bishops' discussions was released in June 2018. It was intended to provide an overview of situations young people between 16 and 29 are facing around the world. It was developed after hearing from young people and bishops conferences. It states that \\"Young people feel a lack of harmony with the Church\\" and \\"It seems that we don‚Äôt understand the vocabulary, and therefore also the needs, of the young.\\" Throwaway culture, a special concern of Pope Francis, was discussed, as was death, corruption, war, and drug-trafficking. The document also lists friendship, fake news, and video games as topics along with migration and disabilities. Ecumenism and interreligious dialogue will also be discussed. The document discusses the challenges and opportunities the internet presents. The Church can reach young people through social media, it states, but it is also critical of video games and they way they \\"mold in young people a debatable vision of the human being and the world, nourishing a relational style based on violence.\\" It also highlights many of their positive features, including a desire to be involved in civic life, protection of the environment, and a desire to root out corruption and discrimination. The Synod took up young people's sexuality, including precocious sexuality, sexual promiscuity, digital pornography, the exhibition of one's body online, and sexual tourism, as \\"risk disfiguring the beauty and depth of emotional and sexual life\\". The concerns of gay youth \\"who, above all, want to remain close to the Church,\\" was a special concern. In the responses to the surveys, many LBGT youth said they wish to \\"‚Äòbenefit from a greater closeness‚Äô and experience greater care from the Church.\\" The document also insisted that the Church must be open and welcoming to all, including LGBT Catholics, those of other faiths, and those of no faith at all. Secretary General Lorenzo Baldisseri said at the release of the instrumentum that the Church is making an effort to engage the LGBT community because \\"we are open. We don't want to be closed in on ourselves.\\" The working document also acknowledges that ‚Äúcontroversial issues,‚Äù such as contraception, abortion, homosexuality, cohabitation, and marriage, are a ‚Äúsource of debate among youth, both inside the Church and in society.‚Äù While some find the Church's teaching to be a \\"source of joy,\\" those who differ from Church teaching's on these issues \\"still want to continue to be part of the Church and demand more clarity on it.\\" As a result, the synod fathers were asked to ‚Äúconfront, in a concrete way, controversial arguments such as homosexuality and the issues of gender, over which the young already argue with freedom and with no taboo.‚Äù The Synod will also discuss the challenges the Church sometimes has in explaining the Church's teaching on sexuality to contemporary society. Saying that \\"No bishops' conference offers solutions or recipes\\", the document says that \\"the question of sexuality must be discussed more openly and without prejudice.\\" Research cited in the document shows that young people face discrimination because of their gender, social class, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, geographical position, disability, or ethnicity. Young people also \\"report the persistence of religious discrimination, especially against Christians.\\" The instrumentum reported that the surveys called for a Church that is \\"committed to justice,\\" willing to discuss the role of women, that has homilies that are more relevant to their lives and their discernment, and a liturgy that is ‚Äúalive and close‚Äù to them. The church must accompany young people in their lives, the document states, as education and evangelization are an ‚Äúecclesial duty and a right of each young person.‚Äù Young people reported that the Church can often seem distant, and desire a Church that is close, transparent, and up to date. The Church is also being called to listen to youth, according to the document, and to discuss difficult issues. The working document stated that scandals in the Church and society, as well as a perception that \\"many times the Church seems to be too severe and often associated to an excessive moralism,\\" are causing young people to leave the Church. The document acknowledges these \\"serious and respectable reasons,\\" and that too often the young have been assigned a \\"passive role within the Christian community.\\" Young people report wanting a more active role in the leadership of the church. =Committees= On 3 October, Synod members representing a wide range of views were elected to serve on the Synod's \\"Information Committee\\", which controls the release of information to the press and public. Each of five regions held its own election: America, Africa, Asia, Europe and Oceania. A second election on 9 October, again by region, chose members of the committee responsible for drafting the Synod's concluding document. This election, again by region, produced a less diverse group more attuned to Francis in style and views, though when Francis made three additional appointments as the rules provided he avoided figures who are controversial for their espousal of less traditional views and instead used his selections to provide other kinds of diversity: the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, a Cuban priest, and a junior Vatican official. Final document Apostolic exhortation Drawing on the Synod's document on discussions, Pope Francis authored an apostolic exhortation, Christus Vivit (Christ is living), which he signed on 25 March 2019. The text of the document was published on 2 April 2019, the anniversary of the death of Pope John Paul II, who was \\"the first Pope to address a letter to young people in 1985 and he was the Pope who began the World Youth Days\\". The Vatican also provided a summary of Christus Vivit by Andrea Tornielli. Francis acknowledged the church's history of promoting male domination and clerical protection of members of the Church who committed the abuse of power, the abuse of conscience, sexual and financial abuse against women and children. He wrote that the church had to repair its reputation with young people or risk becoming \\"a museum\\". He also acknowledged abuses committed \\"by some bishops, priests, religious and laypersons\\" and asked young people to hold priests accountable by reminding them of their vows and vocations. The Apostolic Exhortation included several references to the work of the Auditors who provided key advice and played a pivotal role during this process, including a quote from the Samoan auditor Joseph Sapati Moeono-Kolio which Pope Francis used to summarise Chapter Six: \\"During the Synod, one of the young auditors from the Samoan Islands spoke of the Church as a canoe, in which the elderly help to keep on course by judging the position of the stars, while the young keep rowing, imagining what waits for them ahead. Let us steer clear of young people who think that adults represent a meaningless past, and those adults who always think they know how young people should act. Instead, let us all climb aboard the same canoe and together seek a better world, with the constantly renewed momentum of the Holy Spirit.\\" See also * Synod of Bishops in the Catholic Church Notes References External links * * Synod documents Category:Synod of bishops in the Catholic Church Category:2018 in Vatican City Category:21st-century Catholicism Category:Pope Francis ","title":"Fifteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops"},{"id":"51885469","text":"The 1975 Miami Hurricanes football team represented the University of Miami for the 1975 NCAA Division I football season.

Core prevention  A number of combined practices such as improved hand hygiene, enhanced barrier protection and reduced catheter use when managing incontinence appear to reduce CAUTI. Urinary catheters should be inserted using aseptic technique and sterile equipment (including sterile gloves, drape, sponges, antiseptic and sterile solution), particularly in an acute care setting. Although catheter use should be minimized in all patients, particularly those at higher risk of CAUTI and mortality (e.g. the elderly or those with impaired immunity), a meta analysis suggests there is insufficient evidence to determine the value of different policies for replacing long term urinary catheters on patient outcomes. Incidence Bacteria and yeast, including those naturally occurring as part of the human microbiome, can grow within biofilm that forms along the surface of urinary catheters. This leads to infection in the bladder, kidneys, and other organs connected to the urinary tract. CAUTI can lead to complications such as prostatitis, epididymitis, and orchitis in men, and cystitis, pyelonephritis, gram-negative bacteremia, endocarditis, vertebral osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, endophthalmitis, and meningitis in all patients. Complications associated with CAUTI cause discomfort to the patient, prolonged hospital stay, and increased cost and mortality.

Ali won the bout, his first at the current Madison Square Garden, through a technical knockout in the 15th round. According to Ferdie Pacheco, Ali absorbed more punishment in this particular fight than in any of his previous fights, and it was a mistake for Ali to have fought with Bonavena just before his first fight with Joe Frazier. Background Many experts believed Ali was making a mistake by fighting with Bonavena in only his second fight after his 3¬Ω year break from professional boxing. Christened \\"The Bull\\" by the press, Bonavena was a hard puncher; he was the only boxer at this time who had gone the full distance with Joe Frazier in two hard fought fights, knocking down Frazier twice in the first bout, and forcing Frazier on the defensive in the final rounds of the second bout. Thirty-seven of Bonavena's previous forty-five boxing opponents had been knocked out. Buildup At the weigh-in, it was Bonavena who took the initiative of indulging in psychological warfare. In broken English, Bonavena shouted to Ali: \\"You cheekeen...You no go in Army.\\" Continuing with the verbal tirade, Bonavena went on to call Ali a \\"black kangaroo\\", indicated that Ali had hygiene problems, and, using an old Sonny Liston line, accused Ali of being a homosexual. Ali was left to making gestures indicating Bonavena was crazy. After the weigh-in,however, Ali began his own psychological attack by turning up unannounced in Bonavena's dressing room and shouting hysterically at his opponent until he was ejected by Bonavena's entourage from the room. On the day of the fight Ali announced: The fight =Rounds 1‚Äì3= For the first three rounds it was a vintage Ali repelling the brave but crude Bonavena. Jos√© Torres, who witnessed the bout,wrote that in the first round of the fight Ali looked like a bullfighter and Bonavena like a bull. Torres went on to write: =Rounds 4‚Äì8= In the middle of round 4, Ali began to tire and retreated to the ropes; Bonavena now had a stationary target to hit. From rounds 4 through 8 of the fight, Ali continued defensive boxing with Bonavena stalking him relentlessly. Leaning back against the ropes, Ali started depending on his reflexes rather than his feet to avoid Bonavena's punches. However, the body shots Bonavena was throwing at Ali started connecting with some regularity. The fight became insipid with Bonavena pursuing Ali, but lacking the requisite technique to end the bout. =Round 9= Prior to the match, Ali had predicted that round 9 would be the final round of this bout. As it turned out, both fighters would keep punching each other throughout this round. The round began with Ali landing a strong punch on Bonavena's jaw, but as Ali moved in purposefully, the bout became a slugging contest with Bonavena hitting back. In the melee, Bonavena's hook found Ali's jaw, and Ali was hurt. Reflecting on this moment in the fight, Ali later observed: =Rounds 10‚Äì14= After the fiercely contested ninth round, the fight degenerated into an insipid affair with Ali engaging in defensive boxing. As Torres wrote: =Round 15= In the final round of the bout, Bonavena, realizing that he needed a knockout to win the match, started throwing a barrage of punches at Ali. As Bonavena was preparing to throw a right at Ali, he was suddenly beaten to the punch by Ali's left hook and knocked down. Bonavena got up and was knocked down again; he got up a third time and was again knocked down by Ali after which the fight was stopped. Bonavena's trainer Gil Clancy remembered: Aftermath After the fight, Ali grabbed a microphone and shouted: Ali's next boxing match would be with Joe Frazier. Bonavena would later die under tragic circumstances in 1976.

This scale was first proposed by Axel Fugl-Meyer and his colleagues as a standardized assessment test for post-stroke recovery in their paper titled The post-stroke hemiplegic patient: A method for evaluation of physical performance. It is now widely used for clinical assessment of motor function. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment score has been tested several times, and is found to have excellent consistency, responsivity and good accuracy. The maximum possible score in Fugl-Meyer scale is 226, which corresponds to full sensory-motor recovery. The minimal clinically important difference of Fugl-Meyer assessment scale is 6 for lower limb in chronic stroke and 9-10 for upper limb in sub-acute stroke. Development In 1975, Axel Fugl-Meyer noted that it is difficult to quantify the efficacy of different rehabilitation strategies because of the lack of a numerical scoring system. He and his colleagues developed an assessment scale to overcome this problem. The construction of this scale was based on the then existing knowledge about recovery patterns in stroke. Fugl- Meyer was particularly influenced by the 1951 paper authored by Thomas Twitchell, titled The Restoration of Motor Functioning Following Hemiplegia in Man and observations on post-stroke patients by Signe Brunnstrom. In the motor scale of Fugl-Meyer assessment, items were generated based on the ontology and stages of stroke recovery described by Twitchell and Brunnstrom respectively. When knowledge regarding Stroke recovery increased significantly in the late 20th century and early 21st century, Twitchell and Brunnstrom models were not sufficient to explain the motor recovery following stroke. However, Fugl-Meyer test still holds good, possibly because it follows a hierarchical scoring system based on the level of difficulty in performing the tasks. Scoring The Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale is an ordinal scale that has 3 points for each item. A zero score is given for the item if the subject cannot do the task. A score of 1 is given when the task is performed partially and a score of 2 is given when the task is performed fully. However, reflex activity is measured using 2 points only, with a score of 0 or 2 for absence and presence of reflex respectively. The five domains assessed by Fugl-Meyer scale are: * Motor function (Maximum score in upper limb = 66; Maximum score in lower limb = 34) * Sensory function (Maximum score = 24) * Balance (Maximum score = 14) * Range of motion of joints (Maximum score = 44) * Joint pain (Maximum score = 44) The maximum total score that can be obtained in Fugl Meyer assessment is 226, though it is common practice to assess all domains separately. The test can be completed in around 40 minutes. To perform the test, the examiner needs a tennis ball, a small spherical shaped container and knee hammer. Limitations The Fugl-Meyer scale has only three levels of assessment for each item. Therefore, a majority of patients get an intermediate score in most items, and remain so for a long time. The test is also reported to have ceiling effect in the sensation domain and floor effect in the balance domain. Some researchers report that Fugl Meyer assessment is time consuming.

The villa was built as a private family residence. Part of the property is privately owned, while most of it belongs to the Roman Catholic Church. At one point the Franciscan friars named their part of the property as Dar Frate Francesco and was later renamed a number of times. The building has primarily served as a shelter for the homeless. Since the early 1980s the friars converted their residence into a home for local minors with social difficulties. It later served as a residence for unaccompanied child refugees, from 2001 till 2006. A chapel known as Blessed Nazju Falzon Chapel was inaugurated in early 2001, within the building. The home was then re- inaugurated by Lawrence Gonzi after extensive structural work. The interior of the building was modified, however keeping the original fa√ßade. It was renovated again in 2006 to host migrant families, but the home has been shut down since 2010. The chapel closed in early 2017. It is currently undergoing renovation. History Origin of name and construction date are visibe on the fa√ßade Villa Lauri was completed in 1945 (A.D. MCMXLV) as a residential building, at 55 [Don Gaetano] Mannarino Road in Birkirkara, BKR 08. Part of the property became in possession of the Roman Catholic Church and has since then been administered by the Order of Friars Minor (OFM). The villa has an imposing fa√ßade and was one of the first structures to be built on the present road. Other buildings were constructed in the period when the area saw a community growth, as Malta was a British colony. The oldest still standing building in the area is found round the corner of the villa in Filippo Borgia Street, that is the Tal-Wejter Tower, which was built during the Order of St. John. Evidence of the early growing population in the areas during the British period is some of the surrounding buildings and structures such as the Birkirkara Station, the now Birkirkara Station Garden, and a number of cinemas, including the close by Roxy Cinema. =Home= After the villa was sold from the original owners and large part of the property became in possession of the church, the property of the church was named Dar Frate Francesco by the Franciscan Friars. Dar Frate Francesco entrance in 2016 In 1981 the residential part of the house was modified to accommodate youth with social difficulties that may face social problems for multiple reasons. Since then the main part of the building has served as a home generally for youth, with the exception for a short lived home for African migrant families. The home opened its doors for the youth in 1981, on the initiative of the founder Adrijan Cachia (OFM). During its mission as a home over 600 youth (between 10 and 13 years) residents have received temporal stay at the villa and admittance was irrelevant to religious belief of the clients. It was administered by two Roman Catholic priests and a number of secular workers. Cachia was the first director of the home and was later succeeded by Father P. Eddie Pace (OFM), and last was Father John Abela. The youth were provided with a bedroom (alone or shared) and access to most of the house as common space. The house provided for the needs of the residents, such as a better alternative in the lack of family environment and a social worker as a social reference support. This aimed to prepare the youth for independent living. More government funds, for works and service, were given in 1994. On 9 January (1998) Giacomo Bini, the Minister General of the OFM, was received by Pace at the building for breakfast. Beatu Nazju Falzon Chapel, on the left-side The villa received prominence at national level since the 1980s and more recently in 2001, when the lack of finance put at risk for the closure of the home. On 14 March of that year the Friars reached an agreement with the Ministry of Social Services, housed at Palazzo Ferreria, to receive financial social services from the Government of Malta and other sources. An agreement was reached under notary Eugene Montanaro with the condition that the home works hand in hand with Aƒ°enzija Appoƒ°ƒ°. Soon after the agreement, the house was restructured and upgraded with modern facilities at a financial cost of Lm 50,000, of which Lm 31,148 were allocated from Appoƒ°ƒ° with finance paid by the government of Malta. The home was then still run by the Friars, but also assisted by Programme Manager Anna Maria Laurenti, who received her studies in London. The part of the property used for religious services was kept and restructured, and was this time open as Blessed Nazju Falzon Chapel. Falzon is a beatified Maltese and this house-church is the first and only place of worship dedicated to him. The chapel within the property has its own entrance and was inaugurated to the public on 30 May 2001 by provincial Bernard Bartolo. St Anne house is a private family residence, the right-side of the villa Lawrence Gonzi has given his political support for the maintenance of the home in order to remain functional and keep aiding people in need. After several projects at the house, Gonzi has re-inaugurated the home on 22 November 2001 in a public ceremony. Among those present was Joseph \\"Joe\\" Gerada, the Executive Head of Agenzija Appogg at the time. Along the years, even if the name of the home remained to be known as Dar Frate Francesco, the home has changed name a number of times such as Formula One and Dar il- Qawsalla (meaning Rainbow House). Refugees were given opportunities to receive free basic education at the building, provided by the Education Ministry, with an emphasis to learn the English language. As the number of parentless youth refugees requesting shelter dropped drastically, from January 2006 the home started receiving adult refugees consisting of families and lonely mothers with children. In 2009 the home saw some moderate renovation, with the voluntarily work of sailors from the USS Barry (DDG-52). The home was a registered NGO and was occasionally open to the public. Villa Lauri includes the home (Dar Frate Francesco), the prayer house (Beatu Falzon Chapel) and a private residence (St Anne house). Since the building of the villa, the three parts together have always been known as simply the villa and known to the locals as Villa Lauri. The home was shut down on 19 December 2010 soon after the loss of Fr Abela. At some point it served as a temporary shelter for former prisoners and drug abusers. It was occasionally used for meetings by people with blindness disability. The house-church was open to the public. There were daily masses at 17:30 and till it closed in 2017 the chaplain was John Azzopardi (OFM). =Other= In the early morning of 4 February 2016, an unknown driver hit a van on the move in Mannarino Road, when driving his Volkswagen vehicle. As a consequence of the collision, the van then crashed into a showroom, forming part of a block of apartments next to Villa Lauri, which missed from damaging the front of the villa by a close proximity. Architecture USS Barry (DDG 52) stationed in Malta, in 2009. The sailors made some voluntarily work at the villa. The building has a Neoclassic fa√ßade, with some Art Nouveau features. The building‚Äôs main features are the neoclassic columns and its spacious front terraces. It is presently divided into 2/3 parts: the chapel and Dar Frate Francesco that is the main residence which together are simply called Frate Franceso and belong to the Roman Catholic Church, and a privately owned residence. The interior of the building was extensively modified, when the refurbishment of the chapel and the home took place, and the exterior remains unaltered.

He is also a professor of religion at Syracuse University.  Education  Braiterman received his B.A. from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies (1988), and his Ph.D. from Stanford University, Department of Religious Studies (1995). Scholarship Braiterman's scholarship on the role of theodicy in Holocaust theology has drawn responses from other theologians. In his 1998 book (God) After Auschwitz: Tradition and Change in Post-Holocaust Jewish Thought, he coined the term antitheodicy for a refusal to connect God with evil or a refusal to justify God. Dan Garner believed this philosophy \\"significantly advanced\\" the scholarship of Holocaust theology. Theologian and feminist scholar Melissa Raphael suggested that it could form the basis of a theology more focused on culture and community than concerns about the existence of evil, and literary theorist Brendan Cooper concluded that the concept could be applied in wider contexts, employing it for analysis of John Berryman's The Dream Songs. Other scholars were more critical. Peter Admirand of the Mater Dei Institute of Education agreed with Braiterman's assessment of postmodernist influences on Jewish theology, but rejected the idea that theodic arguments concerning the Holocaust are required to \\"defend[] the indefensible.\\" Sarah Pinnock criticized his definition of antitheodicy as unhelpful because it is overbroad, encompassing \\"any and all attempts to give religious meaning to evil and suffering\\". Braiterman has also written extensively on the topic of Jewish art within the Jewish aniconic tradition. According to Martina Urban's review of his 2007 book The Shape of Revelation: Aesthetics and Modern Jewish Thought, he argues that religious revelation and visual art \\"do not constitute two radicually divergent discourses\\" because religion can inspire images indirectly in the same manner as expressionist painting. Raphael described him as connecting Jewish \\"aural\\" culture with visual media derived from Hellenic art traditions. Braiterman has also described the \\"deadening\\" of feeling in some Jewish art in the post-Holocaust era, such as in the works of Anselm Kiefer. Employment As of 2016, Braiterman is a professor of religion at Syracuse University. His paper in the journal Religious Education, discussing methods of teaching Jewish topics to a largely non-Jewish audience, received a critical response that argued he was taking too postmodernist and secular an approach to religious studies. In addition to his career in academia, Braiterman has written articles about religion and culture for The Daily Beast and Huffington Post.

She was also the mother (or sister) of Ismenus, god of the Theban river of the same name. Melia was an important cult figure at Thebes. She was worshipped at the Ismenion, the Temple of Apollo at Thebes, and was associated with a nearby spring. Mythology The late 6th‚Äìearly 5th century BC Theban poet Pindar tells us that Melia, a daughter of Oceanus, was, by Apollo, the mother of the Theban hero and prophet Tenerus.Larson, pp. 40-41, 142; Pindar, Paean 9 fr. 52k 34‚Äì46 (Race 1997b, pp. 292-295; Rutherford, pp. 191-192); also Strabo, 9.2.34, which says that the \\"Teneric Plain\\" was named after Tenerus the son of Melia and Apollo. Elsewhere he refers to her as \\"Melia of the golden spindle\\".Pindar, fr. 29 1 (Race 1997b, pp. 232, 233). The 2nd century AD Greek geographer Pausanias provides a more complete account. Larson, p. 142; Schachter 1967, p. 4; Fontenrose pp. 317-318; Pausanias, 9.10.5, 6, 9.26.1. According to Pausanias, Melia was abducted, and Melia's father Oceanus ordered his son Caanthus to find her. Caanthus found Melia at Thebes being held by Apollo, but unable to get Melia away from Apollo, Caanthus set fire to Apollo's sanctuary, and Apollo shot and killed him. Pausanius says that, in addition to Tenerus, to whom Apollo gave the \\"art of divination\\", Melia had another son by Apollo, Ismenus, after whom the Theban river Ismenus was named.Pausanias, 9.10.6; c.f. Pindar, fr. 29 1 (Race 1997b, pp. 232, 233). For the Theban Ismenus river, see Berman, p. 18. The story of Melia and Caanthus, as recorded by Pausainus, is a close parallel to the more famous story of Europa and Cadmus, the founder and first king of Thebes. Like Melia, Europa is abducted by an Olympian god (in this case Zeus), and her brother Cadmus is sent by their father to bring Europa back home, and like Caanthus, Cadmus is unsuccessful.Larson, p. 142, describes the story as \\"clearly a doublet of the better-known myth\\" of Cadmus and Europa; Schachter 1967, p. 4, calls Melia's story an \\"imitation\\" of the story of Cadmus and Europa; see also Schachter 1981, p. 79; Fontenrose, p. 318. Compare with the story of the Theban Amphion (see below). As noted by Fontenrose, there are other apparent congruences between the Theban Melia and Europa.Fontenrose, p. 318. Like Melia, Europa was also the name of an Oceanid,Hesiod, Theogony 357; Andron of Halicarnassus fr. 7 Fowler = FGrHist 10 F 7 (Fowler 2013, p. 13). and Agenor, the usual father of Europa, had, according to the fifth-century BC mythographer Pherecydes, a daughter named Melia who was a wife of Danaus,Gantz, p. 208; Pherecydes fr. 21 Fowler 2000, p. 289 = FGrHist 3 F 21 = Scholia on Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 3.1177-87f. while, according to the mythographer Apollodrus, one of Danaos' wife's was also named Europa.Apollodorus, 2.1.5. There were apparently other versions of this Theban Melia's story.Schachter 1967, p. 4. In some traditions perhaps, the Thebans Melia and Ismenus were siblings, rather than mother and son. A scholiast on Pindar says that Ismenus was Melia's brother.Larson, p. 304 n. 57; Fontenrose, p. 319; Scholia on Pindar, Pythian 11.5‚Äì6 (Drachmann, pp. 254-255). According to the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, the first fratricide occurred at Thebes when Melia's brothers, Ismenus and Claaitus (a corruption or variant of Caanthus?) fought over her.Schachter 1967, p. 4; Fontenrose, p. 319; Oxyrhynchus Papyri X 1241.4.5-10 (Grenfell and Hunt, pp. 104: Greek text, 109: translation, 110: commentary). A version of Melia's story perhaps also involved the Theban Amphion.Schachter 1967, p. 4. Pherecydes says that Melia was the name of one of the daughters of Amphion and his wife Niobe,Fowler 2013, p. 367; Schachter 1967, p. 4; Pherecydes fr. 126 Fowler 2000, p. 342 = FGrHist 3 F 126 = Scholia on Euripides, Phoenician Women 159. while later sources tell us that Ismenus was the name of one of their sons.Schechter 1967, p. 4; Apollodorus, 3.5.6; Ovid, Metamorphoses 6.221-224; Hyginus, Fabulae 11 (Smith and Trzaskoma, p. 100). Like Caanthus, Amphion was shot and killed by Apollo because of an attack on his temple.Hyginus, Fabulae 9 (Smith and Trzaskoma, p. 99). The 3rd century BC poet Callimachus appears to make this Theban Melia, rather than a daughter of Oceanus, one of the \\"earth-born\\" Meliae, the ash tree nymphs, who, according to Hesiod, were born, along with the Erinyes and the Giants, from Gaia (Earth) and the blood of Uranus (Sky), which dripped on Gaia when Uranus was castrated by his son Cronus. Larson, p. 142; Callimachus, Hymn 4‚ÄîTo Delos 79‚Äì85 with note i; Hesiod, Theogony 187. According to the mythographer Apollodorus, the mother of Phoroneus, and Aegialeus, by her brother, the river god Inachus, was also a daughter of Oceanus named Melia.Grimal, s.v. Melia 2, p. 281; Apollodorus, 2.1.1. =Cult= Melia was an important object of cult worship at the Ismenion, the major sanctuary of Apollo Ismenios at Thebes.Larson, p. 142; Berman, pp. 64, 124; Schachter 1967, p. 5, which calls her an \\"important component of the cult complex\\" at the Ismenion; for the Ismenion, and the cult of Melia, see Schachter 1981, pp. 77-88 (Melia: p. 78); Schachter 1967, pp. 3-5. In at least three separate poems, Pindar mentions Melia in connection with the Theban sanctuary. In one he refers to the Ismenion and \\"the splendid hall of Oceanus‚Äô daughter . . . Melia\\".Pindar, Paean 7 fr. 52g (Race 1997b, pp. 278, 279 ; Rutherford, p. 339). In another, Pindar summons the local heroines, the daughters of Cadmus, Semele and Ino Leucothea, along with the mother of Heracles, to \\"join Melia at the treasury of the golden tripods,\\"Larson, p. 142; Rutherford, p. 341; Pindar, Pythian 11.4-6 (Race 1997a, pp. 380, 381); c.f. Herodotus, 1.52. that is in the adyton, the inner inviolate sanctuary of the Ismenion where the votive tripods were dedicated.Schachter 2016, p. 267, which further supposes that Melia would have had a cult image, perhaps made of ash wood; see also Schachter 1981, pp. 82-83; Schachter 1967, p. 5. Also at the Ismenion, Pindar locates the \\"immortal couch [ŒªŒ≠œáŒµŒπ] of Melia\\",Pindar, Paean 9 fr. 52k 35 (Race 1997b, pp. 292-293; Rutherford, p. 191). the child- bed, where Melia gave birth.Berman, p. 64; Rutherford, pp. 196, 341. A spring near the Ismenion was identified with Melia, perhaps the source of the Ismenus river, and perhaps the same spring as the one mentioned by Pausanias as the spring, above the Ismenion, by which her brother Caanthus was buried.Larson, p. 142; Schachter 1967, p. 5 with note 30; Fontenrose, p. 318; Scholia on Pindar Pythian 11.6 (Drachmann, p. 255), which says the spring had the same name as the \\"heroine\\" Melia, daughter of Oceanus; Pausanias, 9.10.5. The Thebans traced their descent from the union of Apollo and Melia, through the heroes Tenerus and Ismenus. According to Larson, while their descent from Apollo--a panhellenic Olympian god--increased their prestige, and connected them to other Greeks, their descent from Melia--a nymph associated with the local landscape--helped to establish their connection with the land that they inhabited.Larson, pp. 40-41.

It was released on August 7, 2015, on Blueberry Records and was released to high critical acclaim from various critics. Background Crampton began composing American Drift in 2012 while living in Roanoke and Richmond, Virginia, and was further producing the album in La Paz, Bolivia in 2014. The album was created as part of a project to describe the experience of prehistoric and precolonial history in direct relation to African-American history and Aymara history, as well as Christian faith and ontology. Crampton was inspired by Southern hip hop and crunk, Bolivian and Peruvian prog, metal and psych, trival/tribal- guarachero, black spirituals and early blues, psychedelic folk, and neo- classical music, as well as her brother's avant-garde records, and her grandfather's collection of huayno and cumbia tapes. She also cited late writer Jos√© Esteban Mu√±oz's writings on brownness, which she correlated with the Earth and its geology. In press photos for American Drift, Crampton was often depicted in forest settings, as well as holding a copy of Stacy Alaimo's Bodily Natures: Science, Environment, and the Material Self. Concept The Shenandoah Mountain in Virginia served as a geographical and geological inspiration for American Drift. Crampton described both herself and American Drift as taking a transevangelistic approach. The title track, written for and spoken by her collaborator Money Allah (who also appears on \\"Wing\\"), is set as a transevangelistic prayer. Lyrically, it references Paul Claudel's poetic cycle \\"The Way of the Cross\\" and the Christian hymn \\"Rock of Ages\\", and depicts the \\"wildly disanthropocentric\\" transformation of natural settings. \\"Petrichrist\\"'s name is a portmanteau of petrichor and Christ, and musically documents Crampton herself driving in her Ford Ranger up the Shenandoah Mountain in Virginia, intended as a depiction of \\"an encounter between mountain and vehicle, interactions of non-human objects touching one another in a Worlding where all things have agency.\\" \\"Wing\\" is a piece in two parts based on particular natural cycles in prehistory; it portrays an impact event, leading into \\"negative photosynthesis\\" and finally fern spikes; the track is also dedicated to black pianist Margaret Bonds, whose piano pieces were formulative on the album among Crampton's influences. \\"Axacan\\" is named for and musically depicts the Ajac√°n Mission, where the first Spanish settlement in Virginia occurred violently. Composition Alongside the influences laid out in the press release of the album, American Drift uses a distinct keyboard-based rich musical palette, including ambient pads, woodwinds and horns, and Hollywood-style stock sound effects including vocal bites, explosions, alerts, gunshots, beeps and evil laughs. These sounds are often arranged atmospherically or rhythmically in juxtaposition with the otherwise polyphonic and minimalist tone of the music, and in particular, Crampton's style of sound collages with such samples has been dubbed as \\"epic collage\\". Crampton's collaborator, Money Allah, who speaks and sings on the title track and \\"Wing\\", is described as a \\"thug dove\\". On \\"Petrichrist\\" and \\"Wing\\", rhythm samples reminiscent of Baile funk are used alongside cumbia patterns, and on \\"Axacan\\", samples are interspersed with rhythms recalling Andean khantus music. The album is punctuated with vocal samples and synths that refer back to Southern rap and crunk, including \\"yup!\\"s and, on \\"Axacan\\", vocal bites of rapper Lil Jon saying \\"yeahhh!\\", \\"what!\\" and \\"okayyy!\\". In correlation, the second section of \\"Wing\\" is described as a 'crunk-huayno ballad'. Guitars, flutes and horns that appear to be played on Kurzweil and Yamaha keyboards appear throughout, as well as similarly electronic-sounding bells, chimes and ambient pads that, according to Nick James Scavo of Tiny Mix Tapes, set an Appalachian scene. Philip Sherburne, writing for Pitchfork, described American Drift as artistically evoking \\"a hillside that's been worn away by erosion to reveal a sedimentary record of the millennia\\". He also commented on the album's use of 'woodblock rhythms', \\"trap chants\\" and \\"coruscating organs\\", praising them, as elements of the record, as being 'overwhelming in the best way.' Nick James Scavo, writing for Tiny Mix Tapes, commented that 'the beauty of Crampton's art is that it gorgeously describes a drifting, transitional nature ‚Äî to pin it down is to forget its essence, to rob it of movement.' Scavo also stated that the album artistically \\"evoke[s] the biologically self- queering nature of the \\"sublime\\" [and] approaches the \\"opening\\" of Crampton‚Äôs sound as a trans-ontology\\".

Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17 (1993), is a US labor law case in which the Supreme Court of the United States clarified the definition of a \\"hostile\\" or \\"abusive\\" work environment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the Court held that a determination about whether a work environment is hostile or abusive requires a consideration of all relevant circumstances.. Facts Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that it is \\"an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\\" Teresa Harris claimed that the President of Forklift Systems, Inc, Charles Hardy, discriminated against her and subjected her to sexual innuendo at work on multiple occasions, including in front of other employees. She was a manager at the equipment rental company, between April 1985 and October 1987. Harris first complained directly to Hardy about his behavior in August 1987, and he claimed that he was kidding and apologized to Harris. After Harris complained, Hardy said that he would stop that kind of behavior, so Harris stayed at the job. However, in September, Hardy started harassing her again in front of other employees. Harris got her paycheck and quit her job at Forklift Systems, Inc. on October 1. After quitting, Harris sued Forklift Systems, Inc. Harris claimed that Hardy's behavior made an abusive work environment for her based on her gender under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Judgment =District Court of Tennessee= The United States District Court for the District of Tennessee stated that Hardy's behavior did not make a cruel work environment for Harris. The District claimed that Hardy's conduct would have made any \\"reasonable woman\\" uncomfortable but would not have affected their psychological well being and performance at work. The District Court held that the evidence presented by Harris was not sufficient to show that Hardy's behavior actually affected the conditions of her employment; therefore, there was no Title VII violation. =Sixth Circuit, Court of Appeals= The United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, affirmed the District Court's decision. It said a ‚Äòhostile environment‚Äô had to ‚Äòseriously affect psychological well-being‚Äô or mean the plaintiff ‚Äòsuffer injury‚Äô. =Supreme Court= The US Supreme Court, reversing the Court's below, held an abusive environment ‚Äòthat does not seriously affect employees‚Äô psychological well-being can and often will detract from... job performance, discourage employees from staying on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers.‚Äô If the environment ‚Äòwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive‚Äô this is enough.

He was the basis for the character Juanito Montoyo in Ernest Hemingway's novel The Sun Also Rises.M.C. Rintoul , Dictionary of Real People and Places in Fiction, Routledge, Mar 5, 2014 Life in Pamplona Quintana was born in Pamplona, Spain in 1891, the eldest of three children of Ignacio Quintana Barreneche and Saturnina Urra Vizcar. His father worked as a postman. Quintana opened the Quintana Hotel at 18 Plaza del Castillo in Pamplona. The bullfighters who came to Pamplona usually stayed in the hotel. Juanito Quintana was a big aficionado and worked as an entrepreneur organizing bullfights. Between 1926 and 1930 he was president of Club Taurino in Pamplona. Quintana married Juana Mantec√≥n Iturri (1911-1999) and had a son, Juan.Fernando P√©rez Ollo, \\"Quintana, hotelero amigo\\", Diario de Navarra, 2 de julio de 1999, p. 51. Spanish Civil War and World War II During the Second Spanish Republic Quintana was a prominent Republican sympathizer and political organizing often took place in his hotel. In July 1936, at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, Quintana was away from Pamplona, because he had gone to Mont-de-Marsan to see bullfights, which saved him from being a victim of repression against Republicans, but his hotel was requisitioned by the new authorities and he could never get it back. He settled for some years in France, where his brother Alberto ran a hotel in the town of Biarritz. In 1941 both brothers were able to return to Spain and settled in San Sebasti√°n. During World War II Alberto Quintana was part of the Comet line, which helped Allied soldiers and airmen return to Britain during the Second World War after crossing the Basque-Navarre border on the way to Gibraltar. Friendship with Ernest Hemingway Juanito Quintana is known for his friendship with the writer Ernest Hemingway. In 1924, when Hemingway was in Madrid, the bullfighting critic Rafael Hernandez advised him to go to the festival of San Fermin in Pamplona and stay at the Hotel Quintana, where he could enjoy the best bullfighting atmosphere. He did, and Hemingway and Quintana struck up a close friendship which only ended with the writer's death. Hemingway stayed at the Hotel Quintana on his visits to Pamplona in 1924, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1929 and 1931. Quintana appears embodied in the character of Juanito Montoya, owner of the Hotel Montoya in the novel The Sun Also Rises of 1926. In the fifties, after a long absence from Spain, Hemingway returned and resumed their relationship. The Hotel Quintana no longer existed, but Juanito Quintana arranged accommodation on their visits to Pamplona in 1953 and 1959, and accompanied Hemingway in his travels through several cities, united by their love of bullfighting. Hemingway refers to him in Death in the Afternoon: ‚ÄúQuintana, the best aficionado and most loyal friend in Spain, and with a fine hotel with all the rooms full‚Äù.  Bibliography  * James A.

It was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places on May 1, 1979. with The district is located at Highway 74 along Bear Creek. Overview The seven-acre conference center is owned by the Evergreen Music Conference, the Sisters of St. Mary's, and the Episcopal Church of the Transfiguration. The oldest continuing music center in the United States, in operation since 1907, has 23 buildings that include the Stone Library, Meeting House, St. Raphael's, and the Bell Tower. According to History Colorado it is significant for its: * appearance of early 20th century Evergreen and architectural features, * connection with Canon Charles Winfield Douglas, an expert on the plainsong mass, and * association with music, education, religion, and social/humanitarian activity History The land on which the district resides had been Ute, Arapaho, and Cheyenne hunting grounds. Traders and fur trappers passed through the land by 1821 and prospectors entered the area during the gold rush beginning in 1858. Bergen Park was established in 1859 when Thomas Cunningham Bergen built a log cabin and named his property. In 1877 Evergreen became its own place, unique from Bergen Park, in 1877 when Amos Post opened a trading post, followed by a general store, on what is now Evergreen's main street. He married Sarah Bergan, Thomas' daughter. The area was first called Evergreen when D.P. Wilmot expressed his admiration of the firs, spruce, and pines on the land he acquired about 1875 in Buffalo Park. Ranchers, loggers and farmers established themselves along Bear Creek. City dwellers established summer retreats in the mountainous region. Denver Mountain Parks between Morrison and Golden was established in 1991, which brought more people to the area during the summer. In the 1880s a log bunkhouse was constructed for the use of lumbermen. Robert H. Stewart converted it into a hotel by 1872. He added eight guest cottages and called his property Sprucedale Resort. The first church meetings were held in the area in 1872. Mary Neosho Williams, widow of Civil War General Thomas Williams, created a retreat center beginning in 1893 that ultimately evolved into the Evergreen Conference Center when she began holding Episcopal church services in tents. She purchased Stewart Hotel, which was transformed into St. Mark's in the Wilderness church, later Mission of the Transfiguration. Her daughter, Dr. Josepha Williams, also purchased land around the Evergreen area and received the former Stewart Hotel through her mother's will. She donated land and buildings for the creation of the center. For recuperative reasons, Canon Charles Winfred Douglas, who was married to Josepha Williams, came to Evergreen for its summer retreats and music camps beginning in 1897.

The competition takes place at two levels: city and national. Each competition is in question and answer format and conducted in English. The winner of the national German Neuroscience Olympiad will represent Germany at the International Brain Bee competition. History The \\"Deutsche Neurowissenschaften-Olympiad\\" is part of the International Brain Bee program which oversees more than 150 competitions in over 45 countries each year. The program was founded in 1999 by Dr. Norbert Myslinski in the United States. The program has since expanded beyond the United States. Dr. Julianne McCall established the \\"German Brain Bee\\" competition in 2011, the first of its kind in Germany. The German Brain Bee takes place in Heidelberg and includes over 100 high schools across Germany. In 2015, \\"The German Brain Bee\\" was renamed the Deutsche Neurowissenschaften-Olympiad and is organized by the Deutsche Neurowissenschaften-Olympiad Association. In 2016, the board of the DNO began the process of expanding the competition throughout Germany. Mission The motto of DNO is \\"Driving Connectivity\\", the organization's mission is to motivate and inspire young people to learn about the human brain, foster interest in the various fields of neurosciences and pursuit of careers in basic neuroscience research. Through local and national competitions, summer research schools, practical courses, and other outreach programs DNO would like to encourage national and international exchange among students on their way towards a scientific career. The philosophy of DNO is that through encouraging young students to work together to face new and exciting challenges in neuroscience research, there can be a further understanding of brain functions. Competition The competition, which until 2016 has only taken place in Heidelberg, is open to students in grades 9 to 13 with the total number of participants limited to 60 students per city. Currently, the German Neuroscience Olympiad is expanding into other cities throughout Germany. In addition to Heidelberg, since 2017, there has been local student competitions in Berlin, Bonn, and Frankfurt. Therefore, 180 students are anticipated to participate in the local Neuroscience Olympiads in 2020. The top 15 students from each local competition will be invited to the finals, the location of which is rotated each year. The DNO provides travel allowances for a student traveling long distances to participate in each consecutive level of the Olympiad. The competition is divided into 4 parts: podium section, where a jury of three professors will ask questions; a short written exam section; a neuroanatomy section with plastic brain models in addition to microscopy slides with real human brain samples; and a patient diagnosis section with patient videos and mock medical history data. The competition is held in English but a jury can assist in German, if necessary.  Awards  The winner of the German Neuroscience Olympiad finals competition receives a trophy and the opportunity to represent Germany at the International Brain Bee, for which flights and accommodation are paid for each winner and a chaperone. The 2nd and 3rd-place winners are also awarded smaller prizes. In the future, DNO aims to provide the top 3 students of each local German Neuroscience Olympiad competition with a chance to do a summer internship in a neuroscience research lab, to allow students to see what the day-to-day research is like.

She was also a freelance (or 'paid agent') speaker in the campaigns for Irish Home Rule and the cooperative movement and against vivisection, compulsory vaccination, and the Contagious Diseases Acts.Reynolds's Newspaper, 23 October 1881,p1; Lincolnshire Chronicle, 7 April 1871, p.4; N.

Blackburn, Women's Suffrage: A Record of the Women's Suffrage Movement in the British Isles, with Biographical Sketches of Miss Becker (1902), p.127 As a child she appeared on the stage and this may have given her the skills and the confidence for paid public speaking. She began in the late 1850s giving readings from plays and recitations, before moving onto delivering orations at temperance meetings, and was described on one such occasion in 1861 as a 'clever Quakeress'.For example Clerkenwell News, 8 November 1856, p.1 and West Middlesex Advertiser and Family Journal, 1 May 1858, p.3;At the Corn Exchange Hall, Dundee in the Dundee, Perth and Cupar Advertiser, 7 June 1861, p.5. By December 1868, she was addressing suffrage meetings.Dundee Courier, 25 December 1868, p.3, although E..Crawford, The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1866-1928 (2003), p.149 suggests July 1870. A newspaper reporter wrote in 1869 at Alnwick that her talks were well attended, but added that this was because a lady lecturer was a novelty, recalling Dr Johnson's comments on the subject, ‚Äò‚Ä¶a woman's preaching is like a dog's walking on his hind legs. It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all.‚ÄôAlnwick Mercury, 25 December 1869, p.4, quoting from J. Boswell, The life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D (1827), p.128 As a suffragist She is recorded as speaking on behalf of women's rights between 1868 and 1884. Her main supporters were the radical suffragists Priscilla Bright McLaren, Lilias Ashworth Hallett and the Quaker sisters Anna Maria and Mary Priestman, who had realised the necessity of gaining support from the working classes for the suffrage movement.E..Crawford, The Women's Suffrage Movement..., p.150;Yorkshire Gazette, 3 June 1884, p.5 The feminist and campaigner for women's rights, Helen Blackburn called her ‚Äòthat strange erratic genius‚Äô who spoke with a tone like a 'mighty melodious bell'. Miss Blackburn noted that she planned and carried out her tours by herself, travelling all over the kingdom from John O'Groats to Lands End, accompanied only by her little dog, and that, with the power of her magnificent voice, she was able to gather audiences and hold them riveted, ‚Äòfrom miners in Northumberland‚Ä¶ and fishers in Cornwall... to agricultural labourers in the market-places of country towns‚Äô.H. Blackburn, Women's suffrage... (1902), pp.153,126 Craigen also visited Stornoway in the Scottish Hebrides, the writer and politician Henry Hyndman wrote vividly of her: > Jessie Craigen was ugly, self-taught, roughly attired, and uncouth in her > ways.Yet all this was soon overlooked when once the lady began to > speak...She came forward, dumped down on the table in front of me an > umbrella, a neck wrapper, and a shabby old bag.Then she turned round to face > the audience. She was greeted with boisterous peals of laughter. No wonder! > Such a figure of fun you never saw. It was Mrs. Gamp come again in the flesh > ‚Äì umbrella, corkscrew curls and all.

Hyndman, Further Reminiscences (1912), p.8 By 1879 she was appearing on platforms with the principal figures of the suffrage movement and at Manchester, in October of that year, Helen Blackburn said that she 'held the meeting enchained by her grand voice and her strong and witty words, delivered with practised power'.H. Blackburn, Women's suffrage... (1902), p.148 On 3 February 1880 she spoke at the ‚ÄòGreat Demonstration of Women‚Äô in the Free Trade Hall, alongside such luminaries as Mrs McClaren, Lydia Becker and Josephine Butler.Manchester Times , 7 February 1880, p.6 In 1881-2 she seems to have formed a romantic friendship with the feminist and suffragist Helen Taylor, a woman from a very different social background. This was always going to be problematic, since class differences in late-Victorian England meant that women like Craigen, who took payment for their suffrage work, were likely to be regarded on the same terms as personal servants by the middle-class leadership of the movement. However, this friendship actually faded, to Craigen's great regret, over differences of opinion concerning Ireland and Charles Stewart Parnell, who was often a houseguest of Miss Taylor.S.S. Holton, Suffrage Days: Stories from the Women's Suffrage Movement (2002), pp.59-60 As the suffrage movement split, after its failure to win any measure for women's right to vote under the Third Reform Act of December 1884, Jesse Craigen's position, as a paid agent speaker, became more difficult and she gradually faded from the women's rights scene. She continued to protest on behalf of other causes however, contributing an article to the Nineteenth Century Review against proposals to build a Channel Tunnel, and when speaking at an anti-vivisection, anti-vaccination demonstration in Chelsea, in April 1894, she was described as ‚Äòa stout, elderly lady of dark complexion, with a stubby beard and a strong moustache‚Ä¶‚Äô Pall Mall Gazette, 4 May 1882, p.4; D. Clifford, E. Wadge, et al., Repositioning Victorian Sciences: Shifting Centres in Nineteenth-century Scientific Thinking (2006), p.216 Later life and death The Local Government Act 1894 had created a system of urban and rural district councils, and had permitted women to be councillors. In December 1894, Jessie Craigen stood, as the only woman candidate, in the election for Ilford Urban District Council, on behalf of the Women's Liberal Association. She was unsuccessful, coming fourteenth out of seventeen candidates.

Biography Following formal studies for an MFA degree in studio and art theory with Charles Gaines, Walla curated several exhibitions in California from 1973 to 1976, including Masterworks of Modern Sculpture (from the collections of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the late Ben Deane of Southern California), 200 Years of American Painting, and the first traveling survey of large scale paintings by Alex Katz. Before leaving the West Coast he would also have several regional museum shows of his own fine art in California. In 1976, Walla relocated to New York City where he would become the Vice- President of Marlborough Gallery and coordinated the exhibitions and activities for Francis Bacon, Larry Rivers, Alex Katz, Red Grooms, and the Estates of Jacques Lipchitz and Barbara Hepworth. In 1985, Mr. Walla opened a new gallery on the corner of Madison & 57th Street named Kent Fine Art. Along with organizing and curating over two hundred exhibitions, he has produced and published over fifty books on modern and contemporary art. Projects have included Dennis Adams: The Architecture of Amnesia, Herbert Bayer: Bauhaus and Beyond, Eugene Carriere: The Symbol of Creation, John Heartfield: AIZ/VI 1930‚Äì1938, Francis Picabia: Accommodations of Desire, Medardo Rosso: Impressions in Wax and Bronze, Dorothea Tanning: Insomnias, and more. The gallery would represent the surrealists Dorothea Tanning and Meret Oppenheim, The Estate of Herbert Bayer (Bauhaus), conceptual artists of conscience including Dennis Adams, Chris Burden, Llyn Foulkes, Antoni Muntadas, Irving Petlin, Judith Shea and many others. Outreach activities have included the Venice Biennale project by Emily Prince entitled \\"American Servicemen and Women Who Have Died in Iraq and Afghanistan (but Not Including the Wounded, nor the Iraqis nor the Afghans),\\" which documented over 3900 casualties in drawing form, which favorably reviewed by the International Herald Tribune, The New York Times, and New York Magazine along with European journals. Walla also organized exhibition support for the recent retrospectives for Antoni Muntadas, Llyn Foulkes, and Paul Laffoley. His most recent writing and archival project is The Essential Paul Laffoley published by the University of Chicago Press documenting paintings and journals executed over the previous four decades. The publication is the culmination of 27 years of archiving the original texts and works of art of Paul Laffoley, an important visionary artist. He also oversaw the development of a website dedicated to the 125 discovered handwritten journals of Paul Laffoley. In 2017, the activities of Kent Fine Art were summarized in the redesign and comprehensive website containing the archives of over 200 curatorial projects, 50 publications and numerous research projects. Given a 30 year back catalogue of exhibitions, it was also a convenient method to access the gallery history. Particular focus was given to Surrealism, Symbolism and Dada, and to contemporary artists of conscience, and institutional critique as well as conceptual rigor. Presently he serves as Executor of the Estate of Paul Laffoley, and is compiling research on the oeuvre of Irving Petlin, and developing a forthcoming monograph documenting 40 years of street architecture, interventions, and video installations of Dennis Adams. http://www.kentfineart.net/ http://paullaffoley.net/ http://llynfoulkes.com/ http://www.talkinnewyork.com/douglas-walla-appears-at-molly-barnes-salon/ http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/author/W/D/au22656891.html http://dangerousminds.net/tag/Douglas-Walla http://artnet.tumblr.com/post/115853280468/artnet-asks-douglas-walla-of-new- yorks-kent-fine References Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:American art collectors ","title":"Douglas Walla"},{"id":"51886440","text":"Oakwood is an unincorporated community in Otsego Township, Steuben County, in the U.S. state of Indiana.

At the time of construction the land was owned by the Bishop of Killaloe. Construction was overseen by the Justiciar, Henry of London, and formed part of John's efforts to solidify his conquest of Ireland, particularly the midlands and southern counties.H. G. Leask.

In 1646, the castle and town were stormed by Owen Roe O'Neill during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. The castle fell to Cromwell in 1650 and was used for a short period by Cromwell's son-in-law Henry Ireton. In 1703, the Castle was sold to the Royal Hospital Kilmainham by the Duke of Ormonde. It was purchased by local merchant John Damer in 1722 and later passed down to the Earl of Portarlington. It was used as a barracks from 1798, housing 350 soldiers, and later served as a school, library, and tuberculosis sanatorium. The Castle fell into disrepair in the 19th century, with a roof collapse which necessitated extensive repairs in the 1850s. It was named a national monument in 1892 and is registered as National Monument number 211.Cunningham, George. Roscrea and District: Illustrated Guide, Monuments and Antiquities.

The castle was originally surrounded by a river to the east and a moat on the other sides. While it does not have a keep, the main residence is a three-storey rectangular gate building to the north, complemented by two three-quarter round towers, one to the southwest and one to the southeast. The south-western tower, known as the Ormond Tower, contains a first floor room with a fireplace on the north wall and a 17th-century plasterwork coat of arms. The south-eastern tower, referred to as King John's Castle, is taller, with 3 storeys. The original gate building is dated to around 1280 but the current stone structure was built by the 4th Earl of Ormond in the 15th century. The gate building is approximately 27 metres high and originally included a bascule bridge and portcullis. The entrance has a barrel vault ceiling. Below the gate tower is a basement prison which was accessible by trapdoor. In the 17th century, a second floor living area was added to the building including a pointed groined vault, three bays, lancet windows, a garderobe, a chimney stack, a large hooded dog-tooth capital fireplace on the southern wall, and crow-stepped gables. The drawbridge was operated from this floor. A spiral staircase in the eastern corner of the building gives access to the upper floors. The slate roof dates from the 18th century. The building was further renovated in the 19th century. The courtyard includes buildings from the 18th century and some modern structures. The southern castle wall is no longer intact.Gleeson, Hist.

Architectural History, Vol. 41 (1998), pp. 67-81. Damer House In 1728, John Damer built a large Georgian house on the grounds of the Castle. Designed in Queen Anne style, the three-storey-over-basement house features 9 bay windows and one of only 2 Queen Anne style staircases in Ireland. Although recognised as one of the few examples of pre-Palladian architecture in Ireland, Damer House was due to be demolished in the 1960s, with suggestions that it be replaced by a swimming pool or a bacon factory. It was eventually saved after a campaign by Desmond Guinness and the Irish Georgian Society, which took out a lease on the House in 1973. The House was restored initially by the Irish Georgian Society from 1980 to 1983 and opened to the public. The lease was then transferred to the Roscrea Heritage Society.

She is the owner of the Epicurean Connection, in Sonoma, California, and is the creator of Delice de la Vallee cheese, along with other fresh cheeses. Early life and education Davis was born in Sonoma, California in 1969. She learned how to cook from her grandfather, who served a meal to farmers and ranchers at the Sonoma Grange every Friday. When she was a teenager, she served as an apprentice under M.F.K. Fisher, and also worked for Ig Vella. Davis credits Vella as her mentor and for teaching her about entrepreneurship and food communities. He mentored her until his death in 2011. In 1988, she earned a degree in Culinary Arts from Santa Rosa Junior College. That same year, she found a copy of the Commander's Palace Cookbook at a bookstore. The book launched a lifelong interest in New Orleans cuisine and culture. She proceeded to intern at Commander's Palace in New Orleans, Louisiana. Lolis Eric Elie describes Davis as an \\"expert\\" in New Orleans food. After returning to Sonoma, she began catering. Her daughter Karina was born in 1992. That same year she started the Epicurean Connection. After buying a house in Sonoma, she met winemaker Bob Sessions. Sessions introduced Davis to his son, Ben, whom she would marry in 2016. Culinary career After Hurricane Katrina, Davis visited New Orleans 14 times to help with rebuilding efforts, including feeding relief workers. Davis also promoted an event with chef Susan Spicer, in Sonoma, to raise funds for victims of the hurricane. Davis was featured in an advertising campaign for VerticalResponse in 2015. In 2016, Davis won an \\"Ultimate Fan\\" contest for her tailgating recipe using Nathan's Famous hot dogs at the 2016 Toyota/Save Mart 350. In 2016, Davis was named the curator of the Last House, the final home of M.F.K. Fisher, located in Glen Ellen, California. Davis served as a cheese educator in Dubai on behalf of the US Dairy Export Council and the US Cheese Guild. As part of her work in Dubai, Davis participated in the Dubai Cheese Fest alongside fellow cheese expert Mark Todd. =Epicurean Connection= The Epicurean Connection is a catering, cheese production, and cheese education company started by Davis in 1992. The business originally started as a marketing firm, which included Straus Family Creamery and Cowgirl Creamery clients. A \\"cheese cake\\" made by the Epicurean Connection In 2005, Davis opened the Epicurean Connection in Boyes Hot Springs. It was originally going to serve as an office space for her marketing firm. Davis discovered her grandfather, who taught her to cook, had a business in the same space 40 years prior. Renovations to the space led to Davis finding that the space was originally built as a commercial kitchen. Thus leading Davis to open a small cafe. By 2011, the small shop had outgrown its space and Davis relocated the shop to downtown Sonoma. The \\"new\\" Epicurean was a combination cheese shop, cafe serving lunch and dinner, and beer and wine bar. Food options included Tasso ham sandwiches, pulled pork sandwiches, soups, and cheese plates. The space also hosted regular concerts and potlucks, including a monthly Farmer Dinner, in which local farmers brought food to share and networked over dinner. Sunset named the Epicurean Cafe one of the top 50 local food shops in California. Davis closed the cafe, selling the cafe to chef Manuel Avezedo, in September 2015, to focus cheese production, catering and cheese education. Today, under the Epicurean Connection, Davis teaches cheesemaking and cheese education classes to the general public and the restaurant industry. Classes are taught at various locations, including the Silverado Resort. Participants learn how to make ricotta cheese, resulting in a 2-3 pound finished cheese. =Cheesemaking= Davis serving Delice de la Vallee at an event in 2015 Davis produces multiple fresh cheeses, all which use local Northern California milks. She began experimenting with various cheeses left over from catering. She made fromage blanc, chevre and cr√®me fra√Æche. Eventually, Davis created her first signature cheese, Delice de la Vallee. Delice de la Vallee is a triple-cream cheese made from goat milk, cow milk cream and whole cow milk. It has been described as \\"creamy, fluffy, earthy and tangy.\\" It was awarded a first place prize at the 2010 American Cheese Conference and Competition for the best \\"Fresh Unripened Mixed Milk\\" cheese. Delice was named one of the top cheeses for cheeseburgers by Saveur. Jay-Z and Beyonc√© are fans of the cheese. A second cheese, Creme de Fromage, was introduced in 2010. It is a triple cream cow's milk cheese. It is sweeter and thicker than Delice de la Vallee. Davis' cheese production takes place at a cooperative in Berkeley, California. She produces 500 pounds of cheese weekly. Her cheese is served at the French Laundry and Kendall-Jackson. Davis was featured on Reinventing the Meal with Richard Blais in 2012 for her cheesemaking. She also founded the Sonoma Valley Cheese Conference and Winter Artisan Cheese Fair. In 2019, she was featured in Huffington Post for her mac and cheese, which uses five speciality cheeses.

It includes the plant itself, the environment and all micro- and macro-organisms living in, on, or around the plant. These organisms include bacteria, archaea, fungi, protists, insects, animals and other plants. The environment includes the soil, air and climate. Examples of ecological areas are fields, rangelands, forests. Knowledge of the interactions within a phytobiome can be used to create tools for agriculture, crop management, increased health, preservation, productivity, and sustainability of cropping and forest systems.  Signaling  Environments within the Phytobiome  Diversity  The microbial community within the phytobiome is perhaps one of the most rich and diverse microbiomes on Earth. Plants form associations with billions of organisms across every kingdom of life. Recent metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches have allowed scientists to discover novel taxonomic species that are not easily cultured in a laboratory. = Bacteria = Recent research has shown that inter-kingdom communication between organisms is essential for proper phytobiome function. There are numerous physical and chemical signals such as secreted lipids, peptides and polysaccharides that allow organisms to recognize and interact within the phytobiome. Bacteria are known to produce quorum sensing molecules such as homoserine lactones (HSLs), lipid-like diffusable factors and signaling peptides that mediate plant-bacteria interactions such as colonization. HSLs have been are reportedly produced by a large number of bacteria found in the rhizosphere. Plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPBs) often produce Nod factors (nodulation factors) that initiate nodule formation in plants. In addition to plant-bacterial interactions, bacteria often secrete bactericidal or fungicidal compounds into the phytobiome to reduce local competition for niches and resources. Additionally, organisms that feed on bacteria such as some species of algae and protists are attracted to these small signaling molecules. = Phages = Bacteriophages also play a critical role in the phytobiome through predator-prey interactions. Bacteriophages use a signaling peptides such as arbitrium to mediate the initiation of cell lysis and lysogeny in the host cell. = Fungi = Fungi communicate in the phytobiome through chemical signaling to aid in sexual reproduction, sporulation, cell- to-cell recognition and antibiosis; however, only a fraction of these chemicals have been studied for their function. Mycorrhizal fungi establish symbiotic relationships with plants through the production of Myc factors, or chitooligosaccharides that are recognized by receptors in the plant. Nematode- trapping fungi often utilize fungal signaling molecules to initiate morphogensis towards prey. Other organisms can interfere with fungal signaling, such as plant-produced oxylipins that mimic fungal signaling molecules and can regulate fungal development or reduce virulence. Multiple spceis of bacteria, insects and nematodes have all been reported to respond to fungal signaling compounds. = Nematodes = Very little is known about nematode communication within the phytobiome. Plant-pathogenic nematodes often communicate through production of pheromones. Plants can detect these compounds and induce defense pathways. Nematodes also produce plant hormones such as cytokinins that aid in the establishment of association with plants. = Protists = Perhaps even less is known about the ecological role of protists and viruses within the phytobiome. Some amoebae species use cyclic nucleotides or peptide signals to adapt social behavior. Phytohormones produced by algae-associated bacteria can greatly impact microalgae populations in the soil. The presence of amoeba can also trigger the bacterium P. fluorescens to produce anti-amoebal toxins. = Insects = Insects communicate to transfer information regarding external threats, social status, food availability and mating through the production of volatile pheromones, also known as semiochemicals. This has made pheromones a subject of research since the 1950s for various applications in agriculture and insect-vectored diseases such as malaria. Plants can have profound impacts on insect pheromone production. Rattlebox plants produce various alkaloid compounds that insects use as a precursor for sex pheromone synthesis. Many plant species have evolved production of volatile chemicals that interfere with pheromone signaling, often through inhibition of proper olfactory neuron function. Bacteria and fungi can also produce volatile chemicals that affect insect behavior. = Plants = The presence of plants and their communication with other community members fundamentally shapes the phytobiome. Root exudates contain numerous sugars, amino acids, polysaccharides and secondary metabolites. The production of these exudates is heavily influenced by environmental factors and plant physiology and can alter the community composition of the rhizosphere and rhizoplain.The secretion of flavonoids helps to recruit Rhizobia bacteria that form a mutualistic symbiosis with numerous plant species. Rhizobia can also recognize other plant compounds such as betaines, aldonic acids and jasmonic acid. These signal molecules can have multiple or even counteracting effects. For example, plant cutins trigger arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization and symbiosis but can also be recognized by plant-pathogenic oomycetes and trigger pathogenesis. Plant volatile chemicals also attract herbivores, pollinators and seed carriers. When plants recognize the presence of microbes, they often activate the production of phytohormone signals that are transported throughout the plant. Plants respond to pathogens and herbivores through production of hormones including salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene. In addition, many phytohormones that function in abiotic stress tolerance or plant growth also trigger responses with the microbial community. The production of salicylic acid in Arabidopsis was shown to influence the root microbiome composition by acting as a signal or carbon source. Secretion of strigolactone is known to stimulate spore germination and Myc factor production in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The microbial community can also manipulate phytohormone function or the production of specific phytohormones in plants.  Research  In 2015 the American Phytopathological Society (APS) launched a research framework, the Phytobiomes Initiative, to facilitate the organization of research into phytobiome. As part of this effort, in 2016 it launched Phytobiomes Journal, an open-access journal. The journal focuses on transdisciplinary research that impacts the entire plant ecosystem. An overall research strategy has been published in the Phytobiomes Roadmap, a document developed by a group of scientific societies, companies, research institutes, and governmental agencies. It is intended to present a strategic plan to study phytobiomes and propose an action plan to apply phytobiome studies. The connected Phytobiomes Alliance is an international, nonprofit consortium of academic institutions, large and small companies, and governmental agencies coordinating public- private research projects on various aspects of agriculturally relevant phytobiomes.

In Memory Yet Green (1979) and In Joy Still Felt (1980) were a two-volume work, covering his life up to 1978. The third volume, I Asimov: A Memoir (1994), published after his death, was not a sequel but a new work which covered his whole life. This third book won a Hugo Award. Before writing these books, Asimov also published three anthologies of science fiction stories which contained autobiographical accounts of his life in the introductions to the stories: The Early Asimov (1972), Before the Golden Age (1974), and Buy Jupiter and Other Stories (1975). Books The Early Asimov, or, Eleven Years of Trying (Doubleday, 1972) is a collection of almost all of the published short stories Asimov wrote during the first eleven years of his career, 1938 to 1949, other than his robots and Foundation series of stories (and his first story, \\"Marooned off Vesta\\"), which had already been collected in other books. Each story is prefaced by an introduction about how the story came to be written and published. The book also refers to eleven unpublished stories which, at the time the book was written, Asimov thought had since been lost, as he no longer had the manuscripts. Collectively, this material describes the beginning of Asimov's career and his long association with John W. Campbell, the editor of Astounding Science-Fiction, who published many of the stories in the book and to whom the book is dedicated. The book covers the first 60 stories Asimov wrote, and ends with the publication of his first novel in 1950. Before the Golden Age: A Science Fiction Anthology of the 1930s (Doubleday, 1974) is a collection of science fiction short stories by a variety of authors, which were all originally published in pulp magazines in the 1930s. It also includes one of Asimov's eleven lost stories, \\"Big Game\\" (written in 1941), which a fan had discovered in a collection of Asimov's papers in Boston University library after reading about it in The Early Asimov. Edited by Asimov, this book contains autobiographical material describing his childhood as a science fiction fan who grew up reading 1930s magazines. It ends at the point when Asimov sold his first published story in 1938, where The Early Asimov began, and thus is a prequel to that book. Buy Jupiter and Other Stories (Doubleday, 1975) collects 24 of Asimov's stories, first published between 1950 and 1973. The autobiographical material between the stories covers the same period, carrying on from where The Early Asimov left off and ending at his marriage to his second wife, Janet Jeppson Asimov. In the introduction Asimov explains that he hopes that by including autobiographical information in his story collections, it will be easier to resist editorial pressure to write a proper autobiography. In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920‚Äì1954 (Doubleday, 1979) is the first volume of Asimov's two-volume autobiography. It ends shortly before the point when he became a full-time writer. Up until then, his main career had been lecturing in biochemistry at Boston University School of Medicine, although by then he already earned more from his writing than he did from his academic post.I. Asimov: A Memoir (1994), pp. 196, 200 It is Asimov's joint-200th book; it was published on the same day as Opus 200. It includes another of Asimov's lost stories, \\"The Weapon\\" (written in 1938), which he had forgotten had been published under a pseudonym. In an interview shortly after publication, Asimov said: \\"I've done nothing in my life. You would be surprised how shrewdly I had to write it to obscure that fact.\\"\\"An Interview with Isaac Asimov\\" by Phil Konstantin at americanindian.net (retrieved 20 April 2019). He later wrote: > A reader once told me, enthusiastically, after the autobiography was > published, that he had read the book with immense interest and that he had > been unable to keep from turning the pages and reading on and on and on, > laughing all the way. I said to him, curiously, \\"Didn't you notice that > nothing was happening?\\" \\"I noticed that,\\" he said, \\"but I didn't care.\\"I. > Asimov: A Memoir (1994), p. 437 The publishers disliked Asimov's original title, As I Remember, so they asked him to provide another, suggesting he find a good quote from an obscure poem.I. Asimov: A Memoir (1994), p. 438 Asimov suggested the following poem: > In memory yet green, in joy still felt, The scenes of life rise sharply into > view. We triumph; Life's disasters are undealt, And while all else is old, > the world is new. Doubleday agreed to Asimov's new title, but could not find the source of the verse he had given them. When Doubleday inquired, Asimov confessed: \\"I wrote it myself\\". The poem was included at the front of the book, attributed to \\"Anon.\\" In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954‚Äì1978 (1980) is the second part of Asimov's autobiography. The title is also taken from the poem. The two volumes are 640,000 words long in total. In Joy Still Felt won the 1981 Locus Award for best science fiction-related nonfiction book.sfadb.com Asimov had intended to write the third volume in 2000, starting where the second had left off,I. Asimov: A Memoir (1994), p. xi and to call it The Scenes of Life. But after falling ill in 1990 he decided to write it early, on his wife Janet's advice, in case he did not live that long. Janet's opinion was that the original two-volume autobiography was too chronological (although it was highly detailed, owing to Asimov's eidetic memory and the copious notes he kept about his life in his daily diary), lending it an emotionless and reserved quality. As such, she encouraged him to write a third volume which would instead convey more of his feelings about the contents. Published posthumously under the title I. Asimov: A Memoir (Doubleday, 1994; 235,000 wordsI. Asimov: A Memoir (1994), p. 560), it covered his whole life, so that people who had not read the first two volumes could still enjoy it.I.

The fight went 15 rounds, with Ali winning through a unanimous decision. Background During a pre-fight interview in ABC studios, a physical altercation ensued between the two. Terrell offhandedly called Ali by his birth name of Cassius Clay multiple times in a statement not directed at him. Ali took immediate offense and interrupted Terrell, asking why he called him that; Terrell noted that Ali had introduced himself by that name when they first met. Ali quickly escalated the situation, saying \\"my name is Muhammad Ali\\" and threatening to \\"make [Terrell] announce it in the center of that ring if [he] don't do it now.\\" He then called him \\"an old Uncle Tom, another Floyd Patterson\\", and further threatened \\"I'm gonna punish you.\\" Terrell took offense in turn, saying \\"you ain't got no business callin' me an Uncle Tom. Don't call me no Uncle Tom, man.\\" Ali yelled back \\"That's what you are, an Uncle Tom!\\", to which Terrell responded \\"Why you gonna call me an Uncle Tom, I ain't do nothin' to you.\\" Ali simply yelled \\"Uncle Tom!\\" repeatedly and slapped Terrell, resulting in a shoving match between the two.Muhammad Ali Angry Slaps Terrell For Calling Him Clay. The fight Ali was ahead in most of the rounds. In the first two rounds, Terrell was competitive, but in the third Terrell's eye started to swell, leaving him half-blind for much of the match. By the sixth round Ali was clearly ahead, though Terrell still had moments. The shift came in the seventh round, when Ali landed a left hook that sent Terrell to the ropes, and launched a flurry of blows seeking a knockout. Terrell repelled Ali with his own desperate offensive, but had wobbly legs for the remainder of the match. Terrell landed a hard right hook that forced Ali back to the ropes in turn, causing the announcer to say \\"Clay is hurt, Terrell is desperately fighting back.\\" The eighth round went solidly to Ali, battering the wobbly and half-blinded Terrell, though Terrell still landed jabs and would jolt Ali with a hook. This state went on for the rest of the fight; in the 13th round, commentator and boxer George Chuvalo commented that Terrell had been unexpectedly hanging on and that Ali looked tired, predicting the fight would end with a decision rather than a knockout, which turned out to be a correct assessment.\\"Ali vs Terrell.\\" Boxing News. August 2018. In the eighth round, Ali taunted Terrell by asking \\"What's my name?\\" and calling him \\"Tom\\", but ceased to speak to him after that point, not even saying a word to him when the match ended and both boxers went back to their respective corners.. Two of the Judges scored the bout 148‚Äì137 and the other had it 148‚Äì133 all in favor of Ali. Aftermath This performance was seen as vicious and made Ali unpopular with some boxing fans, due to accusations that Ali was intentionally dragging out the bout to further hurt Terrell when he could have instead gone for a knockout. Ali himself denied this, and stated he simply was not capable of knocking Terrell out despite throwing hundreds of shots at his head. He said: \\"I don't believe I could have. I had a couple of opportunities to knock him out, but he was so determined. I didn't realize he could take as much punishment as he did. After the eighth round I laid it on him but I found myself tiring. I had 15 rounds to go and started pacing myself.\\" After the match, he continued to insult Terrell, saying \\"Ernie Terrell has no class whatsoever... It's a joke calling him a champion.\\" Nat Fleischer in the Ring Magazine was critical of Ali's inability to gain a stoppage, unfavorably comparing him to Rocky Marciano and Joe Louis, who he insisted would have had no problem knocking Terrell out.\\"Ali vs Terrell.\\" Boxing News.

The project is currently under consideration by the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership as a means to address \\"poor connectivity between North Somerset, Bristol Airport and Bristol\\". History In November 2006 the airport's Master Plan stated that \\"the provision of a direct rail service is not a realistic prospect\\". The first mention of a potential airport rail link was in November 2015 in the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership's Joint Transport Study Key Principles Report as a future transport concept. Then in July 2016 the airport's chief executive officer Robert Sinclair discussed the possibility of a light rail link to the airport. The West of England LEP subsequently announced their application to the Department for Transport‚Äôs Large Local Major Transport Schemes fund for the \\"South West Bristol Economic Link\\" ‚Äì a strategy designed to address \\"poor connectivity between North Somerset, Bristol Airport and Bristol\\". It was also reported in the Bristol Evening Post in September 2016 that North Somerset Council had applied to the government for \\"nearly ¬£2 million in funding to draw up proposals to improve links on the A38 between the city and the expanding Bristol Airport\\", which included new road options as well as a light or heavy rail line. In October 2016 the local authorities proposed ¬£7.5 billion in public transport investments for the West of England, including the airport rail link. In early 2017 a light rail link to the airport was listed as an election promise in the upcoming West of England mayoral election, 2017 by Liberal Democrat candidate Stephen Williams and independent candidate Dr John Savage. By late 2017 an updated airport Master Plan will be completed, with a railway line part of the options being considered to cater to increasing airport passenger numbers. The Mayor has proposed an underground line which would link Bristol Temple Meads with Bristol Airport and has commitioned a study into the proposals. Route The West of England LEP‚Äôs Option Development Report, published in 2016, outlined various possible routes for the new railway line: *A direct link to the airport from Bristol Temple Meads railway station, branching from the Bristol to Exeter line from Long Ashton, was considered to be a \\"fully segregated high quality link to the airport, which should provide short journey times\\" with \\"good connections with wider rail network at Bristol Temple Meads\\" despite a significant altitude gain between the railway line and the airport ‚Äì of around ‚Äì for which a light rail option was seen to be more flexible. *A link via Yatton is being considered due to the possibility of using the old trackbed of the Strawberry Line and the Wrington Vale Light Railway, which is mostly still undeveloped. Again, a gain in altitude is considered to be a potential hindrance to this idea. *Conversion of the upcoming Ashton Vale to Temple Meads and South Bristol Link MetroBus routes to light rail, then following the A38 to the airport is described as reaching more of Bristol city centre than other options, while being less time efficient. In December 2016 the director of Taylor Wimpey stated that the light rail option along the A38 was also being looked at to serve the proposed development known as The Vale. In October 2017, the West of England Joint Transport Study - Executive Summary described the scheme as a \\"fully segregated mass transit route connecting Bristol Airport and South Bristol to city centre, with options to be considered for underground running. Route to be determined balancing maximising patronage against engineering costs (options comprise via Ashton Vale, via Hartcliffe Way, via Parson Street/Bedminster, or a segregated route via South Bristol).\\" See also *Light rail in Bristol *Proposed transport developments in Bristol *Airport rail link References Category:Proposed railway lines in England Category:Rail transport in Bristol Category:Airport rail links in the United Kingdom Category:Transport in Somerset ","title":"Bristol Airport Rail Link"},{"id":"51886658","text":"Duane Straugheir (born 28 September 1989), also known by the nickname of \\"Straff\\", is an English rugby league footballer who plays for Hunslet in Betfred League 1.

Life and career Becker was born in Locke, New York in 1829. He attended Case Western Reserve University and the University of Michigan Law School before relocating to St. Paul, Minnesota in 1849 to practice law. He formed a partnership with Edmund Rice and Ellis Whitall which lasted until 1856. He first entered politics in 1854 when he was elected as a city council member for St. Paul. In 1856 he was elected mayor of St. Paul and served for a single one year term. He participated in the Democratic Minnesota Constitutional Convention in 1857 and was elected as one of three people to serve in the United States House of Representatives for the newly organized state. When it was revealed that the state would only receive two seats, Becker was the one left out. By some accounts he withdrew from consideration while others suggest the three candidates drew straws and Becker was the one who lost. Becker went on to serve in the administration of Governor Henry Hastings Sibley as well as two terms in the Minnesota State Senate from 1868 to 1872. He unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Minnesota twice (in 1859 and 1894) and for a seat in the US House of Representatives (in 1872). Outside of politics he spent much of his later life working in the railroad industry including positions with the Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad and the Western Railroad of Minnesota.

Meeks stars as a notorious Texas criminal whose gang is slowly picked off one-by-one by an unknown killer. It premiered at the ninth Dallas International Film Festival and was released in the US on March 1, 2016.  Plot  In 1900 Texas, Claude \\"Sweet Tooth\\" Barbee, Frank \\"Blockey\\" Jackson, and Tom Nixon ambush a chain gang to free their fellow gang member, \\"Slap\\" Jack Davis. Davis knows where the gold from their last robbery is, but the others are dismayed when it turns out to be 500 miles away. Nixon, their leader, balks at the journey, but the others threaten to go without him. On the way, they meet a traveling salesman and his ward, a teenager who operates a ventriloquist's dummy. Amused by the puppet, the men pause to listen to their pitch, only to become enraged when the salesman beats the boy. After killing the salesman, Barbee accepts the boy, Willie, into their gang. They are joined shortly by Goody Spotswood, their scout. As they pass through a town, the gang kills several people while robbing a local church, and Davis is wounded. Meanwhile, Rudy Goebel murders his employer. When his wife protests, he kills her, too. As he dumps his wife's body in the cellar, he calls down to his children, chastising them for an unspecified transgression. After Goebel locks his children in with their mother's corpse, the Nixon gang barges into the house, seeking aid. All but Barbee eat Goebel's drugged soup. As Goebel tortures Davis, Barbee wakes and kills Goebel. The gang leaves the house in the morning. The next time they camp, they wake to find Nixon dead. After they accuse each other of his murder, Barbee settles the matter by saying Nixon was old and probably died of natural causes. Barbee becomes the de faco leader, and his gang robs several towns on their way to the gold. Sheriff Everheart and Deputy Peak chase after him, encouraged by the reward and the thought of being hailed as heroes. The Barbee gang takes refuge at the Wilberforce homestead, where Jackson rapes and murders the Wilberforces' daughter. Barbee reluctantly kills her vengeful father but stops the gang from killing the other family members. Although spooked that one of their horses has been brutally slaughtered, they steal a horse from the Wilberforce barn and flee. After they rob a whorehouse, ex-prostitute Pearl follows after them, asking to join. As she and Barbee become closer, he tells her about the gold. She and Barbee have sex at a hotel where Everheart and Peak are staying, and Barbee leaves a taunting note for them. When Barbee wakes, Pearl and the map to the gold are gone, and Willie is dead. The others blame Pearl for Willie's murder, but Barbee reasons Pearl is no murderer; instead, he suggests a crazed native American is responsible. Spotswood dies next, and Barbee is haunted by nightmares of a bestial man who hunts his gang. While Davis seeks aid from a doctor, Pearl tips off Everheart. Barbee, Davis, and Jackson come upon a man who is attacking a woman. Satisfied this is Spotswood's murderer, they kill him. When they set up camp, Jackson wanders off. As Barbee and Davis find Jackson's mutilated body, Everheart and Peak catch up to them. Peak is killed in the resulting shootout, and Davis is further wounded. Everheart chases Barbee and Davis to a barn, intending to smoke them out, but Barbee kills Everheart. Convinced his wounds are fatal, Davis reveals that the gold is at the bottom of a well. That night, Barbee dreams of the bestial man, and wakes to find that Davis' throat has been slit. At Davis' request, Barbee mercy- kills Davis as he slowly bleeds to death. Barbee pretends to shoot himself in grief. When the killer reveals himself, Barbee is surprised to find it is one of Goebel's sons. After killing the boy, Barbee reaches the well. There, he is wounded by a bounty hunter, whom he kills. Barbee collects the gold, only to be attacked by Goebel's other son, a twin. Surprised, Barbee asks how they could be so evil at such a young age. The boy pushes the wounded Barbee into the deep well, where he finds Pearl's corpse at the bottom. The boy walks off, ignoring Barbee's cries.

After Duane Graves and Justin Meeks premiered an earlier collaboration, The Wild Man of the Navidad, they pitched the concept of a gritty Western to The Weinstein Company. They said that when TWC took it seriously, they focused their attention on making a tight script. Although they lost their contacts at TWC, Kim Henkel, their former film instructor, recruited them to make Butcher Boys. After that work-for-hire experience, they returned to their own project. They said people praised their script but doubted their ability to realize it within their budgetary limitations. To do this, Meeks and Graves used as many existing locations as possible. When they had difficulty shooting in a real church, they scouted locations until they found an Old West replica church that looked realistic. Filming took a total of six weeks.  Release  Kill or Be Killed premiered at the ninth Dallas International Film Festival on April 10, 2015. RLJ Entertainment released it in the United States on March 1, 2016.  Reception  Richard Whittaker of The Austin Chronicle wrote that the film's uncompromising authenticity can be a detriment, as it makes the dialog difficult to understand at times. Whittaker says the film has more of a noir feel than most Westerns, and the characters, who become more realized in the second act, are mostly shades of gray. Chris Coffel of Bloody Disgusting rated it 3/5 stars and wrote that the film is worth watching despite its flaws, which include CGI blood and a somewhat confusing narrative. Though he praised the acting of Meeks and McCarthy-Boyington, Coffel said the rest of the cast \\"leave a lot to be desired\\". Mark L. Miller of Ain't It Cool News compared it to 1960s Spaghetti Westerns, saying that it also includes themes from horror films. Miller called it \\"one of those fantastic genre mash-ups that work because it feels authentic and real\\".

Her clients include hacker Ryan Cleary linked with LulzSec, Gary McKinnon known as the \\"Pentagon Hacker\\", and Lauri Love. Career Todner qualified as a solicitor in 1987 and in her 20s became a founding member of Kaim Todner LLP, a law firm in London. Kaim Todner solicitors was formed in 1990 specialising in criminal law, with particular expertise in extradition. In the beginning of March 2016 Todner's practise was acquired by One Legal, an Alternative business structure originally set up in 2013. This came shortly after Todner announced her intention to close the practice due to Legal Aid cuts. Since acquisition by One Legal, Todner's firm Kaim Todner continued operating under the same name as part of One Legal alternative business. Karen left Kaim Todner and One Legal in September 2017. Karen continues to practice and can be found at Karentodner.com. She is a regular commentator on criminal law and extradition. Notable cases =Gary McKinnon= Todner appeared in a number of extradition cases. An early case was her successful defence of Gary McKinnon, which has set a new legal precedent in British law. McKinnon's legal team applied for a judicial review into the Home Secretary's rejection of medical evidence, which stated that, when he could easily be tried in the UK, it was unnecessary, cruel and inhumane to inflict the further stress of removing him from his homeland, his family and his medical support network. =Lauri Love= Starting in the winter of 2013, Todner started representing Lauri Love, British student who was arrested on suspicion of hacking into US military computers. Love is accused of committing the cyber attacks as part of a \\"hacktivist\\" campaign in 2012 and 2013 to protest the death of Aaron Swartz, a computer programmer who committed suicide while facing up to 35 years in US prison for charges of computer misuse. In September 2016 decision has been made to extradite Love to US. Todner said she's \\"as confident as I can be\\" about the appeal. More than 100 MPs showed support for Love's campaign to have his extradition order overturned on health grounds. In October 2016 it was announced that MP Barry Sheerman, chair of the Parliamentary Commission on Autism will write to President Obama, asking him to throw out the extradition request before he leaves office in January 2017. On Wednesday 12 October 2016, in the House of Commons during the Prime Ministers Questions, David Burrowes MP raised the case of Lauri Love and issues such as the difficulties faced by those with various forms of autism when they come into contact with the justice system. Others, including the National Autistic Society, Liberty, and The Courage Foundation, showed their support for Love's appeal. By 24 October, 105 cross-party backbenchers signed a letter to President Obama, raising \\"deep concern for safety\\" of Lauri Love, pointing out that he has \\"a long history of serious mental health issues, depression and some episodes of psychosis\\". In November 2016 Home Secretary Amber Rudd has backed decision to extradite Love to America. Todner stated she fears he will be driven to suicide if extradited, and is lodging an appeal against Home Office's decision. In a letter to the Home Office opposing Love's extradition because of the risk of suicide, she wrote \\"We.. urge you to recognise the seriousness of Mr Love's mental illness and withdraw the request for extradition to permit prosecution to proceed in England, where Mr Love would be able to stand trial on bail with the support of his close family and medical support network.\\" Love said Home Secretary should have refused to send him to the US for trial and called Home Secretary's decision to extradite him an ‚Äòaberration of justice‚Äô as his legal team Kaim Todner solicitors pointed out that no other UK citizen accused of hacking had been extradited to the US. Todner also stated that the Home Secretary should have refused to extradite Love because UK‚ÄìUS extradition treaty of 2003 is unfair and should be repealed. On 25 April 2017 High Court accepted Love's appeal against extradition, lodged by Todner on his behalf. No hearing date has yet been set, however Todner commented: \\"The reason permission has been granted is that the High Court acknowledge that the grounds raised some issues of great importance. We are delighted for these news for Lauri and will continue to do everything we can to ensure prevention of his extradition to the United States of America.\\" =David McIntyre= Starting in 2012 Todner represented David McIntyre, Queen's Lancashire Regiment soldier and a war veteran who served in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Iraq Mclntyre was accused of overcharging a US peace group for a security contract when he was running his own firm which employed a team of 20 to provide security to American clients, including the Iraqi ambassador to the US, and of overcharging US government for security services in Baghdad, Iraq. McIntyre left the Army in 2002 and set up security company called Quantum Risk. The eight counts of fraud McIntyre was charged with relate to claims that he overcharged a US peace group for a security contract when he was running Quantum Risk between December 2008 and July 2009. McIntyre's business closed in 2009, which followed by his enrolment in the Royal Military Police, for whom he served in Afghanistan. In July 2012 McIntyre was arrested in uniform in an operational setting in Afghanistan, flown out of the country 45 minutes later, and then appeared in Westminster Magistrates Court in London 36 hours later. McIntyre faced eight counts of fraud concerning a contract with the United States Institute of Peace (USIP). It was alleged he overcharged the organisation by 100,000 US dollars (¬£65,000). After the US extradition request was approved by Home Secretary Theresa May, McIntyre appealed, submitting a report from the British Army's consultant psychiatrist confirming that he suffered from PTSD. Todner commented that her firm will consider in detail the Secretary of State's conclusion and see whether they can seek Judicial Review of her decision.

Seikyo Naruse was the president of the 15th Bank(J≈´go Ginkou) and also a manager of other banks and companies. Seiichi grew up in a wealthy environment with his brothers, including Seiji Naruse and Shunsuke Naruse (diplomat), and sisters. After he graduated from Azabu Junior High School and First Higher School, Japan (Á¨¨‰∏ÄÈ´òÁ≠âÂ≠¶Ê†°), he studied in the Faculty of Letters at Tokyo Imperial University (now University of Tokyo). In his college days, he started a literary magazine \\"Shin-shichou\\"( Êñ∞ÊÄùÊΩÆ, a new trend of thought) with his classmates: Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa, Masao Kume, Kan Kikuchi and Yuzuru Matsuoka (ÊùæÂ≤°Ë≠≤). In this magazine, they made their debut as writers. In later years, Akutagawa and Kikuchi became most important novelists in Japan. Naruse was a good linguist. He learned English and German at high school and college. He learned French under a private teacher Hana Yamata (younger sister of Kiku Yamata). After he read the 10-volume Jean-Christophe, he became an admirer of Romain Rolland and his pacifist thoughts. His French was good enough to exchange letters with Rolland. Just before graduation, in cooperation with Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa, Masao Kume and Yuzuru Matsuoka, he published a Japanese version of Rolland's Life of Tolstoy (translated from its English version) by permission of Rolland himself. \\"Biography of Seiichi Naruse (1), Friendship with Romain Rolland\\", Y. Sekiguchi, Bunkyo University, 2006 Visit to the U.S.A and Europe (1916-1918) In 1916, just after graduation, he went to live in New York. He had wanted to go to Europe to see Rolland, but the World War I prevented him from doing so. Though he was enrolled at the Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, he spent much of his time going to theaters in Broadway and going to see his favorite artworks in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum and the Hispanic Society of America . He was also active in writing short stories and reports for \\"Shin-shichou\\". In answer to a journalist's request, he contributed a report \\"My First Night in New York\\" to a local newspaper the New York World. In his journal \\"Trip to Florida\\", he commented on the American journalism and segregation, which was a rare record of the American South on the eve of America's entry into the World War I. He was asked to write an essay on Japan by his friend, Waldo Frank. \\"Young Japan\\" was written in English and published in The Seven Arts (pp. 616‚Äì26, April issue, 1917). In it are fully described the hope and despair of Japanese intellectuals who were at a loss in a sudden flood of Western cultures after the Meiji Restoration.https://www.amazon.com/Seichi-Naruse-Untermeyer-Randolph- supplement/dp/B0081LLFOKhttp://themargins.net/bib/D/d24.html‚ÄúTrip to Florida („Éï„É≠„É™„ÉÄË°å„Åç)‚Äù, Seiichi Naruse, Teikoku Bungaku, November 1917 Meanwhile, he moved to Boston, where he took literary courses at Boston University and worked part-time as an explainer of ukiyo-e at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Both in New York and in Boston, he was greatly impressed with real paintings and sculptures of the great masters, which he had only seen in books in Japan. In his college days, he often put in an order at the bookstore for foreign books such as \\"Collected Drawings of Aubrey Beardsley\\". His favorites in museums in New York were Millet, Goya, Chavanne, Rembrant and Rodin. He often wrote about his exciting experiences to his friends in Japan.Letters to Yuzuru Matsuoka from Seiichi Naruse in the collection of the Kikuchi Kan Memorial Museum in Takamatsu-shi, Japan http://www.city.takamatsu.kagawa.jp/english/sightseeing/sees/kikuchi-kan- memorial-museum.htmlReprint of Seiichi Naruse's Diary (1911ÔΩû1916), Hisako Ishioka, Japanese Department, Kagawa University, Takamatsu-shi, Japan http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/40004131160 In March 1918, he set sail from New York for Europe at the risk of being attacked by German U-boats, hoping to do volunteer work for the Red Cross. He arrived safely in Paris, but as the artillery fire from Germany became severe, he was evacuated to Ryon. It was not until in the middle of July that he crossed the French border into Switzerland. In Geneva, in a small island on the lake Leman, he happened to visit a statue of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose philosophy would become a longterm subject of Naruse's research. He finally met Romain Rolland in Villeneuve. He stayed there for about 3 weeks. Day in, day out, they discussed literature and culture both in the East and the West. Naruse gave a full account of the actual situation of Japan in those days. They foretold the outbreak of the Pacific War between America and Japan. We now know the details of their discussions, because Rolland wrote down every single word that Naruse told him in his \\"Journal des Ann√©es de Guerre\\" (November, 1916ÔΩû1918), (√âditions Albin Michel, Paris). Unfortunately, the Journal was published in 1952, 34 years after their meeting in Villeneuve, 12 years after Naruse's death. On his way home from Switzerland, Naruse stayed in Pairs for a while, where he luckily encountered with the victory celebration of the World War I. He wrote his impression of it to Rolland and for a Japanese newspaper, Jiji shinp≈ç(ÊôÇ‰∫ãÊñ∞Â†±). Soon after he got home, he decided on researching into French literature as his lifework instead of writing novels.‚ÄúTravel to Switzerland (ÁëûË•ø„ÅÆÊóÖ)‚Äù,Seiichi Naruse, Chuou-K≈çron, April 1919https://www.amazon.com/Journal- Annees-Guerre-Years 1914-1919/dp/0320064557 Êà¶ÊôÇ„ÅÆÊó•Ë®òIII(1916„Éª11-1918„Éª3),ÂÆÆÊú¨Ê≠£Ê∏Ö‰ªñË®≥,„É≠„Éû„É≥„É≠„É©„É≥ÂÖ®ÈõÜ„ÄÅ„Åø„Åô„ÅöÊõ∏Êàø„ÄÅ1952 Life in Paris (1921‚Äì1925) In February 1919, he married Fukuko Kawasaki, a daughter of Yoshitar≈ç Kawasaki, granddaughter of Sh≈çz≈ç Kawasaki (Kawasaki Sh≈çz≈ç). Sh≈çz≈ç Kawasaki was the founder of the Kawasaki Shipbuilding Company (Â∑ùÂ¥éÈÄ†Ëàπ); Yoshitar≈ç Kawasaki was the vice president of it. In 1921, Seiichi took Fukuko with him to live in Paris, where he settled down to work on literary researches at the Sorbonne(University of Paris), in literary salons as their members and under private tutors.

In the early stages of his four-year stay in Paris, he assisted K≈çjir≈ç Matsukata (president of the Kawasaki Shipbuilding Company) in collecting art works for the Matsukata Collection. Naruse and Matsukata went around art dealers and galleries such as Durand-Ruel and Bernheim-Jeune, often with Yukio Yashiro. Naruse recommended Matsukata to buy works by Gustave Moreau and Gustave Courbet in particular. In 1921, he visited Claude Monet at Giverny several times with Fukuko, K≈çjir≈ç Matsukata, Yukio Yashiro, Shizuka Sakazaki (art historian) and Sanji & Takeko Kuroki(Matsukata's niece). Naruse and Fukuko were good friends of Michel Monet and Blanche Hosched√© Monet, too. In 1923, the couple visited Claude Monet with Georges Clemenceau at a hospital in Neuilly when Claude had an operation for cataract. Naruse also visited L√©once B√©n√©dite at the Mus√©e Rodin with Matsukata. Naruse bought a bust of Victor Hugo by Auguste Rodin( the original plaster figure) from B√©n√©dite himself.[http://dl.ndl.go.jp/view/download/digidepo_8210346_po_l190203.pdf?contentNo=1&alternat; \\"Biography of Sei-ichi Naruse (2)\\" Contribution to the Matsukata Collection\\", Y.

His interest had already passed away from Romain Rolland, perhaps because Rolland had become too keen on the Soviet Communist Party. Naruse's study of Romanticism covered not only literary works and theatrical arts, but also personal histories of writers, the social trends and the living conditions of the periods. In 1925, he decided to return to Japan. He had been recommended for a position at Kyushu University(, one of the seven national universities in Japan) in Fukuoka-shi, Kyushu. Teaching at Kyushu University (1925-1936) As a professor of French Literature in the Law and Literature Faculty, he taught the history of French Literature and Romanticism. His lectures were well prepared. In teaching each novel, poem or play, he shed light on the personality of the writer, took the social context into account, and cited examples from the original text. He also devoted some of his lectures to deal with comedies mostly performed at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. His successful lectures were supported by his dozens of neatly written notebooks in which he organized his massive amount of research material gathered through many years. He often compared French writers with those of other countries, setting about a project in the new genre of comparative literature.Research in French Literature, Volume I (‰ªèËò≠Ë•øÊñáÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂ Á¨¨‰∏ÄÂè∑), Seiichi Naruse, edited by the Naruse Seiichi Memorial Committee, Hakusui-Sha, 1938Research in French Literature, Volume II(‰ªèËò≠Ë•øÊñáÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂ Á¨¨‰∫åÂè∑), Seiichi Naruse, edited by the Naruse Seiichi Memorial Committee, Hakusui-Sha, 1939Naruse Library(2138 books), Kyudai-Collection(of Archives), ‰πùÂ§ß„Ç≥„É¨„ÇØ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥>ÊàêÁÄ¨ÊñáÂ∫´ Kyushu University Library https://www.lib.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ja/collections/naruse Third Visit to Paris (1935) In 1935, he was given a grant for research by the Kaln Foundation (Albert Kaln). He studied in Paris for 8 months, focusing on the theme: the influence of Lord Byron on the French Romanticism. He was also active in taking part in some official events. In May, he was invited as a guest speaker in the Great Auditorium at the Sorbonne(University of Paris). He gave a talk titled \\"Montaigne and the Wisdom of the Far East\\", in which he compared the selfless mental state of Montaigne with that of Yoshida Kenk≈ç. Kenk≈ç is the author of a famous essay named Tsurezuregusa(written in 1330ÔΩû1331). In the same auditorium, he participated in the Semicentury Anniversary of Victor Hugo's Death as a delegate from Japan. His long friendship with Romain Rolland, which was not at all strong as in his youth, was seen in his letter to his wife Fukuko in which he was concerned about a souvenir from Japan for Rolland's new wife.Montaigne et la Sagesse d'Extr√™me-Orient, Seiichi Naruse, Universit√© de Paris, Institut d'Etudes japonaises, Travaux et Conf√©rences, Fascicule II, 1935Montaigne to T≈çy≈ç no Godou („É¢„É≥„ÉÜÔºç„Éã„É•„Å®Êù±Ê¥ã„ÅÆÊÇüÈÅì), Seiichi Naruse, Bungaku-Kenky≈´ No.16, Kyushu University, 1936A Letter from Seiichi Naruse to Fukuko Naruse, dated September 5, 1935 After he returned to Japan at the end of 1935, he was in poor health.

Education Weisgarber studied clarinet with Rosario Mazzeo of the Boston Symphony and Gustave Langenus of New York. He went on to earn his performer's certificate at the Eastman School of Music (where he studied with Rufus Mont Arey) as well as bachelor's (1942) and master's (1943) degrees in composition. His composition teachers included Edward Royce, Bernard Rogers, Nadia Boulanger and Halsey Stevens. Career Between 1944 and 1960 he taught at the Woman's College of the University of North Carolina. In 1960 Weisgarber joined the faculty of the Music Department at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada where he spent the remainder of his life and career. From 1966 to 1969 he was the recipient of several Canada Council grants for the purpose of studying Japanese music in Japan where he became proficient in playing the shakuhachi. In 1974 he was a guest speaker at the Asian Composers' League conference in Kyoto and also participated in the UNESCO/ISME seminar in Tokyo. Two years later he addressed the Asian Composers' League again, this time in Taiwan, prior to which he had been a guest lecturer and visiting composer at the National University of Teheran. Weisgarber retired in 1984 and continued to compose until the time of his death. Compositions Weisgarber's catalog of compositions consists of 450 separate works from short songs to symphonies, as well as a number of scores for film, radio and television. His style of composition reflects the depth of his Asian experience as well as the traditions of his western musical education.

Background Rousey had her first fight since losing her title (and undefeated record) to Holly Holm at UFC 193 in November 2015. The event was headlined by a UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship bout between current champion Amanda Nunes and former champion Ronda Rousey. A UFC Bantamweight Championship bout between then champion Dominick Cruz and Cody Garbrandt co- headlined the event. A potential heavyweight title eliminator bout between former UFC Heavyweight Champions Fabr√≠cio Werdum and Cain Velasquez was expected to take place on the card. The pairing met previously in June 2015 at UFC 188, with then interim champion Werdum unifying the title with Velasquez's undisputed title, as he won the fight via submission in the third round. However the Nevada State Athletic Commission, after analyzing physical examinations and interviews, deemed Velasquez unfit to compete due to prior injuries, and pulled him from the event on December 24. The bout was eventually scrapped, and Werdum was removed from the card as well. Another potential title eliminator included a bantamweight bout between former champion T.J. Dillashaw and John Lineker. Matt Brown was expected to face former Strikeforce Welterweight Champion Tarec Saffiedine at the event. However, Brown was pulled from the fight on November 11 in favor of a matchup with former UFC Lightweight Championship challenger Donald Cerrone three weeks earlier at UFC 206. Saffiedine instead faced Dong Hyun Kim. Maryna Moroz was very briefly linked to a fight with J√©ssica Andrade at the event. On December 7 Moroz was replaced by Invicta FC Strawweight Champion Angela Hill. Hill was then ruled out of fighting at UFC 207 because of a rule in the UFC's anti- doping policy with USADA, but not because she had failed a drug test. The pair eventually fought at UFC Fight Night 104, with Andrade winning by unanimous decision. Subsequently, Andrade was removed from the card and was rescheduled for that event. Sabah Homasi was linked to a fight with Brandon Thatch at the event. However, Homasi pulled out due to injury and was replaced by promotional newcomer Niko Price. This was the last event in which longtime play-by-play commentator Mike Goldberg participated. He made his debut in 1997 at UFC Japan: Ultimate Japan. At the weigh-ins, former UFC Welterweight Champion Johny Hendricks and Ray Borg missed weight for their bouts, weighing in at 173.5 lb and 129.5 lb, respectively. As a result, they were fined 20% and 30% of their respective fight purses, which went to their respective opponents Neil Magny and Louis Smolka. Later, Hendricks would move up in weight to the 185 pound division, as a result of consistent weight misses.

The story is also the basis of a series of television documentaries and dramatizations released between 2011 and 2016. The book is claimed to be based on the paranormal experiences of the Cranmer family, with Bob Cranmer telling the first-person account.http://www.demonofbrownsville.com.asp  Historical basis  In March 1792 a mother and her three young children were killed by marauding Native Americans in the vicinity of Fort Pitt during the Northwest Indian War. This was done as \\"an act of terror\\" to discourage continued pioneer settlement in Western Pennsylvania and Ohio. (The killing of women and children was not a common practice by the natives, as they were always taken as prisoners to live with the tribe or ransomed as hostages.) The book maintains that this massacre occurred on the ground where the house is built and that the four individuals are buried in the front yard. The premise for the demonic infestation is that the evil spirit that precipitated the vicious killing of these innocents remained on the grounds and eventually inhabited the house that would be built there. An immigrant laborer would also put a curse on the house while it was under construction out of jealousy for its wealthy owner and his beautiful wife. The book additionally states that a local doctor would later perform many illegal abortions in the house when its owners were in need of money to maintain their servants and upper-class lifestyle. There are no records or firsthand accounts of this illegal activity but an investigative newspaper article did identify that such a doctor did exist and that local lore supported the claim that he performed many abortions. It is presented that the demonic spirit was primarily focused upon hurting and killing children. In December 1988, Bob and Lesa Cranmer and their four children moved into the house. This began the long string of events that eventually led to a ‚Äúdemonic entity‚Äù being expelled from their home in 2006 by priests of the Catholic Church.  The book  :This section is based on the version of events in Bob Cranmer's (and Erica Manfred) 2014 book The Demon of Brownsville Road. '' The house at 3406 Brownsville Road was built in 1909-10 and had three previous owners prior to the Cranmers. In December 1988 Bob and Lesa Cranmer bought the house upon being transferred to Pittsburgh by his employer. Bob states that the house was his ‚Äúdream‚Äù to own, and that it mysteriously went up for sale the same week that they began looking for a house to buy. As a young child he would often stand and stare at the house hoping that someday he could see the inside. The three-story house was built in the Craftsman style and would later be designated as a historical landmark (by Pittsburgh History & Landmarks) because of its unique design. Bob and Lesa married in 1980 while Bob was an officer in the U.S. Army. He left the service in 1986 and went to work for AT&T; in Whippany, New Jersey. Their objective was to eventually relocate to Pittsburgh, where Bob had grown up. This was unexpectedly realized quicker than they had expected as they had just built a new house in 1987. They had four children: Jessica (4), Bobby (3), David (2), and Charles (2 months) when they moved to Pittsburgh. Bob Cranmer states that the sellers seemed very anxious to move out and surprisingly accepted his first (low-ball) offer without any negotiations. During a walk-through of the house young Bobby Jr. wondered off by himself as the group went to the basement. He would soon be found on the front staircase crying and hyperventilating as if ‚Äúhe‚Äôd seen a ghost‚Äù. Lesa later expressed to Bob her misgivings about the house, that it was much too large, and furthermore ‚Äúgave her the creeps.‚Äù Bob discounted this and was determined to make this house a home for his young family. He did however ask the seller if there ‚Äúwas anything wrong with the house.‚Äù Understanding exactly what he was referring to the seller assured him that the house was fine and that Catholic Mass was conducted several times in the living room of the house. Bob thought this an odd response but took it with the reassurance that had been implied. Later the next Spring Bob discovered a small metal box buried in the front yard containing Catholic religious items. He called the previous owner who had assured him that ‚Äúthe house was fine‚Äù only then to hear him say ‚Äújust put it back where you found it.‚Äù Within weeks of moving in Bob and Lesa began to experience paranormal activity in the house. The first phenomenon they experienced was a pull-chain on a light in a coat closet that continuously wrapped itself around the light and would never remain in the hanging position. Soon other nuisance activities would begin and continued for years, the family choosing to ignore them, accepting that they shared their home with a ‚Äúspirit‚Äù. Bob would go on to hold political office in the 1990s, first as a councilman and then county commissioner, gaining significant notoriety and celebrity in the western Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh) area. Over the years the Cranmer family became increasingly dysfunctional and eventually Lesa and two of the children would experience serious mental issues which would require hospitalization. Bob had no idea that the spirit in the house had anything to do with the relational and psychological issues within his family and he attempted to manage his way through it. However, one night in 2003 his oldest son attacked him and Bob would be arrested. The next morning his elderly aunt who was living with the family was also found dead in her bed from natural causes. All charges associated with the incident would eventually be dropped but the paranormal activity in the house increased like a dam had been broken. Within a month Bob was at his wits end and decided to contact the Catholic Church for help (the Cranmers were not Catholics at the time.) The mayor of Pittsburgh, Tom Murphy, who was a personal friend of Cranmer, went to see the then Bishop of Pittsburgh, Donald Wuerl, to request the assistance of the Diocese. Wuerl would assign management of the case to Father Ron Lengwin who would eventually be assisted by several other priests and one lay person, Connie Valenti. Thus would begin a battle to cleanse the house from a demonic spirit that would take two years. Paranormal researchers from Penn State University would eventually become associated with the situation and would later move on to celebrity with a hit television show called Paranormal State. The group's leader (Ryan Buell) would later discuss the Cranmer house in an article for People Magazine. The Mel Gibson movie The Passion of the Christ is also presented in the book as playing a significant role in cleansing the house from the evil entity. The infestation of the house would come to an end in February 2006 and Cranmer would begin to write the story from notes that he had kept the next year. The book was released in 2014 with great media acclaim and Cranmer would be interviewed across the country. His reputation as a public official, combined with the involvement of other notable individuals; i.e. Mayor Thomas J. Murphy, Jr., Bishop Donald Wuerl, and Fr. Ronald Lengwin, added a foundation of credibility to the story while also attracting the attention of the Pittsburgh media. Cranmer had little to gain and his reputation to lose, yet he states that the story had to be told to verify that ‚ÄúEvil‚Äù does exist in the world. The manuscript was written by Cranmer and eventually reduced in size and rearranged by the professional author and editor Erica Manfred. She was the third of three writers employed by Cranmer as issues and conflicts kept arising which seemed intent on preventing the book from being published. The difficulties were so intense that Cranmer became convinced that Evil itself was fighting to keep the story from being told.  Criticism  With the notoriety of the book in the metropolitan Pittsburgh area, one of the two major newspapers (The Post- Gazette) decided to do an investigative article about the story. Many of the individuals in the book were interviewed and some of the historical accounts were checked. The doctor cited was verified to have been a local resident, as was his nefarious abortionist reputation, obviously with no official records existing for the decades-old illegal activities. Fr. Ron Lengwin, spokesman for the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, affirmed every aspect of the book along with the official involvement of the Catholic Church. However, the primary source of criticism came from several children or grandchildren of the two families who preceded the Cranmers' living in the house (a period of 47 years, all previous owners being deceased). They all claimed to have no recollection of any paranormal activity in the house and said that the story was fabricated by Cranmer for his own waning notoriety. Cranmer retorted that the Joyce children (of the prior owners) were upset that the reputation of their deceased parents was possibly being besmirched by the book. (Even though a fictitious name was used to identify them.) Coincidentally, the couple died of natural causes in the months just prior to the book's publication. Cranmer stated that Mrs. Joyce made it clear to both him and his wife that she \\"detested\\" the Wagners, who had sold the house to them. He stated: \\"People are always concerned that they can be held legally liable if they do not reveal to buyers problems of a spiritual nature with a house, - which I discovered is not the case in Pennsylvania. Their reactions are obviously intended to cover up the deception used in selling the house, both in 1979 and 1988. The house was not officially sold in 1941 by the original owners, but was purchased via a Sheriff's sale. The house sat empty then for an extended period and became known as the haunted house by the local children who ventured into it.\\" Cranmer also states in the book that one daughter (Barbara Wagner) who grew up in the house did (reluctantly) detail significant paranormal activity to him while he was writing the book (she died before publication). He also stated that the son of a man who had grown up in the neighborhood during the 1930s affirmed that the house was widely known to be haunted. In addition he claims that one of the sons of the previous owners (the Joyces) verified strange activity to him before that son understood that a book would cast an unfavorable light upon his deceased father. Cranmer has offered to pay for and take a lie-detector test concerning any of the claims presented in his book as long as the three adult children of the previous owners join him. Subsequent to publication (July 2016) a granddaughter of the doctor (presented in the book) contacted Cranmer to tell him that even though she was too young at the time to know of her grandfather's illegal practice, she could confirm that his personality and \\"evil demeanor\\" fit what her early memories could recall. The story didn't surprise her as she described him \\"throwing shoes at her\\" when she was a toddler. The house in 2013 Cranmer's response to the article, which was printed by the Post-Gazette three days later, is as follows: October 29, 2014 12:00 AM Any author should relish an article about their book by a major newspaper, positive or negative. However, the recent PG coverage of my book was over the top (‚ÄúFormer Residents of Brentwood ‚ÄòDemon‚Äô House Dispute Book,‚Äù Oct. 26). The front-page Sunday article clearly sought to discredit the story, its basis in Christian faith and its controversial topics. I‚Äôve dealt with the press enough to know that when an article is to have a slant nothing one says can change it. I spent almost two hours on the phone with the reporter, successfully addressing every objection, yet only a few brief comments from me were published. Once I determined that the reporter‚Äôs intent was negative, I simply braced myself. But if it prompts more reading of the book so much the better.  Aftermath  Since telling the story Cranmer's life has seen its share of tragedy. In March of 2015 his son David died unexpectedly and his wife went into depression. They subsequently ended their marriage of 37 years in 2018. He is quoted as saying during an interview \\"writing the book was like outing the mob, there's obviously going to be consequences.\\" He continues to do interviews about the book and his experience. After over a decade of the house being cleared of evil Bob opened it as a Bed & Breakfast in November 2019; \\"The Brownsville Road House\\".  Television  The Demon of Brownsville Road has been the subject of a series of programs which are dramatizations: * The Exorcist Files, The Discovery Channel (2011) * Paranormal Witness, True Terror - The Molech, SyFy (2014) * A Haunting, Demon's Lair, TLC (2016) It was announced in 2015 that the Fox Network bought the rights to the story for one year and that a new series based on the book was to be aired in 2016. However, after the pilot episode was written Fox decided to cancel the project and move forward with another program.  Cinema  It was reported in the media (9/2019) that an option to produce a movie based on the book was sold to New Line Cinema, a division of Warner Brothers Entertainment.

In 1995 he published Die Quotenmaschine, the world's first hypertext novel in German. His second novel, Mitte, was published in 2001 and praised by Der Spiegel as his 'masterpiece', followed by his third, Ponte City, in 2002. These three novels form Ohler's City Trilogy. In 2004, Ohler was invited by the German Goethe-Institut to act as writer-in- residence in Ramallah. There, Ohler wrote about the life of the Palestinians in the West Bank and published the last interview Yassir Arafat gave, shortly before his death. Ohler has also worked as writer-in-residence in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. In 2008, he co-wrote the movie Palermo Shooting with Wim Wenders, starring Dennis Hopper. In September 2015, Kiepenheuer & Witsch published Ohler's first non-fiction work, Der totale Rausch: Drogen im Dritten Reich, and the following year the book appeared in English as Blitzed: Drugs in Nazi Germany. Upon publication in the US, it became a New York Times bestseller. In the book, Ohler researches what role psychoactive drugs, particularly stimulants such as methamphetamine, played in the military history of World War II, concluding that many of the German military and political leadership‚Äîespecially Adolf Hitler‚Äîabused psychoactive drugs during the war. The book was praised by some historians: Antony Beevor calls Blitzed 'a remarkable work of research. Ohler's account makes us look at this densely studied period rather differently'; Ian Kershaw describes it as 'very good and extremely interesting ... a serious piece of scholarship very well- researched'; and Hans Mommsen, one of Germany's leading historians, refers to Blitzed as 'changing the overall picture'. However, other historians disagreed with Ohler's approach. German historian, Nikolaus Wachsmann wrote that Ohler \\"appears to mix fact and fiction. [...] He spices up the evidence, throws in pop culture references (‚ÄúTeutonic Easy Riders‚Äù), and garnishes it with snazzy puns (‚ÄúHigh Hitler‚Äù). It remains to be seen if this recipe will appeal to anglophone readers. To borrow Ohler‚Äôs style: will they experience a big buzz, or a bad trip?\\". Dagmar Herzog expressed the view that 'Ohler's analysis does not withstand close scrutiny. (‚Ä¶) Anyone seeking a deepened understanding of the Nazi period must be wary of a book that provides more distraction and distortion than clarification.' James Pugh judged that while the book is an 'engaging and entertaining piece of journalistic history', it was 'troubling based on its tone, scholarship and engagement with the literature'. Richard J. Evans, Regius Professor of History at the University of Cambridge from 2008 to 2014, author of History of the Third Reich, called Blitzed 'a crass and dangerously inaccurate account' He also wrote that the book is 'morally and politically dangerous', because it implies that Hitler was not responsible for his actions. Ohler rejected this claim. Evans replied: \\"‚Ä≤Blitzed‚Ä≤ belongs not in the world of serious history, but in the new landscape of ‚Äòpost-truth‚Äô and ‚Äòalternative facts‚Äô\\". In 2020, Ohler‚Äôs second non-fiction book appeared: ‚ÄûThe Bohemians - The Lover‚Äôs who led Germany‚Äôs Resistance against the Nazis‚Äú. ‚ÄûA detailed and meticulously researched tale about a pair of young German resisters that reads like a thriller‚Äú, writes The New York Times.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/books/review/the-bohemians-norman- ohler.html  Reviews  ‚ÄûThe strengths of Ohler‚Äôs account lie not only in the rich array of rare documents he mines and the archival images he reproduces to accompany the text, but also in his character studies‚Ä¶ Ohler effectively captures Hitler‚Äôs pathetic dependence on his doctor and the bizarre intimacy of their bond‚Ä¶Blitzed makes for provocative reading.‚Äù ‚ÄîNew York Times Book Review https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/books/review/blitzed-drugs-third- reich-norman-ohler.html ‚ÄúDelightfully nuts, in a Gravity‚Äôs Rainbow kind of way.‚Äù ‚ÄîThe New Yorker https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/20/the- writer-who-uncovered-the-nazis-drug-use ‚ÄúA fascinating, engrossing, often dark history of drug use in the Third Reich.‚Äù‚ÄîWashington Post https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-the-nazis-rode-into-battle-high- on-crystal-meth/2017/03/09/815794f0-f9fb-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html Books =Novels= *Die Quotenmaschine (1998) *Mitte (2001) *Ponte City (2003) *Die Gleichung des Lebens (2017) =Non-fiction= *Blitzed: Drugs in Nazi GermanyHigh Hitler Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Sept. 13, 2015Wenn das der F√ºhrer w√ºsste‚Ä¶ Die Zeit, Dec. 3, 2015 (2016), *The Bohemians - The Lovers who led Germany‚Äôs Resistance against the Nazis (2020), Film *Palermo Shooting, screenwriterFestival de Canne: Palermo Shooting Cannes Film Festival, October 6, 2016 (2008) References External links * * See also *The German Granddaddy of Crystal Meth, article by Fabienne Hurst, Der Spiegel, 2013 *Was Hitler ill?, by Henrik Eberle & Hans-Joachim Neumann, Polity, 2012, *Hitler's drugged soldiers, article by Andreas Ulrich, Der Spiegel, 2005 *Nazis on speed, by Werner Pieper, The Gr√ºne Kraft, 2002, *Hitler: diagnosis of a destructive prophet, by Fritz Redlich, Oxford University Press, 1998, Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:German writers Category:German journalists Category:German screenwriters Category:Male screenwriters Category:People from Zweibr√ºcken Category:Film people from Rhineland-Palatinate ","title":"Norman Ohler"},{"id":"51887123","text":"H√©da Frost (born 15 September 1936) is a French former swimmer.

Minnesota was won by the Progressive candidate, former President Theodore Roosevelt, won the state over the Democratic candidate, New Jersey governor Woodrow Wilson, by a margin of 19,430 votes, or 5.82%, while Republican incumbent President William Howard Taft came in third, with just 19.25% of the vote, and perennial Socialist candidate Eugene V. Debs came in fourth while winning the votes of 8.23% of Minnesota voters. Nationally, Wilson won the election, with 435 electoral votes and a landslide 14.44% lead over Roosevelt in the popular vote, while Taft finished third, with 23.17% of the vote, and Debs won a personal record 5.99% of the national popular vote. Nationally, the 1912 election was the first United States presidential election since 1860 in which there were four candidates who each won more than five percent of the popular vote, the first since 1852 in which the ticket of a party other than the Democratic and Republican parties finished second, and the last, , in which the ticket of a party other than the Democratic and Republican parties finished second. It was the only presidential election in American history in which an incumbent President faced both his immediate predecessor and his immediate successor in the general election. As a result of the 1912 election, Woodrow Wilson became the second of only two Democrats elected president between 1860 and 1932. It was also the first presidential election in which all 48 of the contiguous United States participated. The 1912 election was the first presidential election held since statehood in which the Republican ticket lost in Minnesota, and the only presidential election in which a party other than the Democratic and Republican parties won Minnesota's electoral votes. It was the only presidential election since statehood in which the Republican ticket failed to carry a single county in Minnesota, and the only presidential election in which the Republican ticket finished less than second in the state. Taft's 19.25% still ranks as the lowest percentage of the popular vote any Republican presidential nominee has ever won in Minnesota. The 1912 election also marked the high water point for the Socialist Party of America, both nationally and in Minnesota. No Socialist Party candidate‚Äîbefore or since‚Äîhas ever won a higher percentage of the national popular vote than Debs did in 1912, and no Socialist Party candidate for any office has won a higher percentage of the statewide vote in Minnesota. In Minnesota, Debs carried two counties (Beltrami and Lake); nationally, he carried two more (Crawford County, Kansas and Burke County, North Dakota). Minnesota would not go against the Republican Party in a presidential election again until Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt won the state in 1932. With 37.66% of the popular vote, Minnesota would prove to be Roosevelt's fourth-strongest state in terms of popular vote percentage in the 1912 election after South Dakota, California and Michigan.

He served as a chancellor for 21 years and was in 1520 rewarded with the bishopric of the Diocese of Aarhus. He was especially known for effective administration and strong defense of the Catholic Church. Following the reformation in Denmar in 1536, Bille was treated more leniently than other Catholic bishops and was released already in 1537. Ove Bille was appointed secretary of the royal chancellery, Copenhagen in 1499 and around 1506 he was appointed chancellor. On his deathbed King John recommended Ove Bille to his son Christian II. By his father recommendation Bille was made Bishop of Aarhus in 1520. In 1523 the nobles in Jutland rebelled and demanded the deposition of king Christian II. Ove Bille remained loyal to king Christian and sought to mediate between the rebels and king. During the reformation in Denmark‚ÄìNorway and Holstein in 1536 he put up a strong defense in favor of the Catholic Church. When Frederick I died in 1533 he headed the Catholic Party and tried to have the young Duke John II made the new king but after a meeting in Gammel Rye in 1534 with the councils of Jutland he had to accept Christian III instead. The proclamation of Christian III eventually led to the Count's Feud conflict and the coup d'√©tat in 1536 and the conclusion of the reformation in Denmark. Catholic bishops were subsequently stripped of their titles and the many large lands accumulated by the church was confiscated by the crown. Bishop Bille was also stripped of his title but not immediately jailed. Not until Bille refused to give over Silkeborg Castle to the king was he eventually imprisonment although still quite leniently. First he was jailed in Dragsholm Castle and later Nyborg Castle. In 1537 he was released on condition he would not work against the new social order. He was granted a lien on Skovkloster.

Lyerla, Supreme Court of South Dakota, 424 N.W.2d 908 (1988), is a criminal case in which it was found that an attempt to commit a crime with an element of recklessness is a logical impossibility; specifically that attempted second degree murder is logically impossible.Criminal Law - Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder, , Lyerla randomly shot into a truck three times after being goaded by the driver of the truck. One shot killed the driver and the others did not hit the driver or either of two passengers. Lyerla was convicted of second degree murder for killing the driver. Lyerla was convicted on two counts of attempted second degree murder of each passenger. Lyerla appealed on the ground that it is a logical impossibility to attempt second degree murder, since attempt requires specific intent and recklessness implies lack of such intent. Implied in the jury finding of second degree murder, rather than first degree murder which was also sought, was lack of specific intent to kill anyone in the truck, but rather a reckless disregard for their life. The court agreed with Lyerla and reversed the conviction. The court wrote: ::\\"In order to attempt to commit a crime, there must exist in the mind of the perpetrator the specific intent to commit the acts constituting the offence. To attempt second degree murder one must intend to have a criminally reckless state of mind...

The vessel was launched on 19 June 1978 and completed as Algobay on 11 October 1978. Algobay served ports in the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway. On 25 June 1980, she collided with the lake freighter Montrealais in the St. Clair River, damaging the bows of both vessels. Algobay was able to sail under her own power to Sarnia, Ontario, for repairs. No one was hurt, though the collision did close the shipping lane and there was a small oil spill. In 1994, the vessel was chartered to Canada Steamship Lines and renamed Atlantic Trader. The charter ended in 1997, when the vessel assumed her previous name. In 2008‚Äì2009, Algobay was rebuilt in China as a self-unloading vessel for service in the Caribbean Sea. She ran aground on 4 July 2010 near Chippewa Bay, New York, on the St. Lawrence River while carrying a load of Canadian corn. The vessel spent two days aground on a shoal before refloating and continuing on her voyage to Prescott, Ontario. On 4 October 2012, the bulk carrier was renamed Radcliffe R.

Life and work The daughter of Domingo M√©ndez Capote and Mar√≠a Chaple y Su√°rez, she made her publishing debut in April 1917 with an article titled \\"El primer baile\\" (The first dance) for the alumni newsletter of La Salle College. Her works include Memorias de una cubanita que naci√≥ con el siglo (Memories of a Cuban girl who was born with the century), considered a classic of testimonial literature. In the journalistic field, she contributed to several of her country's publications, such as Diario de la Marina, La Gaceta de Cuba, Revoluci√≥n y Cultura, Uni√≥n y Juventud Rebelde, as well as the magazines Bohemia, Social y Mujeres and the weekly newspaper Pionero. In September 1934, M√©ndez Capote was a survivor of the last voyage of the American luxury cruise liner Morro Castle.

The term has also become a catchall for the period in which those songwriting teams flourished. In actuality, most hits of the mid 1950s and early 1960s were written elsewhere. Overview The music conceived at the Brill Building was more sophisticated than other pop styles of the time, combining contemporary sounds with classic Tin Pan Alley songwriting. Productions often featured orchestras and bands with large rhythm and guitar sections, while its lyrics focused on idealized romance and adolescent anxieties, only rarely exploring more mature themes. The genre dominated the American charts in the period between Elvis Presley's army enlistment in 1958 and the onset of the British Invasion in 1964. It declined thereafter, but demonstrated a continued influence on British and American pop and rock music in subsequent years, having introduced the concept of professional songwriters to traditional pop and early rock and roll, and helping to inspire the girl group craze of the era. Other reasons for the style's decline was a tendency among writers and producers to duplicate earlier successes, resulting in many records that sounded the same, as well the changing nature of society and consumer markets. Many of the genre's composers went on to further success as part of the singer-songwriter movement later in the 1960s and 1970s.

Wearwell were also motorcycle manufacturers under the Wearwell Stevens, Wolf and Wulfruna brands. In 1928 Jack Waine and his brother George Waine took over the Wearwell Cycle Company Ltd. from the liquidators of the Wulfruna Engineering Co Ltd. The new company was registered as the Wearwell Cycle Co. (1928) Ltd and Jack's son Vincent and George's son Theo were brought on as Directors. They also purchased the plant, tools and stock-in-trade of the cycle manufacturing side of the Vulcan Manufacturing Co. (Wolverhampton) Ltd. The Wearwell Cycle Company crest By 1929 a full range of cycles was offered including tradesmen's cycles, juvenile cycles, scooters, and the distinctive 'Duplex'. In 1931 the company showed the new 'Schneider' sports machine at Olympia, and a cheaper version called the 'Wanderer'. The company produced motorcycles until the outbreak of World War II, from which point they manufactured only bicycles. The factory was partly destroyed by fire during an air raid but some production was soon restored. After World War II production of cycles continued and motorcycle production resumed. By the middle of the 20th Century, 75% of the company's production was exported to over 30 different countries. The company began sponsoring a professional cycle team through the 1950s, winning the Tour of Britain cycle race in 1953, which was amongst the team's best domestic racing highlights. Riders in the victorious Wearwell Cycle Company Team were Les Scales, John Pottier, Ian Greenfield, Trevor Fenwick, Ken Mitchell and John Welch. The Vulcan Manufacturing group went into voluntary liquidation in 1969, and its assets were sold off. In 1972 Wearwell Cycle Company was sold off and its production was moved out of Wolverhampton to Aleveley, near Bridgnorth, but was subsequently sold onto Elswick-Hooper Cycle Company where production was moved to Brigg in Lincolnshire. It survived a few more years until the company was finally closed in 1975. A great-great- grandson has revived the Wearwell name in 2017 as a cycling clothes company.

Its operations were centred at Bathurst, New Brunswick. After changing hands several times over the course of a century, Smurfit-Stone closed the mill in 2006, and sold the site to a redevelopment firm. The redeveloper, which was already defunct by January 2016, was fined $150,000 in July 2016 under the New Brunswick Clean Environment Act. History After the death of Senator Kennedy Francis Burns twinned with the disestablishment of Novelli & Company in March 1894, the St. Lawrence Lumber Company, which owned most of the mills of Bathurst and was presided by Burns, foundered. The Courrier des Provinces Maritimes reported 19 September 1895 that the Sumner Company from Moncton had purchased the SLLC from the receivers but two weeks later the same newspaper reported that the English shareholders had rejected the offer of $29,000, in favour of Adams & Co. of New York. Burns' brother-in-law Samuel Adams had combined with his own brother, Thomas D., Patrick J. Burns, Theobald M. Burns and John Flanigan to re-form Adams, Burns and Company (ABC). By November 1895 the assets in the county had been settled, and work advanced as planned over the winter of 1895. The Courrier reported in April 1897 that the ABC was in the sawmill to install electric lighting so as to operate on a 24-hour day. By 1898, the ABC possessed or licensed from the Crown 250 square miles (64,750ha) of forest. In 1899, the ABC proposed to enter the wood pulp business, and received from the County Council a 20-year exemption from the taxes it controlled, however, the proposal did not advance at this time. On 25 October 1900, the Courrier reported that the mill at Burnsville, New Brunswick (which by K.F. Burns in 1890 had been amalgamated with the mill in Bathurst) had been sold to Georges I. Theriault and Co. In 1907 the newly incorporated Bathurst Lumber Company purchased the interests of the Sumner Company. On 6 October 1909, the ABC divested itself of the East Bathurst Mill. The new owners, who were from New York state, formed the Nepisiguit Lumber Company (NLC). Also in 1909, the NLC purchased the shingle mill (near the mouth of Carter's Brook on the Bathurst harbour) of the O.F. Stacy Company, which had been in operation since 1885. The NLC had control of 650 square miles of Crown timber; with this plant the NLC proposed to produce wood pulp but in two years' time, the NLC would enter receivership and the assets reverted to the ABC. The next year, 1912, the ABC sold the whole to the Bathurst Lumber Company. In 1914, due to the diminishing supply of large trees on the North Shore, a kraft pulp mill and a sulphite pulp mill were built on the west bank of the Nepisiguit, close to town in the old Cunard farm property. The new mills each produced daily about 50 tons. Angus L.

Henderson (1891-1964) of Bathurst, N.B.\\" In 1919, the Bathurst Lumber Company bought out the Bathurst Electric and Water Power Company, which had been formed in 1904 by Act of Assembly to exploit the Tetagouche River, and in 1912 had installed a hydroelectric plant at Tetagouche Falls, about eight miles from Bathurst. In 1920, the firm purchased the Cascapedia Manufacturing and Trading Company. In 1921, the amalgamated company started to build the hydroelectric plant at Nepisiguit Grand Falls. In the same year, under a Dominion charter, the Bathurst firm was renamed the Bathurst Company Limited. The firm soon began construction of a groundwood mill and the installation of a fourdrinier machine which in 1923 produced New Brunswick's first newsprint.A Canadian Family - Genealogy and Vintage Postcards: \\"View Near Pulp Mill ‚Äì Bathurst  Forestry Fridays: Historic Views of Lumber Mills & Logging Scenes in Eastern Canada\\" The hydroelectric power dam at Nepisiguit Grand Falls was completed in 1926 at a cost to the private owners of over $3 million. The falls drop over 100 feet through a canyon of solid granite. The 400-man project of dam construction lasted a year and a half and ended in 1921. About the end of 1927, control of the firm passed to the Newsprint Bond and Share Corporation and in 1928 the Bathurst Power and Paper Company was formed by them. The local newspaper reported that $20 million had changed hands.Northern Light, \\"Bathurst Company Development in New Brunswick\\", 29 March 1928 Sir James Dunn filed suit with Angus McLean over stock options in the firm that he claimed he had been denied.Northern Light, \\"Sir James Dunn Cases Postponed Till Fall\\", 3 May 1928 The Bathurst Lumber Company No. 2 Mill (in East Bathurst) was decommissioned and dismantled in January 1928, although this NLC-vintage mill had not been in operation for a number of years prior to this date. Majority control of the company was obtained in 1936 by Arthur J. Nesbitt and his partner Peter A. T. Thomson in Nesbitt, Thomson and Company through their holding company, Power Corporation of Canada. Their first project was the construction of a pulp drying machine for the manufacture of boxboard. In 1939, the firm purchased the John Fenderson Company, which held the Jacquet River timber concessions from the Crown, and the Jacquet River Boom Company. The firm invented Bathurst Corrugating Medium (BCM) in 1950. This product is manufactured from hardwoods by means of a continuous semi-chemical process, and allowed the firm to utilize a greater fraction of the timber; in other words, less waste was generated by its activities. In the early 1950s, control of the hydroelectric plant at Grand Falls was ceded by the BPPC to a provincial Crown corporation which was named at the time the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission. On 1 June 1959 a second boxboard was commissioned. In the early 1960s, Power Corporation bought the Consolidated Paper Company. When Paul Desmarais acquired control of Power Corporation in 1968, the two companies were merged to become Consolidated-Bathurst Inc. By far the largest private employer in the city for many years, Consolidated-Bathurst in 1977 employed 586 people. In 1989, the company was sold to Stone Container Corporation of Chicago, Illinois who renamed it Stone Consolidated Inc. Stone shuttered it in 2005 because of global overcapacity in the pulp and paper business. The Bathurst plant had at the time capacity for 243,000 tons per annum of corrugated medium. The closure was brought on by the post-millennial trend towards overseas manufacture. The chairman, president and CEO of Smurfit-Stone, Patrick J.

Hume Springs has roughly 175 homes situated on four streets, East Reed Avenue, Dale Street, Edison Street, and Mark Drive. The neighborhood is bordered on the north and east by Four Mile Run Park, a 48.22 acre park that is the largest suburban park in the DC area. Directly north of Hume Springs is Four Mile Run stream and Arlington, Virginia. Directly east of Hume Springs is the Cora Kelly Recreation Center, and ¬Ω mile further is Route 1 and Potomac Yard (future site for the newest yellow line Metro station). Directly west of Hume Springs is Arlandria-Chirilagua, largely a latino El Salvadorian community since the 1980s, and home to the Birchmere concert hall, the Alexandria Aces baseball team, Four Mile Run Farmers and Artisans Market, and St. Rita‚Äôs Church, built in 1949 of stoned Gothic architecture. To the South of Hume Springs is the historic Del Ray neighborhood with numerous restaurants, sidewalk seating, annual festivals and a popular farmer‚Äôs market. The homes of Hume Springs, along with other subdivisions in the area, were originally built to house the growing federal workforce during WWII. Many incoming migrants were living in trailer parks along Route 1, and included workers at Alexandria‚Äôs Torpedo Factory and the United States Department of War employees who would later occupy The Pentagon that was being built at the same time and located less than 3 miles north of Hume Springs. History Frank Hume (1803‚Äì1906), namesake of Hume Springs Hume Springs is named for one-time owner of the land Frank Hume (1803‚Äì1906). Hume was once a confederate soldier and spy, and then a very successful grocer and liquor merchant in Washington who became a popular philanthropist. Mr Hume owned the Warwick Estate and surrounding land where a spring was located and adorned with a large stone gazebo that was often visited in summer by wealthy guests from the City of Washington. The famous spring was located in the middle of old Mount Vernon Avenue at or very near the intersection with present-day Reed Avenue but was eventually destroyed for road expansion and commercial development in the area. Picture of Hume Spring Warwick Estate was especially popular for its Fourth of July celebrations that included fireworks and cannon fire overlooking the Potomac River. Frank Hume is also the namesake of the historic Hume School built in 1891 and located on Arlington Ridge, the oldest school building in Arlington County. The land of the Hume Springs neighborhood was included in the area of land selected by George Washington to become the District of Columbia in 1791; part of the original diamond shape of the city. In 1846 the land comprising today‚Äôs Alexandria and Arlington (including Hume Springs) was returned to Virginia governance for economic reasons and concerns over the continuance of slavery. This was known as retrocession. Twenty-four years later, in 1870 when the City of Alexandria became independent of the County (now called Arlington County), the Hume Springs land remained with the County. Potomac Yard_Outskirts of Alexandria 1861-1865 In 1908 the Town of Potomac, including the Hume Springs marshland, was incorporated as a town in what is now Arlington County. It wasn‚Äôt until 1920 that the County changed its name from Alexandria to Arlington. Then in 1930 the Town of Potomac was annexed by the City of Alexandria, thus finally bringing Hume Springs under the governance of the City of Alexandria as it is today. Surrounding Wetlands Hume Springs‚Äô proximity to the expansive Four Mile Run Park and historic 11-acre tidal freshwater wetland and headlands of the nine mile stream have lent defining characteristics to the neighborhood. The wetland is part of the watershed for the nearby Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay. In the 1970s two acres of it was mostly filled-in when the stream channel was dredged in hopes of discontinuing flooding that the surrounding area was prone to. The Hume Springs neighborhood had been built on filled-in sections of tidal marsh. Picture of Hume Springs after Hurricane Eloise Also because of the highly urbanized nature of the Four Mile Run watershed, the neighborhoods and businesses adjacent to the lower portion of the stream were subjected to repeated flooding, beginning in the 1940s. In response to this flooding, Alexandria and Arlington forged a partnership in the 1970s with the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to build a flood-control channel in the lower portion of Four Mile Run. Construction of that hardened flood control channel - or levee corridor - took place during the 1970s and early 1980s. Today however, Alexandria and Arlington are jointly working to restore this lower section of the stream‚Äôs natural banks and vegetation by ‚Äúgreening‚Äù it, along with installing new paths, crossovers and other amenities that will serve the population around the future Potomac Yard metro station. This is part of the Joint Four Mile Run Restoration Master Plan, a $261 million plan to transform the stream corridor. Throughout 2015 and 2016 the media and government officials highlighted the completion of the $1.8 million Four Mile Run Tidal Restoration Demonstration Project that restored the historic 2-acre tidal wetland where the water levels fluctuate with the daily tidal cycle along Four Mile Run. 1990s to 2010s In the 1990s the Hume Springs neighborhood was known as ‚Äúthe Hole‚Äù, a place to purchase illegal drugs from what turned out to be a highly efficient drug ring. Starting in 1993 some residents of Hume Springs banded together to pressure crack dealers and discourage visiting buyers. Finally in the late 1990s, with law enforcement investigations and the ensuing ‚ÄúOperation Dirty Dozen‚Äù drug crackdown, there was mostly success in ejecting the negative elements. In 2015 Hume Springs gathered much media attention with the highly publicized refurbishment of the Hume Springs Playground Park, a partnership between RunningBrooke non-profit and the City of Alexandria. Also with its proximity to Four Mile Run Park, the area was highlighted during the December 2015 stabbing death of 22 year old Eduardo Almendarez found in Four Mile Run Park. The Hume Springs neighborhood has recently seen changes in the ethnic and racial make-up of residents as increasing numbers of young white professionals seek more affordable housing closer to Old Town Alexandria, downtown DC, Crystal City and The Pentagon. As well, the aging of established residents has influenced turn-over. In 2010 there were roughly 50% Latino (mostly from El Salvador), 20% African American and 30% White/Other.

History  Catholics, mostly Poles, were present in Vladivostok since the mid-nineteenth century. The first Catholic parish in the Siberian Far East appeared during the reign of Alexander II in the city of Nikolaevsk Amur, newly founded in 1866. The city was then the seat of the Czarist Governor General of the Russian Far East. As the imperial (later Soviet) fleet moved to Vladivostok, the new port and fortress under construction attracted a number of people who came from all corners of the Empire, including Polish Catholics, Lithuanians etc. They were artisans, merchants, simple workers or soldiers. The municipal assembly (Duma) donated the land in 1885 until 1886. The parish itself was erected on January 11, 1890, a few months before the start of the construction of the Trans- Siberian Railway to Vladivostok from May 1891. From 1923 to 2002, Vladivostok was the cathedral episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Vladivostok, which was merged into the Diocese of Saint Joseph at Irkutsk and remains a deanery.

He had more than three German patents and more than 23 U.S. patents, including a dot matrix teletypewriter (Germany, 1957), a blind-landing system for airports (1965), a phased array system for satellite communications (1971), a hybrid car system (1982), and a scanning laser diode microscope for particle analysis (1989). He was the only engineer to work on both sides of the Space Race: a lab manager for NII-88 in Soviet Union (1946‚Äì1952) and a lead engineer for the Space division of Boeing (1960s).  Early career in Germany  In 1934, he graduated from Hindenburg Polytechnic in Oldenburg, Germany with a degree in \\"Elektrotechnik\\" (electrical engineering). He then served in a minesweeper unit of Kriegsmarine (German Navy). From 1940‚Äì1945 (during WW2), he worked as an engineer and lab manager in the radar group of GEMA (see Radar in World War II). At the end of WW2, his family fled to Dresden and survived (except for one relative) the Bombing of Dresden in World War II. His family then resettled as refugees in the Bavarian town of Amberg. (Source of timeline)  Contributor to the Soviet Union's rocket and satellite programs (1946‚Äì1952)  In 1946, he was one of the more than two thousand German specialists forcibly (at gunpoint) brought to the Soviet Union under Operation Osoaviakhim. He was then one of the more than 170 German specialists ‚Äì headed by Helmut Gr√∂ttrup ‚Äì brought to Branch 1 of NII-88 on Gorodomlya Island in Lake Seliger. From 1946‚Äì1952, he was an engineer and head of the high frequency lab, working on a guidance system, among other things, for the early Soviet rocket program. He also worked on a design for a 6-dish (array) deep-space tracking station for the early Soviet space program. In 1960, the Soviet Union implemented the full 8-dish (with 52-foot diameter dishes) deep-space tracking station called Pluton in the Crimea.  Debriefing by U.S. Army (1952‚Äì1954)  In June 1952, he was released from the Soviet Union and returned to East Germany. The Berlin Wall had not yet been constructed, so he was able to cross the border via the Berlin U-Bahn from East Berlin, East Germany, to West Berlin (Western Zone). He quickly met an American MP, who put him in a safe house where he spent two months getting debriefed by the U.S. Army on the Soviet Union's rocket program. He was also interviewed over several months by Reinhard Gehlen. Later, he published a 114-page report (in German; he finalized the report in April 1954) for the Army on the Soviet Union's \\"Microwave-based Control System for Long-Distance Rockets\\". In September 1952, he was flown from West Berlin (Western Zone) to Frankfurt, West Germany, where he was reunited with his family (his wife, daughter and son), finally ending a difficult, six-year separation.  Dot matrix teletypewriter (Germany, 1957)  In 1952‚Äì1954, he filed five patent applications for a dot matrix teletypewriter (aka \\"teletype writer 7 stylus 35 dot matrix\\"), later granted in 1957 (see German patent #1,006,007). In April 1953, he was hired by Telefonbau und Normalzeit GmbH (TuN, later called Tenovis). In 1956, TuN introduced the device to the Deutsche Bundespost (German Post Office), which did not show interest. In his final contract with TuN (dated May 31, 1957), he sold the five patent applications to TuN for 12,000 Deutsche Marks and 50% of the device's net future profits (while retaining rights for the U.S. market). (8 pages) Photos and working papers of the dot matrix teletypewriter prototype were submitted to his first U.S. employer, General Mills, in 1957. A set of working papers for the dot matrix teletypewriter were published in 1961. At Boeing in 1966‚Äì1967, the dot matrix teletypewriter design was the basis for a portable facsimile machine (using dot matrix), which was prototyped and evaluated for military use by teams at Boeing, including sales.  Emigration to the United States (1957)  On June 28, 1957, he emigrated to the United States via Operation Paperclip, sponsored by an Army contract with General Mills. The contract was cancelled shortly afterwards, so he hired on as principal scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, where he worked on satellite transponder communications. He became a U.S. citizen in 1962. From 1959‚Äì1970, he mostly worked as lead engineer in the Space Division of Boeing (near Seattle). He also had a stint in the Military Products Group at Honeywell (in Seattle).  Boeing: Blind-landing system for airports (1965)  In 1965, while at Boeing, he invented a blind-landing system for airports. It was an automated blind-landing system and featured a 3D-display showing the virtual landing strip overlaid on the actual visual display. The system was not implemented.  Boeing: Phased array system for satellites (1971)  In 1971, while lead engineer in the telecommunications group of the space division of Boeing in Kent, Washington, he, along with Orral Ritchey and John Nitardy, invented a phased array system for satellite communications. The patent was assigned to Boeing and a technical paper was written. The invention won Boeing's Technical Paper Award for 1970.  F.P. Research Lab: new moisture meter (1972‚Äì1979)  In 1968‚Äì1974 (several patents granted), he invented a new moisture meter for pulp and paper mills. He co-founded F.P. Research Lab to commercialize the moisture meter. In 1979, F.P. Research Lab was acquired by BTG AB (Sweden), a technology company serving the global pulp and paper industry.  Hybrid car system (1982)  In 1982, he invented an electric propulsion and braking system for cars. The system allows for significant improvement of fuel efficiency by recycling energy from the car's braking system (regenerative braking). While clearly not the only patent relating to the hybrid electric vehicle, the patent was important based on more than 120 subsequent patents directly citing it. The system was only patented in the U.S. and not prototyped or commercialized. In 1997, with the introduction of the Prius in Japan, Toyota was one of the first companies to commercialize a hybrid electric vehicle (i.e. using regenerative braking technology). In July 2000 ‚Äì the same month the patent expired ‚Äì Toyota introduced the Prius globally (see Toyota press releases). The Prius became America's best selling hybrid electric car.  Lasentec: Particle-size analyzer (1987‚Äì1994)  In 1989, he, with son Ekhard Preikschat, invented a scanning laser diode microscope for particle-size analysis. He and Ekhard Preikschat co-founded Lasentec to commercialize it. In 2001, Lasentec was acquired by Mettler Toledo (NYSE: MTD). About ten thousand systems have been installed globally ‚Äì over $1 Billion in cumulative sales ‚Äì mostly in the pharmaceutical industry to provide in-situ control of the crystallization process in large purification systems.

It is sometimes called EM reconstruction since the main method used is the electron microscope (EM). This field is a close relative of reverse engineering of human-made devices, and is part of the field of connectomics, which in turn is a sub-field of neuroanatomy. Model systems Some of the model systems used for circuit reconstruction are the fruit fly, the mouse, and the nematode C. elegans. Sample preparation The sample must be fixed, stained, and embedded in plastic. Imaging The sample may be cut into thin slices with a microtome, then imaged using transmission electron microscopy. Alternatively, the sample may be imaged with a scanning electron microscope, then the surface abraded using a focused ion beam, or trimmed using an in-microscope microtome. Then the sample is re-imaged, and the process repeated until the desired volume is processed. Image processing The first step is to align the individual images into a coherent three dimensional volume. The volume is then annotated using one of two main methods. The first manually identifies the skeletons of each neurite. The second techniques uses computer vision software to identify voxels belonging to the same neuron, which are then corrected in the process of proofreading. Notable examples *The connectome of C. elegans was the seminal work in this field. This circuit was obtained with great effort using manually cut sections and purely manual annotation on photographic film. For many years this was the only circuit reconstruction available. Limitations and future work Understanding the detailed operation of the reconstructed networks also requires knowledge of gap junctions (hard to see with existing techniques), the identity of neurotransmitters and the locations and identities of receptors. In addition, neuromodulators can diffuse across large distances and still strongly affect function. Currently these features must be obtained through other techniques. Expansion microscopy may provide an alternative method.

He served on the Danish Riksr√•d and had a role in getting Margrethe I appointed queen. Lodehat also had a central role in the creation of the Kalmar Union and may have authored the founding documents. The surname Lodehat stems from a type of hat, Lodehat, featured on the family coat of arms but although the family has become known under this name they likely didn't use it in their own time. In 1382 he was appointed bishop of the Diocese of V√§xj√∂, in what is today Sweden. In 1386 he became bishop of the Diocese of Aarhus and was appointed to the Riksr√•d. In his new position he advocated strongly to have queen Margrethe I appointed the fuldm√¶gtige formynder (all-powerful protector) of the realm. In 1395 he became bishop of the Diocese of Roskilde, the largest and most prestigious diocese in Denmark at the time. Lodehat participated in most meetings related to the Kalmar Union and in 1397 he sealed the founding Kalmarunionsbrevet (Letter of the Kalmar Union). When Margrethe I died Lodehat had her body moved to Roskilde Cathedral. In his last years he supported king Eric of Pomerania's policies towards Schleswig.

There has been growing academic and industry interest in the behavioral animation of autonomous actors in virtual worlds. However, it remains a considerable challenge to author complicated interactions between multiple actors in a way that balances automation and control flexibility. Several varieties of behavior authoring systems have been created.  The BML Sequencer and Smartbody  Behavior Markup Language (BML) is a tool for describing autonomous actor behavior in simulations and computer games. SmartBody is a framework for animation of artificial intelligence conversation agents to provide a more lifelike simulation.SmartBody: Behavior Realization for Embodied Conversational Agents, Thiebaux, M., Marshall, A., Marsella, S., Kallman, M., Proc. of 7th Int.

SmartBody allows for complex behavior realization, synchronizing speech recordings with non-verbal behaviors by using the Behavior Markup Language (BML). However, there remain two problems for using BML and SmartBody to achieve the vision that an artist has for animating the character: the authoring problem and multi-party behavior synchronization. The BML Sequencer addresses both.  Behavior authoring in real-time strategy games  Behavior authoring for computer games consists of first writing the behaviors in a programming language, iteratively refining these behaviors, testing the revisions by executing them, identifying new problems and then refining the behaviors again.

He lives and works in New York City. Beasley was included in the Whitney Museum of American Art's Biennial in 2014 and MoMA PS1's Greater New York exhibition in 2015.  Education and early life  Kevin Beasley was born in Lynchburg, Virginia. He received a BFA from the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, Michigan in 2007 and an MFA from Yale in 2012.  Work  Beasley is known for sculpture that incorporates found materials - especially clothing - and casting materials like resin and foam. While these materials cure or set into their final state, Beasley works them with his body, a process that points to his interest in sculpture that traces of the artist's body while retaining a bodily, fleshy quality of its own. Many of his sculptures also contain audio equipment or are used in sound-based installations or performances.  Notable exhibitions  Beasley was included in the Whitney Museum of American Art's 2014 Whitney Biennial. Beasley created a site-specific installation consisting of several sculptures with embedded microphones to pick up the ambient signs of the Biennial and its visitors. The sculptures incorporated sneakers and cast plastics, common materials in Beasley's work. Beasley was also included in the Museum of Modern Art's 2014-15 exhibition Cut to Swipe, which focused on electronic and new media works. In 2015, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum included two works by Beasley in the exhibition Storylines: Contemporary Art at the Guggenheim. Strange Fruit: Part I and Strange Fruit: Part II are assemblages of shoes and other found materials with embedded microphones and speakers that reflect ambient sound back to museum visitors. The reference to the iconic protest song \\"Strange Fruit\\" and the use of Air Jordans in the sculpture point not only to the bodies of the visitors, but to Black bodies throughout history. Strange Fruit: Part I and Strange Fruit: Part II were commissioned by the Young Collector's Council of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum for Storylines and are now part of the museum's collection. Beasley participated in the Studio Museum in Harlem's 2014 exhibition Material Histories at the culmination of an 11 month residency at the museum from 2013-14. Material Histories showcased work by Beasley and two other artists- in-residence during the same period. Beasley's solo exhibition, \\"A view of a landscape\\", is currently on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art from Dec 15, 2018‚ÄìMar 10, 2019. It is his first solo exhibit at a New York museum. The exhibition features an immersive installation that centers around a cotton gin motor from Maplesville, Alabama and the history of his family's land in the American South. The installation focuses on the sensorial, through the visual and auditory distillation of the cotton gin throughout the space. In addition, a series of live performances (solo and collaborative) and talks are programmed throughout the run of the exhibition.  Performances  Beasley is also known for his performance work, in which he often uses his sculptures to produce live sound. For a performance during the 2014 Whitney Biennial, Beasley \\"played\\" several of his sculptures by touching and moving them around the gallery. The sounds made by his body and the materials of the sculptures were captured by microphones embedded in the sculptures and amplified by speakers for the audience. Beasley also performs sound art without sculpture - in 2012 he performed I Want My Spot Back in the Atrium of the Museum of Modern Art - a piece consisting only of a capella clips of deceased 1990's era rappers, mixed and amplified by Beasley live. Over the course of his 2018-2019 solo exhibition, \\"A view of a landscape\\" at the Whitney Museum, Beasley features live performances with: Taja Cheek, Eli Keszler, Jlin, and himself. The cotton gin serves an instrument in the performances, where artists are able to manipulate and process its sounds into live compositions.  Collections  * The Solomon R.

In 1926 the company name changed to the Hoyal Body Corporation. History The company was founded in 1921 by a Mr Chalmer, H. Hamilton Hoyer and H. W. Allington with a factory in Hamworthy near Poole A-Z of British Coachbuilders. Nick Walker. Bay View Books 1997. and offices at 41 Charing Cross Road, London. The company policy was not to seek individual customers but to deal with volume sales to motor manufacturers. It would achieve this either by providing the maker with bodies or providing extra coachwork designs under its own name. 1926 Morris Oxford with Chalmer & Hoyer coachwork In 1924 a second factory was opened in Weybridge. A major contract had been agreed with Morris to provide closed bodies for the Oxford model and by 1925 this accounted for the entire output of Weybridge. The company took a stand at the London Motor Show from 1922 and in 1923 showed a Bentley with Weymann coachwork, being the first British coachbuilder to take out a licence. In 1926 Morris opened its Pressed Steel factory and moved over to steel bodied cars leaving the Weybridge works with little to do. In the same year the company was renamed as the Hoyal Body Corporation taking a brand name they had been using for some time composed of the first letters of Hoyer and Allingham. 1927 Star with Hoyal coachwork After losing the Morris contract Hoyal concentrated on bus bodies at Weybridge and boat building at Poole. Individual body orders were now also welcomed but the company was losing money and in August 1931 a receiver was appointed and Hoyal closed down. Aftermath Two employees purchased some of the equipment and tooling and set up as John Charles & Co near Kew Gardens, London. H. W. Allingham started a company called Vehicle Developments and designed standard pressed steel body parts for cars.

It ran northwest off the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway (OA&PS;) from a junction about northwest of the town of Madawaska. The line originally ran about to McCauley Lake, but was later extended another into the bush near Kitty Lake. History The line was built by lumber baron John Rudolphus Booth, who also built the OA&PS.; The line is named for John Egan, the owner of 250 square miles of land in today's Algonquin Provincial Park. Egan had developed the land by opening several \\"depot farms\\" that sold produce to the workers in the surrounding areas. Egan died in 1854, and after lying relatively unused for some time, Booth purchased the 650 square kilometer estate in 1867. He built the current town of Madawaska on the southeast corner of the plot, centralizing development in the area, which had formerly seen only a few plots from settlers travelling into the area on the Opeongo Road. Construction of the OA&PS; took place between 1885 and 1896 and the Egan Estates Railway was built sometime during this period. Madawaska became the divisional point for the OA&PS;, and a large lumber yard was constructed there. As the logging areas in the present Algonquin Park were used up, the work focused more on the Madawaska area, and Booth moved to the town. With the abandonment of the Nosbonsing and Nipissing Railway (N&N;) in 1912, another of Booth's lumber railways, the N&N; charter was used for the Egan Estates, although it was rarely referred to this way. The Madawaska area was also logged out by the 1920s, which combined with the effects of World War I and the Great Depression, led to a crash in the square log market. The OA&PS; ran a train every 15 minutes at its peak, with 4 passenger trains a day, but by 1926 this was down to 1 to 2 trains a week. During the 1930s, much of the Egan Estates line was lifted and shipped out, along with much of the OA&PS; infrastructure in Madawaska. Route The starting point for the Egan Estates Railway was a branch point northwest of the town of Madawaska, Egan Estates Junction. The OA&PS; runs west-northwest through town, bending slowly northward to skirt the northern edge of a line of high hills and then turning westward and finally southwest when it meets the Madawaska River to the west of the town. The branch point wyed off to the west, crossing the Madawaska and then following the modern path of McCauley Lake Road. When trees in this area were used up, the end section of the line was lifted and re-laid and extended running northward from a point just short of McCauley Lake. This follows the modern Major Lake Road, continuing past its current end to pass between Billy Lake and Oran Creek, crossing the Opeonogo River east of Farm Lake, and then turning westward to end in the bush between Kitty Lake and Farm Lake. The original route has been mostly reused for access roads. The endpoint, \\"End of Steel\\", now features the rentable Kitty Lake Ranger Cabin, built using materials from the original logging camp.

It is a popular activity in town and there is an annual tournament, held during Semana Santa every year, with fights held on Good Friday. The tournaments began as a punishment to criminals who'd then have to fight it out amongst themselves; since 1900, it developed into an open contest in which anyone can participate, and winners receive trophies. Rules Chivarreto boxing rules differ from traditional, amateur or professional boxing rules in that, at Chivarreto, no boxing gloves are used, fighters instead fight bare- knuckled. Typically, there are four referees present to enforce rules and protect fighters from unnecessary harm, instead of one as in other types of boxing. Bouts are held inside a ring, which is placed near Chivarreto's plaza in order so that all of Chivarreto's residents and also tourists from other areas can be spectators. Unlike other types of boxing, knockouts are declared immediately after one contestant hits the floor due to a punch being connected on him or her. Knockouts are also declared if one of the contestants quits. If a knockout does not happen after a while, it is up to the contestants to decide when to finish their bout, after which the four referees decide upon a winner.

It is three times the radius of the sun, but due to a temperature of 63,000 K it is 190,000 times as luminous as the sun. WR 135, together with WR 134 and WR 137, was one of three stars in Cygnus observed in 1867 to have unusual spectra consisting of intense emission lines rather than the more normal continuum and absorption lines. These were the first members of the class of stars that came to be called Wolf-Rayet stars (WR stars) after Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet who discovered their unusual appearance. It is a member of the carbon sequence of WR stars, indicated by the lack of nitrogen lines and the strength of carbon emission. WR 135 has a spectrum with CIII emission slightly stronger than CIV, leading to the assignment of a WC8 spectral type. The spectrum also shows strong HeI emission and weaker lines of HeII and CII. WR 135 is less than a degree away from WR 134 and the two are believed to lie at approximately the same distance from Earth within the Cygnus OB3 association. Both stars lie within a shell of hydrogen thought to have been swept up from the interstellar medium when one or both stars were on the main sequence.

He served in the United States Army in the 3rd Cavalry after graduating from West Point in 1881. After serving at Fort D.A. Russell, Davis was transferred to the Southwest to serve at San Carlos in 1882 during the Apache Wars where he commanded two companies (B and E) of Apache Scouts alongside Captain Emmet Crawford. In 1886, he played a key role in ending the Geronimo Campaign. Davis penned numerous journals about his service and the Apache language; toward the end of his life, he wrote a biography of Geronimo. Army service The son of Edmund J. Davis, former Governor of Texas, Davis graduated 44th in his class at the US Military Academy, West Point in June 1881, and was commissioned to serve at Fort D.A. Russell. In the spring of 1882, Davis received orders to the Arizona Territory to take command of companies B and E of the Apache Scouts. On May 15, 1885, a group of well-armed Chiricahuas including Nana and Geronimo, confronted Davis outside his tent and confessed to an all night tiswin drinking session and demanded to know what the army intended to do about it. Knowing that the Apaches were goading him into confrontation, he telegraphed General George Crook. The telegram was received by Captain Francis C. Pierce, who took it to Al Sieber, Chief of Scouts. Sieber, hungover himself, dismissed it as a \\"tiswin drunk\\" and the message went no further. Waiting for orders, Davis took no action and as days turned into weeks, the Apaches suspected that a massive reprisal was coming down in the form of military action. Geronimo, fearing an arrest, fled from San Carlos accompanied by Chihuahua, Naiche, Mangus, Nana, Ulzana and their bands . The Apaches made way to Mexico and were in turn pursued by Davis and Lieutenant Marion Perry Maus. Later life and death After resigning from the Army in 1886, Davis became superintendent of the Corralitos Mining and Cattle Company in Chihuahua, Mexico. In 1924 he retired to San Diego, California where he wrote a biography of Geronimo titled The Truth about Geronimo, which was published after his death. He was portrayed by Matt Damon in the movie Geronimo: An American Legend.

The Tarfaya Basin is located offshore of the city of Tarfaya near the southern border of Morocco.Map of Morocco, CIA World Factbook. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/geos/mo.html 225x225px The Tarfaya Basin is a structural basin located in southern Morocco that extends westward into the Moroccan territorial waters in the Atlantic Ocean. The basin is named for the city of Tarfaya located near the border of Western Sahara, a region governed by the Kingdom of Morocco. The Canary Islands form the western edge of the basin and lie approximately 100 km to the west. Tarfaya Basin is characterized as a passive continental marginal basin. Other basins of northwestern Africa, along the Atlantic Ocean margin all formed in a similar manner. To the north, the Tarfaya Basin is bordered by the Agadir and Essaousoura Basins, and to the south it is bordered by the Aauin Basin in Western Sahara. Additionally, the Tarfaya Basin and the other basins of northwestern Africa have been characterized as analogs and conjugates to the Nova Scotia Basin offshore from Canada. Geologic history =Rifting and early oceanic spreading= The initial rifting of Pangea began 260 million years before present during the Late Permian and persisted through the Triassic. Throughout this stage of rifting, the continental crust was thinned and separation of North America from northwestern Africa began. Normal faulting in a northeast-southwest direction created a series of grabens and half-grabens developed as the thinned crust subsided. Subsidence led to the formation of a shallow basin without forming an ocean. leftIn Figure B, seafloor spreading resulted in the formation of the Atlantic Ocean. The dimensions of the graben and half-graben basins range from 20‚Äì30 km in width, east to west and 50‚Äì100 km in length, north to south. Initial infilling of the basins began via transport of sediment from continental stream and river basins concurrently with the rifting during the Late Triassic as rivers transported red-brown sediment, characteristic of the geologic period. Up to 5,000 meters of these red-brown sediment beds were deposited through the Late Triassic. At 200 million years before the present, prior to the beginning of oceanic spreading, the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province created igneous sills and dykes that overlay the late Triassic sedimentary rocks.Hafid, M., 2000. Triassic-early Liassic extensional systems and their Tertiary Inversion/Essaouira Basin, Morocco. Marine and Petroleum Geology, Issue 6, pages 409-429. At the beginning of the Jurassic, the early basin remained narrow but was subject to transgression by seawater. This resulted in the creation of a shallow sea that was often subject to large changes in water depth. As saltwater filled the shallow sea, evaporation caused the loss of seawater while leaving salt in the basin. Over the course of 1 million years, upwards of 1,500 meters of salt was deposited. Salt migration began during Jurassic with sediment loading. However, the main mechanisms for the salt migration developed later.Tari, G. and Jabour, H., 2013. Salt tectonics along the Atlantic margin of Morocco. Geological Society of London, Special Publications 369, doi 10.1144/SP369.23. =Oceanic spreading and Jurassic deposition= Oceanic spreading began in the Early Jurassic, allowing for the stabilization of the water levels in the Atlantic Ocean. Spreading rates have been variably calculated by different models at 8 mm/year Labails, C., Olivet, J., Aslanian, D., Roest, W., 2010. An alternative early opening scenario for the Central Atlantic Ocean. Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Issue 297, pages 355-368 and at 20 mm/year.Hafid, M., Tari, G., Bouhadioui, D., El Moussaid, I., Echarfaoui, H., Aƒ±t Salem, A., Nahim, M., Dakki, M. Continental Evolution: The Geology of Morocco. Chapter 6: Atlantic Basins.. Michard, A., ed., Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg, 2008. What can be agreed is that initial oceanic spreading proceeded at a slow rate and later increased significantly. The spreading rate doubled through the Middle Jurassic allowing for accommodation space in a wider basin. Another factor that affected accommodation space was subsidence rates of 150 mm/year that resulted from seafloor spreading. Through the Jurassic, the Atlantic margin along the coast of Morocco developed large carbonate ramps. These ramps grew thicker and wider throughout the Jurassic through periods of oceanic spreading and subsidence. As the crust thinned and subsided, additional space in the shallow early Atlantic Ocean allowed for the development of new layers on the carbonate ramp. Carbonate reefs developed as Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian platforms eventually grew into reef mounds. As the Jurassic ended, carbonate platform growth slowed. A late Jurassic regression exposed the carbonate reefs and platforms. This exposure of the carbonates led to severe erosion and creation of karsts on the carbonate ramp.Wenke, A., Zuhlke, R., Jabour, H., Kluth, O., 2011. High-resolution sequence stratigraphy in basin reconnaissance: example from the Tarfaya Basin, Morocco. First Break, Volume 29, 85-96. =Cretaceous delta development= As sea levels began to rise again during the early Cretaceous, the exposed Jurassic shelf was flooded. Increased temperatures during the Cretaceous, along with increased erosion inland, resulted in the transport of large amounts of clastic materials. Fine-grained clastics formed the basis of deltaic complexes along the coastal margin. Increased accommodation space during highstands allowed for the deposition of silty material over the carbonates of the former Jurassic shelf. These silty materials eventually buried the carbonates as prograding deltas developed in the Early Cretaceous. Within these deltaic sequences, a number of shale units were deposited.Davison, I., 2005. Central Atlantic margin basins of North West Africa: Geology and hydrocarbon potential (Morocco to Guinea).

Marine and Petroleum Geology, Issue 29, pages 35-49. =Atlas Mountains uplift and inversion and Cenozoic deposition= Near the end of the Cretaceous and the beginning of the Tertiary, the African and Eurasian continental plates converged and collided, the Atlas Mountains were created by uplift. This reactivated the underlying faults along the Atlantic margin and caused compression. As the Atlas Mountains increased in elevation, sedimentation rates increased. These sediments were transported throughout the Tertiary to the Atlantic Ocean deep basin during early Cenozoic lowstands. As the Atlantic Ocean has continued its spreading to modern times, sedimentation has occurred via clastic deposition of fine-grain aeolian clastics and hemipelagic sediment. The result has been thinly bedded shale deposits that have grown in thickness over time.El Jorfi, L., S√ºss, M., Aigner, T., Mhammdi, N., 2015. Triassic ‚Äì Quaternary sequence stratigraphy of the Tarfaya Basin (Moroccan Atlantic): Structural evolution, eustasy and sedimentation. Journal of Petroleum Geology. Volume 38, Issue 1, pages 77-98. Major sources and reservoirs of hydrocarbons =Paleozoic source and Early Jurassic reservoir= Onshore studies of outcrops associated with the rift zone have identified Silurian shales and Devonian limestones as potential sources for hydrocarbons. The Late Triassic and Early Jurassic red-brown conglomerates and sandstones have been identified as the potential reservoir. However, wells have not targeted these intervals due to current depths, there is a high probability that potential sources of hydrocarbons have matured past the point of oil and gas generation. =Jurassic carbonate source and Early Cretaceous sandstone reservoirs= Thick dolomites and carbonates deposited during the Jurassic contain relatively low total organic content, below 5%, have reached the proper maturity for gas generation. This gas has migrated into sandstone reservoirs of Aptian and Albian age. =Cretaceous shale source and Paleogene turbidites and submarine fan reservoirs= The Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event in the mid Cretaceous deposited shales with an average organic content 6-10%, including samples that have reached over 15% organic content. On average, these shales have thicknesses of 22 meters. Overlying shales provide additional thickness for the source rocks of this system. The maturity levels for the shales range from immature to the main oil window. The petroleum generated from these shales has migrated to deep-water turbidites and submarine fans generated in the Paleogene. These reservoir sands range from 50‚Äì150 meters in thickness. Potential mechanisms for hydrocarbon reservoirs =Salt Structures= left The thickest salt deposits occurred in isolated grabens and half-grabens following the initial rifting, prior to oceanic spreading leading to a series of thick salt sheets. As oceanic spreading proceeded and carbonate shelves developed, sediment loading led to the upward migration of these salt sheets due to the differences in buoyancy. Initially, these salt structures became typical salt domes and diapirs. The upward migration of salt resulted in faulting of the Jurassic carbonates and Cretaceous shales. This has created numerous blocks where hydrocarbons may accumulate. These blocks include rollover faults and anticline structures. left With the beginning of the Atlas Mountains orogeny and basin inversion, the salt domes and diapirs experienced lateral migration due to compression. This lateral migration deformed the salt, leading to the development of diapirs consisting of wide canopy-shaped tops. Cenozoic Inversion and Salt Migration - With the inversion of the Atlas Mountains, faults were reactivated and caused salt domes to shear toward the basin. This resulted in large canopy tops to the salt structures. Additionally, some diapirs have been fully separated from the base of the salt, creating salt sheets within younger formations. Since the inversion and deformation occurred in the late Cretaceous and early Tertiary, all of these salt formations have been covered by shales and sandstones deposited during these intervals. As upward migration continues, the rock overlying the salt has been deformed into anticlines where hydrocarbons may accumulate. Since these salt formations have a wide lateral extent, increased difficulty has been experienced in all phases of exploration. Seismic interpretation below the canopies is more difficult to effectively process. Additionally, drilling costs through the salt formations to reach the underlying rocks serving as potential reservoirs has decreased the economic viability of wells in the region. =Seals= The base of the salts deposited in the early rift phase serves as a probable seal for late Triassic red conglomerates as well as early Jurassic sandstones. Of higher importance in the basin, a number shale intervals provide caps over reservoir sands. In the Cretaceous, deposition during the Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event produced thick shale intervals up to 22 meters thick. They mark an important seal capping gas reservoirs in early Cretaceous sandstones sourced by Jurassic carbonates.Zuhlke, R, Bouaoudab, M. Ouajhainb, B, Bechst, T., Leinfelder, R. Quantitative Meso-Cenozoic development of the eastern Central Atlantic continental shelf, western High Atlas, Morocco. Marine and Petroleum Geology, Issue 21, pages 225-276. These mid-Cretaceous shales also serve as source rock for reservoirs found in Paleogene turbidites and basin fan complexes. During the Cenozoic, shale intervals deposited in the Miocene reach thicknesses over 1,000 meters. These formations cap Eocene and Oligocene turbidites and basin fan complexes, as well as sandstones deposited above salt diapirs. Exploration and production history The Kingdom of Morocco created the Office of Hydrocarbons and Mining (ONHYM) in 2003 following amendments to laws governing hydrocarbon exploitation in order to encourage foreign investment. The ONHYM serves as both a minerals ministry and nationalized oil company. In recent years, the number of exploration contracts to conduct seismic surveys granted by the Moroccan government has increased. As of 2015, the ONHYM is in partnership with more than 20 companies from Europe and North America to explore 78 offshore projects. Morocco seeks first to utilize oil and gas discoveries within Morocco and has no current plans to begin petroleum or natural gas exports. Within the Tarfaya Basin, ten companies are currently operating in the region and include Dana, Petronas, Repsol, San Leon Energy, Statoil, Suncor Energy Inc, Chevron, BP, and Kosmos Energy.Benkhadra, A., 2015. Annual Report, 2015. Morocco National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines. The ONHYM has divided the Tarfaya Basin into blocks for exploration purposes. Presently, no wells in the Tarfaya offshore blocks have proven to be economical due to a variety of factors including the falling prices of oil and gas, reservoir maturity, and lack of volume. Thus, no offshore discoveries have made it to full production. Due to the presence of hydrocarbons during previous exploration activities, partner companies have not abandoned the Tarfaya Basin and continue exploration activities, including acquisition of additional seismic surveys. Preparations are ongoing for the drilling of additional wells pending market rebounds. Following the decline of oil prices in 2014, activity in exploratory wells was suspended. Numerous companies continue their activities in Morocco because of favorable economic conditions and political stability. However, plans for future drilling, according to ONHYM, are expected to proceed by 2020.

The Niger Delta is one of the world‚Äôs major hydrocarbon provinces; specifically, it ranks 12th in terms of known accumulation of hydrocarbons with reserves exceeding 34 billion barrels of oil and 93 trillion cubic feet of gas. Oil and gas is predominantly extracted from the Agbada Formation and is targeted from structural traps there. The Delta Field produces from the only identified petroleum system in the Niger Delta region, the Tertiary Niger Delta (Akata‚ÄìAgbada) Petroleum System. Throughout the region, oil and gas is predominantly extracted from the Agbada Formation where it is targeted from structural traps.  Geologic history and depositional processes  The Niger Delta Basin is an extensional rift basin where rifting occurred from the Late Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous. Cretaceous fracture zones, expressed as trenches and ridges, control the tectonic framework of the delta and separate the margin into individual sub-basins, which form the boundary faults of the Cretaceous Benue- Abakaliki trough. The Niger Delta Basin is the youngest and most southern sub- basin (located at the southwest boundary) in the Benue-Abakaliki trough. The Benue-Abakaliki trough represents a failed arm of a rift triple junction associated with the opening of the South Atlantic. Key to understanding the Delta Field is the formation of the Niger Delta. Since the Eocene, the Niger Delta has been prograding to the southwest with sediment coming from the Niger River. As the delta progrades, growth-fault-bounded depobelts are created. These depobelts represent the most active portion of the delta at each stage of its development. They also represent a change in regional dip of the delta. Each depobelt is composed of genetically similar sediments that are diachronous. There are three main provinces of depobelts within the delta: the northern delta province, central delta province, and the distal delta province. The provinces are delineated based on structure. The Delta Field falls into the northern delta province, which has the oldest growth faults compared to the other provinces.  Stratigraphy  The Cretaceous lithology of the Niger Delta Basin is only known due to the adjacent basin to the northeast, the Anambra Basin. There, the Cretaceous section is exposed and we get a glimpse into the stratigraphy. Lithology of the Niger Delta Basin above the Cretaceous is known from drilling and coring efforts within the basin.thumbStratigraphic column of the Niger Delta.

Paleocene: major transgression event, which is when the Akata shale began being deposited. Eocene: coastline switched from concave to convexly curvilinear, resulting in longshore drift causing wave-dominated sedimentation. Cenozoic to Recent: prograding deltaic facies including the Akata, Agbada, and Benin Formation. Today, delta sedimentation is still wave-dominated. Three large-scale lithostratigraphic units within the Tertiary have formed as the result of long-term progradation onto the Atlantic Ocean passive margin. They are distinguished from one another on the basis of their sand-to-shale ratios. = Akata Formation = The Akata Formation underlies the entire base of the delta. It is composed of marine pro-delta shales and turbidite sands that have been deposited since the Paleocene. Minor amounts of clay and silt are also present. Since the formation has not been drilled, it is only estimated that the formation is up to 7,000 meters thick. = Agbada Formation = The Agbada Formation, which overlies the Akata Formation, contains paralic siliciclastics and are considered to be the main deltaic sequence. The formation contains the most economically exploitable hydrocarbon in the region. According to biostratigraphy‚Äî specifically the presence of Sphenolitus heteromorphis, Praeorbulina glomerosa, Discoster deflandreim and Sphenolithus moriformis‚Äîthe formation was deposited over 6-7 million years during the Middle to Late Miocene. In the Delta Field, gamma ray logs show a coarsening upward trend within the Agbada Formation, which shows the regression of depositional environments within the delta. In the Delta Field, the top of the Agbada Formation is at approximately 3000 feet below sea level, at the base of freshwater sands. The base of the formation is 8000 feet below sea level. The formation thickens basinwards towards the offshore depocenter. = Benin Formation = A fluvial and upper coastal plain facies that has been deposited since the Oligocene and, like the Akata and Agbada Formations, extends across the entire delta. The Benin Formation overlies the Agbada Formation, and consists of sands that are up to 2000 meters thick at some places in the delta.Avbovbo, A.

Niger Delta in divergent/passive margin basins, in J. D. Edwards and P. A. Santogrossied, eds., Am. Assoc. Petrol. Geol. Memoir, 48: 201-238. When the delta was deposited, it was a prograding extensional complex with marine shales below. The extensional system contains large scale, basin-dipping normal growth faults that trend northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast.Hosper J (1971). The geology of the Niger Delta area, in the Geology of the East Atlantic continental margin, Great Britain, Institute of Geological Science, Report, 70(16): 121-141 The growth faults in the northern delta province are mostly rotational, increase in steepness seaward, and are evenly spaced Along with the growth faults, rollover anticlines, shale ridges, and shale diapirs exist in the basin and can be seen in the schematic structural profile of the Niger Delta. The Delta Field is located on the dominantly extensional proximal margin of a major collapse structure. The general structure of the Delta Field has two main fault blocks that are separated from one another by a major normal fault; the western block is the footwall that is dropped relative to the eastern block. Another fault exists in the NE part of the field and is characterized by a minor horst.  Petroleum system  Examples of Oil Traps in the Niger Delta from USGS Open-File Report 99-50-H (1999) = Trap and seal = Trap and seal formation in the Tertiary Niger Delta (Akata‚ÄìAgbada) Petroleum System is related to gravity tectonics within the delta. In the Delta Field, growth faults provide transportation pathways from the Akata formation to the Agbada Formation. Anticlinal closures and fault assisted closures are found in the Delta Field and can act as structural traps, which developed during synsedimentary deformation of the Agbada paralic sequence. Wells in the western fault block target a rollover anticline. To date, structural traps have only been explored in the Delta Field but stratigraphic traps are present in deeper and more distal portions of the delta. Structural traps mainly include rollover anticlines and fault closures. The primary seal for the delta is the interbedded shales within the Agbada Formation. The seals can be classified into three types: (1) clay smears along faults, (2), interbedded shale aided by fault placement, and (3) vertical seals. Clay-filled canyons exist on the delta slope; the canyons formed as the result of major erosional events in the Middle Miocene. = Source Rock and Reservoir = For the Delta Field, the main source rock is the Akata Formation with the Agbada Formation acting as the reservoir rock. However, interbedded shale in the lower Agbada Formation also acts as a source rock. However, the Agbada source rock intervals rarely have the thickness needed to be considered a world class oil province. A 1980 study of source rocks throughout the delta shows total organic carbon (TOC) ranges from 0.4% to 14.4%.Ekweozor, C.M., and Okoye, N.V., 1980, Petroleum source-bed evaluation of Tertiary Niger Delta: American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin, v. 64, p 1251-1259.

Another study‚Äî who studied the TOC in sandstones, siltstones, and shales‚Äîshow TOC averages of 1.4% to 1.6% and note that TOC decreases with decreasing age.Bustin, R.

Schematic showing the location of lobes of the early Niger Delta, prolific oil centers, and shale prone areas. (USGS Open-File Report 99-50-H, 1999).In other areas of the Niger Delta, particularly in deeper water settings, delta slope and deep turbidite fans are the depositional systems of the source rock, which have organic matter of a terrestrial signature as well as amorphous, hydrogen-rich matter from bacterial degradation. Other studies have speculated that Cretaceous shales could also be source rocks but, because they have not been drilled, no data exist to identify the potential.

Hydrocarbons throughout the delta and in the Delta Field are produced from the Agbada Formation, mainly in the form of sandstone and unconsolidated sands. Thicker sand reservoirs represent stacked channels and point bars, distributary channels, and coastal barrier bars are important reservoir types in the delta. The paralic sandstones have porosity values of 40% and 2 darcys permeability.Edwards, J.D., and Santogrossi, P.A., 1990, Summary and conclusions, in, Edwards, J.D., and Santogrossi, P.A., eds., Divergent/passive Margin Basins, AAPG Memoir 48: Tulsa, American Association of Petroleum Geologists, P. 239-248. Lateral variations in reservoir thickness are the result of growth faults and porosity slowly increases with depth due to the young age of the sediment. = Petroleum generation and migration = Studies to date have set the top of the present-day oil window of the Niger Delta at the 240 ¬∞F isotherm. n the northwestern portion of the Niger Delta, which is where the Delta Field is location, the oil window lies in the upper Akata Formation and the lower Agbada Formation. At different areas in the delta, the oil and gas window depth varies as a result of differing thermal gradients and is dependent on the gross distribution of sand and shale. The Benin Formation has the lowest thermal gradient (1.3 to 1.8 ¬∞C/100 m) followed by the Agbada Formation (2.7 ¬∞C/100 m) and finally the over-pressured Akata Formation (5.5 ¬∞C/100 m).Ejedawe, J.E., Coker, S.J.L., Lambert-Aikhionbare, D.O., Alofe, K.B., and Adoh,F.O., 1984, Evolution of oil-generative window and oil and gas occurrence in Tertiary Niger Delta Basin: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, v. 68, p. 1744-1751. However, sand/shale distribution is not the only controlling factor on oil window depth; temperature, time and deformation due to tectonic events also influence temperature at depth.  Drilling  Location of the major faults and well locations within the Delta Field (Modified after Owoyemi and Willis, 2006).As of 2013, 37 wells (14 vertical and 23 deviated) have been drilled in the Delta Field, most of which are drilled to the base of the Agbada formation. 12 of the wells are in the eastern fault block with the other 25 being located in the western fault block. All of the wells have targeted the middle Agbada formation, where the structural prospect was found. Prior to 2000, 53 distinct reservoirs had been discovered in the Delta Field.

It was announced on January 3, 1968, 3 years before the IBM System/360 Model 22, as a \\"bridge between its old and new computing systems\\". History At a time when lower priced alternatives, such as service bureaus - by 1968, there were 32 such service bureaus serving the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) alone \\\\- and prior generation systems, such as the Honeywell 200, a competitor to IBM's own IBM 1401, were available, this model provided a stop- gap measure. Both the Model 25 and the Model 22, which had been marketed as entry level systems, were withdrawn on the same day, October 7, 1977. Models The Model 25 can be configured with 16K, 24K, 32K, or 48K of core memory. Characteristics The base Model 25 implements the System/360 standard and commercial instruction sets. The scientific or universal instruction sets are optional features. The Model 25 logic is built on IBM SLT modules mounted on pluggable cards, which are plugged into printed circuit boards. The boards are mounted on hinged metal gates, and are interconnected by flat cables. The Model 25 is the first IBM system to store its microcode in a rewritable memory, called the control storage. The control storage uses an additional 16 K (16,384) bytes of core memory. There is also a small part of the core storage that is used to store the contents of registers accessible by software, as well as data used by the microcode. The Model 25 also has a 64-byte high-speed (180 ns) SLT Local Storage, used by the microcode. =Standard Features= *Commercial instruction set *Attachment for 1052 Printer-Keyboard Model 7 =Optional Features= *Scientific or universal instruction set *Byte multiplexer channel or selector channel (one of either) *Storage protection *Direct control (with external interrupt) or external interrupt (alone) *Timer (line-frequency type) *IBM 1401/1460 compatibility *1401/1440/1460 DOS compatibility *1440 compatibility *System/360 Model 20 mode *CPU-integrated attachments for: ::One 1403 Prnter Model 2 or 7 ::As many as four 2311 Disk Storage Drives Model 1 (with file scan feature) ::One 2540 Card Read Punch Model 1 (with column binary feature and punch feed read control) ::One 2560 Multi-function Card Machine Model A1 (for Model 20 mode; also for System/360 mode [read/punch only] if the 2540 emulation feature ::CPU-integrated communications attachment ::One 2314 High Speed Channel - this feature was a RPQ, and was not part of the original announcement =Integrated Attachments= The Model 25 has a standard attachment for connection of a 1052 Model 7 console printer-keyboard, which is used as the operator console. Optionally, the Model 25 can have a standard System/360 I/O channel, that can be either a byte-multiplexor or a selector channel. For the most commonly used peripherals, such as a 2540 or 2560 card reader-punch, a 1403 printer, or 2311 or 2314 disk drives, optional internal attachments are provided. These attachments connect directly to their respective peripherals, and appear to the operating system as if the peripherals were channel- attached. Most unusual about the 360/25 was a feature somewhat analogous to the IBM System/360 Model 44's integrated single disk storage drive, namely an integrated attachment. =Compatibility Features= The Model 25 provides an optional compatibility feature that helps users of IBM 1400 series computers migrate to System/360. With the additional Compatibility Feature hardware and Compatibility Support software under DOS/360, the IBM 1401/1440/1460 object programs can be run in the emulation mode, with little or no reprogramming. System configuration The standard set of peripherals is available, although by this time customers had found their way to IBM-compatible alternatives. A typical System/360 Model 25 configuration consists of: *IBM 2025 CPU *IBM 1052 console printer-keyboard *IBM 2540 card reader-punch *IBM 1403 printer *One or more IBM 2311 or IBM 2314 disk drives *One or more magnetic tape drives, either IBM 2415 or IBM 2401 model 1, attached to the selector channel Software The typical operating system for the Model 25 was DOS/360, which was loaded from disk. Less common was TOS/360, which was loaded from tape, and, rarely, BOS/360, which was loaded from punched cards. Programming was mostly in the COBOL, RPG and Assembler languages for the commercial applications that were the predominant uses of this computer, but Fortran IV and could also be used for the scientific and engineering applications, and PL/I was available.

One of the main types of pollution is an excess of nitrate (NO^-_3) caused by chemical wastes from power plants and agricultural runoffs. The watershed covers about 40% of the lower 48 states, with 7 of the 10 top agricultural producing states being within this watershed.  Nitrogen cycle  This is a table that identifies the processes of the nitrogen cycle with their corresponding chemical reactions. Nitrogen undergoes the nitrogen cycle, where it is converted into different forms (i.e nitrogen (N_2), nitrate(NO_3^-), and ammonia (NH_3)) through various processes, such as fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. Nitrogen‚Äôs impact on the environment is not solely determined on its form within the nitrogen cycle, but the overall concentration of each form. Negative effects on the environment can be observed when these different forms of nitrogen are in excess. The Environmental Protection Agency has set a maximum of 10 mg/L nitrate concentration in drinking and surface waters. When nitrogen in the form of nitrate is in excess, it can lead to a dead zone. A dead zone is a body of water that has a depleted oxygen concentration that is low and can lead to the suffocation of animals. An example of this is the dead zone located off the coast of the Mississippi River. According to NOAA, the 2016 predicted size of this dead zone is going to be approximately 5,898 square miles with a nitrate concentration of 146,000 metric tons of nitrate flowing down the Mississippi and Atchafalaya River into the Gulf of Mexico. Nitrate concentrations have increased significantly (by factors of 2 to greater than 5) since the early 1900s. This is due to the agricultural runoff from the farming states that are released into the Mississippi River. More than half (52%) of the nitrogen concentration comes from soybeans and corn.  Concentration of nitrate  Proper investigation of nitrite concentration changes and effects requires accurate quantification of nitrite levels The Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) method is used to estimate the concentration. The following equation provides the estimate: \\\\ln(c)=\\\\beta_0+\\\\beta_1t+\\\\beta_2ln(Q)+\\\\beta_3sin(2\\\\pi t)+\\\\beta_4cos(2\\\\pi t)+\\\\varepsilon (1) where c is the nitrate concentration, \\\\beta_0, \\\\beta_1.\\\\beta_2, \\\\beta_3, and \\\\beta_4 are fitted coefficients, t is time, Q is mean daily streamflow, and \\\\varepsilon is the unexpected variability from other sources. This calibration curve is generated every day and compared to the one for the previous day. An issue found with this is that the discharge changes day by day. This variation of discharge can increase the concentration one day, and the next day, there could be a decrease in it. This can make it problematic to observe the trends in the concentrations.  Trends  Land use practices in the Mississippi River Basin have significantly decreased the amount of available nitrogen in the soil. This nitrogen is usually in the form of nitrate. The nitrate seeps through the soil and gets into the ground water through agricultural practices such as tile drainage, which eventually makes its way into the surface waters. Nitrate concentration can be dangerous passed a certain level. The water in the Des Moines River is near the maximum legal level of nitrate concentrations for drinking water, and the EPA has declared much of the fish in the river unsafe to eat. Nitrate concentration estimations were made from 1980 to 2010 at a site of the Mississippi River above the Old River Outflow Channel, which is also known as the Old River Control Structure. Its purpose is to flow the water from the Mississippi River into the Atchafalaya Basin in order to prevent the Mississippi River from changing course.This study shows that from 1980 to 2010, the nitrate concentrations remained constant; however, there was a 12% increase in the concentration from 2000 to 2010. The sources of this nitrogen are unknown and the reasons as to why nitrate is increasing in some areas of the Mississippi River Basin while decreasing in others is still a mystery. However, nitrate concentrations were higher during the fall and winter months as opposed to the spring and summer months. This general increasing trend is what leads scientists to believe the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico at the mouth of the Mississippi River is growing. Drainage from crop fields has caused nitrate to leach into groundwater, which has adversely affected some drinking water sources in the Mississippi River Basin. In surface waters, high nitrate levels have led to instances of eutrophication, which have caused dissolved oxygen levels to significantly decrease in affected water bodies including the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Furthermore, altered nitrate to silicate ratios have caused coastal marine ecosystems to move away from a diatom based system to a less productive system.  Remediation  A possible way to lower the concentrations of nitrate is to rebuild landscapes. Grass and catch crop buffers and forest buffers are successful at preventing a buildup of excess nitrate. Any increase in vegetation leads to a decrease in the nitrate concentration, due to its uptake into the plant. The wetlands are the natural barrier to this, but they are being rapidly destroyed. The best way to prevent the dead zone is to remediate and rebuild the wetlands off the coast of Louisiana. In order for at least 40% of nitrate concentrations to be removed, 22,000 square kilometers of wetlands have to be rebuilt. This proves to be difficult because that would require 65 times the amount of wetland restorations that has happened over the past 10 years. Changing agricultural practices could help solve the nitrate problem as well. Strip-till farming and the use of Winter Cover crops have the effect of minimizing nitrate leaching.

Wazir Ali's uprising resulted in his imprisonment for the remainder of his life. Background Oudh State, the Kingdom of Oudh, or Awadh, was a princely state in the Awadh region of north- central India during the British Raj, occupying the plain of the Ganges and immediately south and west of Nepal. Its capital was Lucknow, one of the richest of the northern Indian cities. The British Resident in Lucknow, up until July 1796, was George Frederick Cherry; the role of the Resident was to gather intelligence and, to the extent possible, shape events such that they favoured the interests of the East India Company. Cherry excelled as a spy- master and was inevitably associated with, or interested in, the intrigues of the Nawab's court and state, to the extent that he was withdrawn to Benares in 1796 for his own safety having made sufficient enemies locally. Sir John Shore, Governor-General of India By September 1797, when Oudh's ruler, Asaf- ud-Daula, died, it was a vassal state to the British in the form of the East India Company, which more directly controlled all Indian territory surrounding Oudh. The British, under the Governor-Generalship of Sir John Shore, felt themselves 'compelled' to take a hand in the succession, the choice appearing to rest between Wazir Ali Khan, the adopted son of Asaf-ud-Daula, or his uncle, Saadat Ali Khan II, half-brother of Asaf-ud-Daula and lineal descendant of Shuja-ud-Daula, the Nawab preceding Asaf-ud-Daula. Initially satisfying themselves that Wazir Ali was the heir apparent, the British selected him as Nawab; but quickly came to regret their decision when it became plain that the 17-year old Ali did not intend to co-operate with British wishes. Notably, he demoted and isolated Zehseen Ali Khan, a minister who under Asaf-ud-Daula was identified as being sympathetic to the British; and he acted in a threatening fashion when Shore visited Lucknow. Conveniently, within the first months of his reign, Almas Ali Khan, perhaps the second ranking individual in Oudh came forwards making allegations against Wazir Ali Khan; that there was something improper about his adoption - his mother having been bought by Asaf-ud-Daula - and that he was profligate and calculated to ruin the country. Almas Ali expressed apprehension - presumably to John Lumsden, Cherry's replacement - lest the Governor-General hear all of the details of Wazir Ali's conduct, and suggested that British troops, allied with the Begum, Asaf-ud-Daula's mother, would be sufficient to depose Wazir Ali. The British considered the matter an found that as both Almas Ali Khan and the Begum admitted the spurious claim of Wazir Ali, there could be 'no shadow of a pretext for objecting to the claim of Saadat Ali Khan on the grounds of right. The East India Company concluded a treaty with Saadat Ali Khan - probably on very uneven terms, Saadat being in no position to negotiate terms - under which he would be elevated. On 21 January 1798 Saadat Ali Khan entered Lucknow with the Governor-General and an escort of British troops, where he was invested as Nawab by the Begum - under considerable duress from the Governor-General, who made it clear that if she refused, she would be undermined by him choosing another to perform the role. With little support from the court, which looked largely to the begum, and the antipathy of the British, it was clear to Wazir Ali that he lacked the means to resist, and so entered into an agreement to take a pension of a lac and a half, and retire to Benares, a town on the southern border of Oudh. Wazir Ali's insurrection Wazir Ali Khan The wisdom of requiring the deposed Wazir Ali to reside 'in the hallway of his own country' was called into question from the outset. The young Ali was far from satisfied with his lot, and indications before 1799, and evidence of later enquiries suggests he was plotting against the British and with a view to regaining his lost position. Nevertheless, it took until January 1799 before the British determined to require him to move to Calcutta. It fell to George Cherry, now resident at Benares, to manage Ali throughout 1798 and, when the Calcutta decision was made, to communicate it to him. Ali appears to have been informed of his fate in the early part of January 1799, and his all of remonstrances fell on the deaf ears of the British, in the form of Cherry. Appearing to acquiesce to the situation, he gave it out that he would relocate on the 15 or 16 January. On 13 January Cherry was informed that Ali would visit him the following morning, and on the 14th Ali appeared at breakfast time, leading a more-or-less normal 200-strong entourage. Cherry escorted Khan and three supporters into his house, where Ali took the opportunity to complain loudly about his lot, to assert promises broken by the British, and to blame Cherry for failing to look after his interests. Then, in what looked like a choreographed movement, an associate, Waris Ali, restrained the sitting Cherry from behind his seat, Wazir Ali Khan struck Cherry with his sword, and Cherry was further struck by others of Ali's party. Cherry managed to struggle out of the house, but was quickly killed. Two of Cherry's colleagues were also killed: his secretary, Mr. Evans, was stabbed, escaped outside, and was shot whilst seeking to flee; Captain Conway, who resided with Cherry, arrived at the property and was killed by Wazir Ali's attendants. Wazir Ali's supporters attacking Samuel Davis's house Wazir Ali and entourage next sought to attack the Magistrate of Lucknow, Samuel Davis; on their way they came across a civilian, the unfortunate Mr. Robert Graham, and cut him to pieces. Davis got brief warning of the imminent danger when Ali's followers opened fire on Davis's sentries, and managed to get his family up onto the terraced roof of his property, which was reached from a narrow staircase ascending through the ceiling. He had not time to gather weapons beyond a pike, but over the course of 90 minutes managed to fend off attempts by Ali's followers to gain access to the roof by judicious jabbing of anyone getting within a pike's-length. Wazir Ali appears within this timescale to have decided to move on to the centre of Benares, and Davis's house was eventually cleared by members of his Indian police force together with sepoys. As news of events spread, the European population of the town hid themselves away as best they could, but Wazir Ali and supporters had little time to make mischief - though they managed to kill a Mr. Hill, a European shop-keeper, and set fire to a number of properties - before a Cavalry detachment under General Erskine arrived in the town at about 11am. Ali, with supporters, retired towards his fortified house, not before the loss of one of Erskine's troopers, who falling from his horse was hacked to death. Further immediate annoyance from Ali was curtailed by the arrival of infantry troops, although his men wounded a number of soldiers before falling back to the shelter of the garden his house, which was promptly besieged by Erskine's soldiers. Some further casualties arose as troops sought to regain control of the town, including the deaths of two of Erskine's orderlies. Erskine now brought field artillery to bear on Ali's house, demolishing a defensive tower and doing other damage; but during the night of the 14‚Äì15 January, Ali, most of his horsemen and a number of foot soldiers escaped to the north. He spent the best part of a year hiding in forests on the slopes of the first rank of Himalayas to the north-east of Oudh, and unsettling the Gorakhpur area of Oudh. Ali's situation was bleak, not least his inability to forage sufficient resources to maintain his supporters, who faded away. Towards the end of the year he sought refuge with Pratap Singh of Jaipur, Rajah of Jaipur, who turned him over to the British authorities on condition Ali was not executed nor fettered. Ali was imprisoned for the remainder of his life. Papers relating to the Massacre of Benares are held in the National Archives.

After he retired from the military, Merafhe became Botswana's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Vice-President of Botswana from 2008 to 2012. The organization's responsibility covers the same broad umbrella of Athletics events as the world governing body, the IAAF, with the goal of athletes competing on the international stage.http://www.bnsc.co.bw/bnsc-sports.php?sports_name=14# The current president is Moses Bantsi. Botswana athletes have found success in long sprinting and middle distance events; Nijel Amos won the first Olympic medal as a junior athlete, finishing with a silver medal in the 800 metres at the 2012 Olympics behind David Rudisha's world record.

It is developing a vehicle \\"platooning\\" system to enable pairs of trucks to operate at close following distances with a stated goal of improving safety and fuel efficiency. Peloton Technology was the first company to test a non- research commercial truck platooning system on public roads in the United States. In 2016 it publicly stated it would be the first company to offer a commercial platooning system for use by truck fleets in 2017. By mid-2018 that deadline had slipped to \\"by the end of 2018.\\"  About  Peloton Technology was founded in 2011 by CEO Josh Switkes with co-founders Dave Lyons, Chris Gerdes, and Stephen Boyd with the goal of commercializing vehicle platooning for commercial heavy-duty trucks.  Platooning System  Peloton Technology uses 5.9 GHz DSRC to establish Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications between pairs of trucks. Combined with commercially available radar-based forward collision avoidance systems on each truck, this allows two trucks to operate with a shorter minimum safe following distance. The result is that trucks are able to platoon, improving aerodynamics to reduce fuel consumption. This implementation of these technologies together for the purpose of maintaining a constant gap between vehicles is sometimes referred to as Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control. Peloton's system includes connection of each individual truck to a cloud-based monitoring and management system, which they refer to as the Network Operations Center (NOC). The NOC is designed to monitor individual truck safety and geofence the use of the platooning system by approving the linking of pairs of trucks in specific order only on suitable roads under appropriate weather, vehicle and traffic conditions. Peloton's version of truck platooning operates at SAE Automation Level 1, where drivers in both vehicles continue to steer while the following driver's acceleration and braking is automated to immediately mimic the actions of the leading truck.  Testing  Peloton's platooning system has reportedly been tested over approximately 15,000 miles in several states, including Nevada, Texas, Utah, Michigan, and California. Unique from government and university-funded research projects, Peloton's system is the only commercial platooning system to have been tested on public roads with the intention of deploying to fleets. CEO Josh Switkes has stated that the platooning system will be commercially available in 2017. A 2013 test of Peloton's system held on I-80 in Utah and validated by the North American Council for Freight Efficiency following the industry standard SAE J1321 Type II fuel consumption test procedure found fuel savings of 10% in the following truck and 4.5% in the lead truck at 64 miles per hour with a 36-foot following distance. In 2014, the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory conducted testing of Peloton's platooning system following the SAE J1321 Type II fuel consumption test procedure at the Continental Tire Uvalde Proving Grounds in Uvalde, TX using various truck weights and following distances. The tests found combined savings of 6.4% at 55 mph with a 30-foot gap using 65,000 lb GVW tractor trailers. Combined savings of better than 5% were found to persist at a gap of 75 feet.  Funding  In April 2015, Peloton closed a $16 million Series A round led by Denso International America and Intel Capital, which also included Magna International, Castrol innoVentures, Volvo Group Venture Capital, UPS Strategic Enterprise Fund, Sand Hill Angels, Band of Angels, and Birchmere Ventures. Peloton has since announced additional funding by Nokia Growth Partners and Lockheed Martin. Board of directors Peloton's Board of Directors includes former Corporate Vice President of Research & Development for General Motors Larry Burns; former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater; Former Trimble CTO Ralph Eschenbach of Sand Hill Angels; Mark Lydon of Intel Capital, and Ken Arnold of Band of Angels.  Government Research and Technology Deployment Projects  Peloton is engaged in several state and federally funded research projects related to truck platooning. The company is a partner in a Federal Highway Administration-funded ‚ÄúPartial Automation for Truck Platooning‚Äù project led by Auburn University that includes the American Transportation Research Institute, Meritor WABCO, and Peterbilt Trucks. Peloton also contributes to a second FHWA-funded platooning research project led by UC Berkeley PATH and including Volvo Trucks. Peloton is a partner in the US Department of Transportation-funded Smart City Challenge project awarded to Columbus, OH in July 2016. The California Energy Commission granted the San Diego Port Tenants Association a $5.9 million grant in July 2016 to fund 10 zero-emissions freight vehicles, which includes Peloton Technology as a technology subcontractor. Peloton is also involved with NEXTCAR (Next- Generation Energy Technologies for Connected and Automated On-Road Vehicles), a Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E)-sponsored project that aims to develop technologies that will utilize emerging connectivity infrastructure. A Purdue University-led team of NEXTCAR researchers are focusing on technologies that benefit line-haul Class 8 trucks with an emphasis on platooning vehicles.

She was one of the first female doctors in the state. She, as well as her mother Mary Neosho Williams, purchased a number of tracts of land in the Evergreen, Colorado area, at least some of which were ultimately donated for the Evergreen Conference District. Douglas was the daughter of Civil War General Thomas Williams and wife of Canon Charles Winfred Douglas, a plainsong musical expert and Episcopalian priest. Early life Mary Neosho Williams (d. 1914), widow of Civil War General Thomas Williams, and later instrumental in the development of the Evergreen Conference District, after having established \\"Camp Neosho\\" and what would become the Hiwan Homestead Museum. Douglas was born Mary Josepha Williams in Virginia, the daughter of Civil War General Thomas Williams and Mary Neosho Bailey Williams. Her parents were a wealthy family from Detroit, Michigan. Her brothers were John R. Williams and Gershom Mott Williams, the first bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Marquette who later published General Williams' personal papers. Douglas was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution; she was the great-granddaughter of Captain Gershom Mott who was a commander at New Windsor and Fort Constitution during the Revolutionary War. Education Douglas, under the name Josepha Williams, graduated in 1889 from the Gross Medical College, which was rolled into the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine in 1911. Career After obtaining her M.D., Douglas practiced medicine in Denver beginning in 1889. She was among the state's first female physicians. Douglas and Dr. Madeline Marquette founded the Marquette-Williams Sanitarium, a medical and surgical center, at 1542 Pearl Street in Denver in 1891. In 1892 they established a nursing school in conjunction with the sanitarium. Douglas was superintendent of the sanitarium. Douglas became a member of the Colorado Medical Society in 1894. Evergreen St. John's Episcopal Church in the Evergreen Conference District Douglas purchased several hundred acres of land in Evergreen in 1893 near the cabin of her maternal uncle, Dr. Thomas Bailey. She had a one-room cabin with a \\"massive\\" stone fireplace built for her by John Spence from a partially finished barn. After the cabin was constructed, Douglas and her mother commissioned Spence to build a large addition that included a two-story tower with a servant's kitchen, library, second-story bedroom, and several porches. After Mary Williams death in 1914, it was further expanded upon by Douglas and her husband. It ultimately grew through Spence's efforts to a 17-room lodge with vaulted ceilings, two octagonal towers and a private chapel used by Canon Charles Winfield Douglas. The summer retreat called Camp Neosho also had a number of tents were installed with wood-burning stoves, platform floors made of wood, and double canvas walls by Mary Williams. Visitors included Williams' siblings and their families. The lodge is now the Hiwan Homestead Museum. Williams began holding Episcopal church services in tents in 1893. She purchased Stewart Hotel, which was transformed into St. Mark's in the Wilderness church, later Mission of the Transfiguration. Douglas also purchased land around the Evergreen area and received the former Stewart Hotel through her mother's will. Land and buildings were donated for the creation of the Evergreen Conference District. Personal life The Mission of the Holy Redeemer was established in 1893 in a vacated church building at Lawrence and 10th Street, with the authorization of Bishop John F. Spalding of Cathedral of St. John in the Wilderness. The new congregation included African-American Episcopalians and White Anglo- Catholics. Douglas, her mother and church clergy and leaders met with African- American leaders from Kansas City, Kansas and people who moved to Denver from Memphis, Tennessee. In January 1894, its first church services were conducted. Douglas sailed for Europe in January 1896 for a four-month vacation in Genoa, Italy with Dr. Marquette Baker. Dr. Douglas married Canon Charles Winfred Douglas at the Cathedral of St. John in the Wilderness on July 22, 1896. In 1894, Canon Charles Winfred Douglas had moved to Evergreen from New York to recuperate from pneumonia and tuberculosis and subsequently was under the care of Dr. Douglas. The couple moved to Evergreen after they had married. Canon Douglas began attending Evergreen's summer retreats and music camps in 1897. He led musical events, which increased the popularity of the center. Douglas was priest of the retreat's church, the Mission of the Transfiguration, for more than 40 years. Their son, Frederic Huntington Douglas was born in Evergreen in 1897. He was later a Native Arts curator at the Denver Art Museum. The family moved to New York in 1902 while Canon Douglas pursued in musical and religious career, having the previous year studied plainsong and Gregorian chants in England, France, Germany, and Scotland. He became ill again in 1903 and stayed in a number of eastern convalescent centers before traveling to New Mexico for a six-month stay. In 1918, he edited the New Hymnal of the Episcopal church and in 1940 helped create The Hymnal of 1940. Dr. Douglas died on March 9, 1938 in Evergreen after a long illness. Canon Douglas married Anne Woodward in 1940, with whom he worked with on The Hymnal of 1940, and died on January 28, 1944. See also * Denver public health advocates  Dr. Frederick J.

It is not significantly expressed in many tissues and cell types, though HHIPL1 mRNA has been detected in trabecular bone cells. Little is known about the precise biological function of HHIPL1, but the protein has been linked to adenomas. The HHIPL1 gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.  Structure  = Gene = The HHIPL1 gene resides on chromosome 14 at the band 14q32 and contains 13 exons. This gene produces 2 isoforms through alternative splicing. = Protein = This protein belongs to the HHIP family and is one of three members found in humans. HHIPL1 contains a SRCR domain and an N-terminal signal peptide. Processing of the signal peptide leads to this protein's secretion. As an HHIP member, it also contains a conserved HHIP-homologous (HIPH) domain composed of 18 cysteine residues.  Function  The function of HHIPL1 is not known. The section below refers to the function of HHIP. The function of HHIP is not well known but has been shown to be tightly associated with lung function. Knocking out HHIP in mice is neonatally lethal due to defective branching in the lung. The heterozygous knockout of HHIP has been shown to contribute to more severe emphysema induced by cigarette smoke compared to wild type mice. Furthermore, increased spontaneous emphysema and oxidative stress levels have been found in the lungs of HHIP heterozygous mice. Both the expression level and enhancer activity of HHIP is reduced in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lungs, suggesting a protective role of HHIP in COPD pathogenesis.  Clinical significance  DNA methylation is one of several epigenetic modifications recognized as hallmarks of tumorigenesis. In a genome-wide survey of subtype- specific epigenomic changes in adenoma, the HHIPL1 gene was hypermethylated in 12 of 13 non-functioning (NF) adenomas, as well as in growth hormone (GH)- and prolectin-secreting adenomas. Thus, HHIPL1 has the potential to serve as a biomarker to predict or characterise tumorous growth patterns. Unlike another member of the human HHIP gene family, HHIP, which is regarded as a pharmacogenomics target in the fields of oncology and vascular medicine, HHIPL1 has yet been reported with such potential. Additionally, in the cardiovascular field, HHIPL1 has been associated with CAD in Europeans, South Asians, and a population of Japanese. However, in another study based on a Japanese population, the association failed to be replicated, suggesting that this association is population-specific. = Clinical marker = A multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the HHIFL1 gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).

Although Nicaragua's health outcomes have improved over the past few decades with the efficient utilization of resources relative to other Central American nations, it still confronts challenges responding to its population's diverse healthcare needs.Angel-Urdinola D., Cortez R., Tanabe K. (2008). Equity, Access to Health Care Services and Expenditures on Health in Nicaragua. Health, Nutrition and Population of the World Bank. The Nicaraguan government guarantees universal free health care for its citizens.Sequeira M., Espinoza H., Amador J. J., Domingo G., Quintanilla M., and de los Santos T. (2011). The Nicaraguan Health System. PATH. However, limitations of current delivery models and unequal distribution of resources and medical personnel contribute to the persistent lack of quality care in more remote areas of Nicaragua, especially among rural communities in the Central and Atlantic region. To respond to the dynamic needs of localities, the government has adopted a decentralized model that emphasizes community-based preventative and primary medical care. Healthcare system = History =  Before the 1979 Sandinista Revolution  Before the 1979 Sandinista Revolution, the Nicaraguan health system consisted of four distinct agencies and independent health ministry offices in each province. There was little coordination amongst these institutions, and this system was fraught with provincial differences in salaries, administrative procedures, and more. During this 1970s period, Nicaragua had one of the worst life expectancies at birth and one of the highest levels of infant mortality in the regional area. Both of these measures have improved markedly up to 2016, average life expectancy now reaching 74.5 years.Golladay, F. (1980). Health sector policy paper. World Bank.http://data.worldbank.org/country/nicaragua There also existed an unequal distribution of health resources. Only 25% of the total health budget was controlled by the Ministry of Health, and 90% of the services went to 10% of the population.Braveman, P. et. al. (1985). Primary health care takes root in Nicaragua. World Health Forum. 6, 369‚Äì372. Even though only a quarter of the population lived in the capital city of Managua, health professionals were disproportionately concentrated there. In 1972, half of all Nicaraguan doctors and more than two-thirds of nurses worked in Managua.Holland B., Davis J., Syncrisis, G. (1972). The Dynamics of Health, #9: Nicaragua. U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare. DHEW Pub. No. 74-50007.  Post-revolution  After the 1979 Revolution, the new government established a new Unified National Health System that instated the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health (MINSA) at the head of health services throughout the nation. This system also integrated the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (INSS) under MINSA's direction in order to make it financially feasible to provide a single national health service available to all Nicaraguan citizens, regardless of socioeconomic background. With the combination of these institutions, the INSS hospitals and clinics, previously only accessible to insured employees, then opened their doors to the larger population. In 1984, in order to improve existing institutional infrastructure, 10% of the national budget was allocated to the health sector. From 1979 to 1984, the government also successfully pushed for the construction of 309 new primary healthcare facilities and the training of over 3,000 health professionals. Following the wake of the Revolution, MINSA promoted several prevention-based health efforts, one of the earliest being its Brigadista program. This Brigadista program involved the training of community health advocates, the majority of whom were chosen from the Sandinista Youth Organization, who were selected to be trained and transported to serve in underserved rural regions.Amador, C. (1980). Informe de la Situacion de Salud de Nicaragua. MINSA. Since the 1990s the Nicaraguan government has been changing towards more market-oriented economic policies that have affected the health sector. This healthcare shift has involved increased private sector activity as well as the decentralization of public services. = Levels = The current Nicaraguan public health system follows a decentralized model. This model consists of three distinct administrative levels, each associated with different health services. Levels include (1) the central level, (2) the SILAIS (Local Systems of Comprehensive Care) level, and (3) the municipal level. The Nicaragua Ministry of Health (MINSA) directs the central level and is committed to ensuring universal access to free health services. This decentralized model involves annual contracts between MINSA and local hospitals and health centers that are negotiated to set upcoming specific actions, goals, and funding allocation. The contract system is incentive based, and the amount of federal funding decided upon involves the consideration of institutional performance. As part of the public sector, the revenue generated from hospitals, healthcare centers, and SILAIS are consolidated and calculated by the Ministry of Finance before redistribution of certain percentages to the original institutions.329x329px  Model of Family and Community Health (MOSAFC)  With the intention of maintaining decentralization while expanding citizens' access to quality healthcare, the Nicaraguan government implemented a structural framework model entitled the Conceptual Model of Family and Community Health (MOSAFC) in 2007. As determined by Nicaragua's General Law of Health (No. 423) the overall aim of MOSAFC is to establish integrated networks of public and private service providers that work together to harbor the responsibility of addressing the health needs of specific populations. The overarching goals of this framework were to offer more efficient delivery of health services, improve patient satisfaction with services, and advance the financial protection of citizen's health.MINSA. (2007). Marco Conceptual del Modelo de Salud Familiar y Comunitario (MOSAFC). MINSA. = Healthcare workers = There is an unequal distribution of healthcare workers throughout Nicaragua's different provinces. Most healthcare workers are located on the Pacific coast region, while there is a huge need for primary health professionals in the cities of Jinotega and Matagalpa, as well as along the Caribbean coast. In the year 2000, while Managua contained 20% of the population, the city continued to harbor around half of the country's entire health care professionals.Nigenda, G. and Machado, M. (2000). From State to market: the Nicaraguan labour market for health personnel, 15(3): 312‚Äì318. This trend can be explained by overall low financial incentives for health care personnel, especially for work in remote areas. The average monthly salary for a general practitioner in Nicaragua under MINSA is $544 USD while that of Honduras is $1,332 USD and that of Panama is $1,025 USD.Juan Roque. (2006). \\"Los salarios en Nicaragua\\". El Observador econ√≥mico. Additionally, although 52% of Nicaraguan doctors are specialized in training, this specialization level fails to meet widespread community needs for primary care. In order to improve the healthcare access of those living in more isolated areas, the public medical schools in Nicaragua require their graduates to perform two years of social service in high-need settings, after which they can opt to work in private institutions. This requirement aligns with MINSA's objective to encourage these graduates to work for the public health sector. Amongst Nicaraguan doctors, there persists a lack of gender diversity. Nicaraguan women are underrepresented in the field of medicine, and within the healthcare field have an unemployment rate that is 3.5 times higher than that of men. Women and children's health 424x424px =Reproductive health= Nicaragua's adolescent fertility rate is one of the highest in Latin America. Around half of women in Nicaragua give birth before the age of 20. Approximately one-quarter of all the births in the country involve adolescent mothers.Blandon L., et. al. Early childbearing in Nicaragua a continuing challenge, In Brief, New York: Guttmacher Institute, 2006, No. 3. Lack of use of contraceptives contributes to this high pregnancy rate. Out of all sexually active female adolescents, only 7% utilize condoms and only 47% use any modern method of contraception. A highly tradition-based culture, a conservative government, and the influence of the Catholic Church have limited contraceptive use.The World Bank. Effective family planning programs. Washington D.C.: World Bank, 1993. Educational promotion of contraception is generally only conducted by nongovernmental agencies or women's groups, and it is popular belief among many that various forms of contraceptive methods are detrimental to one's health. =Cervical cancer= Nicaragua has one of the highest cervical cancer incidence rates in the world and the second highest morbidity rate in Latin America, second only to Haiti. Although screenings are provided through their national public health system, only 35% of women have had a Papanicolaou (PAP) smear test by the age of 35 years. A study showed that even when screenings services are adequate, patient follow-up and treatment after abnormal results is of poor quality. A low-cost early detection alternative to PAP smears used in Nicaragua involves visual inspection of cancerous cervical lesions with acetic acid.

While operating in Chilpancingo-Chilapa as a priest, he was persecuted during anti-Catholicism begun during the Mexican revolution and died a martyr.  Biography  Margarito Flores Garc√≠a was born on February 22, 1899 to Germ√°n Flores and Garc√≠a Merced at Taxco de Alarc√≥n in the Mexican state of Guerrero. From a young age, he was forced to labor in the fields due to help support his poverty-stricken family. At 15 he began studying in the seminary at Chilopie.. Garcia received Holy Orders from Bishop Jos√© Guadalupe Ortiz on April 5, 1924. He celebrated his first mass at his hometown church of Santa Prisca y San Sebastian on April 20, 1924. Initially, he ministered in the Chilopie seminary performing the role of vicar while effectively preventing the expansion of breakaway sects. Soon, the persecution of Catholics intensified. In 1926, President Plutoco El√≠as Calles published a government decree requiring priests to leave parish ministry and live in the cities in order to be monitored by the federal government. Garcia was inspired to stay in the region after the martyrdom of David Uribe Velasco. Velasco chose to minister clandestinely where the church was undergoing intensive attacks and where its people were in the greatest danger. In the same year ‚Äì under the influence of increasing repression ‚Äì the clergy were moved from Chilpancingo to Tecapulco. Garc√≠a continued his studies at the Academia de San Carlos. He was arrested in June of the following year (1927) and imprisoned along with members of the \\"League for the Defense of Religious Liberty\\". After intervention by the family of General Roberto Cruz, he was released. In November, according to a complex request, he was sent to minister as pastor of the parish in the village of Atenango del R√≠o. Prior to Garcia's arrival in the village, local government authorities had already killed every other priest located in the town. Shortly after his arrival in the village, Garc√≠a was arrested and dragged on a rope in front of the general in Tulim√°n. He was shot to death on November 12, 1927 by government forces. Police commissioner Crus Pineda had tried to help the priest, but he was shot and killed by federal authorities at a later date. Investigation into the heroic sanctity of Garcia's life began in his local diocese in 1933 and was completed in 1988. Margarito Flores Garcia's death was the result of hatred for the faith. Garc√≠a was beatified in the Catholic Church by Pope John Paul II on 22 November 1992 at the Vatican in St. Peter's Basilica. He was canonized, along with St. Crist√≥bal Magallanes Jara and companions, on May 21, 2001 in St. Peter's Square by John Paul II. In 1925, the relics of Garc√≠a were moved to a chapel in his home parish of Taxco. Garc√≠a's liturgical memorial is celebrated at the level of a commemoration in dies natalis (12 November).

He emigrated from Great Britain to Australia in 1902 and settled in New South Wales. Trade Commissioner Nesbitt was appointed Australian Trade Commissioner in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1934 and his primary task was to cultivate Australia and New Zealand trade. He managed the trade diversion issue and negotiated a number of sensitive issues of trade diplomacy. New Zealand had for many years imported fresh citrus and pineapples from Australia but, in 1932, it imposed an embargo. This was in part retaliation against the Australian prohibition on the import of New Zealand potatoes that had been in force for several years.

Nesbitt was responsible for continuing the negotiations, and for tackling issues such as New Zealand's duties being higher than the British preferential rate.

He was also the driving force behind the construction of the Lansdowne Road stadium. Lansdowne and Lansdowne Road Dunlop founded the Irish Champion Athletic Club in 1871. After an initial meeting at Trinity College, the Provost of the College banned any further meeting on campus. Dunlop had to find a new home for his sporting endeavours. Writing in 1921, Dunlop stated: \\"I was therefore forced to look for another plot, and after careful consideration chose the present Lansdowne Road one. In conjunction with the late Edward Dillon (my trainer), I took a 69 year lease from the Pembroke Estate, paying a ground rent of ¬£60 per annum, of part only of the premises stretching from the railway to about 60 yards from the Dodder. I laid down a cinder running path of a quarter-mile, laid down the present Lansdowne Tennis Club ground with my own theodolite, started a Lansdowne archery club, a Lansdowne cricket club, and last, but not least, the Lansdowne Rugby Football Club - colours red, black and yellow. On the tennis club grounds the first tennis championship was held long before Fitzwilliam meetings.\\" Dunlop founded Lansdowne Football Club in 1872 and that club has played rugby union ever since at the grounds, being one of the most prominent and successful rugby clubs in Leinster and Ireland. Wanderers Football Club, founded in 1869, joined Lansdowne at the grounds later. The two clubs were tenants since that time, and also use the new Aviva Stadium. Some 300 cartloads of soil from a trench beneath the railway were used to raise the ground, allowing Dunlop to utilise his engineering expertise to create a pitch envied around Ireland. Rugby gradually became the main use of the grounds: the first representative rugby match was an inter provincial fixture between Leinster and Ulster in December 1876, and on 11 March 1878, Lansdowne Road hosted its first international rugby fixture, against England, making it the world's oldest rugby union Test venue. Dunlop charged the IRFU ¬£5 and half of any profits over ¬£50 after expenses. The first victory Ireland had at the ground took place on 5 February 1887, against England. Around this time, the treasurer of the IRFU, Harry Sheppard, acquired the lease from Dunlop and when Sheppard died in 1906, the union paid his estate ¬£200 for the lease.

The focus of the museum is primarily on the regional history of Franklin County, and the importance of trains to the development of small towns. It features history of local Native Americans, local industries, and has accurate recreations of historical rooms. The Old Depot Museum is on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  The Leavenworth, Lawrence, and Galveston (LL&G;) railway was the first railroad in Kansas to be built south of the Union Pacific railroad in Lawrence, Kansas. This railway was 30 miles long and connected Lawrence to Ottawa. It was constructed primarily by Chinese railroad workers from 1867 to 1868. In 1873, the LL&G; railway failed and was sold to the Kansas City, Lawrence, and Southern Kansas Railroad, who constructed a train depot in northern Ottawa in 1888. The depot was designed by George Washburn, and made with limestone from Cowley County. In 1895, the depot was sold to Santa Fe railway, who kept it until railroads fell out of popular use. In 1962, the depot building was donated to the Franklin County Historical Society, who turned the building into a museum the following year. The museum opened on the 4th of July, 1963. The museum received a grant from the ISTEA in 1996, and closed for three years to undergo major renovations. In 2001, a high water marker was placed on the outside of the Depot to commemorate the Great Flood of 1951. The marker stands 9.8 feet (2.99 meters) high, the highest that the water of Marais des Cygnes river reached during the flood.

This exhibit was created by Traub Design associates in 2007, and its creation was made possible through a grant from the Kansas Humanities Council. The exhibit involves an \\"immersive\\" element, in that instead of a traditional visual museum exhibit, visitors go into a dark room and listen to accounts from family members of people murdered in the massacre and people who supported the attack, recorded by voice actors.  Caboose  A caboose from the 1940s stands outside of the museum. It was donated by Ron and Deanna Kimes. The caboose was dedicated on Sunday, April 28, of 2013 in conjunction with an event that focused specifically on the history of Kansas railroad workers. The museum has considered adding a rail car to their outdoor exhibit as well, but are worried that it will be vandalized or damaged. = Temporary exhibits =  Crossings  \\"Crossings: Getting Over, Around, and Through Water in Franklin County\\" is a temporary exhibit at the museum that opened on June 4, 2017 and will run through August 20, 2017. The exhibit explores the relationship that Franklin County has with water, especially the Marais des Cygnes river. A central feature of the exhibit is a 34-foot map of the Marais des Cygnes which encompasses the floor of the exhibit. The exhibit is part of a larger initiative to focus on the relationship between people and water, and was supported by a grant from the Kansas Humanities Council to achieve that goal.  Secret Societies  The Secret Societies exhibit at the Old Depot museum ran from August 14 to November 14 of 2016. The full title of the exhibit was ‚ÄúSecret Societies: The Search for Security, Knowledge and Fellowship in Ottawa and Franklin County.‚Äù The exhibit explored the purposes of various secret societies in Franklin County, although the overarching theme was about Franklin County residents searching for community. Some of the secret societies featured were either secret abolitionist groups, like the Danites created by James Lane, or pro-slavery groups. A less seriously themed group was named the Esoteric and Terrible Order of Pie Eaters, which was a fraternity formed in 1868 in response to the Members of the Grange fraternity, which was more serious and exclusionary, and well known for eating cake. The Old Depot museum claimed that the views of the Pie Eaters fraternity were more far reaching than simply making fun of the Grangers, saying they also ‚Äúhad grand plans of doing away with currency and paying with pieces of glass, banishing all women to New Jersey, and achieving world domination while wearing pie plates around their necks and calling each other by titles like the ‚ÄòGrand Gyrasticutas‚Äô and the ‚ÄòGrand Gabster.‚Äô\\" The museum hosted an event that included many of the Pie Eaters secret initiations, and served several types of pie.  Small-Town Ball  \\"Small-Town Ball: Playing America's Game in Ottawa and Franklin County\\" was an exhibit about local baseball teams in Franklin County. The exhibit included information about school teams, company teams, and competitive traveling teams. Along with the exhibit was a presentation by Phil S. Dixon about Negro Leagues Baseball and the Kansas City Monarchs. The Monarchs played in barnstorm games in Ottawa at least five times. The exhibit also featured a documentary screening of \\"Town Teams: Bigger than Baseball\\" at the local Plaza Cinema movie theatre, which focuses on the importance of small local baseball teams across Kansas.  George P. Washburn  In 2007, the Old Depot Museum had a temporary exhibit featuring George Washburn, the architect who designed the depot. Washburn designed several buildings in Ottawa, Kansas, and the museum hosted a guided tour of his buildings as the exhibit was going on.  Harvey Houses  In 2015, the Old Depot Museum had a special exhibit about Harvey Houses, restaurants that were created along railways by Fred Harvey. The depot in Ottawa never had a Harvey House of its own, but had a Harvey cart that served coffee and sandwiches. This exhibit also paired with the local Plaza movie theatre to show \\"Harvey Girls,\\" a movie starring Judy Garland, about Harvey Houses and the women who worked in them.

She presented one of the first urban plans for Bogot√° and worked on both public and private buildings in Bogot√° throughout her career. Between 1966 and 1988, she served as the Director of the Planning Department of the National University of Colombia and spent a decade documenting the history of the buildings on the campus of the university. Early life Mar√≠a Luz Amorocho Carre√±o was born in 1922 in Bogot√°, Colombia to Ana Luc√≠a Carre√±o Phillips and Marco Amorocho Tulio. Her parents were from Socorro, Santander but had moved to Bogot√° for better opportunities. They were poor, but the family had many books and the children were encouraged to study. Amorocho entered college in 1940 and graduated in 1945, from the School of Architecture at the National University of Colombia as the first woman architect of Colombia. Career In the year that Amorocho graduated, the Ministry of Education founded the Cundinamarca High School of Female Culture () under the direction of Ana Restrepo del Corral. Amorocho was named one of the directors of the school and taught draftsmanship and architecture. In 1946, she published an article, Bogot√° puede ser una ciudad moderna, (Bogot√° can be a modern city) with other Colombian architects, Enrique Garc√≠a, Jos√© J. Angulo, and Carlos Mart√≠nez, director of the magazine PROA Arquitectura, which caused a sensation. In the article, as Amorocho advocated for Bogot√° to modernize based on an urban plan and suggested designs to modify the city. The illustrated article showed how the plazas could be redesigned to provide hygienic apartment housing with green spaces and wide streets and included a management plan for obtaining financing for the construction. After La Violencia began in 1948, Luz began working for the Ministry of Public Works in Tumaco reconstructing buildings destroyed in the rioting. For two years, she built schools and office buildings and then went to work at the firm of Cu√©llar Serrano and G√≥mez for a decade. The firm, which included partners Gabriel Serrano Camargo, Camilo Cuellar Tamayo and Jos√© G√≥mez Pinz√≥n, was known for designing some of the most important buildings in Bogot√°, including many hospitals, the Jockey Club, and several businesses. While she was with them, Amorocho worked on designs and construction for the Hotel Tequendama. In the 1960s, Amorocho moved to Paris to study and worked with the architect Nicole Sonolet. When she returned from Paris, in 1966, Amorocho began working as the head of the Division of Physics and Planning at the National University. She coordinated a cross-cultural relationship between her friends in France and co-workers in Colombia. She developed construction projects for public spaces, including buildings, gardens, open spaces, parks, and roads. In the 1970s, Amorocho began a project that took her more than a decade to complete, documenting the design, construction and all details of the history of each building on the campus of the National University.

NightCry is directed and written by Clock Tower series creator Hifumi Kono, and is considered a spiritual successor to the series. It was first released for Windows in March 2016, and later for the PlayStation Vita in January 2019. Ports for Android and iOS were also planned, but never released. Development The game was directed by Hifumi Kono as a spiritual successor to the Clock Tower series. Kono notes that the female protagonist of NightCry is louder and more confident than the female protagonist from Clock Tower. He cites the differences as a result of his changing perception of women, who he no longer idealises as docile and ladylike. Kono collaborated with film director Takashi Shimizu on the project, who directed a 12 minute short film to promote the game. Originally intended to be released for Android and iOS, the game took to crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to raise funds for a PC version in January 2015. The campaign was successful, raising 314,771 in February 2015. The Windows version was released on 29 March 2016, while a PlayStation Vita port was released in North America on 31 January 2019.  Plot  NightCry largely takes place on the Oceanus, an ocean liner attacked by an evil creature called the Scissor Walker. There are three chapters to the game with a different controllable character in each. In Chapter 1, Monica is the main character, a lady being set up for a date on the cruise. In Chapter 2, the main character is Leonard, a professor who explores a nearby ruin guarded by cultists. In Chapter 3, the main character is Rooney, a morose girl also on the Oceanus attempting to escape the Scissor Walker and discover the truth behind the attack.  Reception  Western critical reception to NightCry was mixed. Caitlin Cooke of Destructoid gave the game a 2 out of 10, saying that she could not \\"recommend anyone play NightCry unless you have a steel resolve, unlimited time on your hands, and a penchant for terrible physics and animations straight out of the PS2 era\\". In contrast, L. Harvard of Digitally Downloaded gave the game a 4.5 out of 5, saying \\"an authentic Clock Tower-style, classic stalker horror experience for the modern day. The ambition and the unique vision of NightCry genuinely make me excited that there is a future in traditional gameplay\\".

She was destroyed in action in 1799 with the loss of all but two of her crew. Career The Navy commissioned Trincomalee under the command of Commander John Rowe. An Arab Dow arrived at Bombay on 6 December 1799, from Muscat. She brought information from Mr. Manesty, the British East India Company's (EIC) Resident at Bassorah. He reported that Trincomalee had been dispatched from Muscat to intercept two French ships in the Gulf of Persia that had captured Mr. Manesty's ship Pearl,Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p. 143. on 7 October.Parkinson (1954), pp.162-3. Pearl had been carrying three lakh rupees (750,000 francs), 40 horses, 5000 \\"saumons de cuivre\\", and other cargo. In the engagement on 7 October in which Iphig√©nie captured Pearl, Captain Fowler of Pearl and five of her crew were killed, and a number of men wounded before she struck. Her captor then removed the bullion and cargo from Pearl, and then decided to sail for Mauritius. Trincomalee set out in company with the Bombay Marine's cruizer Comet. They were cruising in the Bab-el-Mandeb when just before midnight on 12 October they encountered two vessels, the French privateer Iphig√©nie, Captain Jean-Fran√ßois Malroux du Bac, and her prize, Pearl. Trincomalee challenged them, but they did not respond and instead sailed away. The next morning the two British ships spotted them and gave chase, catching up with their quarry. An action ensued at about 11a.m. with Trincomalee engaging Iphig√©nie and Comet engaging Pearl. The exchange of fire lasted about two hours when suddenly Trincomalee exploded. She was so close to Iphig√©nie that the explosion knocked down Iphig√©nies main and mizzen masts and ruptured her sides, with the result that she soon started to founder. Comet and Pearl broke off their engagement and picked up the few survivors. There were about 30-40 survivors from Iphig√©nie; Malroux du Bac drowned, apparently while trying to retrieve documents aboard his ship. Pearls original crew had also been on board Iphig√©nie. Only two men from Trincomalee, a seaman and a lascar, survived. Pearl and Comet did not renew their engagement, instead sailing off in different directions, Pearl with the survivors from Iphig√©nie. Comet landed the two men from Trincomalee at Muscat. Pearl arrived at Muscat on 15 October to replenish her water. There the captain of Pearls prize crew freed John Carmlington, an officer from Pearl who had survived despite being on Iphig√©nie, on 24 October, the day Pearl sailed.

Retired young to stud following a racing injury as a two-year-old, Malibu Moon has since sired multiple grade I stakes winners, two Eclipse Award winners, and is the sire of Orb, winner of the 2013 Kentucky Derby.  Background Bred in Kentucky by B. Wayne Hughes, Malibu Moon is a bay sired by A.P. Indy out of the Mr. Prospector mare Macoumba. Macoumba was a grade I winner in France, winning the Prix Marcel Boussac, before she was imported to the United States by B. Wayne Hughes.

The locals are thinking of erecting one new, in a more decent and more venerable form. About sixty years later, such project was approved by the Curia of Novara.

The outer floral tepals are oblanceolate, with shorter inner tepals that are emarginate (notched at the apex) and taper towards their base with green patches apically and basally (see illustrations). The fruit forms a dehiscent capsule that forms three valves. Overall G. elwesii is a more robust plant than G. nivalis.  Taxonomy  G. elwesii was identified by the British botanist Henry John Elwes on a visit to Turkey in 1874. In early April, whilst in the mountains near Smyrna (modern Izmir), he came across \\"the fine large snowdrop which now bears my name\\". It was then formally described by Joseph Dalton Hooker (1875) and named G. elwesii, with an illustration by W H Fitch in Curtis's Botanical Magazine, and thus the species bears his name as the botanical authority. Later the plants collected by Elwes were found to actually be G. gracilis but the name was retained for a different specimen. = Etymology = The species is named in honour of Henry John Elwes.  Distribution  A native of the Caucasus, the species has been widely introduced.  Cultivation  G. elwesii is grown as an ornamental plant in gardens where they easily naturalise. Bulbs planted in the autumn flower in the early spring. Propagation is by separation of bulbils after flowering. In the UK, the following have received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. *Galanthus elwesii *Galanthus elwesii 'Comet' *Galanthus elwesii var. monostictus  References   Bibliography  *  * see Enciclopedia Argentina de Agricultura y Jardiner√≠a   *  External links  Category:Amaryllidoideae ","title":"Galanthus elwesii"},{"id":"51891409","text":"thumb San Leonardo is a Roman Catholic parish church in a rural site in the frazione of Tapigliano, in the town limits of Nebbiuno, province of Novara, Piedmont, Italy.

The dedication and the layout, with a fa√ßade facing east, suggest an early foundation, perhaps around the 10th century. Documents from the 13th century appear to refer to this church.

It was released on October 11, 2016. The book follows the titular character, Adelina Amouteru, after her takeover of the kingdom that once hated her. Background Asked about how she felt about the book, Lu stated that she felt like a \\"parent... watching their kid go off to college,\\" claiming that although she felt sad to \\"leave\\" Adelina at the end of the book, she was \\"not proud of her.\\" She additionally stated that the book follows Adelina \\"discovering what she really wants\\". Plot Adelina Amouteru has achieved her goal of defeating all that have ever opposed her, but must side with her former enemies in order to defeat a threat greater than all of them. After becoming Queen of Kenettra, Adelina gets a letter from Rafael stating that her sister, Violetta, is dying. After Adelina attacked Violetta, she found sanctuary with the Daggers. Adelina attacks the country in which she believes Violetta is in. Adelina's fury takes control of her and she is unable to think clearly which results in her and her soldiers capture. During the capture, Adelina begs to see Magiano, whom she loves. Later on, she is presented to a court in which Rafael, Enzo and other members of the Daggers are. Because many elites have godlike powers, they are unable to contain their powers and it eventually will kill them. They make a deal with Adelina in which she and the Roses travel to the portal of the gods to return their powers. The gods have also had a negative effect on the environment such as sea animals being beached. Adelina later agrees but secretly only because she can be near her dying sister. Enzo attempts to kill Adelina under the influence of the Goddess of Death, Moritas. Luckily, Rafael kills Enzo while Enzo whispers the name of his dead beloved. Rafael saves Adelina and later cries over Enzo's dead body. Each elite that was going on the journey connects with a certain god; The Beldish Queen, Maeve Corrigan and Teren Santoro are the only ones to connect with Moritas and Tristius, Angel of War. Much to Adelina's disgust, Maeve and Teren are brought on the journey. During the journey, Adelina confesses her love for Magiano and for the first time in a long time, Adelina is able to sleep without the voices in her head talking. As the elites get closer to the portal, their powers and the negative effects of their powers increase. This results in Violetta's death. Everyone mourns the death of Violetta but continues on the journey. After reaching the portal, Maeve's men wait outside the portal for the elites' return. The elites enter the portal and meet monsters that feed on their godlike powers. Teren dies protecting others from the monsters and Adelina cries even though she hates him. All go and meet Moritas and bargain with her and return their powers. Adelina meets the Moritas and sees the dead body of Violetta and begins to cry. Moritas states that for one to come back to live, another life must be taken. Adelina cries and apologizes to Magiano for leaving him and trades her life for her sister because if Violetta were in the same situation, she would have traded her life for Adelina's. Violetta is transported back to the entrance of the portal in which she cries and explains what happened. Maeve's men greeted their Queen and says she has been gone to the portal for two months. Violetta apologizes to Magiano who in return says that it was Adelina's choice. A couple months later Violetta begs the Goddess of Empathy, Compasia, to give her sister back. Compasia apologizes to Moritas and makes Adelina into a star just like Compasia did to her human lover. Magiano follows Adelina's constellation and in the book it states: If you are very quiet and do not look away, you may see the brightest star in the constellation glow steadily brighter. It brightens until it overwhelms every other star in the sky, brightens until it seems to touch the ground, and then the glow is gone, and in its place is a girl. Her hair and lashes are painted a shifting silver, and a scar crosses one side of her face. She is dressed in Sealand silk and a necklace of sapphire . Some say that, once upon a time, she had a prince, a father, a society of friends. Others say that she was once a wicked queen, a worker of illusions, a girl who brought darkness across the lands. Stilll others say that she once had a sister, and that she loved her dearly. Perhaps all of these are true. She walks to the boy, tilts her head up at him, and smiles. He bends down to kiss her. Then he helps her onto the horse, and she rides away with him to a faraway place, until they can no longer be seen. These are only rumors, of course, and make little more than a story to tell round a fire. But it is told. And thus they live on. The folktale is said to be Magiano and Adelina although, it has not been confirmed. Promotion To promote the book, Lu went on a book signing tour. It began on October 11, the release date of the book, and ended on October 25, 2016.

For 16 years, the team dominated the senior baseball circuit in Ontario. Background Baseball has a long history in Milton, particularly in Campbellville, Ontario where it had its beginnings with the Lumberman's Baseball Club as early as 1872. It really flourished as a community tradition in the 1920s and 1930s, but was interrupted with the outbreak of World War II. In 1950, a team of local boys formed a juvenile team that competed in the Halton County League in the 1950 and 1951 seasons. As several boys were about to go over juvenile age for the 1952 season, and on account of half a dozen local players already playing in the Intermediate League for Milton or Waterdown, it was decided to enter Campbellville into this top competition. In the 1950s and 60s, the Campbellville Intermediate Baseball Team won numerous county and provincial titles in a 16-year span from 1952 to 1968. A grandstand and club house was erected in 1960 in Campbellville to make room for the 2,000 spectators that would descend on the hamlet. In 1953, the Campbellville Baseball Club won the OBA Intermediate C Championship in just its second year in the league, before repeating again and again. Managed by Len Andrews, and known as the Merchants, the men's Campbellville baseball team won 11 consecutive Halton county league titles, as well as 12 Ontario Championship titles between 1952-1967, an amazing feat for a hamlet of 300 at the time. Notable Records During this 16-year era, the team had a winning percentage of .771 and picked up championship titles all over Ontario. During the same period in the Ontario Baseball Association playoffs, the team won 85 of 108 games (.787 winning percentage). Within the years of 1959-64, the team's peak, Campbellville went 175-36-5 (.829 winning percentage). Jim Vipond, sports editor of the national newspaper the Globe and Mail, wrote in one of his columns: \\"Hats off to Campbellville's championship baseball teams.\\" When the club repeated as Ontario Intermediate C champions in 1954, it marked the first time this had been accomplished since the creation of the \\"C\\" classification in 1934. Manager Len Andrews served as a lieutenant in the Canadian Army overseas during the Second World War with the 22nd Canadian Regiment (Canadian Grenadier Guards). He received several awards for his amateur baseball work including from the Premier of Ontario and the Ontario Baseball Association of which he was past president and a life member. Notable alumni * Stan Henderson, .369 average over 450 games * Jack Roberts, pitcher with record of 180-46 in 16 years (.796 winning percentage) and an ERA of 1.89. In the 1966 final, he pitched two consecutive no hitters and did not walk a batter in 18 consecutive innings. * Al Wingrove, .382 average over 417 games Legacy As a result of the strong baseball traditions established by the intermediate team, other Campbellville baseball teams won four more provincial titles between 1968 and 1984. The Old Campbellville Baseball Park remains one of Canada's oldest baseball parks. It was significantly reworked prior to the 1953 season. The team is considered one of the greatest amateur sports teams in the history of Ontario.

To date, those efforts have been unsuccessful. However, the intermediate men's squad (1952-67 era) was inducted into the Baseball Ontario Hall of Fame in 2014. In 2016, the Milton Sports Hall of Fame inducted the Campbellville Intermediate Baseball Team inducted as its first ever honoured team.

Begun in 1764, when M√©n√©tra returned from a journeyman's tour of the French provinces, M√©n√©tra's text intersperses accounts of his life on the road and in Paris with tall tales, braggadocio, jokes, and accounts of his seductions and pranks. In the words of historian Robert Darnton, M√©n√©tra's narrative \\"restores the human dimension to the study of social conditions and brings flesh and blood to lifeless sociological categories. What we can finally see, with the help of these memoirs, is ordinary, everyday life.\\" Overview The provenance of the manuscript of M√©n√©tra's Journal is unknown, according to scholar William Reddy. The manuscript was found in the Biblioth√®que historique de la ville de Paris, having been donated by a book collector at an unknown date. M√©n√©tra made no attempt to publish the Journal during his life. Reddy goes on to describe the work: > At first the manuscript appears to be nothing but a catalogue of barroom > tales arranged in chronological order. M√©n√©tra speaks in order to impress > the way people do in bars: as if to say \\"Wait till you hear what happened to > me!\\" He tells of his fights with his father, his workplace accidents, his > run-ins with highwaymen, his amorous adventures with maidservants and > masters' wives, and above all his glorious activities as member of the > secret journeymen's brotherhood, Les Compagnons du Devoir. The tales succeed > one another without any attempt to develop specific themes or organize an > argument or explore particular issues, dilemmas, or problems. There is no > tension or plot. M√©n√©tra's style is highly elliptical, often to the point of > obscurity. Yet the cumulative effect is nonetheless powerful. As one > ridiculous or self-glorifying story succeeds another, the reader begins to > discern the clear outlines of a personality and the shape of an individual > life. Critical commentary Historian Leslie Choquette wrote of M√©n√©tra: \\"He is, to my mind, the prototypical Frenchman of the eighteenth century.\\" David Hopkin hailed M√©n√©tra's Journal as \\"one of few unforced personal testimonies we have from a member of the French popular classes of the eighteenth century.\\" Hopkin explained the motifs of the memoir: > Long before he was a writer M√©n√©tra was, as Robert Darnton argues in his > preface to the English edition of the Journal, a storyteller. His memoirs > include occasions on which he entertained his colleagues and acquaintances > with spicy anecdotes of his amorous exploits. His nickname among his fellow > journeymen,'the welcome Parisian', is indicative of the enhanced status such > narrative talent earned him in this world of youthful male sociability. But > M√©n√©tra was also a teller of stories in the colloquial sense of the term, in > that he was frequently 'economical with the truth'. To construct his memoirs > he drew on a fund of popular motifs concerning social bandits, prodigal > sons, nubile nuns and bawdy matrons, some of which he acquired from the > cheap street literature of the time, but much of which also belonged to oral > popular culture. It is unlikely that M√©n√©tra only had recourse to these > motifs in his written work; they were already part of his storytelling > repertoire (or as Darnton puts it, his Journal is an extension of his 'bull > sessions'). We can reasonably deduce from M√©n√©tra's example that the > communicative processes of the early modern artisan included recognizable > genres of what folklorists call 'oral literature', such as folktales, > legends, jokes and proverbs. William Reddy reviewed M√©n√©tra's Journal in The Journal of Modern History: > On the whole, given the inherent importance of the document and the > excellent, thorough annotation and analysis provided by Roche, this book > represents an invaluable package for anyone working on eighteenth-century > social history. It is a lovely companion piece to Roche's own recently > published Le peuple de Paris (Paris, 1981) and a marvelous addition to the > list of nineteenth-century working-class memoirs and writings that have > recently been republished (one thinks of Martin Nadaud, Louise Michel, Denis > Poulot, Agricole Perdiguier). The laboring poor, once thought to be silent, > are beginning to speak to us with their own mellifluous voices. Roger Chartier points out that M√©n√©tra's text has helped establish that people of humble social status owned books that were not aimed at them. Lisa Jane Graham, writing in The Journal of Modern History, describes M√©n√©tra's Journal as an example of \\"low Enlightenment\\" culture, an example of how \\"[t]he Enlightenment clearly strayed beyond glittering portals into much shabbier abodes.\\" Raymond Birn, writing in Eighteenth-Century Studies, points out the importance of M√©n√©tra's Journal as a historical document: > [B]eneath the surface of M√©n√©tra's consciousness, a theme does appear to > prevail. It is the struggle for liberty‚Äîthe liberty to work or not work, to > select companions and friends irrespective of conventional social > restraints, to make love as one sees fit, to choose between social > integration and dissociation. Working against M√©n√©tra's quest are political > and economic realities beyond his control; personal conflicts with his > father, wife, and children; and, of course, the biological fact of physical > decline. The tension of a complete life provides the drama for M√©n√©tra's > story. It may not be high tragedy, but it isn't farce either. The story is a > precious social and personal document, and M√©n√©tra's is a rare voice among > the silent majority of the past, the unveiling of whose universe has been > the most significant accomplishment of historians of our generation.

Within the communications platoon, there are four sections: Data, Wire, Radio, and Maintenance. Each of these sections have specialized individuals who have been trained to best understand their field.  Leadership  The communications platoon is headed by a 2nd or 1st lieutenant, called the Communications Officer or S-6, and a master sergeant, called the Communications Chief. For regiment level communication platoons, it's typical to have a captain head the platoon and a master gunnery sergeant be the senior enlisted marine.

The rank of the section chief can vary from sergeant to master sergeant; however, to have a Data Chief, Radio Chief, Wire Chief, or Maintenance Chief MOS, the marine must be a staff Non-commissioned officer (NCO). Organizational structure of the USMC Communications Platoon  Data section  Key objectives of the data section are to develop and prepare networks during field operations, maintain the network at the base, and provide helpdesk support. The data section is responsible for all computer related issues for the battalion, to include email, office support, servers, switches, routers, and printers. During preparation of field ops, the data section will configure routers and switches to create a LAN at the base of the field op. Additionally, the data section will prepare all laptops that will be used and the servers to support them (e.g. exchange servers, ESXi hosts, etc.).  Radio section  Within the communications platoon, a section of 15 to 30 Radio operators provide Command and Control (C2) for the commanders and subordinate units. This ultimately leads to clear and concise information passage between units by way of two way radio communication. During operational situations such as field training exercises and deployments, the establishment and operation of radio networks is accomplished. A typical radio network has a central hub located at the battalions Combat Operations Center. For purposes of anti radio direction finding, all radio systems and antennas are remotely moved away from the battalion Combat Operations Center, leaving only the operators with an interface behind. This central hub allows exterior units to communicate with battalion assets. With this system established Indirect Fire Agencies, casualty evacuation, resupply and many other vital services can be accomplished. Enabling systems include satellite communications systems and high frequency radios for long range communication, ultra high frequency radios for air communication and very high frequency radios for tactical ground communication. Additionally, networks can have further extended ranges by establishing a repeater site known as a retransmission site. This allows a larger sphere of influence for the battalion commander and his staff and subordinate commanders.

Couch was a side-wheel driven steamboat that operated on the Columbia and lower Willamette rivers from 1863 to 1873. Informally the vessel was known as the Couch. Construction John H. Couch was built at Westport, Oregon in 1863. The boat was named after a prominent seaman, John H. Couch, who was also Oregon‚Äôs first inspector of hulls. The boat was built by Capt. Charles Holman, D. Huntington, and Capt. Oliff Olsen (1836-1920). Holman owned one-half of the boat, with the others holding a one-third and a one-sixth share, respectively. The shipbuilder was John Bruce, of Astoria. Design, dimensions, and engineering John H. Couch was a side-wheel driven vessel. It was built to run from Portland to Astoria, Oregon. The official merchant vessel registry number was 13622. John H. Couch was long, with a beam of , exclusive of the guards and the paddle-wheel housings. Gross tonnage was 255.24 tons. The engines had cylinders with an inside bore of 14 and three- eighths inches with a stroke of 54 inches. Operations Advertisement for John H. Couch, November 10, 1866. John H. Couch operated for a time in opposition to the dominant steamboat concern on the river, the Oregon Steam Navigation Company. O.S.N was running the steamer Julia against the Couch on the Astoria route. In January 1865, O.S.N. bought the Couch, as well as the steamers Cowlitz (ex Swan) and Belle, which were also owned by Holman, Huntington, and Olsen. Once O.S.N. had the Couch, it withdrew Julia from the Astoria route. O.S.N. kept the Couch on the Astoria run under Capt. J.O. Van Bergen, as master, with Richard Hoyt, Jr. as purser. During summer, the boat was sometimes engaged in excursion business. Van Bergen was succeed in command by Capt. Henry A. Snow, who remained in charge until 1870. In November 1866, the Couch had a contract to carry the U.S. mail from Portland to Astoria. Captain Snow was then in command. Couch left Portland for Astoria and way landings at 6:00 a.m. on Mondays and Fridays of each week. Returning, Couch departed Astoria on Tuesdays and Saturdays at 6:00 a.m. Captain Grenville Reed was also reported to have been in command of the John H. Couch for five years. Disposition By 1870, Couch was no longer fit to carry passengers and was retired from service. In January 1873, Couch was dismantled, with the boat‚Äôs engines being salvaged and sent to the upper Columbia, to be installed on another steamer.

It was published by Currency Press in October 2016. The play 'follows the story of Theodora Sprout, a perpetually defensive, cynical and uptight twenty-something desperate to escape her wild parents.' It was first performed by Accidental Productions at the Bakehouse Theatre, Adelaide, South Australia. Wallace (Robbie Greenwell) and Anni (Maya Aleksandra) Original production Cast Steph Clapp as Theordora Sprout, the central character, 'two parts Daria, one part Olive Penderghast. Glasses. Gingham. Feisty attitude.' Maya Aleksandra as Anesidora Sprout, 'Theo's more vibrant, self-assured twin.' This character has been linked dramaturgically to Jung and the concept of the shadow self, as she may represent that which Theo suppresses in her own nature. Josephine Pugh as Barbara Sprout, Theo's mother. 'Conservative clothing. Excessive Blush. Generous smile. Her comments are layered with subtext.' Brendan Cooney as Jasper Sprout, a 'washed-up ex-singer'. He frequently argues with Theo as he is desperate to be seen as 'extraordinary' while Theo wants an ordinary life. Alec S. Hall as Chad Mombardo, a self-help guru who preys on Jasper. He carries a storm with him and threatens to tear Theo's world apart. He has been compared to the titular character in Tartuffe. Robbie Greenwell as Wallace Bobbottom, Theo's boyfriend, a wannabe politician. He trolls right-wring chat rooms and believes he is partly responsible for the Liberal Party leadership spill. Nomakhosi Mpala as Imani Fisseha Azikiwe aka Figsby, Wallace's best friend. She often flirts with Theo to make Wallace uncomfortable. Mikayla Lynch as Sasha Flint, Wallace's campaign manager. She is on a nicotine comedown and often beats Wallace with her lollipop. 300x300px Crew *Director: Joh Hartog *Set and Costume Designers: Kirsty Martinsen, Alison Stamke,Casey van Sebille *Sound and Lighting Designer: Stephen Dean *Stage Manager: Lauren Taylor Critical reception The original production received strong reviews. Fran Edwards wrote that \\"Alex Vickery-Howe has written a fun piece of theatre with lots of laughs, but it does have a couple of serious messages. The attempt to be ‚Äònormal‚Äô is often an expression of the need to be different and sometimes conformity is a bigger demon than difference.' while Jamie Wright praised 'Director Joh Hartog and his cast ‚Äì particularly Steph Clapp as Theo [and] Robbie Greenwell as Wallace' for 'an excellent job in bringing Vickery-Howe‚Äôs great dialogue to life; it‚Äôs fast- paced but never rushed, and all whip out witty comebacks and zingers with perfect comic timing.' 270x270px Wallace (Robbie Greenwell) In her review, Georgina Tselekidis captures the thematic content of the play: > As the story progresses, it‚Äôs easy to see this correlation between the > characters and our own self-ego. Jasper continues to search for ‚Äòmore‚Äô as he > feels destined for greatness, something that his family cannot provide him. > Always looking to his past and to a time when he was a successful rock god, > his life feels ‚Äòordinary‚Äô now. From following one spiritual conquest to the > next, nothing is fulfilling his creative desires, or feeding his ego. He > wants approval and self-satisfaction, but don‚Äôt we all? It‚Äôs something we > are undoubtedly left to ponder throughout Out of the Ordinary.' She adds that 'director Joh Hartog and playwright Alex Vickery-Howe transform a simple context into an ‚Äòout of the ordinary‚Äô interpretation' and that the 'actors were strong and dominant, stealing the show in each of their scenes.'  Style  Like its predecessor, the play experiments with hyperreality by juxtaposing everyday relationships with 'sudden fantasy sequences, musical numbers, cartoonish projections and exaggerated sound effects.' Ivanova (2016) notes the strong influence of manga and anime. Academic framework The published play contains an introduction by Maggie Ivanova entitled The Art of Life: Aesthetic Engagements with the Everyday where she discusses the themes in detail, including 'the impulse in contemporary culture to amplify our experiences, no matter how mundane, in order to heighten their emotional intensity and make them worthy of dramatic replay - whether through personal reminiscences, tweets or Facebook posts'. She describes the antagonist, Chad, as a 'Dostoevskian anti-hero' who 'is increasingly harder to like as the play progresses but we simply cannot dismiss what he has to say'. 320x320px Ivanova frames the relationship between Theo and her unborn daughter Anni as 'hyperreal' resulting from a 'hybrid, multimodal meaning-making relationship between the verbal, the visual and the ambiguous (spiritual, irrational or plain bizarre and inexplicable). A world similar to those we see in comics and manga, which are dramaturgically evoked here, creates a primary reality that serves as a meeting point for separate expressive and experiential planes - Theo and Anni, thought and emotion, word and image, here and elsewhere.' She compares these magical aspects of the play to the works of Lewis Carroll and Haruki Murakami. In his writer's notes, Vickery-Howe cites What Good Are the Arts? by John Carey as his thematic inspiration.

The property was named after the English explorer who, in 1579, narrowly missed discovering San Francisco Bay and instead sailed the Golden Hind into Drakes Bay 28 miles north. Built in 1928 by Midwestern hotel developers Leon W. Huckins and John A. Newcomb for the then princely sum of $5 million, the hotel was run by several major hotel companies before being purchased by an investment partnership led by Bill Kimpton, founder of Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants, in 1994. Kimpton sold the property in 2005, but still manages the historic hotel. In addition to its Union Square location, the Drake is known for its opulent, Renaissance-style interiors, Italian restaurant, Scala's Bistro, and as the location of a 21st story nightclub that has been a city attraction for decades, The Starlight Room. History Opened on October 23, 1928, the Sir Francis Drake Hotel attracted a crowd of 10,000 people during a two-day open house as well as officials such as San Francisco Mayor Jimmy Rolph, Jr. and California Governor, C. C. Young. Orchestras played and banquets were held to celebrate what headlines at the time described as ‚ÄúThe last word in hotels‚Äù for innovations and amenities such as an indoor golf course, ice water on tap, and radios in every guest room. Another feature was the Servidor, a panel in the guest room doors which allowed staff to deliver dry cleaning and other items without disturbing guests. It‚Äôs rumored the primary purpose was actually so room attendants could discretely serve liquor bottles to guests during Prohibition. After the stock market crash in 1929, the hotel still prospered, attracting Hollywood luminaries such as Dolores del R√≠o, Myrna Loy, Barbara Stanwyck and the ‚ÄúOur Gang‚Äù child actors as well as dance troupes and vaudeville players. Prohibition was repealed in 1933 and by 1936, the hotel served its first cocktails, prices at 35 cents. That same year, the hotel opened the Parisian Room, a supper club on the street level that became a popular San Francisco nightspot featuring dancing, dramatic lighting and murals painted by A.B. Heinsbergen. Legendary San Francisco columnist Herb Caen dubbed the Persian Room ‚ÄúThe Snake Pit‚Äù because, he said, ‚ÄúYou never heard such hissing or saw such writhing.\\" The Sir Francis Drake was sold to Conrad Hilton in 1938. It was his first hotel outside of Texas.http://biography.yourdictionary.com/conrad-hilton Hilton sold the hotel to industrialist E. B. DeGolia on December 8, 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed, and Western Hotels (later Western International, today Westin) assumed management of the property.http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/42/Westin-Hotels-and- Resorts-Worldwide.html World War II was another important era for the Sir Francis Drake, as blocks of rooms were taken over by the U.S. military and the hotel was the scene of many tearful farewells and joyous reunions as troops made their way to and from the Pacific. During the war and in the post-war era, the Sir Francis Drake Hotel become synonymous with San Francisco]nightlife thanks to the popularity of the Persian Room and Starlight Room (known then as the Starlite Roof), the 21st floor nightclub that featured dining, dancing and orchestras. In 1965, Bewitched star Paul Lynde and James \\"Bing\\" Davidson, a 24-year-old actor, checked into the hotel together. After a few hours of drinking tragedy struck when Davidson accidentally fell to his death from the window of 819. Princess Hotels bought the hotel in 1970https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/82366149/ and assumed management from Western International on December 1, 1970. As the hotel approached its 50th anniversary, an extensive $5 million restoration was undertaken ‚Äì the cost of the original construction. It was begun in 1971 and included uncovering and restoring lobby paintings depicting Drake's explorations and original ironwork and chandeliers that had been covered in several layers of paint. Completed in 1974, the project also revealed and restored the grand marble staircase to its original splendor and reduced the number of rooms from 600 to 386 more ample guestrooms and suites. It was also during this time that famed doorman and local personality Tom Sweeney assumed his post at the Drake‚Äôs entrance in the hotel‚Äôs trademark red Beefeater uniform. He reportedly takes about 500 pictures a day. In subsequent years, the Drake remained a landmark attraction at Union Square but in the late 1980s, the property ran into financial difficulties in a very competitive San Francisco hotel environment. Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants founder Bill Kimpton saved the iconic location in 1993 by forming an investment partnership that purchased the property for $22 million.https://www.thefreelibrary.com/KIMCO+HOTEL+%26+RESTAURANT+MANAGEMENT+CO.+ASSUMES+MANAGEMENT+OF...-a014692829 Another $9 million was invested to renovate the entire building inside and out. Kimpton Hotels sold the property in 2005 to a group of international investors known as SFD Partners, LLC, who in turn sold the hotel in 2010 to Pebblebrook Hotel Trust for $90 million.http://www.hotelnewsnow.com/Articles/6841/Pebblebrook-acquires-Sir- Francis-Drake-Hotel-for-US90m Kimpton continues to manage the hotel.http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Historic-Sir-Francis-Drake-has- new-owner-2625242.php Location The Kimpton Sir Francis Drake Hotel is located in downtown Union Square, San Francisco. The hotel is adjacent to Saks Fifth Avenue's San Francisco flagship store, and the iconic Powell Street cable car passes in front of the hotel. The Kimpton Sir Francis Drake Hotel is also adjacent to the Theatre District and Chinatown, the oldest in North America. Architecture Hotel developers Huckins and Newcomb set out to make the Sir Francis Drake a hotel to impress. Even with exceptional amenities like an indoor golf course, it was ultimately the extravagant interiors that made the hotel famous. Designed to reflect the European Renaissance of Drake‚Äôs era, architectural elements included the grand marble staircase, vaulted gold leafed embossed ceilings and bas-relief detail. Sir Francis Drake Hotel, San Francisco, view of the top It was the job of San Francisco architects and engineers Weeks and Day to evoke this Renaissance splendor. Banquet rooms, restaurants and guestrooms were equally elegant, accented and accessorized with everything from fine Irish linens to Reed & Barton Silver. News accounts of the time described the hotel‚Äôs Persian Room lounge as ‚Äúenveloped in an aura of romance‚Äù accented with midnight blue carpets, black-topped tables inlaid with gold, bronze table lamps with colored lights and a spun glass foundation illuminated by constantly changing lights. The room rate to experience the Drake in these early years started at $3.50 per night. Starlight Room For the past seven decades the 21st floor Starlight Room has remained part of the San Francisco nightlife. The club offers 180-degree city and bay views, and hosted a long-running drag show brunch on Sundays. In 2019 Starlight Room was revamped and renamed Lizzie's Starlight, with a change in management. Sunday Drag Brunch continues at other locations in the hotel. Prohibition Room A Prohibition Room exists just above the elevator lobby and can only be accessed with an elevator stop key. This secret room cannot be found in any of the original blueprints of the hotel as it was built as a way to store bootlegged liquor via Canada from the Moss Beach Distillery that was reportedly given to guests at check-in and through the hotels servidor doors as a way to circumvent the Prohibition laws of the day. If you look closely at the lobby ceiling you can still see the tiny peepholes that were drilled through the floor to keep a lookout for police. If you look closely at the upper lobby ceiling and chandelier you will notice a few peculiar holes in the ceiling. These are said to be from a 1920s wedding when the father of the bride shot off a tommy gun in celebration. Haunted hotel It is rumored that guests have reported windows mysteriously open, curtains moving, eerie voices and strange shadows.

Born in Rockland, Maine to Cora Lounella Buzelle and Henry Tolman Millay, Ellis was one of three sisters who were all, due to their parents‚Äô divorce, largely brought up by their mother. Having been a writer of poetry herself, Cora Millay ensured the presence of art and music in the Millay household, which became a vital part of the upbringing of Ellis and her two sisters. Ellis would go on to perform with the Provincetown Players and appear on Broadway. She married painter and actor Charles Ellis. At the time of her sister Edna St. Vincent Millay‚Äôs death in 1950, Ellis was left as the sole heir to her estate, leaving her to inherit Steepletop, a 650-acre farm in Austerlitz, New York, where Millay had spent the last twenty-five years of her life, as well as rights to all of her creative and intellectual property. In 1973, Ellis would go on to create the Millay Colony for the Arts, right next to Steepletop, as a center for burgeoning artists, offering residency and workshops for them to refine their craft.

Rivalries The race to Mars involves competition between manufacturers and nations. NASA has demurred in a potential rivalry with SpaceX or other manufacturers in any possible race to be first to Mars. It instead sees synergies in possible cooperation with such entities. However, politicians may push NASA into competition with private entities such as Boeing and SpaceX in getting humans to Mars. President Trump has planned for NASA to reach Mars in the 2030s. Boeing has stated that one of its rockets will lead to the first crewed expedition to Mars, before SpaceX or others will land a crewed mission. Boeing is the primary contractor on the U.S. Space Launch System (SLS) NASA rocket program that has the ultimate goal of a crewed Mars mission. SpaceX has declined to state that it is a race, or that it needs to race Boeing. Blue Origin has stated that with its New Armstrong and New Glenn rockets, it may be attempting missions to Mars, head-to-head with SpaceX's Interplanetary Transport System. This may result in commercial competition going to Mars. Virgin Galactic has expressed interest in future service to/on Mars. , SpaceX is developing their own hardware, the Starship with initial launches planned for the early 2020s, followed by a cargo mission to Mars planned for 2022 and a crewed Mars mission in 2024 with the goal of setting up a propellant depot and the beginnings of a Mars base. Inspiration Mars planned a crewed flyby of Mars using third party hardware but has been inactive since 2015.

In 2001, the Chinese State Council officially approved Daweishan as a National Nature Reserve. Daweishan National Nature Reserve crosses Pingbian, Hekou, Mengzi and Gejiu counties with the total area of 439 square kilometer. The elevation of the reserve is varied from 100 meter to 2365 meter. Daweishan has the only humid rainforest in the mainland of China and has a complete tropical mountain forest ecosystem vertical profile. From the bottom to the top, there are tropical humid rainforest, montane rainforest, monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest, mossy evergreen broad-leaved forest and mossy dwarf forest. Daweishan has extremely rich biodiversity which has 12 Grade I National Protected Plants, 23 Grade II National Protected Plants, 12 Grade I National Protected Animals and 46 Grade II National Protected Animals.

Deforesting, ecological degradation, wild species disappearing still happened. However, as the village‚Äôs land did not belong to the reserve and the community did not regulate their activities, there are frequently conflicts between the survival and protection which caused negative impacts to the long term biodiversity conservation. Under the support of UNDP and GEF/SGP, Nature Conservation Association of Pingbian launched the ‚ÄúConstruction of Daweishan ICCA‚Äù project in October 2013. The project was carried out in the 3 villages locating in the core zone of Daweishan reserve, i.e. Malongdi, Ludima and Changpo Village, which has direct and significant impacts on the reserve and its biodiversity. The overall objectives of this project were 1) Raise the 3 project villages‚Äô awareness on protection and enhance their capacity on sustainable development, 2) effectively protect forest and biodiversity through develop sustainable livelihood and clean energy, and 3) register ICCA and develop co-management mechanisms between the communities and reserve administration bureau. Major activities included village conference, training (on biodiversity, beekeeping and product certification, biogas use and clean energy, and ICCA registration), publicity activities, registration of beekeeping cooperative and ICCA, community patrol and biodiversity image monitoring, community protection actions, and biogas construction. Through the first and second village conference, biodiversity and ICCA training, community committee operation, patrol and biodiversity monitoring, the 3 villages‚Äô awareness and capacity on protection were significantly raised. Villagers understand ICCA concept, they agreed to registered ICCA and make protection actions. In September 2014 the 3 villages signed ‚ÄúFree, Prior and Informed Consent‚Äù and complete the registered form/case study together with project team.

His pseudonym ‚ÄúAskr Svarte‚Äù comes from the Old Norse Askr and the adjective Svartr, meaning ‚ÄúBlack Ash Tree‚Äù. Nechkasov is a descendant of German colonists from W√ºrttemberg who settled in the lands of Bessarabia in Moldova and near Odessa, Ukraine in the 19th century. They were exiled to Siberia in the early years of World War II. Ideas and Activity Nechkasov is the founder of the Svarte Aske community of pagans and the editor-in-chief of the Foundations for Traditional Religions, a Russian website which promotes and analyzes news and studies pertaining to paganism. Nechkasov is the author of several books on Pagan Traditionalism and the Left- Hand Path in Odinism in which he polemicizes from a Traditionalist point of view against what he calls Modern and Postmodern influences on contemporary neo-paganism worldwide. Nechkasov‚Äôs works also focus on the reconciliation of Traditionalist and Heideggerian philosophies with pagan theology and worldview. Following Ernst J√ºnger, Martin Heidegger, and Pentti Linkola, the problem of the influence of technology and progress on existential alienation is also a central concern of Nechasov‚Äôs thought. Since 2015, Nechkasov has been the editor-in-chief of the annual Russian Traditionalist almanac Warha. To date, seven issues have been released in Russian and two in English. Nechkasov has been featured as a guest writer in the Russian Slavic neo-pagan magazine Rodnovery (‚ÄúNative Faith‚Äù, Russian: –†–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≤–µ—Ä–∏–µ), the academic journal Colloquium Heptaplomeres established by the Russian scholar of religion Roman Shizhensky from Nizhny Novgorod State Pedagogical University, and in the Ukrainian Traditionalist almanac Tradition and Traditionalism (Russian: –¢—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏—è –∏ –¢—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–º).

Since 2017, Nechkasov has been a featured expert and public speaker on Pagan Traditionalism and the pagan community in the Russian press, TV, conferences, and in the field of religious studies. Nechkasov was a member and head of the local chapter of the Eurasian Youth Union from 2011 to 2013. He is an advocate of folkish and tribal currents in neo-paganism, promotes the appreciation of the plurality of cultures and traditions, and staunchly rejects universalism and globalism.

While the formulation of the test is not without criticism, it is usually accepted as setting out the tests for the implication of a term into a contract. Background =Factual Background= In 1963 BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd as the name suggests a subsidiary of British Petroleum Co Ltd. reached an agreement with Henry Bolte, the then Premier of Victoria for the establishment of an oil refinery and construction of port facilities at Crib Point, in Western Port, Victoria (\\"the Refinery Agreement\\").Westernport (Oil Refinery) Act 1963 (Vic). The Parliament of Victoria, on the same day it ratified the Refinery Agreement, amended the Local Government Act 1958 to allow local councils to agree on the rates payable for industrial land.Local Government (Decentralized Industries) Act 1963 (Vic), inserting section 390A. In 1964 the Shire of Hastings and BP Refinery entered into a Rating Agreement, which set out the rates payable for the following 40 years, and was approved by the Governor (\\"the Rating Agreement\\"). BP decided to restructure its Australian operations and on 15 December 1969 wrote to the Shire of Hastings stating \\"I hope I may assume that there will be no difficulty over transferring\\" the rights and privileges including the Rating Agreement to BP Australia Ltd. That the Rating Agreement would transfer was apparently so obvious to BP that it did not wait to hear the position of the Shire of Hastings before transferring the assets to BP Australia Ltd. Under the Rating Agreement the rates would have been $50,000 however the Shire of Hastings said the Rating Agreement no longer applied and assessed the rates in excess of $150,000. =The first set of appeals= An appeal against the assessment by BP Australia to the County Court was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Supreme Court of Victoria. The Supreme Court held that under the Local Government Act the Shire of Hastings could only validly make an agreement with a particular ratepayer for specified land, and not any person who might subsequently become the ratepayer. While the Rating Agreement applied, if at all, by statutory force, it was regarded by the parties and the court as simply a contract between the parties.. BP could have sought leave to appeal the decision to the High Court of Australia. or to the Privy Council, but did not do so. Instead it took steps for BP Refinery to resume its occupation of the refinery site in September 1973. The Shire of Hastings again assessed the rates as in excess of $150,000. =The decision of the County Court= BP refinery was unsuccessful in its appeal to the County Court, where the judge held: > \\"In the end I have come to the conclusion that not only is this a personal > contract, as the Supreme Court has already decided, but that there was a > fundamental condition of continuing occupancy by the appellant. A reading of > the whole of the agreement leads, in my opinion, to the finding that it > contemplates that [BP Refinery] will continuously occupy the site and > therefore be liable for rates. I am further of the view that the actions of > the parties and the correspondence amounted to an agreement that the > agreement was at an end or, if it did not, [BP Refinery] was in fundamental > breach and the [Shire of Hastings][ rescinded the contract by its letter of > 9 February 1970, inelegantly expressed though it may have been.\\" =The decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria= BP Refinery appealed to the Supreme Court of Victoria. On 5 May 1976, the Full Court dismissed the appeal, holding that #it was an implied condition of the rating agreement that it should continue in operation only so long as BP Refinery should be the occupier of the refinery site and rateable as such; so that on BP Refinery going out of occupation on 1 January 1970, the rating agreement came to an end. #if the agreement had not come to an end by the operation of such an implied term, the letter from BP Refinery and the Shire of Hastings amounted to \\"a mutual acquiescence between the appellant and the Shire that (the rating agreement) was to be treated as discharged.\\"; and #it was unnecessary to determine the third - \\"wider and more difficult\\" - point argued on behalf of the Shire of Hastings - namely, that there had been a repudiation or fundamental breach of the rating agreement by BP Refinery, the rating agreement having allegedly imposed on BP Refinery an obligation to remain in occupation of the site and to maintain, operate and use the refinery for the purpose, inter alia, of enabling the rates to be calculated. The Appeal to the Privy Council =The majority decision= The majority of the Privy Council, Viscount Dilhorne, Lord Simon and Lord Keith, cited with approval a passage from the judgement in Prenn v Simmonds in which Lord Wilberforce said \\"In order for the agreement ... to be understood, it must be placed in its context. The time has long passed when agreements, even those under seal, were isolated from the matrix of facts in which they were set and interpreted purely on internal linguistic considerations.\\"Prenn v. Simmonds [1971] 3 All ER 237; [1971] 1 WLR 1381. > Their Lordships do not think it necessary to review exhaustively the > authorities on the implication of a term in a contract which the parties > have not thought fit to express. In their view, for a term to be implied, > the following conditions (which may overlap) must be satisfied: # it must be > reasonable and equitable; # it must be necessary to give business efficacy > to the contract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is > effective without it; # it must be so obvious that \\"it goes without saying\\"; > # it must be capable of clear expression; # it must not contradict any > express term of the contract. The test for the implications of terms was not controversial, citing three well known cases for its authority * The Moorcock The Moorcock (1889) 14 PD 64 at p. 68. * Reigate v Union Manufacturing Co Reigate v Union Manufacturing Co [1918] 1 KB 592 at p. 605; * Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd [1939] 2 KB 206 at p. 227. In applying these principles, the majority took into account the surrounding circumstances, including that: * the investment by BP was irrevocable in that once the refinery was built, it was not practical to move it. * the Rating Agreement was set within the framework of the Refinery Agreement, not only by implication but also by express reference. * the Refinery Agreement contained provision for assignment within the BP group in Australia. The majority held that the term found by the Supreme Court of Victoria, that the agreement would end once BP Refinery ceased to be liable to pay rates on the property, was not necessary to give business efficacy to the Rating Agreement and that it was wholly unreasonable and inequitable to limit the ability of the BP group to make changes in its corporate structure. The identity of the particular member of the BP group could not have been of the least importance to the Shire of Hastings. Instead they found that an entirely different term, said to make the Rating Agreement accord with the Refinery Agreement to permit the assignment of the rights within the BP group. That the majority found that what was obvious to the County Court, the judges of the Supreme Court and indeed two of their colleagues, was wrong and that those judges had missed what should have been obvious. =The dissenting judgement= Lord Wilberforce and Lord Morris dissented. The difference of opinion was not on the question of principle, but rather on the application of those principles. Their Lordships noted that: * The 1973 decision of the Supreme Court was not the subject of appeal; * BP Australia paid rates on the ordinary basis; * The argument which the majority upheld, was not put forward in either court below and was inconsistent with the decision of the Full Court in the 1973 case concerned with BP Australia Ltd, and involved contending that that unappealed decision was wrong; * The definition of Company adopted by the majority contradicted the definition in the Rating Agreement. Significance The decision has been adopted and applied in numerous decisions, both in Australia and England. =In Australia= *Secured Income Real Estate (Aust) Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Ltd Mason J accepted and applied Lord Simon's formulation, holding that \\"[t]he fact that such a provision would provide a greater protection for the respondent is not a sufficient reason for implying it\\". at p. 605-6 per Mason J. *Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW Implication of a term in fact in a contract, by reference to what is necessary to give it business efficacy, was described as raising issues ‚Äúas to the meaning and effect of the contract‚Äù. Implication is not ‚Äúan orthodox exercise in the interpretation of the language of a contract, that is, assigning a meaning to a particular provision‚Äù. It is nevertheless an ‚Äúexercise in interpretation, though not an orthodox instance‚Äù.. Brennan J also applied the test formulated by Lord Simon. His Honour was circumspect with regards to the application of the test in BP Refinery, holding that if the majority judgment had sought to derive the implication of a term from the matrix of facts in which the contract was made then it did not accord with sound principle.. *Hospital Products Ltd v US Surgical Corporation where Deane J noted that the test formulated by Lord Simon was \\"concerned with the question whether a term should be implied in a formal contract which was complete upon its face and care should be taken to avoid an over-rigid application of the cumulative criteria which they specify to a case such as the present where the contract is oral or partly oral and where the parties have never attempted to reduce it to complete written form.\\". *Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd held that the implication of a term in fact is based upon the presumed or imputed intention of the parties. It is necessary to arrive at some conclusion as to the actual intention of the parties before considering any presumed or imputed intention. That the inclusion of a term of an award as a term of the contract would, if it were breached, support an action for damages by the employee was not a ground for saying that the term was necessary for the reasonable or effective operation of the contract. That is the proposed term went to remedies for breach and not to the question of obligations.. =In England= *Philips Electronique Grand Public SA v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd, Sir Thomas Bingham MR described Lord Simon's formulation as a summary which \\"distil[led] the essence of much learning on implied terms\\" but whose \\"simplicity could be almost misleading\\". Sir Thomas then explained that it was \\"difficult to infer with confidence what the parties must have intended when they have entered into a lengthy and carefully-drafted contract but have omitted to make provision for the matter in issue\\", because \\"it may well be doubtful whether the omission was the result of the parties' oversight or of their deliberate decision\\", or indeed the parties might suspect that \\"they are unlikely to agree on what is to happen in a certain ... eventuality\\" and \\"may well choose to leave the matter uncovered in their contract in the hope that the eventuality will not occur\\".Philips Electronique Grand Public SA v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd [1995] EMLR 472 at p. 481-2 Sir Thomas went on to say this at p 482: > \\"The question of whether a term should be implied, and if so what, almost > inevitably arises after a crisis has been reached in the performance of the > contract. So the court comes to the task of implication with the benefit of > hindsight, and it is tempting for the court then to fashion a term which > will reflect the merits of the situation as they then appear. Tempting, but > wrong. [He then quoted the observations of Scrutton LJ in Reigate, and > continued] [I]t is not enough to show that had the parties foreseen the > eventuality which in fact occurred they would have wished to make provision > for it, unless it can also be shown either that there was only one > contractual solution or that one of several possible solutions would without > doubt have been preferred ...\\" *Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd, a case decided by the Privy Council, Lord Hoffmann said: > 22\\\\. ... ‚Äú[I]t is not enough for a court to consider that the implied term > expresses what it would have been reasonable for the parties to agree to. It > must be satisfied that it is what the contract actually means. ... 27\\\\. The > Board considers that this list [in BP Refinery (Westernport) v Shire of > Hastings] is best regarded, not as series of independent tests which must > each be surmounted, but rather as a collection of different ways in which > judges have tried to express the central idea that the proposed implied term > must spell out what the contract actually means, or in which they have > explained why they did not think that it did so.‚Äù. * Marks and Spencer plc v BNP Paribas Securities Services Trust Company (Jersey) Ltd Lord Neuberger (with whom Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge concurred) questioned whether Lord Simon's first requirement, reasonableness and equitableness, adds anything in that if a term satisfies the other requirements it is likely to be reasonable and equitable. Business necessity and obviousness could be alternatives, although it would be a rare case where only one of those two requirements would be satisfied. Lord Neuberger thought \\"to speak of construing the contract as a whole, including the implied terms, is not helpful, not least because it begs the question as to what construction actually means in this context.\\". =Criticism of the test= The criterion of ‚Äúnecessity‚Äù has been described as ‚Äúelusive‚Äù and \\"somewhat protean\\".A reference to Proteus the shape-shifting old man of the sea from Greek mythology who would change his shape to avoid having to yield a true prophecy.. It has been suggested that ‚Äúthere is much to be said for abandoning‚Äù the concept of necessity.

Tone policing detracts from the validity of a statement by attacking the tone in which it was presented rather than the message itself.https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2019/04/how-tone- policing-legitimizes-injustice-and-private-police The notion of tone policing became widespread in U.S. social activist circles by the mid-2010s. It was widely disseminated in a 2015 comic issued by the Everyday Feminism website. Many activists argued that tone policing was regularly employed against feminist and Black Lives Matter advocates, criticizing the way that they presented their arguments rather than engaging with the arguments themselves. Conceptual development Writing for The Harvard Crimson in 2016, columnist Shubhankar Chhokra noted that the concept of tone policing received widespread online dissemination through a comic created by the website Everyday Feminism the previous year. He added that \\"social activists\\" active at the time were \\"quick\\" to highlight examples of tone policing. =Examples= Tone policing is often aimed at women and may derive from the stereotype that women are more emotional than men and particularly the angry black woman stereotype. In Bailey Poland's book Harassment, Abuse, and Violence Online, she addresses that tone policing is frequently aimed at women and attempts to derail or silence opponents who may be lower on the \\"privilege ladder\\". She identifies tone policing as a form of cybersexism, as it enables men to dominate women in debates by acting as authorities on what approaches were acceptable. The men, by focusing on women's tone, made the outcome of the debate not based on the argument, but rather on the man's use of either \\"respectful\\" interaction or aggressive harassment. In Keith Bybee's How Civility Works, he notes that feminists, Black Lives Matter protesters, and anti-war protesters have been told to \\"calm down and try to be more polite\\". He argues that tone policing is a means to deflect attention from injustice and relocate the problem in the style of the complaint, rather than address the complaint itself.Keith Bybee (2016) How Civility Works, p. 30. Stanford University Press. . In his \\"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\\", Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. condemned this type of silencing, writing that he was \\"gravely disappointed\\" with the \\"white moderate, who is more devoted to ‚Äòorder‚Äô than justice.\\" Criticism While ad hominem fallacies of relevance are often autologies, critics have argued that tone policing is a flawed concept simply because it is autological, meaning calling out tone policing is a form of tone policing. As discussed by The Frisky's Rebecca Vipond Brink, \\"The problem with telling someone that you have a right to express yourself as angrily as you want to without them raising an objection is that you're also inherently telling them that they don't have a right to be angry about the way you're addressing them.\\" Although maintaining that the idea of tone policing had validity, Chhokra argued that those raising objections to tone policing often made the error of not viewing \\"argumentation as the most effective means to resolution\\". He thought that many of those who made accusations of tone policing against others appeared to take the view that \\"discussion can be simply emotional or eschewed altogether for unilateral claims to the truth\\".

She competed in the 2014 Asian Games, where her team won a gold medal. She is a daughter of Chung Yoon-hoi and his ex-wife Choi Soon-sil, who has been arrested amid the 2016 South Korean political scandal for using her friendship with the president Park Geun-hye to illegally interfere in state affairs. Choi solicited business donations from top South Korean firms, including Samsung, for a nonprofit organization that was controlled by her.  Controversy  = Suspicion on the reason of letting her participate in the Incheon Asian Games= Ahn Min-Seok is a member of the New Politics Alliance for Democracy (NAPD) and alleges that favors were exchanged to make sure that Chung Yoo-Ra would participate in the Incheon Asian Games. = Controversy of her receiving preferential treatment at school = Chung Yoo-Ra only attended 86, out of 205, days of class during her third year at the Sunhwa Arts Middle School. Furthermore, she was completely absent for 42 days of class and left early without permission at 46 instances because of her equestrian training and competitions. The school only excused her for 3 absences and 6 instances of tardiness when she was sick. At the time, Song Ki-Seok, an administrator at the School District of Seoul, knew about her absenteeism but did nothing about it. Chungdam High School expelled her for excessive absenteeism, but Choi Soon-sil successfully appealed the expulsion by producing an official letter from the Korean Racing Association. However, on December 5, 2016, the Board of Education of the School District of Seoul revoked her high school diploma. The board further accuses she of bribing her high school teacher for a perfect score at her exit examination and forging her records at an equestrian competition that she never participated in. She allegedly lied about winning a gold medal at the Asian Games during her admission interview for Ewha College (a women's college). (She did win the award.)Professors also allegedly gave her credits that she did not deserve. When suspicions arose, Chung Yoo-Ra suddenly applied online for a leave of absence from the college but ultimately did not complete her application. On December 2, 2016 and after a special investigation, Ewha College's Audit Committee requested the college to expel Chung Yoo-Ra, revoke her admission, and discipline the corrupt professors. On December 5, 2016, she received a letter from the board which revoked her high school diploma and a letter of expulsion from her college but decided to not appeal those decisions. = Related to the K-Sports Foundation = Chung Yoo- Ra allegedly embezzled funds from the K-Sports Foundation, which was used by Choi Soon-Sil to solicit bribes from South Korean conglomerates. Choi also used a number of shell companies to facilitate her crimes. Choi closed these companies on the same day that the Mir Foundation and K-Sports Foundation were in the news for illicit activities. = Arrest by Danish local police = On January 2, 2017, Lee Ga-hyuk, a reporter from the JTBC Newsroom, tracked down Chung Yoo-Ra's Volkswagen, which was parked inside the garage of her Aalborg hideout. A Korean resident in Denmark suspected Chung of illegal immigration and reported her to the local police, who promptly arrested her. = Permanent expulsion from the Korea Equestrian Association = On April 17, 2017, the Korean Racing Association permanently expelled and banned Chung Yoo-ra from both international and domestic competitions because of her admissions scandal. It also ordered her to return the stipend that was paid by the national team. Legal issues During the investigations of the 2016 South Korean political scandal, Ewha College revoked her admission due to \\"preferential treatment in admissions and grading\\". The board of the School District of Seoul also revoked her high school diploma because she falsified her high school records. In December 2016, South Korea put out an arrest warrant for Chung Yoo-ra for charges including obstruction of justice after she refused to return from Germany to attend a parliamentary inquiry about her role in the scandal. The South Korean government announced that it would invalidate her passport and seek her arrest and extradition from Germany. The South Korean government also sought the help of Interpol to track her down. On January 1, 2017, some South Korean journalists managed to tracked her down in Aalborg and tipped the Danish police of her whereabouts, who promptly arrested her. The German Federal Police are investigating Chung Yoo-ra and her mother for money laundering involving assets that are estimated at more than 1 billion US dollars.

Formed in Italy, it participated in the Italian Campaign for the entire duration of its war service. It was implicated in the massacre of 97 civilians in what is known as the Benedicta massacre, which occurred at Piedmont in April 1944. Operational history The 362nd Infantry Division was formed in Italy, in the area around Rimini, during the period from October to November 1943. It was formally established on 15 November under the command of Generalleutnant Heinz Greiner. The division nominally fell within the responsibility of Wehrkreis VII (military district VII), and was centred on F√ºssen. It was a Type 44 division, which meant that it had six battalions of infantry in contrast to the nine of a conventional division, and also had less motorised transport. Its core, including Greiner and his divisional staff, were the remnants of the 268th Infantry Division, which had previously served on the Eastern Front and had recently been disbanded following significant losses incurred in the Battle of Kursk and subsequent retreat. Infantry numbers were boosted with battalions from the 44th, 52nd, 76th and the 305th Infantry Divisions. Its first engagement was in the Battle of Anzio in January 1944 and when the Allies managed to break through the German defences four months later, the division was overrun. Greiner (who had earlier won praise from Manstein for his performance as a regimental commander and staff officer) was just returning from leave when his division was literally overrun by the massive air-supported assault of the U.S. 3rd Infantry and 1st Armored Divisions on May 23 and 24. Allied intelligence reported that the 362nd was \\"destroyed.\\"Thus when the 1st Armored Division began its exploitation of the breakthrough on May 26 through Velletri, in the zone of the 362nd Division, no serious resistance was expected. But in one of the most intensive one-day battles of the war, under Grenier's inspiring leadership, the 362nd not only held, its counterattacks drove the surprised American tsnkmen back to their starting positions. (TN Dupuy, A Genius for WarUSA 1977) Prior to this, the division was involved in the Benedicta massacre, which occurred at Piedmont between 6 and 7 April 1944, where 97 civilians were executed. Withdrawn to Rome, the division suffered heavy losses during the Allied advance and had to be rebuilt. Two of its original grenadier regiments were disbanded and were replaced by the 1059th and 1060th Infantry Regiments, transferred from the recently disestablished 92nd Infantry Division. Returning to the front on the Gothic Line, it manned the frontlines near Florence and later at Bologna. During Operation Grapeshot, the last major engagement mounted by the Allied forces on the Italian Front, the division became surrounded near the Po River by the American forces. It surrendered on 23 April 1945.

The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded annually to those who have \\"done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\\".\\"Nobel Peace Prize\\", The Oxford Dictionary of Twentieth Century World History The announcement was made on 7 October at a press conference at the Nobel Peace Center, and the formal award ceremony took place on 10 December at the Oslo City Hall. The award was conferred only five days after the government's narrow defeat in the Colombian peace agreement referendum to ratify the final agreement on the peace process. The committee Chair Kaci Kullmann Five emphasized the effort and good intentions of Santos at the announcement press conference and also in the award citation: Santos was first informed of the prize by his son in the pre-dawn of the day of the announcement. In his first public statement he declared, This honourable distinction is not for me, it is for all the victims of the conflict. Together we will win the most important prize of all: PEACE. In the days following he also announced that the 8 million SEK prize (approximately 2.7 billion Colombian pesos) would be donated to support victims of the conflict.  Nominations  376 candidates received nominations for this year's prize included 228 individuals and 148 organizations - the largest ever number of nominees, the previous record being 278 in 2014. Notable other nominees included the \\"White Helmets\\" of the Syrian Conflict (who received several editorial endorsements from western newspapers); representative \\"Greek islanders\\", particularly those from Lesbos, for their response to the related refugee crisis; Nadia Murad for her work in refugee advocacy; and Congolese gynaecologist Denis Mukwege for work with victims of rape. Still further nominations included Svetlana Gannushkina, Ernest Moniz and Ali Akbar Salehi, and Edward Snowden. Gannushkina and Syrian Civil Defense had been jointly awarded the 2016 Right Livelihood Award in the weeks prior. Six other Colombians, five of them victims of the Colombian armed conflict, had also been nominated. Reactions In a press release statement, UNESCO Director- General Irina Bokova said that this year's prize \\"pays tribute to the audacity and perseverance of President Santos and all those who seek to build peace every day, step by step to heal the wounds of the country, in their families and communities.\\" Media coverage characterised the announcement as a surprise since the national referendum on October 2 was narrowly defeated. Initial reports also expressed surprise that the prize was not awarded jointly with FARC leader Rodrigo Londo√±o, Santos' main negotiating partner. Londo√±o, under the name Timoleon Jimenez, tweeted his reaction to the announcement: \\"The only award we want is peace with social justice for Colombia without paramilitarism, without retaliation or lies.\\" Syria Civil Defence, tweeting as \\"The White Helmets\\", congratulated Santos and wished for peace for the people of Colombia, An hour later the Twitter account shared an image of a destroyed building with the text \\"At the time of the @NobelPrize announcement, @SyriaCivilDef center targeted in Hama. Back to work.\\" √Ålvaro Uribe, The leader of the movement to oppose the referendum and Santos' predecessor as Colombian president, congratulated him but also stated ‚ÄúI want him to lead to change these democracy-damaging peace accords.‚Äù Ciar√°n Norris, writing in The Guardian, argued that awarding the prize solely to Santos, not to the White Helmets nor shared with a FARC leader, was a deliberate choice to lend its power in a way that might have the greatest direct impact in achieving peace. \\"The Nobel prize committee had an opportunity today, just days after a hard- fought peace risked being lost in the Colombian jungle, to provoke peace and kickstart that process. In so doing, they have demonstrated that where the international community may not always lend its support to securing peace in every conflict ‚Äì Syria chief amongst them ‚Äì they can sometimes provide the necessary momentum to see it through.\\" Committee Five and Nj√∏lstad announcing the winner at the 7 October press conference The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee: * Kaci Kullmann Five (Chair since March 2015, born 1951), former member of Parliament and cabinet minister for the Conservative Party.

It has smooth white to pale grey bark, sometimes with rough bark near the base of the trunk, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, creamy white flowers and cup-shaped, barrel-shaped or cylindrical fruit. Description Corymbia paractia is a tree, often with several stems, that typically grows to a height of , sometimes to , and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth creamy white to pale grey bark that is shed in thin scales, sometimes with thin, rough, flaky brownish bark near the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have hairy, egg-shaped to elliptical leaves that are dull green, long, wide and petiolate. The crown of the tree has both intermediate and adult leaves. Adult leaves are the same shade of dull green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The tree usually loses its leaves in the dry season. The flower buds are arranged in the leaf axils of leafless branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum, sometimes with a small point in its centre. Flowering occurs between April and May or October and December and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a cup-shaped, barrel-shaped or cylindrical capsule long and wide with thin walls and the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Corymbia paractia was first formally in 1995 by Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson. The specific epithet (paractia) is from the Greek meaning \\"on the seaside\\", referring to the habitat of this species.

St Paul's Church, East Ham or St Paul's Church, Burges Road is a Church of England parish church in East Ham, Newham, east London. The church originated as a mission church of St Mary Magdalene's. Ynyr Burges (died 1792), Paymaster of the East India Company, had built up an estate in the area late in the 18th century, which his great grand-nephew Colonel Ynyr Burges began to develop as building land from about 1887 onwards. As part of this development, he gave land for the mission to build a temporary Mission Room (the present church hall), which opened on 24 May 1908. Three years later a Building Fund was established for the construction of a permanent church and in 1914 a small iron church hall was set up alongside the church. The mission church was given a parish of its own in 1924 and on 11 April that year Kendrick W Sibley was made its first vicar. ¬£2437 19 shillings and 10 pence had been raised by January 1931 and the diocese agreed that construction could begin on the permanent church, using Hammond and Miles of Ilford and re-using the temporary church's processional cross and stone font. The bells were recycled from a dismantled church at Wendle Lofts. In 1932 the parish's advowson was vested in the bishop of Chelmsford and on 30 September 1933 the new permanent church was consecrated, with the original church becoming a church hall.

WR 137, together with WR 134 and WR 135, was one of three stars in Cygnus observed in 1867 to have unusual spectra consisting of intense emission lines rather than the more normal continuum and absorption lines. These were the first members of the class of stars that came to be called Wolf-Rayet stars (WR stars) after Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet who discovered their unusual appearance. It is a member of the carbon sequence of WR stars, indicated by the lack of nitrogen lines and the strength of carbon emission. WR 137 has a spectrum with CIII emission weaker than CIV and OV weaker still, leading to the assignment of a WC7 spectral type. The spectrum also shows emission lines of HeII and OIV. WR 137 is a binary system, with an O9 main sequence or giant companion. The two stars orbit every thirteen years in a mildly eccentric orbit, and there is an episode of dust production near periastron. The inclination of the orbit is uncertain, most likely near 67¬∞ but with some analyses suggesting values around 23¬∞. The O star is visually brighter and more massive, but the WR star dominates the spectrum and has a higher bolometric luminosity. WR 137 is about a degree away from WR 135 and the two are believed to lie at approximately the same distance from Earth within the Cygnus OB3 association. Its properties are uncertain because of the presence of the hot luminous companion. A pseudo-fit of the combined spectrum yielded a temperature of 56,000 K, a luminosity of , and a radius of .

Pant Mawr operated from around 1850 to 1879, and was partly re-opened in 1886 when it was amalgamated with Fron-Boeth. Both quarries closed during the First World War. Finished product was transported to the slate quays of Porthmadog by the Croesor Tramway. History =Pant Mawr= Pant Mawr was the first of the two quarries to be established, around 1850. It was situated on the western slopes of Moelwyn Mawr, and was working the same slate vein as the Moelwyn quarry, which was situated on the south eastern slopes of the same mountain. Slate quarries in the Ffestiniog region, where the slate veins slope downwards at an angle, are worked as pillars and chambers, where two chambers on the same horizontal level are separated by a pillar of unquarried rock, of a similar thickness to the width of the chamber, in order to support the rock above. In order to maintain the stability of the quarry, chambers below that level are precisely aligned, so that the pillars on one floor are directly below those on the floor above. The upper levels of Moelwyn Quarry were at above ordnance datum (AOD), while Pant Mawr was around AOD. The integrity of the Moelwyn Quarry was ensured by making underground connections to it, and aligning the Pant Mawr chambers and pillars with those of the quarry above. The numbering sequence for the levels in the Moelwyn Quarry was continued downwards through the Pant Mawr Quarry. When first opened, there was no railway connection to the Croesor valley, and slates were transported to the Ffestiniog Railway at Penrhyndeudraeth by pack animals, using a route along Cwm Maesgwyn, which was also used by the Moelwyn quarry. Later in the 1850s, the quarry erected a small mill, and constructed an incline to transport the quarried rock to it. The next big advance took place in 1863, when a second incline was built to connect to the mill, and an access tramway was constructed to link with the Croesor Tramway, then being built by Hugh Beaver Roberts. The access tramway was built on a rock-cut shelf, partly following an old track, and then descended via two inclines, making it the highest two-pitch incline in the slate quarrying industry of Britain. The mill was upgraded in 1878 by the addition of a steam engine, and there were around 100 men working in the quarry at the time. However, work ceased in the following year, and the quarry was idle until 1886, when it was amalgamated with Fron-Boeth. Some of the chambers were worked subsequently, and four men were still working two or three chambers in 1905. =Fron-Boeth= A composite map of the Pant Mawr and Fron-Boeth quarries dating from 1899 and 1900 Fron- Boeth was an ambitious attempt, begun in 1886, to extend the Pant Mawr workings, starting from a new mill site at a lower level. It was never particularly successful, but employed around 50 men initially, with production decreasing in the early 1900s. The tramway from the top of the first incline to Pant Mawr had looped northwards in an 'S' shape to reach the foot of the second incline. This route was abandoned, and the first incline was extended upwards, through the drumhouse, to a ledge a little further up the hillside. It followed this ledge towards the south west, and then made a right-angle bend to enter a tunnel, which took it through the ridge between Cwm Croesor and Cwm Maesgwyn. The tunnel was around long, and was the only significant example of a tunnel created for an access tramway, rather than as part of a mine, in North Wales. There are several spoil tips near the far end to the tunnel, but these are formed of granite waste, as the quarry buildings were constructed from granite, rather than slate. The tramway turned back on itself to reach a second incline, from the head of which a further tramway followed the general direction of the one to Pant Mawr, but at a lower level. The tramway to Pant Mawr had been laid in bridge rails, but that to Fron-Boeth used conventional flat-bottomed rail. The main mill was steam powered, and above it, a single acting table incline was used to connect to a number of chambers which had been created below the original Pant Mawr workings. The levels were numbered downwards, in a continuation of the numbering scheme adopted by Moelwyn and Pant Mawr, and the mill was on level 18. The building was quite large, and housed at least three saw tables and three dressing machines, although there was room for several more. Beside the mill is a large Lancashire boiler, which was used to store water. A second mill was built near to the exit tunnel in the 1890s, and was designated as level 22. Its purpose may have been to serve lower levels, as the quarry extended down the hillside, or it may have been to process output from the Cefn-y-braich quarry. This consisted of two open terraces, which employed about 20 men between 1877 and 1883. It was subsequently absorbed into the Fron-Boeth operation, and the terraces became levels 19 and 20 in the Fron-Boeth numbering scheme. Like so many enterprises, precise details are often a little contradictory. There are entries in the Croesor Tramway accounts for Pant Mawr from September 1877 until May 1892. Separate entries for Fron-Boeth begin in 1886. Boyd states that Pant Mawr had been abandoned by 1916, and the tramway lifted by 1920, although large scale Ordnance Survey maps show no rails in 1900. Working of Fron-Boeth quarry ceased during the First World War, although the rails on the tramway remained in situ for many years. =Remains of the quarries today= Several of the Pant Mawr adits are still open, and the inclines from them to the mill are still in good condition. Much of the mill area is still intact, and the tramway track to the top of the inclines has survived. The drum house of the upper incline is ruined, but the incline and the embanking of the loop between the inclines is still extant. The drumhouse for the lower incline was demolished when the incline was extended. A feature of the Fron-Boeth mill is a large Lancashire boiler, which must have been conveyed to site via the Pant Mawr tramway, as it is too large to fit through the tunnel. There is a slate lined channel beside the single acting table incline, indicating that it may have been a water balance. There are foundations for an elevated office structure part way along the tramway. The drumhouse and incline are in reasonable condition, but the mill near the tunnel is ruined. The tunnel, one of the longest cut for horse drawn traffic, is accessible for most of its length, although it has collapsed near the northern portal. Some chambers have been cut within it. The drumhouse on the final incline, which was built to replace the one lower down when the Pant Mawr tramway was abandoned, includes some brake gear, and there are cable rollers on the incline.

Description Corymbia peltata is a tree that typically grows to a height of , rarely to and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, tessellated or flaky bark on the trunk and larger branches, smooth yellowish bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have more or less round to egg- shaped or elliptical leaves that are long, wide with a rough surface and petiolate. The leaves in the crown of the tree are almost all juvenile leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs, the same shade of dull green on both sides, more or less round to egg-shaped or elliptical, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged the ends of branchlets on branched peduncles long, each branch with seven more or less sessile buds. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with an operculum that is rounded with a central knob or conical. The flowers are white and the fruit is a barrel-shaped, urn-shaped or shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming This eucalypt was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham who gave it the name Eucalyptus peltata and published the description in Flora Australiensis. In 1995 Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia peltata. The specific epithet (peltata) is from the Latin word peltatus meaning peltate, referring to the attachment of the petiole to the leaf blade.

This company has also been involved with several solar energy research projects, any several of these projects have been in partnership with the European Commission. One example of an ongoing project with the European Commission is the ArtESun project, which seeks to bring new OPV (organic photovoltaic technologies) technologies to the thin-film PV market. Projects Onyx Solar PV glass has been used in building projects on five continents, including in the construction of the Miami Heat Stadium, the Dubai Frame, the Science Pyramid in Colorado and an award-winning residential building known as The General in Northcote, Australia.Windows have power producing glass; The Sydney Morning Herald; 25 July 2019 In March 2016, Onyx Solar signaled the completion of the installation of photovolatic glass at the entrance of the American Airlines Arena by announcing that its project had received the LEED Gold certification, which is the highest certificate for building sustainability. This project utilized around 300 crystalline silicon PV glass units, which were deployed in 14 circular skylights. This implementation allows American Airlines Arena to produce 34,500 kWh of solar power per year for on-site consumption. In June 2016, Apple announced that it will be fitting its retail stores in San Francisco with walkable solar glass floors for the purpose of generating electricity. The integration of solar power directly into its retail stores has been used as an example of Apple's focus on renewable technology. These walkways will be constructed with Thin-film solar cell technology. Onyx Solar also documents all of its projects in its professional experience book. This book includes details about its involvement with the construction of the Dubai Frame and its work on the Tanjong Pagar building in Singapore (which will become the largest skyscraper in Singapore upon completion).

Aligned along the south side of Railroad Avenue and adjacent portions of Main Street, the area underwent most of its development between 1900 and 1940, when Essex Junction served as a major regional railroad hub. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history The village of Essex Junction originally developed in the early 19th century as a mill village, based on the water power of the adjacent Winooski River. With the advent of the railroads, the village, benefiting from its proximity to Burlington, Vermont's largest city, became a major regional railroad hub, with six different railroad lines meeting in the area. The downtown area was almost completely destroyed by a fire in 1893, but was rebuilt in the following decades. Although the railroads declined in use after World War II, the village continues to serve freight traffic, and has a passenger station on Amtrak's Vermonter service. with The central focal point of the historic district is the Brownell Block, a two-story brick commercial building (pictured) at the western corner of Main Street and Railroad Avenue. It extends on the southwest side of Railroad Avenue to Central Street, and along Main Street from the \\"Five Corners\\" junction (Main, Pearl, Maple, Park, and Lincoln Streets) to Railroad Street, just across the Amtrak railroad tracks. The twelve buildings in this area are typically two stories in height. Most are of wood frame construction, but many have been faced in brick; only two buildings are of entirely masonry construction. Half the buildings were built before 1900, with only one (3 Main Street) predating the 1893 fire. Only one building (a former grocery store at 26 Railroad Avenue) was built after 1920.

Irish aristocrat from Ballymascanlan, County Louth, a prolific botanical illustrator and pioneering mountaineer.  Family  Plunket was born at Kilsaran, near Castlebellingham in County Louth. Her father Thomas Plunket, 2nd Baron Plunket (1792‚Äì1866), was a junior Church of Ireland clergyman and later became the Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry. Her mother Louise Jane Foster (married in 1819) was the daughter of John William Foster of Fanevalley, County Louth, Member of Parliament for Dunleer,Burke's Peerage 1970, Plunket also Massereene and Ferrard and was related to the Earl of Clermont. Her grandfather was William Plunket, 1st Baron Plunket, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Her first and second cousins included three titled members of the Irish aristocracy. Her eldest sister Katherine Plunket was known as Ireland's oldest person at 111 years and 327 days. Botanical illustration  Plunket travelled Europe with her sister Katherine Plunket and they made many sketches of flowers in France, Italy, Spain and Germany, and Ireland. These were bound in a volume, Wild Flowers from Nature, which was presented in 1903 to the Royal College of Science, and was later transferred to the Museum of Science and Art in the National Museum of Ireland. In 1970 it was part of the collections which were transferred to the Irish National Botanic Gardens at Glasnevin. Mountaineering  Plunket wrote a book about her mountaineering and experiences travelling the Alps in the 1870s. Here and there among the Alps, published 1875. The book was expressly written for women interested in mountaineering and to show them what was possible for the active healthy woman. It was a rejection of the notion that mountaineering was always a dangerous impossible challenge for women, despite a belief that women were somewhat physically inferior. In fact she encouraged women to pass boundaries. The book describes assents of multiple peaks in Switzerland undertaken in 1874 although the introduction indicates that this is only one of several years of climbing. Despite her insistence in the introduction to her book that dangers were over emphasised Plunket herself experienced potentially fatal accidents while climbing. Although now reported it was Lucy Walker who first succeeded in reaching the top, Anne Rathdonnell, The 1st Lady Rathdonnell wrote in her diary in 1879, that Plunket was known as the first woman to the top of the Matterhorn:\\"I remember meeting several times in Chester Square the Hon.

The Serra da Maravilha is one of the main conservation areas in the municipality along with the Serra do Taquaru√ßu (Araponga Municipal Nature Park) and Pedra das Flores Natural Monument. A dam located in the APA is the main source of water for the town. The APA contains a water treatment station. The Maravilha APA contains alpine meadows and secondary growth forest, surrounded by agricultural land and pastures. Some of the agricultural activities are irregular, and the farmers extract firewood from the APA improperly. The APA includes large farms and conventional horticulture, and is poorly managed. History  The Maravilha Environmental Protection Area was created by municipal decree 1.652 of 5 June 2006. It is administered by the Secretaria Municipal de Meio Ambiente. The purpose is to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. It was included in the Central Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest Mosaic, created in December 2006. As of 2010 there was no management plan. The drought in 2014 caused low water in the dam, leading to supply of water from contaminated streams in the region.

Paleosurfaces might be flat or uneven in some cases having considerable relief. Flat and large paleosurfaces ‚Äîthat is planation surfaces‚Äî have higher potential to be preserved than small and irregular surfaces and are thus the most studied kind of paleosurfaces. Irregular paleosurfaces, albeit usually smaller than flat ones, occur across the globe, one example being the Sudetes etchsurfaces. In the case of peneplains it is argued that they become paleosurfaces once they are detached from the base level they grade to. Paleosurfaces form an important part of the geologic record in that they represent geological and geomorphological events. Traditionally geologist and geomorphologist view paleosurfaces differently. Geologists look into the endogenic or constructive processes occurring to create that surface, such as crustal uplift and igneous activity. The stratigraphic record is valued by geologists allowing for a broader range of surface types to be considered. However, when paleosurfaces are viewed by geomorphologists the exogenic or deconstructive processes are considered. This is because geomorphologists are primarily concerned with erosional and weathering processes. Geomorphologist Richard Huggett lists paleosurfaces as one of various categorizations of paleoplains.

History The abbey was built during the second half of the 17th century, patronized by the Baron Giacomo II Bonanno Crisafi. The ruins are in restoration and part now houses the museo etno-antropologico of the town. The church, now deconsecrated, was completed in 1716, and located at the site of a former Oratory of Santa Barbara, held by a local fraternity.

The cathedral accommodates more than 2,000 worshippers and serves as the site for major liturgical celebrations, pilgrimages, and events for the Catholic community of eastern North Carolina. The existing Sacred Heart Cathedral will be retained and honored as the first church designated to be the Cathedral for the Diocese of Raleigh but will be renamed Sacred Heart Church. Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral was designed by the architecture firm of O'Brien & Keane, based in Arlington, Virginia, and built by Clancy & Theys Construction Company of Raleigh, North Carolina. It is the fifth-largest cathedral in the United States.https://www.cbs17.com/news/media-gets-peak-at-raleighs-new-41-million- cathedral/1017007134  History  The cathedral under construction in 2016 In 1899, Fr. Thomas F. Price and his sister, Sr. Mary Agnes of the Sisters of Mercy, founded a Catholic orphanage on a large property of land that Price had purchased in his own name adjacent to the city of Raleigh. The orphanage, serving primary and secondary school aged children, initially was an all-boys institution, but later also served girls. In the early 1950s, Bishop Vincent Waters decreed that all racial discrimination in Catholic parishes and institutions in the Diocese of Raleigh cease, so the high school students at the Nazareth Orphanage were transferred to Cathedral Latin High School at Sacred Heart Cathedral. Two years later the Nazareth Orphanage's elementary school closed. In the 1960s, Cathedral Latin High School was the only Catholic high school in Raleigh, and was not large enough to accommodate the growing population of Catholics. Bishop Waters built a new high school, Cardinal Gibbons High School, on a portion of the former Nazareth Orphanage site. The school was moved in the late 1990s to its current location after a request was made by Bishop F. Joseph Gossman. The Nazareth Property housed the Diocese of Raleigh Catholic Center, which serves as the headquarters for the Bishop and administrative staff of the Diocese, until 2014 when it was moved to a building off of Creedmoor Road. In 2011, Bishop Michael F. Burbidge announced the construction of a new cathedral to replace the existing Sacred Heart Cathedral, due to the need for a larger church to accommodate the growing number of Catholics. Fundraising for the cathedral campaign began in September 2011. Groundbreaking for the Cathedral took place on January 3, 2015. The construction of the cathedral cost forty-six million dollars. The cathedral was dedicated on July 26, 2017.  Description  Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral is arranged in a cruciform layout and has a gross floor area of approximately 43,000 square feet. The main axis of the building is placed in an east‚Äìwest orientation, with the entrance to the west. This is in keeping with Catholic tradition and reflects the spirituality of Catholicism in Sacred Scripture (Mt 2:1-2, Mt 24:27, Lk 13:29, Rev 16:12). The sanctuary‚Äîincluding the altar of sacrifice, ambo, and cathedra‚Äîis located under the dome, while the tabernacle is placed within the eastern apse. Seating for the congregation, illuminated by clerestory windows, is located within the nave and transepts and is separated from the side aisles by an arcade. A mezzanine, located above and to the west of the nave, is provided to accommodate choir, organ and musicians. The transition from the sacred spaces to the surrounding grounds is bridged by a tall narthex, from which one may also access the Chapel of All Saints. Outside of the main entrance is a public plaza to allow vehicles to approach the cathedral and circulate out to parking areas, as well as to serve as a gathering place for those visiting the Cathedral.  Exterior  = Chapel = The Chapel's primary function in the Cathedral is to provide a quiet space for reflection and adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. As such, the architecture presents an elevated design and incorporates the Corinthian Order. Its exterior is rendered completely in cast stone, to distinguish it from the rest of the building and denote its importance. The Chapel windows are also from the Church of the Ascension in Philadelphia, and were designed by JM Kase & Company Art Stained Glass. There are a total of seven windows in the Chapel; four depicting the Evangelists, two decorative windows, and one round window depicting an angel. = Cornerstone = Cornerstone In December 2015, Bishop Michael F. Burbidge, then Bishop of the Diocese of Raleigh, presented Pope Francis with the cornerstone for the Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral. Pope Francis blessed the cornerstone for the Cathedral, assuring Bishop Burbidge and the Diocese of Raleigh of his prayers. It was designed by the architect and is made of Santafiora stone. It is inscribed with the image of a Christogram, the ancient emblem of the name of Jesus, and represents the dedication of the Cathedral. The Christogram, along with the inscription of the year 2017, are rendered in gold. The Cornerstone was installed on July 21, 2017, five days before the dedication of the new Cathedral. = Dome = Dome The stature of Holy Name of Jesus Cathedral is architecturally conveyed by the inclusion of a prominent dome, the significance of which was described by the architect: The 162-ton copper-clad ribbed dome was constructed on the ground and lifted into place via crane in a remarkable feat by the contractor. A decorative finial and a cross embellish the top of the dome, which reaches to a total height of 173 feet above the ground. The drum of the dome, adorned with a range of paired Corinthian columns and entablature and sixteen arched windows, is located directly above the sanctuary platform below it. The dome is composed of an inner and outer shell, with a cavity between them. This space provides access to the top of the dome through the interstitial space, for access to the engineering systems. The interior of the dome exhibits many of the same characteristics as its exterior, including Corinthian pilasters and ribs. The interior height of the dome reaches 137 feet above the floor below. = Materials = The fa√ßade of the Cathedral is predominantly wood- mold brick, yielding a soft impression to the masonry. The brick was specified in a \\"rose\\" color, with a high degree of color range intended to lend visual interest to the building's exterior. This material and color recalls the region's architectural heritage, as do the grapevine mortar joints. Cast stone, specified in a range of colors, is incorporated into the most prominent parts of the building, such as the West entry fa√ßade and the exterior of the chapel. The roof surfaces are clad in copper. = Nave and transept walls = The exterior walls of the Nave and Transepts feature paired arched windows at the floor level, arranged in a total of 22 bays, with single arched windows centered above the pairs in the clerestory of each bay. In a simplified expression of the interior architectural language, the masonry features corbelling (intentional, minor projections in the brickwork) to lend relief and interest to the surface of the structure through shadow, and to enhance the design details, articulating the bays and conveying the building's structural strategy on its exterior. The voussoirs forming the arches are custom-made tapered shapes, in order to allow the joints to remain parallel, and to relieve the workmen of the laborious and dangerous task of saw-cutting brick on-site. The stained glass windows are in part salvaged from the Church \\"Ascension of Our Lord\\" in Philadelphia, PA, where ten large windows were flanked by two smaller ones. In the Cathedral design, these two smaller windows remain grouped with their respective larger windows, but are simply placed at the ground level instead of the clerestory level, thereby relating to their original arrangement. The salvaged windows were designed by Paula Balano and restored by Beyer Studios in Philadelphia, PA. Beyer Studios also designed additional windows for the Cathedral, which are placed in an alternating pattern with the salvaged stained-glass windows throughout the Nave and Transepts. The newly fabricated windows feature the same border design as the original windows, but include translucent glass fields instead of biblical scenes as depicted by the Balano windows. The diamond-patterned window fields reference the diamond motif that is repeated throughout the Cathedral, including the glass in many of the interior doors and in the lighting fixtures. This pattern also references the Diocese of Raleigh's Coat- of-Arms, which incorporates seven diamonds. = Tower = Tower The bell tower reaches to a height of 154 feet and contains 50 bells, ranging in size from 18 pounds to nearly a ton. Forty-nine of the bells were fabricated by Verdin Bells & Clocks. One bell was salvaged from the original Holy Name of Jesus Chapel which once stood on the same property as the Cathedral. They were blessed by Bishop Burbidge in November 2016 and were installed the week of April 17, 2017. A cross with a decorative flag tops the tower, which also includes a decorative balustrade, engaged Corinthian columns and moldings, rustication of the brickwork, and quoins along the tower's corners. Five of these bells have been inscribed with the mottos of the five bishops of the diocese of Raleigh. The inscriptions are: > \\"Emitte Spiritum Tuum\\" (Send forth thy spirit) - Most Reverend William J. > Hafey, First Bishop of Raleigh \\"Omnia Omnibus\\" (All things to all men, from > 1 Corinthians 9:22) - Most Reverend Eugene J. McGuinness, Second Bishop of > Raleigh \\"Omnia Per Mariam\\" (All through Mary) - Most Reverend Vincent S. > Waters, Third Bishop of Raleigh \\"To serve, not be served\\" - Most Reverend F. > Joseph Gossman, Fourth Bishop of Raleigh \\"Walk humbly with God\\" - Most > Reverend Michael F. Burbidge, Fifth Bishop of Raleigh = Transept ends = The brickwork, cast stone piers, parapet, and window surrounds of the Transept ends relate visually the entry fa√ßade in composition, but are rendered in a simplified design expression, without the Doric or Ionic features visible at the entrance of the building. = West (Entry) Fa√ßade = The design for the entry announces the design theme for the building and introduces classical orders: the Doric order, in the tradition of classical Roman architectural design, constitutes the first tier of the fa√ßade, while the Ionic order fills the second tier. A field of brick above the cast stone entry is punctuated by a 12-foot diameter round window, framed with cast stone. Cast stone piers and an entablature that tend toward a Romanesque design expression bound the composition.  Interior  1024x1024px = Chapel = The Chapel of All Saints, which is intended to serve as a place of quiet reflection and Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, is embedded into the main cathedral building with its windows facing south and is entered from the narthex. The chapel seats forty congregants, and features marble liturgical furnishings that relate to those in the main sanctuary. The Chapel Tabernacle, much like the Main Tabernacle, is designed as a miniature, idealized version of the chapel. The architect designed the tabernacle so that its fa√ßade appears as he imagined the front of the chapel itself might have been, had it not been conjoined with the main building. For example, the tabernacle displays a detached range of Corinthian columns, as seen on the exterior of the actual chapel, as well as a hip roof. The Tabernacle and altar are both rendered in Bianco Carrara C marble with Giallo Sienna marble accents. The altar is inscribed with the Alpha-Omega symbol, again representing the Book of Revelation, where these letters are used to represent Christ as the \\"beginning and the end.\\" = Choir loft and mezzanine = The mezzanine, including the choir loft and organ, is approximately 3500 square feet. The choir loft seats approximately 60 people including seating for 30 instrumental musicians. The loft features risers for the choir as well as a platform for the seated musicians and space for a piano. One of the most impressive furnishings in size and scale, the pipe organ (Opus 147) was designed and built by CB Fisk and features 61 stops. According to Fisk, \\"the organ's tonal design, developed with the requirements of the Roman Catholic liturgies in mind, is largely, but not exclusively, influenced by the English Romantic organs.\\" The organ was installed in the Fall of 2018.http://www.cbfisk.com/sites/default/files/instruments/specifications/147_spec.pdf = Endo Narthex = The Endo-Narthex, located between the Narthex and the Nave, is the site of the confessionals. The design for the four stained-oak confessionals was inspired by a traditional precedent seen in Italy by Bishop Michael Burbidge, updated to accommodate modern norms. = Narthex = The design theme for the narthex was inspired by the courtyards of antiquity, featuring the classical orders of Doric and Ionic, and a barrel vault. In this transition space from indoors to outdoors, the narthex, similar to an open atrium, is expanded to allow the congregants to gather and greet one another prior to Mass, a preference voiced by parishioners. The architect commented that \\"the design will be similar to other Cathedrals, in that we are building on a 2000-year heritage of sacred architecture. At the same time, the Cathedral is intended to be a reflection of the values of the faithful of North Carolina, and so it is bound to be unique in that way.\\" = Nave and transepts = The interior of the nave and transepts repeats the articulation and rhythm of the exterior, providing further continuity in the architecture. The Classical orders of Doric and Ionic on the exterior walls, as described above, are recalled once more on the interior of the aisle arcade and triforium. Colossal piers superimposed over these two tiers support the ribs of the barrel vault. The apex of the barrel vault above reaches 77'-10\\" above the floor. The nave and transepts seat 2,000 congregants; each transept seats 500 people and the nave welcomes 1,000 people. The layout intentionally allows for the pews to be proximate to the altar, thereby enhancing the sense of connection and access between the assembly and the sanctuary. The perimeter of the interior is generously appointed with liturgical artwork. The ends of the transepts house shrines to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception and St. Joseph the Worker, and feature carved statues rendered in lifelike tones. The side aisles also contain twenty-four similar statues of selected saints, including one niche that stands in reserve for Reverend Thomas Price, Servant of God, the first native-born North Carolinian to be ordained a Catholic priest. His Cause for Beatification and Canonization is currently under review in Rome. The fourteen Stations of the Cross seen throughout the Nave and Transept aisles are restored, painted wood, of a similar vintage as the windows. The baptismal font is located at the western end of the Nave, on the axis of symmetry. The basin of the font measures 6 feet in diameter, and the element was designed by the architect and fabricated along with the balance of the liturgical furnishings. It is solid Bianco Carrara C marble and stands atop an octagonal marble flooring pattern of Bardiglio Nuvolato, arranged so that the natural veins of the marble appears to radiate from the font, representing the flow of water. = Sanctuary = Below the dome, the Sanctuary platform houses the vital liturgical furnishings, with the Altar of Sacrifice as the focal element. All of the liturgical furnishings, which were designed by the architect, are rendered in Bianco Carrara C marble, with Giallo Siena marble accents on the pilasters and panels. The design of the altar incorporates elements of the Ionic order, and the other furnishings, including the Cathedra, Ambo, and Altar Rail, relate with a consistent design language. The sanctuary flooring features Bardiglio Nuvolato marble slabs with diamond accents of Bianco Carrara C. The principal elements of Altar, Ambo, and Cathedra are surrounded by a border of Bianco Carrara C marble with Giallo Siena diamond accents. The Tabernacle was conceived as a miniature, idealized cathedral, and was constructed entirely in marble. It features details such as a lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl roundel, which represents the rose window, as well as a gold door. The tabernacle stands on a highly elevated platform within the apse. The design of the apse is informed by a scripture passage found in Revelation 4:2-7, which provides a description of Heaven as the Lamb joined by four creatures, 24 elders in white robes with golden crowns, and seven lamps.

She was born in a middle- class family, her mother Zora was en economist, and her father Zdenko an administrative lawyer. In her town of birth she completed her primary and secondary education, and she graduated in Comparative Literature and Russian Language from the Faculty of Philosophy at Zagreb University. She also studied journalism at the Faculty of Political Sciences in Zagreb She obtained her doctoral degree with a thesis on Russian emigrants' literature. Her first critical reviews were published in the mid-1970s, in a music magazine. At the time she started collaborating as translator with a number of editions of Vjesnik newspaper. Short stories published in various magazines in the late 1970s marked her literary debut. The year 1981 saw the publication of her first novel Hostel for Train-escorting Personnel, which the literary critics immediately included in the category of so-called prose in jeans, i.e. youthful rebellion against authority and social restrictions. The novel Seeking a Spoon and the collection of short stories Seven Stories or One Life may be said to belong to a similar stylistic formation, while the short-story collection Nights in White Satin (1995) is characterized by a postmodernist view on reality as a game in language. The novel Return of the Broken Arrow (2000), dealing with the war in Croatia, indicates a turn towards reality. Accordingly, the novel Celestial Cyclists (2008) is set in the 1960s and interspersed with documentary material from the sphere of pop-culture, and the book of travel prose Desperately Foreboding Cohen (2013) is based on cultural references important to the 20th century and the literary proc√©d√© typical of the adventure genre. Essays have a special place in the oeuvre of Irena Luk≈°iƒá. The texts interpret in a unique, almost poetic fashion the phenomena characteristic of the modern times: the culture of celebrities, travels, food and pets. Namely, the author inquires into the said phenomena through the prism of literary works published in the book-series \\"In the Wake of the Classics\\" (published in Zagreb as joint project of Croatian Philological Society and Disput), establishing a link with the general state of mind of the post-historical period, but also with her own biographical situation (Diaries, Dream Books, Dictionaries, 2009). Irena Luk≈°iƒá is a distinguished expert in Russian emigrants' literature and translator from the Russian language. She has received numerous prizes and awards for her work as artist, expert and translator.

Overview  In the spring of 2015, South Korean Internet forum DC Inside started \\"MERS Gallery\\" as a forum for sharing information on the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak. When a false rumor spread that two women who might have contracted the MERS disease refused quarantine to go on a shopping trip to Hong Kong, it prompted bashing in this forum. These supposed health code violators were derided using the term \\"Kimchi woman\\" (; gimchi-nyeo), a stereotype for the female gender who only has shopping on her mind. As this situation continued, an influx of feminist users started using offensive terms, coining \\"Kimchi man\\" (; gimchi-nam) a counterpart male-bashing term which mocks Korean males in general. DC Inside intervened by instituting a language policy, forbidding use of \\"Kimchi man\\". The feminist users regarded the measure as discriminatory, and finding these rules too constraining for posting their rhetoric, moved to other forums at DC Inside, and eventually, launched their own website, \\"Megalia\\". The name \\"Megalia\\" is a portmanteau of \\"MERS Gallery\\" and Egalia's Daughters, a feminist novel by Gerd Brantenberg.  Culture  In Megalia, there are several boards, including the \\"best\\" board, \\"new posts\\" board, \\"Menyeom (meaning suitable for Megalia) board\\", \\"news\\" board, \\"data\\" board, \\"lecture\\" board, \\"capture\\" board, \\"humor\\" board, and \\"free\\" board.\\"Í≤åÏãúÌåê ÏÜåÍ∞ú Î∞è Ïù¥Ïö©Ïûê Ï§ÄÏàòÏÇ¨Ìï≠ [Guide to the boards and user rules]\\" - Megalia When it was founded Megalia claimed that it was a feminist website and that its goal was to \\"promote women's rights and remove misogyny widespread in the Korean society.\\" Megalia began a movement to halt the porn- sharing site SoraNet (ÏÜåÎùºÎÑ∑)'s practice which permitted uploads of privacy- violating secretly photographed video content, and has moved on to petition the shutdown of the site itself, which was notorious for various types of illicit pornographic content. Eventually, SoraNet was shutdown. Controversies Megalia is widely perceived as an extremist, feminist community, which consciously mirrors the misogynistic language deployed in male-dominated forums like Ilbe. To critics, Megalians‚Äô mirroring tactic is hateful and misandrist; to supporters, they are reclaiming a male-centered language that threatens and diminishes women. Many, including some feminists, say Megalia's tactics have opened the group up to accusations of misandry, and exacerbating the gender war. Some Megalia posters have outed gay men who are married to women. On October 17, 2015, one user, who was a kindergarten teacher, uploaded a salacious post declaring their desire to have sex with a Jonnini Ï¢ÜÎ¶∞Ïù¥, which is Megalia slang for a very young male child. This caused an uproar, especially after her identity was outed, even though she had posted anonymously. The poster (referred to in the media as \\"Ms. A\\") later addressed this, and while admitting the gravity of her message which caused serious concerns, explained that she was merely trying to bring awareness to the fact that male-dominated boards such as Ilbe routinely discuss sexual desires for underage girls (referred to as lolini Î°úÎ¶∞Ïù¥ (\\"Lolita girl\\"). (Naver News) Users of Megalia have posted gory images of men whose penises have been severed or severely damaged and publicized explicit photos obtained in confidence,. One of Megalia's activities is the manipulation of public opinion. Megalia users share news articles‚Äô URLs and manipulate comment sections led by their administrative team with a suggested guideline. Since December 2015, administrators and financial backers of the website have continuously received criticism on their lack of transparency, but no official statement has been released. In October 2018, following the Isu Station assault case, more than 129,500 Koreans signed an online petition asking for the presidential office to take measure against the extremist feminist communities, including Womad and Megalia. Even users of Megalia tend to confuse why they use it, ‚ÄúI was the explosive into feminism in the flow of Megalia. I did Megalia, and in a rather brash voice I shouted the gender revolution.

Matthew was a late-season Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale, having formed in the southeastern Caribbean on September 28\\\\. The hurricane weakened to Category 4 before making landfall near Les Anglais on October 4, at which time the National Hurricane Center estimated maximum sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph). This made it the strongest storm to hit the nation since Hurricane Cleo in 1964, and the third strongest Haitian landfall on record. Hurricane- force winds - or greater - affected about 1.125 million people in the country. The Haitian government assessed the death toll at 546, although other sources reported more than three times that figure. During Matthew's passage, high winds, heavy rainfall, and deadly tides lashed the Tiburon Peninsula in southwest Haiti. Nationwide, the hurricane nearly or completely destroyed around 200,000 homes, leaving 1.4 million people in need of humanitarian aid. Monetary damage was estimated at US$2.8 billion. Nearly complete crop damage occurred in Grand'Anse and Sud departments, leaving the impoverished population without a source of food. Communication networks and the road system were also compromised. After the hurricane washed away the Petit-Go√¢ve Bridge, southwestern Haiti was temporarily unreachable from the remainder of the country, which slowed the distribution of emergency aid. The ongoing cholera outbreak worsened after the hurricane, killing at least 29 people. With insufficient resources to respond to the hurricane damage, the Haitian government requested assistance from other countries. The United Nations launched an emergency appeal for nearly US$120 million in aid, and countries throughout the world provided money, supplies, and logistical support. Before and after the hurricane's landfall, UN agencies provided food, materials, and a peacekeeping force to residents, which was supplemented by various non- government organizations. Background Tropical Storm Matthew developed on September 28 from a tropical wave moving through the southern Lesser Antilles. Low wind shear and warm waters favored strengthening, and the storm intensified into a hurricane on September 29. Early on October 1, following a period of rapid deepening, Matthew reached Category 5 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale, with peak sustained winds of 270 km/h (165 mph) while north of the Colombia coast. Upwelling of cooler waters subsequently caused Matthew to weaken to a Category 4 hurricane. By October 3, the hurricane was moving northward through the Caribbean around the western periphery of a large ridge, while maintaining Category 4 intensity. On the next day, Matthew re- intensified to attain a minimum central pressure of , along with winds of 240 km/h (150 mph) around its well-defined eye. On October 4 at 11:00 UTC, the storm made landfall on the Tiburon Peninsula of southwestern Haiti near Les Anglais at this intensity. Matthew was third strongest on record to hit the country, and the strongest to hit Haiti since Hurricane Cleo in 1964, which also struck as a Category 4. Water vapor loop of Matthew making landfall in Haiti on October 4 Haiti, the poorest country in the western hemisphere, was recovering from an ongoing cholera outbreak and a powerful earthquake in 2010, and many houses damaged during the earthquake were not rebuilt when Matthew struck. There were 25 humanitarian organizations working in impoverished Grand'Anse in southwestern Haiti before the storm made landfall. Ahead of the annual hurricane season, the World Food Programme (WFP) had pre-positioned 3,410 tons of food in the form of High Energy Biscuits, 30 tons of which was utilized immediately following the storm. Life-threatening rainfall was forecast to affect much of the nation, with accumulations averaging along the southern coast with isolated peaks up to . Preparations A map of forecast rainfall totals from Hurricane Matthew for the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas. Peak accumulations in excess of were expected along the southern coast of Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula. On September 30, the Haitian government issued a tropical storm watch for Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula toward the border with the Dominican Republic, although the forecast at the time was for Matthew to pass over Jamaica. Following an eastward shift in Matthew's predicted track, this was changed to a hurricane watch and later warning that encompassed the entire country. The government activated its National Emergency Operations Center, ordered a halt to coastal shipping, and started issuing evacuation notices. Residents on outlying islands of Haiti were evacuated to the mainland. Provisional President Jocelerme Privert addressed the nation on October 2, urging those living along the coast and in poorly constructed homes to evacuate and comply with authorities. On the same day, the government issued a red alert, advising residents to listen to instructions from authorities, secure their property, and prepare food kits. Although government officials held meetings on storm preparation, Radio France Internationale reported that Haiti did not have the logistical capability to handle a large-scale disaster. Only 576 shelters, with a collective capacity of 90,000 people, were listed for all of southern Haiti. Despite pleas from officials, many residents refused to leave their homes. A total of 1,300 shelters were readied with a total capacity of 390,000 people, insufficient for the population threatened in the storm path. Citing this problem and civic responsibility, officials asked residents in secure homes to welcome vulnerable neighbors. The Haitian government sent funds to 145 municipalities, after mayors complained that they had insufficient supplies. Government offices remained open during the storm, while schools were closed from October 3‚Äì10 to serve as shelters, causing the school calendar to be adjusted. By the day before the storm made landfall, 340,000 people had evacuated to these shelters. At least 500 people evacuated from J√©r√©mie, and patients at the Les Cayes hospital were evacuated. In Ouest, which contains the capital Port-au- Prince, about 55,000 people evacuated ahead of the storm. Although civil protection officials took to the streets to warn people, many residents were unaware that Matthew was even approaching the country a day before its expected landfall. Evacuations continued through the hurricane's landfall with the total number of people in shelters reaching 9,280 by 2:00 a.m. local time on October 4. Hundreds of prisoners were also evacuated to safer areas during the storm passage. More than 18,000 volunteers and members of the Red Cross, community intervention teams, municipal committees, and local emergency services were readied to assist residents. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 55,107 internally displaced persons remained in camps or hosting sites without adequate protection from the hurricane. Ahead of the storm, the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED) sent a crew of 35 people to seven shelters in southwestern Haiti, capable of disaster assessment and providing relief in the storm aftermath. The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination also sent a team to assist the efforts of the Haitian government, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) also activated its crew within the country. Ahead of the storm, officials shut down the Hugo Ch√°vez and Toussaint Louverture international airports, causing several flights to be canceled. The airport in Port-au-Prince remained closed until October 6, only allowing in planes carrying humanitarian aid. Officials also halted travel by cars during the storm's passage until October 5. Impacts Microwave image of rainfall rates in Matthew shortly before landfall in Haiti on October 4, showing rainfall over per hour occurring along the coasts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic Hurricane Matthew made landfall over southwestern Haiti as a powerful Category 4 hurricane on the morning of October 4. According to UNOSAT, Matthew affected about 1.125 million people with hurricane-force winds - at least 119 km/h (74 mph) - mostly in Sud. In Ouest, which contains the capital Port-au- Prince, nearly 4 million people experienced winds of at least 60 km/h (37 mph). Heavy rainfall ranged from across southern Haiti, with 24 hour totals of over around the Gulf of Gon√¢ve. The storm surge, estimated around , flooded at least 11 municipalities along the coast. Haiti politician Fran√ßois Anick Joseph described the storm effects in the southern portion of the country as \\"complete destruction\\". The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank estimated total damage around $1.89 billion. Nationwide, the hurricane severely damaged about 200,000 homes, with 90% of the houses along the southern coast destroyed. The storm knocked down 90% of coconut trees on the Tiburon Peninsula, and destroyed entire coffee and cocoa plantations. With most of the region's crops destroyed and 350,350 animals killed, residents in southern Haiti were left without a source of food. Matthew's strong winds knocked power lines and cell towers, which limited communications in the days following the storm, and left about 80% of the Tiburon Peninsula without power. A damaged antenna cut communications with Sud, and there were interruptions to the Digicel mobile phone network. Excessive flooding along 13 watersheds, as well as the heavy forestry damage, killed many forest and fruit species. The flooding produced mudslides that washed out roads and bridges. Along Route Nationale #2, the hurricane washed away the Petit-Go√¢ve Bridge, which is the only bridge linking the nation's capital Port-au-Prince with southwestern Haiti. This meant that relief workers and supplies temporarily had to travel by air to reach the most affected areas. A temporary bridge to transport humanitarian relief was constructed by October 6. Across southern Haiti, the hurricane damaged 70% of the polling locations for the Haitian presidential election scheduled for October 9; as a result of the storm, the election was postponed to an undetermined date on October 5. Nationwide, Matthew damaged over 400 schools, while 150 other schools functioned as shelters for around 16,000 evacuees. Damage to schools affected about 130,000 children, many of whom had just started their school year, and were in need of a new location for their education. Of the nation's 15 main hospitals, one was destroyed and another four were damaged, with 35 medical clinics damaged, many of these were understaffed and unable to cope with the number of incoming patients. The hurricane's violent winds shredded vegetation across the Tiburon Peninsula, rendering the lush tropical landscape brown and barren. Before Matthew moved ashore, a sick woman died in Port-Salut due to high storm tides preventing her travel to a hospital, and a man was missing as a result of a boat wreck. Hurricane Matthew proved deadly for the country; one day after the storm made landfall, there were five known fatalities related to the storm, which rose to 108 by October 6, including 50 people killed in the coastal town of Roche-√†-Bateaux. The death toll increased sharply to 842 by the next day, once the hardest hit areas of the Tiburon Peninsula were reached; many of the fatalities were due to people refusing to evacuate and who were trapped beneath the rubble of destroyed houses. This included 264 deaths in Sud, of whom 158 died in Les Anglais where Matthew moved ashore. There were at least 500 fatalities in Grand'Anse, and nationwide as many as 1,600 unconfirmed deaths. These numbers were lower according to the Haitian government, which reported a death toll of 546 as of October 15. =Effects by region= Poorly constructed homes failed to withstand hurricane-force winds. Countless corrugated tin roofs fell victim to the storm. Grand'Anse bore the brunt of Hurricane Matthew, becoming isolated after communications networks were cut. Throughout the department, the hurricane destroyed or severely damaged 86,223 houses, which displaced about 99,400 families. Almost every tree in Grand'Anse was knocked down, while nearly all rivers were flooded. Nearly all of the crops in the department were destroyed, and about half of all livestock were killed. In J√©r√©mie, the capital of the department, the strong winds ripped off nearly every roof, damaging 13,753 buildings. The hurricane decimated every building not made of concrete, including 90% of houses, and 80% of all structures. Floods in J√©r√©mie inundated an orphanage, forcing 123 children to be evacuated, and 141 roads were damaged. In Sud, Hurricane Matthew severely damaged 15 of the 18 communes. The storm destroyed 95% of all shelters and at least 29,000 homes, along with most ports and fishing equipment. Damage was most significant in Les Cayes, capital of Sud. Ten hours of high wind gusts destroyed the roofs of most houses, shops, and service stations, including the main cathedral, injuring over 3,000 people. About 70-80% of the houses in the city lost their roof or were flooded, of which around 20% had collapsed walls. Several businesses were washed away in Les Cayes. √éle-√†-Vache, an island adjacent to Les Cayes, reported floods up to deep. Livestock were killed when farms \\"disappeared\\", according to a member of Heifer International. All crops in the city were damaged, and over 90% of the crops wrecked throughout the department. Significant damage to crops, fisheries, and livestock occurred in Nippes, Ouest, Sud-Est, Artibonite, and Nord-Ouest departments. High damage in Nippes left half of the population in need of humanitarian aid. In Grand-Go√¢ve toward the eastern end of the Tiburon Peninsula, Matthew damaged or destroyed 500 houses, killing seven in the city. The road to Jacmel along the southeastern coast of Haiti was damaged, and many houses in the city were damaged. In Belle-Anse, located in the same department as Jacmel, Matthew destroyed about 80% of the crops. After the water flow increased at the P√©ligre Dam in Centre department, residents downstream were warned for potentially further flooding. In Gressier, the hurricane wrecked about 80% of agriculture plantations. Several neighborhoods around Port-au-Prince lost power and were flooded during the storm due to the rising levels of the Rivi√®re Grise; a bridge along the river was closed due to floodwaters. Also in the city, the hurricane damaged or destroyed 352 shelters or tents for 14 camps of internally displaced people, along with 279 latrines. In Artibonite, Matthew flooded 1,350 houses and left 123,000 people without a source of food. The storm also destroyed about 60% of the crops in Nord-Ouest. On the offshore Gon√¢ve Island, Matthew's strong winds destroyed the roofs of hundreds of homes and much of the island's roads and crops. Aftermath An American soldier delivers aid to a damaged village The destructive effects of Hurricane Matthew left about 12.9% of Haiti's population - 1.4 million people - in need of humanitarian assistance, of whom about 40% were children and another 40% were women of reproductive age. It was the largest disaster in the country since the 2010 earthquake. Within six days of the storm's landfall, 175,509 people were residing in 224 temporary shelters, as people left their damaged houses for safety. There were reports that the shelters had insufficient water or food. Thousands of children were separated from their parents after the hurricane or were living in orphanages, lacking basic necessities. At least 2,000 of these children were evacuated by Save the Children. The nearly- destroyed city of J√©r√©mie remained inaccessible to humanitarian aid groups for four days, lacking water and with little food for five days. Ganthier near the eastern border with the Dominican Republic suffered famine-like conditions and little water access in the aftermath of the hurricane. The price of rice and tin rose after the storm, leaving poor residents unable to afford food in areas that did not receive supplies. Damaged infrastructure and blocked roads prevented more expedient distribution of relief supplies, leaving storm victims without food or assistance for up to two weeks in isolated areas. By October 20, nearly 806,000 people were facing critical food shortages. Interim Haitian President Jocelerme Privert declared three days of national mourning, beginning on October 9. On the previous day, the country's travel ban by water was lifted, and communications were generally restored with the southwestern portion of the country. The Digicel network had restored 98% of the cellular network by October 15, including much of the worst hit areas. Within two weeks of the hurricane landfall, schools began to be reopened, and roads were gradually restored, which allowed for easier travel for humanitarian groups. By October 21, 80% of affected communities had road access restored. Based on the heavy storm damage, the Haitian government received over $20 million from the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility Segregated Portfolio Company, which provides disaster insurance for nations in the Caribbean. =U.S Aid assistance= Service members from Joint Task Force Matthew and representatives from the United States Agency of International Development delivered relief supplies to areas affected by Hurricane Matthew to Jeremie, Haiti On October 3, the Haitian government requested emergency assistance from the United Nations and other international agencies. On the same day, the International Charter Space and Major Disasters was activated, allowing charitable organizations to use satellite data for their relief work. Due to the hurricane damage, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recommended extending the peacekeeping force at existing levels until April 2017, and the Security Council passed Resolution 2313 on October 13 to extend the mission. The Secretary-General visited Haiti on October 15, taking an aerial tour of the damage and meeting local officials. Eight days earlier, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund provided a grant of $5 million toward rebuilding efforts, and the WFP began sending out 551 tons of food. By October 13, the WFP and other non-government organizations distributed 1,540 tons of food to nearly 58,000 people. In Port-au-Prince, earthquake survivors in damaged camps received 8,000 emergency kits from the IOM, while the United Nations peacekeeping force helped clear roads. The United Nations Development Programme provided short-term jobs to 1,416 people in Grand-Go√¢ve to clear debris in their damaged villages, after 90% of people in the town lost their source of income. In the storm's aftermath, humanitarian agencies had about 400 operations throughout Haiti to provide relief to storm victims. Several non-government organizations worked to provide needs for storm victims, including ACTED, Action Against Hunger, All Hands Volunteers, CARE, Direct Relief, Lutheran World Relief, Mercy Corps, Oxfam, Plan International, Project HOPE, Tzu Chi, World Concern, and World Vision International. These agencies provided water, food, blankets, medicine, plastic sheets, and water chlorination tablets.    * Direct Relief sent 86 pallets of medical supplies to Haiti worth $13 million. Catholic Relief Services provided $5 million toward disaster relief. Relief agencies were concerned that the aid would not reach those most in need, and that reconstruction would not have input from local officials. By eight days after the storm, people began rebuilding their houses in Les Cayes and on the road west from the city, although the supplies were insufficient for the population. Concern Worldwide brought relief supplies to Gon√¢ve Island by boat, including tarps, blankets, and water tablets. To determine the scale of the damage, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency sent a team of six people assisting the efforts of the Emergency Operation Centre in J√©r√©mie and Les Cayes. The Pan American Health Organization sent six teams of health experts to the hardest hit areas, along with medicine and other supplies. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement approved an appeal of CHF5 million to help 13,500 families, sending its first flight of aid on October 9. Flooding rains affected Haiti on October 21, disrupting relief efforts. On October 9, the United Nations launched an emergency appeal for aid for the country, requesting nearly US$120 million to provide for the needs of the storm victims. Within ten days, governments and relief agencies had pledged US$40.1 million toward the recovery. The government of neighboring Dominican Republic provided wood, medicine, and mattresses, and asked that its citizens contribute what they can to the recovery. The island of Dominica donated US$100,000 to Haiti as well as the Bahamas, which was later struck by Matthew. The government of Venezuela sent two boats with 20 tons of supplies, including medicine, water, and food. Canada donated C$6.08 million in aid toward replenishing drinking water. The United States Navy sent three vessels to Haiti to help respond to the storm - the , , and the , the last of which functions as a hospital ship. The Mesa Verde, stationed off Haiti's southern coast, had personnel and supplies for areas inaccessible by road. Due to improved road access and logistical support, the American military finished their operations by October 21\\\\. In total, the American government provided $37.9 million to fund its efforts in the country. The first flight of American aid arrived in Port-au-Prince on October 8, beginning the transfer of 480 tons of supplies. Outside of the Americas, the European Union provided ‚Ç¨1.755 million in funds. The United Kingdom pledged ¬£8 million in funds toward providing temporary shelters that had equipment to purify water, as well as cholera prevention. Ireland provided ‚Ç¨1.7 million toward the recovery efforts. Two Dutch ships helped relief operations in areas inaccessible by road. France sent two reconnaissance helicopters to survey the affected areas, as well as two water purification systems capable of producing 66,000 gallons (250,000 litres) each per day, valued at ‚Ç¨814,000. The Spanish Red Cross sent 5 tons of relief supplies, Estonia donated ‚Ç¨50,000 to the WHO, and the Luxembourg Red Cross flew a team of disaster experts. Switzerland also flew a team of experts in shelter-building, security, and water restoration, allocating CHF2 million toward the project. Japan granted US$3 million and donated tents through its International Cooperation Agency. South Korea donated US$350,000, and the Singapore Red Cross provided US$30,000 toward medicine and water. Australia donated A$3.5 million to UNICEF and the IOM. =Health and cholera outbreak= The ongoing cholera outbreak worsened following the storm, with 1,351 new cases reported by October 21. The storm destroyed 34 cholera treatment centers nationwide, including about 75% of such facilities in Grand'Anse and Sud departments. By October 10, Haitian doctors warned of a \\"Cholera crisis\\" in the hurricane's wake. In Port-a-Piment, at least 60 people were treated for the disease, with 4 dying from it. The town's hospital nearly ran out of supplies by this time. In the nearby village of Randel, more than 100 people were infected and at least 25 succumbed to the illness. The Port-Salut hospital received around 100 patients in the days after the storm, 85% of whom due to storm-related injuries. It recorded its first cholera death from the storm on October 9, as reports of the disease increased in the nation. The roads around St. Boniface Hospital in Sud, which has a cholera treatment center, were washed out, making it difficult for the hospital to get supplies. In addition to facing the cholera spread, health officials also worked to contain the Zika outbreak in the aftermath of the storm's flooding. Relief organizations sent doctors and medical teams to take care of medical needs, including treating for cholera. By October 20, M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res had provided medical care for 1,614 people. Civil Protection officials advised residents to only drink treated water, due to the potential for disease spreading by water. The Pan American Health Organization sent epidemiologists to monitor and mitigate the spread of cholera following the storm. The World Health Organization flew around 1 million anti-cholera vaccines to the country. On October 9, the United Nations transferred $8 million to UNICEF toward preventing the spread of disease. A week later, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon established the UN Haiti Cholera Response Multi-Partner Trust Fund, which provided and managed resources toward fighting cholera. A team from the Association of Medical Doctors of Asia assisted the hospital in Moron, Grand'Anse.

History A church at the site was first erected between 1576 and 1583, as an ex voto following the ebbing of a plague. It was patronized by the Confraternity of San Sebastiano and consecrated by the Bishop of Agrigento. During this period, it served as the main church, or Chiesa Matrice of the town, a role now encompassed by San Pancrazio. By the 18th century, this church had followed into near ruin, and construction of the present layout began in 1770 and was completed in 1782. It is dedicated to St Diego de Alcal√° (San Diego de Alcal√°). It became a parish church in 1933. The sandstone fa√ßade, dating to 1865, has a statue of San Diego within a niche. The belltower was erected in 1880 and is capped by a maiolica tiled dome. The interior has three naves, and was decorated (1791) with stucco. The chapel of the Holy Spirit, once the main chapel, was refurbished after a fire in 1932. The interior contains frescoes by the studio of Guadagnino brothers in the ceilings near the entrance, depicting the Noah giving thanks after the Flood, the Sacrifice of Isaac, and San Diego and the Virgin intercede with Jesus for the city of Canicatt√¨. The second chapel on the right has a canvas depicting The Virgin tends for the Souls in Purgatory attributed to Pietro Guadagnino, while in the left nave are two canvases depicting Pentecost and St Alfonso Maria De Liguori attributed to Francesco Guadagnino.

The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. The only episode of 2016, it stars Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor, and is the first to feature Nardole (Matt Lucas), who was introduced in the previousChristmas 2015episode \\"The Husbands of River Song\\", as his companion. The episode is set in New York City, and involves the Doctor and Nardole linking with journalist Lucy Fletcher (Charity Wakefield) and a superhero called The Ghost (Justin Chatwin) to combat brain- swapping aliens. Plot In New York City on Christmas Eve of 1992, an 8-year-old boy named Grant wakes to find the Twelfth Doctor dangling outside the window of his family's apartment and helps him come into his bedroom. Taking Grant to the rooftop, the Doctor (whom Grant calls \\"Doctor Mysterio\\") reveals he accidentally set off a trap for a device he was building, and he enlists Grant to help complete it. However, Grant mistakenly swallows a wish- granting gemstone needed for the device, believing it to be medicine, effectively being granted his wish to be a superhero. Abandoning the device, the Doctor makes Grant promise to not use his new superpowers before he leaves. The Doctor returns to New York in 2016 with Nardole, whom he removed from Hydroflax's body and rebuilt, to investigate Harmony Shoals, a multinational research company. They encounter a news reporter, Lucy Fletcher, who is conducting a similar investigation. The group discovers that it is being secretly run by a group of living alien brains that transplant themselves into any living creature they need for their plans. They witness the killing of the company's owner, Mr Brock, for his body. Tracked down by Dr Sim, an employee the brains already took over, the group is suddenly rescued by a masked superhero named the Ghost, who afterwards transports Lucy close to her home. Returning to her apartment before her, the Ghost transforms back into Grant, who works for Lucy as a nanny. He is shocked to find the Doctor and Nardole waiting for him, having tracked him down via the gemstone fused inside his body. When Lucy returns and interrogates the Time Lord by squeezing a stress toy she calls \\"Mr. Huffle\\", the Doctor reveals to her that the alien brains colonise planets by taking control of their prominent leaders, with Earth being their next target. Leaving Lucy to prepare for an interview with Grant's alter ego, the Doctor and Nardole track down the alien's ship in a low orbit and board it via the TARDIS. There, they discover that the ship's reactor is in a critical state and realise from Dr Sim that he intends to drop it on New York. Remembering an observation made by Nardole, the Doctor realises the city would be vaporised except for the Harmony Shoals building. World leaders would then take shelter in the company's other buildings within each capital city, believing Earth was under attack, effectively allowing the brains to take them over. After Dr Sim lets slip the ship is to be dropped at a designated time, the Doctor forces its descent ahead of schedule. The costumes of Nardole, The Doctor, The Ghost and Lucy in this episode, on display at the Doctor Who Experience. Ghost and Lucy are captured by the brains during the interview. They plan to transplant themselves into Ghost's body. Ghost flees to deprive the brains of their prize, then returns as Grant to protect Lucy. Unable to change the ship's course during its descent, the Doctor sends Grant a message requesting his help. Grant manages to stop the alien's ship from crashing into the city, but reveals himself as the Ghost to Lucy in the process. Lucy is won over and Grant takes her in tow as he disposes of the ship. The Doctor alerts UNIT, which shuts down Harmony Shoals, unaware that the alien brain in Dr Sims has escaped within one of their soldiers. Back at Lucy's apartment, Grant informs the Doctor he will no longer use his powers and retire his costumed identity. As the Time Lord leaves, Lucy asks him why he is sad. The Doctor gives only a vague answer before departing. Nardole privately reveals that the Doctor is mourning the loss of River Song, but will ultimately recover. He leaves with the Doctor to assist him further. =Continuity= At the beginning of the episode, the Doctor is constructing a device to reverse the paradoxes created during his previous visit in \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\" (2012). The Doctor mentions that he usually gets \\"an invasion\\" every Christmas, a reference to the different invasions of Earth taking place during most Doctor Who Christmas specials. The unnamed brain- swapping aliens last appeared in the 2015 Christmas special \\"The Husbands of River Song\\", where they were servants of King Hydroflax. Their main agent, Scratch, stated that they represented \\"the Shoal of the Winter Harmony.\\" The Doctor tells Lucy that he works for Scotland Yard, which he also did in \\"The Woman Who Lived\\" (2015). Previously, the Tenth Doctor told the guests at Lady Eddison's manor he was a chief inspector from Scotland Yard in \\"The Unicorn and the Wasp\\" (2008), while the Eleventh Doctor told President Richard Nixon he was an undercover operative from Scotland Yard (code-named \\"The Doctor\\") in \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\" (2011). A cinema near Lucy's apartment features a film called The Mind of Evil, the name of a Third Doctor serial. Nardole mentions that the Doctor cut him out of Hydroflax's body, referring to off- screen events following \\"The Husbands of River Song\\" where he was decapitated and his head was placed inside the artificially intelligent robotic body of King Hydroflax. When the Doctor complains that Grant promised him never to use his powers, Nardole brings up the Time Lord policy of never interfering with other peoples or cultures, first mentioned in the Second Doctor serial The War Games (1969). When clearing out the headquarters of Harmony Shoal, a UNIT officer prepares to contact Osgood, referring to Petronella Osgood who previously appeared in \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013), \\"Death in Heaven\\" (2014) and \\"The Zygon Invasion\\" / \\"The Zygon Inversion\\" (2015). Both the Doctor and Nardole refer to the final 24-year night the Doctor spent with River Song (\\"The Husbands of River Song\\") and her eventual death in the Library (\\"Forest of the Dead\\"). =Outside references= The character of \\"The Ghost\\" is a pastiche of the comic book superhero Superman, with several references to the character being made throughout the special: * Superman's creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, are referenced when Mr Brock directs the gathered reporters to ask further questions of \\"Miss Shuster and Ms. Siegel\\". * Grant has roughly the same standard powers of Superman, including flight, super-strength, super-speed, being bulletproof, and possessing X-ray vision, along with other unconventional powers. He gains his abilities from a stellar-powered object (a gemstone made from a star, in the episode), much as Superman gains his from Earth's yellow sun. * The Harmony Shoals building in New York featured in the episode has a large globe on top of it, making it resemble the Daily Planet building, a major setting of Superman stories. * Grant prefers being called \\"mild-mannered\\", as Superman's alter ego is often characterized. He also follows the same moral code as Superman when operating as the Ghost, and transforms in a similar fashion by tearing open his shirt to reveal his superhero costume underneath. * The special features a number of elements that mimic those from Richard Donner's Superman: The Movie. One scene involves the Ghost voicing his hope that Lucy's close call at Harmony Shoal hasn't put her off journalism, paralleling the same scene in the film in which Superman hopes Lois is not put off from flying after he rescues her from falling out of a helicopter. Lucy also conducts a rooftop interview with the Ghost reminiscent of Lois' interview with Superman in the film. * Lucy Fletcher is named after Lois Lane's sister Lucy. Her character is similar to Lois' in that she does not realize that her old high school friend and current nanny is the superhero Ghost. The initials \\"L.L.\\" used by several characters of the Superman comics (including Lois Lane, Lana Lang, Lex Luthor, Linda Lee, Lori Lemaris, Letitia Lerner, Lena Luthor and Lyla Lerrol) is used in Lucy's married name: Lucy Lombard. Several characters from Marvel Comics decorate the walls of young Grant's bedroom. The Doctor questions Spider-Man's unusual origin of being bitten by a radioactive spider; he opines that radiation poisoning would be the likely result. A \\"Joe's Pizza\\" is shown within the city, which is where Peter Parker worked briefly in the movie Spider-Man 2. The Doctor counsels Grant that \\"with great power comes great responsibility,\\" an adage associated with Spider-Man. Batman is briefly referenced after the Ghost drops Lucy off at her apartment building. When the baby monitor he is carrying goes off, Lucy mistakes it for a signal device and asks if the Bat- Signal is now an app. The Doctor uses the augmented reality game app Pok√©mon Go to create a distraction at Harmony Shoal's Tokyo headquarters.

Andrew Billen writing in The Times gave the programme four stars out of a possible five. Billen said that Capaldi was at his warmest and that Nardole (Matt Lucas) \\"added panto brio to an already exuberant episode\\". The Guardian gave a positive review of The Return of Doctor Mysterio saying \\"Capaldi takes Manhattan!\\" ... \\"Cosmic baddies are inserting alien brains into world leaders‚Äô heads in the Christmas special. It‚Äôs timely, top-of-the-tree fun ‚Äì and Peter Capaldi and Matt Lucas are a pantomime treat\\". IGN said \\"‚ÄúThe Return of Doctor Mysterio‚Äù is a pretty lightweight entry in the Twelfth Doctor‚Äôs oeuvre, which considering the events of last season isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. But the different elements of the episode don‚Äôt come together as smoothly as they could, and the emotional through line for the Doctor is treated mostly as an afterthought\\" but gave it 7.0 out of 10. The A.V. Club gave a mixed review saying that \\"Doctor Who takes a jolly detour to superhero goofiness\\".

They came to Kerala fearing the assault of a ruler. In Kerala they were given land and status by Kaipuzha Thampan (Kunjunni Varma Thampan of Nilambur Kovilakam a landlord who lived in Amanthur Palace at Kaipuzha from Kottayam Kerala. Today Pandalam is part of Pathanamthitta, Kerala, India. Early history The Pandya Kingdom of Tamilakam was once attacked by Malik Kafur, the commander- in-chief of Alauddin Khalji of Khalji dynasty. Upon the failure of Pandiya rajas, two branches of this dynasty fled towards west (Kerala) to secure themselves from the attacks. One branch proceeded via the Western Ghats mountainous regions and settled in Poonjar in Kottayam and established the Poonjar kingdom. The other branch (Chembazhannur) wandered through several places ghatsand facing much difficulty finally settled in Pandalam. The fleeing Chembazhannur branch at first settled in Valliyur (near Tirunelveli) and enjoyed a privileged position in the society. Later due to the threats of invasion, the royal family shifted to Tenkasi. Thirumalai Nayak(Naykan), a famed ruler of Madurai wished to see his daughter's marriage with a prince of Chembazhannur family. But upon the rejection of marriage proposal, Nayak became an enemy of Pandiyas. He made huge damages in Tenkasi with his strong Maravappada (army). Knowing that they couldn't continue a peaceful life in Tenkasi, the family moved to a place named Elathoor maniyam and procured the mountainous regions near Puliyankudi. But Nayak continued to torture the royal family which forced them to proceed towards west (Kerala) via places such as Achankovil, Aryankavu, Kulathupuzha and settled in Konni by c. 79 ME, which was according to the Copper deed issued by the Venad raja. The family constructed a shrine for lord Shiva in Konni (Muringamangalam Sreemahadevar Temple) for their daily worships. This temple is one of the most noted contributions of Chembazhanuur family in Kerala. A number of Mutts, Manas and Koyikkalls were also constructed by the family. The local people fed up with the activities of thieves accepted the family as the ruling class which was named as Chembazhanji kovilakom. Attacks on Travancore by Cholas forced the family to flee Konni and then to settle down in Pandalam which became their permanent capital. A full-fledged kingdom was established by around ME (1194 CE) by obtaining the land from Kunjunni Varma Thampan (Kaipuzha Thampan) of Amanthur Kovilakam at Kaipuzha and the local ruler and landlord of the region. The Venad ruler also played a great role in the establishment of this kingdom. People enjoyed a peaceful atmosphere and ideal life under the Pandalam rulers. As of the Travancore state manual, Pandalam kingdom kept friendly relations with the rajas of Travancore. Relation between Kaipuzha Thampan and Maharaja of Travancore was extremely cordial.Pandhalam Raja establishd a good relation with Maharaj of Travancore through Kunjunni Varma Thampan who was the close friend, advisory of Maharaja of Travancore. The territories of Pandalam kingdom extended to an area of which covered the parts of Konni, Achankovil, Tenkasi and the forest regions of Sabarimala, the abode of Ayyayppa. During 345 ME, Aadhichavarman a Venad ruler had given a sizable portion of land to this kingdom. Marthanda Varma, the famed Venad ruler and establisher of Travancore kingdom (925 ME) was named for his annexation policies. But on his conquests in Central Travancore, Pandalam was left independent and wasn't annexed to his domain. This was primarily due to cordial relations that Travancore had with Pandalam and of the assistance by the royal family in the Kayamkulam conquest of Varma. Pandalam was forced to give a big amount of Rs.2,20,001 to Travancore government towards the cost of wars after Tippus conquest in Malabar coast during 965 ME. The amount was paid in various installments. During 969 ME, the income from Sabarimala temple was used to pay as installments by a ruler of Pandalam. By 995 ME, the raja of Travancore made an agreement with the Pandalam king assuring that they would support every member of the royal family if they were allowed to collect revenue from Pandalam. Upon the acceptance of this offer, the kingdom of Pandalam was merged with Travancore and a monthly pension was issued for each royal family member. The administrative rights of temples including Sabarimala within the premises of kingdom was transferred to the Travancore government and later to Travancore devaswom board. Before the formation of Pathanamthitta district, Pandalam was a part of the Mavelikkara taluk of Alappuzha district. Legend about the relationship with Ayyappa Sabarimala, the holy abode of Ayyappa It is believed that the royal family of Pandalam belonged to the Bhargava gotra while other royal families in Kerala were included in the Viswamitra gotra. The kingdom is famed for its kinship with Ayyappa, the son of Harihara (the fusion of Shiva and Vishnu). Raja Rajasekhara, a king of this dynasty during his hunting expedition heard the crying of a baby near the banks of Pamba. The raja found a glorious looking infant wearing a bead in his neck and surrounded by a halo. The childless raja was doubted whether to take the child with him. But Sage Agastya arrived there and cleared his doubts by telling him that the child is a boon from the Gods and advised him to accept him. He was named Manikanta (Mani means bead and Kanta being the neck). He was given proper education in gurukulam Later Rani gave birth to a son but raja considered Manikanta as his elder son and decided to crown him as Yuvaraja of Pandalam. Manikanta was not willing to take up the throne as he was destined to crush evil. A greedy minister in the court misled the rani of the palace and partake in his scheme against Manikanta. Following the words of the minister, the rani pretended to be affected by a severe stomachache. The bribed royal physician prescribed the milk of Tiger as the only cure for this ache. The king was quite sure that none of the royal servants could complete the mission of obtaining milk from a tiger, but Manikanta agreed to go deep into the forests to fetch it. In the forests, Manikanta would come to fight and vanquish the demoness Mahishi. On the very next day, he arrived at the palace riding a tiger followed by a group of cubs. Realizing that Manikanta was not an ordinary being, the members of the palace began praising him by calling him Ayyane and Appane, from which the name \\"Ayyappa\\" originated. As his mission of slaying the demoness Mahishi was fulfilled, Manikanta determined that he should leave the palace, not before instructing the raja to construct a shrine at Sabarimala where he would be presiding to bless thousands of devotees. He blessed everyone who assembled there once this was done and vanished forever. The above verses show the relationship of Lord Ayyappa with the Pandiya kingdom. He is often depicted as the Thilak (a mark on the forehead) of the Pandiya vamsa and the beloved deity of Kerala nadu. The Palace complex Pandalam palace () is a royal palace of Pandalam located on the banks of Achankovil river was the residence of royal family members. The architectural mixtures of both Pandyas and Keralites can be witnessed in any corner of the palace. Mud, bamboo, stone and wood are the mostly used construction components in the old structures. It was in this palace that lord Ayyappa spent his childhood. In course of time, Many parts of the palace was took away by minor conflagrations and floods. But quite a few structures like Valiyakoikkal temple, Kaipuzha temple and Thevarappura remains still which depicts the ancient history and archaeological importance. =Valiyakoikkal temple= Pandalam Valiyakoikkal Sastha temple The temple situated on the banks of Achankovil river was the family temple of Pandalam kingdom, built in the traditional architectural styles of Kerala. It was built by Rajasekhara raja after returning from Sabarimala for daily worships of Ayyappa. The shrine is placed within the palace premises. A Salagramam (sacred stone) is installed here instead of an idol. The holy Thiruvabharanam procession to Sabarimala begins from this temple every year on 28th of dhanu before the Makaravilakku festival hosted in the month of Makaram. =Kaipuzha temple= There are mainly two shrine in this complex, one for Shiva under the palace administration other for Krishna managed by Travancore devaswom board. The Navagraha (nine holy planets) sculptures are portrayed in the shrine of Krishna. Once the idol of Narasimha Murthy was installed in the temple which was very powerful. But due to the unfortunate incidents in the palace, the idol was replaced by the Santhana gopalam pratishta as per the instructions of astrologers and priests. =Thevarappuras (prayer rooms)= Kochukoikkal thevarappura The prayer rooms or Thevarappuras of both Vadakkekottaram and Nalukettu palaces structured elegantly in wood are still in unblemished condition which keeps the idols of 28 gods and goddess for worshipping. The Pandiyan relation of Pandalam kingdom can easily be noticed from the presence of Minakshi amman idol. =Srampical palace= The palace is placed in the north of Valiyakoikkal temple. The Thiruvabharanam (sacred ornaments) of lord Ayyappa are kept here. Pilgrims have the opportunity to worship the ornaments and to view the holy palanquin at times of Mandala - Makaravilakku period. These ornaments are taken out on the morning of 28th Dhanu then moved to the temple and later to Sabarimala temple in a holy procession. =Puthenkoikkal= This building is situated near a pond. The pond was once meant for bathing purposes of ladies in the palace. The raja on his way to Sabarimala with the sacred ornaments used to halt at this palace to receive the Vibhuti and blessings of Valiya thamburatti (senior most female member). Customs and beliefs in the palace The palace itself keeps a number of varied customs and beliefs as sacred. The royal family had the privileges to perform various ritual practices at Valiyakoikkal and Sabarimala temples. Devotees often visits the raja to obtain the blessings in the form of Vibhuti (sacred ash). =Some important customs= * The Valiya Thampuran has the privilege of being the last to pray at the Sabarimala shrine on Makaravilakku day * The male children (before upanayana) and female members (age 10-50) are not allowed to undertake the holy pilgrimage. * The royal members need not carry the Irumudikettu (travel kit) along with them on the Sabarimala pilgrimage. * The Valiyakoikkal temple will be closed for 12 days upon the demise of any family member of the Palace. Notable personalities The royal family of Pandalam has renowned artists, scholars and men of letters. =Pandalam Kerala Varma= Pandalam Kerala Varma is a writer. He wrote many narrative poems, translations, children's poetry and two mahakavyas. He served as the chief editor of \\"Kavana Kaumudi\\", the first Malayalam periodical. =V.S Valiathan= V.S.

Now in the collection of the Minnesota Historical Society. Redwork is a form of American embroidery, also called art needlework, that developed in the 19th century and was particularly popular between 1855 and 1925. It traditionally uses red thread, chosen because red dyes were the first commercially available colorfast dyes, in the form of Turkey red embroidery floss. Redwork designs are composed of simple stitches and were mainly used to decorate household objects in the 19th and 20th centuries, especially quilts. Patterns for individual quilt blocks were sold for a penny in the United States, making them popular and affordable. In the 21st century, redwork has seen a resurgence among crafters. The main stitch used in redwork is backstitch or outline stitching, formerly known as Kensington stitch. Redwork was a common introductory form of embroidery taught to children in the 19th and 20th century. Children would make quilts decorated with redwork motifs, with motifs of various sizes prior to approximately 1910 and uniform sizes after that year. It was also a way for women with skills in pattern stamping or embroidery to generate their own source of income from the home. The motifs used in redwork were specific to the item embroidered: water motifs would be used on backsplash cloths, the words \\"good night\\" and \\"good morning\\" used on quilts, and chairs on upholstered items. The most popular designs found in early redwork (prior to 1900) include Japanese inspired imagery, children, toys, animals and insects, and elaborately-coiffed women, some of which were adapted from designs made for crazy quilts. After the turn of the 20th century, Beatrix Potter characters and animals were the most popular. In the 1910s, tea-towel motifs were adapted into redwork designs, including calendrical themes and kitchenware. The following decade saw the predominance of state birds and state flowers.

The rock, also known as Jacuba Menor, rises to an elevation of . The rock face is about high, and has thousands of boulders at its base. It provides challenging routes for climbers, who may reach the base via well maintained trails from the Abrigo do Elefante site at Kilometer 2 on the Taquaril road. Hazards include loose stones, hawks, swallows, snakes, racoons and, according to legend, an ocelot. The site in 2013 was suffering from deforestation and use of pesticides by local landowners. History The Pedra do Elefante Natural Monument was created by municipal decree in May 2010. The board was to consist of ten government representatives and ten representatives of civil society. It is classed as a fully protected conservation unit. It is administered by the municipal Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable Development. It was included in the Central Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest Mosaic, which had been created in December 2006.

Solyankin led the 2nd Tank Division during the Battle of Raseiniai, a Soviet counterattack after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. He was killed in action during the defeat of his division.  Early life  Solyankin was born on 21 April 1901Irretrievable loss report, available online at obd-memorial.ru in Moscow. He was orphaned at age four and was sent to be raised in a peasant family in a village in Gzhatsky Uyezd. Solyankin was a shepherd in the village. From the age of twelve he worked as a blacksmith in Moscow. In June 1920, he was drafted into the Red Army.  Military career  Solyankin, originally an infantryman, transferred to armor in 1932. In 1936, he served as commander of a tank battalion of the 1st Kazan Rifle Division. From July 1938, he commanded the 2nd Tank Brigade in the Leningrad Military District. Solyankin became commander of the 18th Light Tank Brigade in 1939, when it was stationed in Estonia at Uuem√µisa as a result of the Soviet‚ÄìEstonian Mutual Assistance Treaty, and participated in the Soviet annexation of Estonia in June 1940. During the annexation, the brigade advanced into Tallinn. On 4 June 1940, he was promoted to Major General.Resolution No. 945 of the Council of the People's Commissars of the USSR He then served as deputy commander of the 1st Mechanized Corps. Solyankin became commander of the 2nd Tank Division, part of the 3rd Mechanized Corps, on 9 December. In the early summer of 1941 he arranged for the evacuation of the families of officers, although this was not officially permitted. = World War II = During the invasion of Russia, the 3rd Mechanized Corps mounted a counterattack against the advancing XXXXI Panzer Corps in what became known as the Battle of Raseiniai. The 2nd Tank Division had marched a hundred kilometers from Kƒódainiai on 23 June to make its planned assault the following day. The division had six different types of tanks, including 32 KV-1s, 19 KV-2s, and 50 T-34s. Nearly half of the KVs broke down during the march. The KV tanks and T-34s of the division surprised the troops of the 6th Panzer Division, who were unaware of the existence of the Soviet tanks. The attack caused temporary panic, but the German forces counterattacked when the 2nd Tank Division ran out of fuel and ammunition after making six attacks. The 1st Panzer Division and the 36th Infantry Division flanked Solyankin's division and its rear area was captured after the 8th Panzer Division took Kƒódainiai. On 25 June, Solyankin led a breakout attempt with the remaining heavy tanks leading. The division was destroyed and Solyankin was killed on 26 June. The location of his burial is unknown. He was survived by his wife, Varvara Vasilievna, a daughter, Raisa, and a son, Alexander.

Chaba also caused 7 deaths in the country. Typhoon Chaba was the eighteenth named storm and the eighth typhoon of the 2016 Pacific typhoon season. Meteorological history On September 26, a tropical depression developed approximately 1,445 km (898 mi) east- northeast of Guam. Despite a marginally favorable environment, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system to a tropical storm and assigned it the name Chaba late the next day. Early on September 28, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) gave the identifier of 21W. Flaring convection and improved overall convective structure prompted the JTWC to upgrade it to a tropical storm. By September 30, Chaba had intensified into a severe tropical storm after deep convection had evolved into a banding feature and very favorable conditions such as very low wind shear and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of about 30 degrees Celsius. On October 1, Chaba entered the Philippine area of responsibility, with PAGASA assigning the local name Igme, as it started to move in a northwestward direction. Several hours later, both agencies upgraded Chaba to a typhoon after its organization and structure had vastly improved. During the next day, Chaba became more symmetric as feeder bands wrapped into its deep central convection, signalling the onset of explosive intensification. Continuing its strengthening trend, Chaba reached Category 5 super typhoon intensity with a sharp wide eye surrounded by a very intense convective core due to very warm SSTs. On October 3, Chaba reached its peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 280 km/h (175 mph), and a minimum central pressure of 905 mbar. Thereafter, the JTWC stated that Chaba began weakening, as its core became asymmetric, and Chaba weakened to a strong Category 4 typhoon by October 4. Later, significant weakening led the JTWC to downgrade Chaba further to a Category 2 typhoon, due to interaction with strong north- northeasterly winds. At 10:00 a.m. KST (01:00 UTC), Chaba struck Geojedo and then made landfall in Busan an hour later with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). At that time, Chaba started to undergo extratropical transition and the JTWC issued its final advisory a few hours later, while downgrading the system to a tropical storm. At the same time, the JMA downgraded Chaba to a severe tropical storm. Six hours later, the JMA issued its final advisory, as Chaba became extratropical. Preparations and impact EVA Air and China Airlines canceled flights to Okinawa that had been scheduled for 3 October, which was the day the typhoon was forecast to impact Okinawa. EVA Air had previously been criticized for operating flights to destinations affected by typhoons a week earlier, when Typhoon Megi was affecting the region. The storm left widespread damage across the southern regions of South Korea, killing at least 7 and leaving 3 missing. Transportation was disrupted, with hundreds of flights canceled, while more than 220,000 households lost electricity. Chaba was the strongest typhoon to strike the country since Sanba in 2012, and was the strongest October typhoon to hit Korea, establishing a new record for rainfall rate on Jeju Island. Flooding was also reported in the southern South Korea cities of Ulsan, Gyeongju, and Busan. Damages were reported at billion (US$129 million).

This reference, Roland Champagne argues, reflects a kinship between the Anti-Oedipus authors' view of the self as a \\"desiring machine\\" and Sollers's desire to parody the \\"texts which create the self and thereby produce mirror-images of the self as it is reflected in the languages of culture.\\" H is characterized by Sollers's preoccupation with Joyce's Finnegans Wake, a book that provides Sollers an example of \\"a true subversion of language and a profound historical vision.\\" H also reveals Sollers's interest in Ezra Pound's work, \\"the epic thrust through time and across space.\\" Sollers had written in Tel Quel that he needed a \\"rhythm that reflects the tangle of social relationships.\\" Roland Champagne, in his book on Sollers, writes \\"for this, he need[ed] a new form that will allow the spoken word to provide such a complex voicing, without the hindrances of formal written structure with its paragraphs, capitalization, and punctuation. David Hayman wrote that H was a departure for Sollers in that \\"[i]t is the first of Sollers's books to have frequent glimmers of humor ... and the first to come to its public, as did the Wake, without an explicit ‚Äòkey,‚Äô a preliminary road map. The reader must chart his own H space and time, carve out chunks of H meaning, and supply punctuation and emphases.‚Äù Hayman goes on to distinguish H from its antecedents such as Finnegans Wake: \\"While the Wake has strong, if hidden, elements of plot and character, and a coherent and systematic development, there is no plot line in H or Paradis. If there are personalities, there are no personae. Instead we have the overarching person (sujet) of the writer imposing itself discreetly through its rhythms upon a vision of history as process, or rather of historical flux.‚Äù Reception French literary critic Roland Barthes grouped H with three other books by Sollers, Drame, Paradis, and Lois, and described these four as books that > have to be referred to as novels because there is no other term to designate > them. But they do not tell stories, describe a particular society or present > identifiable characters. They are texts of which language itself is the > subject, language which is wholly free from the duty to describe. The world > which these texts presents is not one which the reader could either identify > as her own or see clearly as different from it. In the past, in Barthes's > view it was the author's duty to describe such a world which held language > unjustifiably captive. One of the reasons he writes with such enthusiasm > about Sollers is the way in which texts such as Paradis and Lois show what > happens when this duty is removed. Philip Barnard and Cheryl Lester also viewed H as a turning point in Sollers's work, while also acknowledging its clear antecedents in the work of authors like Joyce and Faulkner: > Without yet returning to plot and character, the novels H (1973) and Paradis > (1981) transform the discrete segments and pronounced architecture of the > earlier works into a continuous, unpunctuated flow of rhythmic prose. With > these two novels, Sollers achieved a tour de force of modernist poetics > whose clear precedents are Joyce and Faulkner. The powerful narrative voice > that emerges in these works foregrounds song, chant, psalmody, and real > rhythms that point toward their sources in sacred texts and Dantean epos. Driftless Area Review lauded H, stating \\"[a]long with Ulysses and Beckett‚Äôs Three Novels, H can take its place in the permanent avant-garde.\\" References Sources   * * Category:Novels by Philippe Sollers Category:1973 French novels ","title":"H (novel)"},{"id":"51895858","text":"Crispin Mulumba Lukoji (5 March 1943 ‚Äì 3 March 1997), was a Congolese politician.

The film, directed and written by Angela Robinson, stars Luke Evans as Marston, Rebecca Hall as his legal wife Elizabeth and Bella Heathcote as the Marstons' polyamorous life partner, Olive Byrne. JJ Feild, Oliver Platt and Connie Britton also feature. The film premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival and was released in the United States on October 13, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised Robinson's direction and the performances of its stars.  Plot  The story is told in flashbacks set during a 1945 testimony that William Moulton Marston gives to representatives of the Child Study Association of America. In the year 1928, William and his wife Elizabeth teach and work on their research at the associated Harvard and Radcliffe Colleges. One day, William hires one of his students, Olive Byrne as a research assistant. Olive aids in the Marstons' work in inventing the lie detector and conducting research on William's DISC theory on human interactions, and the three soon grow close. One after another, tests by the lie detector reveal that they have fallen in love with one another, and all three of them begin to engage in a polyamorous relationship. As word about their unconventional relationship gets out, the Marstons are fired from the university. Olive reveals that she is pregnant and moves in with the Marstons shortly after. The trio decides to build a family together and create a fabrication to keep secret the nature of their relationship. The family settles in a New York suburb, happily together. By 1934, both Elizabeth and Olive bear children by William (Olive has two sons and Elizabeth has one son and one daughter), telling the neighbors that Olive is a widow and taken in by the Marstons. William starts trying to make a living as an author. Elizabeth takes a job as a secretary and becomes the main breadwinner of the family. Olive stays at home and takes care of the kids, occasionally submitting her writing samples to publishers. They raise their four children together, and Elizabeth names her daughter after Olive. In 1940, William stumbles upon a lingerie shop in New York City run by Charles Guyette, who introduces him to fetish art themed comics and photos. The art captures William's imagination as a demonstration of his DISC theory. Elizabeth initially disapproves of the art, but she relents during a presentation wherein Olive tries out an outfit that later would be the prototype for Wonder Woman's costume. After finding limited work as a writer, Marston comes up with the idea of creating a female Amazonian super-heroine for a comic book. The comic would feature his ideas on DISC theory, drawing inspiration from the Marstons' work on the lie detector as well as Elizabeth and Olive in real life, and intend to support the feminist movement to further equal rights for women through a populist medium. He pitches his ideas to Max Gaines, a publisher at National Periodical Publications, who ultimately accepts the comic and suggests simplifying the female superhero's name to \\"Wonder Woman\\". Wonder Woman is an instant hit, leading to prosperity for the Marstons/Byrne family. However, one day, their neighbor wanders into their home and witnesses the three of them having sex. This incident leads to their children getting bullied and asked to leave school by the staff. Worried about their children being attacked and ostracized and thinking they have no other choice, Elizabeth reluctantly demands that Olive leave the household with her children. At the same time, the Wonder Woman comic receives accusations of featuring overtly sexual, sadomasochistic, and lesbian imagery that leads to the testimony of the present day. Leaving the testimony, William collapses and is rushed to the hospital. Learning that he is dying of cancer, William asks Olive to see him and Elizabeth again, trying to help them reconcile. William persuades Elizabeth to submit to Olive as she should not always dominate in their relationship. The Marstons get on their knees and beg for Olive's forgiveness, and Elizabeth tearfully admits that she cannot live without Olive. She eventually agrees to come back to them. Epilogue text reveals that William died in 1947. Elizabeth and Olive continued to live together as a couple for another 38 years until Olive's death in 1985, and Elizabeth lived to be 100. It also notes that sexual imagery disappeared from the Wonder Woman comic after William's death, along with Wonder Woman's superpowers. Wonder Woman was finally reclaimed by famous activist Gloria Steinem in 1972, when she put the character on the cover of the first issue of Ms. Magazine as the quintessential symbol of female empowerment.

The process assumes that early ventures have untested hypotheses about their business model (who are the customers, what features they want, what channel to use, revenue strategy/pricing tactics, how to get/keep/grow customers, strategic activities needed to deliver the product, internal resources needed, partners needed and costs). Customer development starts with the key idea that there are no facts inside your building so get outside to test them. The hypotheses testing emulates the scientific method ‚Äì pose a business model hypothesis, design an experiment, get out of the building and test it. Take the data and derive some insight to either (1) Validate the hypothesis, (2) Invalidate the Hypothesis, or (3) Modify the hypothesis. Many burgeoning startup companies devote all of their efforts to designing and refining their product and very little time ‚Äúgetting out of the building.‚Äù The customer development model encourages that more time be spent in the field identifying potential consumers and learning how to better meet their needs. The Customer Development concept emphasizes empirical research. Customer development is the opposite of the ‚Äúif we build it, they will come‚Äù product development-centered strategy, which is full of risks and can ultimately be the downfall of a company. The customer development method was created by Steve Blank,. According to Blank, startups are not simply smaller versions of larger, more developed companies. A startup operates in a fashion vastly different from that of a large company and employs different methods. While larger companies execute known and proven business strategies, startups must search for new business models. Customer Development guides the search for a repeatable and scalable business model.  History Customer development was developed by Blank in the 1990s. While writing about his experiences as an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley for his memoir, Blank began to notice patterns in the startups he was involved with. Recognizing that startups are not simply smaller versions of large companies, he observed that entrepreneurs need to have a systemized approach to guide their search for ‚Äúrepeatable and scalable business models.‚Äù The revelation led to his first book, The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win, which served as the course text for his first class and heralded the birth of Customer Development, which in turn spawned the Lean Startup movement. Blank's second book, The Startup Owner‚Äôs Manual, is a guide to building a startup using customer development principles.  The four-step process The customer development method consists of four steps that are designed to help avoid common pitfalls and repeat successful business strategies: * Customer discovery first captures the founders‚Äô vision and turns it into a series of business model hypotheses. Then it develops a plan to test customer reactions to those hypotheses and turn them into facts. * Customer validation tests whether the resulting business model is repeatable and scalable. If not, founders should return to customer discovery. * Customer creation is the start of execution. It builds end-user demand and drives it into the sales channel to scale the business. * Company building transitions the organization from a startup to a company focused on executing a validated model.  Customer Development Manifesto The Customer Development Manifesto from The Startup Owner's Manual, written by Blank and Bob Dorf: # There Are No Facts Inside Your Building, So Get Outside # Pair Customer Development with Agile Development # Failure is an Integral Part of the Search # Make Continuous Iterations and Pivots # No Business Plan Survives First Contact with Customers So Use a Business Model Canvas # Design Experiments and Test to Validate Your Hypothesis # Agree on Market Type. It Changes Everything # Startup Metrics Differ from Those in Existing Companies # Fast Decision-Making, Cycle Time, Speed and Tempo # It's All About Passion # Startup Job Titles Are Very Different from a Large Company's # Preserve All Cash Until Needed. Then Spend. # Communicate and Share Learning # Customer Development Success Begins With Buy-In  Teachings Blank began teaching Customer Development in his entrepreneurship classes at Stanford University and UC Berkeley. His class, the Lean Launchpad, was first taught has been adopted by more than 75 universities around the globe. In 2011, Blank's curriculum became the new standard for science commercialization in the U.S. as the National Science Foundation adopted it for their Innovation Corps.  Business model From the customer development view, a business model is a representation of how organizations create, deliver and capture value. It is designed to change rapidly, reflect customer reality and iterate as new information is discovered. The business model is based on the mantra, ‚ÄúNo business plan survives first contact with customers.‚Äù The business plan is an operating document that existing companies write to execute known business models. However, for a startup, there are too many unknowns to develop a successful plan. The static business plan necessarily changes as soon as the business comes in contact with its target market. Startups are involved in searching for the right business model. The business model is tested in the real world (e.g., through a Minimum Viable Product) to gather customer input and make necessary changes. When a successful, repeatable business model is discovered, the company enters the product execution and business plan phase.  Business model canvas Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur designed the Business Model Canvas. The Canvas is a tool to help entrepreneurs structure and plan their business models. It is designed to change rapidly, highlight alternatives, promote a customer focus and encourage testing. It can also be used to set up Customer Development hypotheses and to visually track iterations. The business model canvas is made up of nine blocks: * Key partners * Key activities * Key resources * Value propositions * Customer relationships * Channels * Customer segments * Cost structure * Revenue streams Osterwalder and Blank have integrated both business model design and customer development hypotheses into the business model canvas. Each of the nine blocks corresponds to one or more Customer Development hypotheses. When a hypothesis is found to be incorrect, entrepreneurs can apply Customer Development strategies to turn the mistake into a Pivot. As a Pivot, a failed hypothesis becomes a learning strategy, and the business model can be rewritten.  Minimum viable product The minimum viable product (MVP) is ‚Äúthat version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customer with the least effort.‚Äù The startup releases the most minimal, core product to start testing early and minimize the total development process time. The MVP allows entrepreneurs to gather feedback from early adopters to prevent pitfalls and avoid building unwanted products. The MVP also lets customers point out missing features and necessary changes. To successfully use the MVP strategy, entrepreneurs must be committed to iteration. Customer feedback will bring the product or service through several changes before it is finalized.  Hypotheses Hypotheses are critical assumptions about how a business will work, and include assumptions about target market, pricing, and competitors. Together, hypotheses make up the business model for a startup. Testing hypotheses means that the founder has to ‚Äúget out of the building‚Äù and answer three questions about the business: # Do we really understand the customer's problem or need? # Do enough people care about the problem or need to deliver a huge business? # Will they care enough to tell their friends and grow the business quickly? Hypotheses can be tested in several ways. Creating an MVP is one way to quickly test mockups and ideas in the real world, especially with Web and mobile startups. Hypotheses change as a result of testing and customer feedback. The changed hypotheses are incorporated into new iterations of the startup business model.  Pivot The pivot is ‚Äúa structural course correction to test a new fundamental hypothesis about a product, strategy [or] engine of growth.‚Äù It is the process of changing a part or parts of the business model to reflect reality. The customer development process assumes that most of the initial assumptions of the business model will be wrong. Pivoting involves recognizing that the original business model is not working, then deciding what changes to make and taking action on those changes. This process is easier to visualize when the business model is drawn out. While iterating involves small changes like altering a product price, pivoting involves substantial changes like identifying a better target market. The process involves four steps: # Observe: Observing that the business model isn't working. # Orient: Orienting to the new facts. # Decide: Deciding what to change in the business model. # Act: Acting decisively to make the change. There are several examples of successful companies that pivoted early on, including Groupon, which famously pivoted from a failed social advocacy campaign into a billion dollar daily deal site, and Fab.com, which pivoted from a social network to a daily deal design site. Instagram pivoted from a mobile microblogging platform into a photo application.

Background In anticipation of the offensive, ISIL reinforced Dabiq with 800 fighters. An ISIL defeat at Dabiq was seen as a potential ideological blow since it has a central place in ISIL's interpretation of Muslim theology. According to ISIL, a battle at Dabiq between Islamic and \\"infidel\\" Christian forces would herald the beginning of the apocalypse. The beginning of the Turkish military intervention in Syria also correlates to the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Marj Dabiq, when the Ottoman Empire led by Selim I entered northern Aleppo at Dabiq and conquered much of northern Syria. The offensive =First week= Map of the offensive On 28 September, the Turkish military stated that it destroyed an ISIL command post, a weapons dump and an ammunition depot in the Ihtemlat and Uwayshiyyah areas of Aleppo Governorate, while 82 targets were struck by shells.

By this point, the rebel and Turkish force was some three kilometers from Dabiq. On 3 October, advancing rebel forces ran into hundreds of landmines at the village of Turkman Bareh, on the way to Dabiq, leaving 15‚Äì21 rebels dead and another 29‚Äì35 wounded.50 rebels killed or wounded by IS landmines in Turkman Bareh Between 4 and 5 October, rebels captured Turkman Bareh and five more villages, including three to the east of Akhtarin.

According to the Turkish military, 38 ISIL militants were killed in clashes and airstrikes during 8 to 9 October. Between 9 and 11 October, the rebels captured 17 villages from ISIL, bringing them within two and a half kilometers of Dabiq. 30 rebels and 20 ISIL fighters were killed during the fighting.50 killed during clashes around Dabeq between rebels and IS However, a subsequent ISIL counter-attack on 11 October, recaptured two villages.ÿ™ŸÜÿ∏ŸäŸÖ ‚ÄúÿßŸÑÿØŸàŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖŸäÿ©‚Äù Ÿäÿ≥ÿ™ÿπŸäÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿäÿ∑ÿ±ÿ© ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿ®ŸÑÿØÿ© ŸàŸÇÿ±Ÿäÿ© ŸÖŸÜ ÿ®ŸäŸÜ 17 ŸÖŸÜÿ∑ŸÇÿ© ÿ≥Ÿäÿ∑ÿ±ÿ™ ÿπŸÑŸäŸáÿß ÿßŸÑŸÅÿµÿßÿ¶ŸÑ ŸÇÿ±ÿ® ÿØÿßÿ®ŸÇ The Turkish military reported it had destroyed 98 ISIL targets during the clashes.
