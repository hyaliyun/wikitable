Li was known for his flattery of the Emperor and skill in the political scene, which enabled him to remain powerful throughout his lengthy duration as chancellor. His treachery in cutting off all routes for all potential political challengers, including false accusations against other officials and the granting of key military commands to non-Han commanders, were blamed for the deterioration of Emperor Xuanzong's reign,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 216. which culminated in the An- Shi Rebellion after Li Linfu's death. Xuanzong himself admitted after the An Lushan Rebellion broke out (when Li had died) that Li was most adept at removing political rivals and being jealous of any potential challengers, a factor which resulted in the Tang administration lacking seriously competent officials during the Tianbao era.  Background  It is not known when Li Linfu was born. He was a great-grandson of Li Shuliang (李叔良) the Prince of Changping, who was a cousin of Tang Dynasty's founder Emperor Gaozu. Li Linfu's grandfather Li Xiaobin (李孝斌) carried the title of Duke of Huayang and served as a prefectural secretary general. Li Linfu's father Li Sihui (李思誨) served as a military officer at Yang Prefecture (揚州, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu).New Book of Tang, vol. 70 Li Linfu's mother was a sister of the official Jiang Jiao (姜皎), a close associate of Emperor Gaozu's great-great- grandson Emperor Xuanzong who became prominent during Emperor Xuanzong's reign, carrying the title of Duke of Chu. Li Linfu studied music and was favored by his uncle Jiang.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  Before chancellorship = During Emperor Xuanzong's reign, when Yuan Qianyao served as a chancellor, Li Linfu was a member of the staff of Emperor Xuanzong's crown prince Li Siqian.As Yuan served as chancellor from 720 and 729—and Li Linfu's recommendation by Yuwen Rong was in 726, this event must have occurred between 720 and 726. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 98 and New Book of Tang, vol. 127 . Yuan had been recommended by Jiang Jiao at the start of his career and had had his grandnephew Yuan Guangcheng (元光乘) marry Jiang's sister. Because of these relations, Yuan's son Yuan Jie (源絜) relayed a plea from Li Linfu to be made Simen Langzhong (司門郎中), a low level official at the ministry of justice. Yuan Qianyao, however, did not view Li Linfu highly, and commented, using Li Linfu's nickname, \\"People who are to serve as Lang must have good talent and virtues. Genu is no Lang.\\" Several days later, however, he had Li Linfu promoted among the ranks of Li Siqian's staff members. Li Linfu later served as Guozi Siye (國子司業), the deputy principal of the imperial university. In 726, the official Yuwen Rong became deputy chief imperial censor (御史中丞, Yushi Zhongcheng). Yuwen was friendly with Li Linfu, and therefore recommended Li Linfu to serve as a colleague; Li Linfu was thus made a deputy chief imperial censor as well, and later successively served as deputy ministers of justice (刑部侍郎, Xingbu Shilang) and civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, Libu Shilang). At that time, Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine Consort Wu dominated the palace, and her sons Li Mao (李瑁) the Prince of Shou and Li Qi (李琦) the Prince of Sheng were Emperor Xuanzong's favorite sons, diverting favor away from Li Siqian (whose name had been changed to Li Ying, by that point). Li Linfu was friendly with many important eunuchs, and through them informed Consort Wu that he was willing to support Li Mao to try to supplant Li Ying. Meanwhile, Li Linfu had also been having an affair with the wife of the chancellor Pei Guangting, who was a daughter of Wu Sansi, a deceased nephew of Emperor Xuanzong's grandmother Wu Zetian and a relative of Consort Wu. After Pei died in 733,Old Book of Tang, vol. 84 .New Book of Tang, vol. 108 . Lady Wu requested that the powerful eunuch Gao Lishi, who had served Wu Sansi at one point, to recommend Li Linfu to replace Pei. Gao did not dare to make the recommendation, but when Emperor Xuanzong was set to name Han Xiu chancellor, Gao leaked this information to Lady Wu first, who then told Li Linfu. Li Linfu submitted a petition endorsing Han, who became grateful. When Han subsequently had conflicts with fellow chancellor Xiao Song, he recommended Li Linfu to serve as chancellor, and Consort Wu was also speaking on Li Linfu's behalf. Emperor Xuanzong did not make him chancellor immediately, but made him Huangmen Shilang (黃門侍郎), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (門下省, Menxia Sheng) and favored him more. = As chancellor = In 734, Li Linfu was made the minister of rites (禮部尚書, Libu Shangshu) and was further given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (同中書門下三品), making him a chancellor de facto, serving alongside Pei Yaoqing and Zhang Jiuling. By 736, he, who gained further favor from Emperor Xuanzong by flattering the emperor, was in serious conflict with the blunt Zhang, over a number of matters: * In fall 736, when Emperor Xuanzong was at Luoyang, he had set to return to Chang'an on March 7, 737.兩千年中西曆轉換 However, at that time, an incident occurred where there were strange apparitions appearing in the Luoyang Palace, and Emperor Xuanzong did not want to stay at Luoyang. On or right before November 9, 736,兩千年中西曆轉換 he summoned the chancellors to ask them whether he could depart for Chang'an immediately. Pei and Zhang, pointing out the fact that it was harvest season and that the imperial train would interfere with harvest, requested a one- month delay. After Pei and Zhang exited, however, Li Linfu remained personally and stated his agreement with the departure, arguing that the farmers could be compensated by relieving their taxes. Emperor Xuanzong was pleased and immediately departed for Chang'an. * Emperor Xuanzong was, then, impressed with Niu Xianke, the military governor (jiedushi) of Shuofang Circuit (朔方, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), wanted to make him the minister of defense. Zhang, who pointed out that Niu was not well-learned and had started from the ranks of low-level administrators—contrary to the Tang tradition of going through the imperial examinations—opposed, and then further opposed the creation of a title. Eventually, despite Zhang's opposition, Emperor Xuanzong, with concurrence from Li Linfu, created Niu the Duke of Longxi. * Li Linfu was trying to have Emperor Xuanzong make Li Mao crown prince to replace Emperor Xuanzong's Li Ying, who had long lost Emperor Xuanzong's favor and who had offended Emperor Xuanzong and Consort Wu over an incident where he and his brothers Li Yao (李瑤) the Prince of E and Li Ju (李琚) the Prince of Guang privately complained about how Emperor Xuanzong had lost favor for their mothers. With Zhang strenuously opposing such a move, Li Ying remained in his position. * The deputy minister Xiao Jiong (蕭炅), whom Li Linfu recommended, was demoted on the suggestion of Zhang and Zhang's friend Yan Tingzhi (嚴挺之), who further offended Li Linfu by refusing to meet with him. Soon thereafter, there was an incident where Wang Yunyan (王元琰), the husband of Yan's ex-wife, was accused of corruption. Yan tried to intercede on Wang's behalf, and this was discovered. Li Linfu thus made accusations to Emperor Xuanzong that Zhang and Pei were engaging in factionalism. Around the new year 737, Emperor Xuanzong removed Pei and Zhang from their chancellor posts, making them Chengxiang (丞相)—the heads of the executive bureau of government (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng) instead, posts not considered chancellor posts. Niu was made chancellor to replace them, serving with Li Linfu, who was given the office formerly held by Zhang, Zhongshu Ling (中書令), the head of the legislative bureau (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng). This was often viewed by traditional historians as the turning point of Emperor Xuanzong's reign, which up to that point was considered a golden age in Chinese history, toward a path of degeneration. The Song Dynasty historian Sima Guang, in his Zizhi Tongjian, for example, commented:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 214. It was said that because Niu was recommended by Li Linfu, he followed Li Linfu's directions, while Li Linfu discouraged dissent within the government—telling junior officials that they, like imperial horses who would not obey directions, were easily replaceable. When the official Du Jin (杜璡) nevertheless submitted a proposal, Du was immediately sent out of a capital—ostensibly for a promotion, but considered demoted due to his new post's being away. It was further said that Li Linfu held his emotions in check and was difficult to discern; he often used sweet words to please others and then attack them when they were not ready. He endeared those who were close to the emperor, while finding ways to eliminate potential competitors for power. The Chinese proverb \\"having honey in the mouth and a sword in the belly\\" (口蜜腹劍, kou mi fu jian), first became idiomatic when used to describe him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 215. Republic of China Ministry of Education, Revised Mandarin Dictionary of Terms, Kou Mi Fu Jian . In 737, after the imperial censor Zhou Ziliang (周子諒) angered Emperor Xuanzong by filing an indictment against Niu and was caned and then exiled, Li Linfu took the opportunity to point out that Zhang had recommended Zhou. As a result, Zhang was demoted out of the capital to serve as a prefectural secretary general. Also in 737, Consort Wu decided to try to trick Li Ying, Li Yao, and Li Ju. She had a message sent to the three princes, stating, \\"There are bandits in the palace. Please report at once in armor!\\" The three princes arrived in full armor, and she thereafter told Emperor Xuanzong, \\"The three princes are planning treason. Look, they have come in full armor.\\" Emperor Xuanzong had his eunuchs check out the situation, and the three princes were seen in full armor. Yang Hui subsequently accused Li Ying, Li Yao, and Li Ju of treason. When Emperor Xuanzong discussed this with the chancellors, Li Linfu stated, \\"This is Your Imperial Majesty's family matter. We will not interfere.\\" The three princes were soon reduced to commoner rank and forced to commit suicide. Meanwhile, the deputy chief judge of the supreme court, Xu Jiao (徐嶠) submitted a flattering report to Emperor Xuanzong, pointing out that there were only 58 death sentences handed down for the year and that the reduced number of sentences showed that Emperor Xuanzong's reign was so peaceful that they were not required. Emperor Xuanzong, in turn, credited the chancellors, and created Li Linfu the Duke of Jin and Niu the Duke of Bin. It was also around this time that a revision of the laws, led by Li Linfu, Niu, and the officials in charge of the justice system, was completed. In 738, Li Linfu was made the deputy military governor of Longyou Circuit (隴右, headquartered in Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai), but did not report to Longyou and remained in the capital as chancellor. He was soon also made the military governor of Hexi Circuit (河西, headquartered in Wuwei, Gansu). Meanwhile, he was repeatedly urging Emperor Xuanzong to create Li Mao crown prince, but Emperor Xuanzong hesitated—with Consort Wu having died in 737. Instead, at Gao's urging, Emperor Xuanzong created an older son, Li Yu the Prince of Zhong crown prince instead. In 739, Li Linfu was given the additional title as minister of civil service affairs (吏部尚書, Libu Shangshu, note different character than minister of rites) and was put in charge of selecting civilian officials, while Niu was given the additional title as minister of defense and put in charge of selecting military officers. Meanwhile, when the eunuch Niu Xiantong (牛仙童, unrelated to Niu Xianke) was found to have accepted bribes, Li Linfu used this opportunity to accuse Xiao Song, now retired but still influential, of bribing Niu Xiantong, and Xiao was demoted out of the capital. Meanwhile, Li Linfu was said to be constantly bribing the eunuchs and ladies in waiting himself to keep an eye on Emperor Xuanzong's emotions and acts, to allow him to carry out actions that would help him stay in power. For example, when Emperor Xuanzong was impressed by the official Lu Xuan (盧絢) on one occasion and appeared poised to promote him, Li Linfu, viewing Lu as a potential threat, summoned Lu's younger clan members and informed them that Emperor Xuanzong was set to make Lu the commandant of distant Jiao Prefecture (交州, roughly modern Hanoi, Vietnam) or Guang Prefecture (廣州, roughly modern Guangzhou, Guangdong)—technically promotion, but considered at that point to be positions of exile—causing Lu to, in fear, submit a resignation, asking to be made a member of the staff of Li Yu (whose name was changed to Li Heng by that point). Lu Xuan was ultimately made a member of Li Heng's staff, out of contention for the chancellorship. Meanwhile, when Emperor Xuanzong appeared poised to recall Yan Tingzhi, perhaps to make him chancellor, Li Linfu tricked Yan's brother Yan Sunzhi (嚴損之) into believing that the best way to have Yan Tingzhi recalled was to claim that Yan Tingzhi was ill. Li Linfu then managed to have Emperor Xuanzong make Yan Tingzhi a member of Li Heng's staff as well, along with Qi Huan (齊澣), another influential senior official that Li Linfu viewed as a threat. Meanwhile, with Li Linfu serving as chancellor, he entrusted the official selection process to the deputy ministers of civil service affairs Song Yao (宋遙) and Miao Jinqing. In 743, a scandal involving the imperial examination process thus developed, with Song and Miao wanting to ingratiate the official Zhang Yi (張倚), who was then favored by Emperor Xuanzong, by allowing Zhang Yi's son Zhang Shi (張奭) to pass the imperial examinations. When the results were announced, they were largely viewed as unfair. The military governor An Lushan reported this to Emperor Xuanzong, and Emperor Xuanzong personally retested the 64 persons who passed the examination. Zhang Shi was unable to even write anything in response to Emperor Xuanzong's question. As a result, Song, Miao, and Zhang Yi were all demoted, but Li Linfu did not suffer any consequences. By this point, Li Linfu was said to be so powerful that officials needed his recommendations for promotion, and that those who were commissioned without such recommendations would soon fall prey to his false accusations. For example, in 743, when the official Yang Shenjin (楊慎矜) was set to be promoted to be deputy chief imperial censor, he did not dare to accept the position because Li Linfu did not recommend him, accepting the office only in 744 when he received a recommendation from Li Linfu. Also, Li Linfu, viewing the official Pei Kuan (裴寬) as a potential threat to be chancellor as well, induced the general Pei Dunfu (裴敦復) into accusing Pei Kuan of nepotism, and Pei Kuan was demoted. (Li Linfu, however, also viewed Pei Dunfu as a threat, and soon had him sent out of the capital.) Meanwhile, Emperor Xuanzong, who was very trusting of Li Linfu at this point, considered formally letting Li LInfu take over all matters of state. Gao spoke against it, pointing out then that no one would be able to control the chancellor. Emperor Xuanzong was displeased with Gao's response, but did not formally bestow Li Linfu with such authorities. By 745, Li Linfu was further using judges, the chief among whom were Ji Wen (吉溫) and Luo Xishi (羅希奭), who were known for using torture to extract confessions, in order to accuse his political enemies of crimes. For example, in 745, wanting to attack fellow chancellor Li Shizhi, who was then also minister of defense, and the official Zhang Ji (張垍), who was deputy minister of defense and a son- in-law to Emperor Xuanzong, he had some 60 officials under them accused of corruption. Under torture by Ji Wen, these officials all admitted corruption, although Emperor Xuanzong took no actions against Li Shizhi or Zhang Ji at this point. Meanwhile, Li Shizhi and another official with designs on the chancellorship—Wei Jian (韋堅), who was Li Heng's brother-in-law, as well as Li Linfu's uncle Jiang Jiao's son-in-law and thus who had initially gained favor with Li Linfu—were associating with each other, and Li LInfu viewed both as threats. He had Wei ostensibly promoted but removed Wei from a number of finance-related positions that he had held and at which he had gained Emperor Xuanzong's favors by adding to the imperial treasury income. In 746, he then tricked Li Shizhi into making a suggestion to Emperor Xuanzong of opening gold mines at Mount Hua—and then himself informed Emperor Xuanzong that, based on Taoist principles, he believed that a mine at Mount Hua would damage Emperor Xuanzong's health, thus bringing imperial displeasure on Li Shizhi. He then accused Wei and a general close to Li Heng, Huangfu Weiming (皇甫惟明), of inappropriate close association and intimated that they were ingratiating Li Heng. (Li Linfu had been apprehensive about Li Heng's elevation against his recommendation of Li Mao, and therefore sought to undermine Li Heng by making this accusation as well.) Wei and Huangfu were thus demoted to be commandery governors. Li Shizhi, in fear, offered to resign his chancellorship. Emperor Xuanzong made Li Shizhi an advisor to Li Heng and removed him from his chancellor position. Li Linfu, believing that the official Chen Xilie, who became favored by Emperor Xuanzong because of Chen's dabbling in supernatural matters, would be easy to control, and therefore recommended Chen to succeed Li Shizhi. After Chen became chancellor, however, effectively, all matters were still decided by Li Linfu, leaving Chen with no real authorities. Late in 746, when Wei Jian's brothers Wei Lan (韋蘭) and Wei Zhi (韋芝) submitted a petition to try to defend their brother, the petition backfired badly, as their citation of what Li Heng had spoken caused Emperor Xuanzong to indeed believe that they were loyal to Li Heng and not to him. Li Heng, in fear, divorced Crown Princess Wei, and subsequently, Wei Jian and his brothers were exiled, and Li Linfu took this opportunity to several other officials associated with the Weis—Li Shizhi, Wei Bin (韋斌), Li Xuan (李琄) the Prince of Xue (a nephew to both Emperor Xuanzong and Wei Jian), Pei Kuan, and Li Qiwu (李齊物)—all demoted to remote posts. When, shortly after, Du Youlin (杜有隣) the father of Li Heng's concubine Consort Du, as well as Du Youlin's son-in-law Liu Ji (柳勣) were accused of criticizing Emperor Xuanzong, Li Linfu took the opportunity to have Ji Wen extend the target, eventually convincing Emperor Xuanzong that Li Yong (李邕), Pei Dunfu, Huangfu, and the Wei brothers were all involved in the plot and had them all killed at their posts or in exile. A number of others, including Li Shizhi and Wang Ju (王琚), were terrorized into committing suicide. Li Heng, however, avoided consequences, as Emperor Xuanzong believed him to be filially pious. After Wei Jian's death, Li Linfu was still angry at Wei Jian, and had the judges continue to pursue people accused of being Wei Jian's associates and torture them, until Li LInfu's later death in 752. Meanwhile, in 747, Emperor Xuanzong wanted to expand the government's talent pool, and so issued an edict ordering that the people who had unusual talents to come to Chang'an to be examined by himself. Li Linfu, fearing that these examinees might accuse him of improprieties when they get to meet the emperor, suggested that these examinees go through two levels of preliminary examinations—by the local governments, and then by the executive bureau. As a result, no one passed the first two levels of preliminary examinations, and Li LInfu subsequently submitted a note to Emperor Xuanzong congratulating him that no talent has been overlooked by the imperial administration. Meanwhile, Li Linfu was also apprehensive about how Wang Zhongsi, the military governor of Hexi, Longyou, Hedong (河東, headquartered in Taiyuan, Shanxi) and Shuofang (朔方, headquartered in Yinchuan, Ningxia) Circuits, had become increasingly powerful and might be promoted to be chancellor. When Wang subsequently interfered with the campaign that the general Dong Yanguang (董延光) against Tufan later in 747, Li took the opportunity to accuse Wang of plotting to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong and replace him with Li Heng—with whom Wang was raised together in the palace, as Wang's father Wang Haibin (王海賓) had been killed in battle while serving in the army, and Emperor Xuanzong, taking pity on the young child, raised him in the palace. At the effort of Wang's subordinate general Geshu Han, whom Emperor Xuanzong was impressed with, Wang escaped death but was removed from his post. Meanwhile, Li Linfu also became apprehensive of Yang Shenjin's continued rise, and induced Yang's cousin's son Wang Hong (王鉷) to falsely accuse Yang, who was a descendant of Sui Dynasty's emperors, of plotting to overthrow Tang and reestablish Sui. After Ji extracted confessions from the sorcerer Shi Jingzhong (史敬忠) implicating Yang, Yang and his brothers Yang Shenyu (楊慎餘) and Yang Shenming (楊慎名) were all forced to commit suicide. During these investigations, Li Linfu was repeatedly trying to implicate Li Heng, but as Emperor Xuanzong still trusted Li Heng, and Zhang Ji and Gao Lishi were doing all they could to protect Li Heng, he was never actually able to implicate Li Heng. By this point, Li Linfu also feared that he had created too many enemies and that someone may try to assassinate him, expanded the corps of the chancellors' guards, with more than 100 guards protecting him at all times and establishment of elaborate security measures at home, including thick gates and walls and use of multiple bedrooms for himself, so that no one would know where he was sleeping on a certain night. He was also said to be living in extreme luxury, with one grand mansion in the capital itself and one country mansion, originally belonging to Li Xuan's father Li Ye (李業). He had a large group of concubines and servant woman, and he had 25 sons and 25 daughters. Three of his sons and five of his sons-in-law served in important positions. Meanwhile, Li Linfu was described to be also responsible for a policy that Emperor Xuanzong implemented late in his reign—that non-Han generals were not only promoted to important border positions, but given large commands, as, prior to this point, border military commands were often viewed as stepping stones to chancellorships—and, just during Emperor Xuanzong's own reign, this had been the route that Xue Na, Guo Yuanzhen, Zhang Jiazhen, Wang Jun, Zhang Shuo, Du Xian, Xiao Song, Niu Xianke, and Li Shizhi used to reach the chancellorship. Li Linfu, wanting to cut this route off for potential enemies, argued that non-Han generals were less likely to be engaged in factionalism and were more likely to be brave in battles. By 748, the main border posts were commanded by four non-Han generals—An Lushan, An Sishun, Geshu, and Gao Xianzhi. In 749, the commandery governor Zhao Fengzhang (趙奉璋) submitted a petition to Emperor Xuanzong accusing Li Linfu of over 20 crimes. Before the petition could arrive, however, Li Linfu already found out, and had Zhao arrested and caned to death. By 750, however, a realistic threat against Li Linfu's power was rising—as Ji Wen and Yang Zhao, the cousin to Emperor Xuanzong's then-favorite concubine Consort Yang Yuhuan—were aligned with each other, and they had Li Linfu's close associates Xiao Jiong (蕭炅) and Song Hun (宋渾) demoted, to gradually reduce Li Linfu's power, with the intent of having Yang Zhao replace Li Linfu. Ji, soon, was also ingratiating An Lushan, and An was repeatedly recommending him. Subsequently in 751, Ji was made the deputy military governor of Hedong, which was under An's command at the time. Meanwhile, though, by 752, Wang Hong was having authorities rivaling LI Linfu's, but as Wang was carefully cultivating his relationship with Li Linfu and humble to Li Linfu, Li Linfu did not act against him. However, Wang Hong's brother Wang Han (王銲), who believed that he was destined to be emperor, planned a coup with his associate Xing Zai (邢縡). When Xing subsequently did rise in rebellion, the rebellion was suppressed by Gao, Wang Hong, and Yang Zhao (whose name was changed to Yang Guozhong by this point). Li Linfu subsequently tried to defend Wang Hong before Emperor Xuanzong, and Emperor Xuanzong initially took no actions against either Wang Hong or Wang Han, but was waiting for Wang Hong to submit a petition asking for punishment. When none came, Chen Xilie, who was also beginning to be antagonistic to Li Linfu, and Yang accused Wang Hong of being complicit. Wang Hong was forced to commit suicide, and Wang Han was caned to death, causing terror in Li Linfu's heart. He thus, while keeping his chancellorship, resigned his military governorship of Shuofang and had the command transferred to An Sishun instead. That, however, failed to stem the accusations that Yang, Chen, and Geshu were making that Li Linfu was associating with not only Wang Hong and Wang Han, but also the ethnically Tujue general Li Xianzhong (李獻忠), who rebelled in 752 as well. Meanwhile, with Nanzhao repeatedly attacking Jiannan Circuit (劍南, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), Li Linfu tried to defuse Yang's threat to him by requesting that Yang, who was also military governor of Jiannan, be sent to Jiannan to defend against Nanzhao attacks. Despite Yang's repeated pleas, Emperor Xuanzong sent him on his way, but promised to recall him soon to be chancellor. Meanwhile, Li Linfu was seriously ill by this point, and when a sorcerer indicated that if the emperor looked at him, he would be cured, Emperor Xuanzong considered visiting him. Ultimately, though, at the opposition of the imperial attendants, Emperor Xuanzong did not do so, but had Li Linfu brought out to the courtyard of his mansion and then ascended a tower to look toward Li Linfu. This had no beneficial effect on Li Linfu's illness, however. Meanwhile, once Yang reached Jiannan, Emperor Xuanzong recalled him. When Yang, after arriving back in the capital, went to visit Li Linfu, Li Linfu tried to ingratiate him and entrust his family to Yang. Li Linfu died around the new year 753. = After death = After Li Linfu's death, Emperor Xuanzong initially awarded him a number of posthumous honors, including ordering a grand funeral with imperial guards serving as honor guards and the use of royal funeral items. However, in spring 753, Yang Guozhong induced An Lushan into accusing Li Linfu of having been complicit with Li Xianzhong's rebellion, and then had Li Linfu's son-in-law Yang Qixuan (楊齊宣) corroborate this. Before Li Linfu's funeral could be held, Emperor Xuanzong issued an edict stripping all of his honors and exiling his descendants. Li Linfu's casket was split open, and three of the funereal honors—the pearl in his mouth, the purple robe of chancellorship, and the golden fish to show rank—were stripped, and he was instead buried with ceremony fit for a mere commoner, in a small casket. It was said that while the people hated Li Linfu for his corrupt and harsh reign, they nevertheless mourned at how he was falsely accused after his death. After Li Heng later became emperor (as Emperor Suzong), he considered further infliction of humiliation on Li Linfu's body—by exhuming and burning it and scattering the ashes. At the suggestion of the imperial adviser Li Bi, however, he did not do so.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 218. In Fiction & popular Culture *Portrayed by Kwok Fung in The Legend of Lady Yang.

Salazar was killed during the National Chicano Moratorium March against the Vietnam War on August 29, 1970, in East Los Angeles, California. During the march, Salazar was struck and immediately killed by a tear-gas projectile fired by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy Thomas Wilson. No criminal charge was filed, but Salazar's family reached an out-of-court financial settlement with the county. Early life Born in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, Salazar was brought to the United States with his family in 1929. Salazar began his U.S. naturalization process on October 15, 1947, when he submitted his application for a certificate of arrival and preliminary form for a declaration of intention of citizenship. Career After high school, he served in the U.S. Army for two years. Salazar attended the Texas Western College, graduating in 1954 with a degree in journalism. He obtained a job as an investigative journalist at the now-defunct El Paso Herald-Post; at one point he posed as a vagrant to get arrested while he investigated the poor treatment of prisoners in the El Paso jail. After his tenure at the Herald-Post, Salazar worked at several California newspapers, including the Santa Rosa Press Democrat. Salazar was a news reporter and columnist for the Los Angeles Times from 1959 to 1970.Pilar Marrero, \\"Homenaje al periodista angelino Rubén Salazar,\\" La Opinión Newspaper, 22 April 2008. During his career, Salazar became one of the most prominent figures within the Chicano movement. He was a foreign correspondent in his early years at the Times, covering the 1965 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic, the Vietnam War, and the Tlatelolco massacre (the latter while serving as the Times' bureau chief in Mexico City). When Salazar returned to the US in 1968, he focused on the Mexican-American community and the Chicano movement, writing about East Los Angeles, an area largely ignored by the media except for coverage of crimes. He became the first Chicano journalist to cover the ethnic group while working in a large general circulation publication. Many of his pieces were critical of the Los Angeles government's treatment of Chicanos, particularly after he came into conflict with police during the East L.A. walkouts. While reporting for the Times, Salazar forged relationships with members of the Chicano movement, including draft protester Rosalio Muñoz.García, M. T. (2015). The Chicano generation: Testimonios of the movement. University of California Press In January 1970, Salazar left the Times to become news director for the Spanish language television station KMEX in Los Angeles. At KMEX, he investigated allegations of police officers' planting evidence to implicate Chicanos and the July 1970 police shooting of two unarmed Mexican nationals. According to Salazar, he was visited by undercover LAPD detectives who warned him that his investigations were \\"dangerous in the minds of barrio people.\\" During Salazar's time as the news director for KMEX, which is a Spanish-language station since 1962, he became more outspoken on Chicano issues and gave priority to cases that were important to the Chicano Movement. This included the killing of the Sánchez cousins by police which brought forth a community- wide protest as well as covering the Chicano Moratorium which ultimately led to his death. =Support for Chicano movement= Salazar's strong support for the Chicano movement as a Mexican-American distinguished him early on from other journalists in mainstream media. With a strong disparity of racial minorities in news organizations nationwide, Salazar felt it was his personal and professional responsibility to give necessary attention to the actions led by his fellow Chicanos in East Los Angeles. In February 1970, just six months prior to his death, Salazar made his support for the Chicano movement particularly clear when he authored an article in the Los Angeles Times, titled, \\"Who Is A Chicano? And What Is It the Chicanos Want?\\" In this piece, Salazar not only describes the evolving identity of Chicanos and the historic importance of the movement, but he details his frustration with the lack of Mexican-American representation among the elected representatives in the Los Angeles city council. Salazar writes, \\"Mexican-Americans, though large in numbers, are so politically impotent that in Los Angeles, where the country's largest single concentration of Spanish-speaking live, they have no one of their own on the City Council. This in a city politically sophisticated enough to have three Negro council-men.\\" Due to his support of the Chicano movement, Ruben Salazar became an FBI target and was the subject of an FBI internal subject file. While Salazar was noted as being cooperative during his interactions with the FBI around the investigation of Stokely Carmichael he drew the FBI's attention during the Korean War when he began corresponding with a white female pacifist regarding the loss of his application for US citizenship by the army. During his Carmichael interview, he is noted as saying that he could not be a witness to the speech that FBI was referencing as he was not present to which he was then asked to obtain a video of the speech to present to the FBI. While Salazar accepted, he did so under the notion that he would publicize the fact that the FBI was looking for the tape.Vigil, E. B. (1999). The crusade for justice: Chicano militancy and the government's war on dissent. The University of Wisconsin Press As they feared the civil unrest this could cause if publicized, the FBI rescinded their request. Due to the fact that the FBI and the LAPD correlated civil unrest with communism, and Salazar reported at many events where civil unrest occurred, he was viewed in his files as a communist. While Salazar was in fact critical of the Vietnam War, he was not a communist. LAPD also held files on Salazar specifically due to an article that Salazar wrote about the Chief of Police, Chief Davis, wherein he reported the fact that Davis referred to Mexican \\"tyranny and dictatorship\\". While local and national law enforcement were displeased with Salazar's reporting, he continued to write articles advocating the rights of his people the Chicano community. Death On August 29, 1970, he was covering the National Chicano Moratorium March, organized to protest the Vietnam War, in which some believed that a disproportionate number of Latinos served and were killed. The march ended with a rally that was broken up by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department using tear gas. Panic and rioting ensued. A coroner's inquest ruled the shooting of the tear gas canister a homicide, but Tom Wilson, the sheriff's deputy who fired the shot that killed Salazar, was never prosecuted. At the time, many believed the homicide was a premeditated assassination of a prominent, vocal member of the Los Angeles Chicano community. The riot started when the owners of the Green Mill liquor store, located around the corner from the Silver Dollar Bar on Whittier Boulevard, called in a complaint about people stealing from them. Deputies responded and a fight broke out. Later on that day, cadets from the nearby Sheriff's Academy were bussed to the area and marched into the park. A fight ensued, with the untrained cadets being beaten up. This led to more rioting. The Green Mill liquor store is still located at the same place on Whittier Boulevard. The owners later denied contacting the Sheriff's Department. Salazar was resting in the Silver Dollar Bar after the protest became violent. According to a witness, \\"Ruben Salazar had just sat down to sip a quiet beer at the bar, away from the madness in the street, when a deputy fired a tear gas projectile\\" at a crowd which went into the interior of the bar, hitting Salazar in the head and killing him instantly. The sheriff's deputy fired a 10-inch wall-piercing type of tear gas round from a tear gas gun of the type intended for barricade situations, rather than the type of tear gas round designed to be fired directly at people (which produces a plume of tear gas smoke). The deputy was found to have mistakenly loaded the wrong type of tear gas round, as the two types of cylinders were nearly identical. The story of Salazar's killing was the subject of \\"Strange Rumblings in Aztlan,\\" a 1971 article by gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson for Rolling Stone magazine. On February 22, 2011, the Office of Independent Review released a report of its examination of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department records on the death of Salazar. After reviewing thousands of documents, the civilian watchdog agency concluded there is no evidence that sheriff's deputies intentionally targeted Salazar or had him under surveillance. Although sheriff's deputy Thomas Wilson was identified as responsible for Salazar's death, he said that \\"he did not know, and under the circumstances was not concerned about, what kind of tear gas projectile he fired\\" at the time.Dave Smith and Paul Houston, \\"Deputy Says He Did Not Know Kind of Missile,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 6, 1970. Salazar's death captured the attention of many activists within the Chicano movement as his death occurred at the hands of those whom the movement felt was a large cause of the marginalizing of Chicano communities. During meetings with the district attorney in regards to the incident that led to Salazar's death, many Chicanos attended to voice their support as well as show a united force against police brutality. After several days of testimony, a coroner's jury returned with a split verdict, and no charges were filed by the District Attorney. Nevertheless, three years after Salazar's death, Los Angeles County reached a settlement of $700,000 with Salazar's family as a result of the sheriff's department not using \\"proper and lawful guidelines for the use of deadly force\\" during the march. At the time, this was the highest settlement recorded in Los Angeles county history. At the time of Salazar's death, he was survived by his wife, Sally (née Rober), who he met at the Los Angeles Times, and their daughters Lisa Salazar Johnson and Stephanie Salazar Cook and son John Salazar. Sally died in 1993. Legacy and honors A plaque honoring Salazar was mounted in the Globe lobby of the former Los Angeles Times building in downtown Los Angeles. *Salazar was a two-time winner of the Greater Los Angeles Press Club Award and in 1965 was presented with an award from the Equal Opportunity Foundation. *In 1971, Salazar was posthumously awarded a special Robert F.

Controversy On September 2, 2005 McIntosh made front-page news in Thailand with an announcement that she was five months pregnant. This comes after repeated, and much publicised, previous denials. It is believed by many that the controversy and negative attentions towards her were much attributed to the public perception that she had lied about her condition, rather than out-of-wedlock pregnancy. Her friends and family publicly berated the media because of their negative speculation of her ever expanding waistline when in September, 2005 her official pregnancy announcement was made. McIntosh maintained that she was previously unaware of her pregnancy of five months. The public reacted with disbelief. It also caused a rift between her and her cohost and close friend, who had berated the media in McIntosh's defence. The cohost has been a longtime friend of the actress and had been by Kathaleeya's side as a host of Samakhom Chomdao since 1995. Surivipa Kultangwattana was unaware of Kathaleeya's conditions, and sincerely berated the media from her honest love and care for a friend. Surivipa, or NuMam was publicly banned for months after speaking rudely to reporters, but as soon as Surivipa found out about the announcement she was furious. She couldn't believe that her long-time friend would not have the heart to tell her in the hours prior to the public announcements. She, just like the others, found out from the news report. She then later calmed down and apologised to the media and reporters for her rude comments and confirmed that she was truly innocent. Kathaleeya McIntosh has now come back to Thailand during March, 2006 and has kept herself hidden for two weeks. She declared to the news reporters that she was sorry for not telling about her baby, still reporters have many questions since Kataleeya has barely answered any questions. In May 2006 she got married in Pranburi, Prachuap Khiri Khan to Songkran (aka Beebee) Grachangnetara, the father of her son.

It is in the Vallée-de-l'Or Regional County Municipality. The town's territory includes a vast undeveloped area stretching from the Bell River to the Mauricie region. The town centre itself () is about northeast of Val-d'Or on the banks of the Bell River, at the intersection of the Canadian National Railway and Quebec Route 113. There are three schools in this city: St-Paul elementary school, Chanoine-Delisle elementary school and La Concorde High school. This town centre is mainly surrounded by Parent Lake and Tiblemont Lake. The main street of this city is called Avenue 10e (10th Avenue). The arena is named Centre sportif André Dubé. The economy of this city is mainly based on wood exploitation. History While the site first served as a trading post, real colonization began in 1904 when the first permanent settlers arrived. It was first identified as Rivière-Nottaway, then Rivière-Bell. Over the next 10 years, there were only a few residents who were joined by people fleeing conscription. Between 1911 and 1913 when the National Transcontinental Railway was being constructed, the area was surveyed and the geographic township of Senneterre was formed, named in honour of a captain of the Régiment de Languedoc that fought in the Battle of Sainte-Foy. The completion of the railway accelerated the development of the place. In 1914, the Parish of Saint-Paul-de-Senneterre was founded, and in 1919, the place was incorporated as the Township Municipality of Senneterre-Partie-Ouest, named after the township and its relative position therein. It developed into a center for forestry, commerce and tourism. In 1948, it shortened its name to Senneterre and changed status to village municipality, while gaining town status in 1956. In 1953, CFS Senneterre opened, home to the No. 34 Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron and part of the Pinetree Line chain of radar stations. After the closure of CFS Val-d'Or in 1976, the base also served as the Search and Rescue centre for north-western Quebec. In 1988, CFS Senneterre was closed. On July 6, 1996, the Town of Senneterre was greatly expanded from to when the unorganized territories of Lac-Quentin and Lac-Mingo and almost all of the unorganized territories of Matchi-Manitou and Lac-Bricault were added to its jurisdiction. From that day until La Tuque's amalgamation in 2002, it was in terms of area the second largest incorporated entity in Quebec after Baie-James and the largest with town status in Quebec.

During Emperor Xuanzong's reign, he also served as a general. He was known for being capable but also being self-important during his term as chancellor. Background Zhang Jiazhen was born in 666, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong. His family was from Pu Prefecture (蒲州, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), and traced its ancestry to the Jin Dynasty (265-420) chancellor Zhang Hua and his First Son (張祎) (張華 → 張祎 → 張輿 → 次惠 → 安之 → 宏策 ( 張緬 →...張九齡 Zhang Jiuling) → 絢 → 吒子 → 長度 → 俊興 → 思義 → 張俊義). who was originally from Fanyang (范陽, in modern Beijing), but his great-great-grandfather Zhang Zizha (張子吒)Zhang's biography in the New Book of Tang referred to his great-great- grandfather as Zhang Zizha, but the table of the chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang referred to his great-great-grandfather as Zhang Zhazi, inverting the two characters. Compare New Book of Tang, vol. 127 with New Book of Tang, vol. 72. served as the secretary general of Hedong Commandery (河東, roughly modern Yuncheng, later converted into Pu Prefecture) for Tang Dynasty's predecessor Sui Dynasty, and therefore relocated his family to Hedong. Zhang Jiazhen's great-grandfather Zhang Changdu (張長度), grandfather Zhang Junxing (張俊興), and father Zhang Siyi (張思義) all served as minor officials for Tang.New Book of Tang, vol. 72. He had at least one younger brother, Zhang Jiayou (張嘉祐), and as Zhang Siyi died early, Zhang Jiazhen and Zhang Jiayou supported each other in their youths. Zhang Jiazhen passed the imperial examinations in his youth and was made the magistrate of Pingxiang County (平鄉, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), but was removed from office for an offense unspecified in historical accounts. He then returned home to Pu Prefecture. During the Chang'an era (701-705) of Emperor Gaozong's wife Wu Zetian, there was an occasion when the imperial censor Zhang Xunxian (張循憲) was ordered to examine Hedong Circuit (河東道, roughly modern Shanxi), when he encountered some cases that were difficult for him to decide. He thus asked the local officials, \\"Is there anyone here who is intelligent whom I can consult?\\" A local official recommended Zhang Jiazhen, and Zhang Xunxian consulted him. Zhang Jiazhen surprised Zhang Xunxian with his ability to analyze the situation and come up with the correct resolutions. He thus had Zhang Jiazhen draft his report to Wu Zetian as well. After Zhang Xunxian returned to the capital Luoyang, Wu Zetian was impressed by the quality of the report. Zhang Xunxian informed her that it was Zhang Jiazhen who drafted it for him, and offered to give his office to Zhang Jiazhen. She responded, \\"Do I not have an office for the capable?\\" She summoned Zhang Jiazhen to Luoyang and met with him personally. She was impressed with him, and thus made him an imperial censor; she also promoted Zhang Xunxian for his ability to find Zhang Jiazhen.The Zizhi Tongjian placed this event in 702, although it is not clear whether that was the actual year. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 207. Zhang Jiazhen subsequently successively served as a low-level official at the ministry of defense (兵部員外郎, Bingbu Yuanwailang),As to be discussed below, historical accounts indicated that at one point Zhang Jiazhen was the subordinate of Zhang Shuo when Zhang Shuo was the deputy minister of defense. As Zhang Shuo served as the deputy minister of defense during the second reign of Wu Zetian's son Emperor Zhongzong (r. 705-710), Zhang Jiazhen's stint at the ministry of defense was likely at that time as well, although it is not completely clear. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 97 [Zhang Shuo's biography]. when he became known for his abilities; Zhongshu Sheren (中書舍人), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng); the commandant at Liang Prefecture (梁州, roughly modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) and then Qin Prefecture (秦州, roughly modern Tianshui, Gansu); and then the secretary general at Bing Prefecture (并州, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). He became known for strictness in his governance, and his subordinates feared him. During Emperor Xuanzong's reign Early in the Kaiyuan era (713-741) of Wu Zetian's grandson Emperor Xuanzong, Zhang Jiazhen, who was then still serving as the secretary general at Bing Prefecture, was in then-capital Chang'an on one occasion to report on his prefecture. Emperor Xuanzong had heard of his capabilities and therefore praised him. Zhang Jiazhen took the opportunity to request that his brother Zhang Jiayou, who was then the secretary general at Shan Prefecture (鄯州, roughly modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai), be moved to a closer location to him, as he missed his brother. Emperor Xuanzong praised him for his brotherly love and made Zhang Jiayou the prefect of Xin Prefecture (忻州, roughly modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), close to Zhang Jiazhen's post at Bing Prefecture. In 718, with a group of Eastern Tujue people having submitted to Tang in the aftermaths of the death of the Eastern Tujue khan Ashina Mochuo, Zhang Jiazhen suggested that a military base be established to help curb in the Eastern Tujue people. Pursuant to his suggestion, Tianbing Base (天兵軍) was established at Bing Prefecture, and Zhang was put in command of the base. In 718, Zhang was in Chang'an when there were accusations made that he was overly luxurious and corrupt while at Bing Prefecture. The chief imperial censor Wang Jùn thus indicted him, but after investigation, Zhang Jiazhen was cleared. Emperor Xuanzong considered executing the accuser as punishment for the false accusation, but Zhang pointed out that such an execution would have a chilling effect on the report of wrongdoing. Emperor Xuanzong thus only exiled the accuser, and he came to believe that Zhang was faithful and capable of greater duties, informing Zhang that one day he would likely be chancellor. Zhang responded: Emperor Xuanzong instead responded, \\"Just go back right now; I will surely recall you soon.\\" In 720, when Emperor Xuanzong was set to remove the chancellors Song Jing and Su Ting and was considering whom to make chancellor, he thought of Zhang Jiazhen, but forgot Zhang Jiazhen's name. He thus asked the official Wei Kang (韋抗), \\"I can remember a general to the north who is capable; his name is Zhang, and his personal name has two characters. Can you think of it for me?\\" Wei thought it was Zhang Qiqiu (張齊丘), who was then the military governor (jiedushi) of Shuofang Circuit (朔方, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), and so Emperor Xuanzong had an edict drafted up, making Zhang Qiqiu chancellor. That night, however, when Emperor Xuanzong was reviewing files, he ran across Zhang Jiazhen's name and remembered him.New Book of Tang, vol. 127. He thus modified the edict to commission Zhang Jiazhen instead as Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia PIngzhengshi (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor de facto, along with Yuan Qianyao. Later that year, Zhang was made Zhongshu Ling (中書令) -- the head of the legislative bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor. As chancellor, Zhang was said to be capable and energetic, but self-important and inflexible; he was criticized by popular sentiment for those faults. He recommended the junior officials Miao Yansi (苗延嗣), Lü Taiyi (呂太一), Yuan Jiajing (員嘉靜), and Cui Xun (崔訓) for promotions and entrusted them with many important tasks. In 722, when Emperor Xuanzong visited Luoyang, an official at the Luoyang County government, Wang Jūn (王均, note different tone than the censor who indicted Zhang), had been building a mansion for Zhang, hoping to ingratiate him enough to be made an imperial censor. However, Wang Jūn was accused of corruption and set to be sentenced to death by caning. Zhang had Wang Jūn put to death as quickly as possible to avoid any taint, and then blamed Wei Kang, who was then chief imperial censor, and Wei Kang's deputy Wei Xuxin (韋虛心), and had them demoted. Later that year, the official Jiang Jiao (姜皎) was accused of leaking secret discussions with Emperor Xuanzong (in which Emperor Xuanzong talked with him about the possibility of deposing his wife Empress Wang. Zhang and Empress Wang's brother Wang Shouyi (王守一) both advocated that Jiang be caned and then exiled. Emperor Xuanzong did so, and Jiang died on the way to his place of exile. Soon thereafter, Pei Zhouxian (裴伷先) the commandant at Guang Prefecture (廣州, roughly modern Guangzhou, Guangdong) was accused of corruption, and Zhang again advocated caning him. However, Zhang Shuo, who had been made a chancellor as well, argued that public caning is inappropriate for high-level officials, and Emperor Xuanzong agreed. After the meeting with Emperor Xuanzong was over, Zhang Jiazhen, displeased, asked Zhang Shuo, \\"Why did you have to go into such deep talk?\\" Zhang Shuo responded: Meanwhile, Zhang Shuo and Zhang Jiazhen had not been on good terms, because Zhang Shuo, who ranked below Zhang Jiazhen in the precedence of chancellors, had previously served as Zhang Jiazhen's superior while serving as deputy minister of defense, and therefore resented Zhang Jiazhen for not showing him more respect. Meanwhile, Zhang Jiazhen's brother Zhang Jiayou had been made a high-ranked general, but in 723 was accused of corruption. At Zhang Shuo's suggestion, Zhang Jiazhen wore plain- colored clothes and waited outside the palace for punishment, to show remorse. Instead of escaping punishment as Zhang Jiazhen hoped, however, Zhang Jiazhen, without getting another audience with Emperor Xuanzong, was demoted to be the prefect of You Prefecture (幽州, roughly modern Beijing). Zhang Shuo then replaced him as Zhongshu Ling, drawing hatred from Zhang Jiazhen, who commented, \\"There can be two people serving as Zhongshu Ling. Why did he have to squeeze me out?\\" In 724, Zhang Jiazhen was recalled to serve as minister of census (戶部尚書, Hubu Shangshu), as well as secretary general at Yi Prefecture (益州, roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan). Emperor Xuanzong had Zhang Jiazhen join the chancellors for a banquet. Zhang Jiazhen, still resenting Zhang Shuo, cursed Zhang Shuo when they were both at the banquet, requiring Yuan Qianyao and Wang Jùn to step in to moderate between the two. Later in 724, Wang Shouyi was accused of using witchcraft to try to regain Emperor Xuanzong's favor for his sister Empress Wang. Empress Wang was deposed, and Wang Shouyi was first exiled and then ordered to commit suicide. Zhang Jiazhen, because of his association with Wang Shouyi, was demoted to be the prefect of Tai Prefecture (臺州, roughly modern Taizhou, Zhejiang). However, he was eventually recalled to serve successively as minister of public works (工部尚書, Gongbu Shangshu) and then prefect of Ding Prefecture (定州, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei). He was also created the Marquess of Hedong. After he got to Ding Prefecture, on one occasion, he commissioned a stele for a temple dedicated to the god of Mount Heng, and personally wrote the text on the stele, described to be very beautiful in form. As there were much money donations made to the temple, he believed himself to be responsible for those donations, and so took a small part of it. In 729, Zhang requested to be allowed to go to Luoyang on account of illness. Emperor Xuanzong agreed. Once Zhang got to Luoyang, he was no longer able to see, and Emperor Xuanzong sent imperial physicians to treat him. He died in the fall that year and was given posthumous honors. Zhang Jiazhen's son Zhang Yanshang and grandson Zhang Hongjing later served as chancellors for Emperor Dezong and Emperor Xianzong, respectively. It was said that although Zhang served in many important offices, he never spent time managing his estate. When he was at Ding Prefecture, some relatives suggested that he should begin to do so. Zhang responded: Those who heard him were impressed by the analysis. Notes and references * Old Book of Tang, vol. 99. * New Book of Tang, vol. 127. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 207, 211, 212, 213.

History The squadron was established on October 1, 1985, and immediately tasked with the evaluation and testing of the AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM), and became the first Prowler squadron to operationally deploy with HARM aboard in August 1986. The squadron was deployed aboard for the beginning of Operation Desert Shield in September 1991. The squadron returned to the Persian Gulf aboard the Eisenhower for Operation Southern Watch. May 1994 the squadron deploy aboard to participate in the 50th D-Day Anniversary, and support Operation Southern Watch in Iraq, as well as Operations Deny Flight and Sharp Guard in Bosnia. The squadron earned the Battle “E” for their efforts. The squadron took their first Expeditionary role supporting combat operations over the Balkans with the 31st Air Expeditionary Wing out of Aviano Air Base, Italy. In 1999, in support of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, they assumed command of Electronic Attack Wing Aviano, which consisted of 100 aircrew and 300 support personnel. While flying over 740 combat missions and 3300 flight hours, 117 HARM were fired against the enemy, earning the squadron a Navy Unit Commendation Medal. The Patriots returned to their first ship, USS John F. Kennedy, for another combat deployment in 2002, during which the Patriots detached to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, and achieved a 100% combat sortie completion rate.

See, e.g., Heming Yong, Jing Peng, Chinese lexicography: a history from 1046 BC to AD 1911.) (663–730), courtesy name Daoji (道濟) or Yuezhi (說之), formally Duke Wenzhen of Yan (燕文貞公), was an official of the Chinese Tang dynasty and Wu Zetian's Zhou dynasty, serving as a chancellor three separate stints during the reigns of Emperor Ruizong and Emperor Xuanzong. He is known for having suggested the transition of Tang central government armed forces from being conscription- based to recruitment-based, and for turning the office of the chancellor into a specialized post with strong executive powers. Zhang Yue was a well- respected literary figure of his time, and was ranked alongside Su Ting (Duke Wenxian of Xu, another of Emperor Xuanzong's chancellors) as the two great writers of the Kaiyuan era. They were known in unison as 燕许大手笔 (\\"Immense pen- brushes from Yan and Xu\\").  Background  Zhang Yue was born in 663, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong. His family was from the Tang Dynasty eastern capital Luoyang, and traced its ancestry to the great Han Dynasty strategist Zhang Liang, as well as a line of officials that served Cao Wei, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Northern Wei, and Northern Zhou.New Book of Tang, vol. 72. In his youth, Zhang Yue passed the imperial examinations and received the highest score among the group of people who took the exam at the same time. He was made an attendant in the crown prince's studies.It is not known which crown prince Zhang served, however.  During Wu Zetian's reign  During the reign of Wu Zetian (r. 690-705), Zhang Yue was gradually promoted to You Bujue (), a low-level official at the legislative bureau of government (鳳閣, Fengge). While serving there, he participated in a project, headed by Li Jiao to create a work known as the Essence of Pearls from the Three Religions (三教珠英, Sanjiao Zhuying) -- a compilation of various poetry about Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, in which Wu Zetian's lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong also participated, to give them a legitimate reason to enter the palace. In 700, when Wu Zetian spent summer and fall at Sanyang Palace (), away from Luoyang (which she had made capital), Zhang Yue submitted an earnest petition urging her to return to Luoyang, which she did not accept. Early in her Chang'an era (701-705), the Essence of Pearls from the Three Religions was completed, and the participants were rewarded—with Zhang Yue becoming You Shi (), an imperial chronicler, as well as an imperial attendant; he was also put in charge of grading the entries of imperial examination takers. Sometime thereafter, he was promoted to be Fengge Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau. In 703, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were apprehensive that if Wu Zetian, who was ill at the time, died, they would be killed by the senior chancellor Wei Yuanzhong. They therefore falsely accused Wei and the official Gao Jian () of having said that Wu Zetian was too old and that it was better to support her son and crown prince, Li Xian. Wu Zetian, in anger, arrested Wei and Gao, who proclaimed their innocence. Zhang Changzong promised Zhang Yue a promotion if he would corroborate the accusations against Wei, who was Zhang Yue's superior. Zhang Yue initially agreed, but as he entered the palace, several fellow junior officials, Song Jing, Zhang Tinggui (), and Liu Zhiji, pointed out to him that it was important for him to leave a clean name in history. After he entered Wu Zetian's presence, instead of corroborating Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong's accusations against Wei, he proclaimed Wei's innocence and accused Zhang Changzong of suborning perjury. Wu Zetian, while angry at Zhang Yue, spared Wei and Gao as a result, exiling them and Zhang Yue instead to the Lingnan region—in Zhang Yue's case, to Qin Prefecture (欽州, roughly modern Qinzhou, Guangdong). Zhang Yue would remain there for the rest of Wu Zetian's reign.  During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign  In 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown, and Li Xian, a former emperor, returned to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). He recalled Zhang Yue from exile to serve as an official at the ministry of defense (兵部, Bingbu). Subsequently, Zhang was made the deputy minister of public works (工部侍郎, Gongbu Shilang). During Emperor Zhongzong's Jinglong era (707-710), his mother died, and he left public service to observe a period of mourning—traditionally three years under Confucian principles, but which were often shortened for officials. After he had mourned for the typical shortened period, Emperor Zhongzong was set to recall him to serve as Huangmen Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau (門下省, Menxia Sheng), but he declined, asking to mourn for the entire three-year period. He was allowed to do so, and this drew popular approval. After the three-year period was complete, he was recalled to serve again as the deputy minister of public works, and then the deputy minister of defense (兵部侍郎, Bingbu Shilang). He was also made an imperial scholar at Hongwen Pavilion ().However, the Jinglong era was less than three years long, which suggests that Zhang Yue's mother actually died prior to the start of Jinglong era. Sometime during Emperor Zhongzong's reign, Zhang submitted a petition asking him to end his habit, which started in Wu Zetian's reign, of going up a tower to watch non-Han splash cold water on themselves to celebrate the arrival of winter, on account that such a ceremony was disrespectful. Emperor Zhongzong agreed, and stopped watching such ceremonies.  During Emperor Ruizong's second reign  In 710, Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly—a death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning carried out by his powerful wife Empress Wei and daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle, so that Empress Wei could be \\"emperor\\" like Wu Zetian and Li Guo'er could be crown princess. Meanwhile, Emperor Zhongzong's son by a concubine, Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen, was named emperor (as Emperor Shang), but Empress Wei retained power as empress dowager and regent. Less than a month later, Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping and nephew Li Longji the Prince of Linzi rose in rebellion, killing Empress Dowager Wei and Li Guo'er. Li Longji's father Li Dan the Prince of Xiang, himself a former emperor, returned to the throne (as Emperor Ruizong), displacing Emperor Shang. After Emperor Ruizong's return to the throne, Zhang Yue was made Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau (by now named Zhongshu Sheng (), as well as the secretary general for the capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (雍州, roughly modern Xi'an, Shaanxi, as Emperor Zhongzong moved the capital back to Chang'an from Luoyang). Later that year, Emperor Zhongzong's son Li Chongfu the Prince of Qiao tried to rise against Emperor Ruizong at Luoyang, but was quickly defeated, and he committed suicide. Several hundred of people, accused of being complicit with Li Chongfu's plot, were arrested, but it was difficult to adjudicate their guilt or innocence. Emperor Ruizong sent Zhang to Luoyang to judge them. Zhang, after interrogating Li Chongfu's main co-conspirators Zhang Lingjun () and Zheng Yin, quickly figured out that most of the accused were not part of the plot, and released them. Once he returned to Chang'an, Emperor Ruizong thanked him: At that time, Li Longji was crown prince, and both Zhang Yue and Chu Wuliang () served as attending officials in his studies, and he became close to them. In 711, Zhang was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto. At that time, there was much struggle at court between the factions of Princess Taiping and Li Longji. At one point, there was a prediction by a sorcerer that there would be an incursion into a palace—a prediction that much troubled Emperor Ruizong. Zhang stated that this rumor must have been spread by someone who was intent to harm Li Longji, and that the best way to dissipate the rumors would be for Emperor Ruizong to transfer some of the authority to Li Longji—an assessment that fellow chancellor Yao Chong concurred in. Emperor Ruizong agreed and did so. (However, when Yao and Song Jing then proposed sending Princess Taiping and two princes with arguably better claims on the crown prince title than Li Longji—his older brother Li Chengqi the Prince of Song and cousin Li Shouli the Prince of Bin (the son of Emperor Zhongzong's and Ruizong's older brother Li Xian (note different character than Emperor Zhongzong)) -- out of the capital, Princess Taiping found out and got Yao and Song demoted out of the capital, although Zhang was not demoted at that time. Later that year, however, as a part of a government reorganization, Zhang, along with the other chancellors, were removed from their chancellor positions. Zhang was made Shangshu Zuo Cheng (), one of the Secretaries General of the executive bureau (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng), and given an office in Luoyang, away from Chang'an.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  In 712, Emperor Ruizong passed the throne to Li Longji, who took the throne as Emperor Xuanzong. However, Emperor Ruizong retained most of the imperial authority as Taishang Huang (retired emperor), and Princess Taiping, through him, continued to exert great influence on governance. As of 713, it was said that five of the seven chancellors at the time -- Dou Huaizhen, Cen Xi, Xiao Zhizhong, Cui Shi, and Lu Xiangxian—were recommended by her (although Lu was not considered a follower of hers). With Emperor Xuanzong and Princess Taiping locked into a power struggle, Zhang Yue, from his post at Luoyang, had a messenger present Emperor Xuanzong with his swordZizhi Tongjian, vol. 210.—meaning to tell him that it was time to take decisive action. Meanwhile, it was said that Princess Taiping, Dou, Cen, Xiao, and Cui; along with other officials Xue Ji, Li Jin () the Prince of Xinxing (a grandson of Li Deliang (), a cousin of Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu), Li You (), Jia Yingfu (), Tang Jun (); the generals Chang Yuankai (), Li Ci (), and Li Qin (); and the monk Huifan (), were plotting to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong. It was further said that they discussed, with the lady in waiting Lady Yuan to poison the gastrodia elata that Emperor Xuanzong routinely took as an aphrodisiac. When this alleged plot was reported to Emperor Xuanzong by Wei Zhigu, Emperor Xuanzong, who had already received advice from Wang Ju () and Cui Riyong, in addition to Zhang, to act first, did so. He convened a meeting with his brothers Li Fan () the Prince of Qi, Li Ye () the Prince of Xue, Guo, along with a number of his associates — the general Wang Maozhong (), the officials Jiang Jiao () and Li Lingwen (), his brother- in-law Wang Shouyi (), the eunuch Gao Lishi, and the military officer Li Shoude () — and decided to act first. On July 29,兩千年中西曆轉換 Emperor Xuanzong had Wang Maozhong take 300 soldiers to the imperial guard camp to behead Chang and Li Ci. Then, Jia, Li You, Xiao, and Cen were arrested and executed as well. Dou and Princess Taiping committed suicide. Emperor Ruizong turned over imperial authority to Emperor Xuanzong and thereafter was no longer involved in important decisions. Emperor Xuanzong subsequently recalled Zhang from Luoyang to serve as Zhongshu Ling (), the head of the legislative bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor. Later in the year, when Emperor Xuanzong changed the names of many official titles, the legislative bureau's name was changed to Ziwei Sheng (), and its head's title changed to Ziwei Ling (); Zhang's title changed accordingly. When it was discovered that the former chancellor Li Jiao, during Empress Dowager Wei's regency, had suggested that Emperor Ruizong's sons be sent out of Chang'an to serve as local officials, there was suggestions that Li Jiao should be executed, but Zhang pointed out that while Li Jiao might be viewed as having suggested inappropriate, he was being faithful to Empress Dowager Wei. Emperor Xuanzong agreed, and only sent Li Jiao's son Li Chang () out of Chang'an to serve as a prefectural prefect, and had Li Jiao go with his son. Emperor Xuanzong, meanwhile, was prepared to recall Yao Chong to serve as chancellor as well. It was said that Zhang disliked Yao, and tried to prevent Yao's promotion by having the chief imperial censor Zhao Yanzhao file an indictment against Yao, and then had Emperor Xuanzong's associate Jiang Jiao () recommend Yao to serve as the commandant at Bing Prefecture (并州, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) -- both of which Emperor Xuanzong rebuffed, and Emperor Xuanzong recalled Yao to serve as minister of defense and chancellor de facto. Yao, later in the year, accused Zhang of meeting Emperor Xuanzong's brother Li Fan secretly. Around the new year 713, Emperor Xuanzong demoted Zhang to serve as the prefect of Xiang Prefecture (相州, in modern Handan, Hebei), and as the examiner of the Hebei Circuit (河北道, roughly modern Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin). For reasons lost to history, he was later demoted to be the prefect of Yue Prefecture (岳州, roughly modern Yueyang, Hunan), and the benefits he was to draw from his fief were suspended. Zhang became fearful of what would come next. At that time, one of the chancellors was Su Ting, whose father Su Gui Zhang had been a friend of. Zhang thus wrote a poem praising five great officials, including Su Gui, and presented it to Su Ting. Su Ting was greatly touched by the poem, and submitted a petition to Emperor Xuanzong pointing out of Zhang's great contributions. Thereafter, Zhang was made the secretary general of the more important Jing Prefecture (荊州, roughly modern Jingzhou, Hubei). He was later further given a general title and made the acting commandant at You Prefecture (幽州, roughly modern Beijing). On one occasion when he went to Chang'an to meet Emperor Xuanzong, he did so in military uniform, impressing Emperor Xuanzong with his preparedness. Emperor Xuanzong then made him the acting secretary general at Bing Prefecture; the commander of the Tianbing Base (天兵軍, in Bing Prefecture); and chief imperial censor, with directions that he be responsible for editing imperial histories, despite his departure from Chang'an—that is, to have the historical archives delivered to him so that he can edit them while in the army. In 720, Wang Jun, the commander of the army at Shuofang (朔方, in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), accused the Pugu () and Jiadie (name not in Unicode) tribal chieftains of plotting to betray Tang territory to Eastern Tujue, and slaughtered them. When this was heard by people of Bayegu () and Tongluo () tribes, who were settled in Zhang's territory, became terrified. Zhang, taking only 20 cavalry soldiers with him, toured the tribal areas to comfort them, spending nights with them in the tents. Zhang's deputy Li Xian (李憲, note different character than Emperor Zhongzong and the former crown prince) believed that it was not wise to trust the tribes in this manner and sent a letter to Zhang trying to dissuade him. Zhang responded famously: As a result of Zhang's tour, the Bayegu and Tongluo tribes were calmed and did not create any problems. Subsequently, in 721, when Kang Daibin () rose in rebellion in the Shuofang region, Emperor Xuanzong commissioned Zhang, along with Wang Jun and Wang Maozhong, to attack Kang. Wang Jun was soon able to capture Kang and deliver him to Emperor Xuanzong. Meanwhile, Zhang's subordinate, the general Ashina Xian (), suggested that the Dangxiang tribes, which did not rebel with Kang but was in contact with Kang's forces, be slaughtered, but Zhang refused, pointing out that Kang had already been defeated and that the killing should not be excessive. Later that year, Zhang was recalled to Chang'an to serve as minister of defense (兵部尚書, Bingbu Shangshu) and chancellor de facto with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (), and he continued to be responsible for editing the imperial histories. In 722, Zhang was also given the title as military governor (with the recently created title of jiedushi) of Shuofang base, and he toured Shuofang. When Kang Daibin's former associate Kang Yuanzi () rebelled and claimed khan title, Zhang captured him and moved his people to the modern Henan region. Meanwhile, at Zhang's suggestion, the Tang northern border defense forces, which had about 600,000 men at that time, was reduced by 200,000 men to allow the soldiers to return home. Further, seeing that the Tang conscription system, due to abuses against the soldiers at the time, was near a collapse, as the soldiers were forced into long tours of duty but their families were not exempt from taxes, thus causing great numbers of desertions, Zhang suggested a switch to a recruitment-based system where soldiers were paid salaries. This allowed, for a time, Tang's soldier supply to be replenished. (Some later historians condemned Zhang for the abolition of the conscription system, believing the abolition to be the root of Tang's later fracturing, but some others, such as the modern historian Bo Yang, argued that Zhang's actions not only were necessary to restore the supply of soldiers but saved many lives.See, e.g., Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 51, 722.) Soon thereafter, Pei Zhouxian () the commandant at Guang Prefecture (廣州, roughly modern Guangzhou, Guangdong) was accused of corruption, and the chancellor Zhang Jiazhen advocated caning him. However, Zhang Yue argued that public caning is inappropriate for high-level officials, and Emperor Xuanzong agreed. After the meeting with Emperor Xuanzong was over, Zhang Jiazhen, displeased, asked Zhang Yue, \\"Why did you have to go into such deep talk?\\" Zhang Yue responded: As of 723, Zhang Yue and Zhang Jiazhen were not on good terms. When Zhang Jiazhen's brother Zhang Jiayou () was accused of corruption, Zhang Yue suggested to Zhang Jiazhen that he wear plain clothes and wait for punishment outside the palace, and Zhang Jiazhen agreed. Zhang Jiazhen was subsequently demoted to be the prefect of You Prefecture. Later that year, Zhang Yue was again made Zhongshu Ling. Meanwhile, Emperor Xuanzong, an ardent student of literature, had commissioned the creation of a literary institute known as Lizheng Institute (麗正書院, later renamed Jixian Institute (), headed by Zhang Yue, for literary studies, with such officials as Xu Jian (), He Zhizhang (), and Zhao Dongxi () serving as scholars, to accompany him in his literary studies. The official Lu Jian (), believing that the expenses for maintaining Lizheng Institute were unjustified, planned to petition to disband it. Zhang Yue pointed out that the study of literature had relatively low expenses and had great cultural value to dissuade Lu from submitting the petition, and when Emperor Xuanzong heard this, he had even greater respect for Zhang. Around the same time, Zhang also proposed a reorganization of the office of the chancellors—renaming it from Zhengshi Tang () to Zhongshu Menxia (), and further creating five subordinate offices therein to be responsible for five separate areas of governance. In 724, at Zhang's suggestion, Emperor Xuanzong began to prepare a grand ceremony (known as Fengshan () to offer sacrifices to heaven and earth at Mount Tai—despite opposition from fellow chancellor Yuan Qianyao, which began discord between Zhang and Yuan. Emperor Xuanzong carried out the ceremony at 725—and the ceremony caused much resentment toward Zhang, as, at Zhang's recommendations, a number of officials at the legislative and examination bureaus participated in the ceremony and were promoted after the ceremony, but other officials were not awarded, and neither were the soldiers who attended to Emperor Xuanzong during the ceremony. Zhang himself was given the additional title of You Chengxiang (), one of the heads of the executive bureau. In 726, at Zhang's suggestion, regulations on ceremonies, which had twice been codified during the reigns of Emperor Taizong and Emperor Gaozong, were reorganized to harmonize the different regulations written during those reigns. Later in the year, though, Zhang's hold on power would crumble. Emperor Xuanzong had recalled Cui Yinfu () the mayor of Luoyang to Chang'an, planning to promote him. Zhang, who viewed Cui lightly because Cui's lack of literary talent, suggested that Cui be made a general. Meanwhile, Zhang had recommended another official, Cui Rizhi (崔日知, Cui Riyong's cousin), to be chief imperial censor. Emperor Xuanzong rejected both recommendations, and made Cui Rizhi a general and Cui Yinfu the chief imperial censor. Cui Yinfu, knowing that Zhang had opposed his promotion, subsequently submitted an indictment for corruption against Zhang, along with fellow censors Yuwen Rong, whom Zhang also disliked, and Li Linfu. Emperor Xuanzong had Yuan, Cui Yinfu, Wei Kang () the minister of justice, and Hu Gui () the assistant chief judge of the supreme court, interrogate Zhang. Evidence of Zhang's corruption were found. However, when Emperor Xuanzong sent Gao Lishi to visit Zhang, Gao reported back that Zhang had shown great humility—by sleeping on a straw mat and eating with clay pots—in his distress, and Gao further pointed out to Emperor Xuanzong of Zhang's contributions. Emperor Xuanzong, in response, removed Zhang from his chancellor post but allowed him to remain as head of the executive bureau and head of Jixian Institute. Subsequently, Cui Yinfu and Yuwen, fearful that Zhang would again become chancellor, continued to accuse him of offenses, while Zhang's allies made counteraccusations against Cui and Yuwen. Emperor Xuanzong, tired of these accusations, in 727, ordered Zhang to retire, Cui to be removed from his post to return home to support his mother, and Yuwen to be demoted to be the prefect of Wei Prefecture (魏州, also in modern Handan). As Zhang lost power those in his circle lost status, like Zhang Jiuling who was demoted from his position as zhongshu sheren (, a third-level position in the Secretariat) and hanlin gongfeng () where his responsibilities had included consulting for drafts of imperial decrees and letters. In 728, Emperor Xuanzong again made Zhang a scholar at Jixian Institute. Even though Zhang was largely retired by this point, it was said that Emperor Xuanzong often sent eunuchs to ask for his suggestions when important matters were to be decided. In 729, Zhang was made Zuo Chengxiang (), the other head of the executive bureau. The day that Zhang was to take office, Song and Yuan were to be take new offices as well, Emperor Xuanzong set up a grand ceremony for their inauguration, including an elaborate tent, music, and food from the imperial kitchen. Emperor Xuanzong personally wrote a poem commemorating the contributions of the three.New Book of Tang, vol. 124 . He also gave Zhang the honorific title Kaifu Yitong Sansi (). By this time, Zhang Yue's oldest son Zhang Jun () was serving as a mid- level official at the legislative bureau, and the second son Zhang Ji () had been given Emperor Xuanzong's daughter Princess Ningqing in marriage. Zhang Yue's brother Zhang Guang () carried the honorific title Yinqing Guanglu Daifu (). It was said that there was no official whose household was more honored than Zhang Yue's. In 730, Zhang Yue fell ill, and he died around new year 731. Emperor Xuanzong had him buried with great honors.

It was utilized by the Dutch, Greek and Hungarian armies during World War II. It was routinely issued to Italian colonial troops, alongside the Mannlicher M1895 rifle.  History  The Schwarzlose M. 7 was a belt-fed machine gun, usually mounted on a tripod, designed by the Prussian firearms designer Andreas Schwarzlose. While its water-cooled barrel gave it an appearance broadly resembling the family of Maxim-derived machine- guns (such as the British Vickers and the German Maschinengewehr 08), internally the Schwarzlose was of a much simpler design, which made the weapon comparatively inexpensive to manufacture. Its unusual delayed blowback mechanism contained only a single spring. The initial variants of the M.7/12 had a cyclic rate of about 400 rounds/minute. During World War I this was increased to 580 rounds/minute by using a stronger mainspring. The Schwarzlose was robust and reliable, if used in its intended role as an infantry weapon. It met with less success when it was used in roles it had not been designed for, unlike the highly adaptable Maxim-derived machine guns. Production The Schwarzlose enjoyed moderate export success in the years leading up to World War I. Apart from the armies of the Austro-Hungarian empire (8mm caliber) it was adopted by the armies of Greece (6.5mm caliber), the Netherlands (6.5mm caliber) and Sweden (using the 6.5×55mm cartridge and designated kulspruta m/1914).The Swedish machineguns before 1950. Text and pictures by O. Janson In addition, the British ammunition company Kynoch produced a machine gun based on the Schwarzlose patent in 1907, using the .303 British cartridge. The Netherlands used an modified version, the Schwarzlose M.08, in production from 1918 (2,006 made). After the First World War the Schwarzlose continued in use with the new nations that emerged from the fragments of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Captured examples of the Schwarzlose saw some sporadic use by Russian and Italian units during the First World War. During World War II the Schwarzlose saw limited action in North Africa as an anti-aircraft weapon in Italian service. It was also the standard MG issued to Italian colonial troops. Besides, captured Schwarzlose machine guns of various types saw service with second line units of the Nazi German army, especially during the desperate fighting that took place in the final phases of that conflict. Overview Toggle-delayed blowback operation of the 07/12 machine gun. The Schwarzlose MG M.7 is a toggle-delayed blowback, water-cooled machine gun. The mechanism incorporates a device that oils cartridge cases to ease extraction. Use as an infantry and naval weapon Tyrolean high mountains. For infantry use, the Schwarzlose was usually employed as a traditional, tripod mounted, heavy machine gun served by a crew of at least three soldiers, one of whom was the commander, usually an NCO, a gunner who carried the weapon, a third soldier who served as an ammunition carrier and loader and he would presumably also carry the tripod although in practice a fourth soldier might be added to the team to carry the tripod. Another less commonly seen method of deployment was the more compact 'backpack mount'. In this configuration the gun was fitted with a backwards folding bipod attached to the front of the water jacket near the muzzle. The backpack mount itself consisted of a square wooden frame with a metal socket in the center. When the gun was fully deployed the frame was laid on the ground, the gun's central mounting point that usually attached to a tripod now had a small mounting pin attached to it instead which was inserted into the mounting socket in the center of the wooden backpack frame and finally the bipod was folded forward. The Schwarzlose would also have seen service as a fortress weapon in which case it would have been deployed on a variety of heavy and specialized fixed mountings and it also saw some use as a naval weapon aboard ship. During World War I the Schwarzlose was also pressed into service as an anti-aircraft gun and as such it was deployed using a variety of often improvised mountings. Use as a fortification weapon The 7/12 machine gun with water jacket cover. After World War I the Schwarzlose equipped the armed forces of Czechoslovakia, where it was adapted (vz. 7/24) and manufactured (vz. 24) as the těžký kulomet vz. 7/24 (heavy machine gun model 7/24) by the Janeček factory (adapted from 8 mm calibre to standard Czechoslovak munition 7,92 Mauser). When Czechoslovakia started building fortifications against Nazi Germany in 1935-1938, light fortifications, known as types 36 and 37, were partially armed with the Schwarzlose vz. 7/24. Use as an aircraft gun Apart from its use as a heavy infantry machine gun and as an anti-aircraft weapon, the Schwarzlose saw service with the Austro-Hungarian Luftfahrtruppe during World War I as an aircraft machine gun, a role for which it was not entirely suited. The Schwarzlose was used both as a fixed forward firing gun and as a flexible, ring mounted, defensive weapon. Synchronizing the Schwarzlose for use in fighters turned out to be a difficult engineering challenge. A critical factor in synchronization is the time delay between the trigger movement and the moment when the bullet leaves the barrel, as during this delay the propeller will continue to rotate, moving over an angle that also varies with engine rpm. Because of the relatively long delay time of the Schwarzlose M7/12, the synchronization systems that were developed could be operated safely only in a narrow band of engine rpm. Therefore, the Austro- Hungarian fighters were equipped with large and prominent tachometers in the cockpit. The M16 version of the gun could be synchronized with greater accuracy, but a widened engine rpm restriction still had to be respected, except for aircraft equipped with Daimler synchronization gear. The result was never entirely satisfactory and Austro-Hungarian aircraft thus armed usually carried the Kravics indicator to warn the pilot of a malfunction in the synchronization gear. The Kravics propeller hit indicator consisted of electric wiring wrapped around the critical area of the propeller blades, connected to a light in the cockpit by a slip ring on the propeller shaft. If the light went out, the pilot knew the propeller had been hit., Until these synchronization problems had been overcome, it was not uncommon to see the Schwarzlose deployed in a removable forward firing Type-II VK gun container which had been developed by the Luftfahrtruppe's Versuchs Kompanie at Fischamend. The Type-II VK, which received the macabre nickname 'baby coffin' due to its shape, is remarkable in that it was possibly the first example of what today would be called a gun pod. It was usually mounted on the centerline of the upper wing of Austro-Hungarian fighters and two-seat combat aircraft during the early phases of World War I and remained in use on two-seat combat aircraft until the end of the war. In its role as an aircraft weapon the Schwarzlose was initially used unmodified — other than that, the distinctive cone shaped flash-hider seen on most of the infantry weapons was removed. The Schwarzlose was further modified for aircraft use, much as the German Empire's own lMG 08 Spandau ordnance had been modified early in 1915, by cutting slots into the water jacket's sheetmetal to facilitate air cooling. In 1916 the water jacket was removed entirely and the resulting weapon was re-designated as the Schwarzlose MG-16 and MG-16A when fitted with a stronger spring and a blowback enhancer to increase the guns cyclic rate which was eventually brought up to 880 rounds per minute in some versions of the MG-16A. As a defensive ring mounted gun the Schwarzlose usually retained its normal twin firing handles and trigger button although some MG-16 aircraft guns were fitted with enlarged pistol shaped handles and a handgun style trigger. All ring mounted defensive guns were equipped with specialized sights and a box for the ammunition belt which allowed quick and trouble-free reloading. After the end of World War I the Schwarzlose saw limited use as an aircraft gun with various East European air forces. The best known post war operator of the Schwarzlose was probably the Polish air force who acquired and used significant numbers of surplus Austro-Hungarian aircraft and used them against Soviet forces during the Polish-Bolshevik War. The Schwarzlose was, however, quickly phased out of service as an aircraft weapon when more suitable equipment became available. Variants The first variant, designated M.7.

It is set outside the Known Space universe of many of Niven's stories, but is otherwise fairly representative of his 1970s hard science fiction novels. The main part of the novel was originally serialized in Galaxy magazine as \\"Children of the State\\"; another part was originally published as the short story \\"Rammer\\". A World Out of Time placed fifth in the annual Locus Poll in 1977.  Plot summary  Jerome Branch Corbell has incurable cancer and is cryogenically frozen in the year 1970 in the faint hope of a future cure. His body is revived in 2190 by an oppressive, totalitarian global government called \\"The State\\". His personality and memories are extracted (destroying his body in the process) and transferred into the body of a mindwiped criminal. After awakening, he is continually evaluated by Peerssa, a \\"checker\\", who has to decide whether he is worth keeping. With the threat of his own mindwiping looming, Corbell works hard to pass the various tests. Peerssa decides that Corbell is a loner and born tourist, making him an ideal candidate to pilot a one-man Bussard ramjet, finding and seeding suitable planets as the first step to terraforming them. Discovering it is a one-way trip and disgusted with the State's treatment of him as an expendable commodity, Corbell hijacks the ship and takes it to the center of the galaxy. (It was at this point that the original short story ended.) Peerssa fails to talk him out of it. Peerssa and The State resort to subterfuge; an artificial intelligence program based on Peerssa's personality is secretly transferred into the ship's computer using the link with Earth. Though the Peerssa AI opposes the detour, it cannot disobey Corbell's direct orders. After a lengthy journey (including a close approach to the super-massive black hole at the galactic axis), possible only due to the suspended animation devices on board, Corbell returns to the solar system. Although only about 150 years have passed on the ship, three million years have elapsed on Earth, due to relativistic time dilation. At first, he is confused and initially believes they might have come to the wrong system because it has changed considerably; the Sun has apparently evolved into a red giant and what might be Earth is in orbit around a super-hot Jupiter. Having followed a message clearly from humans (warning not to visit other human-occupied star systems), and being too old to survive going anywhere else, Corbell puts the ship into orbit around what is surely the Earth. The Earth's climate has changed, especially its surface temperature; the poles are now temperate, while the former temperate zones reach temperatures of over 50 degrees Celsius (120+ degrees Fahrenheit). The Earth's axial tilt is still 23.5 degrees so the poles experience 6 years of night and 6 years of day. Almost all remaining life on Earth has adapted to live in Antarctica. Elsewhere life is extinct except for some evidence of biological activity in the Himalayan mountains. When Corbell lands (in a modified biological probe), he is captured by Mirelly-Lyra, who is also a returned star ship pilot and refugee from the past—though from Corbell's (and Peerssa's) future. She explains that the human species has fragmented; it is dominated by a race of immortal, permanently pre-adolescent males (the Boys), who are created by advanced medical techniques. Some time in the past, they had defeated the equally immortal (though now extinct) Girls, in the ultimate war of the sexes. The Boys have enslaved the dikta, who are unmodified humans (though they have evolved somewhat), from whom they take boys to replenish their ranks. Mirelly-Lyra had initially been a captive toy of the Girls. After their downfall, she obsessively searched in vain for the lost adult- immortality treatment, extending her life as much as possible using her own drugs and a form of zero-time stasis while waiting for another returning star ship and potential help. Because she could not stop the aging process entirely, she is an old crone by the time she finds Corbell. He manages to escape from her, only to be caught by the Boys, who take him to a dikta settlement. Corbell finds out that the solar system was engineered into its new configuration by the Girls in order to move the Earth to a habitable distance from the enlarged Sun (caused by war with colonies), and that an orbital error caused Jupiter to overheat and triggered the war that killed the Girls. With Gording, the dikta leader, Corbell escapes once more. Eventually, Corbell discovers the adult-immortality treatment, albeit by accident and only realizing it after he himself has been exposed to it. He uses it to enlist Mirelly-Lyra's help, which in turn finally gives him full control of his ship's technology (the hostile Peerssa has decided that the woman is the last survivor of the State and will only obey her). The planet Uranus has been discovered to have been maneuvered to pass by the Earth and adjust its orbit by Peerssa the AI. Corbell arranges for the Earth's distance from the super- heated Jupiter to be adjusted by Peersa to lower the Earth's temperature without destroying the plants and animals that have adapted to the extreme conditions. As the novel closes, he is plotting to liberate the dikta and enable them to regain control of their own destiny.  Literary significance and reception  The New York Times reviewer Gerald Jonas wrote that, in a novel filled with wonders, \\"Niven describes everything in the toneless accents of a tour guide on a fall foliage caravan. . . . after a while, the wonders begin to blur together [and] the reader begins to yearn for less matter and more art.\\"\\"Of Things to Come\\", The New York Times Book Review, October 17, 1976 Jerry L. Parsons in his review for the Library Journal said that A World Out of Time was reminiscent in parts of 2001: A Space Odyssey and To Your Scattered Bodies Go. He wrote, \\"a wonderfully escapist adventure, this story has a minimum of character development and description, but a maximum of excitement.\\" Geoff Ryman has described A World Out of Time as one of Niven's \\"hardest\\" works, but went on to specify that many of the concepts Niven used as plot points were \\"disintegrated by later research\\".Notes from Novacon 40, transcribed by Nelson Cunnington, from Ansible 281, posted December 2010, retrieved February 28, 2010 Robert Silverberg reviewed World unfavorably, terming it a \\"rambling, loose-jointed novel that seems to have assembled itself out of the handiest pieces in the heap while its author's attention was elsewhere.\\"\\"Books,\\" Cosmos, July 1977, p.35. Richard A. Lupoff was similarly critical, saying Niven \\"starts out like a Saturn V and all too soon fizzles like a Vanguard. . . . this is either a novel that begins well and then goes dreadfully wrong or a cobbling together of several novelettes the first of which is a beauty and the others of which are stinkers.\\"\\"Lupoff's Book Week\\", Algol 28, 1977, p.55.  Awards and nominations  A World Out of Time was a nominee for the following awards: * 1977 Locus Award in the Novel category (5th Place) * 1977 Ditmar Award in the international science fiction category Connections to other Niven works The story does not take place in Niven's Known Space. It does share the same setting as two of his other novels, The Integral Trees (1983) and The Smoke Ring (1987) as well as the short story \\"The Kiteman\\". All three novels feature the totalitarian interplanetary State, \\"corpsicle\\" personality transfers into mind-wiped criminals without civil rights, police-like enforcers called \\"checkers,\\" and a computer artificial intelligence personality in charge of a ramship expedition that seeds life in other systems to prepare them for human colonization. Literary reference The protagonist's name is a play on that of the author James Branch Cabell, whom Niven also mentions in some of his other writing.

The grandson of Martha Washington and step-grandson and adopted son of George Washington, he and his sister Eleanor grew up at Mount Vernon and in the Washington presidential households. Upon reaching age 21, Custis inherited a large fortune from his late father, John Parke Custis, including a plantation in what is now Arlington, Virginia. High atop a hill overlooking the Potomac River and Washington, D.C., he built the Greek Revival mansion Arlington House (1803–18), as a shrine to George Washington. There he preserved and displayed many of Washington's belongings. Custis wrote historical plays about Virginia, delivered a number of patriotic addresses, and was the author of the posthumously-published Recollections and Private Memoirs of George Washington (1860). His daughter, Mary Anna Randolph Custis, married Robert E. Lee. They inherited Arlington House and the plantation surrounding it, but the property was soon confiscated by the federal government during the Civil War. After the Civil War, the property was deemed to have been illegally confiscated by the US Supreme Court and was ordered returned to Lee's heirs. After regaining Arlington Custis Lee immediately sold it back to the federal government for its fair market value. Arlington House is now a museum, interpreted by the National Park Service as the Robert E. Lee Memorial. The remainder of Arlington plantation is now Fort Myer and Arlington National Cemetery. Early life Mellon Collection, National Gallery of Art \\"The Washington Family\\" by Edward Savage, painted between 1789 and 1796, shows (from left to right): George Washington Parke Custis, George Washington, Nelly Custis, Martha Washington, and an enslaved servant (probably William Lee or Christopher Sheels). Custis was born on April 30, 1781, at his mother's family home, Mount Airy, which survives in Rosaryville State Park in Prince George's County, Maryland. He initially lived with his parents John Parke Custis and Eleanor Calvert Custis, and his sisters Elizabeth Parke Custis, Martha Parke Custis and Nelly Custis, at Abingdon Plantation (part of which is now Ronald Reagan National Airport, in Arlington County), which his father had purchased in 1778. However, six months after Custis's birth, his father died of \\"camp fever\\" at Yorktown, Virginia, shortly after the British army surrendered there. Custis's grandmother, Martha Dandridge Custis Washington, had been widowed in 1757, and married George Washington in January 1759. His father had grown up at Mount Vernon. Following John Parke Custis's death, George Washington never formally adopted the Custis grandchildren; GWP Custis and his sister Nelly however grew up at Mount Vernon and were treated as they were his adopted grandchildren. in Custis's two oldest sisters, Elizabeth and Martha, remained at Abingdon with their widowed mother, who in 1783 married Dr. David Stuart, an Alexandria physician and associate of George Washington.The Stuarts subsequently had 16 children while living at Abingdon, Hope Park, and Ossian Hall in Northern Virginia. The Washingtons brought Custis and Nelly, 8 and 10 years old, respectively, to New York City in 1789, to live in the first and second presidential mansions. Following the transfer of the national capital to Philadelphia, the original \\"First Family\\" occupied the President's House from 1790 to 1797. Custis (nicknamed \\"Wash\\") attended—but did not graduate from—Philadelphia Academy (the preparatory school of what is now the University of Pennsylvania); the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University); and St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland. George Washington repeatedly expressed frustration with young Custis, as well as his own inability to improve the youth's attitude. Upon young Custis's return to Mount Vernon after only one term at St. John's, George Washington sent him to his mother and stepfather (Dr. David Stuart) at Hope Park, writing \\"He appears to me to be moped and Stupid, says nothing, and is always in some hole or corner excluded from the Company.\\" At Google Books. In January 1799, Custis was commissioned as a cornet in the United States Army and was promoted to second lieutenant in March. He served as aide-de-camp to General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and was honorably discharged on June 15, 1800. Building Arlington House When Custis came of age, he inherited large amounts of money, land, and property from the estates of his father, John Parke Custis, and grandfather Daniel Parke Custis. Upon Martha Washington's death in 1802, he received a bequest from her (as he had upon George Washington's death in 1799) as well as his father's former plantations because of the termination of Martha's life estate.These included about 80 slaves from the John Parke Custis estate; 35 dower slaves at Mount Vernon from the Daniel Parke Custis estate; Elisha, the one slave Martha Washington owned outright; and about 40 more slaves from the John Parke Custis estate following his mother's 1811 death. See: Henry Weincek, An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2003), p. 383n. See also: Slavery by the Numbers However, Martha's executor, Bushrod Washington, refused to sell to Custis the Mount Vernon estate on which Custis had been living and which Bushrod Washington (George Washington's nephew) had inherited. Custis thereupon moved into a four-room, 80-year-old house on land inherited from his father, who had called it \\"Mount Washington\\".Rudy, p. 15. Almost immediately, Custis began constructing Arlington House on his land, which at the time was within Alexandria County (now Arlington County) in the District of Columbia. Hiring George Hadfield as architect, he constructed a mansion that was the first example of Greek Revival architecture in America. He located the building on a prominent hill overlooking the Georgetown- Alexandria Turnpike (at the approximate location of the present Eisenhower Drive in Arlington National Cemetery), the Potomac River, and the growing Washington City on the opposite side of the river. Using slave labor and materials on site, and interrupted by the War of 1812 (and material shortages after the British burned the American capital city), Custis finally completed the mansion's exterior in 1818.Rudy, pp. 16–18, 35–36. Custis intended the mansion to serve as a living memorial to George Washington, and included design elements similar to Mt. Vernon's.Rudy, pp. 9, 31. He then gained a reputation for inviting many guests for various celebrations and social events at the mansion, where he displayed relics from Mt. Vernon, although the interior was not completed (and renovated) until occupancy by Robert E. Lee's family (including Custis's grandsons/heirs) in the 1850s.Rudy, p. 37. Later life In 1802, the Washington Jockey Club sought a site for a new race course, as its old site—which occupied land from the rear of what is now the site of Decatur House at H Street and Jackson Place, across Seventeenth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, to Twentieth Street, where the Eisenhower Executive Office Building sits today—was suffering encroachment from the growth of the Federal City. Under the leadership of John Tayloe III and Charles Carnan Ridgely, and with the support of Custis, Gen. John Peter Van Ness, Dr. William Thornton, John D. Threlkeld of Georgetown and George Calvert of Riversdale, Bladensburg, Maryland, the races were moved to Holmstead Farm's one-mile oval track on Meridian Hill, south of Columbia Road, between Fourteenth and Sixteenth streets. On July 7, 1804, Custis married Mary Lee Fitzhugh. Of their four children, only one daughter, Mary Anna Randolph Custis, survived to maturity. She married Robert E. Lee at Arlington House on June 30, 1831. Lee's father, Henry Lee III (Light-Horse Harry Lee) had delivered the eulogy at George Washington's December 18, 1799, funeral. Like many prominent White men of his time, Custis had White children born through marriage and Black offspring born of rape. Maria Carter was the daughter of Custis and an enslaved woman named Arianna Carter. In 1821, Custis allowed Maria Carter to marry Charles Syphax, a Mount Vernon enslaved man he inherited from his grandmother, in the mansion’s parlor. (It was a religious ceremony only; enslaved people could not legally marry.) https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/08/24/arlington-house-remove- robert-e-lee-name/ During the War of 1812, Custis assisted in the firing of an artillery piece to help defend Washington, D.C., from the British during the Battle of Bladensburg. At Google Books. He also delivered and published an address condemning the death of Revolutionary War general James Lingan who was killed by a Baltimore mob for defending an anti-war publisher's right to oppose the war.Oration by Mr. Custis, of Arlington; with an Account of the Funeral Solemnities in Honor of the Lamented Gen. James M. Lingan (1812) In 1815, Custis was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. During the 1820s, Custis was an active member of the American Colonization Society—an organization that supported the colonization of free blacks in Africa, particularly in Liberia. Custis eventually lost interest in the Society, but his wife and daughter continued to support it for many years. Colonization was generally unpopular with African American slaves. Of the Arlington slaves, only William Burke and his family chose to move to Liberia. In 1854, William and Rosabella Burke and their children left Arlington House for Monrovia, Liberia. Rosabella continued to write to Mrs. Lee and named a new daughter \\"Martha\\" in tribute to the family. One biographer claimed Lafayette and his son Georges Washington de La Fayette visited Custis at Mount Vernon in 1825, although Custis was then living at Arlington House. In 1846, the federal government retroceded to the state of Virginia the portion of the District of Columbia that was south and west of the Potomac River, which at the time contained the city and county of Alexandria. Custis initially opposed the retrocession, but later spoke in support of it. Alexandrians then elected Custis to represent the area in the Virginia General Assembly when the legislature considered the retrocession. The General Assembly approved the retrocession on March 13, 1847. At DC Vote. On July 4, 1848, Custis attended the ceremony celebrating the laying of the cornerstone of the Washington Monument by Freemasons. Along with President James K. Polk, the ceremony attracted 20,000 other spectators. At Google Books. On July 4, 1850, Custis dedicated a stone that the people of the District of Columbia had donated to the Monument at a ceremony that President Zachary Taylor attended, five days before Taylor died from food poisoning. At Google Books. In 1853, the writer Benson John Lossing visited Custis at Arlington House.See the Cornell University Library transcription of Harper's New Monthly Magazine article: (starting on page 433). Four of the Custis paintings mentioned in the Harper's article(Battle of Germantown/Battle of Trenton/Battle of Princeton/Washington at Yorktown) were republished in American Heritage magazine in February 1966. Custis achieved some distinction as an orator and playwright. In addition to the Lingan eulogy, he delivered The Celebration of the Russian Victories, in Georgetown, District of Columbia; on June 5, 1813 (1813). Two of Custis's plays, The Indian Prophecy; or Visions of Glory (1827) and Pocahontas; or, The Settlers of Virginia (1830), were published during his lifetime. Other plays included The Rail Road (1828), The Eighth of January, or, Hurra for the Boys of the West! (ca. 1830), North Point, or, Baltimore Defended (1833), and Montgomerie, or, The Orphan of a Wreck (1836). Custis wrote a series of biographical essays about his adoptive father that were compiled and posthumously published in 1859 and 1860, after his own death in 1857, as Recollections and Private Memoirs of Washington.(1) At Google Books. (2) At Google Books. Other family ties Arms of the Barons Baltimore Arms of George Washington Parke Custis Custis was descended from a number of aristocratic colonial era families, as well as, through his mother Eleanor Calvert Custis Stuart, British nobility and, very distantly, from the royal houses of Hanover and Stuart. His mother was descended from Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore, and Henry Lee of Ditchley, one of whose descendants was Edward Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield, who married Charlotte Fitzroy, an illegitimate daughter of Charles II by one of his mistresses, Barbara Palmer. It is believed Custis was descended from George I's natural daughter Melusina von der Schulenburg, Countess of Walsingham, whose extra-marital liaison with Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, produced a son, Benedict Swingate Calvert, who was Custis's maternal grandfather. Custis's father, John Parke Custis, was the son of Martha Washington by her marriage to Daniel Parke Custis. Custis's sister Eleanor \\"Nelly\\" Parke Custis Lewis married George Washington's nephew, Lawrence Lewis. As a wedding present, Washington gave Nelly a section of Mount Vernon's land, on which the Lewises established Woodlawn plantation and constructed Woodlawn Mansion. The National Park Service has listed Woodlawn on the National Register of Historic Places. Another sister of Custis, Martha Parke Custis Peter, married Thomas Peter. Using Martha's inheritances from George and Martha Washington, the Peters purchased property in Georgetown within the District of Columbia. The couple then constructed the Tudor Place mansion on the property. Tudor Place and its grounds, which the National Park Service has listed on the National Register of Historic Places, contain features that resemble those of Arlington House and Woodlawn. In 1826, Custis admitted the paternity of Maria Carter, who had been born in 1803 to Arianna \\"Airy\\" Carter (1776–1880), an African-American slave maid at the Arlington estate who had earlier resided at Mount Vernon as a slave of Martha Washington. Maria lived and worked at Arlington as a slave until 1826, when she married Charles Syphax, a slave who oversaw the dining room of Arlington House. Soon after Maria's marriage, Custis freed her and gave her a plot in the southwest corner of the Arlington estate. Maria subsequently raised ten children on her property. Tall trees and stretches of grassland reportedly surrounded Maria's white cottage.(1) (2) Custis is also believed to have fathered a girl named Lucy with the slave Caroline Branham.. Custis freed members of the Brannan family. October 23, 1820, Manumission from William Costin to Leanthe Brannan, Washington, D.C., Archives, Liber AZ50, folio 229 (old folio 294) (“Whereas George WP Custis by an instrument of writing under his hand and Seal bearing the date of Eleventh of October one thousand Eight hundred and twenty, did bargain, sell and confirm unto me a certain mulatto woman slave, Leanthe Brannan, about twenty- eight years of age.”) Death and legacy Arlington House from a pre-1861 sketch, published in 1875 Arlington House in the 2000s Gravesite of George Washington Park Custis Custis died on October 10, 1857, and was buried at Arlington alongside his wife, Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis, who had died four years earlier. Custis's will provided that: * Arlington plantation (approx. 1100 acres) and its contents, including Custis's collection of George Washington's artifacts and memorabilia, would be bequeathed to his only surviving child, Mary Anna Randolph Custis (the wife of Robert E. Lee) for her natural life, and upon her death, to his eldest grandson George Washington Custis Lee; * White House plantation, in New Kent County, and Romancoke plantation, in King William County, (approx. 4000 acres each) would be bequeathed to his other two grandsons, William Henry Fitzhugh Lee (\\"Rooney Lee\\") and Robert Edward Lee, Jr., respectively; * Cash gifts of $10,000 each would be provided to his four granddaughters, based on the incomes from the plantations and the sales of other smaller properties (some properties could not be sold until after the Civil War and it is doubtful that $10,000 each was ever fully paid); * Certain property in \\"square No. 21, Washington City\\" (possibly located between present-day Foggy Bottom and the Potomac River) to be bequeathed to Robert E. Lee \\"and his heirs\\"; * Custis's slaves, numbered around 200, were to be freed once the legacies and debts from his estate were paid, but no later than five years after his death.Fulfilled by Robert E. Lee, executor, in the winter of 1862. see http://files.usgwarchives.net/va/spotsylvania/wills/c2320001.txt Custis' death impacted the careers of Robert E. Lee and his two elder sons on the cusp of the American Civil War. Then-Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee, named as the will's executor, took a two-year leave from his army post in Texas to settle the estate. During this period Lee was ordered to lead troops to quash John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry. By 1859, Lee's eldest son, George Washington Custis Lee, got transferred to an army position in Washington, D.C., so that he could care for Arlington plantation, where his mother and sisters were living. Lee's second son, Rooney Lee, resigned his army commission, got married, and took over farming White House and Romancoke plantations near Richmond. Robert E. Lee was able to leave for Texas to resume his army career in February 1860. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Union Army forces seized the Arlington Plantation for strategic reasons (protection of the river and national capital). The United States government then confiscated the Custis estate for non-payment of taxes. In 1863, a \\"Freedman's Village\\" was established there for freed slaves. At arlcivilwar.net: Arlington's Civil War Memorial Website In 1864, Montgomery C. Meigs, Quartermaster General of the United States Army, appropriated some parts of Arlington Plantation for use as a military burial ground. After the Civil War ended, George Washington Custis Lee sued and recovered title to the Arlington Plantation from the United States government in 1882, when the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of Lee in United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196. Lee then sold the property back to the United States government for $150,000. Arlington House, built by Custis to honor George Washington, is now the Robert E. Lee Memorial. It is restored and open to the public under the auspices of the National Park Service, while the Department of Defense controls Fort Myer and Arlington National Cemetery on the remainder of the Arlington Plantation.

Ordinarily the strands are twisted or woven, but no twisting is shown in this diagram. Litz wire is a special type of multistrand wire or cable used in electronics to carry alternating current (AC) at radio frequencies. The wire is designed to reduce the skin effect and proximity effect losses in conductors used at frequencies up to about 1 MHz. It consists of many thin wire strands, individually insulated and twisted or woven together, following one of several carefully prescribed patterns often involving several levels (groups of twisted wires are twisted together, etc.). The result of these winding patterns is to equalize the proportion of the overall length over which each strand is at the outside of the conductor. This has the effect of distributing the current equally among the wire strands, reducing the resistance. Litz wire is used in high Q inductors for radio transmitters and receivers operating at low frequencies, induction heating equipment and switching power supplies. The term litz wire originates from Litzendraht (coll. Litze), German for braided/stranded wireSee English translation of Litzendraht. See translation of Litze (lace, strand, braiding, braid on military uniform) and translation of Draht (wire, filament, strand). See also German translations of wire. or woven wire., , and http://www.litz-wire.com/applications.html translate Litzendraht to woven wire Principle of operation Litz wire reduces the increase in resistance of wire that takes place at higher frequencies due to two effects: skin effect and proximity effect. =Skin effect= The resistance of a conductor depends on its cross-sectional area; a conductor with a larger area has a lower resistance for a given length. However at high frequencies, alternating current (AC) does not penetrate deeply into conductors due to eddy currents induced in the material; it tends to flow near the surface. This is called skin effect. Therefore in a solid conductor like a wire, current tends to flow in a layer or annulus at the surface, and less current flows through the material near the center of the wire. Since less of the cross-sectional area of the wire is being used, the resistance of the wire is greater than it is for direct current (DC). The higher the frequency of the current, the smaller the depth to which the current penetrates, and the current is \\"crowded\\" into an increasingly smaller cross-sectional area along the surface, so the AC resistance of wire increases with frequency. The depth to which AC current penetrates in a conductor is determined by a parameter called the skin depth, which is the depth at which the current is reduced to 37% of its surface value. The skin depth decreases with frequency. At low frequencies at which the skin depth is larger than the diameter of the wire, the skin effect is negligible and the current distribution and resistance are virtually the same as at DC. As the frequency rises and the skin depth gets smaller than the wire diameter, skin effect becomes significant, the current is increasingly concentrated near the surface, and the resistance per unit length of wire increases above its DC value. Examples of skin depth in copper wire at different frequencies * At 60 Hz, the skin depth of a copper wire is about . * At 60,000 Hz (60 kHz), the skin depth of copper wire is about . * At 6,000,000 Hz (6 MHz) Litz wire is impractical at 6MHz; see . the skin depth of copper wire is about . Round conductors such as wire or cables larger than a few skin depths do not conduct much current near their axis, so the metal located at the central part of the wire is not used effectively. =Proximity effect= In applications where multiple wires carrying the same current lie side-by-side, such as in inductor and transformer windings, a second similar effect called proximity effect causes additional current crowding, resulting in an additional increase in the resistance of the wire with frequency. In two wires running parallel next to each other, with the same alternating current flowing in both wires, the magnetic field of the adjacent wire induces longitudinal eddy currents in the wire which causes the current to be concentrated in a narrow strip on the side adjacent to the other wire. This has a similar effect as the skin effect; the current is crowded into a smaller cross-sectional area of the wire, so the resistance increases. =How Litz wire works= One technique to reduce the resistance is to place more of the conductive material near the surface where the current is by replacing the wire with a hollow copper tube. The larger surface area of the tube conducts the current with much less resistance than a solid wire with the same cross- sectional area would. The tank coils of high power radio transmitters are often made of copper tubing, silver plated on the outside, to reduce resistance. However tubing is not flexible and requires special tools to bend and shape. Litz wire is another method, which employs a stranded wire with individually insulated conductors (forming a bundle). Each thin conductor is less than a skin-depth, so an individual strand does not suffer an appreciable skin effect loss. The strands must be insulated from each other—otherwise all the wires in the bundle would short together, behave like a single large wire, and still have skin effect problems. Furthermore, the strands cannot occupy the same radial position in the bundle over long distances: the electromagnetic effects that cause the skin effect would still disrupt conduction. The weaving or twisting pattern of the wires in the bundle is designed so that the individual strands are on the outside of the bundle for a distance (where the EM field changes are smaller and the strand sees low resistance), and are inside for a distance (where the EM field changes are the strongest and the resistance is higher). If each strand has a comparable impedance, current is distributed equally among every strand within the cable. This allows the interior of the litz wire to contribute to the overall conductivity of the bundle. Another way to explain the benefit of litz braiding is as follows: the magnetic fields generated by current flowing in the strands are in directions such that they have a reduced tendency to generate an opposing electromagnetic field in the other strands. Thereby, for the wire as a whole, the skin effect and associated power losses when used in high-frequency applications are reduced. The ratio of distributed inductance to distributed resistance is increased, relative to a solid conductor, resulting in a higher Q factor at these frequencies. Effectiveness provides an expression for the ratio of resistance to alternating current to resistance to direct current for an isolated litz wire.Terman cites It does not apply to windings with multiple turns. An expression for the resistance ratio in windings is given by at Eqn 2 and Appendix A (page 289). Litz wire is very effective below 500 kHz; it is rarely used above 2 MHz as it is much less effective there. At frequencies above about 1 MHz, the benefits become gradually offset by the effect of parasitic capacitance between the strands. At microwave frequencies, the skin depth is much smaller than the diameter of the strands, and the current that is forced through the inner strands induces strong eddy currents in the outer strands, which negates the benefits of litz wire to the point where it performs much worse than solid wire of the same diameter. Litz wire has a higher impedance per unit cross-sectional area but litz wires can be used at thicker cable sizes, hence reducing or maintaining cable impedance at higher frequencies.Skindepth, Litz wire, braided conductors and resistance, W8JI. Construction of litz wires usually involves extremely fine wires often available with a silver plate or solid silver. The individual strands often make use of a low temperature lacquer coating that typically requires silver solder iron temperatures to melt - remove when making connections. The bundles of wires can also use silk outer insulation. Applications Disassembled induction cooker showing litz wire coil. Litz wire is used to make inductors and transformers, especially for high frequency applications where the skin effect is more pronounced and proximity effect can be an even more severe problem. Litz wire is one kind of stranded wire, but, in this case, the reason for its use is not the usual one of avoiding complete wire breakage due to material fatigue. Litz wire is frequently found in power applications in frequencies ranging between lower tens to higher hundreds kilohertz, namely induction cookers and transmitters of inductive chargers (e.g. the Qi standard). Multiple parallel twisted strands of enameled wires can be found also in transformers in some switching power supplies. =WWVB transmitting station= NIST uses litz wire in the time code broadcasting station WWVB. The station transmits on 60 kHz. Litz wire is used for the helix and variometer in both helix houses. It consists of 9 × 5 × 5 × 27 (totaling 6075) strands of #36 AWG ( diameter) magnet wire and multiple layers of cotton, hemp, and plastic insulation, in a cable ¾ inch (19 mm) in diameter, totaling 151,875 circular mils of copper.

This slow-growing tree is named after the heaviness and hardness of its timber. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental due to its graceful shape, grayish-green foliage with a beautiful pink to red flush of drooping young leaves, and large, fragrant white flowers. It is native to wet, tropical parts of Sri Lanka, India, southern Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Indochina, the Philippines, Malaysia and Sumatra, where it grows in evergreen forests, especially in river valleys. In the eastern Himalayas and Western Ghats in India it grows up to altitudes of , while in Sri Lanka up to . It is national tree of Sri Lanka and state flower of Tripura and Mizoram. Description right The tree can grow over tall, often buttressed at the base with a trunk up to in diameter. The bark of younger trees has an ash grey color with flaky peelings, while of old trees the bark is dark ash-grey with a red-brown blaze. It has simple, opposite, narrow, oblong to lanceolate, blue-grey to dark green leaves that are long and wide, with a whitish underside. The emerging young leaves are red to yellowish pink and drooping. The branches are slender, terete and glabrous. The bisexual flowers are in diameter, with four white petals and a center of numerous orange yellow stamens. The fruit is an ovoid to globose capsule with one to two seeds. History of the tree in Sri Lanka In the dry zone areas of Sri Lanka—where ironwood trees normally do not grow wild, large, old ironwood trees can be seen around the remains of ancient Buddhist monasteries on rocky hills around Dambulla such as Na Uyana Aranya, Namal Uyana, Na-golla Aranya, Pidurangala near Sigiriya, Kaludiya Pokuna near Kandalama, and Ritigala. They are probably the descendants of trees planted as ornamentals in the monasteries in ancient times during the Anuradhapura period. Older trees form suckers or shoots from the base of the trunk, which become new trees when the old trunk falls down; therefore the bases and roots of some ironwood trees in these sites might be very old. In Theravada Buddhism, this tree is said to have used as the tree for achieved enlightenment, or Bodhi by four Lord Buddhas called \\"Mangala - මංගල\\", \\"Sumana - සුමන\\", \\"Revatha - රේවත\\", and \\"Sobhitha - සෝභිත\\". Uses As the English name indicates, the wood of this tree is very heavy, hard and strong. The density is 940 to 1,195 kg/m3 (59 to 75 lb/ft3) at 15% moisture content. The colour is deep dark red. It is hard to saw and is mainly used for railroad ties and heavy structural timber. In Sri Lanka the pillars of the 14th century Embekke Shrine near Kandy are made of iron tree wood. The flowers, leaves, seeds and roots are used as herbal medicines in India, Malaysia, etc. and in Nag Champa incense sticks. In eastern state of Assam, India, its seeds were also used for lighting purpose in evening for day to day purpose (while mustard oil for religious and health and culinary purposes) before the introduction of kerosene by the British. Taxonomical status Mesua ferrea is a complex species and has recently been split into several species and varieties. A.J.G.H. Kostermans and Gunatilleke et al. call the tree described in this article Mesua nagassarium. Kostermans lists several subspecies of Mesua nagassarium. These authors list Mesua ferrea as a separate species that is endemic to Sri Lanka and is a small, 15 meters high tree that grows near streams and in marshes in the Southwest of Sri Lanka, where it is called \\"Diya Na\\" in Sinhala, meaning \\"Water Na Tree\\". This \\"Diya Na\\" is not cultivated. Gunatilleke et al. (p. 139), however, remark in a footnote: \\"In the most recent revision diya na is named as Mesua thwaitesii and na as Mesua ferrea\\". Kostermans and Gunatilleke et al. classify Mesua ferrea in the family Clusiaceae, while in the AgroForestryTree Database it is allocated to the Guttiferae.

He was a painter, animator, calligrapher, muralist, ceramicist, lithographer and kite maker, as well as a set designer and storyboard artist. One of the most-influential and celebrated Asian-American artists of the 20th century, Wong was also a film production illustrator, who worked for Disney and Warner Brothers. He was a muralist for the Works Progress Administration (WPA), as well as a greeting card artist for Hallmark Cards. Most notably, he was the lead production illustrator on Disney's 1942 film Bambi, taking inspiration from Song dynasty art. He also served in the art department of many films, either as a set designer or storyboard artist, such as Rebel Without a Cause (1955), Around the World in 80 Days (1956), Rio Bravo (1959), The Music Man (1962), PT 109 (1963), The Great Race (1965), The Green Berets (1968), and The Wild Bunch (1969), among others. Wong retired from the film industry in the late 1960s, but continued his work as an artist, spending most of his time designing kites. He also continued to paint, sketch, and design ceramics well into his 90s. He was the subject of the 2015 documentary film, Tyrus, by filmmaker Pamela Tom. Wong died on December 30, 2016, at the age of 106. Early life On October 25, 1910, Wong was born as Wong Gen Yeo, in Taishan, Guangdong, China. Wong's father was \\"Ben\\" Sy Po Wong (1871-1935). Wong's mother was Lee See. On December 30, 1919, Wong and his father boarded the ship S.S. China and sailed to California, U.S. In 1920, when he was nine years old, Wong and his father immigrated to the United States, and never again came into contact with his mother and sister. Wong was initially held at the Angel Island Immigration Station, due to the Chinese Exclusion Act. There he was separated from his father while he waited to be questioned about his identity. Because most Chinese immigration was prohibited under the Chinese Exclusion Act, Wong and his father had to immigrate illegally under assumed identities as \\"paper sons\\" of Chinese American sponsors. Wong's paper son name was Look Tai Yow. After a month, Wong was released from Angel Island. Wong and his father initially relocated to Sacramento. Wong and his father later moved the family to Los Angeles.\\"The Chinese 'Paper Son' Who Inspired The Look Of Disney's 'Bambi'\\". NPR. March 30, 2015. Wong's art was encouraged by his father who had him practice calligraphy every night, since they couldn't afford to give him an art education. While attending Benjamin Franklin Junior High in Pasadena, Wong's teachers noticed his artistic ability and he received a summer scholarship at the Otis Art Institute. Wong decided to leave junior high for a full-time scholarship at Otis. Wong's father survived on a more modest income, and Wong worked as a janitor at Otis College. He walked for miles to attend classes. He graduated from Otis in 1930 and began working in Hollywood.\\"Tyrus Wong (Animation)\\". Disney Legends. Retrieved May 12, 2010. While the alumnus page gives Wong's graduation year as 1932, the introduction to a video interview sponsored by the school refers to his attendance in 1935. Career L.A. Chinatown painted by Tyrus Wong and restored by Fu Ding Cheng (1984) Wong's career ranged from working as a Hallmark greeting card designer, to being a Warner Bros. film production illustrator (1942–1968), including drawing set designs and storyboards for several movies, and an inspirational sketch artist (1938–1941) for Disney. It was his lush pastels that served as inspiration for Bambi (1942), where he was the lead artist of the project. His background paintings for Bambi were inspired by Song dynasty classical Chinese paintings. Although credited as one of several background illustrators, his full contribution to the film was largely unknown for several decades. Shortly after finishing Bambi, Wong was fired from Disney studios as a consequence of the Disney animators' strike. After leaving Disney, Wong worked at Warner Brothers Studios for 26 years as a production illustrator. Later, he designed popular greeting cards for Hallmark Cards.

Frances Yates considered him to be a link between the philosophy of John Dee and Rosicrucianism. His name, in the spelling \\"Henricus Künraht\\" was used as a pseudonym for the 1670 publisher of the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus of Baruch Spinoza.  Life and education  Khunrath was born in Dresden, Saxony, the son of the merchant Sebastian Kunrat and his wife Anna in the year 1560. He was the younger brother of the Leipzig physician Conrad Khunrath.Albert Ladenburg: Heinrich Khunrath. In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie. Band 15. Duncker & Humblot, Leipzig 1882, S. 709. In the winter of 1570, he may have enrolled at the University of Leipzig under the name of Henricus Conrad Lips. The uncertainties surrounding his life stem from his supposed use of multiple names. It is certain that in May 1588, he matriculated at the University of Basel, Switzerland, earning his Medicinæ Doctor degree on 3 September 1588, after a defense of twenty-eight doctoral theses.  Career  Khunrath, a disciple of Paracelsus, practiced medicine in Dresden, Magdeburg, and Hamburg and may have held a professorial position in Leipzig. He travelled widely after 1588, including a stay at the Imperial court in Prague, home to the mystically inclined Habsburg emperor Rudolf II. Before reaching Prague he had met John Dee at Bremen on 27 May 1589, when Dee was on his way back to England from Bohemia. Khunrath praised Dee in his later works. During his court stay Khunrath met the alchemist Edward Kelley who had remained behind after he and Dee had parted company (Kelley was arrested on 30 April 1591 as an alleged imposter). In September 1591, Khunrath was appointed court physician to Count Rosemberk in Trebona. He probably met Johann Thölde while at Trebona, one of the suggested authors of the \\"Basilius Valentinus\\" treatises on alchemy.  Hermetic alchemist  \\"The First Stage of the Great Work,\\" better-known as the \\"Alchemist's Laboratory.\\" The drawing of the laboratory is credited to architectural painter Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527–1604) and shows Khunrath in his laboratory. Khunrath's brushes with John Dee and Thölde and Paracelsian beliefs led him to develop a Christianized natural magic, seeking to find the secret prima materia that would lead man into eternal wisdom. The Christianized view that Khunrath took was framed around his commitment to Lutheran theology. He also held that experience and observation were essential to practical alchemical research, as would a natural philosopher. His most famous work on alchemy is the Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae (Amphitheater of Eternal Wisdom), a work on the mystical aspects of that art, which contains the oft-seen engraving entitled \\"The First Stage of the Great Work\\", better- known as the \\"Alchemist's Laboratory\\". The book was first published at Hamburg in 1595, with four circular elaborate, hand-colored, engraved plates heightened with gold and silver which Khunrath designed and were engraved by Paullus van der Doort. The book was then made more widely available in an expanded edition with the addition of other plates published posthumously in Hanau in 1609. Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae is an alchemical classic, combining both Christianity and magic. In it, Khunrath showed himself to be an adept of spiritual alchemy and illustrated the many-staged and intricate path to spiritual perfection. Khunrath's work was important in Lutheran circles. John Warwick Montgomery has pointed out that Johann Arndt (1555–1621), who was the influential writer of Lutheran books of pietiesm and devotion, composed a commentary on Amphitheatrum. Some of the ideas in his works are Kabbalistic in nature and foreshadow Rosicrucianism.  Death  Khunrath may have encountered some opposition to his alchemical work because most of his publications on alchemy were published widely after his death. He died in either Dresden or Leipzig on 9 September 1605. The tension between spirituality and experiment in Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae brought about its condemnation by the Sorbonne in 1625.

He was a towering figure in U.S.-Chinese relations in the first half of the 20th century,\\"Ashes of the American Raj in China: John Leighton Stuart, Pearl S. Buck, and Edgar Snow,\\" by Charles W.

Early life  John Leighton Stuart was born in Hangzhou, China, on June 24, 1876, of Presbyterian missionary parents from the United States. His father was a third-generation Presbyterian minister from a distinguished family in Virginia and Kentucky (cousins included J.E.B. Stuart, John Todd Stuart and Mary Todd). They arrived in China in 1868, one of the first three Presbyterian ministers sent to China from the U.S. and the first Christian minister to preach in Hangzhou. Stuart's mother, Mary Horton (known affectionately as \\"Mother Stuart\\" in Hangzhou), founded the Hangzhou School for Girls, one of the first institutions of its kind in China. His mother's family had played a leading role in the American revolution in Boston, where her Yankee brand of Calvinism valued and promoted the education of women. Stuart had three younger brothers, David Todd (1878), Warren Horton (1880) and Robert Kirland (1883). Although an American by nationality who spoke English with a Southern accent, Stuart considered himself more Chinese than American. He spoke the Hangzhou dialect. At age 11, he left China to live for several years with relatives of his mother in Mobile, Alabama. At 16, he was sent to prep school in Virginia, where his outdated clothing and mid-19th century diction handed down from his missionary family in China made him a target for teasing by classmates. He graduated from Hampden-Sydney College and later Union Theological Seminary in Richmond, Virginia, where he aspired to become a missionary educator, inspired by the influence of Robert Elliott Speer.  Missionary and academic  Dr. Stuart at the campus he created in Beijing, 1946 In 1904, after his marriage, he returned to China with his wife, Aline Rodd, of New Orleans, and became a second-generation missionary in China. There, he helped to establish Hangzhou Yuying Academy, which later became Zhejiang University. Together, they had one child, Jack, who would become a Presbyterian minister also. In 1908, Stuart became a professor of New Testament Literature and Exegesis at the Nanking Theological Seminary. During his tenure, he published 'Essentials of New Testament Greek in Chinese' and 'Greek-Chinese-English Dictionary of the New Testament' (1918). His missionary work in China was sponsored by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's church in Washington, D.C., where Stuart preached and visited Wilson in the White House on home leave. Stuart's family had close ties with Wilson's family in Staunton, Virginia, where Stuart's father, John Linton, had been named after Wilson's uncle. In January 1919, Stuart became the first president of Yenching University. Over the next two decades, he built \\"the Beijing institution into China's greatest university\\" according to the historian John Pomfret.John Pomfret, The Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom.(New York: Henry Holt, 2016). He established financial, educational and physical foundations of the institution. He quickly made the university among the top universities, and the leading Christian institution, in China. He developed the Yenching campus (now home to Beijing University) in traditional Chinese architectural styles, even though many Chinese faculty preferred a campus more western in design. Stuart's hope was that China would one day absorb the institution as its own, rather than view it as an imposition of cultural imperialism. He also served on the Board of Trustees of Tsinghua University. He forged partnerships between Yenching and Harvard University, and in 1928 helped to create the Harvard–Yenching Institute, an important legacy in cultural exchange. He also formed partnerships with Princeton University, Wellesley College, and the University of Missouri. He cared much about students and teachers and their interactions and is remembered fondly by Yenching alumni for performing their weddings and for hosting an ongoing salon for student intellectuals on campus. Princeton awarded him an honorary doctorate of humane letters in 1933. In 1936, Yenching threw him a 60th birthday banquet, where kitchen and cleaning workers presented him with a plaque to hang above his door that read, \\"His kindness knows no class boundaries.\\"Stuart, \\"Fifty Years in China\\" (Random House, 1954) After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Yenching University ceased to exist. In 1952, Peking University relocated to the Yenching campus and absorbed most of its academic departments while Tsinghua University absorbed other departments. The official Beijing University history museum makes no mention of Stuart or the institution's western ties, yet the campus stands as his memorial.沙光 丨 别不了，司徒雷登：以“滴水”之情相报“涌泉”之恩, //https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BrJtMLHJvpQb1x9pEch2ag  Political Activities  \\"Stuart was the consummate friend of China,\\" wrote historian John Pomfret. \\"In the 1910s, he had argued that Americans should educate the Chinese more and proselytize them less. Stuart had been an early advocate of tearing up the unequal treaties with China, calling on the United States in 1925 to take the lead with 'an act of aggressive goodwill.\\"John Pomfret, The Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom. (New York: Henry Holt, 2016). He supported Chinese nationalism. He was sympathetic to students and faculty at Yenching who participated in May Fourth Movement (1919–1921) and May Thirtieth Movement (1925). He favored the Northern Expedition (1926-1927) against the warlord factions in Beijing. He led a protest with Yenching students against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria (1937). When the invaders overran Beijing in 1937, the Japanese ordered Stuart to fly the puppet regime flag at the Yenching University campus and offer his personal \\"thanks\\" to the Japanese military for the institution's \\"liberation.\\" Stuart, well known among Chinese as a man with a strong moral conscience, declined promptly, sending a terse note to the Japanese commander: \\"We are refusing to comply with these orders.\\"\\"J. Leighton Stuart Dead at 86; Ambassador to China 1946-1949,\\" The New York Times, Sept. 20, 1962. He resisted Japanese aggression in China in his sermons and speeches on campus and in travels throughout the country. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese incarcerated Stuart in Beijing for three years and eight months until the war ended. His deep involvement with China's politics, education and culture won him respect among Chinese intellectuals and students during the 1930s and 1940s. Wen Yiduo, a scholar whom Mao Zedong and the Chinese communists often praised, expressed his respect and admiration for John Leighton Stuart in his famous last speech. Yet, when Wen Yiduo's last speech was included in Chinese textbooks in Mainland China, the paragraph praising John Leighton Stuart was deleted.Why Mr. Wen's Speech was bowdlerized. (In Chinese)教科书:删得掉的文字 删不掉的“秘密” Wen Yiduo's original words are\\"John Leighton Stuart is a friend of Chinese people……an amiable scholar, and he really knows what Chinese people need.\\"In Chinese:“司徒雷登是中国人民的朋友…一位和蔼可亲的学者，真正知道中国人民的要求的。”  U.S. Ambassador to China  On July 4, 1946, Stuart was appointed the U.S. Ambassador to China and, in this position, worked in concert with George C. Marshall to mediate between Nationalists and Communists. He forged ties with the leaders in the Nationalist Party, particularly Chiang Kai-shek, and with Communist leader Zhou Enlai, both of whom who spoke the same Zhejiang dialect as Stuart. He had taught and protected underground Communist Party members at Yenching University for years, some of whom had become party leaders.John Pomfret, The Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom. The efforts of Marshall and Stuart to mediate between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party are commemorated in the Zhou Enlai/Deng Yingchao Memorial Hall in Nanjing. After Marshall's departure from China in January 1947, Stuart led the mediation efforts that changed from all-out support of the Nationalist government to mediating the coalition government, to negotiating an understanding with the Communist party. When the Nationalist government fled Nanjing, and Communist forces entered the city in April 1949, Stuart maintained the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing. He sought accommodation with the Communist Party in an effort to maintain U.S. presence and influence in China, making contact through a graduate of Yenching University, Huang Hua, who became a member of the Nanjing Military Council. In recommending constructive engagement as an alternative to the official U.S. policy toward China, \\"Stuart came to advocate the kind of asymmetrical Cold War response to communism that George F. Kennan envisioned and that Professor John Gaddis described in his 1980 Bernath Prize Lecture to the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations.\\"The Forgotten Ambassador: The Reports of John Leighton Stuart, 1946-1949, Kenneth W. Rea and John C. Brewer, eds., (Boulder: Westview Press, 1981). At the time, however, Washington was unwilling to open a dialogue with Communist China. In reaction to the State Department White Paper on China, Mao Zedong published a sarcastic essay Farewell, Leighton Stuart!,(Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Beijing, Foreign Languages Press 1969; vol. IV, p. 439) which is still taught in Chinese schools as one of the founding documents of the revolution. Mao wrote: > John Leighton Stuart, who was born in China in 1876, was always a loyal > agent of U.S. cultural aggression in China. He started missionary work in > China in 1905 and in 1919 president of Yenching University, which was > established by the United States in Peking.

Stuart was recalled to the U.S. on August 2, 1949, and formally resigned as Ambassador on November 28, 1952. He was the last person to hold that position before resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries three decades later. After suffering a stroke that incapacitated him for the remainder of his life, Stuart died in Washington, D.C. in 1962. His obituary in The New York Times reported, \\"During his years as a missionary and educator, Dr. Stuart -- gentle mannered and humane -- was one of the most respected Americans in China.\\"\\"J. Leighton Stuart, Dead at 86,\\" New York Times, Sept. 20, 1962. Stuart's memoirs, \\"Fifty Years in China,\\" were only half completed when he was incapacitated by a stroke. The book was finished and published by officials of the U.S. State Department to advance a hard line, anti-Communist political agenda, and the angry, pugnacious tone of the book's latter chapters betray Stuart's self-effacing modesty and patrician voice evident in the first six chapters.  Final Wish and Official Recognition Stuart specified in his will that he be buried in China, in Beijing, at the Yenching University campus, where his wife was buried following her death in 1926.\\"U.S. diplomats' ashes go home to China.\\" International Herald Tribune. November 19, 2008. Accessed November 19, 2008. In November 2008, his ashes were finally taken to China from Washington and buried where his father and mother and a brother were interred, at his birthplace, Hangzhou.John Leighton Stuart, China Expert, Is Buried There at Last, The New York Times, November 19, 2008. On September 4, 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping recognized Stuart during a banquet held to welcome the heads of foreign delegations attending the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, noting to the assembled crowd of diplomats, \\"A hundred and forty years ago, in June 1876, John Leighton Stuart, the former US ambassador to China, was born here in Hangzhou. He went on to live in China for over 50 years and was buried in Hangzhou.\\" Chinese historians said it was the first time since Mao Zedong's famous essay that a top Chinese official had recognized Stuart in public, a signal of the rehabilitation of Stuart's official reputation in modern China.China-born US diplomat recognized decades after Chairman Mao, Global Times, September 9, 2018. Fifty years after Stuart left China, Hangzhou officials restored the Stuart house in Hangzhou as a memorial to the family's contributions to China. The design of the house, a New Orleans style double gallery with garconniere in the rear, was inspired by Aline Rodd Stuart's childhood home on Chestnut Street in the Garden District of New Orleans.

In it had a population of .. History Tel Mond was founded in 1929 by Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett. Lord Melchett was a British industrialist, a former cabinet minister and president of the British Zionist Foundation. The Israel Plantations Company, headed by Mond, purchased land in the region and planted citrus orchards to provide employment for Jewish laborers. In 1933, a group of farmers purchased land from the company and established moshav Tel Mond. In 1936, another group established moshav Kfar Ziv, named after Baron Sieff who followed Lord Melchett and settled in Tel Mond with his wife. In 1943, new immigrants from Yemen established Shechunat Ya'akov. In the 1950s, Neve Oved and Hadar Hayim were built to accommodate the large wave of immigration (mainly from Yemen) after the founding of the state. In 1954, all these communities were merged to form the Local Council of Tel Mond. The surrounding moshavim, Kfar Hess, Herut and Ein Vered, were also founded by the pioneers of Tel Mond.A day in the country - Haaretz - Israel News Over the past decade, the community has grown from a small town to a self-sufficient mini-city that provides services for other regional communities.

Background  It is not known when Li Yuanhong was born. His family was originally from what would become Hua Prefecture (滑州, roughly modern Anyang, Henan), but by Li Yuanhong's time had moved to the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an. The family claimed to be descended from the Han Dynasty general Li Ling, who had surrendered to Xiongnu after being surrounded. According to their claims, an ancestor of theirs and descendant of Li Ling eventually became a subject of Northern Wei and, as he met the Northern Wei emperor at Bing Hall (), was given the family name of Bing. Li Yuanhong's great-great-grandfather Bing Ming () served as a commandant during Sui Dynasty and was created the Duke of Longju. Li Yuanhong's great-grandfather Bing Can () later became a subject of Tang Dynasty, as he was an acquaintance of Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu; Emperor Gaozu created him the Duke of Ying. In order to observe naming taboo for Emperor Gaozu's father Li Bing (), Emperor Gaozu had the Bing family's name changed to Li.New Book of Tang, vol. 72. Li Yuanhong's grandfather Li Kuan () served as the minister of worship during the reign of Emperor Gaozu's grandson Emperor Gaozong, and carried the title of Duke of Longxi. Li Yuanhong's father Li Daoguang served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Gaozong's wife Wu Zetian. Li Yuanhong was said to be careful and kind in his youth. He started his civil service career as a military office at Jing Prefecture (涇州, roughly modern Pingliang, Gansu), and later was promoted to be the census officer at the capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (雍州, roughly modern Xi'an, Shaanxi) during the second reign of Wu Zetian's son Emperor Zhongzong. At that time, Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping was one of the powerful women at court, and on one occasion, she was litigating with a Buddhist temple as to the ownership of a mill, Li Yuahong ruled for the temple. Li Yuanhong's superior, the secretary general of Yong Prefecture Dou Huaizhen, was shocked and tried to get Li to change his ruling; Li responded by writing, in large characters, under his ruling, \\"The Southern Mountains [(i.e., the Qinling Mountains)] may move before this ruling may be changed.\\" Dou could not do anything about it.New Book of Tang, vol. 126 . Li later served as the magistrate of Haozhi County (好畤, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) and then the military advisor to the prefect of Run Prefecture (潤州, roughly modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), and was said to have good reputation wherever he served.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  Early in the Kaiyuan era (713-741) of Emperor Zhongzong's nephew Emperor Xuanzong, Li Yuanhong became the magistrate of Wannian County (), one of the two counties making up the capital Chang'an. It was said that he was fair in imposing taxes and that he was able to get the county well-governed without being overly strict. He was later promoted to the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (京兆府, i.e., Chang'an). It was said at the time that powerful clans often constructed private mills on the rivers in Chang'an, and this negatively impacted the irrigation. Li ordered that these private mills be destroyed, at great benefit to the people. He later successively served as the deputy minister of public works (工部侍郎, Gongbu Shilang), defense (兵部侍郎, Bingbu Shilang), and civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, Libu Shilang). In 725, the deputy ministers of census (戶部侍郎, Hubu Shilang) Yang Chang () and Bai Zhishen () were both charged with making poor budgetary decisions and demoted to be prefectural prefects. Emperor Xuanzong asked the chancellors and other officials to recommend someone who could be qualified to lead the ministry of census, and many recommended Li. Emperor Xuanzong was set to make him the minister of census (戶部尚書, Hubu Shangshu), but the high level officials at the time thought that he was still too inexperienced, and therefore he was only made deputy minister of census, and was given the honorific title Zhong Daifu (). He submitted a number of policy suggestions that pleased Emperor Xuanzong, and Emperor Xuanzong awarded him with a robe and silk. In 726, in the aftermaths of the chancellor Zhang Shuo being removed on accusations of corruption, Li was made Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng) and given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto. He was also given the honorific title Yinqing Guanglu Daifu () and created the Baron of Qingshui. It was said that Li was honest and frugal, and after he became chancellor, he, with some success, tried to curb the tendency for officials to seek promotions by bribes or ingratiations. There was a proposal at the time to end the system of using certain public fields' produce as salary for the officials and instead using the fields to produce for the treasury; Li pointed out that doing so would be merely causing an additional layer of waste, as ultimately the officials' salaries would have to come from the treasury, and the proposal was not carried out. Meanwhile, the official Wu Jing () had been in charge of editing the imperial history, but before his work was complete, he took a leave because of his mother's death. After Wu's period of mourning was complete, he requested to continue the work and was permitted to do so at the Jixian Institute (). After Zhang retired in 727, Emperor Xuanzong also had him work on editing the imperial history at home. Li believed that having Wu and Zhang work separately in separate locations, rather than at the History Pavilion (史館, Shiguan) that Emperor Xuanzong's great-grandfather Emperor Taizong had established, made it easy for imperial archives to be lost, and at his suggestion, Wu and Zhang were asked to work together at the History Pavilion. It was said that while Li served as chancellor, he did not get a larger mansion, did not get more impressive horses, and gave the imperial awards to his relatives, drawing praise from the senior official Song Jing. However, he often had disagreements with fellow chancellor Du Xian, and the senior chancellor Yuan Qianyao was unable to moderate their differences, drawing Emperor Xuanzong's displeasure with all three. In 729, he removed all three from chancellor positions, replacing them with Yuwen Rong and Pei Guangting, while retaining fellow chancellor Xiao Song. Li was demoted to be the prefect of Cao Prefecture (曹州, roughly modern Heze, Shandong). He later left civil service altogether on account of illness, but later was given the honorary office of minister of census and allowed to retire with that title. In 733, when he was seriously ill, he was made the head of the household for Emperor Xuanzong's crown prince Li Hong. He died soon thereafter and was given posthumous honors.

It is a process similar to \\"passing\\" in sociological terms. This term was made popular by Indian sociologist M. N. Srinivas in the 1950s. In a broader sense, also called Brahmanization, it is a historical process in which local Indian religious traditions become aligned to and absorbed within the Brahmanical tradition, creating the pan-Indian tradition of Hinduism. Definition Srinivas defined Sanskritisation as a process by which In a broader sense, Sanskritization is In this process, local traditions (\\"little traditions\\") become integrated into the \\"great tradition\\" of Brahmanical religion, disseminating Sanskrit texts and Brahmanical ideas throughout India, and abroad. This facilitated the development of the Hindu synthesis, in which the Brahmanical tradition absorbed \\"local popular traditions of ritual and ideology.\\" According to Srinivas, Sanskritisation is not just the adoption of new customs and habits, but also includes exposure to new ideas and values appearing in Sanskrit literature. He says the words Karma, dharma, paap, maya, samsara, and moksha are the most common Sanskrit theological ideas which become common in the talk of people who are sanskritised. Development Srinivas first propounded this theory in his D.Phil. thesis at Oxford. The thesis was later brought out as a book, which was an ethnographical study of the Kodava (Coorgs) community of Karnataka. Srinivas writes: The book challenged the then prevalent idea that caste was a rigid and unchanging institution. The concept of sanskritisation addressed the actual complexity and fluidity of caste relations. It brought into academic focus the dynamics of the renegotiation of status by various castes and communities in India. According to a similar heuristic was previously described by Ambedkar (1916, 1917) Jaffrelot goes on to say, \\"While the term was coined by Srinivas, the process itself had been described by colonial administrators such as E. T. Atkinson in his Himalayan Gazetteer and Alfred Lyall, in whose works Ambedkar might well have encountered it.\\" Examples Sanskritization is often aimed to claim the Varna status of Brahmin or Kshatriyas, the two prestigious Varna of the Vedic-age Varna system. One such example in North India is of Rajput. According to historical evidence, the present day Rajput community varies greatly in status, comprising those with royal lineage to those whose ancestors were petty tenants or tribals who gained land and political power to justify their claim of being Kshatriya. The word Kshatriya is hence not synonymous with Rajput. One clear example of sanskritisation is the adoption, in emulation of the practice of twice-born castes, of vegetarianism by people belonging to the so- called \\"low castes\\" who are traditionally not averse to non-vegetarian food. An unsuccessful example is the Vishwakarma caste's claim to Brahmin status, which is not generally accepted outside that community, despite their adoption of some Brahmin caste traits, such as wearing the sacred thread, and the Brahminisation of their rituals. Srinivas juxtaposed the success of the Lingayat caste in achieving advancement within Karnataka society by such means with the failure of the Vishwakarma to achieve the same. Their position as a left-hand caste has not aided their ambition. Reception This phenomenon has also been observed in Nepal among Khas, Magar, Newar, and Tharu people.

While Native American performers in a variety of genres are also recognized, nominees do have to be Native American or at least one member in a group or band from a State for Federally recognized tribe. How to submit your music The awards were created in 1998 to offer Native American musicians greater recognition from the American music industry and to create opportunities for international exposure and recognition. Founded by music industry executive, Ellen Bello, the Annual Native American Music Awards is the largest membership-based organization for Native American music initiatives and consists of over 20,000 registered voting members and professionals in the field. They also hold the largest Native American music library in the world with a national archive featuring a collection of over 10,000 audio and video recordings in all formats housed since 1990.Native American Music Awards History Awards show The awards show honors national recordings released in the previous calendar year that encompass traditional and contemporary Native American music instrumentation and/or lyrics. Traditional music through history has been an integral part of Native American life and tribal identity, for example: pow wow music, round dance songs, and Native American flute music. Contemporary Native American music has grown to encompass many popular genres (for example: rock, pop, blues, hip hop, and country), as well as uniquely distinctive genres including Waila (or Chicken scratch) and Native American Church music. There is also a \\"Native Heart category\\", an award given specifically to non-native artists in the field. Nominees are submitted and selected by a national advisory membership, consisting of professionals who pay an annual membership to join the organization. Winners are selected by a combined vote by the national membership and the general public, who can listen to and vote on nominees' songs featured on the Native American Music Awards website.Native American Music Awards Nominations and Voting Process The awards ceremony features live artist performances and 30 awards categories in various traditional and contemporary music genres, as well as Lifetime Achievement Awards and Hall of Fame inductions. The program often reaches beyond talent from Indian reservations and embraces internationally renowned artists such as; Robbie Robertson, Rita Coolidge, John Densmore, Nelly Furtado, Rickey Medlocke, Felipe Rose, and others.

Awards The dedicated Native American Music Awards successfully proposed the Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album in 2000. The Native American Music Awards or N.A.M.A. was the first national awards program for Native American music in North America. The Awards was born out of a need for greater recognition for Native American music initiatives and remains the largest professional membership based organization in the world. From 2001 to 2011, the American Grammy Awards presented an annual award for Best Native American Music Album, and the Canadian Juno Awards present an annual award for Aboriginal Recording of the Year. On April 6, 2011, it was announced that the Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album would be merged into a new category, Best Regional Roots Music Album.

A diagram of the phenomenon known as Alexander's band, a dark band that appears between any set of two rainbows which is the result of differing angles of reflection of light through water droplets. Alexander's band or Alexander's dark band is an optical phenomenon associated with rainbows which was named after Alexander of Aphrodisias who first described it in 200 AD.Alexander of Aphrodisias, Commentary on Book IV of Aristotle's Meteorology (also known as: Commentary on Book IV of Aristotle's De Meteorologica or On Aristotle's Meteorology 4), commentary 41.Raymond L. Lee and Alistair B. Fraser, The Rainbow Bridge: Rainbows in Art, Myth, and Science (University Park, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2001)pages 110 - 111. It occurs due to the deviation angles of the primary and secondary rainbows. Both bows exist due to an optical effect called the angle of minimum deviation. The refractive index of water prevents light from being deviated at smaller angles. The minimum deviation angle for the primary bow is 137.5°. Light can be deviated up to 180°, causing it to be reflected right back to the observer. Light which is deviated at intermediate angles brightens the inside of the rainbow. The minimum deviation angle for the secondary bow is about 230°. The fact that this angle is greater than 180° makes the secondary bow an inside-out version of the primary. Its colors are reversed, and light which is deviated at greater angles brightens the sky outside the bow. Between the two bows lies an area of unlit sky referred to as Alexander's band. Light which is reflected by raindrops in this region of the sky cannot reach the observer, though it may contribute to a rainbow seen by another observer elsewhere.

NCBA Collegiate Department offers degree programs in the Arts, Sciences, Business and Education as well as Diploma programs. NCBA also offers Graduate degrees in Master in Business Administration and Master in Public Administration. History 2017 stamp of the Philippines dedicated to the 50th anniversary of NCBA Established in 1967–68, at the corner of R. Papa and Lepanto streets in Sampaloc, Manila between two giants in Philippine private education: University of the East with its mammoth population of 65,000 and Far Eastern University with its enrollment of 47,000. A small building was erected to house a small school — the National College of Business and Arts. Today the NCBA has three campuses, two in Quezon City and one in Rizal. NCBA was founded by the late Dr. Doroteo S. Pasion, a well-known educator (former dean of commerce of San Beda College, former CPA review director of the University of the East, and former president of PSBA), lawyer, accountant, author, and civic leader. Pasion launched NCBA as a public service, with others who believed in the NCBA concept: Col.Rafael Q. Yap-Diangco, Atty. Jose R. Torres, Jr., Mrs. Gloria C. Meñez, and Mrs. Lourdes L. Sarabia Keeping to its founder's vision, NCBA opted to remain as a specialized school and a gives a quality education its growth was measured and steady through the years. From that small edifice along R. Papa Street, NCBA slowly expanded its academic programs and facilities with the single purpose of the nation type of educated manpower it needs for its development and well-being. When NCBA opened in 1968, its offerings were limited to the following courses: Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Bachelor of Arts, two-year course in Secretarial Administration, and its own CPA review. The NCBA High School was opened in school year 1973–1974 followed by additional offerings of short terminal courses in Cooperative, Salesmanship, Bookkeeping and Accounting, and Small business Management in 1974–1975. 2010s Effective January 2010, Assistant Vice President for finance and Director, Mr. Cesar C. Meñez, became the school President while, Mr. Edwin P. Torres, and officer-in-charge at NCBA Taytay, became the Vice-President for finance. NCBA Taytay employed Ester Pasion-David as the new officer-in-charge. Pasion-David is the eldest daughter of the founder and first president of the NCBA. She has a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, major in Accounting, from the University of the Philippines-Diliman. Soon after Pasion-David did the CPA Licensure Examination. She started her career at the Philippine National Bank then migrated to United States and worked as a staff accountant at Avon Products in New York City then went to California and worked as an Accounting and HR manager for Alcatel. Her last job was with TRI-FAB Associates as a Controller. Pasion-David also co-authored different accounting books. Last 2016, Atty. Concepcion Nancy T. Pasion, became the next president of this educational institution. Cesar C. Meñez also died on the same year. Golden anniversary In February 2017, NCBA celebrated their 50th founding anniversary, with a new slogan, Vision and Mission.

The Velyaminovs served as hereditary mayors of Moscow until the office was abolished by Dmitry Donskoy (Prince of Moscow from 1359 to 1389), whose own mother came from this family. History The Vorontsov branch of the Velyaminovs reached a zenith of its power in the person of the boyar Feodor Vorontsov, who became de facto ruler of Russia during the minority of Ivan IV (\\"Ivan the Terrible\\", 1543). Three years later, he was accused of treason and beheaded. For the next two centuries, the family history is obscure. Under Empress Elizabeth (reigned 1741-1762), its fortunes soared once again, when Mikhail Illarionovich Vorontsov became Vice-Chancellor of the Russian Empire. The Vorontsov Palace in Saint Petersburg, designed by Rastrelli, remains a monument to his power. During the reign of Peter III of Russia (January to July, 1762), Mikhail Vorontsov was the most powerful man in Russia, as his niece Elizaveta Vorontsova became the Emperor's mistress. Peter's wife Catherine, alarmed by her husband's plans to divorce her and marry Elizaveta Vorontsova, deposed her husband, with great help from her bosom friend, Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova, the wife of Prince Dashkov and Elizaveta's own sister. Yekaterina Dashkova's brothers, Alexander and Semyon Romanovich, both became notable diplomats. The latter's son, Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov (1782-1856), became a prominent general who fostered the colonisation of New Russia and led the Russian army in the Caucasus. The Vorontsovs from this branch were inveterate Anglophiles and supported many English servants, painters, and architects. Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova bequeathed her vast possessions and the Vorontsov-Dashkov surname to her cousin, who formed a junior branch of the Vorontsov family with the distinct Vorontsov-Dashkov surname. Its most notable representative, Count Illarion Ivanovich Vorontsov-Dashkov (1837–1916), served as Minister of Imperial Properties (1881–1897) and as the General Governor of the Caucasus in 1905–1915. He was officially in charge of the victorious Russian forces in the Battle of Sarikamish (December 1914 to January 1915) during the early months of World War I.

He was the Deputy Reich Health Leader (Reichsgesundheitsführer) and Plenipotentiary for Cancer Research in the Reich Research Council. In his autobiography Arzt im Kampf (A Physician's Struggle), he equated medical and military power in their battle for life and death. Blome was tried at the Doctors' Trial in 1947 on charges of practicing euthanasia and conducting experiments on humans. He only admitted that he had been ordered in 1943 to experiment with plague vaccines on concentration camp prisoners. In reality, starting in 1943 he \\"assumed responsibility for all research into biological warfare sponsored by the Wehrmacht\\" and the S.S.Paul Maddrell, 'Operation “Matchbox” and the Scientific Containment of the USSR', in Peter Jackson & Jennifer Siegel (eds.)Intelligence and Statecraft: The Use and Limits of Intelligence in International Society. Praeger Publishers, 2005, p. 191. Although he was acquitted of war crimes charges at the Nuremberg Doctors' Trial, this was mainly due to the intervention of the United States as his earlier admissions were well known. It was generally accepted that he had indeed participated in chemical and biological warfare experiments on concentration camp inmates.Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair, Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Nazis. Verso, 1998, p. 148. Director of the Nazi biological warfare program As Plenipotentiary for Cancer Research in the Third Reich, Blome had a longstanding interest in the \\"military use of carcinogenic substances\\" and cancer-causing viruses. According to Ute Deichmann's book Biologists under Hitler, in 1942 he became director of a unit affiliated with the Central Cancer Institute at the University of Posen (Poznań in Poland, annexed by Germany in 1939). Although he claimed that the work at this institute involved only 'defensive' measures against biological weapons, Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Goering, and Erich Schumann, head of the Wehrmacht's Science Section, strongly supported the offensive use of chemical and biological weapons against Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States. In 1943, Schumann wrote to Dr. Heinrich Kliewe, one of the Wehrmacht's biological warfare experts that \\"in particular, America must be attacked simultaneously with various human and animal epidemic pathogens as well as plant pests.\\"Ute Deichmann, Biologists under Hitler. Harvard University Press, 1996, p. 280. According to Kliewe, plague, typhoid, cholera and anthrax were being developed as weapons, as well as a new \\"synthetic medium for the spread of these bacteria\\" which would allow them to remain virulent for eight to twelve weeks.Deichmann, p. 280. As part of the Nazi biological warfare program code- named Blitzableiter (Lightning Rod), Blome's institute was therefore \\"a camouflaged operation for the production of biological warfare agents\\", and its construction was overseen by Karl I. Gross, an S.S. officer and specialist in tropical diseases, who had conducted lethal experiments on 1,700 prisoners at the Mauthausen concentration camp.Robert N. Proctor, The Nazi War on Cancer. Princeton University Press, 1999, pp. 262-63. It was surrounded by a ten-foot high wall, guarded by a special S.S. unit, and designed to prevent the accidental release of the various biological agents being produced there. By May 1944, the institute had sections devoted to physiology-biology, bacteriology and vaccines, radiology, pharmacology, cancer statistics and a tumor farm, and had received at least 2.7 million Reichsmarks in funding from the Wehrmacht and S.S. in 1943–45.Deichmann, p. 283. Blome worked on methods of storage and dispersal of biological agents like plague, cholera, anthrax, and typhoid, and also infected prisoners with plague in order to test the efficacy of vaccines. At the University of Strassburg, a \\"special unit\\" headed by Prof. Eugen von Haagan and employing researchers like Kurt Gutzeit and Arnold Dohmen, tested typhus, hepatitis, nephritis, and other chemical and biological weapons on concentration camp inmates.Naomi Baumslag, Murderous Medicine: Nazi Doctors, Human Experimentation, and Typhus. Praeger Publishers, 2005, p. 208. Gutzeit was in charge of hepatitis research for the German Army, and he and his colleagues carried out virus experiments on mental patients, Jews, Russian POWs and Gypsies in Sachsenhausen, Auschwitz and other locations.Office of U.S. Chief of Counsel for the American Military Tribunals at Nurember, 1946. http://www.mazal.org/NO-series/NO-0124-000.htm;B. Leyendecker and F. Klapp, \\"Human Hepatitis Experiments in the Second World War\\". U.S. Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, 1989. In October 1944, Himmler also ordered Blome to experiment with plague on concentration camp prisoners.Deichmann, p. 284. Use of insect vectors in biological warfare In 1943, Blome proposed spreading malaria \\"artificially by means of mosquitoes\\" and experimented on prisoners at Dachau and Buchenwald with lice in order to cause typhus epidemics.Jeffrey Alan Lockwood, Six-Legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 128. Eduard May, director of the Entomological Division of the SS Institute for Practical Research in Military Science, received a commission to experiment on concentration camp prisoners with \\"humanly harmful insects\\" starting in October 1943, which was closely connected with Blome's biological warfare program.Eckart Menzler-Trott, Logic's Lost Genius: The Life of Gerhard Gentzen. American Mathematical Society, 2007, p. 200. May collaborated with him in experiments on \\"the artificial mass transmission of the malaria parasite to humans\\", with infected mosquitoes dropped from planes. In addition, the Wehrmacht's Veterinary Section, which included research projects on animal diseases being conducted by Erich Traub at the Insel Riems (Riems Island) Institute, was developing methods to spread these by aircraft over Britain, the U.S. and the Soviet Union.Deichmann, p. 281. Like Kurt Blome's cancer research institute in Posen, the State Research Institute at Insel Riems was a dual use facility during the Second World War where at least some biological warfare experiments were conducted. It was founded in 1909–10 to study foot-and-mouth disease and by World War II employed about 20 scientists and a staff of about 70–120. From 1919 to 1948, its director was Otto Waldmann. Hans-Christoph Nagel, a veterinarian and biological warfare expert for the German Army, was in charge of research into the use of animal and insect diseases as biological weapons. Like Blome, Traub was also employed by the U.S. government after the war as a biological warfare expert.Erhard Geissler, \\"Conversion of BTW Warfare facilities: Lessons from German History\\" in Geissler et al (eds) Conversion of Former BTW Facilities. Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1998, pp. 53-66. Insecticides and experiments with nerve gas Blome also worked on aerosol dispersants and methods of spraying nerve agents like Tabun and Sarin from aircraft, and tested the effects of these gases on prisoners at Auschwitz. I.G. Farben had developed nerve gas in 1936 as a result of its research into insecticides, and Blome's duties included preparing defensive measures against possible Allied use of insect-borne biological weapons, either in a first strike or in retaliation for German use of such weapons. As early as September 1940, Wolfram Sievers, director of the S.S. Ahnenerbe Institute, had warned Blome of the need to expand the production of insecticides to deal with this eventuality.Deichmann, p. 286. This led Blome to experiment with the dispersal of insecticides, fungicides and nerve gas from aircraft, especially after Hitler had ordered a \\"drastic increase\\" in the production of Tabun and Sarin at I.G. Farben's Dyhernfurth factory in eastern Germany. On orders from Himmler in 1944, Blome also tested these on inmates at Auschwitz.Deichmann, p. 287. Flight from the Poznan Institute Blome fled from Posen in January 1945 just ahead of the Red Army, and was unable to have the facilities completely destroyed. He informed Walter Schreiber, head of the Wehrmacht's Military Medical Inspectorate, that he was \\"very concerned that the installations for human experiments that were in the institute and recognizable as such, would be very easily identified by the Russians.\\" He relocated to the town of Geraburg in Thuringia, where the Wehrmacht and SS had already constructed another biological warfare facility disguised as a cancer research institute. Blome brought his biological cultures with him from Poland, and was still promising Hitler a Wunderwaffe or 'miracle weapon' that would turn the tide of war in Germany's favor, but the Geraburg facility was captured by the U.S. Army in April 1945, along with its records and equipment.Proctor, p. 262. Collaboration with Unit 731 and the Japanese biological warfare program Throughout the war, the German and Japanese biological warfare programs exchanged information, samples, and equipment by submarine. The last of these submarines departed from Japan as late as May 1945. The Japanese destroyed many of the records about these contacts and the biological warfare program prior to their own surrender in August 1945. In the 1930s, Hitler had ordered a group of officers led by Otto Muntsch to study Japan's use of chemical and biological weapons against China. These programs of scientific cooperation and exchange were formalized in a series of agreements in 1938–39. Hojo Enryo, a Japanese Army doctor and expert in biological weapons \\"frequently visited the Robert Koch Institute as well as companies under German occupation to collect information about research on bacteriological warfare\\" and gave a lecture on this subject at the Berlin Military Academy of Medicine in October 1941.\\"Japanese-German Collaboration in the Development of Bacteriological and Chemical Weapons and the War in China\\" in Christian W. Spang and Rolf-Harold Wippich (eds) Japanese-German Relations, 1895–1945: War, Diplomacy and Public Opinion. Routledge, 2006, p. 207. Gerhard Rose, who was \\"the German expert on tropical diseases and epidemic typhus\\" and later a defendant at the Nuremberg Doctors Trial, supplied samples of the yellow fever virus to Unit 731 that they had been unable to obtain from the United States.Martin, p. 207. Blome's own institute in Posen was very similar in design to Unit 731's facility in Pingfan, Manchuria.Martin, p. 208. Postwar activities and employment by the United States Blome was arrested in Munich on 17 May 1945 by the United States Counter Intelligence Corps (an army intelligence service). He had no papers except his driving licence. After some weeks of custody, during which the CIC checked on his identity, Blome was taken to Kransberg Castle (a medieval castle north of Frankfurt). After his arrival at the castle a secret message was transmitted to Operation Alsos, an Anglo-American team of experts, tasked with investigating the state of German and Italian weapons technology towards the end the of war: > In 1943 Blome was studying bacteriological warfare, although officially he > was involved in cancer research, which was however only a camouflage. Blome > additionally served as deputy health minister of the Reich. Would like you > to send investigators?\\"Alsos interrogation: in the Kurt Blome INSCOM dossier > XE001248. Arrest reports: in Blome's Nuremberg arrest file, RG 238, NARS. It is believed that American intervention saved Blome from the gallows in exchange for information about biological warfare, nerve gas, and providing advice on to the American chemical and biological weapons programs Erhard Geissler, \\"Die Rolle deutscher Biowaffenexperten in der Zeit nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg,\\" in Oehler-Klein & Roelcke,Vergangenheitspolitik in der universitaeren Medizin nach 1945 (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 2007), p. 101. In November 1947, two months after his Nuremberg acquittal, Blome was interviewed by four representatives from Camp Detrick, Maryland, including H.W. Batchelor, in which he \\"identified biological warfare experts and their location and described different methods of conducting biological warfare.\\" In 1951, he was hired by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps under Project 63, one of the successors to Operation Paperclip, to work on chemical warfare. His file neglected to mention Nuremberg. Denied a visa by the U.S. Consul in Frankfurt, he was employed at European Command Intelligence Center at Oberursel, West Germany. He worked there on a never-declassified top secret project labeled in Blome's foreign scientist case file as \\"Army, 1952, Project 1975\\".Annie Jacobsen: \\"Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program that Brought Nazi Scientists to America\\" Little, Brown and Company, Inc. (2014) p. 364 (see also: \\"What Cold War CIA Interrogators Learned from the Nazis\\" The Daily Beast, 2. November 2014, (accessed Jan. 6, 2017) ) He was not arrested or charged with war crimes again after his acquittal at the Nuremberg Doctors' Trial in 1947. He also continued to practice medicine in West Germany, and was active in politics as a member of the right-wing Germany Party.

His family immigrated to Israel in 1949 and settled in Tel Aviv, where he has lived ever since. He studied world literature and clinical psychology at Bar Ilan University. He is currently an independent psychotherapist using psychoanalytical methods. Geldman has published 18 poetry books, a book of short stories and 6 non-fiction books. A two volume collection from his poetry books was published in 2011. His last poetry book is the third volume of the collection of his poetry written till 2019 . His poems were translated into many languages: Chinese and Japanese included. His book \\"Becoming One\\" was translated to Portuguese (\\"Teoria Do Um\\") and published in Portugal on 2017. A large collection of his poems in English was published on 2018 in Suny Press, State University of N.Y. Geldman's poetry is philosophical, psychological, and existentialistic. It combines literary Hebrew and everyday language, even using some slang. His later poetry tends to be meditative and includes many haiku. He was influenced by Zen Buddhist esthetics and philosophy. His poetry sings with many voices – lyrical, philosophical,sensual, erotic, religious, ironic and others. A sober mind integrates all these aspects of his personality. His non-fiction books deal with subjects as the self in psychoanalytic theories and in Yoga and Buddhism, psychoanalytic interpretation of literature, doubles and symmetries in Shakespeare's plays, his favorite Israeli poets and artists, etc. As a visual artist, Geldman is engaged in plastic arts, ceramics and photography. His photographs were exhibited at such places as the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. Geldman was an art critic of the Israeli daily Haaretz, and treasured exhibitions for many Israeli artists.

Biography Álvaro's father was an unknown Kongo nobleman who died, leaving his mother to remarry to King Henrique I. When Henrique I died fighting on the eastern frontier, he had left Álvaro as his regent. According to Duarte Lopes, Kongo's ambassador to Rome in 1584-88, Álvaro had taken up the kingship by common consent. However, there do appear to have been others who wished to be king, and some scholars, notably Francois Bontinck, think that Álvaro's rule was seen as an usurpation. The invasion of the Jagas, which took place shortly after Álvaro became king, is sometimes seen as a protest against this usurpation. Other scholars, however doubt the connection between the Jaga invasion and a dynastic crisis. The Jagas, however, did create a major problem for Álvaro, who had to abandon the capital of Mbanza Kongo, and flee to an island in the Congo River. From that place he sought help from Portugal to restore him to the throne and expel the Jagas. Portugal responded by sending an expedition of 600 soldiers, mostly from the colony of São Tome, under the command of Francisco de Gouveia Sottomaior. Gouveia Sottomaior's instructions included obtaining some sort of vassalage from Álvaro and regaining control of the Portuguese community in Kongo by building a fort to \\"protect\\" them. However that might be, strong opposition by Portuguese in Kongo, led by Álvaro's confessor, Francisco Barbuda, prevented most of Gouveia Sottomaior's instructions from being carried out. However, Álvaro apparently did permit the Portuguese to settle in Luanda and the colony of Angola was born when Paulo Dias de Novais arrived with his force in 1575. Álvaro sought to relieve the potential threat to his sovereignty by assisting Dias de Novais, sending troops to help him in 1577. However, he, or at the very least Francisco Barbuda, was instrumental in persuading the king of Ndongo, where Dias de Novais had his principal forces, to drive the Portuguese out. Once this had happened, however, Álvaro sent an army to Angola to assist the Portuguese and to conquer Ndongo. The conquest failed, however, as the Kongo army was overextended and could not cross the Bengo River successfully. Álvaro sought to Europeanize Kongo more fully than had been the case before. He was the first king to refer to the capital city as São Salvador. He also sought to obtain a bishop from Rome, though it was not until the reign of his son Álvaro II of Kongo that this was accomplished. In 1587, he was succeeded by his son Álvaro II.

The committee was announced by the then Minister for Sport Rod Kemp and the Australian Parliament after extensive media publicity surrounding alleged mismanagement and corruption in the previous governing body, Soccer Australia. The impetus for reform was more acute after the public had witnessed the spectacle of the 2002 FIFA World Cup which contrasted with the near-bankrupt state of the local game. Precursor A series of incidents highlighted the critical state of Soccer in Australia: *a) The failure of the Socceroos to qualify for the FIFA World Cup and FIFA Confederations Cup due to there being inadequate funds to send European based players to friendlies and the OFC Nations Cup. *b) The investigation by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Four Corners programme into conflicts of interest and mismanagement at the Board level at Soccer Australia. *c) The constant in- fighting between political factions and concentration of voting and legislative powers in a relative minority of people perpetuating bad governance. *d) The overt resistance to accept the government enquiry, and even an initial refusal to accept its recommendations despite the balance of government and public opinion seeking rapid implementation. Committee (taken from the published report). * Mr David Crawford (chair)—retired National Chairman of KPMG and current director of several major companies including BHP Billiton, Foster’s Group, Lend Lease, National Foods and Westpac Banking Corporation. * Mr Johnny Warren — former captain of the Socceroos and highly regarded football analyst and commentator. * Mr Bruce Corlett — Chairman of Adsteam Marine Limited and Servcorp Limited, current non-executive director of several companies including Trust Company of Australia Limited and Stockland Trust Group, and past chairman of Australian Maritime Safety Authority. * Ms Kate Costello — lawyer and former academic, chairman of Bassett Consulting Engineers, chairman of SAAB ITS and director of SAAB Systems, member of the Australian Institute of Company Directors’ Education Committee and management consultant specialising in corporate governance. * Mr Mark Peters — Chief Executive Officer, Australian Sports Commission and experienced national and international sports administrator. He has considerable experience in reviewing the structures and management of sports and national leagues. * Secretariat services provided by Mr Stephen Fox and Mrs Jay Davenport. Objectives The stated objectives of the review were published as follows: # a critical assessment of the existing governance, management and structure of soccer in Australia; # solution-based recommendations to deliver a comprehensive governance framework and management structure for the sport that addresses the needs of affiliate organisations and stakeholders. These recommendations may include adjustments to existing governance systems and/or integration of activities and operations; # identification of potential impediments to reform and strategies to overcome those impediments; and # a plan to implement the recommendations. Outcomes Despite initial attempts to scuttle the reform process, the majority of reforms and recommendations have been implemented by the National and State Football Associations. In particular, resistance to reforms at the National level were largely destroyed by the threat of the Australian Sports Commission to withhold funding to Soccer Australia. Restructuring of the governance of the Associations has led to a more democratic approach and the enfranchisement of groups not previously represented (e.g. referees, women's players, etc.). In more substantial terms, it led to the resignation of the Soccer Australia board en masse.http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s736919.htm The replacement body, the Football Federation of Australia was established with a board led by Frank Lowy.http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2003/s954773.htm The decision to establish a new governing body was made after the then Australian Soccer Association, now Football Federation Australia chairman Frank Lowy stated that the state of the existing governing body was not repairable and that there was no reasonable prospects of Soccer Australia ever being in a state to be reconstituted.http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2003/s954773.htm The Frank Lowy led board completely replaced the organisation with a new one called Football Federation Australia It has achieved financial stability. It has acquired high profile sponsors including Foxtel and Hyundai. The relaunched domestic competition (the Hyundai A-League) can be seen as a by- product of the recommendations of the Independent Soccer Review Committee's report to change the form and organisation of domestic competition within Australia.https://secure.ausport.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/153818/Crawford_Report_2003.pdf See also *Australian Federal Government *Soccer in Australia External links * - Football Federation Australia website.

In the Pfaffenbrief they for the first time expressed themselves as a territorial unity, referring to themselves as unser Eydgnosschaft. They assumed in this document authority over clericals (Pfaffen), subjecting them to their worldly legislation. Furthermore, the Pfaffenbrief forbade feuds and the parties pledged to guarantee the peace on the road from Zürich to the St. Gotthard pass. The immediate cause of the contract was an attack of the provost of the cathedral (Grossmünster) of Zürich, Bruno Brun, on Peter von Gundoldingen, mayor of Lucerne, on September 13, 1370. Brun held Gundoldingen imprisoned and refused to recognize the jurisdiction of a secular court, but was banned from Zürich and his prisoner released. The Pfaffenbrief was drawn up because the Confederacy was concerned that Brun, who was in Habsburg services, might still appeal to a court of the Holy Roman Empire, or to an ecclesiastical court, and to avoid similar disputes in the future.

The 3rd and the Mortal was one of the early bands that used a lead female singer in the metal scene, in which inspired bands such as The Gathering, Flowing Tears and Nightwish. Musical historyThe 3rd and The Mortal and Storm (1994–1996)= Rueslåtten was born in Trondheim. After taking part of some local bands, she was only 19 when she joined the cult progressive doom metal band The 3rd and the Mortal with whom she recorded the demo The 3rd and the Mortal in 1993, the EP Sorrow in 1993 and the full-length album Tears Laid in Earth in 1994 through the record label Voices of Wonder. The music was strongly atmospheric mixing progressive and metal elements. After she left the band she joined the project Storm and recorded Nordavind before she released her first solo project Demo Recordings, both being Nordic-folk-music styled. =Solo career and retirement (1997–2005)= Spindelsinn, her first official solo album came out in 1997 through Sony Norway, sung entirely in the Norwegian language making honour to the Nordic folk music style. She was nominated for best vocal artist in the Norwegian Grammy Awards as best female artist at the Norwegian Hit-Awards. The following year the second release Mesmerized came out. A mellower album, with more personal lyrics in which she left the folk-acoustic style in favour of exploring more modern sounds. The singing style is reminiscent in some parts of Tori Amos mixed with her own style. Tired of relying on producers to get the sounds she wanted for her songs, she decided to study production and went to London, England, for a couple of years. After joining the Swedish label GMR Music Group Rueslåtten released a comeback album, the experimental Pilot which contains a lot of modern sounds. It bears some resemblance to Björk, but with the more passionate feel which has always characterized Kari's music. In January 2005, Other People's Stories was issued, showing a simpler side of her music but without losing the modern feel, quality and passion in her performance. At the end of 2005, after performing live in support of her last album, she took a break from her artistic career. =Comeback; Time to Tell (2013)= In 2013 Kari Rueslåtten made a comeback with the remake of The 3rd and The Mortal's classic \\"Why So Lonely\\", featuring Tuomas Holopainen from Nightwish on piano and keyboards, and followed up with the full-length album Time to Tell in 2014, on the Swedish label Despotz Records. =To The North (2015)= On 22 October 2015, Kari Rueslåtten released her sixth full-length album To The North, fusing the acoustic work of her older releases with the darker atmospheres inspired by her home country of Norway. Singles released from this were a cover of The Byrds 1965 song \\"Turn, Turn, Turn\\" showcasing it in a darker and more melancholic way and \\"Battle Forevermore\\". = Silence Is the Only Sound (2017) = Released 25 September 2017, Silence Is the Only Sound was Rueslåtten's seventh solo album in English, following up the style and atmospheric sound from To The North. The album spawned the three singles \\"Chasing Rivers\\", \\"Spellbound\\", and \\"The Harbour\\". The second single was an English version of \\"Spindelsinn\\" to commemorate the 20th anniversary of her album, also titled Spindelsinn. = Sørgekåpe (2020) = On 18 February 2020 Rueslåtten announced her ninth full-length album titled Sørgekåpe, her first album in Norwegian since the debut Spindelsinn in 1997. The title track \\"Sørgekåpe\\" was released as the album's first single on March 8th to mark the International Women's Day, and featured a music video by the Norwegian director Troll Toftenes shot in the mountains of Dovrefjell. =Other works= Rueslåtten has also been featured in a handful of drum 'n' bass tracks by the Norwegian duo Rawthang.

His fame, which extends far beyond the Institute of Technology, stems from his relief shading work on school maps and atlases. Between 1922 and 1973 Imhof worked on many school maps. He drew and shaded maps of Switzerland as well her various cantons and the Austrian province of Vorarlberg. Biography Eduard Imhof was born in Schiers, a town in eastern Switzerland. His father, also Eduard Imhof, was a geographer who taught at a local college. In 1902 the family moved to Zurich, were Imhof continued his schooling. In 1914 he began studying surveying at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, continuing until 1919. Whilst a student his studies where sometimes interrupted by military duty guarding the Swiss border as a lieutenant of artillery. During the Second World War he would return to military service in 1939 and serve occasionally until 1945, eventually gaining the rank of major. Upon earning his diploma as a surveyor in 1919 Imhof began working as a faculty member at the Institute of Geodesy at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. In 1922 he married Agnes Untersander and between 1922 and 1935 they had four children together. In 1925 he was appointed the first Swiss Professor of Cartography and founded the Cartographic Institute in Zurich. In 1927 Imhof was tasked with revising the Schweizerischer Mittelschulatlas, the atlas used in Swiss high schools. All editions of the Schweizerischer Mittelschulatlas published from 1932 until 1976 were under his direction. The Swiss primary school atlas, the Schweizerischer Sekundarschulatlas, published between 1934 and 1975, were also produced under his direction. Imhof spent several weeks living in a Tibetan monastery in 1930 while he was measuring the height and position of Minya Konka. On this expedition he was accompanied by Paul Nabholz and Arnold Heim. In 1951 he travelled to Ankara to work on surveying Turkey for the Turkish Office for Land Surveying (Harita Genel Müdürlügü). In 1954 he married Viola May and that same year made an ascent of Mount Ararat. In 1959 he was instrumental in founding the International Cartographic Association, becoming their first president from 1961 to 1964. He retired from teaching academically in 1965, but continued to give lectures and accept many awards for his lifetime of achievement until his death in 1986 in Erlenbach, following a short illness.

Southern Buddhism \\"Southern Buddhism\\" represents Buddhism as practiced in Sri Lanka and countries in mainland Southeast Asia, especially Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. This group is primarily connected by the Pāli Canon, monasticism and its prevalent monastic rules, and ritual practices.Cantwell, Cathy; Kawanami, Hiroko. \\"Buddhism\\". In Woodhead, Linda; Partridge, Christopher; Kawanami, Hiroko. Religions in the Modern World. Routledge. p. 78. . Southern Buddhism tends to be in agreement that the canonical Pali scriptures and commentaries are considered its textual authority, and a strong monastic tradition along with the ideal of renunciation (considered the best way to live one's life) allows its adherents to disregard worldly concerns and devote all of their attention to religious practice. It is usually considered to be synonymous with the Theravada. Theravada means from the elders; teaching come from immediate disciple of Buddha, Ananda and Kassapa. Buddhists in this region place their trust in the Triple Gem: Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha and is of utmost important in order to seek refuge to the Triple Gem for conducting a Buddhist ritual. The sangha includes both nuns and lay supports of the monastic community while referring to the overall body of the spiritually advanced community. However, monks are predominately the symbol of the sangha and the symbol of many individual’s worship. Ranking for the sangha is based on seniority by the time of entry and gender, while many decisions are made ideally by consensus.Cantwell and Kawanami. Religions in the Modern World. Woodhead. p. 79. . Southern Buddhism Monastic Members The monastic members of Southern Buddhism are characterized by celibacy, detachment, and monastic discipline. These monastic members are valued above the lay Buddhist. There are two distinctions of monastic members, those with book duty, where they would be a resident in a monastic institution intending to preserve and teach the traditions that are passed down, whereas those on meditation duty would instead focus on gaining realizations (often through reclusive forest retreats). The monastic community is an important social institution that provides education and social mobility for the bright and ambitious. Northern Buddhism \\"Northern Buddhism\\" sometimes refers to Buddhism as practiced in East Asia and the Tibetan region- particularly China, Tibet, Nepal, Korea, Mongolia, Japan, and Vietnam. It is often held to by synonymous with Mahayana. However, the term Northern Buddhism is also sometimes used to refer specifically to Tibetan (including Mongolian) Buddhism. In this terminology, the Buddhism of China, Japan etc. is called Eastern Buddhism. The Brill Dictionary of Religion uses the term Northern Buddhism in a sense exclusive of tantric Buddhism. In early Buddhism, doctrinal variations did not necessarily imply separate organizations, so the Mahāyāna movement spread within rather than institutionally separating itself from the early monastic orders. The same is generally true of Tibetan Buddhist monasticism; the monastic code followed is that of the Mūlasarvastivāda, an ancient Indian order. Tibetan Buddhists also share Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna (tantric) practices and perspectives, while they are divided into monastic orders are loosely organized schools based on different lineages of teachers and not, in most cases, on strictly doctrinal differences. Additionally, the main four traditions are Kaguy (bka' brgyud), Sakya (sa skya'), Nyingma (rnying ma), and Geluk (dge lugs), but each of these major schools contains groupings within it, which may be to a greater or lesser extent autonomous. Certain doctrinal positions or specialisms in specific practices are associated with each school, but just as in the ancient Buddhist orders, there are no rigid sectarian boundaries. Cantwell and Kawanami. Religions in the Modern World. Woodhead. p. 81. . The Buddhism of this branch derives from later Indian Buddhism especially of the Pāla dynasty (Bengal, eighth to twelfth centuries CE), incorporating Buddhist monastic scholarship, Mahāyāna, and tantric traditions. It preserves large collections of scriptural and commentarial texts in Tibetan language, including a comprehensive set of translations from Sanskrit sources as well as a vast indigenous literature. The four main traditions are Kagyu, Sakya, Nyingma, and Geluk, but each of these major schools contain groupings within it, which may be to a greater or lesser extent autonomous. Mahayana and Theravada in Asia The use and meaning of these terms reflects only the contemporary situation of the various schools of Buddhism in Asia, and even that only imperfectly. While the Theravada presently dominates in Southeast Asia, prior to the 13th Century the Mahayana was also well established in that region. The survival of certain Mahayana notions in popular Southeast Asian Buddhism (such as the worship of Lokesvara- a form of Avalokitesvara- in Thailand) reflect the early presence of Mahayana ideology in the \\"Southern Buddhist\\" world. Ongoing contact between Southeast Asia and India brought a variety of doctrines, relics, and texts into Southeast Asia from both the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions, as well as the Theravada and the other early Buddhist schools. Only after the decline of Buddhism in India did Theravada Buddhism begin to dominate in Southeast Asia, with Theravada-dominated Sri Lanka replacing India as the source of new texts and teachers. In East Asia and Tibet, the lands traditionally described as \\"Northern Buddhist\\", share Mahayana and Vajrayana (tantric) practices and perspectives, while they are divided into monastic orders or loosely organized schools based on different lineages of teachers and not, in most cases, on strictly doctrinal differences. The main four traditions are Kagyu, Sakya, Nyingma, and Geluk, but each of these major schools contains groupings within it, which may be to a greater or lesser extent autonomous.Cantwell and Kawanami. Religions in the Modern World. Woodhead. p. 80-81. . The historical evidence for the cohabitation of Mahayana and non-Mahayana monks in some South Asian monasteries during the spread of Buddhism from India to East Asia provides additional evidence that the form of Buddhism practiced in the \\"Northern\\" territories likely retains many non-Mahayana influences. Furthermore, in certain regions of China and East Asia (notably in Southern China), non-Mahayana forms were sometimes dominant. Vietnam represents an interesting case of a country lying in the liminal region between the Northern and Southern Buddhist schools. As might be expected, Vietnamese Buddhism shows both a strong Mahayana and Theravada influence. NotesReferences * Lopez Jr., Donald S., \\"Introduction in Buddhism in Practice, Donald S.

The 280 MW Solana Generating Station is designed to provide six hours of energy storage. This allows the plant to generate about 38 percent of its rated capacity over the course of a year. Thermal energy storage (TES) is achieved with widely differing technologies. Depending on the specific technology, it allows excess thermal energy to be stored and used hours, days, months later, at scales ranging from the individual process, building, multiuser-building, district, town, or region. Usage examples are the balancing of energy demand between daytime and nighttime, storing summer heat for winter heating, or winter cold for summer air conditioning (Seasonal thermal energy storage). Storage media include water or ice-slush tanks, masses of native earth or bedrock accessed with heat exchangers by means of boreholes, deep aquifers contained between impermeable strata; shallow, lined pits filled with gravel and water and insulated at the top, as well as eutectic solutions and phase-change materials.Saeed, R.M., Schlegel, J.P., Castano, C. and Sawafta, R., 2018.

Preparation and thermal performance of methyl palmitate and lauric acid eutectic mixture as phase change material (PCM). Journal of Energy Storage, 13, pp.418-424. Other sources of thermal energy for storage include heat or cold produced with heat pumps from off-peak, lower cost electric power, a practice called peak shaving; heat from combined heat and power (CHP) power plants; heat produced by renewable electrical energy that exceeds grid demand and waste heat from industrial processes. Heat storage, both seasonal and short term, is considered an important means for cheaply balancing high shares of variable renewable electricity production and integration of electricity and heating sectors in energy systems almost or completely fed by renewable energy. Solar energy storage Most practical active solar heating systems provide storage from a few hours to a day's worth of energy collected. However, there are a growing number of facilities that use seasonal thermal energy storage (STES), enabling solar energy to be stored in summer for space heating use during winter.Wong B. (2011). Drake Landing Solar Community . Presentation at IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference. Toronto, 26–29 June 2011.SunStor-4 Project, Marstal, Denmark. The solar district heating system, which has an interseasonal pit storage, is being expanded. The Drake Landing Solar Community in Alberta, Canada, has now achieved a year-round 97% solar heating fraction, a world record made possible only by incorporating STES. The use of both latent heat and sensible heat are also possible with high temperature solar thermal input. Various eutectic mixtures of metals, such as Aluminium and Silicon (AlSi12) offer a high melting point suited to efficient steam generation, while high alumina cement-based materials offer good thermal storage capabilities.  Molten-salt technology  Sensible heat of molten salt is also used for storing solar energy at a high temperature. It is termed molten-salt technology or molten-salt energy storage (MSES). Molten salts can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy. Presently, this is a commercially used technology to store the heat collected by concentrated solar power (e.g., from a solar tower or solar trough). The heat can later be converted into superheated steam to power conventional steam turbines and generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995-1999. Estimates in 2006 predicted an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. Various eutectic mixtures of different salts are used (e.g., sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate). Experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid. The salt melts at . It is kept liquid at in an insulated \\"cold\\" storage tank. The liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused sun heats it to . It is then sent to a hot storage tank. With proper insulation of the tank the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week. When electricity is needed, the hot molten salt is pumped to a conventional steam-generator to produce superheated steam for driving a conventional turbine/generator set as used in any coal or oil or nuclear power plant. A 100-megawatt turbine would need a tank of about tall and in diameter to drive it for four hours by this design. Single tank with divider plate to hold both cold and hot molten salt, is under development. It is more economical by achieving 100% more heat storage per unit volume over the dual tanks system as the molten-salt storage tank is costly due to its complicated construction. Phase Change Material (PCMs) are also used in molten-salt energy storage, while research on obtaining shape-stabilized PCMs using high porosity matrices is ongoing. Several parabolic trough power plants in SpainParabolic Trough Thermal Energy Storage Technology Parabolic Trough Solar Power Network. 4 April 2007. Accessed December 2007 and solar power tower developer SolarReserve use this thermal energy storage concept. The Solana Generating Station in the U.S. can store 6 hours worth of generating capacity in molten salt. During the summer of 2013 the Gemasolar Thermosolar solar power-tower/molten-salt plant in Spain achieved a first by continuously producing electricity 24 hours per day for 36 days.  Adsorption (or Sorption) solar heating and storage  The low cost ($200/ton) and high cycle rate (2,000X) of synthetic zeolites such as Linde 13X with water adsorbate has garnered much academic and commercial interest recently for use for thermal energy storage (TES), specifically of low-grade solar and waste heat. Several pilot projects have been funded in the EU from 2000 to the present (2020). The basic concept is to store solar thermal energy as chemical latent energy in the zeolite. Typically, hot dry air from flat plate solar collectors is made to flow through a bed of zeolite such that any water adsorbate present is driven off. Storage can be diurnal, weekly, monthly, or even seasonal depending on the volume of the zeolite and the area of the solar thermal panels. When heat is called for during the night, or sunless hours, or winter, humidified air flows through the zeolite. As the humidity is adsorbed by the zeolite, heat is released to the air and subsequently to the building space. This form of TES, with specific use of zeolites, was first taught by Guerra in 1978.U.S. Pat. No. 4,269,170, \\"Adsorption solar heating and storage\\"; Inventor: John M. Guerra; Granted May 26, 1981 Advantages over molten salts and other high temperature TES include that (1) the temperature required is only the stagnation temperature typical of a solar flat plate thermal collector, and (2) as long as the zeolite is kept dry, the energy is stored indefinitely. Because of the low temperature, and because the energy is stored as latent heat of adsorption, thus eliminating the insulation requirements of a molten salt storage system, costs are significantly lower. Heat storage in tanks or rock caverns A steam accumulator consists of an insulated steel pressure tank containing hot water and steam under pressure. As a heat storage device, it is used to mediate heat production by a variable or steady source from a variable demand for heat. Steam accumulators may take on a significance for energy storage in solar thermal energy projects. Large stores are widely used in Scandinavia to store heat for several days, to decouple heat and power production and to help meet peak demands. Interseasonal storage in caverns has been investigated and appears to be economical and plays a significant role in heating in Finland. Helen Oy estimates an 11.6 GWh capacity and 120 MW thermal output for its 260,000 m³ water cistern under Mustikkamaa (fully charged or discharged in 4 days at capacity), operating from 2021 to offset days of peak production/demand; while the 300,000 m³ rock caverns 50 m under sea level in Kruunuvuorenranta (near Laajasalo) were designated in 2018 to store heat in summer from warm seawater and release it in winter for district heating. Heat storage in hot rocks or concrete Water has one of the highest thermal capacities at 4.2 J/(cm3·K) whereas concrete has about one third of that. On the other hand, concrete can be heated to much higher temperatures (1200 °C) by for example electrical heating and therefore has a much higher overall volumetric capacity. Thus in the example below, an insulated cube of about 2.8 m³ would appear to provide sufficient storage for a single house to meet 50% of heating demand. This could, in principle, be used to store surplus wind or solar heat due to the ability of electrical heating to reach high temperatures. At the neighborhood level, the Wiggenhausen-Süd solar development at Friedrichshafen in southern Germany has received international attention. This features a 12,000 m³ (420,000 ft³) reinforced concrete thermal store linked to 4,300 m² (46,000 ft²) of solar collectors, which will supply the 570 houses with around 50% of their heating and hot water. Siemens-Gamesa built a 130 MWh thermal storage near Hamburg with 750 °C in basalt and 1.5 MW electric output. A similar system is scheduled for Sorø, Denmark, with 41-58% of the stored 18 MWh heat returned for the town's district heating, and 30-41% returned as electricity.  Miscibility gap alloy technology  Miscibility gap alloys rely on the phase change of a metallic material (see: latent heat) to store thermal energy. Rather than pumping the liquid metal between tanks as in a molten-salt system, the metal is encapsulated in another metallic material that it cannot alloy with (immiscible). Depending on the two materials selected (the phase changing material and the encapsulating material) storage densities can be between 0.2 and 2 MJ/L. A working fluid, typically water or steam, is used to transfer the heat into and out of the system. Thermal conductivity of miscibility gap alloys is often higher (up to 400 W/m·K) than competing technologies which means quicker \\"charge\\" and \\"discharge\\" of the thermal storage is possible. The technology has not yet been implemented on a large scale. Electric thermal storage heaters Storage heaters are commonplace in European homes with time-of-use metering (traditionally using cheaper electricity at night time). They consist of high- density ceramic bricks or feolite blocks heated to a high temperature with electricity, and may or may not have good insulation and controls to release heat over a number of hours. AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF AN ELECTRICAL STORAGE HEATER Ice-based technology Several applications are being developed where ice is produced during off-peak periods and used for cooling at a later time. For example, air conditioning can be provided more economically by using low-cost electricity at night to freeze water into ice, then using the cooling capacity of ice in the afternoon to reduce the electricity needed to handle air conditioning demands. Thermal energy storage using ice makes use of the large heat of fusion of water. Historically, ice was transported from mountains to cities for use as a coolant. One metric ton of water (= one cubic meter) can store 334 million joules (MJ) or 317,000 BTUs (93 kWh). A relatively small storage facility can hold enough ice to cool a large building for a day or a week. In addition to using ice in direct cooling applications, it is also being used in heat pump based heating systems. In these applications, the phase change energy provides a very significant layer of thermal capacity that is near the bottom range of temperature that water source heat pumps can operate in. This allows the system to ride out the heaviest heating load conditions and extends the timeframe by which the source energy elements can contribute heat back into the system. Cryogenic energy storage Cryogenic energy storage uses liquification of air or nitrogen as an energy store. A pilot cryogenic energy system that uses liquid air as the energy store, and low-grade waste heat to drive the thermal re-expansion of the air, operated at a power station in Slough, UK in 2010.  Hot silicon technology  Solid or molten silicon offers much higher storage temperatures than salts with consequent greater capacity and efficiency. It is being researched as a possible more energy efficient storage technology. Silicon is able to store more than 1 MWh of energy per cubic metre at 1400 °C. Molten silicon thermal energy storage is being developed by the Australian company 1414 Degrees as a more energy efficient storage technology, with a combined heat and power (cogeneration) output.  Pumped-heat electricity storage  In pumped-heat electricity storage (PHES), a reversible heat-pump system is used to store energy as a temperature difference between two heat stores. =Isentropic= One system which was being developed by the now-bankrupt UK company Isentropic operates as follows. It involves two insulated containers filled with crushed rock or gravel; a hot vessel storing thermal energy at high temperature and high pressure, and a cold vessel storing thermal energy at low temperature and low pressure. The vessels are connected at top and bottom by pipes and the whole system is filled with the inert gas argon. During the charging cycle, the system uses off-peak electricity to work as a heat pump. Argon at ambient temperature and pressure from the top of the cold store is compressed adiabatically to a pressure of 12 bar, heating it to around . The compressed gas is transferred to the top of the hot vessel where it percolates down through the gravel, transferring its heat to the rock and cooling to ambient temperature. The cooled, but still pressurized, gas emerging at the bottom of the vessel is then expanded (again adiabatically) back down to 1 bar, which lowers its temperature to -150 °C. The cold gas is then passed up through the cold vessel where it cools the rock while being warmed back to its initial condition. The energy is recovered as electricity by reversing the cycle. The hot gas from the hot vessel is expanded to drive a generator and then supplied to the cold store. The cooled gas retrieved from the bottom of the cold store is compressed which heats the gas to ambient temperature. The gas is then transferred to the bottom of the hot vessel to be reheated. The compression and expansion processes are provided by a specially designed reciprocating machine using sliding valves. Surplus heat generated by inefficiencies in the process is shed to the environment through heat exchangers during the discharging cycle. The developer claimed that a round trip efficiency of 72-80% was achievable. This compares to >80% achievable with pumped hydro energy storage. Another proposed system uses turbomachinery and is capable of operating at much higher power levels. Use of phase change material as heat storage material would enhance the performance further.  Endothermic/exothermic chemical reactions Salt hydrate technology= One example of an experimental storage system based on chemical reaction energy is the salt hydrate technology. The system uses the reaction energy created when salts are hydrated or dehydrated. It works by storing heat in a container containing 50% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. Heat (e.g. from using a solar collector) is stored by evaporating the water in an endothermic reaction. When water is added again, heat is released in an exothermic reaction at 50 °C (120 °F). Current systems operate at 60% efficiency. The system is especially advantageous for seasonal thermal energy storage, because the dried salt can be stored at room temperature for prolonged times, without energy loss. The containers with the dehydrated salt can even be transported to a different location. The system has a higher energy density than heat stored in water and the capacity of the system can be designed to store energy from a few months to years. In 2013 the Dutch technology developer TNO presented the results of the MERITS project to store heat in a salt container. The heat, which can be derived from a solar collector on a rooftop, expels the water contained in the salt. When the water is added again, the heat is released, with almost no energy losses. A container with a few cubic meters of salt could store enough of this thermochemical energy to heat a house throughout the winter. In a temperate climate like that of the Netherlands, an average low-energy household requires about 6.7 GJ/winter. To store this energy in water (at a temperature difference of 70 °C), 23 m3 insulated water storage would be needed, exceeding the storage abilities of most households. Using salt hydrate technology with a storage density of about 1 GJ/m3, 4–8 m3 could be sufficient.MERITS project Compact Heat Storage. As of 2016, researchers in several countries are conducting experiments to determine the best type of salt, or salt mixture. Low pressure within the container seems favourable for the energy transport. Especially promising are organic salts, so called ionic liquids. Compared to lithium halide based sorbents they are less problematic in terms of limited global resources, and compared to most other halides and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) they are less corrosive and not negatively affected by CO2 contaminations. = Molecular bonds = Storing energy in molecular bonds is being investigated. Energy densities equivalent to lithium-ion batteries have been achieved.

Constructivism was an artistic and architectural philosophy that originated in Russia beginning in 1915 by Vladimir Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko. Abstract and austere, constructivist art aimed to reflect modern industrial society and urban space. The movement rejected decorative stylization in favor of the industrial assemblage of materials. Constructivists were in favour of art for propaganda and social purposes, and were associated with Soviet socialism, the Bolsheviks and the Russian avant-garde. Constructivist architecture and art had a great effect on modern art movements of the 20th century, influencing major trends such as the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements. Its influence was widespread, with major effects upon architecture, sculpture, graphic design, industrial design, theatre, film, dance, fashion and, to some extent, music. Beginnings The cover of Konstruktivizm by Aleksei Gan, 1922. The term Construction Art was first used as a derisive term by Kazimir Malevich to describe the work of Alexander Rodchenko in 1917. Constructivism first appears as a positive term in Naum Gabo's Realistic Manifesto of 1920. Aleksei Gan used the word as the title of his book Constructivism, printed in 1922.Catherine Cooke, Russian Avant-Garde: Theories of Art, Architecture and the City, Academy Editions, 1995, page 106. Constructivism was a post-World War I development of Russian Futurism, and particularly of the 'counter reliefs' of Vladimir Tatlin, which had been exhibited in 1915. The term itself would be invented by the sculptors Antoine Pevsner and Naum Gabo, who developed an industrial, angular style of work, while its geometric abstraction owed something to the Suprematism of Kazimir Malevich. Constructivism as theory and practice was derived largely from a series of debates at the Institute of Artistic Culture (INKhUK) in Moscow, from 1920 to 1922. After deposing its first chairman, Wassily Kandinsky, for his 'mysticism', The First Working Group of Constructivists (including Liubov Popova, Alexander Vesnin, Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova, and the theorists Aleksei Gan, Boris Arvatov and Osip Brik) would develop a definition of Constructivism as the combination of faktura: the particular material properties of an object, and tektonika, its spatial presence. Initially the Constructivists worked on three-dimensional constructions as a means of participating in industry: the OBMOKhU (Society of Young Artists) exhibition showed these three dimensional compositions, by Rodchenko, Stepanova, Karl Ioganson and the Stenberg brothers. Later the definition would be extended to designs for two-dimensional works such as books or posters, with montage and factography becoming important concepts. Art in the service of the Revolution Agitprop poster by Mayakovsky As much as involving itself in designs for industry, the Constructivists worked on public festivals and street designs for the post-October revolution Bolshevik government. Perhaps the most famous of these was in Vitebsk, where Malevich's UNOVIS Group painted propaganda plaques and buildings (the best known being El Lissitzky's poster Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge (1919)). Inspired by Vladimir Mayakovsky's declaration 'the streets our brushes, the squares our palettes', artists and designers participated in public life during the Civil War. A striking instance was the proposed festival for the Comintern congress in 1921 by Alexander Vesnin and Liubov Popova, which resembled the constructions of the OBMOKhU exhibition as well as their work for the theatre. There was a great deal of overlap during this period between Constructivism and Proletkult, the ideas of which concerning the need to create an entirely new culture struck a chord with the Constructivists. In addition some Constructivists were heavily involved in the 'ROSTA Windows', a Bolshevik public information campaign of around 1920. Some of the most famous of these were by the poet-painter Vladimir Mayakovsky and Vladimir Lebedev. The constructivists tried to create works that would make the viewer an active viewer of the artwork. In this it had similarities with the Russian Formalists' theory of 'making strange', and accordingly their main theorist Viktor Shklovsky worked closely with the Constructivists, as did other formalists like the Arch Bishop. These theories were tested in theatre, particularly with the work of Vsevolod Meyerhold, who had established what he called 'October in the theatre'. Meyerhold developed a 'biomechanical' acting style, which was influenced both by the circus and by the 'scientific management' theories of Frederick Winslow Taylor. Meanwhile, the stage sets by the likes of Vesnin, Popova and Stepanova tested Constructivist spatial ideas in a public form. A more populist version of this was developed by Alexander Tairov, with stage sets by Aleksandra Ekster and the Stenberg brothers. These ideas would influence German directors like Bertolt Brecht and Erwin Piscator, as well as the early Soviet cinema. Tatlin, 'Construction Art' and Productivism The key work of Constructivism was Vladimir Tatlin's proposal for the Monument to the Third International (Tatlin's Tower) (1919–20)Honour, H. and Fleming, J. (2009) A World History of Art. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 819. which combined a machine aesthetic with dynamic components celebrating technology such as searchlights and projection screens. Gabo publicly criticized Tatlin's design saying, \\"Either create functional houses and bridges or create pure art, not both.\\" This had already caused a major controversy in the Moscow group in 1920 when Gabo and Pevsner's Realistic Manifesto asserted a spiritual core for the movement. This was opposed to the utilitarian and adaptable version of Constructivism held by Tatlin and Rodchenko. Tatlin's work was immediately hailed by artists in Germany as a revolution in art: a 1920 photograph shows George Grosz and John Heartfield holding a placard saying 'Art is Dead – Long Live Tatlin's Machine Art', while the designs for the tower were published in Bruno Taut's magazine Fruhlicht. The tower was never built, however, due to a lack of money following the revolution.Janson, H.W. (1995) History of Art. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: Thames & Hudson, p. 820. Tatlin's tower started a period of exchange of ideas between Moscow and Berlin, something reinforced by El Lissitzky and Ilya Ehrenburg's Soviet- German magazine Veshch-Gegenstand-Objet which spread the idea of 'Construction art', as did the Constructivist exhibits at the 1922 Russische Ausstellung in Berlin, organised by Lissitzky. A Constructivist International was formed, which met with Dadaists and De Stijl artists in Germany in 1922. Participants in this short-lived international included Lissitzky, Hans Richter, and László Moholy-Nagy. However the idea of 'art' was becoming anathema to the Russian Constructivists: the INKhUK debates of 1920–22 had culminated in the theory of Productivism propounded by Osip Brik and others, which demanded direct participation in industry and the end of easel painting. Tatlin was one of the first to attempt to transfer his talents to industrial production, with his designs for an economical stove, for workers' overalls and for furniture. The Utopian element in Constructivism was maintained by his 'letatlin', a flying machine which he worked on until the 1930s. Constructivism and consumerism In 1921, the New Economic Policy was established in the Soviet Union, which opened up more market opportunities in the Soviet economy. Rodchenko, Stepanova, and others made advertising for the co-operatives that were now in competition with other commercial businesses. The poet-artist Vladimir Mayakovsky and Rodchenko worked together and called themselves \\"advertising constructors\\". Together they designed eye-catching images featuring bright colours, geometric shapes, and bold lettering. The lettering of most of these designs was intended to create a reaction, and function emotionally – most were designed for the state-owned department store Mosselprom in Moscow, for pacifiers, cooking oil, beer and other quotidian products, with Mayakovsky claiming that his 'nowhere else but Mosselprom' verse was one of the best he ever wrote. Additionally, several artists tried to work with clothes design with varying success: Varvara Stepanova designed dresses with bright, geometric patterns that were mass-produced, although workers' overalls by Tatlin and Rodchenko never achieved this and remained prototypes. The painter and designer Lyubov Popova designed a kind of Constructivist flapper dress before her early death in 1924, the plans for which were published in the journal LEF. In these works, Constructivists showed a willingness to involve themselves in fashion and the mass market, which they tried to balance with their Communist beliefs. LEF and Constructivist cinema The Soviet Constructivists organised themselves in the 1920s into the 'Left Front of the Arts', who produced the influential journal LEF, (which had two series, from 1923–5 and from 1927–9 as New LEF). LEF was dedicated to maintaining the avant-garde against the critiques of the incipient Socialist Realism, and the possibility of a capitalist restoration, with the journal being particularly scathing about the 'NEPmen', the capitalists of the period. For LEF the new medium of cinema was more important than the easel painting and traditional narratives that elements of the Communist Party were trying to revive then. Important Constructivists were very involved with cinema, with Mayakovsky acting in the film The Young Lady and the Hooligan (1919), Rodchenko's designs for the intertitles and animated sequences of Dziga Vertov's Kino Eye (1924), and Aleksandra Ekster designs for the sets and costumes of the science fiction film Aelita (1924). The Productivist theorists Osip Brik and Sergei Tretyakov also wrote screenplays and intertitles, for films such as Vsevolod Pudovkin's Storm over Asia (1928) or Victor Turin's Turksib (1929). The filmmakers and LEF contributors Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein as well as the documentarist Esfir Shub also regarded their fast-cut, montage style of filmmaking as Constructivist. The early Eccentrist movies of Grigori Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg (The New Babylon, Alone) had similarly avant-garde intentions, as well as a fixation on jazz-age America which was characteristic of the philosophy, with its praise of slapstick-comedy actors like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, as well as of Fordist mass production. Like the photomontages and designs of Constructivism, early Soviet cinema concentrated on creating an agitating effect by montage and 'making strange'. Photography and photomontage The Constructivists were early developers of the techniques of photomontage. Gustav Klutsis' 'Dynamic City' and 'Lenin and Electrification' (1919–20) are the first examples of this method of montage, which had in common with Dadaism the collaging together of news photographs and painted sections. However Constructivist montages would be less 'destructive' than those of Dadaism. Perhaps the most famous of these montages was Rodchenko's illustrations of the Mayakovsky poem About This. LEF also helped popularise a distinctive style of photography, involving jagged angles and contrasts and an abstract use of light, which paralleled the work of László Moholy-Nagy in Germany: The major practitioners of this included, along with Rodchenko, Boris Ignatovich and Max Penson, among others. This also shared many characteristics with the early documentary movement. Constructivist graphic design 'Proun Vrashchenia' by El Lissitzky, 1919 The book designs of Rodchenko, El Lissitzky and others such as Solomon Telingater and Anton Lavinsky were a major inspiration for the work of radical designers in the West, particularly Jan Tschichold. Many Constructivists worked on the design of posters for everything from cinema to political propaganda: the former represented best by the brightly coloured, geometric posters of the Stenberg brothers (Georgii and Vladimir Stenberg), and the latter by the agitational photomontage work of Gustav Klutsis and Valentina Kulagina. In Cologne in the late 1920s Figurative Constructivism emerged from the Cologne Progressives, a group which had links with Russian Constructivists, particularly Lissitzky, since the early twenties. Through their collaboration with Otto Neurath and the Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum such artists as Gerd Antz, Augustin Tschinkel and Peter Alma they affected the development of the Vienna Method. This link was most clearly shown in A bis Z a journal published by Franz Seiwert the principal theorist of the group.Benus B. (2013) 'Figurative Constructivism and sociological graphics' in Isotype: Design and Contexts 1925-71 London: Hyphen Press, pp.216–248 They were active in Russia working with IZOSTAT and Tschinkel worked with Ladislav Sutnar before he emigrated to the US. The Constructivists' main early political patron was Leon Trotsky, and it began to be regarded with suspicion after the expulsion of Trotsky and the Left Opposition in 1927-8. The Communist Party would gradually favour realist art during the course of the 1920s (as early as 1918 Pravda had complained that government funds were being used to buy works by untried artists). However it was not until about 1934 that the counter-doctrine of Socialist Realism was instituted in Constructivism's place. Many Constructivists continued to produce avantgarde work in the service of the state, such as Lissitzky, Rodchenko and Stepanova's designs for the magazine USSR In Construction. Constructivist architecture Constructivist architecture emerged from the wider constructivist art movement. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, it turned its attentions to the new social demands and industrial tasks required of the new regime. Two distinct threads emerged, the first was encapsulated in Antoine Pevsner's and Naum Gabo's Realist manifesto which was concerned with space and rhythm, the second represented a struggle within the Commissariat for Enlightenment between those who argued for pure art and the Productivists such as Alexander Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova and Vladimir Tatlin, a more socially oriented group who wanted this art to be absorbed in industrial production. A split occurred in 1922 when Pevsner and Gabo emigrated. The movement then developed along socially utilitarian lines. The productivist majority gained the support of the Proletkult and the magazine LEF, and later became the dominant influence of the architectural group O.S.A., directed by Alexander Vesnin and Moisei Ginzburg. Legacy A number of Constructivists would teach or lecture at the Bauhaus schools in Germany, and some of the VKhUTEMAS teaching methods were adopted and developed there. Gabo established a version of Constructivism in England during the 1930s and 1940s that was adopted by architects, designers and artists after World War I (see Victor Pasmore), and John McHale. Joaquín Torres García and Manuel Rendón were instrumental in spreading Constructivism throughout Europe and Latin America. Constructivism had an effect on the modern masters of Latin America such as: Carlos Mérida, Enrique Tábara, Aníbal Villacís, Theo Constanté, Oswaldo Viteri, Estuardo Maldonado, Luis Molinari, Carlos Catasse, João Batista Vilanova Artigas and Oscar Niemeyer, to name just a few. There have also been disciples in Australia, the painter George Johnson being the best known. In New Zealand, the sculptures of Peter Nicholls show the influence of constructivism. In the 1980s graphic designer Neville Brody used styles based on Constructivist posters that initiated a revival of popular interest. Also during the 1980s designer Ian Anderson founded The Designers Republic, a successful and influential design company which used constructivist principles. =Deconstructivism= So-called Deconstructivist architecture shares elements of approach with Constructivism (its name refers more to the deconstruction literary approach). It was developed by architects Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas and others during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Zaha Hadid by her sketches and drawings of abstract triangles and rectangles evokes the aesthetic of constructivism. Though similar formally, the socialist political connotations of Russian constructivism are deemphasized by Hadid's deconstructivism. Rem Koolhaas' projects revive another aspect of constructivism. The scaffold and crane-like structures represented by many constructivist architects are used for the finished forms of his designs and buildings.

Early life Boško Buha was born into a Serb family in the Slavonian village of Gradina, near Virovitica in today's Croatia. In 1941, after the Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia, his family was targeted by the Ustaša and had to seek shelter in Serbia. Career Buha eventually reached territory under Partisan control. There he tried to join the Partisans, but he was rejected due to his young age (at the time he was only 15). After a few attempts, he managed to con his way into the Partisans and took part in active combat. In 1942, he joined the 2nd Proletarian Brigade of YNLA. Soon he developed a talent for sneaking towards enemy bunkers and destroying them with hand grenades (as part of the Bombaši). His talent and bravery almost immediately became stuff of legends and his unit, which had many young men and teenagers, was nicknamed the \\"Partisan Artillery\\". In late 1942, Buha was publicly commended by Tito. A year later, Buha died when he was ambushed by Chetniks. After the war, Boško Buha received the title of People's Hero of Yugoslavia. Legacy A theatre house in Belgrade is named after him. In 1979, director Branko Bauer made a film about his life.

The school currently caters for approximately 1300 students, including 210 boarders, on its site. The school often collaborates with the very close-by New Plymouth Girls' High School. For example, the Hillary Challenge team for New Plymouth always draws students from both schools and the jazz band and concert band include musicians from both schools. History New Plymouth Boys' High School was founded in 1882 and celebrated its 125th Jubilee in 2007. Thomas Shailer Weston was for some time a governor of the school.

Students are sorted alphabetically into their houses, with the exception of Hatherly, which consists of boarders only. * Barak – green * Donnelly – blue * Hatherly – red * Syme – yellow Huia Ropū system Huia Ropū (formerly called Groups) is a class attended by all students on a Wednesday period 4 (the period 4 class gets shifted into period 3's time, and the original period 3 class gets lost). In the class, students learn about a variety of topics, including time management, mindfulness, anti-bullying, goal setting and career path planning, among others. Students stay in their Huia group throughout their time in school. There are 15 ropū per house, and each ropū is referenced by the first letter of its house followed by its number (e.g. D13 for Donnelly #13). Facilities In 2008, the school acquired a new wing (now known as the French-Wright Block, named for the former headmaster Lyal French-Wright ) with facilities for administration, science and mathematics. The wing incorporates modern architecture to add a new flavor to the traditional school. The wing was opened by the Prime Minister at the time, Helen Clark. The school has a boarding hostel, providing accommodation for up to 200 boys. Student-based radio station New Plymouth Boys' High also had their own radio station named \\"Gully FM\\" (however this is discontinued), as the school's \\"Gully Grounds\\" (the terrace-style rugby field of Boys' High) are a major part of New Plymouth Boys' High. Gully FM broadcast locally to New Plymouth on 87.9 FM. Gully FM was founded in 2011 after a small group of students got together and put forward a proposal to the headmaster. Gully FM mainly broadcast pop, modern rock and dubstep aimed at the students of the school. United Space School New Plymouth Boys' High School and New Plymouth Girls' High School are the only New Zealand schools to take part in the Foundation for International Space Education's United Space School which is held in Houston, Texas each year. One student from each school (and in 2009 a teacher), is selected to attend. Exchange programme A student exchange program has been established with a Chilean High School, Colegio San Nicolás de Myra, so that every year students alternate exchanges between New Plymouth and Santiago. In 2006, NPBHS travelled to Chile for the first time, and the next year students from Chile came to NPBHS in return. This exchange has continued into the present, and is run through NPBHS by Tineka Twigley. The school also associates with schools in New Plymouth's sister cities in China and Japan. Controversy over bullying After an incident in 2008 when a boarder was beaten by four other students the school's board of trustees commissioned an independent report on bullying in November 2008. The report, released in late January 2009, identified a culture of bullying amongst students in the school's hostel, although the school's board of trustees disputed some of the report's findings. A 2010 Education Review Office review of the school did not highlight any bullying issues, and gave the school a positive report. Notable alumni Many successful men have come from the school, including Australian Idol winner Stan Walker, musicians Matt Thomas, Hayden Chisholm, former Chief of the Royal New Zealand Navy Rear Admiral Tony Parr, David Gauld (president of the New Zealand Mathematical Society 1981–82), the author and journalist John McBeth, and 24 All Blacks. In 2018, Professor Emeritus David Penny received one of the highest honours in the science world, to be named a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) foreign associate. Members of Parliament who attended the school include Andrew Little, John Armstrong, Bruce Beetham, Merv Wellington, Cam Calder and Ken Comber. Harry Barker was mayor of Gisborne for 27 years.

The film received mostly negative reviews.  Plot  Years ago, a mob boss named Lucio Malatesta (George Touliatos) pinned the murder of rival Sammy Carboni (Gino Marrocco) on another rival named Angelo Allieghieri (Anthony Quinn), which led to Sammy's son Gianni vowing revenge. Frankie Delano (Sylvester Stallone) has spent his life safeguarding Angelo as well as Angelo's daughter, Jennifer Barrett (Madeleine Stowe), whose unsavory husband Kip Barrett (Harry Van Gorkum) has had their young son Rawley (Ezra Perlman) placed in a boarding school against Jennifer's wishes. Jennifer was raised by her adoptive parents Whitney Towers (John Gilbert) and Peggy Towers (Dawn Greenhalgh) and is not aware that Angelo is her father. After Angelo is killed in a restaurant by a hit man named Bruno (Billy Gardell), Frankie introduces himself, tells Jennifer who he is and what he has been doing. A neurotic mess, Jennifer can barely handle the news that Kip is a philanderer, let alone the revelation that she is a gangster's daughter. But a DVD prepared by Angelo in the case of just such an event convinces Jennifer that it's the truth. Jennifer certainly doesn't want a full-time bodyguard, even Frankie. She ditches Kip and then falls for Italian romance novelist Marcello (Raoul Bova), who lectures at her book club. Frankie has suspicions about Marcello, but his job is to stay on the sidelines. Frankie rescues Jennifer from a string of attacks. With many of Angelo's enemies, including Lucio Malatesta, terminated, Frankie allows her to visit Italy with Marcello. But it turns out that Marcello is actually Gianni Carboni, who had Angelo killed. And now Gianni plans to kill Jennifer. It is up to Frankie to protect her one more time.

The area falls within the Whitley Ward of the Wakefield Metropolitan Council. Barnsdale is historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Barnsdale lies in the immediate vicinity north and northwest of Doncaster, and which was formerly forested and a place of royal hunts, and also renowned as a haunt of the outlaw Robin Hood in early ballads. Boundaries and features of Barnsdale Barnsdale historically falls within the West Riding of Yorkshire. The southern villages within Barnsdale are today part of the ceremonial county of South Yorkshire, more specifically part of the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster, but the villages and hamlets of northern Barnsdale fall within the Metropolitan District of the City of Wakefield in the ceremonial county of West Yorkshire. The small South Yorkshire village of Hampole is generally considered to lie within the dead centre of what was once the Barnsdale Forest area . It is recorded that Richard Rolle (1300–1349), the famous Latin and English religious writer and Bible translator, spent his final years at Hampole as a hermit, secluded in the dense forest. The area was once thick woodland, rich with game and deer; and the monarchs of England are sometimes recorded as having gone on royal hunts in the Barnsdale forest. It is believed that at some point in the early medieval era, Barnsdale Forest was probably huge and may have covered most of South Yorkshire (in the same manner as Sherwood Forest probably once covered most of Nottinghamshire). It is possible that the large town of Barnsley, some to the west of Hampole, got its name from the forest. Barnsdale Bar is the site of the junction of the A1 (the historic Great North Road), the A639, and Wrangbrook Lane, Woodfield Road and Long Lane (junction 38 of the A1). Now a service area lies just north of the junction, about eight miles north-northwest of Doncaster. Three limestone quarries exist nearby, and archeological digs at the site have turned up some fascinating materials, architecture, and preserved farmland dating back to the medieval era, the Dark Ages, and beyond.Read article here . White Ley Road, looking north east from the footpath entrance to Barnsdale Wood All that now exists of Barnsdale Forest is small gatherings of trees at the side of the A1 trunk road at Barnsdale Bar . There is however a wooded area around a half a mile wide, lying around a mile south of Hampole. It is called Hampole Wood, and although a small wood, the trees there may be direct descendants of the trees of Barnsdale Forest. The same could be said of the woodland that resides around a nearby stately home, Brodsworth Hall. At Woodlands there is Hanging Wood, which was also part of Barnsdale Forest. At Barnsdale Bar there is a 1,226 yard railway tunnel which, although closed to passenger traffic in 1932 and completely closed in 1959, is in remarkable condition and is part of the former Hull and Barnsley Railway.  Connections between the Barnsdale area and the Robin Hood legend  Golf course in Barnsdale. In the earliest medieval ballads of Robin Hood, which date from the fifteenth century, the outlaw is stated as having made Barnsdale Forest his abode and base of operations (for example, in \\"Robin Hood and Guy of Gisbourne\\", and in \\"A Gest of Robyn Hode\\" A Gest of Robyn Hood). Notable locations within the forest of Barnsdale which are directly related to the Robin Hood legend include the villages of Wentbridge and Campsall. There is also Robin Hood's Well, a small monument (apparently designed by John Vanbrugh) lying right next to the A1 between the Red House junction and Barnsdale Bar, in between the villages of Skelbrooke and Burghwallis. However, it was moved around 1960 when the junction was being constructed, so the real well is actually beneath the A1. Yet another well - Little John's Well - lies to the west of Hampole, between Wrangbrook and Skelbrooke (but closer to the latter). It is also called Little John's Cave. Situated by the A638, to the west of Barnsdale, it was once engraved with the outlaw's name, but is now derelict. South of Barnsdale Bar, the A1 follows the old Roman Road of Ermine Street - north of Barnsdale Bar the A639 follows the course of the Roman Road more closely whilst the A1 follows a more recent route. A number of villages and geological features along this route are mentioned in the early ballads of Robin Hood as being places the outlaw would visit. In Hanging Wood, also known as Highfields Wood, which lies between Hampole and Highfields, a small stream known as Robin Hood's stream springs from underneath the Roman Road and runs into the Pick Burn.  The 'Woodlands' Model Village  A feature of modern-day Barnsdale is the model village of Woodlands which lies about 4 miles south of Barnsdale Bar between the Roman Road and the historic Great North Road, here numbered as the A638 following the construction in 1960 of the A1(M) Doncaster by-pass.

Early life Bruce Edward Jesson was the son of Victor John and Edna Cavell (née Taylor) Jesson and the great-grandson of an immigrant from Leicestershire in England. He was educated at Christchurch Boys' High School (where he read Darwin's Origin of Species while a \\"lab boy\\" in the biology laboratory and became an atheist) and the University of Canterbury, where he gained a bachelor's degree in law. He worked briefly as a law clerk, but refused to swear allegiance to the Queen, and was never admitted to the Bar. Political activism As a student in the 1960s, he was initially attracted to the Communist Party of New Zealand which tried to groom him to be the party's lawyer. The CPNZ had been the first communist party in the world to side with China in the Sino-Soviet split. However, Jesson struck out on his own, writing a number of polemics such as Traitors to Class and Country: A Study of the Conservative Left and publishing a journal called Te Tao (\\"The Spear\\"). As a student he was involved in anti- Royalist activities, being associated with the burning of a New Zealand flag by another student during a visit by the Queen Mother. He founded the Committee to Oppose Royal Tours (CORT). =Republicanism= Jesson was a republican who championed an independent political and intellectual culture in New Zealand. He rebelled against the habit of the New Zealand Left to take its political cues from overseas countries. He founded the anti-royal Republican Association in 1966, later moving to Auckland (first to Pokeno, later Otahuhu and finally Mangere) and forming a political party (the original Republican Party) to push the republic issue in 1967. Around 1970 he also associated briefly with Trotskyist activists such as Owen Gager and David Bedggood, and he contributed occasionally to journals such as Dispute, New Zealand Monthly Review and Spartacist Spasmodical. When activity in the fledgling Republican Party petered out, Jesson wound up the party in 1974, but continued to publish a widely read pro-republican broadsheet entitled The Republican (1974–1995), covering both republican and leftwing issues in a plain and unpretentious style. This journal also featured articles by many other New Zealand leftists. (The Republican merged into Chris Trotter's New Zealand Political Review in 1995). Jesson was a founding member of the Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand, until his death in 1999. By this time, Jesson – who never had much of a steady career, working variously as labourer, wool presser, baker, dustman and freezing worker – was living with his wife Joce (Jocelyn née Brown), an educationist and tutor/lecturer, and worked as a househusband as well as pursuing his writing. He was interested in developing an indigenous Marxian tradition in New Zealand, and participated in the four NZ Marxian Political Economy conferences staged in the 1970s and early 1980s. =Maori Sovereignty= Around the time of the mass protests against the Springbok rugby tour of New Zealand in 1981, he associated with Māori activists such as Donna Awatere, Dun Mihaka, Syd Jackson and Ripeka Evans who sought to put Māori nationalism on the political agenda. The first drafts of Awatere's famous book Maori Sovereignty were published in The Republican. Mainstream publications It was only late in his life that Jesson became better known to the general public, as a political columnist for Auckland's Metro magazine and contributor to other magazines such as North & South and New Zealand Political Review. He also published four books about the neo-liberal revolution in New Zealand, and became a fellow of the Auckland University Political Science Department. Entering politics In 1990, Jesson joined Jim Anderton's Labour party splinter NewLabour Party. He stood as a candidate for the party in the Panmure electorate in . He again stood in Panmure in , for the Alliance. In 1991, he was elected to the Auckland Regional Council in a by-election as an Alliance candidate. He became chair of the Auckland Regional Services Trust between 1992 and 1995. Death Jesson died of cancer in the Auckland suburb of Mangere Bridge on 30 April 1999. Legacy An anthology of his later articles has been published posthumously as Bruce Jesson: To Build a Nation – Collected Writings 1975 – 1999 (2005). The Bruce Jesson papers are archived at the University of Auckland Library. The Bruce Jesson Foundation was established in his honour in 1999.

The Yuen Yuen Institute is the only temple in Hong Kong dedicated to all three major Chinese religions: Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism. The first three Chinese characters of the Institute's name denote the essence of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism respectively, so as to advocate the integration and realization of the three religions' teachings. The main building at the Institute is a replica of the Temple of Heaven (Tian Tan) in Beijing. In 1968, Moy Lin-shin co-founded (together with Taoist Masters Mui Ming-to and Mrs Tang Yuen Mei) the temple for the Fung Loy Kok Institute of Taoism on the grounds of the Yuen Yuen Institute.

They specialize in exploitation films, particularly the works of Harry Novak, Doris Wishman, David F. Friedman and Herschell Gordon Lewis. The company is named after Lewis' 1967 film Something Weird, and the logo is taken from that film's original poster art. Something Weird usually focus on B to Z movies. It has distributed well over 2,500 films to date. On January 2, 2014, the company's founder Mike Vraney died after a lengthy battle with lung cancer. The company continues under the leadership of Vraney's widow, Lisa Petrucci. History Something Weird Video was founded in 1990 by Mike Vraney in Seattle. He was inspired by his teenage job as a theater projectionist. His love for the obscure films that never made it to video prompted him to transfer hundreds of ancient reels of film to VHS videotape and DVD. On the company website, Vraney explains the label's genesis: > In my mind, the last great genre to be scavenged were the exploitation / > sexploitation films of the '30s through the '70s. After looking into this > further, I realized that there were nearly 2,000 movies out there yet to be > discovered. So with this for inspiration, my quest began and wouldn't you > know, just out of the blue I fell into a large collection of 16 mm girlie > arcade loops (which became the first compilation videos we put together). > Around the same time I received an unexpected phone call that suddenly made > all this real: my future and hands-down the king of sexploitation Dave > Friedman was on the other end of the line. This would be the beginning of a > long and fruitful friendship for both of us. Dave's films became the > building blocks for our film collection and he has taught and guided me > through the wonderful world of sexploitation, introducing me to his > colleagues (Dan Sonney, Harry Novak, H. G. Lewis, Bob Cresse and all the > other colorful characters who were involved during his heyday) and they've > been eager to dive into the business again. Content The content offered by Something Weird runs the gamut of exploitation cinema. Subgenres offered include films centering on burlesque and striptease shows, nudist exposes and features, drug and driver's education shorts, stag and peepshow loops, softcore and hardcore shorts and features, horror, particularly splatter films, sword-and-sandal spectaculars, spaghetti westerns, trailer compilations such as the Dusk to Dawn Drive-In Trash-O-Rama Show, TV rarities, jungle films and films featuring all-black casts. Something Weird initially offered their product on VHS with colorful covers using the original film artwork. In 1999 they made the transition to DVD, partnering with Image Entertainment to release their titles. Something Weird's videos are available on demand to Comcast subscribers. Among the series of titles within their library are Kid's Commercials from the Golden Age of Television, Hey Folks It's Intermission Time and Campy Classroom Classics.

It was directed by Craig Rosenberg, who also penned the screenplay. The score was composed by Craig's brother, Brett Rosenberg. Plot Rachel Carlson (Moore) is a successful American murder mystery author living in London with her five-year-old son, Thomas (Balawi) and her second husband, Brian (Cusick), a successful book editor who has been unable to get any of his own works published. His mother being too busy working on her latest novel to play with him, Thomas goes outside to play outside their canalside home, only to accidentally drown, devastating Rachel and putting a tailspin on her marriage and her ability to finish her latest novel. Several months later, Rachel still blames herself for the death of her son, and is not only unable to finish her book but is also a simple signature away from formally being divorced from her husband. In an effort to finish her novel and find some emotional peace, Rachel moves away to a remote cottage on the Scottish coast. However, she soon starts to see the ghost of her late son, who at one point drags her into the waters and at another point moves a set of magnets on the refrigerator. A local town psychic informs Rachel that the spirit of her son is trying to tell her something, but the rest of the locals warn Rachel that the psychic is just a troubled woman. Troubled by the possibility that her son has returned from the grave, Rachel shares her troubles with a young and handsome lighthouse keeper named Angus (Matheson) and the two spark a romance that suddenly goes awry when she learns that Angus died seven years ago by committing suicide after murdering his wife and her lover in the lighthouse. Rachel fears that she may be going insane and her efforts to prove otherwise, and learn more about the suicide-murder of Angus, falter when the news articles about the tragedy have gone missing from the local library, and Sharon Winton, her best friend and writer for a British tabloid journal, goes missing after Rachel saw her killed by Angus in the lighthouse. It eventually comes to light that her soon to be ex-husband has been having an affair with her best friend, and that they paid a man, Patrick, to pose as Angus in order to cause an already emotionally unstable Rachel to act crazy enough in public that, when they make her murder look like a suicide, no one will suspect foul play. Just as Rachel is about to leave town, convinced that her dead son is trying to warn her that her life is in danger, she is drugged by Sharon and Brian and dumped into the sea, only to be saved when the keys to the chains she has been put into suddenly fall into the water and thus allow her to free herself and make her way to the lighthouse in an effort to seek some revenge. (It was previously written on a slate, \\"don't forget, look behind you\\" and Rachel heard her son repeating those lines in water). However, after a brief fight at the lighthouse, Sharon hits her head and is killed in the kitchen, and Brian is murdered by Patrick, possessed by the spirit of Angus, in much the same way that Angus's wife and lover died seven years previously. Patrick then jumps from the tower, as Angus had done. Rachel leaves town, with the promise that no one will be allowed to access the lighthouse, so that Angus's spirit can finally rest. She returns to her home in London, where her son died, having decided to celebrate his life instead of mourning his death.

1896 poster advertising a tour to other cities (\\"coming soon\\") of Le Chat Noir's troupe of cabaret entertainers Le Chat Noir (; French for \\"The Black Cat\\") was a nineteenth-century entertainment establishment, in the bohemian Montmartre district of Paris. It was opened on 18 November 1881 at 84 Boulevard de Rochechouart by the impresario Rodolphe Salis, and closed in 1897 not long after Salis' death. Le Chat Noir is thought to be the first modern cabaret:\\"Hommage à Salis le Grand\\", in 88 notes pour piano solo, Jean- Pierre Thiollet, Neva Editions, 2015, p. 146. a nightclub where the patrons sat at tables and drank alcoholic beverages while being entertained by a variety show on stage. The acts were introduced by a master of ceremonies who interacted with well-known patrons at the tables. Its imitators have included cabarets from St. Petersburg (Stray Dog Café) to Barcelona (Els Quatre Gats) to London's Cave of the Golden Calf. Perhaps best known now by its iconic Théophile Steinlen poster art, in its heyday it was a bustling nightclub that was part artist salon, part rowdy music hall. From 1882 to 1895 the cabaret published a weekly magazine with the same name, featuring literary writings, news from the cabaret and Montmartre, poetry, and political satire.Cate, Spirit of Montmartre Early history The cabaret began by renting the cheapest accommodations it could find, a small two-room site located at 84 Boulevard Rochechouart, which is now commemorated by a historical plaque. Le Chat Noir Cabaret original location at 84, Boulevard Rochechouart Detail from LE CHAT NOIR journal, number 152, 6 Decembre 1884. Its success was assured with the wholesale arrival of a group of radical young writers and artists called Les Hydropathes (\\"those who are afraid of water – so they drink only wine\\"), a club led by the journalist Émile Goudeau. The group claimed to be averse to water, preferring wine and beer. Their name doubled as a nod to the \\"rabid\\" zeal with which they advocated their sociopolitical and aesthetic agendas. Goudeau's club met in his house on the Rive Gauche (Left Bank), but had become so popular that it outgrew its meeting place. Salis met Goudeau, whom he convinced to relocate the club meeting place across the river on rue de Laval (now rue Victor-Massé).  Second site  Le Chat Noir soon outgrew its first site. In June 1885, three and a half years after opening, it moved to larger accommodations at 12 Rue Victor-Massé. The new venue was the sumptuous old private mansion of the painter Alfred Stevens, who, at Salis' request, transformed it into a \\"fashionable country inn\\" with the help of the architect Maurice Isabey. Soon a growing crowd of poets and singers was gathering at Le Chat Noir, which offered an ideal venue and opportunity to practice their acts before fellow performers, guests and colleagues. With exaggerated, ironic politeness, Salis most often played the role of conférencier (post-performance lecturer, or master of ceremonies). It was here that the Salon des Arts Incohérents (Salon of Incoherent Arts), shadow plays, and comic monologues got their start. Famous men and women to patronize Le Chat Noir included Jane Avril, Franc-Nohain, Adolphe Willette, Caran d'Ache, André Gill, Émile Cohl, Paul Bilhaud, Sarah England, Paul Verlaine, Henri Rivière, Claude Debussy, Erik Satie, Charles Cros, Jules Laforgue, Yvette Guilbert, Charles Moréas, Albert Samain, Louis Le Cardonnel, Coquelin Cadet, Emile Goudeau, Alphonse Allais, Maurice Rollinat, Maurice Donnay, Armand Masson, Aristide Bruant, Théodore Botrel, Paul Signac, Porfirio Pires, August Strindberg, George Auriol, Marie Krysinska, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. The last shadow play by Salis' company was staged in January 1897, after which Salis took the company on tour. Salis was talking of plans to move the cabaret to a location in Paris itself, but he died on 19 March 1897. The death of Rodophe Salis in 1897 spelled the end of Le Chat Noir. By that time the fascination with Montmartre had already diminished, and Salis had already disposed of many of the club's assets and facilities. Soon after Salis' death, the artists dispersed, and Le Chat Noir slowly disappeared.  Last location  Third location of Le Chat Noir at 68 Boulevard de Clichy Paris (image from 1929) Le Chat Noir c.1920 Modern appearance of the last site of Le Chat Noir at 68, Boulevard de Clichy Ten years later, in 1907, Jehan Chargot opened an eponymous café in an effort to resurrect, modernize, and continue the work of his illustrious predecessor. This new Chat Noir, located at 68, boulevard de Clichy, remained popular into the 1920s. Today a neon sign which incorporates Steinlen's iconic Chat Noir image is on display at 68, Boulevard de Clichy, now the site of a hotel by the same name. Other cabarets successfully copied and adapted the model established by Le Chat Noir. In December 1899, Henri Fursy opened his Boîte à Fursy cabaret in the former Chat Noir hotel on rue Victor-Massé. He claimed to have inherited the mantle of Salis, and said his cabaret \\"has thanks to Fursy become once again the goal of all who 'climb Montmartre' to hear their favorite chansonniers (singers)...\\" Shadow play From its opening, Le Chat Noir was thought of as a meeting point for artists, with an interior design in the style of Louis XIII. In the beginning, poets, musicians, writers, and singers performed on the stage, but they were quickly replaced as the shadow play medium developed at Le Chat Noir and spread from there. The cabaret is still remembered for these. The shadow play had already been established in France in the 18th century and made popular by Dominique Séraphin, but it had disappeared from the art world during the 19th century. Le Chat Noir was the major cause of the shadow play's renewed popularity in France, as Lotte Reiniger was in Germany by her linking of such shows to the cinema by creating characters from cutout figures and projecting them as shadow puppets. The birth of the shadow plays in Le Chat Noir took place in a peculiar way. By the end of 1885, the painter Henry Sommer and the illustrator George Auriol built a puppet theater there, intended for adults-only performances. One day Henri Rivière placed a white napkin in front of the opening of the small puppet theater and moved a cardboard puppet behind the white screen with lighting from behind, while Jules Jouy sang, accompanying himself on piano. This was the first shadow play in Le Chat Noir. In 1887 Rivière replaced the puppet theater with a proper shadow theater, with a screen 44 inches high and 55 inches wide, held by a huge frame. Artists such as cartoonist Adolphe Willette, painter Caran d'Ache, Henri Rivière and George Auriol created the cabaret's shadow plays. They used zinc to create the silhouettes of a few characters (although initially they used cardboard), which they used as puppets, projecting their shadow onto a white screen which was illuminated from behind with electric lights. This was an evolutionary development in the art of shadow plays. Writers who frequented the club wrote stories for the shadow theater that Rodolphe Salis, the owner of the cabaret, would read out loud after the performance. Thanks to the collaboration of many of the artists of that time, the stories were accompanied by some very complex colour, sound, and movement effects, making them more dynamic and exciting, as well as piano accompaniment. Over an eleven-year span these plays were presented nightly in the Shadow Theater, totaling more than forty. The Montmartre museum still has a few zinc shapes that had been used in the plays. The spread of this type of show became successful because of Théophile Steinlen's poster announcing \\"la tournée du Chat Noir avec Rodolphe Salis\\", a Shadow Theater tour from Le Chat Noir. Le Chat Noir made many tours with the Shadow Theater. These started in 1892, basically around France during the summer, although Salis and the company went to Tunis, Algeria, and other French-speaking countries such as Belgium. Some of the artists who played in Salis' performances became so famous that they founded their own cabarets or shows. Le Chat Noir was supposed to have its last show and tour in January 1897, since Salis died just after that. However, it was his wife who took the charge of the cabaret and organised other tours. During these shows, Dominique Bonnaud replaced Salis and became the storyteller. Although he did it well, the quality of the performances declined. By then, other establishments had become popular by copying Le Chat noir's techniques, shows and decor. Under the management of Rodolphe Salis, Le Chat noir produced 45 théatre d'ombres (shadow play) shows between 1885 and 1896, as the art became more popular in Europe. Behind a screen on the second floor of the establishment, the artist Henri Rivière worked with up to 20 assistants in a large, oxy-hydrogen backlit performance area and used a double optical lantern to project backgrounds. Originally cardboard cutouts were used, but zinc figures took their place after 1887. Various artists took part in the creation, including Steinlen, Adolphe Willette and Albert Robida. Caran d'Ache designed around 50 cutouts for the very popular 1888 show L'Epopée.

They occur in Malesia, New Guinea and Australia. In Australia, they are a well-known rainforest species known by their Indigenous Australian name, booyong or the tulip oak. Argyrodendron has often been treated as a synonym of Heritiera, but a recent molecular study shows it to be distinct therefrom.Wilkie et al. Phylogenetic Relationships within the Subfamily Sterculioideae (Malvaceae/Sterculiaceae-Sterculieae) Using the Chloroplast Gene ndhF. Syst. Bot. 31(1): 160-170 (2006). In their native habitat, they can grow tall, 40–60 metres, but rarely reach this in cultivation. The bases of large trees are usually prominently buttressed. Leaves with white or silver on underside. Argyrodendron actinophyllum and Argyrodendron trifoliolatum occur in scrubs and rainforests along the east coast of Australia, but Argyrodendron peralatum has a restricted distribution in north Queensland between Tully and Cooktown.

Neville Brody is an alumnus of the London College of Communication and Hornsey College of Art, and is known for his work on The Face magazine (1981–1986), Arena magazine (1987–1990), as well as for designing record covers for artists such as Clock DVA, Cabaret Voltaire, The Bongos, and Depeche Mode. He created the company Research Studios in 1994 and is a founding member of Fontworks. His work is included in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).Fonts: 23 New Faces in MoMA’s Collection He was the Dean of the School of Communication at the Royal College of Art, London until September 2018. Early life and education Brody was born in Southgate, London. He attended Minchenden Grammar School and studied A-Level Art, very much from a fine art viewpoint. In 1975 Brody went on to do a Fine Art foundation course at Hornsey College of Art. In Autumn 1976, Brody started a three-year B.A. course in graphics at the London College of Printing. His work was influenced by the emergence of punk rock in London life. He designed posters for student concerts at the college, most notably for Pere Ubu, supported by The Human League. His first-year thesis was based around a comparison between Dadaism and pop art. 1980s: Art Direction Brody's experimentation with his self-made sans-serif typography, along with his Pop Art and Dadaism influence, caught the attention of music record companies such as Fetish Records and Stiff records after he left college. His record cover designs lead toward a grudgy and a punk scene. The album Micro- Phonies by Cabaret Voltaire was art directed by Brody in 1984. His infamous typography features on the front and a bandaged figure spouting liquid from the mouth stares blankly at the viewer. Brody made his name largely popular through his work as art director for The Face. He changed the \\"basic\\" and \\"structural\\" rules that existed in the British culture into a more artsy and vibrant aesthetic. His designs provoked some form of emotion to the extent that people would stick to one page instead of turning pages like they would normally do when reading a novel. Other international magazine and newspaper directions have included City Limits, Lei, Per Lui, Actuel and Arena, together with the radical new look for two leading British newspapers The Guardian and The Observer (both newspaper and magazine). In 1988 Thames & Hudson published the first of two volumes about his work, which became the world's best selling graphic design book. Combined sales now exceed 120,000. An accompanying exhibition of his work at the Victoria and Albert Museum attracted over 40,000 visitors before touring Europe and Japan. Amongst countless other projects, in 1989, upon request by the then-director Gerhard Coenen, to Neville Brody, the young Swiss graphic artist and typeface designer Cornel Windlin, then working at the then called \\"Neville Brody Studio\\" designed the Corporate Identity for the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (House of World Cultures) in Berlin, Germany. Subsequently, Brody, Windlin, and staff Simon Staines, Giles Dunn and others visited Berlin more than once on projects; resulting in several collaborations with Berlin-based graphic artist and typeface-designer Kolja Gruber and artist Nina Fischer for the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in the following years. Business and Typography In 1991, Neville Brody and Jon Wozencroft created the FUSE project. FUSE is an interactive magazine that sets out to challenge our current ideas about typographic and visual language in an age of ever changing communications technology and media. Brody was also partly responsible for instigating the fusion between a magazine, graphics design and typeface design. The magazine ranges in themes from \\"Codes\\" and \\"Runes\\" to \\"Religion\\" and \\"Pornography.\\" the exploration and freedom that the publishers exhibit is undeniable and exciting. The conventions upturned in FUSE are prescient in their definition of new standards. Each package includes a publication with articles relating to typography and surrounding subjects, four brand new fonts that are unique and revolutionary in some shape or form and four posters designed by the type designer usually using little more than their included font. In 1990 he also founded the FontFont typeface library together with Erik Spiekermann. Notable fonts include the updated font for the Times newspaper, Times Modern, New Deal as used in publicity material and titles for the film Public Enemies and Industria. 1994-Present Neville Brody still also continues to work as a graphic designer and together with business partner Fwa Richards launched his own design practice, Research Studios, in London in 1994. Since then studios have been opened in Paris, Berlin and Barcelona. The company is best known for its ability to create new visual languages for a variety of applications ranging from publishing to film. It also creates packaging and website design, corporate identity for clients, and on-screen graphics. Recent projects include the redesign of the BBC in September 2011, The Times in November 2006 with the creation of a new font Times Modern. The typeface shares many visual similarities with Mercury designed by Jonathan Hoefler. It is the first new font at the newspaper since it introduced Times New Roman in 1932. The company also completed a visual identity project for the Paris contemporary art exhibition Nuit Blanche in 2006. Brody's team launched a new look for the champagne brand Dom Pérignon in February 2007, having been appointed in 2004 to help the brand with its strategy and repositioning. A sister company, Research Publishing, produces and publishes experimental multi-media works by young artists. The primary focus is on FUSE, the conference and quarterly forum for experimental typography and communications. The publication is approaching its 20th issue over a publishing period of over ten years. Three FUSE conferences have so far been held, in London, San Francisco and Berlin. The conferences bring together speakers from design, architecture, sound, film and interactive design and web. As of 2017, the Welsh WJEC exam board included Neville Brody as part of their Graphic Design curriculum.

The ABS is one of several short line railroads owned by Watco Companies. The railroad operates an line leased from the Kansas City Southern Railway. It began operating in 2005. History The Alabama Southern's line is composed of three Kansas City Southern branch lines totaling : the Tuscaloosa Subdivision (Columbus–Tuscaloosa), the Warrior Branch (Tuscaloosa–Fox, Alabama), and the Brookwood Branch (Brookwood, Alabama–Brookwood Junction). The line runs between Columbus and Brookwood, with trackage rights over the Kansas City Southern from Columbus to Artesia, Mississippi. The line was originally constructed by the Mobile and Ohio Railroad which was purchased through a foreclosure sale by the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad (GM&O;) on August 1, 1940. The GM&O; merged with the Illinois Central on August 10, 1972, resulting in the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad. On March 31, 1986, the MidSouth Rail Corp. purchased of track, which included this line, from the Illinois Central Gulf. On January 1, 1994, the Kansas City Southern bought out Midsouth Rail. The railroad began operating on November 20, 2005. The railroad interchanges with the KCS at Artesia, CSX Transportation in Brookwood, and the Norfolk Southern Railway in Tuscaloosa.

Such biogeochemical cycles are important in geology because they affect many minerals. Biochemical cycles are also important for life because sulfur is an essential element, being a constituent of many proteins and cofactors, and sulfur compounds can be used as oxidants or reductants in microbial respiration. The global sulfur cycle involves the transformations of sulfur species through different oxidation states, which play an important role in both geological and biological processes. The Sulfur cycle (in general) Sulfur cycle Steps of the sulfur cycle are: * Mineralization of organic sulfur into inorganic forms, such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), elemental sulfur, as well as sulfide minerals. * Oxidation of hydrogen sulfide, sulfide, and elemental sulfur (S) to sulfate (SO42−). * Reduction of sulfate to sulfide. * Incorporation of sulfide into organic compounds (including metal-containing derivatives). Structure of 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate, a key intermediate in the sulfur cycle. These are often termed as follows: :Assimilative sulfate reduction (see also sulfur assimilation) in which sulfate (SO42−) is reduced by plants, fungi and various prokaryotes. The oxidation states of sulfur are +6 in sulfate and –2 in R–SH. :Desulfurization in which organic molecules containing sulfur can be desulfurized, producing hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S, oxidation state = –2). An analogous process for organic nitrogen compounds is deamination. :Oxidation of hydrogen sulfide produces elemental sulfur (S8), oxidation state = 0. This reaction occurs in the photosynthetic green and purple sulfur bacteria and some chemolithotrophs. Often the elemental sulfur is stored as polysulfides. :Oxidation in elemental sulfur by sulfur oxidizers produces sulfate. :Dissimilative sulfur reduction in which elemental sulfur can be reduced to hydrogen sulfide. :Dissimilative sulfate reduction in which sulfate reducers generate hydrogen sulfide from sulfate.  Sulfur oxidation state  Sulfur has four main oxidation states in nature, which are -2, +2, +4, and +6. The common sulfur species of each oxidation state are listed as follows: S2-: H2S, FeS, FeS2, CuS S0: native, or elemental, sulfur S2+: SO S4+: SO2, sulfite (SO32-) S6+: SO42- (H2SO4, CaSO4), SF6 Sulfur sources and sinks Sulfur is found in oxidation states ranging from +6 in SO42− to -2 in sulfides. Thus, elemental sulfur can either give or receive electrons depending on its environment. On the anoxic early Earth, most sulfur was present in minerals such as pyrite (FeS2). Over Earth history, the amount of mobile sulfur increased through volcanic activity as well as weathering of the crust in an oxygenated atmosphere. Earth's main sulfur sink is the oceans SO42−, where it is the major oxidizing agent. When SO42− is assimilated by organisms, it is reduced and converted to organic sulfur, which is an essential component of proteins. However, the biosphere does not act as a major sink for sulfur, instead the majority of sulfur is found in seawater or sedimentary rocks including: pyrite rich shales, evaporite rocks (anhydrite and baryte), and calcium and magnesium carbonates (i.e. carbonate-associated sulfate). The amount of sulfate in the oceans is controlled by three major processes:Alexandra V. Turchyn \\"Oxygen isotopes in marine sulfate and the sulfur cycle over the last 140 million years\\" Harvard University, 2005. :1. input from rivers :2. sulfate reduction and sulfide re-oxidation on continental shelves and slopes :3. burial of anhydrite and pyrite in the oceanic crust. The primary natural source of sulfur to the atmosphere is sea spray or windblown sulfur rich dust, neither of which is long lived in the atmosphere. In recent times, the large annual input of sulfur from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels has added a substantial amount SO2 which acts as an air pollutant. In the geologic past, igneous intrusions into coal measures have caused large scale burning of these measures, and consequential release of sulfur to the atmosphere. This has led to substantial disruption to the climate system, and is one of the proposed causes of the Permian–Triassic extinction event. Dimethylsulfide [(CH3)2S or DMS] is produced by the decomposition of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) from dying phytoplankton cells in the ocean's photic zone, and is the major biogenic gas emitted from the sea, where it is responsible for the distinctive “smell of the sea” along coastlines. DMS is the largest natural source of sulfur gas, but still only has a residence time of about one day in the atmosphere and a majority of it is redeposited in the oceans rather than making it to land. However, it is a significant factor in the climate system, as it is involved in the formation of clouds. Biologically and thermochemically driven sulfate reduction Dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway Through the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway, sulfate can be reduced either bacterially (bacterial sulfate reduction) or inorganically (thermochemical sulfate reduction). This pathway involves the reduction of sulfate by organic compounds to produce hydrogen sulfide, which occurs in both processes. The main products and reactants of bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) and thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) are very similar. For both, various organic compounds and dissolved sulfate are the reactants, and the products or by-products are as follows: H2S, CO2, carbonates, elemental sulfur and metal sulfides. However, the reactive organic compounds differ for BSR and TSR because of the mutually exclusive temperature regimes. Organic acids are the main organic reactants for BSR and branched/n-alkanes are the main organic reactants for TSR. The inorganic reaction products in BSR and TSR are H2S(HS−) and HCO3− (CO2). These processes occur because there are two very different thermal regimes in which sulfate is reduced, particularly in low-temperature and high-temperature environments. BSR usually occurs at lower temperatures from 0-80 °C, while TSR happens at much higher temperatures around 100–140 °C. Temperatures for TSR are not as well defined; the lowest confirmed temperature is 127 °C and the highest temperatures occur in settings around 160-180 °C. These two different regimes appear because at higher temperatures most sulfate-reducing microbes can no longer metabolize due to the denaturation of proteins or deactivation of enzymes, so TSR takes over. However, in hot sediments around hydrothermal vents BSR can happen at temperatures up to 110 °C. BSR and TSR occur at different depths. BSR takes place in low-temperature environments, which are shallower settings such as oil and gas fields. BSR can also take place in modern marine sedimentary environments such as stratified inland seas, continental shelves, organic-rich deltas, and hydrothermal sediments which have intense microbial sulfate reduction because of the high concentration of dissolved sulfate in the seawater. Additionally, the high amounts of hydrogen sulfide found in oil in gas fields is thought to arise from the oxidation of petroleum hydrocarbons by sulfate. Such reactions are known to occur by microbial processes but it is generally accepted that TSR is responsible for the bulk of these reactions, especially in deep or hot reservoirs. Thus, TSR occurs in deep reservoirs where the temperatures are much higher. BSR is geologically instantaneous in most geologic settings, while TSR occurs at rates in the order of hundreds of thousands of years. Although much slower than BSR, even TSR appears to be a geologically fairly fast process. BSR in shallow environments and TSR in deep reservoirs are key processes in the oceanic sulfur cycle. Approximately, 10% (of the total gas) of H2S is produced in BSR settings, whereas 90% of the H2S is produced in TSR settings. If there is more than a few percent of H2S in any deep reservoir, then it is assumed that TSR has taken over. This is due to the fact that thermal cracking of hydrocarbons doesn't provide more than a couple percent of H2S. The amount of H2S is affected by several factors such as, the availability of organic reactants and sulfate and the presence/availability of base and transition metals.  Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in hydrothermal vents  Hydrothermal vents emit hydrogen sulfide that support the carbon fixation of chemolithotrophic bacteria that oxidize hydrogen sulfide with oxygen to produce elemental sulfur or sulfate. The chemical reactions are as follows: CO2 \\\\+ 4H2S + O2 -> CH2O + 4S0 \\\\+ 3H2O CO2 \\\\+ H2S + O2 \\\\+ H2O -> CH2O + SO42- \\\\+ 2H+ In modern oceans, Thiomicrospira, Halothiobacillus, and Beggiatoa are primary sulfur oxidizing bacteria, and form chemosynthetic symbioses with animal hosts. The host provides metabolic substrates (e.g., CO2, O2, H2O) to the symbiont while the symbiont generates organic carbon for sustaining the metabolic activities of the host. The produced sulfate usually combines with the leached calcium ions to form gypsum, which can form widespread deposits on near mid-ocean spreading centers. δ34S Although 25 isotopes are known for sulfur, only four are stable and of geochemical importance. Of those four, two (32S, light and 34S, heavy) comprise (99.22%) of S on Earth. The vast majority (95.02%) of S occurs as 32S with only 4.21% in 34S. The ratio of these two isotopes is fixed in our solar system and has been since its formation. The bulk Earth sulfur isotopic ratio is thought to be the same as the ratio of 22.22 measured from the Canyon Diablo troilite (CDT), a meteorite. That ratio is accepted as the international standard and is therefore set at δ0.00. Deviation from 0.00 is expressed as the δ34S which is a ratio in per mill (‰). Positive values correlate to increased levels of 34S, whereas negative values correlate with greater 32S in a sample. Formation of sulfur minerals through non-biogenic processes does not substantially differentiate between the light and heavy isotopes, therefore sulfur isotope ratios in gypsum or barite should be the same as the overall isotope ratio in the water column at their time of precipitation. Sulfate reduction through biologic activity strongly differentiates between the two isotopes because of the more rapid enzymic reaction with 32S. Sulfate metabolism results in an isotopic depletion of -18‰, and repeated cycles of oxidation and reduction can result in values up to -50 ‰. Average present day seawater values of δ34S are on the order of +21‰. Throughout geologic history the sulfur cycle and the isotopic ratios have coevolved with the biosphere becoming overall more negative with the increases in biologically driven sulfate reduction, but also show substantial positive excursion. In general positive excursions in the sulfur isotopes mean that there is an excess of pyrite deposition rather than oxidation of sulfide minerals exposed on land.  Marine sulfur cycle  The sulfur cycle in marine environments has been well-studied via the tool of sulfur isotope systematics expressed as δ34S. The modern global oceans have sulfur storage of 1.3 × 1021 g, mainly occurring as sulfate with the δ34S value of +21‰. The overall input flux is 1.0 × 1014 g/year with the sulfur isotope composition of ~3‰. Riverine sulfate derived from the terrestrial weathering of sulfide minerals (δ34S = +6‰) is the primary input of sulfur to the oceans. Other sources are metamorphic and volcanic degassing and hydrothermal activity (δ34S = 0‰), which release reduced sulfur species (e.g., H2S and S0). There are two major outputs of sulfur from the oceans. The first sink is the burial of sulfate either as marine evaporites (e.g., gypsum) or carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS), which accounts for 6 × 1013 g/year (δ34S = +21‰). The second sulfur sink is pyrite burial in shelf sediments or deep seafloor sediments (4 × 1013 g/year; δ34S = -20‰). The total marine sulfur output flux is 1.0 × 1014 g/year which matches the input fluxes, implying the modern marine sulfur budget is at steady state. The residence time of sulfur in modern global oceans is 13,000,000 years. Evolution of the sulfur cycle The isotopic composition of sedimentary sulfides provides primary information on the evolution of the sulfur cycle. The total inventory of sulfur compounds on the surface of the Earth (nearly S) represents the total outgassing of sulfur through geologic time. Rocks analyzed for sulfur content are generally organic-rich shales meaning they are likely controlled by biogenic sulfur reduction. Average seawater curves are generated from evaporites deposited throughout geologic time because again, since they do not discriminate between the heavy and light sulfur isotopes, they should mimic the ocean composition at the time of deposition. 4.6 billion years ago (Ga) the Earth formed and had a theoretical δ34S value of 0. Since there was no biologic activity on early Earth there would be no isotopic fractionation. All sulfur in the atmosphere would be released during volcanic eruptions. When the oceans condensed on Earth, the atmosphere was essentially swept clean of sulfur gases, owing to their high solubility in water. Throughout the majority of the Archean (4.6–2.5 Ga) most systems appeared to be sulfate-limited. Some small Archean evaporite deposits require that at least locally elevated concentrations (possibly due to local volcanic activity) of sulfate existed in order for them to be supersaturated and precipitate out of solution. 3.8–3.6 Ga marks the beginning of the exposed geologic record because this is the age of the oldest rocks on Earth. Metasedimentary rocks from this time still have an isotopic value of 0 because the biosphere was not developed enough (possibly at all) to fractionate sulfur. 3.5 Ga anoxyogenic photosynthesis is established and provides a weak source of sulfate to the global ocean with sulfate concentrations incredibly low the δ34S is still basically 0. Shortly after, at 3.4 Ga the first evidence for minimal fractionation in evaporitic sulfate in association with magmatically derived sulfides can be seen in the rock record. This fractionation shows possible evidence for anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria. 2.8 Ga marks the first evidence for oxygen production through photosynthesis. This is important because there cannot be sulfur oxidation without oxygen in the atmosphere. This exemplifies the coevolution of the oxygen and sulfur cycles as well as the biosphere. 2.7–2.5 Ga is the age of the oldest sedimentary rocks to have a depleted δ 34S which provide the first compelling evidence for sulfate reduction. 2.3 Ga sulfate increases to more than 1 mM; this increase in sulfate is coincident with the \\"Great Oxygenation Event\\", when redox conditions on Earth's surface are thought by most workers to have shifted fundamentally from reducing to oxidizing. This shift would have led to an incredible increase in sulfate weathering which would have led to an increase in sulfate in the oceans. The large isotopic fractionations that would likely be associated with bacteria reduction are produced for the first time. Although there was a distinct rise in seawater sulfate at this time it was likely still only less than 5–15% of present-day levels. At 1.8 Ga, Banded iron formations (BIF) are common sedimentary rocks throughout the Archean and Paleoproterozoic; their disappearance marks a distinct shift in the chemistry of ocean water. BIFs have alternating layers of iron oxides and chert. BIFs only form if the water is allowed to supersaturate in dissolved iron (Fe2+) meaning there cannot be free oxygen or sulfur in the water column because it would form Fe3+ (rust) or pyrite and precipitate out of solution. Following this supersaturation, the water must become oxygenated in order for the ferric rich bands to precipitate it must still be sulfur poor otherwise pyrite would form instead of Fe3+. It has been hypothesized that BIFs formed during the initial evolution of photosynthetic organisms that had phases of population growth, causing over production of oxygen. Due to this over production they would poison themselves causing a mass die off, which would cut off the source of oxygen and produce a large amount of CO2 through the decomposition of their bodies, allowing for another bacterial bloom. After 1.8 Ga sulfate concentrations were sufficient to increase rates of sulfate reduction to greater than the delivery flux of iron to the oceans. Along with the disappearance of BIF, the end of the Paleoproterozoic also marks the first large scale sedimentary exhalative deposits showing a link between mineralization and a likely increase in the amount of sulfate in sea water. In the Paleoproterozoic the sulfate in seawater had increased to an amount greater than in the Archean, but was still lower than present day values. The sulfate levels in the Proterozoic also act as proxies for atmospheric oxygen because sulfate is produced mostly through weathering of the continents in the presence of oxygen. The low levels in the Proterozoic simply imply that levels of atmospheric oxygen fell between the abundances of the Phanerozoic and the deficiencies of the Archean. 750 million years ago (Ma) there is a renewed deposition of BIF which marks a significant change in ocean chemistry. This was likely due to snowball earth episodes where the entire globe including the oceans was covered in a layer of ice cutting off oxygenation. In the late Neoproterozoic high carbon burial rates increased the atmospheric oxygen level to >10% of its present-day value. In the Latest Neoproterozoic another major oxidizing event occurred on Earth's surface that resulted in an oxic deep ocean and possibly allowed for the appearance of multicellular life. During the last 600 million years, seawater SO4 has generally varied between +10 and +30‰ in δ34S, with an average value close to that of today. Notably changes in seawater δ34S occurred during extinction and climatic events during this time. Over a shorter time scale (ten million years) changes in the sulfur cycle are easier to observe and can be even better constrained with oxygen isotopes. Oxygen is continually incorporated into the sulfur cycle through sulfate oxidation and then released when that sulfate is reduced once again. Since different sulfate sources within the ocean have distinct oxygen isotopic values it may be possible to use oxygen to trace the sulfur cycle. Biological sulfate reduction preferentially selects lighter oxygen isotopes for the same reason that lighter sulfur isotopes are preferred. By studying oxygen isotopes in ocean sediments over the last 10 million years Tychyn et al. (2004) incomplete ref were able to better constrain the sulfur concentrations in sea water through that same time. They found that the sea level changes due to Pliocene and Pleistocene glacial cycles changed the area of continental shelves which then disrupted the sulfur processing, lowering the concentration of sulfate in the sea water. This was a drastic change as compared to preglacial times before 2 million years ago.  The Great Oxidation Event and sulfur isotope mass-independent fractionation  The Great Oxygenation Event (GOE) is characterized by the disappearance of sulfur isotope mass-independent fractionation (MIF) in the sedimentary records at around 2.45 billion years ago (Ga). The MIF of sulfur isotope (Δ33S) is defined by the deviation of measured δ33S value from the δ33S value inferred from the measured δ34S value according to the mass dependent fractionation law. The Great Oxidation Event represented a massive transition of global sulfur cycles. Before the Great Oxidation Event, the sulfur cycle was heavily influenced by the ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the associated photochemical reactions, which induced the sulfur isotope mass-independent fractionation (Δ33S ≠ 0). The preservation of sulfur isotope mass-independent fractionation signals requires the atmospheric O2 lower than 10−5 of present atmospheric level (PAL). The disappearance of sulfur isotope mass-independent fractionation at ~2.45 Ga indicates that atmospheric pO2 exceeded 10−5 present atmospheric level after the Great Oxygenation Event. Oxygen played an essential role in the global sulfur cycles after the Great Oxygenation Event, such as oxidative weathering of sulfides. The burial of pyrite in sediments in turn contributes to the accumulation of free O2 in Earth's surface environment. Economic importance Sulfur is intimately involved in production of fossil fuels and a majority of metal deposits because of its ability to act as an oxidizing or reducing agent. The vast majority of the major mineral deposits on Earth contain a substantial amount of sulfur including, but not limited to: sedimentary exhalative deposits (SEDEX), Carbonate-hosted lead-zinc ore deposits (Mississippi Valley- Type MVT) and porphyry copper deposits. Iron sulfides, galena and sphalerite will form as by-products of hydrogen sulfide generation, as long as the respective transition or base metals are present or transported to a sulfate reduction site. If the system runs out of reactive hydrocarbons economically viable elemental sulfur deposits may form. Sulfur also acts as a reducing agent in many natural gas reservoirs and generally ore forming fluids have a close relationship with ancient hydrocarbon seeps or vents. Important sources of sulfur in ore deposits are generally deep-seated, but they can also come from local country rocks, sea water, or marine evaporites. The presence or absence of sulfur is one of the limiting factors on both the concentration of precious metals and its precipitation from solution. pH, temperature and especially redox states determine whether sulfides will precipitate. Most sulfide brines will remain in concentration until they reach reducing conditions, a higher pH or lower temperatures. Ore fluids are generally linked to metal rich waters that have been heated within a sedimentary basin under the elevated thermal conditions typically in extensional tectonic settings. The redox conditions of the basin lithologies exert an important control on the redox state of the metal-transporting fluids and deposits can form from both oxidizing and reducing fluids. Metal-rich ore fluids tend to be by necessity comparatively sulfide deficient, so a substantial portion of the sulfide must be supplied from another source at the site of mineralization. Bacterial reduction of seawater sulfate or a euxinic (anoxic and H2S-containing) water column is a necessary source of that sulfide. When present, the δ34S values of barite are generally consistent with a seawater sulfate source, suggesting baryte formation by reaction between hydrothermal barium and sulfate in ambient seawater. Once fossil fuels or precious metals are discovered and either burned or milled, the sulfur become a waste product which must be dealt with properly or it can become a pollutant. There has been a great increase in the amount of sulfur in our present day atmosphere because of the burning of fossil fuels. Sulfur acts as a pollutant and an economic resource at the same time. Human impact Human activities have a major effect on the global sulfur cycle. The burning of coal, natural gas, and other fossil fuels has greatly increased the amount of S in the atmosphere and ocean and depleted the sedimentary rock sink. Without human impact sulfur would stay tied up in rocks for millions of years until it was uplifted through tectonic events and then released through erosion and weathering processes. Instead it is being drilled, pumped and burned at a steadily increasing rate. Over the most polluted areas there has been a 30-fold increase in sulfate deposition. Although the sulfur curve shows shifts between net sulfur oxidation and net sulfur reduction in the geologic past, the magnitude of the current human impact is probably unprecedented in the geologic record. Human activities greatly increase the flux of sulfur to the atmosphere, some of which is transported globally. Humans are mining coal and extracting petroleum from the Earth's crust at a rate that mobilizes 150 x 1012 gS/yr, which is more than double the rate of 100 years ago. The result of human impact on these processes is to increase the pool of oxidized sulfur (SO4) in the global cycle, at the expense of the storage of reduced sulfur in the Earth's crust. Therefore, human activities do not cause a major change in the global pools of S, but they do produce massive changes in the annual flux of S through the atmosphere. When SO2 is emitted as an air pollutant, it forms sulfuric acid through reactions with water in the atmosphere. Once the acid is completely dissociated in water the pH can drop to 4.3 or lower causing damage to both man-made and natural systems. According to the EPA, acid rain is a broad term referring to a mixture of wet and dry deposition (deposited material) from the atmosphere containing higher than normal amounts of nitric and sulfuric acids. Distilled water (water without any dissolved constituents), which contains no carbon dioxide, has a neutral pH of 7. Rain naturally has a slightly acidic pH of 5.6, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid, a very weak acid. Around Washington, D.C., however, the average rain pH is between 4.2 and 4.4. Since pH is on a log scale dropping by 1 (the difference between normal rain water and acid rain) has a dramatic effect on the strength of the acid. In the United States, roughly 2/3 of all SO2 and 1/4 of all NO3 come from electric power generation that relies on burning fossil fuels, like coal. As it is an important nutrient for plants, sulfur is increasingly used as a component of fertilizers. Recently sulfur deficiency has become widespread in many countries in Europe. Because of actions taken to limit acid rains atmospheric inputs of sulfur continue to decrease, As a result the deficit in the sulfur input is likely to increase unless sulfur fertilizers are used.Sulfur as a fertilizer.

Personal life He was born in Christiania a son of judge Edvard Omsen Heiberg (1829–1884) and his wife Minna (Vilhelmine) Rode (8 June 1836 – 1917). He was a brother of Jacob, Anton and Inge Heiberg, as well as an uncle of Hans Heiberg, first cousin of Eivind Heiberg, Gustav Adolf Lammers Heiberg Helge Rode and Kristofer Hansteen, a first cousin once removed of Bernt, Axel and Edvard Heiberg and a second cousin of Jean Heiberg. He was married to actress Didrikke Tollefsen (1863–1915), whom he met in Bergen, between 1 April 1885 and 1896. On 15 April 1911 he married Birgit Friis Stoltz Blehr (1880–1933). Through his second wife's sister he was a brother-in-law of Sigurd Bødtker. Career Heiberg finished his secondary education in 1874, and enrolled in law studies. Having befriended Gerhard Gran, he came under the influence of Charles Darwin, Georg Brandes and Johan Sverdrup. He became a cultural radical, and made his debut as a poet in 1878. In the autumn that year he spent time in Rome, together with Henrik Ibsen and Jens Peter Jacobsen. His first play Tante Ulrikke was written from 1877, finally printed in 1884, but not staged until 1901. His first play to reach the stage was Kong Midas, premiéring in Copenhagen's Royal Danish Theatre in 1890. From 1880 to 1882 he worked as a journalist in Dagbladet. He was subsequently a journalist in Verdens Gang from 1896 to 1903, and Paris correspondent for that newspaper from 1897 to 1901 (during the Dreyfus case, among others). He was also a theatre critic. From 1884 to 1888, he was the artistic director of the theatre Den Nationale Scene in Bergen. He resigned when the theatre director and board refused to stage Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson's play Kongen. His best-known plays are Balkonen (The Balcony, 1894) and Kjærlighedens Tragedie (The Tragedy of Love, 1904). =Anti-Swedish sentiments= Heiberg was hostile to Oscar II, King in the personal union between Sweden and Norway. In 1896 he wrote the book Hs. Majestæt, originally published as a series of articles in Verdens Gang. The book was highly critical towards Oscar II, stemming from a news story that the King, when processioning in Støren, had personally knocked the hat off a farmer's head. When the book was printed, the publishing company Olaf Norlis Forlag did not dare to put its name on the cover page. Not long after, the publishing house was threatened with legal steps. Nearly all of the 1,100 copies were annihilated in self-censorship. In 1905 Heiberg stood forward as an agitator for the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden. At the 16 January 1905 première of Kjærlighedens Tragedie Heiberg held a speech against the union, stating that a peaceful continuation of the present conditions between Sweden and Norway was impossible. Heiberg was adamant that the only acceptable solution would be a free and independent Norwegian state, and that no compromise could be made in that regard. Present at the event was the former (1900–1902) Liberal Party of Norway Minister of Defence Georg Stang, whom Heiberg greatly admired for his work on the construction of many of the defensive fortifications along the Norwegian–Swedish border. After the completion of his speech Heiberg walked across the room to where Colonel Stang was seated, toasted him, put his arm around Stang's neck and exclaimed: \\"I love you\\". The dissolution went through, but Heiberg also opposed the Karlstad Treaty, the conditions of which he found \\"humiliating\\".Norland 2004: 238 One of Heiberg's main points of contention with the Karlstad Treaty was the Norwegian acceptance to dismantle the border fortifications, writing in Dagbladet 13 September 1905 that \\"an honourable war is far less dank and sickening than a dishonourable peace\\".Norland 2004: 230–231 Norland 2004: 230 Also, as a republican he did not want a new monarchy to ascend the throne; this happened following the Norwegian monarchy plebiscite, 1905. Collected speeches about all these topics were published in 1923 under the title 1905. In 1912 Heiberg attacked Christian Michelsen, a republican who worked to dissolve the union but advocated monarchy, in the play Jeg vil værge mit land. (I will/want to defend my country) From 1923 he received a writer's grant from the state. He died in November 1929 in Oslo, and is buried at Vestre gravlund.

It was founded in the wake of Pauline Hanson's One Nation experiencing severe ructions in Queensland, the home state of founder Pauline Hanson. One Nation had made a surprisingly good showing at the 1998 state election, winning 11 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. However, in 1999, five MLAs seceded to sit as independents, in protest at the centralisation of party affairs in Sydney, costing One Nation official status in the legislature. Amid delays in the Supreme Court of Queensland acting on an appeal of One Nation's deregistration in Queensland, the five remaining One Nation MLAs tried to register a separate Queensland party. When party headquarters declared it a mutiny, they announced formation of One Nation QLD as a separate party. The party later changed its name to the City Country Alliance. Its inaugural parliamentary leader was Bill Feldman, and its executive director was Ian Petersen. A sixth member, Jeff Knuth, subsequently joined, and was later followed by former Senator-elect Heather Hill. On 12 September 2000, the party became lawfully registered, but it had already showed signs of collapse before winning formal registration. Its website had not been updated since 24 March 2000. On 17 February 2001, the party contested the Queensland state election, winning only 2.39% of the primary vote, and losing all of its seats. On 22 April 2003, the party lost its official status after the Australian Electoral Commission determined it no longer had the right to hold it.

In some places, these stretches are punctuated by whitewater, while at others the water flow is smoother, but still shallow.  The Six Cataracts Counted going upstream (from north to south): In Egypt: *The First Cataract cuts through Aswan (). Its former location was selected for the construction of Aswan Low Dam, the first dam built across the Nile. In Sudan: *The Second Cataract (or Great Cataract) was in Nubia and is now submerged under Lake Nasser. () *The Third Cataract is at Tombos/Hannek. () *The Fourth Cataract is in the Manasir Desert, and since 2008, is submerged under the reservoir of Merowe Dam. () *The Fifth Cataract is near the confluence of the Nile and Atbarah Rivers. () *The Sixth Cataract is where the Nile cuts through the Sabaluka pluton, close to Bagrawiyah. () Geology Geologists indicate that the region of the northern Sudan is tectonically active and this activity has caused the river to take on \\"youthful\\" characteristics. The Nubian Swell has diverted the river's course to the west, while keeping its depth shallow and causing the formation of the cataracts. Even as the river bed is worn down by erosion, the land mass is lifted, keeping parts of the river bed exposed. These distinctive features of the river between Aswan and Khartoum have led to the stretch being often referred to as the Cataract Nile, while the downstream portion is occasionally referred to as the \\"Egyptian\\" Nile. The geological distinction between these two portions of the river is considerable. North of Aswan, the river bed is not rocky, but is instead composed of sediment, and far from being a shallow river. It is believed that the bedrock was previously eroded to be several thousand feet deep. This created a vast canyon that is now filled by the sediment. Despite these characteristics, some of the cataracts which are normally impassable by boat because of the shallow water have become navigable during the flood season. History The word cataract is a Greek word καταρρέω (\\"to flow down\\") although the original Greek term was the plural-only Κατάδουποι. However, none of the Nile's six primary cataracts could be accurately described as waterfalls, and given a broader definition, this is the same with many of the minor cataracts. In ancient times, Upper Egypt extended from south of the Nile Delta to the first cataract, while further upstream, the land was controlled by the ancient Kingdom of Kush that would later take over Egypt from 760 to 656 BC. Eratosthenes gave a precise description of the Cataract-Nile: The six cataracts of the Nile are depicted extensively by European visitors, notably by Winston Churchill in The River War (1899), where he recounts the exploits of the British trying to return to the Sudan between 1896 and 1898, after they were forced to leave in 1885.

Location Arenig Fawr is the highest member of the Arenig range, with Arenig Fach (), a smaller neighbouring mountain, lying to the north. It is surrounded by Moel Llyfnant to the west, Rhobell Fawr to the south and Mynydd Nodol to the east. Ascent The easy-to-moderate climb to the summit takes about 2½ hours from Llyn Celyn. There are no readily identifiable footpaths but the route is marked by an old wire boundary fence. Beneath the mountain is Llyn Arenig Fawr, a reservoir providing drinking water to Bala and the surrounding villages. The summit, which is also known as Moel yr Eglwys (), has a trig point and a memorial to eight American aircrew who died when their Flying Fortress bomber B-17F #42-3124 crashed on 4 August 1943. Some of the crash wreckage is still scattered across the hillside 300 m (330 yds) from the memorial location. From the summit, with good weather conditions, it is possible to see several notable Welsh mountain ranges: the Rhinogs in the west, Snowdon to the northwest, the Clwydian Hills in the northeast, east to the Berwyns, south east to the Arans, and southward to Cadair Idris. It is one of the finest panoramas in Wales. In exceptional conditions the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland, the Blackpool Tower, summits of the Peak District above Manchester, the Lake District, and the Brecon Beacons can also be seen.

The parish has a population of 551. It is in the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), within the Green Belt and is in a conservation area. The village of Freshford includes the smaller hamlets of Friary, Sharpstone, Park Corner, Woodside and Staples Hill, which are separated from the village centre by a few hundred metres of open fields. The village history goes back to Saxon times and it expanded with the growth of local industry but is now largely residential. History The village has existed since Saxon times, and existed before the land at Fersceforde was given to Bath Abbey after the Norman Conquest. A mill existed here as early as 1086 and there are still remains of one built in the 1540s. Freshford was part of the hundred of Bath Forum. Freshford Bridge over the River Frome dates from the early to mid 16th century. In the 19th century freestone and fuller's earth were mined in the parish and employment included the manufacture of cloth, operation of malt-kilns, breweries, and fulling- mills. The importance of weaving can be seen at the now derelict site of Freshford Mill, and the numerous weavers' cottages in the village. Dunkirk Mill, which was built in 1795 for Thomas Joyce, is now a residential property located just over the parish boundary in Hinton Charterhouse. The war memorial in the village commemorates the 17 men from the village who died in World War I and four from World War II. =Titfield Thunderbolt= The village is notable in that the houses have names instead of numbers, as was noted in the Ealing comedy The Titfield Thunderbolt, which was filmed locally in 1952 and where Freshford village served as the set for the idyllic English village under threat. The railway scenes were filmed on the Camerton branch line of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway. Passenger services started in 1910 and were suspended for the First World War in 1915; they resumed in 1923 but were withdrawn entirely in 1925. Freight services, mostly of coal, on the branch line ceased in 1951. The line achieved some fame after closure by its use in the 1952 film, but the track was taken up in 1958. The cricket scene was filmed near the former Viaduct Hotel at Limpley Stoke. Cricket is still played on this pitch, part of which is used by the local school. Governance Freshford village hall Freshford shares its parish council with Sharpstone and the surrounding hamlets. The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The village is part of the ward of Bathavon South in the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset. The ward is currently represented by Councillor Neil Butters, a member of the Liberal Democrats. Bath and North East Somerset was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. Its area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. The authority's administrative headquarters are in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon, with Freshford lying in Wansdyke. Before 1974 the parish was part of the Bathavon Rural District. It is also part of the North East Somerset parliamentary constituency, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020. Geography The village is in the valley of the River Avon close to the point at which it is joined by the River Frome. The Kennet and Avon Canal is visible across the Avon valley from the village, but the nearest crossings of the Avon are at Avoncliff and Limpley Stoke. Freshford's village centre is a conservation area which was created in 1975 and extended in April 2007, designated under the provisions of Section 69 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. Economy A significant number (20%) of local residents work from home using the internet. The village has a long-standing tradition of attracting \\"retired people of status\\". It is also a dormitory town for people working in Bath and Bristol (27%). Landmarks The Inn Most of the buildings and boundary walls are built from the local oolitic limestone. The 19th-century brewery and attached cottages are now a private residence. The tall ashlar chimney has a tapered octagonal shaft with moulded cap and provides an obvious landmark around the village. Freshford Manor is an 18th-century manor house. It was built on the site of an earlier house known as Pittes Place which dated from before 1603. The local pub is called The Inn, and sits beside the River Frome, a tributary of the River Avon. The Inn (which has never been an inn) is noted for its regular offering of music including jazz every Thursday night. Every third Monday musicians, professional and amateur alike, are welcome to come and play. =Freshford Mill= River Frome at Freshford Mill The Freshford Mill site comprises a mixture of buildings the oldest of which, the mill owner's house, dates back to the 17th century. There are also three major blocks from the late 18th/early 19th centuries, all in natural stone and clay tile or slate, and three more modern buildings from the 1950s and 1980s. The site features a mill channel with an internal wheel although a narrower mill leat was blocked many years ago. The site was used until 1993 by Peradins for the manufacture of rubber components for the car industry. Since the firm relocated to their new premises in Trowbridge the site has been essentially empty. In 2003 an application was made to turn the site into a rural recreation area, nature sanctuary and workshops. The site was sold to new owners and more recent proposals are for a residential estate. This has been opposed by local residents and the parish council. They have argued that the increase in the population of the village and the effect on the infrastructure such as the roads and school would be too great. There are also concerns because the site is within a Zone 3 floodplain, which is designated by the Environment Agency as having an annual probability of river flooding of 1% or greater. The site contains several protected species of bat. Transport Freshford is close to the A36. It is served by Freshford railway station, which opened in 1857. It has two platforms and is served by Great Western Railway and South Western Railway. A half-hourly peak and hourly off-peak service is provided northbound to Bath Spa and Bristol and southbound to Bradford-on-Avon, Trowbridge, Westbury and then further to Weymouth, Southampton and London Waterloo. In February 2006, Platform 2 at Freshford was raised by 30 cm to reduce the large stepping gap between the train and the platform. It was lowered in 1988 as part of the realignment of the track through the station to allow trains to pass at a faster speed. At the same time the platform was raised, the station also received additional improvements including better lighting and the construction of a new waiting shelter. The station gardens, funded by the Friends of Freshford, the Heart of Wessex Rail Partnership and the Freshford Parish Council, were opened on 26 July 2007 as a tribute to the Vaisey sisters, June and Dinah, who lovingly tended a garden at the station for many years. There is a brass plaque on the Bath-bound platform that commemorates this example of care, thoughtfulness and village pride. The sisters were also at the forefront of the campaign to raise the platform to allow easier access to the trains for passengers. Education Freshford Primary School, a co- educational primary school for children aged 4 to 11, was founded in 1847 and has been recently modernised. Religious sites St Peters Church St Peter's Church, on the north side of the village, has a very old Christian marking on the back of the church and parts of the church date back to the fifteenth century. The tower was added in 1514. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. The churchyard has a number of Georgian chest tombs, dating from the late 18th and early 19th century, four of which are listed in their own right. The Methodist Chapel was built around 1783 and extended in 1850. It was opened by John Wesley, who preached here several times and mentioned it in his journals. Public services Freshford Village Memorial Hall plays host to many events, including painting classes, aerobics, badminton, drama productions, and much more. It is particularly useful for children's parties, wedding receptions and similar events, the scale of charges being very competitive, and a thriving pre-school also uses the facility. It is situated on Freshford Lane between the centre of Freshford and Park Corner; it is well maintained, but is of typical mid-20th century construction and fails to meet the present requirements for energy conservation and contains some asbestos. The Hall and adjacent playing field are owned by a charity which is run by a management committee of Trustees including representatives of the regular users. The object of the charity's Foundation is \\"the provision and maintenance of a village hall for the use of the inhabitants of Freshford and the neighbourhood without distinction of sex or political, religious or other opinion, and in particular for use for meetings, lectures and classes, and other forms of recreation and leisure-time occupation, with the object of improving the conditions of life for the said inhabitants.\\"Scheme Made by the Secretary of State for Education and Science No. 4806L sealed 30 June 1964. The replacement of the existing hall by a modern construction with enhanced and additional facilities is under active consideration by the Trustees and local residents. Notable people The village was the birthplace of John Bythesea, a naval officer awarded the Victoria Cross.Online biography John Bythesea Michael Hart was born in Freshford in c. 1814 and emigrated to Christchurch in New Zealand in 1850, where he was chosen as the 7th Mayor of Christchurch.

He fled to the Byzantine Empire and continued to govern those parts of the patriarchate that were under Byzantine rule. He was a prominent writer of religious texts, and reformer of religious and charitable foundations. Prior to his patriarchate, John was a monk. In 1085 or 1092, he wrote a treatise on the practice of charistikion, whereby the emperor could grant a monastery to a private person for a specified period. He was critical of the practice, which he blamed for a decline in monasticism. John took office as patriarch before September 1089, when the city of Antioch was still under Muslim rule. He did not leave Constantinople for Antioch until 1091. At the time of the Siege of Antioch in 1097 by the Christian armies of the First Crusade, he was imprisoned by the Seljuk governor Yağısıyan, who suspected his loyalty. On occasion he was hung from the city walls and his feet were hit by iron rods. According to the Historia belli sacri (c. 1131), after the siege the Christian women of the city went to release the imprisoned patriarch, only to find that he could not stand, his legs having been weakened by so long a confinement.John France, \\"The Use of the Anonymous Gesta Francorum in the Early Twelfth-Century Sources for the First Crusade,\\" in Alan V. Murray, ed., From Clermont to Jerusalem: The Crusades and Crusader Societies, 1095–1500 (Turnhout: Brepols, 1998), 38. When the crusaders captured the city in 1098, John was released and restored to power. The crusaders decided to established a Latin bishop in Albara (where there was no Greek bishop established), Peter of Narbonne. Since Peter had been consecrated by patriarch John, both prelates coexisted for a while, until John became politically inconvenient for the ruling prince. Bohemond accused him of conspiring with Byzantine emperor Alexios I, and John was exiled to Constantinople. In October 1100, he formally renounced his office and entered the Hodegon Monastery. He was succeed in Antioch by a Latin, Bernard of Valence, who thus established the line of Latin Patriarchs of Antioch. John made enemies among the monks of his new home and was forced to leave the Hodegon for the island of Oxeia in the Sea of Marmara, where he was eventually buried. He wrote invective \\"panegyrics\\" against Alexios I, whom he blamed for the state of the empire; against those who owned \\"cities within cities\\", especially tax collectors; and against the Azymites (i.e., Latins, who used unleavened bread in the Eucharist). The latter treatise may have been occasioned by the visit to Constantinople of Grosolanus, Archbishop of Milan, in 1112. John never returned to Antioch and after him new Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch were appointed in Constantinople, remaining there until it was possible to restore them in Antioch late in the 13th century.

The ground was opened on 10 September 1892 and is located between Aylestone Road and Welford Road on the southern edge of the city centre. The ground was developed in two main periods, either side of the First World War stands were built on both sides and then between 1995 and 2016 both ends were developed and the north side redeveloped. The stadium has a capacity of 25,849, making it the largest purpose-built club rugby union ground in England. It hosted five full England national team matches between 1902 and 1923, and staged a single match at each of the 1991 and 1999 Rugby World Cups.  History  In 1891 Leicester rented a ground in the north of the city, on the Belgrave Road where Roberts Road and Buller Road now stand, called the Belgrave Road Cycle and Cricket Ground, at the end of the 1890/91 season Leicester applied for a renewal of the lease but found the terms unacceptable. A committee was formed to find a suitable new ground and in December 1891 accepted the town corporation's offer of a 10-year lease on the ground between Aylestone Road and Welford Road, at the time this was the edge of the built up town. The lease was signed in March 1892 and £1,100 was spent leveling, draining and preparing the ground. The ground was opened on 10 September 1892 when Leicester played the first game at the ground against a Leicestershire XV. The first stands accommodated 3,000 spectators and that season saw derby matches produce attendances up to 7,000 whilst 10,000 saw Leicester lose 12-0 to Coventry in the second round of the Midlands Counties Cup. The original club house built in 1909 was located on Aylestone Road, the ground was known as Welford Road rather than Aylestone Road as at this time the cricket club played on another sportsground on the Aylestone Road. The Members' & Crumbie Stands were built just before and just after the First World War respectively. The east side of the ground was developed in 1995, originally terracing on an ash bank it became an all seater modern stand. Initially called the Alliance and Leicester Stand it is currently known as the Mattioli Woods Stand. The total ground capacity is currently 25,849 after the north stand (Members' Stand originally) was redeveloped in 2008 and west stand (previously clubhouse end) in 2016. The newly opened West Stand (Robin Hood Stand) is a new all seating stand replacing the original 1909 clubhouse and a 1980s extension at the Aylestone Road end. Costing £6.7m the new stand has 2,917 spaces for general admittance & 190 executive seats. Replacing a temporary stand housing 992 places it has brought the capacity of the stadium to 25,849. The stand is currently known as the Robin Hood Stand due to a sponsorship agreement with Nottingham Building Society. Before redevelopment of Welford Road began in 2008 Leicester Tigers explored many other options. On 23 November 2004 the club announced that it had entered into a 50–50 joint venture with the city's main football club, Leicester City, to purchase City's current ground, King Power Stadium then known as the Walkers Stadium. If the purchase had gone through, the Tigers would have surrendered their lease on Welford Road and moved into Walkers Stadium. However, after several months of talks, the two clubs could not agree as to which side would have priority at Walkers Stadium, and they ended any ground share plans in July 2005.Tigers call off ground share plan Leicester purchased the freehold to the ground and adjacent land in 2006 prior to this the club operated on a long term 99 year rolling lease from the city council. On 11 June 2007 the club announced plans that it was working with AFL, who were involved in redeveloping Manchester United's Old Trafford, for a redevelopment plan which would raise the capacity from 17,498 to 25,000 by 2011. On 20 February 2008 Leicester Tigers received planning consent for the £60million redevelopment of their Welford Road home. The first phase of the development would include space for 10,000 supporters in a new North Stand (Granby Halls side), taking capacity up from 17,498 to 24,000. After full renovation it will have a capacity of above 30,000.Tigers stadium development In the summer of 2008 work began on the construction of the new North Stand – then called the \\"Caterpillar Stand\\" after the club's main sponsor, Caterpillar Inc., currently known as the Holland and Barrett Stand again due to sponsorship. The work was completed for the first home game of the 2009-10 season against Newcastle Falcons. The stand has room for 10,000 spectators along with a 1,000 seat hospitality suite. On the ground floor is the Final Whistle bar where no ticket is required for entry. An official opening ceremony took place on 6 November 2009 when Tigers beat world champions . In October 2020 it was confirmed that the Tigers had extended their long term partnership with Mattioli Woods. The new five year deal will run until the end of the 2024–25 season and includes naming rights to the stadium which became Mattioli Woods Welford Road. StadiumNorth Stand (Holland and Barrett Stand)= The Holland and Barrett Stand Officially opened on 19 September 2009 against Newcastle Falcons with a total capacity of 10,000, it was originally called the Caterpillar Stand but was renamed in 2014 to the MET-Rx Stand then after Holland and Barrett became the main sponsors for 2016/17 season they received the naming rights to the North Stand. The first development on the northern side of the ground was a 3,000 seat pavilion moved from the Belgrave Road Cycle and Cricket Ground in 1892, expanded by a further 500 people a year later. This stand was moved to the south side of the ground in 1899 and replaced with a new stand seating 2,020 people. In 1913 work began to replace this stand with the New Members' Stand seating 4,000. With the First World War intervening it was not opened until 1918. This stand was widely known as the Members' Stand until 1999 when the stand became known as the Next Stand due to a sponsorship from Next plc. In 2008 the stand was demolished to make room for the current stand. =South stand (Breedon stand)= The first development of the south side of the ground was in 1893 when a 600-seat stand was erected, in 1895 a press box was added. In 1899 the Old Members' Stand was moved from the north side of the ground and enlarged to 3,120 seats. The New Stand (later renamed the Crumbie Stand in honour of Tom Crumbie) costing £21,000 (approx £850,000 in 2016) was officially opened on 2 October 1920 before a match against Headingley by the President of the RFU Ernest Prescott, Tigers celebrated with a 33-3 victory. Terracing was added as a paddock in front of the stand the next year to bring the capacity of the stand to circa 10,000. Due to health and safety regulations and the demands of the modern day coaches and broadcasters the seated capacity of the stand available to the general public has decreased from 4,500 to 4,269, the addition of a central walk way to the terrace has also seen the terrace capacity decrease. In 2010, the Crumbie Stand was renamed the Holland & Barrett Stand after health food chain Holland & Barrett had signed a sponsorship deal with Tigers the previous year. In July 2016, after the health and supplements company were declared main sponsors and naming rights to the North Stand, the stand was renamed the south stand, however in 2018, the stand was renamed the Breedon stand due to sponsorship reasons. =East Stand (Mattioli Woods Stand)= Mattioli Woods stand, previously known as the Alliance and Leicester Stand Originally the Alliance and Leicester Stand, the East Stand is an all-seater and 26 executive suites stand built for £2.3m in 1995 on the East Bank of the ground. With a capacity of 2,650 seats for general admittance, it increased Welford Road's capacity to 16,815. In 2010, the Alliance and Leicester Stand was renamed to the Goldsmiths Stand after a change of sponsorship. In 2016, the stand's name was changed to the Mattioli Woods stand after a sponsorship deal with Mattioli Woods =West Stand (Robin Hood Stand)= After a controversial decision in which the RFU announced that Welford Road would not host any World Cup 2015 matches opting instead for the King Power Stadium, Tigers released plans for the second stage of redevelopment in which the 100 year old clubhouse and the temporary stand was demolished and a new stand built. It could hold 3,100 fans, 62 disabled fans and their assistants and increase the stadium's capacity to 25,849. Building for the new stand started the week after Leicester's final home match of the season against Northampton Saints where they beat Saints 22–14. Part of the Stand was open for game against Wasps on 1 November 2015. Before Christmas, Tigers announced that they signed a deal with Caterpillar for the new stand to be the new Caterpillar Stand. The stand was fully seated for the Northampton Saints Derby on 9 January 2016, a match which they won 30–27. It was announced in July 2016, that the stand would be renamed to the Robin Hood Stand after a new sponsorship deal with the Nottingham Building Society. =Scoreboards= Since the end of the 2013-14 season, there have been two large screen TVs at the top of the West Stand and just by the right of the East Stand. The screens are used for showing the match, scores, TMO replays, advertisements from sponsors and the line-ups for each team. Notable matches The stadium has hosted seven full cap international games. It hosted pool matches during both the 19911991 world cup at news.bbc.co.uk and 19991999 world cup at news.bbc.co.uk Rugby World Cups. The stadium has also occasionally hosted England Saxons (previously England A and before that England B) and England U20 matches, and non-cap matches between international touring sides and Leicester or a Midlands or East Midlands XV. =International matches= Other use  Since 2002 for men, and 2004 for women, the annual Varsity Match between De Montfort University and Leicester University has been held at Welford Road. In rugby league's Super League IX, London Broncos as the nominal home side took on Hull F.C. 20 June 2004, with Hull winning 42–26. Welford Road has also played host to American Football, with a charity match in aid of Matt Hampson taking place on 28 May 2007 between the Loughborough University Aces and reunited 90s team Leicester Panthers. National League team Leicester Falcons also played a league match at the stadium as part of a fundraiser for local charity LOROS, beating the Birmingham Bulls 22–15 on 12 June 2010. On 15 July 2010, Welford Road held its first pop concert with James Morrison playing followed on the 16th by Will Young. Records The record for the highest attendance at Welford Road was set on 4 October 1924, when 35,000 people saw Leicester play the touring New Zealand team. The highest attendance for a league fixture, and the highest post-war attendance, was 25,849 for the derby match against Northampton Saints on 9 January 2016, following the opening of the new Caterpillar Stand.

Hydrogen (H) is the most abundant element in the universe. On Earth, common H-containing inorganic molecules include water (H2O), hydrogen gas (H2), methane (CH4), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and ammonia (NH3). Many organic compounds also contain H atoms, such as hydrocarbons and organic matter. Given the ubiquity of hydrogen atoms in inorganic and organic chemical compounds, the hydrogen cycle is focused on molecular hydrogen, H2. Hydrogen gas can be produced naturally through rock-water interactions or as a byproduct of microbial metabolisms. Free H2 can then be consumed by other microbes, oxidized photochemically in the atmosphere, or lost to space. Hydrogen is also thought to be an important reactant in pre-biotic chemistry and the early evolution of life on Earth, and potentially elsewhere in our solar system.  Abiotic cycles  Sources = Abiotic sources of hydrogen gas include water-rock and photochemical reactions. Exothermic serpentinization reactions between water and olivine minerals produce H2 in the marine or terrestrial subsurface. In the ocean, hydrothermal vents erupt magma and altered seawater fluids including abundant H2, depending on the temperature regime and host rock composition. Molecular hydrogen can also be produced through photooxidation (via solar UV radiation) of some mineral species such as siderite in anoxic aqueous environments. This may have been an important process in the upper regions of early Earth's Archaean oceans. = Sinks = Because H2 is the lightest element, atmospheric H2 can readily be lost to space via Jeans escape, an irreversible process that drives Earth's net mass loss. Photolysis of heavier compounds not prone to escape, such as CH4 or H2O, can also liberate H2 from the upper atmosphere and contribute to this process. Another major sink of free atmospheric H2 is photochemical oxidation by hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which forms water. Anthropogenic sinks of H2 include synthetic fuel production through the Fischer-Tropsch reaction and artificial nitrogen fixation through the Haber-Bosch process to produce nitrogen fertilizers.  Biotic cycles  Many microbial metabolisms produce or consume H2. = Production = Hydrogen is produced by hydrogenases and nitrogenases enzymes in many microorganisms, some of which are being studied for their potential for biofuel production. These H2-metabolizing enzymes are found in all three domains of life, and out of known genomes over 30% of microbial taxa contain hydrogenase genes. Fermentation produces H2 from organic matter as part of the anaerobic microbial food chain via light-dependent or light- independent pathways. = Consumption = Biological soil uptake is the dominant sink of atmospheric H2. Both aerobic and anaerobic microbial metabolisms consume H2 by oxidizing it in order to reduce other compounds during respiration. Aerobic H2 oxidation is known as the Knallgas reaction. Anaerobic H2 oxidation often occurs during interspecies hydrogen transfer in which H2 produced during fermentation is transferred to another organism, which uses the H2 to reduce CO2 to CH4 or acetate, SO42- to H2S, or Fe3+ to Fe2+. Interspecies hydrogen transfer keeps H2 concentrations very low in most environments because fermentation becomes less thermodynamically favorable as the partial pressure of H2 increases. Relevance for the global climate H2 can interfere with the removal of methane from the atmosphere, a greenhouse gas. Typically, atmospheric CH4 is oxidized by hydroxyl radicals (•OH), but H2 can also react with •OH to reduce it to H2O. # \\\\mathrm{CH_4 + OH \\\\longrightarrow CH_3 + H_2O} # \\\\mathrm{H_2 + OH \\\\longrightarrow H + H_2O}  Implications for Astrobiology  Hydrothermal H2 may have played a major role in pre-biotic chemistry. Production of H2 by serpentinization supported formation of the reactants proposed in the iron-sulfur world origin of life hypothesis. The subsequent evolution of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is hypothesized as one of the earliest metabolisms on Earth. Serpentinization can occur on any planetary body with chondritic composition. The discovery of H2 on other ocean worlds, such as Enceladus, suggests that similar processes are ongoing elsewhere in our solar system, and potentially in other solar systems as well. \\\\---- = See also = * Biogeochemical cycle * Carbon cycle * Hydrogen * Methane *Serpentinization *Interspecies Hydrogen Transfer *Fermentation *Hydrothermal Vents *Water cycle *Ocean World Exploration Program  References  Category:Biogeochemical cycle Category:Metabolism Cycle Category:Hydrogen biology ","title":"Hydrogen cycle"},{"id":"2465481","text":"Ormiston is a village in East Lothian, Scotland, near Tranent, Humbie, Pencaitland and Cranston, located on the north bank of the River Tyne at an elevation of about . The village was the first planned village in Scotland, founded in 1735 by John Cockburn (1685–1758), one of the initiators of the Agricultural Revolution.  Name  The word Ormiston is derived from a half mythical Anglian settler called Ormr, meaning 'serpent' or 'snake'. 'Ormres' family had possession of the land during the 12th and 13th centuries. Ormiston or 'Ormistoun' is not an uncommon surname, and Ormr also survives in some English placenames such as Ormskirk and Ormesby. The latter part of the name, formerly spelt 'toun', is likely to descend from its Northumbrian Old English and later Scots meaning as 'farmstead' or 'farm and outbuildings' rather than the meaning 'town'. There was an \\"Ormiston\\" in Berwickshire, near Linton, where the legend of the Worm of Linton was related to land ownership by Lord Somerville and Lord Lindsay. The Cockburn family may have brought the name from the Berwickshire \\"Ormiston\\" to the East Lothian location in the 14th- century.  History  Ormiston was the home of the poet Elizabeth Douglas (d. 1594), wife of Samuel Cockburn of Templehall,Gordon MacGregor, 'Cockburn of Ormiston', Red Book of Scotland, vol. 3 (2020), pp. 78-9. who with Mary Beaton contributed sonnets to a work by the poet William Fowler in 1587. Fowler wrote an epitaph for her.Sebastiaan Verweij, The Literary Culture of Early Modern Scotland (Oxford, 2017), pp. 81, 84-87. William Begg, Robert Burns's nephew became the parish schoolmaster at Ormiston. The whole Begg family moved to live with him at Ormiston's schoolhouse. Isabella Begg nee Burns also ran a school here. The family later moved to nearby Tranent in 1834 when William resigned his post and emigrated to America.  Description  The village consists mainly of a broad Main Street, with a row of mostly two storey houses along each side. It crosses two bridges, one over the now redundant railway route, and the other a narrow bridge over the river Tyne. Using strict guidelines for its appearance, John Cockburn put housing for artisans and cottage industries (spinning and weaving) around the original mill hamlet. When he did not achieve the expected return on his investment, he sold it to the Earl of Hopetoun in 1747. The linen trade became a failure, and by 1811 the distillery shut down. A brewery and one of Scotland's first bleachfields were also built here as well. Ormiston later became a mining village. The Ormiston Coal Company's workings were south of Tranent in East Lothian. The company was one of a number of small concerns working either a single or a few linked, small pits on the East Lothian coalfield. = Ormiston Coal Co. Ltd. = The principal collieries at Ormiston were: * Limeylands (NT406695, west of the Mercat Cross), opened 1895, closed 1954, though the Coal Preparation Plant stayed in use until about October 1958. * Tynemount (NT401686, west-south-west of the Mercat Cross), opened 1924, closed January 1952, but not formally abandoned until 1962. * Oxenford No. 2 (NT393678, south-west of Tynemount), opened 1926, closed 1950. * Oxenford No. 3 (NT393677), a new pit very close by, was opened by the National Coal Board, but closed in 1952. * Winton Mine (NT421699), first provided for ventilation purposes in 1943, but developed as a mine by the National Coal Board in 1952, closed in 1962. = Ormiston Hall = Ormiston Hall, prior to the fire which left it in ruins Ormiston Hall lay to the south of the village. It was built for John Cockburn in 1745–48 and was later extended for the Earl of Hopetoun. It was added to on at least three occasions in the next 100 years. The Hall now lies in ruins following a fire during World War II with residential properties built in and around the grounds. The remains of the pre-Reformation St Giles Parish Church can still be seen nearby. The Great Yew of Ormiston grows to the south of the hall site. It is a rare example of a layering yew-tree and, according to the Forestry Commission, is up to one thousand years old. = Shops in Ormiston = There are a number of shops in Ormiston. On the Main Street: * The Co-operative Store * Post Office Ltd – At the end of 2011, the Post Office changed ownership and the new profile is as a grocery shop with a Post Office counter. Elsewhere in the village: * The Little Superstore There are a number of small businesses operating from units in the Cockburn Halls, formerly the Miners' Welfare building. = Mercat Cross = The 15th-century pre-Reformation Mercat Cross on Main Street is unusual for its truly cruciform shape, with three modern steps and a railed enclosure. It is in the care of Historic Scotland.  Notable people  * Birthplace of the Scottish Congregationalist missionary Robert Moffat (1795–1883); a memorial is erected in his name. He was the father-in-law of David Livingstone, the medical missionary and explorer. His father was a custom house officer; the family of his mother, Ann Gardiner, had lived for several generations at Ormiston. * The religious reformer and Protestant martyr George Wishart was captured in December 1545 by the Earl of Bothwell while hiding at Ormiston Hall. * John Cockburn of Ormiston, Protestant laird, (d. 1583) and his brother, Ninian Cockburn, (d. 1579), political agent. * John Cockburn of Ormiston (c. 1685–1758), landowner and agricultural reformer. * Charles Maclaren, journalist and geologist, co- founded The Scotsman newspaper, and edited the 6th Edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica * Col.

It is also used as a personal residence by some of the worker-owners. Inaugurated in 1978, the four-star establishment received generous government subsidies in anticipation of the 1978 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Buenos Aires that June. The original owner, Marcelo Iurcovich, received 37 million USD for its development in 1976 from the Banco Nacional de Desarollo (BANADE), a state-owned business lender later absorbed into the Banco de la Nación Argentina. Tourism in Argentina subsequently suffered from the effects of the military dictatorship's Dirty War and the collapse of its economic policies, however. The hotel's finances worsened further after the opening of a number of newer, competing hotels in the 1990s, and during the crisis that developed in the early 2000s. In the wake of the December riots in 2001, and after systematic firings, the Hotel Bauen was closed on December 28. In March 2003, with the help of the Movimiento Nacional de Empresas Recuperadas (National Movement of Recovered Businesses, MNER), the hotel's former employees occupied the building. While fighting for ownership through activism and negotiation, they began repairs to the building and slowly re-opened business. Since then, the Bauen cooperative has gained 150 workers, inaugurated a streetfront café (whose tile floors come from FaSinPat, a worker-controlled ceramics factory) and equipped more than 200 hotel rooms.Frustrated Argentines take business into own hands, Christian Science Monitor, 2003 Today the Hotel Bauen boasts rising profits, and is a center of cultural and political activity in Buenos Aires.BAUEN Hotel: Struggle, culture and work Zmag, 2005 However, the long term legality of the worker's ownership and operation is ambiguous. On October 21, 2005, the hotel was informed that, while a legal right of former employees to keep residence in the hotel was recognized, they were not permitted to function as a business. Upon delivery of this notice, entrances were closed off with official tape, but this tape was quickly removed by hotel workers, and business operations continue today.La Vaca In May 2006, Judge Carla Cavaliere officially approved the suspension of the closure order. Workers can now move freely and legally in and out of the hotel. What remains to be determined is who is to be considered the official owner of the hotel. A bill of expropriation, the Ley Nacional de Expropiación, which would definitively entitle the Bauen workers to ownership of the hotel, has already been drafted and is being considered at the municipal and federal levels. Sponsored by Deputy Victoria Donda in the National Congress, the bill is being opposed by the original owners, led by Marcelo Iurcovich, and supported by the Bauen Cooperative, who are circulating a petition in support of the bill.

The first issue was published in the form of a hand-stapled fanzine with text produced on a typewriter. Over the years the magazine evolved into a mature glossy but it has kept street style and youth culture central. i-D has also held exhibitions worldwide and published several books. Details The magazine is known for its innovative photography and typography and as a training ground for fresh talent. Photographers Wolfgang Tillmans, Mario Testino, Terry Richardson, Craig McDean, Nick Knight and Juergen Teller started their careers at i-D, as did Dylan Jones and Caryn Franklin. Other photographers that have contributed to i-D include Ellen von Unwerth and Kayt Jones. People who have appeared in i-D include Madonna, John Galliano, Alexander McQueen, Kanye West, Helmut Lang, Franz Ferdinand, Chloë Sevigny, Raf Simons, Jun Takahashi, Veronique Branquinho, Lily Cole, Giles Deacon, Dizzee Rascal, Scarlett Johansson, Rick Owens, Selena Gomez, Debbie McGee and Rihanna. In 1984, Tony Elliott of Time Out became a publishing partner with a 51% share of the company. Jones remained editor-in-chief and creative director, but he also worked on other commercial projects. In 2004, Jones—together with his wife Tricia, regained total control of the company. Vice Media acquired i-D in 2012. The magazine pioneered the hybrid style of documentary/fashion photography called The Straight Up. At first, these were of punks and new wave youth found on English streets and who were simply asked to stand against any nearby blank wall. The resulting pictures—the subjects facing the camera and seen from \\"top to toe\\"—are a vivid historical documentary photography archive, and have established the posed \\"straight up\\" as a valid style of documentary picture- making. I-D turned right is used to signify a wink, a theme with the magazine. Tipped on its side, the \\"i-D\\" typographic logo reveals a winking smiley. Most issues of i-D have featured a winking cover model. i-Ds 25th anniversary in 2005 was celebrated with an exhibition (i-Dentity) and guest-edited issues. Terry Jones invited a number of creative collaborators to work with him on different identity issues.

Murphy (born circa 1967) is an American anthropologist and writer. His work has focused on environmental issues and various Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints-related topics. Biography Murphy is a member of the LDS Church. He earned a Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Washington in 2003. , he teaches in the Department of Anthropology at Edmonds Community College in Washington state. He founded the Learn and Serve Environmental Anthropology Field (LEAF) School in 2006. The LEAF School offers field-based service-learning courses in human ecology and archaeology and specializes in the application of traditional ecological knowledge to sustainability projects. The Washington Association of Conservation Districts selected Murphy as its Conservation Educator of the Year in 2011. The Puget Sound Regional Council selected the Japanese Gulch Fish Passage Project in 2012 for a Vision 2040 Award, highlighting the anthropology and archaeology field training led by Murphy. His academic publications focus on wildlife corridors, social marketing, environmental education, and Mormon representations of Native Americans. In 1997, he located an isolated LDS faction in Mexico of the Third Convention group, which scholars previously believed to have died out decades earlier. Murphy's research has been published in the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion; Ethnohistory; the Journal of Mormon History; the Review of Religious Research; Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought; Sunstone; Social Science Research Network, the 2002 book American Apocrypha: More Essays on the Book of Mormon, edited by Brent Lee Metcalfe and Dan Vogel. =Controversial essay= Murphy drew attention in the media and from the leadership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) after the publication of his essay, \\"Lamanite Genesis, Genealogy, and Genetics\\" in the 2002 book American Apocrypha. This essay discusses the genetic evidence for the geographic origin and lineage of Native American groups. It relies on evidence regarding mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited directly from the mother; the Y chromosome, inherited from the father; and nuclear DNA. Murphy posited that DNA evidence suggests that Native Americans are descendants of individuals from northeastern Siberia—corroborating conclusions that anthropologists have long held. He notes the 99.6 percent absence of genetic heritage outside of known indigenous Native American haplogroups. (The remaining 0.4 percent is near-universally agreed among anthropologists and biologists studying the issue to represent genetic markers that were introduced after the year 1492.) In his essay, Murphy writes that DNA and other research contradicts numerous LDS doctrinal claims, such as that Native Americans are descended from Middle Eastern people who immigrated to the Americas circa 600 BC: > From a scientific perspective, the BoMor's [Book of Mormon's] origin is best > situated in early 19th century America, not ancient America. There were no > Lamanites prior to c. 1828 and dark skin is not a physical trait of God's > malediction. Native Americans do not need to accept Christianity or the > BoMor to know their own history. The BoMor emerged from Joseph Smith's own > struggles with his God. Mormons need to look inward for spiritual validation > and cease efforts to remake Native Americans in their own image. Murphy concluded that \\"DNA research lends no support to traditional Mormon beliefs about the origins of Native Americans\\" and he has likened the Book of Mormon to inspirational fiction. Murphy has reaffirmed this point several times since the initial publication of his essay in interviews and in videos produced by Living Hope Ministries, a Utah-based evangelical Christian ministry that produces literature and films that question and criticize Mormonism. In a review in 2006, the FARMS Institute responded to Murphy's claims. =Subsequent action= Murphy's review of genetic research was expanded upon by molecular biologist Simon Southerton, a former Mormon bishop, with his study Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans DNA, and the Mormon Church, Signature Books, 2004, which gives a more complete accounting of the current status of Polynesians and Native Americans in context with national studies, Mormon scholars and concessions by geneticists from BYU. Other researchers such as Scott Woodward are critical of Southerton's work. In response to the publication of \\"Lamanite Genesis, Genealogy, and Genetics\\", Murphy's LDS stake president asked him to either recant his position regarding DNA evidence and the Book of Mormon or resign his membership in the LDS Church. Murphy declined both suggestions, so Latimer scheduled a disciplinary council for December 8, 2002. Such a council might have resulted in Murphy's disfellowshipment or excommunication from the church. Murphy's situation received widespread media attention and generated protest actions from some Mormon intellectual groups. On December 7, 2002, less than 24 hours before the scheduled meeting time, Latimer indefinitely postponed Murphy's disciplinary council.

It is part of the Lewis Range, which spans much of the park. It is located in the remote southwestern portion of the park, approximately west of the Continental Divide and southeast of Lake McDonald. It is drained by Pinchot Creek (on the south) and Nyack Creek (on the other sides), both of which flow into the Middle Fork of the Flathead River. The mountain is named for Henry L. Stimson (1867–1950), former U.S. Secretary of State and twice Secretary of War, who hiked and assisted George Bird Grinnell survey the area in and around Glacier National Park in the 1890s, and supported efforts to establish the national park. Notability Mount Stimson is notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain. For example, its northwest face rises over from Nyack Creek in only . This makes it \\"truly a monster of a mountain.\\" It is also notable for its isolation; it is one of the farthest peaks from a roadhead in the park. History The first recorded ascent of Mount Stimson was in 1951, by J. Gordon Edwards and Alice Edwards; however they found clear evidence of a previous ascent. The standard route of ascent is the West or Northwest Face Route, starting from Nyack Creek. A backpacking trail runs along Nyack Creek, providing access; however the National Park Service warns that this is a more brushy and isolated trail than in other areas of the park, with numerous unbridged stream crossings. As in the rest of the park, grizzly bears are an issue as well. The climbing route begins with \\"tiresome uphill bushwhacking...for possibly three hours\\" leading to alternating slopes and cliffs (Grades 3 and 4). Other routes on the peak include the Southeast Spur from Martha's Basin and the Pinchot Creek Route from the south.

He is a member of the Game Freak board of directors, and has been employed at the company since 1989 when he founded it alongside Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimorihttps://www.gamefreak.co.jp/town/30th/en/ With the development of new Pokémon games, Masuda took new roles in future projects. He began to produce and direct games, starting with Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, and became responsible for approving new character models. His style seeks to keep games accessible while still adding increasing levels of complexity. His work sticks to older mainstays of the series, including a focus on handheld game consoles and 2D graphics. His music draws inspiration from the work of modern celebrated composers like Dmitri Shostakovich, though he used the Super Mario series as a model of good video game composition. Life Masuda was born on January 12, 1968 in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As a child, his family often vacationed in Kyūshū, where many of his relatives still live. There he spent his time catching fish and insects, a pastime that later influenced his video game design. Masuda modeled the Pokémon series's Hoenn Region after Kyūshū in an attempt to recapture his memories of summers there. In high school, Masuda played the trombone; he soon discovered classical music, and was drawn in by works like Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5. Masuda attended the Japan Electronics College, a technical school in Shinjuku, Tokyo, where he studied computer graphics and the C programming language using a DEC Professional. His daughter Kiri was born in September 2002; he named a character in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire after her. Career Masuda has worked at Game Freak since the company's inception in 1989, and has been involved in nearly every title that Game Freak has produced. Masuda was one of the original developers of the Pokémon series, beginning with Pokémon Red and Green. He was first hired to compose video game music, where his first game at Game Freak was Mendel Palace, a 1989 puzzle game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. After Mendel Palace, he worked on Yoshi, the company's first collaboration with Nintendo. When the company first began releasing Pokémon titles, Masuda worked mainly as the composer, though he did minor programming work as well, and later began directing and producing them. His work on the first games included writing the program to play audio in the games, music, and sound effects. Masuda has been directly involved in the naming and design of many Pokémon. He has stated that one of the hardest aspects of design is making sure that a Pokémon's name and attributes will appeal to a global audience. Since Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, Masuda has been one of the main employees who approve or reject designs for new Pokémon. He now serves as a member of the Game Freak board of directors. On September 28, 2018, Masuda revealed that during the early years of developing Pokémon games, \\"game data was nearly lost in a computer crash\\". Masuda described it as \\"the most nerve-racking moment in development\\", saying \\"We were developing the game on these Unix computer stations called the Sun SPARCstation 1. We’re developing, and they’re these Unix boxes, and they crashed quite a bit.\\" On November 1, 2018, Masuda stated that Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! would likely be his final time serving as director for the main series Pokémon games. In the announcement interview, he stated that he wished to pass on the development torch to the younger generation of developers at Game Freak. In November 2019, Junichi Masuda became interested in singing, and he decided to have an ending theme song from the Pokémon anime which is titled \\"Pokémon Shiritori (Pikachu → Mew Ver.)\\" which was performed by the Pokémon Kids 2019, on April 5, 2020, he have a new ending theme song from the Pokémon anime which is titled \\"Pokémon Shiritori (Mew → Zamazenta Ver.)\\" which was performed by Pokémon Kids 2019, finally, on April 26, 2020 he released the full ending theme song from the Pokémon anime which is titled \\"Pokémon Shiritori (Full Size Ver.)\\" which was performed by Pokémon Kids 2019. On May 8, 2020, he released the first off vocal version of the ending theme song from the Pokémon anime which is titled \\"[Karaoke] Pokémon Shiritori (Pikachu → Mew Ver.)\\", on May 11, 2020, he released the second off vocal version of the ending theme song from the Pokémon anime which is titled \\"[Karaoke] Pokémon Shiritori (Mew → Zamazenta Ver.)\\".Juichi Masuda becomes a singer, so he released the first full ending theme song from the Pokémon anime titled \\"Pokémon Shiritori (Full Size Ver.)\\", performed by Pokémon Kids 2019. Retrieved November 24, 2019. Influences and style Masuda approaches each of his games with the mindset that a beginner should be able to easily play it. In view of this, his games begin in an easily approachable and accessible style, with more layers of complexity being introduced as the player progresses through the game. He believes that handheld systems provide an opportunity for social interaction that cannot be found on non-handheld console systems. He has stated that the continued use of 2D computer graphics has been integral to Pokémon's success. Masuda's musical style draws from a number of sources, particularly classical music and the works of Igor Stravinsky and Dmitri Shostakovich. His favorite musical genre is techno, and he has looked to the music of the Super Mario series as an example of video game music that works well. Most of his ideas draw inspiration from simply observing real life and visualizing how he would design or draw outside objects. As a rule, he does not use previous characters as inspirations for new ones, instead creating each new one from independent sources.

French started his publishing business in New York City in 1854. In 1859 he visited London, where he met Lacy, who had given up the stage and been active as a theatrical bookseller since the mid-1840s. Lacy, who had removed his shop from Wellington Street, Covent Garden to 89 Strand in 1857, had also started publishing acting editions of dramas. Lacy's Acting Edition of Plays, published between 1848 and 1873, would eventually run to 99 volumes containing 1,485 individual pieces. French and Lacy became partners, each acting as the other's agent across the Atlantic. In 1872, French decided to take up permanent residence in London, leaving his son Thomas Henry French in charge of the New York business. When Lacy retired in 1873, he sold out to French for five thousand pounds. Lacy died in the same year, and French finally established his name as the most important theatrical publisher in England. At the time of his own death in 1898 almost all renowned English playwrights of the present and recent past had been represented by his company. See also *Samuel French, Inc.

Colding Ludwig August Colding (13 July 1815 – 21 March 1888) was a Danish civil engineer and physicist who articulated the principle of conservation of energy contemporaneously with, and independently of, James Prescott Joule and Julius Robert von Mayer though his contribution was largely overlooked and neglected. Life Born in Holbæk, Denmark, his father, Andreas Christian, had been an officer in the Danish privateer service. Ludwig's mother, Anna Sophie, was the daughter of a clergyman and imbued the household with a deeply religious sentiment. Around the time of Ludwig's birth, his father retired from seafaring and took up a position as a farm manager. He seems to have been particularly unsuited to such a profession and this, together with the upheavals of the Napoleonic Wars in Denmark, subjected the young Ludwig to a rather irregular childhood and schooling.P. F. Dahl (1981) \\"Colding, Ludwig August\\" in ) Hans Christian Ørsted was an old family friend and arranged for Colding to serve an apprenticeship under a craftsman in Copenhagen, Colding achieving the status of journeyman in 1836. Ørsted had, by this stage, become something of a mentor to the young Colding and encouraged him to enroll at the Copenhagen Polytechnic Institute. The Institute had been founded at Ørsted's initiative and he offered continual advice and support to the young Colding. At the polytechnic Colding showed the most undaunted diligence and the most conscientious precision and in 1839 Ørsted engaged Colding to assist on some exacting measurements of the release of heat by compressed water.Christensen (2013) p552 Colding graduated in 1841 and worked as a teacher before being appointed inspector of roads and bridges in Copenhagen in 1845. Colding's importance and influence grew until he was appointed state engineer for Copenhagen in 1857. He oversaw a vast range of public housing, transport, lighting and sanitation projects and gained a high reputation throughout Denmark and internationally. He retired from professional engineering in 1886. Scientific work Colding found time for private scientific work in fluid mechanics, hydrology, oceanography and meteorology as well as electromagnetism and thermodynamics. He was largely responsible for founding the Danish Meteorological Institute in 1872. However, he is best remembered for what he himself termed the \\"principle of imperishability of the forces of nature.\\" Colding was influenced by D'Alembert's principle of \\"lost forces\\", Ørsted, the Naturphilosophie to which Ørsted subscribed and his own religious upbringing.Dahl (1981) p.85 Colding first fulfilled his ambition to work alongside Ørsted, who was conducting experiments on the compressibility of water, in 1839. He summarised this work with a review of other data on compression and friction of various materials in his first published scientific paper.Colding (1843) \\"Nogle saetninger om kraefterne\\" (\\"Theses concerning force\\"), read at the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, published as Colding (1856) In this work, he went on to state that \\"the quantities of heat evolved are, in every case, proportional to the lost moving forces\\" though he did not calculate a mechanical equivalent of heat as Joule was to do in the same year. With Ørsted's support, a further series of quantitative experiments was sponsored by the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, culminating in a report in 1847. By 1850, Colding had obtained a value for the mechanical equivalent of heat, some 14% lowerDahl (1981) p.86 gives only this percentage than the modern value (4.1860 J·cal−1) at a time when Joule had measured 4.159 J·cal−1.Joule, J.P (1850) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 140(1):61-82 A subsequent calculation by Colding in 1852 yielded a value only 3% below modern values.

However, his contributions to meteorology and the built environment of Copenhagen are notable in themselves.

Risk reversal investment strategy A risk-reversal is an option position that consists of being short (selling) an out of the money put and being long (i.e. buying) an out of the money call, both with the same maturity. A risk reversal is a position which simulates profit and loss behavior of owning an underlying security; therefore it is sometimes called a synthetic long. This is an investment strategy that amounts to both buying and selling out-of-money options simultaneously. In this strategy, the investor will first make a market hunch; if that hunch is bullish he will want to go long. However, instead of going long on the stock, he will buy an out of the money call option, and simultaneously sell an out of the money put option. Presumably he will use the money from the sale of the put option to purchase the call option. Then as the stock goes up in price, the call option will be worth more, and the put option will be worth less.http://www.quantprinciple.com/invest/index.php/docs/quant_strategies/riskreversal/ Theory of Risk Reversal Risk reversal (measure of vol-skew) Risk reversal can refer to the manner in which similar out-of-the-money call and put options, usually foreign exchange options, are quoted by finance dealers. Instead of quoting these options' prices, dealers quote their volatility. :R_{25} = \\\\sigma _{call,25} - \\\\sigma _{put,25} In other words, for a given maturity, the 25 risk reversal is the vol of the 25 delta call less the vol of the 25 delta put. The 25 delta put is the put whose strike has been chosen such that the delta is -25%. The greater the demand for an options contract, the greater its price and hence the greater its implied volatility. A positive risk reversal means the implied volatility of calls is greater than the implied volatility of similar puts, which implies a 'positively' skewed distribution of expected spot returns. This is composed of a relatively large number of small down moves along with the possibility of few but relatively large up moves.

However, the bishop has the final say and can theoretically make a decision over the protest of either or both of his counselors. =Stake church membership council= A stake church membership council is convened by the stake president in instances where it appears that a member who has received their temple endowment has committed an offense which may result in withdrawal of membership, or when the subject is a member of a bishop's immediate family. In such instances, the council is composed of the stake president and his two counselors. Attendance of the member's bishop, Relief Society president (for women), or elders quorum president (for men) is optional. The twelve members of the stake high council also participate when there are contested facts, they would add value and balance, the member requests their participation, or a member of the stake presidency or his family is involved. After hearing the evidence in the case and the submissions of the high councilors (if any)—one half of whom speak on behalf of the accused—the stake president and his counselors are encouraged to make a joint, unanimous decision on the outcome. However, the stake president has the final say and can theoretically make a decision over the protest of either or both of his counselors. =Mission membership council= A mission president can convene a church membership council for a full-time missionary within his mission or a member within a district of his mission. He can also authorize branch or district presidents in a district to convene church membership councils. =Common Council of the Church= If the need arises to convene a church membership council for the church's president or one of his counselors in the First Presidency, the Common Council of the Church must be convened by the church's presiding bishop.Doctrine and Covenants 107:73–76. The Common Council is made up of the presiding bishop and his counselors and twelve other high priests selected by the presiding bishop.These twelve could be the members of the Quorum of the Twelve, but there is no requirement that the apostles be selected. The Common Council has only been convened twice: In August 1838, after the return of Zion's Camp, the Council formally convened for the first time to consider charges made by Sylvester Smith against Joseph Smith, who was eventually cleared. In September 1844, Presiding Bishop Newel K. Whitney convened a Common Council which excommunicated Sidney Rigdon, who was the senior surviving member of the First Presidency after the death of Joseph Smith. =Evidence= The council begins by the presiding officer stating the reported misconduct and asking the accused person to admit or deny it. If the person denies the misconduct, the presiding officer or a designee presents the evidence of the misconduct. Evidence may be presented in the form of written or oral statements by witnesses or other documents. An accused person's previous confession cannot be used as evidence in a disciplinary council without the member's consent. The accused member is given a chance to question the witnesses against him or her. After the evidence against the accused is presented, the accused is permitted to present evidence in response. The accused can comment on the evidence and make any other statement he or she wants to make. All witnesses and the accused may also be questioned by any member of the disciplinary council. No witness is placed under oath. Since the disciplinary council is an ecclesiastical court, rules of evidence that govern domestic courts do not apply. If the accused person admits to the conduct in question, no evidence is presented before the council. =Decision= Once a decision has been reached by the church membership council, the decision is announced to the accused person and the presiding officer explains the conditions that are imposed by the decision. The accused is also informed of his or her right to appeal the decision. Other members of the church may be notified of the decision in certain circumstances. =Appeal= An accused member may appeal the decision of the church membership council within 30 days of the decision being made. Appeals of a ward memberhsip council are made to the stake church membership council (i.e. the stake president and his two counselors). An appeal of the decision of a stake or mission church membership council is to the church's First Presidency. An appeal of a decision of a church membership council convened by a branch president or a district president in a mission is to the mission president. The body hearing the appeal may vary the decision of the council in any way or let the original decision stand. =Records= The proceedings of the church membership council are submitted electronically to the office of the First Presidency where the information it contains is permanently stored. It is also reviewed by the body hearing the appeal if an appeal is made. Stake presidents are permitted to request records of past councils for members of their stake from the office of the First Presidency. Bishops may request records of past councils for members of their ward. In the case of withdrawal of membership, the person is removed from church records. Qualifying offencesWhen a church membership council is mandatory= The LDS Church has instructed leaders that a church membership council is mandatory when evidence suggests that a member of the church may have committed any of the following offences against the standards of the church: Murder; rape; sexual assault conviction; child or youth abuse; abuse of a spouse or another adult; predatory behavior (violent, sexual, or financial); incest; child pornography; plural marriage; serious sin while holding a prominent church position; and most felony convictions. =When a church membership council may be appropriate= The LDS Church has instructed leaders that a church membership council may be appropriate when evidence suggests that a member may have committed any of the following offenses against the standards of the church (whether or not a disciplinary council will be held will depend on the facts of the situation and is generally left to the discretion of the bishop or stake president): attempted murder; sexual abuse, including assault and harassment; abuse of a spouse or another adult; adultery, fornication, or same-sex relations; cohabitation, civil unions and partnerships, or same-sex marriage; intensive or compulsive use of pornography that has caused significant harm to a member's marriage or family; robbery, burglary, theft, or embezzlement; perjury; serious sin while holding a position of authority or trust in the church or the community; serious sin that is widely known; abortion; pattern of serious sins; deliberate abandonment of family responsibilities, including nonpayment of child support and alimony; sale of illegal drugs; other serious criminal acts; apostasy; and embezzlement of church funds. =When a membership council is not appropriate= The LDS Church has instructed leaders that church membership councils are not appropriately held to resolve or deal with the following circumstances: inactivity in the church; not fulfilling church duties; not paying tithing; sins of omission; masturbation; not complying with the Word of Wisdom; using pornography, except for child pornography or intensive or compulsive use of pornography that has caused significant harm to a member’s marriage or family; business failures or nonpayment of debts; and civil disputes. Possible outcomes A disciplinary council may reach one of four possible outcomes: #Remain in good standing. This is the result when the church membership council determines that no offense has taken place. However, even if it is determined that an offense did occur, the council may impose no formal action and instead give \\"cautionary council\\" or recommend consultation with the member's bishop for caution or counsel. #Personal counseling with the bishop or stake president and informal membership restriction (formerly known as \\"informal probation\\"). This action temporarily restricts or suspends a member's privileges of church membership in the way specified by the council. Possible actions could include suspending the right to partake of the sacrament, hold a church calling, exercise the priesthood, or enter the temple. #Formal membership restrictions (formerly known as \\"disfellowshipment\\"). A person who has formal membership restrictions is still a member of the Church but is no longer in good standing. A person with a formal membership restriction may not hold a temple recommend, serve in a church calling, or exercise the priesthood. Members under these restrictions may attend public meetings of the church, but may not give a sermon, teach a lesson, offer a public prayer, partake of the sacrament, or vote in sustaining church officers. However, such members may pay tithing and fast offerings and continue to wear the temple garment. If the member expresses repentance and abides by the conditions imposed upon him or her, formal membership restrictions usually last approximately one year. Only a reconvened church membership council can remove the condition of membership restriction. Formal membership restriction is considered a relatively severe action which is adequate for most serious transgressions. #Withdrawal of membership (formerly known as \\"excommunication\\"). An individual whose membership is withdrawn is no longer a member of the LDS Church. All of the restrictions of a formal membership restriction also apply to individuals who have their membership withdrawn. In addition, such a person is not permitted to pay tithing or fast offerings or wear the temple garment. Withdrawal of membership is the most serious sanction a church membership council can impose and is generally reserved for only the most severe offenses. Withdrawal of church membership is mandatory for murder and is almost always required for incest. Withdrawal of membership may also be appropriate for members who have had formal membership restrictions placed upon them and have not repented. Withdrawal of membership almost always lasts at least one year; only a reconvened membership council may approve a person's readmittance to the church through baptism.

Gudrun had been married to the hero Sigurd and with him she had the daughter Svanhild. Svanhild had married the Gothic king Ermanaric (Jörmunrekkr), but betrayed him with the king's son, Randver. Furious Ermanaric hanged his own son and had Svanhild trampled to death by horses. Gudrun wants to avenge her daughter and she agitates her sons Hamdir and Sörli, her sons with King Jonakr by telling them about her fate. They depart for their fateful vengeance, a story that is told in the Hamðismál, the last poem of the Poetic Edda. Sources and historic basis The legend of Jörmunrek appears in the Poetic Edda as Hamðismál and Guðrúnarhvöt. It also appears in Bragi Boddason's Ragnarsdrápa, in the Völsunga saga and in Gesta Danorum. Jordanes wrote in 551 that the Gothic king Ermanaric was upset with the attack of a subordinate king and had his wife Sunilda (i.e. Svanhild) torn to pieces by horses, and as revenge Ermanaric was pierced with spears by her brothers Ammius (Hamdir) and Sarus (Sörli) and died from the wounds. The Annals of Quedlinburg (end of the 10th century) relates that the brothers Hemidus (Hamdir), Serila (Sörli) and Adaccar (Erp/Odoacer) had cut off the hands of Ermanarik.

She led the Red Cross in the United States following its receiving congressional charter in 1905 until World War I, however she did not take up the post of chairman since she believed the organisation would lose credibility with the public. Biography She was born on October 12, 1860, in Cleveland, Ohio to a well-to-do family. Her father, William Jarvis Boardman (15 April 1832 – 2 August 1915), a lawyer and active in politics, was the grandson of the Senator Elijah Boardman. Her mother, Florence Sheffield, was the granddaughter of Joseph Earl Sheffield, who was a major benefactor of Yale University. She had 5 siblings, including Josephine Porter Boardman Crane. The family moved from Ohio to Washington, D.C. in 1887–1888, although they maintained connections to Ohio politics including a friendship with the Taft family. As a socialite, she devoted time to many philanthropies. During the Spanish–American War in 1898 she was active in recruiting nurses. In 1901 she was elected to the Executive Board of the American Red Cross and subsequently led the faction that ousted Clara Barton from the presidency of the organization in 1904. Barton always took personal charge during major disasters. She gave the illusion of efficiency but was unable to build up a staff she trusted, and her fundraising was lackluster. As a result, she was forced out in 1904, when male professional social work experts took control and made it a model of Progressive Era scientific reform.Branden Little. Review of Jones, Marian Moser, The American Red Cross from Clara Barton to the New Deal H-SHGAPE, H-Net Reviews. August, 2013 online The new leader was Boardman; she consulted constantly with senior government officials, military officers, social workers, and financiers. William Howard Taft was especially influential. They imposed a new corporate ethos of \\"managerialism,\\" transforming the agency away from Barton's cult of personality to an \\"organizational humanitarianism\\" ready for expansion along increasingly professional lines.Marian Moser Jones, The American Red Cross from Clara Barton to the New Deal (2013) pp. 117, 137 In 1920, President Woodrow Wilson appointed Boardman to be the first woman member of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia.

He was born in Kobe, and lived in a variety of areas on the island of Shikoku for much of his childhood. He developed a taste for pop music, which eventually led him to study musical arrangement and piano instruction at the Shobi College of Music. He took some time in deciding that music would become his career, but eventually decided to become an arranger, and later a composer. His work has dealt primarily with musical scores for anime. His most well known contributions include music for the Crayon Shin-chan series and music for much of the Pokémon anime series and most of the films in it from 1997 to 2019. His work pulls from many inspirations, among them J-Pop and American pop influences, as well as jazz artist Gil Evans. Many of his compositions utilize string and brass instruments, particularly the french horn. Life Miyazaki was born in Kobe, but moved to the Kamiukena District as a small child. Around the age of 12, he moved to Matsuyama, Ehime. His interest in music began as a child. Both of his parents worked, and often left him with a neighbor during the day. The neighbor's older child listened to pop music on his shortwave radio; Miyazaki would listen as with him, particularly to programs like Billboard. Education Miyazaki received no formal music training until the age of 20, when he entered the Shobi College of Music to study musical composition with a minor in piano education. In order to pass the university entrance exam, he spent a year teaching himself the material. He spent two years studying for the entrance exams required to attend a true university, but never entered one. Career Miyazaki first entertained the thought of making a profession in the music industry after realizing how much the songs he heard on the radio inspired him. When he first became involved with composing works for anime, he worked primarily as an arranger. Miyazaki admits to not playing the piano well, even though composing on it is his job. Style and methods When asked to compose a new piece of music, Miyazaki uses a number of methods, and often works from flashes of inspiration. When deadlines approach and he still has not composed a song, he tries to distract himself by looking at something he finds beautiful or unusual. He draws much of his inspiration from the songs he heard on the radio growing up, and particularly the compositions of Tōru Takemitsu. He listens to the enka and kayōkyoku genres, as well as classical music, jazz, and more general American-style pop music. When he relaxes, he listens to African-American music from the 1960s and 1970s. Other inspirations include Gil Evans and John Williams. Awards The Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers have given Miyazaki the International Award for his song \\"Pocketmonster BGM\\", which was cited as having received a large amount of foreign royalty distribution.

The film is an adaptation of Konami's 1999 video game Silent Hill. It stars Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, Laurie Holden, Deborah Kara Unger, Kim Coates, Tanya Allen, Alice Krige, and Jodelle Ferland.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/silent_hill The film follows Rose, who takes her adopted daughter, Sharon, to the town of Silent Hill, for which Sharon cries while sleepwalking. Arriving at Silent Hill, Rose is involved in a car accident and awakens to find Sharon missing; while searching for her daughter, she fights a local cult while uncovering Sharon's connection to the town's dark past.https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=716 Development of Silent Hill began in the early 2000s. After attempting to gain the film rights to Silent Hill for five years, Gans sent a video interview to them explaining his plans for adapting Silent Hill and how important the games are to him. Konami awarded him the film rights as a result. Gans and Avary began working on the script in 2004. Avary used Centralia, Pennsylvania as an inspiration for the town. Filming began in February 2005 with an estimated $50 million budget and was shot on sound sets and on location in Canada (Brantford, Ontario and Hamilton, Ontario). Silent Hill was released in Canada on April 21, 2006, by Alliance Atlantis and in France on April 26, 2006, by Metropolitan Filmexport and grossing $100 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the film's visuals, set designs, and atmosphere, but criticized the film for its dialogue, plot, and run-time. A sequel entitled Silent Hill: Revelation was released on October 26, 2012 to critical failure, but modest commercial success. Plot Rose Da Silva and her husband Christopher are deeply disturbed by their adopted daughter Sharon's constant sleepwalking and nightmares about Silent Hill, a town in West Virginia that was abandoned 30 years ago due to a massive coal seam fire. Against Christopher's wishes, Rose takes Sharon on a trip to Silent Hill to find answers. Her erratic behaviour concerns police officer, Cybil Bennett. Rose flees from Cybil, but when a girl steps out into the road, Rose crashes and blacks out. Waking up some time later, Rose finds herself in the foggy dimension of Silent Hill and realizes that Sharon is missing. Searching the town for Sharon, Rose pursues the same girl she encountered prior to the crash, who turns out to resemble Sharon. At various points, the town transitions into a nightmarish dimension inhabited by inhuman monsters, including the fearsome Pyramid Head. Cybil catches Rose and tries to arrest her, but then finds out that they are trapped and all the road ends are gone. Rose runs away and is encountered by many other inhuman creatures. Rose survives the transitions and consequently learns of the existence of Alessa Gillespie, a young girl burnt by the Brethren, the town's fanatical cult. Her mother Dahlia wanders the streets as an outcast, guilty for her negligence that led to Alessa's doom. Rose is later joined by Cybil, also trapped in the foggy dimension of the town due to a giant fracture isolating Silent Hill. Meanwhile, in the real world, Christopher searches the abandoned town with policeman Thomas Gucci, but their search is in vain. Upon finding a photo of Alessa, Christopher goes to the orphanage where Sharon was adopted. Gucci appears, revealing he lived in Silent Hill and saved Alessa from the fire. He encourages Christopher to end his futile search and go home. In the Silent Hill dimension, Rose and Cybil explore a hotel the Brethren once used, accompanied by Anna, a Brethren member, where they find the burnt remains of a ceremonial chamber. Rose also encounters the girl, revealed to be an aspect of Alessa. When the town transitions into the dark dimension, Rose, Cybil, and Anna flee to an old church but Pyramid Head emerges and skins Anna alive. Inside, Christabella, the high priestess of the Brethren and Alessa's aunt, suggests a \\"demon\\" knows where Sharon is. Her followers lead Rose and Cybil to a hospital, claiming the demon is in the basement. Christabella sees a photo of Sharon from Rose's locket and brands Rose and Cybil as \\"witches\\" due to Sharon resembling Alessa. Cybil fights the Brethren members but Christabella orders them to violently beat her. Rose enters the basement, but she is barricaded by a group of weapon-wielding nurses who appear to be almost completely blind due to their disfigured, covered faces. Although light and sound attract them, Rose manages to sneak through them, inadvertently startling them into attacking each other. She flees and enters Alessa's room. In a flashback, it is revealed that Alessa was stigmatised by the townspeople for being a bastard. Christabella convinces Dahlia, a formerly devout Brethren member, to \\"purify\\" Alessa, after Alessa is raped by the school janitor while attempting to hide from her tormentors. Christabella immolates Alessa during a ritual but Dahlia realises this and alerts Gucci. They arrive too late as the ritual goes awry, igniting the infamous coal seam fire. Hospitalised, Alessa's rage grew and manifested as Dark Alessa, who is responsible for the shifting dimensions of Silent Hill. Her remaining innocence is later manifested as Sharon, who is taken to the real world to be adopted. Desperate to find Sharon, Rose allows Dark Alessa access to the church by fusing with her body. Meanwhile, Sharon, protected by Dahlia, is captured by the Brethren. In the church, Christabella burns Cybil to death and plans to do the same to Sharon. Rose intervenes and confronts Christabella in regards to her crimes but Christabella stabs her in the heart in retaliation. Rose's blood summons both the original Alessa and Dark Alessa, who bisect and kill Christabella and her followers (excluding Dahlia) with razor wire. Rose rescues Sharon, and, upon seeing Dark Alessa, Sharon and Alessa/Dark Alessa reunite into one body. Rose and Alessa leave the town and return home. When they return home, it is revealed that they are still in the foggy dimension, separated from reality. Meanwhile, Christopher is alone in the real world but discovers that the front door has mysteriously opened.

ProductionDevelopment= Director Christophe Gans attempted for five years to obtain the film rights to the Silent Hill series from Konami. He sent a video interview to them explaining his plans for adapting Silent Hill and how important the games are to him. They were so impressed, he was rewarded with the film rights. In 2004, Gans and screenwriter Roger Avary began writing the script, which would be the first film in a series of Silent Hill films. Silent Hills screenwriter, Roger Avary, used the town of Centralia, Pennsylvania as an inspiration for the town of Silent Hill; Avary commented that as a boy, his father, who was a mining engineer, used to tell him stories about Centralia, where coal deposits from the local mine caught fire and released toxic gases into the town, as well as creating sinkholes when the abandoned mineshafts and coal seams began to collapse. This forced the town to evacuate forever. Avary was fascinated since childhood by the idea that fires underneath the town would be burning for such a long time. When the script was finished, a studio memo was sent to Gans and Avary that voiced concerns about the lack of a male presence in the film, since the original story contained a nearly all female cast. Gans and Avary added Christopher's character (named after Gans) and subplot and the script was approved. Gans described the concept of the town's connection to the child Alessa and the cult: \\"It's a town of people trapped in dark dreams, and she inflicts onto the town what those people did to her body. That is, to me, the meaning of the darkness. The appearance of the town is corrupted in the way that her own flesh was wounded.\\" He furthers expands on Alessa's connection to the alternate reality seen in the film, saying that the alternate reality is \\"in [Alessa's] head\\". \\"It's interesting because the town itself mirrors this fractured psychology—different dimensions, different doubles of the same person.\\" In speaking about the creatures in Silent Hill, Gans said that \\"these monsters are [damned], with the poetic direction of the term: they are a little like the Japanese phantoms, i.e. residues of forgotten feelings as strong as hatred or [guilt].\\" \\"The monsters in the game are not really monsters, but rather a mockery of human beings. The real monsters are the people, the cultists who tortured Alessa. When I approached the film, I knew that it was impossible to represent the monsters as simply beasts that jump on you.\\" The film was greenlit on September 19, 2003. Principal photography commenced on April 25, 2005. It was filmed in both Brantford and Hamilton as well as on soundstages in Toronto in 2005 and on location in Alma College. American studio Sony Pictures bought the distribution rights for $14 million for the United States and Latin America to be released under its TriStar Pictures genre film subsidiary. =Casting= Gans said that casting of Mitchell as the lead for the film is \\"a matter of feeling. If you play Silent Hill you know that each character has a very special poetic quality. They are both twisted and sophisticated. We tried to keep that in mind when we did the casting on this film.\\" Bean's role in the film was originally kept to the beginning and the end of the movie, but due to studio pressure for a male lead, his role was expanded into a subplot. Gans cast Holden after seeing her in The Majestic, stating, \\"in The Majestic, she was beautifully feminine and I cast her so I could show her other side, make her strong and sleek.\\" Gans saw Ferland as \\"the ideal actress\\" after viewing the television show Kingdom Hospital and her screen test for Terry Gilliam's film Tideland. To prepare for her role, Krige read the book The End of Days by Erna Paris, a book about tyranny during the Spanish Inquisition. =Filming= The movie was filmed in the Super 35 film format, except the scenes with the darkness, which were filmed in high- definition video, because of its ability to cleanly capture light and digitally manipulate it in post production. The film contains around 107 different sets specifically used to represent the different versions of the town. The bipedal creatures in the film were played by professional actors or dancers covered in latex and prosthetic makeup. After filming, over 619 visual effects shots were used in the film, with the most prominent uses being the fog that drenches the town, the transitions to darkness, and the insects that surround Pyramid Head. Some of the creatures were also touched up in post- production, with CGI effects such as the burning on the Grey Children, the changes in the dimensions of the Armless creature's legs, the disease that the Janitor spreads, and the barbed wire during Alessa's revenge. In order to maintain the feel of the games, Gans had the sound designer of the original Silent Hill, Akira Yamaoka, flown to the set several times. Additionally, Gans had a 40-inch television brought onto the set, to which he attached a PlayStation 2; Gans then played the original Silent Hill on the system so that the actors and cinematographers could see how Gans wanted to emulate various camera angles and movements. Budgetary concerns caused a few scenes in the film to be rewritten. The meeting of Anna in the film had been envisioned differently. It originally featured Anna being attacked by an injured armless creature, where she is saved by Cybil and Rose. Due to budget concerns, choreographer Roberto Campanella was sent home for the day, and without him the scene did not meet Gans's expectations. To rectify this, the scene was simplified and rewritten. Gans stated that his original vision of the film's finale revolved around six Red Pyramids appearing inside the church, each carrying a different weapon, and slaughtering the cult members in reference to Dante's Inferno. When budgetary and time constraints prevented this ending from being filmed, he created the new ending that revolved around the barbed wire slaying of the cult by Alessa, which was inspired by the erotic anime Legend of the Overfiend. =Soundtrack= The score consists almost entirely of music from Yamaoka's soundtracks to the original four games in the series. The only other piece of music used in the film is Johnny Cash's \\"Ring of Fire\\". Yamaoka's scores were arranged by film composer Jeff Danna, with some tracks appearing in almost identical form to their in-game counterparts, while others were recreated entirely. Release Silent Hill was released to theaters on April 21, 2006 in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Ireland. The film was also released in Australia on August 31, 2006. France, Belgium, Hungary, and Greece also saw April releases. The film was later released in 19 other countries in 2006 which include Russia, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan, and Mexico. The film's poster of a mouthless Alessa was the subject of some vandalism, with many malefactors drawing cartoon mouths (smiling, screaming, sporting vampire fangs, etc.) or placing stickers where her mouth would be. =Home media= On August 22, 2006, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment and TriStar Pictures released the DVD, Blu-ray, and UMD versions of the film in North America.

As of January 3, 2007 the film has grossed $46 million domestically and $97 million total worldwide. At the DVD domestic sales, the film sold 1,316,169 units in 4 weeks, bringing a profit of $22,149,584, and making the total gross of the film jump to $119,757,037 worldwide. Silent Hill has landed in the top 10 highest-grossing film adaptations of video game properties listed on Box Office Mojo (from 1980 to present) at #9, grossing $46,982,632 domestic, just behind Resident Evil: Extinction, which grossed $50,648,679 in domestic box office receipts. =Critical response= Advance screenings of Silent Hill were not given to critics by the distributor. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 31% based on 100 reviews, with an average rating of 4.54/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Silent Hill is visually impressive, but as with many video game adaptations, it's plagued by inane dialogue, a muddled plot, and an overlong runtime.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film a mildly positive review, awarding it two and a half stars out of four. He opined that \\"the film is overlong, with too many unnecessary scenes\\" and that \\"a lot of the movie seems like pointless running around\\", but added that the film \\"looks great\\" and that \\"it packs in a few scary moments and offers a nicely ambiguous conclusion.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times gave the film one and a half stars (out of four), calling it \\"an incredibly good-looking film,\\" but noting that he \\"did not understand the story\\" and criticizing how \\"all through the movie, characters are pausing in order to offer arcane back-stories and historical perspectives and metaphysical insights and occult orientations.\\" Don R. Lewis of Film Threat praised the film's visuals but wrote that \\"this entire film is downright confusing and not in an intriguing way,\\" calling it \\"the best-looking bad film I've ever seen.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a score of D+, stating that \\"a few of the images are startling\\" but \\"Silent Hill is mostly paralyzing in its vagueness.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety opined that \\"above-average interest is generated for a time by [the] elaborate visual package,\\" but \\"in the end, Silent Hill degenerates into an overblown replay of all those Twilight Zone and Stephen King stories in which outsiders stumble upon a time-warped location from which there's no escape.\\" According to Nathan Lee of The New York Times: \\"It begins as a quest, develops into a ghost-town mystery, devolves into a preposterous cautionary tale about witchcraft and religious fundamentalism, and wraps up like the outrageously overwrought fantasy of a movie nerd obsessed with horror who has been given obscene amounts of money to adapt a video game.\\"Nathan Lee, 'Silent Hill' Is a Free Fall Through a Nightmare World, The New York Times, April 22, 2006. Sequel A sequel, Silent Hill: Revelation, taking place six years after the first film's events, was released on October 26, 2012. Christophe Gans could not direct the sequel because he was busy directing an Onimusha film adaptation. Roger Avary was originally attached to write the screenplay and had written the first draft before he was arrested for vehicular manslaughter on November 2010. Michael J. Bassett was later hired to write and direct the sequel. The sequel was panned by critics, holding a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. On the 31st January 2020, Christophe Gans expressed an interest in working on another Silent Hill film.Rourke Keegan, Christophe Gans Announces New Silent Hill Movie And Fatal Frame Movie, Rely on Horror, January 31, 2020.

Cataplexy affects approximately 70% of people who have narcolepsy, and is caused by an autoimmune destruction of hypothalamic neurons that produce the neuropeptide hypocretin (also called orexin), which regulates arousal and has a role in stabilization of the transition between wake and sleep states. Cataplexy without narcolepsy is rare and the cause is unknown. The term cataplexy originates from the Greek κατά (kata, meaning \\"down\\"), and πλῆξις (plēxis, meaning \\"strike\\") and it was first used around 1880 in German physiology literature to describe the phenomenon of tonic immobility also known as \\"playing possum\\". This animal is able to feign death when it is threatened. In the same year the French neuropsychiatrist Jean-Baptiste Gélineau coined the term 'narcolepsy' and published some clinical reports that contain details about two patients who have similar condition as the narcoleptic cases nowadays. Nevertheless the onset reported by him was in adulthood as compared to the nowadays cases reported in childhood and adolescence. Even if he preferred the term ‘astasia’ instead of ‘cataplexy’ the case described by him remained iconic for the full narcoleptic syndrome. Signs and symptoms Cataplexy manifests itself as muscular weakness which may range from a barely perceptible slackening of the facial muscles to complete muscle paralysis with postural collapse. Attacks are brief, most lasting from a few seconds to a couple of minutes, and typically involve dropping of the jaw, neck weakness, and/or buckling of the knees. Even in a full-blown collapse, people are usually able to avoid injury because they learn to notice the feeling of the cataplectic attack approaching and the fall is usually slow and progressive. Speech may be slurred and vision may be impaired (double vision, inability to focus), but hearing and awareness remain normal. Cataplexy attacks are self-limiting and resolve without the need for medical intervention. If the person is reclining comfortably, he or she may transition into sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, or a sleep-onset REM period. While cataplexy worsens with fatigue, it is different from narcoleptic sleep attacks and is usually, but not always, triggered by strong emotional reactions such as laughter, anger, surprise, awe, and embarrassment, or by sudden physical effort, especially if the person is caught off guard. One well known example of this was the reaction of 1968 Olympic long jump medalist Bob Beamon on understanding that he had broken the previous world record by over 0.5 meters (almost 2 feet).Great Olympic Moments - Sir Steve Redgrave, 2011 Cataplectic attacks may occasionally occur spontaneously, with no identifiable emotional trigger. Mechanism In this simplified brain circuit, damage to orexin-secreting neurons in the hypothalamus can lead to inhibition of motor neurons, thus lowering muscle tone. Cataplexy is considered secondary when it is due to specific lesions in the brain that cause a depletion of the hypocretin neurotransmitter. Secondary cataplexy is associated with specific lesions located primarily in the lateral and posterior hypothalamus. Cataplexy due to brainstem lesions is uncommon particularly when seen in isolation. The lesions include tumors of the brain or brainstem and arterio-venous malformations. Some of the tumors include astrocytoma, glioblastoma, glioma, and subependynoma. These lesions can be visualized with brain imaging, however in their early stages they can be missed. Other conditions in which cataplexy can be seen include ischemic events, multiple sclerosis, head injury, paraneoplastic syndromes, and infections such as encephalitis. Cataplexy may also occur transiently or permanently due to lesions of the hypothalamus that were caused by surgery, especially in difficult tumor resections. These lesions or generalized processes disrupt the hypocretin neurons and their pathways. The neurological process behind the lesion impairs pathways controlling the normal inhibition of muscle tone drop, consequently resulting in muscle atonia. =Theories for episodes= A phenomenon of REM sleep, muscular paralysis, occurs at an inappropriate time. This loss of tonus is caused by massive inhibition of motor neurons in the spinal cord. When this happens during waking, the victim of a cataplectic attack loses control of his or her muscles. As in REM sleep, the person continues to breathe and is able to control eye movements. =Hypocretin= The hypothalamus region of the brain regulates basic functions of hormone release, emotional expression and sleep. A study in 2006 in \\"Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine\\" concluded that the neurochemical hypocretin, which is regulated by the hypothalamus, was significantly reduced in study participants with symptoms of cataplexy. Orexin, also known as Hypocretin, is a primary chemical important in regulating sleep as well as states of arousal. Hypocretin deficiency is further associated with decreased levels of histamine and epinephrine, which are chemicals important in promoting wakefulness, arousal and alertness. Diagnosis The diagnosis of narcolepsy and cataplexy is usually made by symptom presentation. Presenting with the tetrad of symptoms (Excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep onset paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, cataplexy symptoms) is strong evidence of the diagnosis of narcolepsy. A Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) is often conducted in order to quantify daytime sleepiness. Treatment Cataplexy is treated with medications. The treatments for narcolepsy and cataplexy can be divided in treatments that act on the excessive daytime sleepiness (ESD) and those which improve the cataplexy. For most of the patients, this will represent a lifelong medication. Nevertheless most of the treatments in humans will act only symptomatically and do not target the loss of the orexin producing neurons. When treating cataplexy, all three systems: adrenergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic must be considered. In the studies made both in vitro and in vivo, it was proven that the adrenergic system can be inhibited by the antidepressants. In the mouse models the cataplexy is regulated by the dopaminergic system via the D2-like receptor, which blocked decreases the cataplexic attacks . The cholinergic system was also observed in the animal models, and it was suggested that stimulations of this system led to severe cataplexy episodes in canine model. There are no behavioral treatments. People with narcolepsy will often try to avoid thoughts and situations that they know are likely to evoke strong emotions because they know that these emotions are likely to trigger cataplectic attacks. =Gamma-hydroxybutyrate= Gamma- hydroxybutyrate (GHB, also known as Sodium oxybate) has been found to be effective at reducing the number of cataplexy episodes. Sodium oxybate is generally safe and is typically the recommended treatment. Sodium oxybate (GHB) is a natural metabolite of GABA. Its main target is the dopaminergic system because at pharmacological concentration it acts as a agonist and modulates the dopamine neurotransmitters and dopaminergic signalling. GHB was used to treat narcolepsy and cataplexy for more than 15 years and it is the only drug authorised by the EMA to treat the whole disease in adults, and by FDA to treat patients who suffer from cataplexy with the indication to be used for combating excessive daytime sleepiness. This drug helps to normalise the sleep architecture pushing the REM sleep toward its normal setting and inhibits the intrusion during the day of its elements like the paralysis in cataplexy. =Antidepressants= If the above treatment is not possible venlafaxine is recommended. Evidence for benefit is not as good . Previous treatments include tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine, clomipramine or protriptyline. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may be used to manage both cataplexy and the REM sleep-onset symptoms of sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. In the clinical practice, venlafaxine (doses 75–225 mg daily) or clomipramine (25–100 mg daily) are the most common antidepressants used to treat cataplexy. If the patient wishes to have a sedative effect then clomipramine is prescribed. The effect of this drugs is to suppress the REM component and to increase the brainstem monoaminergic levels. The venlafaxine is a norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor whereas the clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant. Their effects can be seen within 48 hours after the drug is administrated and at doses smaller than the ones used in depression. Nevertheless the EMA and the FDA do not approve this antidepressants for the treatment of cataplexy. Frequently, tolerance is developed by the patients and typically the risk of cataplexy rebound or “status cataplecticus” appears when their intake is abruptly interrupted. =Future treatments for cataplexy=Immune-based therapies Narcolepsy with cataplexy is considered an autoimmune-mediated disorder, so some therapies based on this hypothesis were developed. The immune-based therapies developed were more or less effective and include: * Corticosteroid: after testing in 1 human and 1 canine case it proved to be ineffective so is less likely to be further used. * Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIgs): it may decrease the symptoms but its effectiveness is still subjective and unconfirmed by the placebo-controlled trials. It was also suggested that sometimes it might have life-threatening side effects. Nevertheless, after giving this treatment to a patient with undetectable orexin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid after only 15 days after the disease onset, the cataplexy was improved and the orexin levels started to normalise. * Plasmapheresis: should be similar with IVIgs but it is more invasive and for it even less data is available. * Immunoadsorption * Alemtuzumab Histaminergic H3 receptor inverse agonist The histaminergic neurons have a very important role in preserving consciousness and in helping maintain wakefulness and remain active during cataplexy. In narcolepsy, there seems to be an increase in these neurons, possibly to compensate for hypocretin loss. A promising therapy would be to increase the activation of histaminergic neurons by an inverse agonist of the histamine H3 receptor, which enhances histamine release in hypothalamus. An inverse agonist of the histamine H3 is Pitolisant. Results after drug testing on animals have indicated increased wakefulness in normal animals, decreased sleepiness and blocked the abnormal transitions from REM sleep to awake state in the hypocretin knock-out mice. Also placebo-controlled studies suggest some positive effects of Pitolisant on cataplexy symptoms increasing the levels of alertness and wakefulness. Research Research is being conducted on hypocretin gene therapy and hypocretin cell transplantation for narcolepsy-cataplexy.

A pianist, organist, conductor, composer, he was also the prolific author of more than 300 film soundtracks. He played for the first time on radio in 1938 with his “013” Big Band, to return on air only after the liberation of Italy in 1944. “013” was the first Italian jazz band to be broadcast in Italy after the fall of Fascism. Early life Piero Piccioni was born in Turin, Piedmont. His mother's maiden name was Marengo, hence his pseudonym Piero Morgan, which he adopted until 1957. When he was growing up, his father Attilio Piccioni (a prominent member of the Italian Christian Democratic Party with the post-war Italian government), would frequently take him to hear concerts at the EIAR Radio Studios in Florence. Having listened to jazz throughout his childhood (he loved the music of Art Tatum and Charlie Parker) and attending studies at the Conservatorio Luigi Cherubini, Piero Piccioni became a musician. Career Piccioni made his radio debut at 17 with his 013 Big Band in 1938, but only returned on air after the liberation of Italy in 1944. His 013 was the first Italian jazz band to be broadcast in Italy after the fall of Fascism. He was influenced in the use of jazz by 20th century classical composers and American films. Directors he liked included Frank Capra, Alfred Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, and John Ford, while Alex North was a film score composer he admired. He began writing songs of his own and was soon able to get some of his works published by Carisch editions. Piero Piccioni came into contact with the movie world in Rome during the fifties, when he was a practicing lawyer securing movie rights for Italian producers such as Titanus and De Laurentiis. During that time, Michelangelo Antonioni had called Piccioni to score a documentary film directed by Luigi Polidoro, one of his apprentices. Piccioni’s first score for a feature film was Gianni Franciolini’s Il mondo le condanna (1952). He consequently changed his lawyer's \\"toga\\" for a conductor's baton. He developed close-knit working relationships with directors Francesco Rosi and Alberto Sordi, and established strong personal and professional bonds with them. Many directors sought Piero Piccioni to score the soundtracks for their films: Francesco Rosi, Mario Monicelli, Alberto Lattuada, Luigi Comencini, Luchino Visconti, Antonio Pietrangeli, Bernardo Bertolucci, Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Lina Wertmuller, Tinto Brass, Dino Risi, and others. His film scores include Il bell'Antonio, Contempt, The 10th Victim, More Than a Miracle, The Deserter, The Light at the Edge of the World, Puppet on a Chain, Lucky Luciano, Camille 2000, The Nun and the Devil, Swept Away, Christ Stopped at Eboli, Fighting Back, and many Alberto Sordi movies. He is credited with over 300 soundtracks and compositions for radio, television, ballets and orchestra. Among his favorite vocalists were female soul singer Shawn Robinson and Edinburgh born Lydia MacDonald. Awards and legacy Piccioni won many prestigious prizes including the David di Donatello Award for the movie Swept Away (1975), Nastro d’argento Award for the movie Salvatore Giuliano by Francesco Rosi (1963), Prix International Lumière 1991, Anna Magnani Award 1975 and Vittorio De Sica Award 1979. His song \\"Traffic Boom\\" was featured as the song for the fictional Logjammin' movie-within-a-movie in The Big Lebowski. The song \\"It's Possible\\" was sampled by DJ Khaled in \\"Jermaine's Interlude\\" on his Major Key album. Death Piccioni died in Rome in 2004.

Early years Martha McChesney Berry was the daughter of Capt. Thomas Berry, a veteran of the Mexican–American War and American Civil War, and Frances Margaret Rhea, a daughter of an Alabama planter. Berry was born on October 7, 1865, in Berry Cove in Jackson County, Alabama, but her family relocated to Rome, Georgia, when she was an infant. Thomas Berry was a partner in Berrys and Company, a wholesale grocery and cotton brokerage business in Rome. Oak Hill, a home of Berry College founder Martha Berry In 1871, he purchased Oak Hill, a working farm on the Oostanaula River, approximately one and one-half miles north of Rome. Miss Berry grew up in this home along with her five sisters, two brothers, and three orphaned cousins. Her early education was conducted through private tutors, and she attended the Edgeworth School, a finishing school in Baltimore, Maryland. This was the only formal education she received. Martha Berry lived at Oak Hill for the remainder of her life. She often came home from these trips with her father, with a lost of a pair of shoes or a hair ribbon. Berry Schools The founding of the Berry Schools was inspired by Berry's desire to help the children of poor landowners and tenant farmers in Georgia who did not have access to quality education. As a consequence of this desire, Martha Berry never married, and she devoted her life to developing the schools that would eventually become Berry College. Berry School, founded by Martha Berry In the late 1890s, she constructed a small, whitewashed school on eighty-three acres of land given to her by her father and began to teach Sunday school classes to local children. She also taught in an abandoned Possum Trot Church, which still stands on the Berry College campus. =Boys' and girls' schools= The Sunday school classes eventually turned into day school activities, and Berry opened a boarding facility for boys called Boys’ Industrial School on January 13, 1902. At the time, Berry had only five boarders, but the need was apparent and in 1909 she opened the Martha Berry School for Girls. Both schools offered high school- level education and were open to those willing to study hard and work for the school. Her teachings focused on the \\"head, heart, and hands\\" of her students: The ability to learn, work and the will to do both well. Her motto, taken from the Gospel of Mark, was and still is the motto of the college \\"Not to be ministered unto but to minister.\\" =Berry College= In 1926, she established Berry Junior College, which in 1930 expanded into a four-year school. Martha Berry died in 1942 and the schools were faced with several years of transition. The Martha Berry School for Girls closed at the end of the 1955–1956 academic year. The boys' high school was renamed Mount Berry School for Boys, and in 1962 it became Berry Academy, which was closed in 1983 when Berry College incorporated. The college now offers one of the country's largest work-study programs, enabling all of its students to work an on campus job for their four years at the school. Berry College also offers scholarships of various types to help its students pay for their education. =Supporters= Martha Berry had many supporters during her lifetime, such as Theodore Roosevelt, Andrew Carnegie, Ellen Louise Axson Wilson (wife of President Woodrow Wilson), and Henry Ford. Ford, in particular, was a generous benefactor to the schools and provided the funds necessary to build the \\"castle\\"-like dormitory complex found at the college. These dormitories are named after Ford's wife and mother, Clara and Mary. Martha Berry is the subject of several biographies: Martha Berry the Sunday Lady of Possum Trot by Tracy Byers, Miracle in the Mountains by Harnett Thomas Kane and Inez Henry Berry College, A History: The Legacy of Martha Berry by Ouida Dickey and Doyle Mathis and A Lady I Loved by Evelyn Hoge Pendley. Legacy  Educators have written that Martha Berry was responsible for the creation of work-study programs grounded in Christian faith that are found throughout the South. Berry certainly put her unique touch upon her school, centering on the maxim that \\"prayer changes things\\". In recognition of Martha Berry's contribution to education, she was inducted into the Georgia Women of Achievement in March 1992 as one of the first five inductees.

Billington in 2001.  Background  In 1995 the First Lady of Texas Laura Bush (a former librarian) founded the Texas Book Festival with Mary Margaret Farabee and other volunteers. The goal of the festival was to honor Texas authors, promote the joys of reading, and benefit the state’s public libraries. The first Texas Book Festival took place in November 1996.  History  As First Lady of the United States, Laura Bush worked with Librarian of Congress James H. Billington to create the National Book Festival. At a news conference announcing the inaugural event Billington said, \\"We must all try, in every way we can, to send the message that reading is critical to our lives and to the life of our nation.\\" The first National Book Festival took place on September 8, 2001 at the Library of Congress and on the east lawn of the U.S. Capitol. The event featured more than 60 award-winning authors, illustrators and storytellers from across the country including Stephen Ambrose, Natalie Babbitt, Robin Cook, Billy Collins, Sue Grafton, Larry L. King, David Levering Lewis, David McCullough, Walter Mosley, Katherine Patterson, Richard Peck, Gary Soto, and Scott Turow. Additional activities included book-signings, musical performances, storytelling, panel discussions, demonstrations of illustration and new technologies. Fifteen NBA players attended as representatives of the National Basketball Association's national reading campaign, \\"Read to Achieve.\\" The first National Book Fair attracted between 25,000 and 30,000 visitors. The 2002 Festival featured more than 70 authors, illustrators and storytellers from across the country and hosted more than 45,000 visitors on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall. A new addition to the Festival was the Pavilion of the States which highlighted regional books. The 2003 National Book Festival attracted a crowd of more than 60,000 to the National Mall. Two new pavilions, Home & Family and Poetry, were added to the event. The 2008 National Book Festival attracted a crowd of more than 120,000 visitors and about 70 well known authors, illustrators and poets. Participating authors included: Tiki Barber, Mary Brigid Barrett, Jan Brett, Geraldine Brooks, Sandra Brown, Dan Chiasson, Eleanor Clift, Philippa Gregory, Steven Kellogg, Katherine Paterson, Salman Rushdie, Bob Schieffer, Jon Scieszka, Alexander McCall Smith, R. L. Stine, and Gordon S. Wood. Laura Bush served as honorary chair of the festival through 2008. From 2009, Barack Obama and Michelle Obama served as honorary co-chairs. After 12 years on the National Mall, the National Book Festival moved indoors to the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in 2014. More than 200,000 people attended the 2013 National Book Festival and following that event, the National Park Service implemented new protocols and requirements to avoid damage to the grass on the National Mall. Stephen Lorenzetti, the Park Service’s deputy superintendent for planning at the National Mall and Memorial Parks, said “There are new procedures to make sure that the grass survives. This can make it more expensive for events to take place... We worked closely with the library to allow the festival to continue at a reasonable cost. We showed them how they might use the walkways and the roadways. But in the end, the library decided that it was more affordable to move to a different venue. We respect their decision.” Jennifer Gavin, project manager of the Library of Congress National Book Festival, confirmed the reason for the change of venue, saying “We spent months working with the Park Service to see if we could make this work... But when we looked at the costs — and they were considerable — we decided that the festival-goers would be better served by moving it into the convention center.” The move indoors allowed the Festival to expand into nighttime events, cookbook demonstrations, and screenings of film adaptions of books. The Literary Director currently in charge of all programming of the Festival is author Marie Arana, former editor in chief of Book World at the Washington Post and now Literary Director of the Library of Congress.

Guðrúnarkviða I or the First Lay of Guðrún is simply called Guðrúnarkviða in Codex Regius, where it is found together with the other heroic poems of the Poetic Edda. Henry Adams Bellows considered it to be one of the finest of the eddic poems with an \\"extraordinary emotional intensity and dramatic force\\". It is only in this poem that Gjúki's sister Gjaflaug and daughter Gollrönd are mentioned, and the only source where Herborg, the queen of the Huns, appears. The Guðrún lays show that the hard-boiled heroic poetry of the Poetic Edda also had a place for the hardships of women.The article Gudrunarkvida in Nationalencyklopedin. Bellows considers it to be one of the oldest heroic lays and with very few Scandinavian additions. Brynhild's only role is the cause of Sigurd's death and Guðrún's enemy. Alfred Tennyson's poem Home They Brought Her Warrior Dead was inspired by Benjamin Thorpe's translation of the lay. Synopsis Guðrún sat beside her dead husband, Sigurð, but she did not weep with tears like other women, although her heart was bursting with grief. A prose section informs that Guðrún had had a taste of Fafnir's heart from Sigurð and could understand the song of birds. Bellows notes that this information serves no purpose in the poem, but that the Völsunga saga also mentions that she had eaten some of Fafnir's heart, after which she was both wiser and grimmer. In order to show sympathy and to console her, both jarls and their spouses came to Guðrún to tell her that they too carried great sorrow in their lives. Her aunt Gjaflaug (Gjúki's sister) told her that she had lost five husbands, two daughters, three sisters and eight brothers, but still carried on living.Bellows notes that Gjaflaug and the losses that she reports of the Gjukung clan are mentioned nowhere else and she may be an addition by the poet. Herborg,Bellows finds it spurious that a queen of the Huns would have showed herself at the Burgundian court. the queen of the Huns, told her that she had lost her husband and seven of her sons in the south. She had also lost her father, mother and four brothers at sea. She had buried all of them with her own hands, and there was no one to console her. Within the same six months, the queen had even been taken as war booty and had had to bind the shoes of a queen who beat her and abused her. The king was the best lord she had ever known and his queen the worst woman.Bellows suggests that the queen had been rightly jealous and later replaced as queen by Herborg. Herborg's foster-daughter, and Guðrún's sister, GollröndBellows notes that Gollrönd only appears in this poem. had Sigurð's corpse unveiled and she put Sigurð's head on Guðrún's knees. Gullrönd asked Guðrún to kiss Sigurd as if he were still alive. Guðrún bent over Sigurð's head with his clotted hair and her tears began to run like raindrops. Gullrönd said that Guðrún's and Sigurð's love was the greatest one she had ever seen. Her sister then answered that Sigurð was a greater man than their brothers and that Sigurð had found her a higher lady than the Valkyries: She then turned towards her brothers talking of their crime, and she cursed her brothers that their greed for Fafnir's gold would be their undoing.This curse would be fulfilled in the following poems. Like Sigurðarkviða hin skamma, stanza 16, this poem shows that one of the motives for killing Sigurð was Fafnir's gold. This motive was also part of the German tradition appearing in the Nibelungenlied. She then directed her words against Brynhildr and said that their home was happier before she appeared. Brynhildr, who was present, responded that Guðrún's sister Gollrönd was a witch who had made Guðrún's tears flow and used magic to make her speak. Gullrönd retorted that Brynhildr was a hated woman who had brought sorrow to seven kings and made many women lose their love. Brynhildr then answered by putting the blame on her brother Atli (Attila the Hun), because he had forced her to marry Gunnar against her will.Bellows suggests that the poet derived this version from Sigurðarkviða hin skamma, stanzas 32-39. These stanzas represent a different version of the story, where Atli was attacked by Gunnar and Sigurd and bought them off by giving them his sister Brynhildr. In this version Atli would have lied to Brynhildr that Gunnar was Sigurd, and according to Bellows this version is supported by the interchange of forms that is described in the Völsunga saga and in Grípisspá (stanzas 37-39). In this poem, Atli forced her to marry Gunnar out of desire for Sigurð's treasure. The last stanza dwells on Brynhild's anger: The lay ends with a prose section which tells that Guðrún went into the wilderness and travelled to Denmark where she stayed for three years and a half with Thora, the daughter of Hakon.According to Bellows, Thora and Hakon have never been conclusively identified with other characters in Scandinavian legend. Referring to Sigurðarkviða hin skamma, the prose section ends by telling that Brynhildr would soon take her own life with a sword after having killed eight of her thralls and five of her maids in order to take them with her.

Illustration on a Faroese stamp by Anker Eli Petersen. Guðrúnarkviða II, The Second Lay of Gudrún, or Guðrúnarkviða hin forna, The Old Lay of Gudrún is probably the oldest poem of the Sigurd cycle, according to Henry Adams Bellows. The poem was composed before the year 1000 and Bellows considered it to be in a \\"rather bad shape\\", but it was in that shape that it provided material for the Völsunga saga, where it was faithfully paraphrased. He states, however, that it is the only Old Norse poem from an earlier period than the year 1000 in the Sigurd tradition that has come down to modern times in a roughly complete form. The other older poems, Reginsmál, Fáfnismál and Sigrdrifumál, are collections of fragments and only the last part of Brot af Sigurðarkviðu remains. The remaining poems in the cycle are generally dated to the 11th century and the 12th century. Bellows states that another reason for assuming that the poem derives from a lament originating in Germany is the fact that Sigurd's death takes place in the forest, as in the Nibelungenlied, and not in his bed. Other elements relating closely to the German tradition are her mother and her brother insisting that she marry Atli, the slaying of the Gjukungs and her future revenge on Atli. Synopsis King Þjóðrekr was staying at the court of Atli, and Þjóðrekr had just lost most of his warriors in battle.Bellows comments that Þjóðrekr is the famous Theodoric the Great, the king of the Ostrogoths who would become famous in German legends as Dietrich von Bern. In German heroic legends, it was early accepted to bring together Attila (Etzel, Atli), who died in 453 with Theodoric who was born c. 455, and in addition make them the contemporaries with Ermanaric who died c. 376. In German legends, Ermanaric took the place of Theodoric's actual enemy Odovakar. It is in battle with Ermanaric/Odovakar that Þjóðrekr has lost most of his men in this poem. Þjóðrekr and Atli's queen Guðrún were alone together and discussed their sorrows.Compare with Guðrúnarkviða III, where Guðrún is accused of having been unfaithful with Þjóðrekr during this meeting. Guðrún told Þjóðrekr that she was a young maiden when her father Gjúki gave her away to Sigurd with a dowry of gold. Then her brothers murdered her hero Sigurd: Guðrún held the rein of the horse and began to cry, as she understood what had happened:In the end section of Brot af Sigurðarkviðu, the annotator is troubled by the existence of two versions of Sigurd's death and refers to the authority of \\"German men\\" for the version that Sigurd was murdered in the forest. The alternative version in which Sigurd is murdered in his bed appears in Sigurðarkviða hin skamma, Guðrúnarhvöt, Hamðismál and in the Völsunga saga. In the Völsunga saga, his brother-in-law Guthormr tried to kill him twice. The first time, he failed because he was terrified by the brightness of Sigurd's eyes, and so he had to wait until Sigurd had fallen asleep. The correctness of the annotator in referring to Germans for the version that Sigurd was killed in the forest is shown by the Nibelungenlied and the Þiðrekssaga. When she met her brothers, Gunnarr was bowing his head, but Högni told her the news that Sigurd had been slain, but that he had taken their brother Guthormr with him.Bellows notes that this shows that the mortally wounded Sigurd killed his murderer Guthormr in both versions of his death. He further told her that she could find Sigurd on the southern road where she would hear the cry of ravens and howling wolves. Guðrún went into the forest to search for what was left by the wolves and found Sigurd. When she found Sigurd, Guðrún did not cry, wail or wring her hands,Compare Guðrúnarkviða I. although she was so sad that she did not want to live anymore. She left the mountains and travelled for five days, until she saw the hall of Halfr, in Denmark, where she stayed for three and a half years with Thora, the daughter of Hakon.Bellows renders Halfr as Hoalf and refers to a theory that Hoalf is identical to Àlfr, the son of Hjalprekr, and the second husband of Sigurd's mother Hjördis. A Thora appears in Hyndluljóð, as the wife of Dagr, one of the sons of Halfdan the Old and the mother of an Àlfr (this Halfr?). Thora and Guðrún enjoyed themselves by weaving tapestries of southern halls, Danish swans and warriors: Her mother GrimhildGrimhild is called the queen of the Goths. Similarly, her son Gunnar is called lord of the Goths in Grípisspá. Bellows notes that Goth could be used to refer to any south Germanic people. asked her sons Gunnarr and Högni what kind of wergild they would like to give their sister for the killing of her husband Sigurd and her son Sigmund, and they were both ready to compensate their sister.Bellows comments here that Atli threatens to declare war on the Burgundians, if they don't give him Guðrún as wife. Guðrún met her mother, brothers and Valdar, the king of Denmark, and three men named Jarizleif, Eymoth and Jarizskar.Bellows comments that the names Jarizleif, Eymoth and Jarizskar, two of which are apparently Slavic, appear to be added as the names of Atli's messengers. They are described by the poem either as \\"long-beards\\" or Lombards, but their names fit neither Huns nor Lombards. According to Bellows, the Völsunga saga and some commentators interpret this meeting as taking place in Denmark, but Bellows finds it more likely that a line had dropped out and that she met the messengers at her brothers' place. They wanted to give her gifts to console her but she did not trust them. Then, her mother gave her a something to drink, a potion of forgetfulness:In one version of the story, she also gave this potion to Sigurd. Bellows comments that the potion does not seem to have worked. The poem relates that Guðrún forgot and the three kingsBellows comments that the three kings are probably Atli's messengers, but that they may also be Gunnar, Högni and the unnamed brother who seems to appear in Sigurðarkviða hin skamma. kneeled before her and Grimhildr began to speak. Her mother told her that she gave her all her father's wealth, and that she would also have Buðli's wealth because she was to become Atli's wife. Guðrún answered that she did not wish to marry Atli, but her mother responded that with Atli she would be as happy as if both Sigurd and her son Sigmund were still alive. Furthermore, if she did not marry Atli, she would live without husband for the rest of her life. Guðrún responded that her mother should not be so eager to giver her away to the Huns, and she prophesied that Atli would kill Gunnarr and tear out the heart of Högni. Grímhildr began to weep when she heard the prophecy and told Guðrún that she was forced to give her away to Atli. Guðrún then continued her lament by telling that she married Atli for her kinsmen's sake. She was never happy with Atli and she lost her sons when her brothers died,This refers to Guðrún's revenge as told in Dráp Niflunga when she avenged her brothers' death by killing her and Atli's sons Erpr and Eitil. and she would kill Atli. She travelled to Atli first a week through cold lands, then a week on water and lastly a week through land that lacked water.Bellows comments that various unsuccessful efforts have been made to trace this journey from Worms, in Germany, and down the Danube. They arrived to high walls and guardians opened the gates. Bellows comments that there appears to be a large lacuna following her arrival to Atli. He adds that the ending of the lament appears to have been replaced another poem, because it deals with how Atli told Guðrún that he had had foreboding dreams of being killed by her. The description of the dream begins with this stanza: Without understanding the meaning of the dream, Atli describes his future eating of his own sons, served to him by their own mother Guðrún, in revenge for Atli's killing her brothers. There the poem ends in a few cryptic lines where Guðrún says that people will talk of a sacrifice.

It has not left any traces in Völsunga saga and was probably not known by its compilers. It is dated to the early 11th century, because that was the time when the ordeal by boiling water made its appearance in Scandinavia and the poet speaks of it as a practice of foreign origin. According to Henry Adams Bellows, the poem is based on material that came from northern Germany, where the ordeal by boiling water had long been current. He adds that it has so little local colour that it was probably composed based on a story that the poet had heard from a German. The Guðrún lays show that the hard-boiled heroic poetry of the Poetic Edda also had a place for the hardships of women.The article Gudrunarkvida in Nationalencyklopedin.

During the Vietnam War (1955-1975) it became important as the battleground demarcation separating North from South Vietnamese territories. The zone ceased to exist with the reunification of Vietnam on 2 July 1976, though the area remains dangerous due to the numerous undetonated explosives it contains. Geography Photo taken from the north side of the DMZ at the Route 1 crossing. The guard tower on the left is a re-creation and spires seen in the distance through the arch are a new monument. The border between North and South Vietnam was 47.3 miles in length and ran from east to west near the centre of present-day Vietnam within Quảng Trị Province. Beginning in the west at the tripoint with Laos, it ran east in a straight line until reaching the village of Bo Ho Su on the Bến Hải River. The line then followed this river as it flowed in a broadly north-eastwards direction out to the Gulf of Tonkin. Either side of the line was a Demilitarized Zone, forming a buffer of about 4-6 miles in width. Although it was nominally described as being at \\"the 17th parallel,\\" the border never actually followed that line, only straddling the general area of that line of longitude. History The Demilitarized Zone between North and South Vietnam, March 1968, looking west toward Laos. The First Indochina War (also called the French Indochina War) was fought in French Indochina from 1946 to 1954 between France and the French-controlled State of Vietnam on the one side, and the Communist-dominated independence movement the Viet Minh (aided by China and the USSR) on the other. The Viet Minh won the war, gaining effective control of all northern Vietnam except an enclave around Hanoi. On 21 July 1954, the Republic of France gave up its control of Vietnam, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was recognized as the government of northern Vietnam by France while \\"recognizing\\" the State of Vietnam as the government of southern Vietnam at the same time. The post- colonial conditions of Vietnam were set at the Geneva Conference of 1954 and an agreement was finalized on July 21, 1954. The agreement reflected the military situation on the ground: the northern part of Vietnam, which was almost entirely controlled by the Viet Minh, became the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, under Communist leader Ho Chi Minh, whilst the southern part of Vietnam, where the Viet Minh controlled only relatively small and remote areas, became the independent State of Vietnam under Bảo Đại, the last scion of the old Vietnamese imperial house. The State of Vietnam later became the Republic of Vietnam. A temporary boundary running primarily along the Bến Hải River was established pending elections, with the area on either side of the border declared a demilitarized zone - troops of both governments were barred from this area. War between North and South broke out in 1950s and the DMZ hardened into a de facto international boundary, with the war evolving into a proxy conflict of the Cold War and thousands of American troops being sent to the country. Despite the DMZ's supposed status, 3rd Marine Division intelligence estimated that the combat strength of NVA and Viet Cong forces in the DMZ area in January 1968 was 40,943 troops.Pike, COL Thomas F., Military Records, February 1968, 3rd Marine Division: The Tet Offensive, p. 115, . NVA and VC Order of Battle information is located on pages 114-127 The north was ultimately victorious in the war in 1975, and the DMZ ceased to exist following the reunification of Vietnam on 2 July 1976.

The town was conceived initially as a penal colony for British convicts sent from Sydney. Its suitability for fishing, farming, timbering, and other occupations, however, caused it to be opened to free settlement in 1838. The town became a municipality in 1859 and a consolidated metropolitan area in 1924. Brisbane encountered major flooding disasters in 1893, 1974 and 2011. Significant numbers of US troops were stationed in Brisbane during World War II. The city hosted the 1982 Commonwealth Games, World Expo 88, and the 2014 G20 Brisbane summit.  Etymology  Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, is named for Sir Thomas Brisbane (1773–1860), British soldier and colonial administrator born in Ayrshire, Scotland. Sir Thomas Brisbane was Governor of New South Wales at the time that Brisbane was named.  Aboriginal history  Prior to European colonisation, the Brisbane region was occupied by Aboriginal tribes, notably clans of the Yugara, Turrbal and Quandamooka peoples. The oldest archeological site in the Brisbane region comes from Wallen Wallen Creek on North Stradbroke Island (21,430±400 years before present), however, settlement would likely occurred well prior to this date. The land, the river and its tributaries were the source and support of life in all its dimensions. The river's abundant supply of food included fish, shellfish, crab, and prawns. Good fishing places became campsites and the focus of group activities. The district was defined by open woodlands with rainforest in some pockets or bends of the Brisbane River. A resource-rich area and a natural avenue for seasonal movement, Brisbane was a way station for groups travelling to ceremonies and spectacles. The region had several large (200–600 person) seasonal camps, the biggest and most important located along waterways north and south of the current city heart: Barambin or 'York's Hollow' camp (today's Victoria Park) and Woolloon- cappem (Woolloongabba/South Brisbane), also known as Kurilpa. These camping grounds continued to function well into historic times, and were the basis of European settlement in parts of Brisbane.  European exploration  The region was first explored by Europeans in 1799, when Matthew Flinders explored Moreton Bay during his expedition from Port Jackson north to Hervey Bay. He made a landing at what is now Woody Point in Redcliffe, and also touched down at Coochiemudlo Island and Pumicestone Passage. During the fifteen days he spent in Moreton Bay, Flinders was unable to find the Brisbane River. A permanent settlement in the region was not founded until 1823, when New South Wales Governor Thomas Brisbane was petitioned by free settlers in Sydney to send their worst convicts elsewhere and the area chosen became the city of Brisbane. On 23 October 1823, Surveyor General John Oxley set out with a party in the cutter Mermaid from Sydney to \\"survey Port Curtis (now Gladstone), Moreton Bay, and Port Bowen (north of Rockhampton, ), with a view to forming convict settlements there\\". The party reached Port Curtis on 5 November 1823. Oxley suggested that the location was unsuitable for a settlement, since it would be difficult to maintain. As he approached Point Skirmish by Moreton Bay, he noticed several Indigenous Australians approaching him and in particular one as being \\"much lighter in colour than the rest\\". The white man turned out to be a shipwrecked timbergetters by the name of Thomas Pamphlett who, along with John Finnegan, Richard Parsons, and John Thompson had left Sydney on 21 March 1823 to sail south along the coast and bring cedar from Illawarra but during a large storm were pushed north. Not knowing where they were, the group attempted to return to Sydney, eventually being shipwrecked on Moreton Island on 16 April.Field's New South Wales p. 89 (published 1925) see footnote They lived with the Indigenous tribe for seven months. After meeting with them, Oxley proceeded approximately up what he later named the Brisbane River in honour of the governor. Oxley explored the river as far as what is now the suburb of Goodna in the city of Ipswich, about upstream Brisbane's central business district. Several places were named by Oxley and his party, including Breakfast Creek (at the mouth of which they cooked breakfast), Oxley Creek, and Seventeen Mile Rocks.  1824 colony  Captain Patrick Logan was the commandment of Moreton Bay from 1826-1830. Known as the Fell Tyrant, his death was celebrated by The Convict's Lament In 1824, the first convict colony was established at Redcliffe Point under Lieutenant Henry Miller. Meanwhile, Oxley and Allan Cunningham explored further up the Brisbane River in search of water, landing at the present location of North Quay. Only one year later, in 1825, the colony was moved south from Redcliffe to a peninsula on the Brisbane River, site of the present central business district, called \\"Meen-jin\\" by its Turrbal inhabitants. At the end of 1825, the official population of Brisbane was \\"45 males and 2 females\\". Until 1859, when Queensland was separated from the state of New South Wales, the name Moreton Bay was used to describe the new settlement and surrounding areas. \\"Edenglassie\\" was the name first bestowed on the growing town by Chief Justice Francis Forbes, a portmanteau of the two Scottish cities Edinburgh and Glasgow. The name soon fell out of favour with many residents and the current name in honour of Governor Thomas Brisbane was adopted instead. The colony was originally established as a \\"prison within a prison\\"—a settlement, deliberately distant from Sydney, to which recidivist convicts could be sent as punishment. It soon garnered a reputation, along with Norfolk Island, as one of the harshest penal settlements in all of New South Wales. In July 1828 work began on the construction of the Commissariat Store. It remains intact today as a museum of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland and is only one of two convict era buildings still standing in Queensland. The other is The Old Windmill on Wickham Terrace. Over twenty years, thousands of convicts passed through the penal colony. Hundreds of these fled the stern conditions and escaped into the bush. Although most escapes were unsuccessful or resulted in the escapees perishing in the bush, some (e.g. James Davis) succeeded in living as \\"wild white men\\" amongst the aboriginal people. During these decades, the local aboriginals tried to \\"starve out\\" the settlement by destroying its crops—most notably their \\"corn fields\\" at today's South Bank. In retaliation, colony guards shot and killed aboriginals entering the corn fields.  Free settlement  Great fire of Brisbane in 1864 As a penal colony, Brisbane did not permit the erection of private settlements nearby for many years. As the inflow of new convicts steadily declined, the population dropped. From the early 1830s the British government questioned the suitability of Brisbane as a penal colony. Allan Cunningham's discovery of a route to the fertile Darling Downs in 1828, the commercial pressure to develop a pastoral industry, and increasing reliance on Australian wool, as well as the expense of transporting goods from Sydney, were the major factors contributing to the opening of the region to free settlement. In 1838, the area was opened up for free settlers, as distinct from convicts. An early group of Lutheran missionaries from Germany were granted land in what is now the north side suburb of Nundah. In 1839 the first three surveyors, Dixon, Stapylton and Warner arrived in Moreton Bay to prepare the land for greater numbers of European settlers by compiling a trigonometrical survey. From the 1840s, settlers took advantage of the abundance of timber in local forests. Once cleared, land was quickly utilized for grazing and other farming activities. The convict colony eventually closed. The free settlers did not recognise local aboriginal ownership and were not required to provide compensation to the Turrbal aboriginals. Some serious affrays and conflicts ensued—most notably resistance activities of Yilbung, Dundalli, Ommuli, and others. Yilbung, in particular, sought to extract regular rents from the white population on which to sustain his people, whose resources had been heavily depleted by the settlers. By 1869, many of the Turrbal had died from gunshot or disease, but the Moreton Bay Courier makes frequent mention of local indigenous people who were working and living in the district. In fact, between the 1840s and 1860s, the settlement relied increasingly on goods obtained by trade with aboriginals—firewood, fish, crab, shellfish—and services they provided such as water-carrying, tree-cutting, fencing, ring- barking, stock work and ferrying. Some Turrbal escaped the region with the help of Thomas Petrie, who gave his name to the suburb of Petrie in the Moreton Bay region north of Brisbane.  Development in the early years of the colony of Queensland  On 6 September 1859, the Municipality of Brisbane was proclaimed. The next month, polling for the first council was conducted. John Petrie was elected the first mayor of Brisbane. Queensland was formally established as a self-governing colony of Great Britain, separate from New South Wales, in 1859. Great Flood of 1893 Unlike Sydney during the 1860s and 1870s, Brisbane had few professional artists and no art gallery. Originally the neighbouring city of Ipswich was intended to be the capital of Queensland, but it proved to be too far inland to allow access by large ships, so Brisbane was chosen instead. The first jacaranda tree grown in Australia was planted at the City Botanic Gardens in 1864. View of Queen Street, 1895 The 1893 Black February floods caused severe flooding in the region and devastated the city. Raging flood waters destroyed the first of several versions of the Victoria Bridge. Even though gold was discovered north of Brisbane, around Maryborough and Gympie, most of the proceeds went south to Sydney and Melbourne. The city remained an underdeveloped regional outpost, with comparatively little of the classical Victorian architecture that characterized southern cities. A demonstration of electric lighting of lamp posts along Queen Street in 1882 was the first recorded use of electricity for public purposes in the world. The first railway in Brisbane was built in 1879, when the line from the western interior was extended from Ipswich to Roma Street Station. First horse-drawn, then electric trams operated in Brisbane from 1885 until 1969. In 1887, the Yungaba Immigration Centre was established at Kangaroo Point. The two-storey brick building is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. The Local Authorities Act 1902 introduced the ability of a town to be designated a city with Brisbane being officially designated as one of the first three cities by the Act (the others being Rockhampton and Townsville). Tramway employees stood down for wearing union badges on 18 January 1912 sparked Australia's first General strike, the 1912 Brisbane General Strike which lasted for five weeks. The first ceremony to honour the fallen soldiers at Gallipoli was held at St John's Cathedral on 10 June 1915. The tradition would later grow into the popular Anzac Day ceremony. View of Queen's Gardens, 1910 Demonstration in Albert Square during the 1912 Brisbane general strike In an effort to prevent overcrowding and control urban development, the Parliament of Queensland passed the Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885, preventing congestion in Queensland cities relative to others in Australia. This legislation, in addition to the construction of efficient public transport in the form of steam trains and electric trams, encouraged urban sprawl. Although the initial tram routes reached out into established suburbs such as West End, Fortitude Valley, New Farm, and Newstead, later extensions and new routes encouraged housing developments in new suburbs, such as the western side of Toowong, Paddington, Ashgrove, Kelvin Grove and Coorparoo. This pattern of development continued through to the 1950s, with later extensions encouraging new developments around Stafford, Camp Hill, Chermside, Enoggera and Mount Gravatt. Generally, these new train lines linked established communities, although the Mitchelton line (later extended to Dayboro) and before being cut back to Ferny Grove) did encourage suburban development out as far as Keperra. Subsequently, as private motor cars became affordable, land between tram and train routes was developed for settlement, resulting in the construction of Ekibin, Tarragindi, Everton Park, Stafford Heights, and Wavell Heights. Shrine of Remembrance, 1932 Corner of Queen and Edward streets, 1932 = Amalgamation of local government areas = In 1924, the City of Brisbane Act was passed by the Queensland Parliament, consolidating the City of Brisbane and the City of South Brisbane; the Towns of Hamilton, Ithaca, Sandgate, Toowong, Windsor, and Wynnum; and the Shires of Balmoral, Belmont, Coorparoo, Enoggera, Kedron, Moggill, Sherwood, Stephens, Taringa, Tingalpa, Toombul, and Yeerongpilly to form the current City of Greater Brisbane, now known simply as the City of Brisbane, in 1925. To accommodate the new, enlarged city council, the current Brisbane City Hall was opened in 1930. Many former shire and town halls were then remodelled into public libraries, becoming the nucleus of Greater Brisbane's branch system. During the Great Depression, a number of major projects were undertaken to provide work for the unemployed, including the construction of the William Jolly Bridge and the Wynnum Wading Pool.  Brisbane during the Second World War  Arrival of United States sailors in 1941 Lockheed Lightning fighter aircraft flies over the city during World War II Due to Brisbane's proximity to the South West Pacific Area theatre of World War II, the city played a prominent role in the defence of Australia. The city became a temporary home to thousands of Australian and American servicemen. Buildings and institutions around Brisbane were given over to the housing of military personnel as required. The present-day MacArthur Central building became the Pacific headquarters of U.S. General Douglas MacArthur, and the University of Queensland campus at St Lucia was converted to a military barracks for the final three years of the war. St Laurence's College and Somerville House Girls' School in South Brisbane were also used by American forces. During this time St Laurence's College was moved to Greenslopes to continue classes. Newstead House was also used to house American servicemen during the war. Because US authorities wanted separate recreational facilities black soldiers the Red Cross organised dances at the Doctor Carver Club in South Brisbane. Brisbane was used to mark the position of the \\"Brisbane Line\\", a controversial defence proposal allegedly formulated by the Menzies government, that would, upon a land invasion of Australia, surrender the entire northern part of the country. The line was, allegedly, at a latitude just north of Brisbane and spanned the entire width of the continent. Surviving from this period are several cement bunkers and gun forts in the northern suburbs of Brisbane and adjacent areas (Sunshine Coast/ Moreton Bay islands). On 26 November and 27 November 1942, rioting broke out between US and Australian servicemen stationed in Brisbane. By the time the violence had been quelled one Australian soldier was dead, and hundreds of Australian and US servicemen were injured along with civilians caught up in the fighting. Hundreds of soldiers were involved in the rioting on both sides. This incident, which was heavily censored at the time and apparently was not reported in the US at all, is known as the Battle of Brisbane.  Post-War Brisbane  Immediately after the war, the Brisbane City Council, along with most governments in Australia, found it difficult to raise finances for much-needed repairs and development. Even where funds could be obtained materials were scarce. Adding to these difficulties was the political environment encouraged by some aldermen, led by Archibald Tait, to reduce the city's rates (land taxes). Ald Tait successfully ran on a slogan of \\"Vote for Tait, he'll lower the rate.\\" Rates were indeed lowered, exacerbating Brisbane's financial difficulties. Although Brisbane's tram system continued to be expanded, roads and streets remained unsealed. Water supply was limited, although the City Council built and subsequently raised the level of the Somerset Dam on the Stanley River. Despite this, most residences continued to rely heavily on rainwater stored in tanks. The limited water supply and lack of funding also meant that despite the rapid increase in the city's population, little work was done to upgrade the city's sewage collection, which continued to rely on the collection of nightsoil. Other than the CBD and the innermost suburbs, Brisbane was a city of \\"thunderboxes\\" (outhouses) or of septic tanks. What finances could be garnered by the Council were poured into the construction of Tennyson Powerhouse, and the extension and upgrading of the powerhouse in New Farm Park to meet the growing demands for electricity. Brisbane's first modern apartment building, Torbreck at Highgate Hill, was completed in 1960. Work continued slowly on the development of a town plan, hampered by the lack of experienced staff and a continual need to play \\"catch-up\\" with rapid development. The first town plan was adopted in 1965. 1961 saw the election of Clem Jones as Lord Mayor. Ald Jones, together with the town clerk J.C. Slaughter sought to fix the long-term problems besetting the city. Together they found cost-cutting ways to fix some problems. For example, new sewers were laid 4 feet deep and in footpaths, rather than 6 feet deep and under roads. In the short term, \\"pocket\\" or local sewerage treatment plants were established around the city in various suburbs to avoid the expense of developing a major treatment plants and major connecting sewers. They were also fortunate in that finance was becoming less difficult to raise and the city's rating base had by the 1960s significantly grown, to the point where revenue streams were sufficient to absorb the considerable capital outlays. Under Jones' leadership, the City Council's transport policy shifted significantly. The City Council hired American transport consultants Wilbur Smith to devise a new transport plan for the city. They produced a report known as the Wilbur Smith \\"Brisbane Transportation Study\\" which was published in 1965. It recommended the closure of most suburban railway lines, closure of the tram and trolley-bus networks, and the construction of a massive network of freeways through the city. Under this plan the suburb of Woolloongabba would have been almost completely obliterated by a vast interchange of three major freeways. Although the trams and trolley-buses were rapidly eliminated between 1968 and 1969, only one freeway was constructed, the trains were retained and subsequently electrified. The first train line to be so upgraded was the Ferny Grove to Oxley line in 1979. The train line to Cleveland, which had been cut back to Lota in 1960, was also reopened. = Brisbane floods = Brisbane has been inundated by severe floods of the Brisbane River in 1864, 1893, 1897, 1974, 2011 and 2013. A comprehensive flood mitigation scheme was instituted for the Brisbane River catchment area in the aftermath of the 1974 flood. Since then the city remained largely flood free, until the floods in January 2011 and 2013 floods. = 1980s = The 1982 Commonwealth Games was officially opened by The Duke of Edinburgh and closed by The Queen. Brisbane hosted the Commonwealth Games in 1982 and the World's Fair in 1988. Between the late 1970s and mid-1980s, Brisbane was the focus of early land rights protests (e.g. during the Commonwealth Games) and several well-remembered clashes between students, union workers, police and the then-Queensland government. Partly from this context, innovative Brisbane music groups emerged (notably Punk groups) that added to the city's renown. Later in that decade, emission control regulation had a major effect on improving the city's air quality. The banning of backyard incinerators in 1987, together with the closure of two local coal fired power stations in 1986 and a 50% decrease in lead levels found in petrol, resulted in a lowering of pollution levels.Brisbane's population growth far exceeded the national average in the last two decades of the 20th century, with a high level of interstate migration from Victoria and New South Wales. 21st century After three decades of record population growth, Brisbane was hit again by a major flood in January 2011. The Brisbane River did not reach the same height as the previous 1974 flood, but still caused extensive damage and disruption to the city. Brisbane also hosted major international events including the final Goodwill Games in 2001, the Rugby League World Cup Final in 2008 and again in 2017, as well as the 2014 G20 Brisbane summit. Population grown has continued to be among the highest of the Australian capital cities in the first two decades of the 21st century, and major infrastructure including the Howard Smith Wharves, Roma Street Parklands, Queens Wharf, the Brisbane Riverwalk, the Queen's Wharf casino and resort precinct, the Brisbane International Cruise Terminal, the Clem Jones, Airport Link, and Legacy Way road tunnels, and the Airport, Springfield, Redcliffe Peninsula and Cross River Rail railway lines have been completed or are under construction.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is part of the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster. The village is located in the Adwick ward of Doncaster MBC. Although it does not currently have an air of prosperity, Highfields was built so that most houses either overlooked farmland or woodland, the ornamental Highfields Lake, or the greens in the centre of the village. Like its neighbour, Woodlands, Highfields lies between the historic Great North Road and the Roman road. The Roman road is a branch of Ermine Street, branching off near Lincoln and rejoining near York. Although a separate branch, it is also known as Ermine Street. Locally, this stretch of the road is known as the Roman Ridge, although it is more colloquially known as the Roman Rigg. David Pegg, one of the eight Manchester United footballers who died as a result of the Munich air disaster of February 1958, was born at Highfields in 1935 and lived locally until he began his career with Manchester United in the early 1950s. Half a mile south-east are the surviving earthworks, much overgrown, of Hangthwaite Castle, a medieval motte-and-bailey castle.

Early life and education Drapšin was born to a family of poor peasant farmers in the village of Turija near Srbobran (Szenttamás), Austria-Hungary a few months into World War I. By the time he reached school age, the war ended, resulting in the Austro-Hungarian defeat and disintegration along with formation of a new state Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He completed primary school in his village before going to nearby Srbobran for lower gymnasium studies. He then moved to the country's capital Belgrade, apprenticing for a tradesman position. After completing his trade term, he enrolled in the streamlined technical high school where he first got introduced to the workers' movement ideas under the auspices of the Communist Party (KPJ), a political organization banned in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Active in the school's literary section that actively spread communist ideas, Drapšin also joined KPJ's youth wing SKOJ. In 1937 he went to Prague for university studies. Soon after that, he went to fight in the Spanish Civil War, joining the Republican side. He excelled in combat, earning the rank of captain in the process. After the demise of Second Spanish Republic, he was interned in France. From there he escaped to Zagreb in 1939. World War II In 1941, following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, Drapšin was given the task of organizing armed uprising in the Herzegovina region by the Yugoslav Communist Party (KPJ). His conduct in Herzegovina got him sharp criticism from the party leadership as well as disciplinary action. However, in January 1943, the party gave him another chance by appointing him the commander of Yugoslav National Liberation Army's (YNLA) 12th Slavonian Division. Two months later he received the rank of major general. In May 1944 he became commander of YNLA's 8th Corps. During summer 1944, Drapšin became deputy commander of the Croatian National Liberation Army (NOVH), the Croatian branch of YNLA. In December 1944 Drapšin was sent to Dalmatia to command YNLA's 8th Corps. In January 1945 he received the rank of lieutenant general. Units under his command halted German offensive in Dalmatian hinterland in January 1945 and liberated Herzegovina during the Mostar Operation. Soon after that the Eight Corps got transformed into the 4th Army, which began offensive against remaining Axis forces in Yugoslavia in late March 1945. Despite difficult terrain and need for complicated amphibious operation, Drapšin's force scored spectacular success by piercing through enemy lines in Lika, defeating German forces in the Rijeka operation, landing in Istria and entering Trieste before Allied forces. This Partisan offensive was arguably the most important in the history of Yugoslavia, because it allowed Istria, Rijeka and Maritime Slovenia to become part of SFR Yugoslavia, later Croatia and Slovenia. After the war Drapšin was entered as candidate for the Yugoslav National Assembly at the post-war elections. =Alleged involvement in war crimes= Savo Skoko (1923–2013), a historian who fought on the Partisan side during World War II, hailing from the Jugovići village near Gacko compiled a book of documents and first-hand accounts titled Krvavo kolo hercegovačko 1941-1942.Krvavo kolo hercegovacko 1941-1942 at Amazon.com Published in Podgorica in 1995, the book details crimes committed by the members of People's Liberation Movement against civilians in the Herzegovina region during World War II. Petar Drapšin is mentioned as the organizer and perpetrator of a series of such crimes. After complaints within the revolutionary movement that the communists in Herzegovina are soft on \\"class enemies\\", various prominent war-tested communist leaders including Sava Kovačević and Drapšin were sent there in late 1941 and early 1942. As the commanding officers of the First Striking Battalion (Prvi udarni bataljon), their men executed 21 local villagers on 27 February 1942 on Radački brijeg. On 3 and 4 March 1942, an even bigger crime occurred when they rounded up and executed a total of 41 people from the Bileća-area villages of Golobrđe, Divljakuša, and Meka Gruda. To strengthen the psychological effect on the rest of the villagers they then proceeded to completely dehumanize their victims by dancing and celebrating around their corpses while the family members wailed. = Death = Details surrounding Drapšin's untimely death are uncertain. There are contradictory accounts about his death on 2 November 1945. The official version attributes the cause of death to an accidentally discharged pistol. Other stories tell about Drapšin being criticised at a party meeting and committing suicide afterwards. In 1953, he posthumously received the honour of the People's Hero of Yugoslavia. In his book, Skoko describes Drapšin as a \\"psychologically unstable person whose condition bordered on complete insanity\\". Skoko also disputes the official communist version of Drapšin's death and claims that he committed suicide.

Despite this, many hamartomas are found to have clonal chromosomal aberrations that are acquired through somatic mutations, and on this basis the term hamartoma is sometimes considered synonymous with neoplasm. Hamartomas are by definition benign, slow-growing or self-limiting, though the underlying condition may still predispose the individual towards malignancies. Hamartomas are usually caused by a genetic syndrome that affects the development cycle of all or at least multiple cells. Many of these conditions are classified as overgrowth syndromes or cancer syndromes. Hamartomas occur in many different parts of the body and are most often asymptomatic incidentalomas (undetected until they are found incidentally on an imaging study obtained for another reason). Additionally, the definition of hamartoma versus benign neoplasm is often unclear, since both lesions can be clonal. Lesions such as adenomas, developmental cysts, hemangiomas, lymphangiomas and rhabdomyomas within the kidneys, lungs or pancreas are interpreted by some experts as hamartomas while others consider them true neoplasms. Moreover, even though hamartomas show a benign histology, there is a risk of some rare but life-threatening complications such as those found in neurofibromatosis type I and tuberous sclerosis. It is different from choristoma, a closely related form of heterotopia. The two can be differentiated as follows: a hamartoma is an excess of normal tissue in a normal situation (e.g., a birthmark on the skin), while a choristoma is an excess of tissue in an abnormal situation (e.g., pancreatic tissue in the duodenum). The term hamartoma is from the Greek ἁμαρτία, hamartia (\\"error\\"), and was introduced by D.P.G. Albrecht in 1904.  Causes  Hamartomas result from an abnormal formation of normal tissue, although the underlying reasons for the abnormality are not fully understood. They grow along with, and at the same rate as, the organ from whose tissue they are made, and, unlike cancerous tumors, only rarely invade or compress surrounding structures significantly. Diagnosis Types = Lung  Parenchymal hamartoma of the lung. The surrounding lung falls away from the well-circumscribed mass, a typical feature of these lesions. The hamartoma shows a variegated yellow and white appearance, which corresponds respectively to fat and cartilage. About 5–8% of all solitary lung nodules and about 75% of all benign lung tumors, are hamartomas. They almost always arise from connective tissue and are generally formed of cartilage, connective tissue, and fat cells, although they may include many other types of cells. The great majority of them form in the connective tissue on the outside of the lungs, although about 10% form deep in the linings of the bronchi. They can be worrisome, especially if situated deep in the lung, as it is sometimes difficult to make the important distinction between a hamartoma and a lung malignancy. An X-ray will often not provide a definitive diagnosis, and even a CT scan may be insufficient if the hamartoma lacks the typical cartilage and fat cells. Lung hamartomas may have popcorn- like calcifications on chest xray or computed tomography (CT scan). Lung hamartomas are more common in men than in women, and may present additional difficulties in smokers. Some lung hamartomas can compress surrounding lung tissue to a degree, but this is generally not debilitating and is often asymptomatic, especially for the more common peripheral growths. They are treated, if at all, by surgical resection, with an excellent prognosis: generally, the only real danger is the inherent possibility of surgical complications.  Heart  Cardiac rhabdomyomas are hamartomas composed of altered cardiac myocytes that contain large vacuoles and glycogen. They are the most common tumor of the heart in children and infants. There is a strong association between cardiac rhabdomyomas and tuberous sclerosis (characterized by hamartomas of the central nervous system, kidneys, and skin, as well as pancreatic cysts); 25-50% of patients with cardiac rhabdomyomas will have tuberous sclerosis, and up to 100% of patients with tuberous sclerosis will have cardiac masses by echocardiography. Symptoms depend on the size of the tumor, its location relative to the conduction system, and whether or not it obstructs blood flow. Symptoms are usually from congestive heart failure; in utero heart failure may occur. If patients survive infancy, their tumors may regress spontaneously; resection in symptomatic patients has good results.  Hypothalamus  One of the most troublesome hamartomas occurs on the hypothalamus. Unlike most such growths, a hypothalamic hamartoma is symptomatic; it most often causes gelastic seizures, and can cause visual problems, other seizures, rage disorders associated with hypothalamic diseases, and early onset of puberty. The symptoms typically begin in early infancy and are progressive, often into general cognitive and/or functional disability. Moreover, resection is usually difficult, as the growths are generally adjacent to, or even intertwined with, the optic nerve. Symptoms tend to be resistant to medical control; however, surgical techniques are improving and can result in immense improvement of prognosis.  Kidneys, stomach, spleen and other vascular organs  Hamartoma in breast with ultrasound One general danger of hamartomas is that they may impinge into blood vessels, resulting in a risk of serious bleeding. Because a hamartoma typically lacks elastic tissue, it may lead to the formation of aneurysms and thus possible hemorrhage. Where a hamartoma impinges into a major blood vessel, such as the renal artery, hemorrhage must be considered life- threatening. Angiomyolipoma of the kidney was previously considered to be a hamartoma or choristoma. A myoepithelial hamartoma, also known as a pancreatic rest, is ectopic pancreatic tissue found in the stomach, duodenum, or proximal jejunum. When seen on upper gastrointestinal series, a pancreatic rest may appear to be a submucosal mass or gastric neoplasm. Most are asymptomatic, but they can cause dyspepsia or upper gastrointestinal bleeding.Shah A, Gordon AR, Ginsberg GG, Furth EE, Levine MS. Case report: ectopic pancreatic rest in the proximal stomach mimicking gastric neoplasms. Clin Radiol. 2007 Jun;62(6):600-2. Epub 2007 Mar 26. No abstract available. A hamartoma has been identified as a cause of partial outflow obstruction in the abomasum (true gastric stomach) of a dairy goat https://vetrecordcasereports.bmj.com/content/5/3/e000515. Hamartomas of the spleen are uncommon but can be dangerous. About 50% of such cases manifest abdominal pain, and they are often associated with hematologic abnormalities and spontaneous rupture.  Cowden syndrome  Cowden syndrome is a serious genetic disorderMutation of PTEN gene on arm 10q (~85% of cases) or rarely germline mutation in BMPR1A characterized by multiple hamartomas. Usually skin hamartomas exist, and commonly (in about 66% of cases) hamartoma of the thyroid gland exists. Additional growths can form in many parts of the body, especially in bones, CNS, the eyes, the genitourinary tract, the GI tract, and mucosa. The hamartomas themselves may cause symptoms or even death, but morbidity is more often associated with increased occurrence of malignancies, usually in the breast or thyroid. Cowden syndrome is considered a PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), which also includes Bannayan–Riley–Ruvalcaba syndrome, Proteus syndrome and Proteus-like syndrome.  Prognosis  Hamartomas, while generally benign, can cause problems due to their location. For example, when located on the skin, especially on the face or neck, they can be very disfiguring. Cases have been reported of hamartomas the size of a small orange. They may obstruct practically any organ in the body, such as the colon, eye, etc. They are particularly likely to cause major health issues when located in the hypothalamus, kidneys, lips, or spleen. They can be removed surgically if necessary, and are not likely to recur. Prognosis will depend upon the location and size of the lesion, as well as the overall health of the patient.

The film uses mixed media animation and unconventional narrative to explore the issues of domestic violence and child abuse from within the confines of the patriarchal family unit. Based on Watson's own childhood experience, the film was made in an attempt to highlight the (then taboo) issue of sexual abuse and the social myths surrounding it. Several styles of animation are used: most of the scenes taking place in Watson's house are made using puppet animation, while other parts of the film - most notably some scenes taking place in a pub - render the characters as collages of torn-up photographs against a black background. A short sequence at the start, setting the scene with a modified retelling of Snow White, uses more conventional-looking drawn animation. The puppets in the home sequences are made from household objects: the young Karen Watson is made from feathers with a doll's house vase as a head, her mother is made from miniature kitchen utensils with a model bunch of grapes as a head, while the father is made from scrap metal and has a vice-like beak. In addition, Karen Watson is often shown with a piece of tape covering her mouth, while her mother sometimes has tape over her eyes. The pub scenes - the only parts of the film in which the characters talk, as the home scenes are narrated by the adult Karen Watson - involve a group of men discussing sexually abusive fathers, and are used to underline popular conceptions and misconceptions of the issue (\\"All these lasses gotta do is say no\\", ventures one man). The scenes convey the theme of sexism symbolically: the bartender turns into a giant and caresses a tiny barmaid, while a group of card players sprinkle cigarette ash on pictures of naked women. The film was shot on 16 mm film and runs eight minutes.

Dalechampia has unisexual flowers that are secondarily united into bisexual blossoms (pseudanthia), which act as the pollination units. The pollination and floral evolution of this genus have been studied more intensively than perhaps any other member of the euphorbia family. In the neotropics (Americas), most species are pollinated by resin-collecting female bees, including euglossine bees and Hypanthidium of the Megachilidae, which use resin in nest construction. About a dozen neotropical species (including D. spathulata, shown below) are pollinated by fragrance-collecting male euglossine bees, which use these fragrances to attract females for mating. There are at least three independent pollination shifts from pollination by female resin- collecting bees to pollination by male fragrance-collecting bees. African and Asian species are also pollinated by resin-collecting megachilid bees, but Malagasy species are pollinated by pollen-feeding beetles and pollen- collecting bees. Two species are of horticultural interest, D. spathulata and D. aristolochiifolia, have particularly showy blossoms with bright pink/purple bracts. Dalechampia aristolochiifolia, from Peru, has become very popular recently, but it is mistakenly advertised and distributed under the name D. dioscoreifolia.

Mount Cleveland is the highest mountain in Glacier National Park, located in Montana, United States. It is also the highest point in the Lewis Range, which spans part of the northern portion of the Park and extends into Canada. It is located approximately southeast of the southern end of Waterton Lake, and approximately south of the US/Canada border. The east side of the future national park was purchased by the federal government from the Blackfoot Confederacy in 1895 during the second term of President Cleveland. According to the United States Board on Geographic Names, the mountain is named for the former president. While not of great absolute elevation (the mountain is more than lower than Granite Peak, the highest peak in Montana), Mount Cleveland is notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain. For example, its west flank rises over in less than ; the northwest face, steepest on the mountain, rises in less than . The other faces show almost as much vertical relief. This scale and steepness of relief is quite rare in the contiguous United States. Mount Cleveland is 50th on a list of peaks in the contiguous U.S. with the most topographic prominence. The massif upon which Mount Cleveland is situated also includes Kaiser Point, which is the seventh tallest peak in the park and is only to the northeast. The first recorded ascent of Mount Cleveland was in 1920 by Frank B. Wynn. The easiest route on the peak is the West Face route, starting from the Waterton Valley; it is a scramble (Class 3) with the possibility of some short exposed sections (Class 4). Other routes include the Stoney Indian Route, from Stoney Indian Pass to the south of the peak, first descended by noted Sierra mountaineer Norman Clyde and party in 1937; various routes on the Southeast Face; and the more difficult North (or Northwest) Face, climbed partially in 1971 and completely in 1976. Although the peak has a relatively low fatality record, five Montana climbers were killed on the peak's west face in December 1969. The climbers were swept away by an avalanche and were not found for seven months. __TOC__ See also *List of mountain peaks of North America **List of mountain peaks of the United States ***List of Ultras of the United States *List of mountains and mountain ranges of Glacier National Park (U.S.) ReferencesExternal links * * Category:Mountains of Glacier County, Montana Category:Mountains of Glacier National Park (U.S.) Category:Highest points of United States national parks Category:Lewis Range Category:Mountains of Montana ","title":"Mount Cleveland (Montana)"},{"id":"2465761","text":"William Fielding Ogburn (June 29, 1886 – April 27, 1959) was an American sociologist who was born in Butler, Georgia and died in Tallahassee, Florida. He was also a statistician and an educator. Ogburn received his B.A. degree from Mercer University and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University. He was a professor of sociology at Columbia from 1919 until 1927, when he became chair of the Sociology Department at the University of Chicago. He served as the president of American Sociological Society in 1929. He was the editor of the Journal of the American Statistical Association from 1920 to 1926. In 1931, he was elected as the president of American Statistical Association, which also elected him as a Fellow in 1920. He was also known for his idea of \\"culture lag\\" in society's adjustment to technological and other changes. This concept is mentioned in the book Future Shock, by Alvin Toffler. He played a pivotal role in producing the groundbreaking Recent Social Trends during his research directorship of President Herbert Hoover's Committee on Social Trends from 1930 to 1933. He was one of the most prolific sociologists of his time, with 175 articles under his name.  Social change  Perhaps Ogburn's most enduring intellectual legacy is the theory of social change he offered in 1922. He suggested that technology is the primary engine of progress, but tempered by social responses to it. Thus, his theory is often considered a case of Technological determinism, but is really more than that. Ogburn posited four stages of technical development: invention, accumulation, diffusion and adjustment. Invention is the process by which new forms of technology are created. Inventions are collective contributions to an existing cultural base that cannot occur unless the society has already gained a certain level of knowledge and expertise in the particular area. Accumulation is the growth of technology because new things are invented more rapidly than old ones are forgotten, and some inventions (such as writing) promote this accumulation process. Diffusion is the spread of an idea from one cultural group to another, or from one field of activity to another, and as diffusion brings inventions together, they combine to form new inventions. Adjustment is the process by which the non-technical aspects of a culture respond to invention, and any retardation of this adjustment process causes cultural lag.

Initially established in 1894, the institution received the authorisation of the Government of the Republic of Zimbabwe through an act of Parliament to operate as a university in 1994. As a university it first opened on 4 October 1994, the first private institution of higher education in the country. Following the granting of the charter by the Government it was renamed Solusi University. The university follows American grading and business, research, and liberal arts curricular patterns. It is owned and run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and is part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system. Kamushinda Square History Beit Hall Solusi Mission was the first Seventh- day Adventist mission station in Africa. It was founded in 1894 on 12,000 acres of land given by Cecil Rhodes, prime minister of Cape Colony, to Pieter Wessels and Asa T. Robinson. On October 31, 1956, the Board of Regents of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists approved Solusi Mission Training School to become a college. In 1958, Solusi College was giving Bachelor's Degrees to church workers throughout southern and central africa to meet the needs of a growing church membership. Later on negotiations were made to receive affiliation with a Seventh-day Adventist university in the United States. In October 1984 Solusi College became affiliated with Andrews University. During the 10 years of affiliation with Andrews University, Solusi College grew rapidly. New courses were added and enrollment increased by 500%. In 1991 Solusi College submitted an application to become a private university. In March 1992 the National Council visited Solusi College. In July 1994, a charter established Solusi University. On May 4, 1995, His Excellency, Cde Robert Gabriel Mugabe, gave the Solusi University Charter to Chancellor, Dr I. D. Raelly. His Excellency became the first graduate as recipient of the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws. With the establishment of Solusi University, granting of Andrews University degrees became obsolete in August 1998. Fire In July 2018 a bakery on the campus was gutted by fire, the destroyed property was worth $25,000.

British Railways Britannia was built at Crewe, completed on 2 January 1951. She was the first British Railways standard locomotive to be built and the first of 55 locomotives of the Britannia class. The locomotive was named at a ceremony at Marylebone Station by the then Minister for Transport Alfred Barnes on 30 January 1951. The BR Locomotive Naming Committee were determined not to use names already in use on other locomotives. They tried to observe this by not selecting the name Britannia for use on 70000 because it was already in use on one of the ex-LMS Jubilee Class locomotives, specifically No. 45700 but Robert Riddles overruled them and the Jubilee had to be renamed to Amethyst.Itinerary dated 8 October 1993, Queen of Scots Train. Britannia was initially based at Stratford (30A) in order to work East Anglian expresses to Norwich and Great Yarmouth, but was also particularly associated with the Hook Continental boat train to Harwich. Subsequently, the loco was based at Norwich Thorpe (w/e 31 January 1959) and March (June 1961) before spending the remainder of her career on the London Midland Region: Willesden (1A) (w/e 30 March 1963), Crewe North (5A) (w/e 25 May 1963), Crewe South (5B) (w/e 19 May 1965) and finally Newton Heath (9D) (w/e 5 March 1966) from where she was withdrawn w/e 28 May 1966, The locomotive pulled the funeral train of King George VI from King's Lynn, Norfolk to London following his death in February 1952 at Sandringham House, Norfolk. For this task, Britannia had her cab roof painted white, as was the custom with royal locomotives (B2 61617 Ford Castle, which pulled the train from Wolferton Station to King's Lynn, was similarly liveried). Britannia has also worn the white roof in preservation. Britannia was withdrawn in May 1966, after 15 years of service. Preservation Britannia on a charter train on Whalley Viaduct in 1994 Initially destined for the National Railway Museum because of her cultural significance, she was stored. However, due to her prototype design and construction differences, the NRM chose standard sister 70013 Oliver Cromwell, instead. Britannia was eventually bought by Britannia Locomotive Company Ltd. After a series of moves, she was eventually returned to steam on the Severn Valley Railway, where she remained for a number of years in operational but non-mainline condition. With the society wishing to make more use of the locomotive, she was moved to the European gauge Nene Valley Railway in Peterborough, where she was also fitted with an air-brake compressor, and was based there from 1980-2000. Britannia made her return to the main line on 27 July 1991, successfully working enthusiast trips until 1997, and was featured in an episode of London's Burning. Britannia at Canterbury West, April 2011. With an expired mainline boiler certificate, due to the high cost of refurbishment, the locomotive was sold to Pete Waterman in 2000. Stored at Waterman's workshops at the Crewe Heritage Centre, after initial assessment the amount of work resulted in Waterman selling her to Jeremy Hosking. The locomotive underwent restoration at Crewe which involved a newly refurbished cab, a new smoke box and major work on the boiler; replacement steel sides, new crown stays, new front section barrel section, new steel and copper tubeplate, repairs and patches to door plate and major work to copper firebox. Transferred to the Royal Scot Locomotive and General Trust (RSL>), the locomotive was returned to main line operational condition in 2011, initially out shopped in its prototype black British Railways livery (where it did not have nameplates fitted, as was thus known by railway convention as 70000). After a running-in period, in 2012 the locomotive was repainted in British Railways Brunswick Green, but with an early BR crest (unlike her sister 70013 Oliver Cromwell which carries BR's Late Crest). On 24 January 2012, the loco hauled the Royal Train with Prince Charles on board to , where he rededicated the locomotive. For the trip the loco again had a painted white cab roof, removed after the engine's appearance at the West Somerset Railway's Spring Gala.

She was the first female student to attend Brown University and served as the 11th President of Mount Holyoke College from 1900 to 1937. Early life and education Woolley was the daughter of Joseph Judah (J.J.) Woolley and his second wife, Mary Augusta Ferris. She was given the nickname May, and enjoyed a comfortable, nurturing childhood in New England. She was first raised in Meriden, Connecticut and, starting in 1871, Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Her father was a Congregational minister and his efforts to incorporate social work into religion, heavily influenced his daughter. Woolley attended Providence High School and a number of smaller schools run by women before finishing her secondary schooling, in 1884, at the Wheaton Seminary in Norton, Massachusetts. Woolley returned to teach there from 1885 to 1891. After traveling through Europe for two months during the summer of 1890, she intended to attend Oxford University, but her father agreed with Elisha Benjamin Andrews, the president of Brown University, that Woolley should become one of the first female students at Brown. She began attending Brown in the fall of 1890, while still teaching at Wheaton. In 1894, she received her B.A. and in 1895, her M.A. for her thesis titled, The Early History of the Colonial Post Office. Teaching career In 1895, Woolley began teaching biblical history and literature at Wellesley College. She was popular among her students and peers and, in 1896, she was made an associate professor. By 1899, she had been promoted to full professor. During her time at Wellesley, she made significant changes in the curriculum while gaining administrative experiences as the chair of her department. She also met Jeannette Augustus Marks, a student at Wellesley. Beginning in 1899, the two women lived in a life-partnership for 48 years.Lillian Faderman, Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America, Penguin Books Ltd, 1991, page 53. In December 1899, Brown offered her a job as the head of the newly founded Women's College. Simultaneously, Mount Holyoke College offered her its presidency. Woolley took Mount Holyoke's offer and on January 1, 1901, at the age of 38, became one of the youngest college presidents in the United States. Also in 1900, she became the first woman to receive an honorary degree from Amherst College. Mount Holyoke Presidency Woolley in 1903 Immediately upon arrival at Mount Holyoke, Woolley outlined her views on female education. While in the past, the college had placed an emphasis on women's education in service to society, Woolley stressed that in the future, a women's education would not need to be justified by anything but intellectual grounds. Woolley believed education, roughly, was a preparation for life, and that an educated woman was able to achieve anything. She argued that if women had not succeeded in the past, it was because their education, or lack thereof, had held them back. As the president of a women's college, one of her many responsibilities was to publicly support female education. During her 36-year presidency, she worked to end the prejudice of the era that contended that women had a natural learning disability and that intellectual work negatively affected their health. Woolley began to have influence within the academic community, and she led cooperative efforts with other women's colleges to raise funds, academic standards and public consciousness for women's education. During Woolley's presidency, she built a strong faculty, attracting scholars from the most prestigious graduate schools by offering increased salaries, fellowships, and sabbaticals. Woolley also attempted to improve the quality of students admitted to Mount Holyoke, after raising admission standards, introducing honors programs and general examinations for seniors. The college endowment also grew from $500,000 to nearly $5 million and the campus added sixteen new building during her 36-year presidency. One of her most significant changes came when she abolished the domestic work system, instituted by the college's founder, Mary Lyon. When Lyon founded the college in 1837, students were required to cook and clean for economic reasons, and other women's colleges followed the example. By 1901, Mount Holyoke was the only women's college with the system still in place and Woolley thought the system was old fashioned and an obstacle in her goal of making Mount Holyoke intellectually equal to male colleges. She also created a position for Jeanette Marks, who taught English and Theater at Mount Holyoke until her retirement in 1941. Though the women never publicly acknowledged a lesbian relationship, there were some undercurrents of resentment at the college for Woolley's alleged \\"favoritism\\" towards Marks.See Ann Karus Meeropol A Practical Visionary: Mary Emma Woolley and the Education of Women diss. University of Massachusetts, 1992. Organizational activity Woolley also managed to devote her time to a number of organizations during her presidency, advocating for social reform of all kinds, including suffrage, pacifism and church matters. She served as the vice president of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and also worked on U.S. entry into the League of Nations. She also worked with President Herbert Hoover on women's rights and with President Franklin D. Roosevelt on pacifism. She was an early member of the Association of Collegiate Alumnae which later became the American Association of University Women. From 1927-1933, she served as President of AAUW. She gained international recognition after President Hoover appointed her as a delegate to the Conference on Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, which met in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1932. She was on the board of electors of the Hall of Fame, the national board of the Y.W.C.A., the executive committee of the American School Peace League, the council of the National Institute for Moral Instruction, the Commission on Peace and Arbitration. She was a senator of the United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa and honorary vice president of the National Consumers' League. In 1900, Woolley was one of 60 signers of the \\"Call for the Lincoln Emancipation Conference to Discuss Means for Securing Political and Civil Equality for the Negro\\", a document that created the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Later years Beginning in 1933, an effort began to gather steam among some male members of the Board of Trustees to make sure that when Woolley retired, she would be replaced by a male president. Many of the Board members who supported this approach believed that Mount Holyoke College had become \\"overfeminized\\" with most of the departments headed by women and male faculty in a small minority. Some looked to Mount Holyoke as a place where graduates of Yale University might find jobs and felt that hiring a male president would make that more likely. Woolley retired in 1937 at the age of 74. The appointment of Roswell Gray Ham to succeed her was a bitter blow to opportunities for women to advance through higher education. She, members of the faculty, members of the AAUW and members of the alumnae group fought back strenuously. The vote at the June 6, 1936 Board meeting just achieved the required majority despite eloquent pleas from trustee Frances Perkins (a Mount Holyoke alumna and Secretary of Labor), Woolley and members of the faculty. After Ham was appointed, some alumnae attempted to rouse sufficient opposition to convince Ham to refuse the appointment but official Mount Holyoke closed ranks and the opposition was defeated. Woolley and her allies did have the \\"last word\\" at the college's centennial celebration in May 1937 (a month before Ham took office). He was not invited to attend and many of the speeches decried the actions of the Board of Trustees. After her retirement, Woolley never visited the Mount Holyoke campus again. She moved to the Marks family home in Westport, NY and lived there with Marks until her death in 1947. Woolley remained an active social advocate during her retirement, and she spent much of her time lecturing at meetings and conferences. On September 30, 1944, in her Westport, New York home, she suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage which partially paralyzed her. She spent the final three years of her life in a wheelchair and Marks cared for her until her death in 1947. In popular culture Woolley was the subject of a play, Bull in a China Shop, written by Mount Holyoke alumna Bryna Turner. The show premiered at the Lincoln Center on March 1, 2017. Works In addition to her master's thesis, she wrote Development of the Love of Romantic Scenery in America and many educational articles.

They form the single largest defined ethnolinguistic group in Mauritania where they account for 40% of the population (~1.5 million).Mauritania, CIA Factbook They have been called a socially distinct class of workers, or a caste that emerged from a legacy of slavery in Africa under the Arabs and the Berbers., Quote: \\"Haratine. Social caste in several northwestern African countries consisting of blacks, many of whom are former slaves (...)\\"John Shoup (2007), The Griot Tradition in Ḥassāniyya Music: the \\"Īggāwen\\", Quaderni di Studi Arabi Nuova Serie, Vol. 2 (2007), pp. 95-102, Quote: \\"There are a number of other castes in Baydan society including the Haratin who farm for the (...)\\"; The Haratin have been, and still commonly, are socially isolated throughout Maghreb, living in segregated, Haratin-only ghettos. They are commonly perceived as an endogamous group of former slaves or descendants of slaves. They adopted Islam under the Arabs and Berbers and were forcibly recruited into the Moroccan army by Ismail Ibn Sharif to consolidate power. Traditionally, many members of the community have held occupations in agriculture – as serfs, herdsmen, and indentured workers.  Etymology  The etymology of Haratine comes from hartani, which is from the Berber word ahardan (pl. ihardin) referring to skin color, more specifically \\"dark color\\". This word is absent from the Arabic language and has been used by the Sanhaja tribe and Zenata tribe before the arrival of the Beni Ḥassān.  History  It is suggested that the origins of the Haratin can be traced back to the original black African (and later also mixed-race) inhabitants of the Tassili n'Ajjer and Acacus Mountains sites in the Epipalaeolithic era. In the Neolithic era when the climate humidified, the ancestors of the Haratin were mostly hunters and ox-herders. At the end of the second millennium before common era and with the introduction of the horse, Proto-Berbers from Northeastern Africa started to conquer the Western part of the Sahara and largely displaced the earlier peoples. When the Sahara dried up some natives moved to the Sahel for a more humid climate while others, the ancestors of the Haratin stayed around the oases across the Sahara, such as the Draa valley region, where they have lived for centuries. The Haratin form an ethnic group distinct from Arab as Tuareg populations, as well as from the contemporary ethnic groups of Sub-Saharan Africa. However, in countries such as Morocco, they are sometimes classified either as Berber or Arab, depending on their language and society they are found in. In Mauritania, however, where there are nearly 1.5 million Haratin, they have developed a separate sense of ethnic identity. During the Roman occupation of Mauretania, the Godala Berber tribe fled to the south towards the Draa oasis and enslaved the local Haratin population. They have historically inherited their slave status and family occupation, have been endogamous, and socially segregated. Some communities differentiated two types of slaves, one called 'Abid or \\"slave\\" and Haratin or \\"freed slave\\". However, per anthropologist John Shoup, both 'Abid and Haratin were not free to own land or had equivalent property rights. Regardless of whether they were technically free or not, they were treated as socially inferior in the communities they lived in. Being denied the right and the ability to own any land, they historically survived by accepting a patron- client serf relationship either as domestic servant or as share-cropping labor (khammasin). They became a common target of mandatory conscription by the Moroccan ruler Ismail Ibn Sharif as he sought to build a military that had no social or cultural attachment to any other Arab or Berber group in Maghreb. He conscripted majority of able-bodied male Haratin and 'Abid that were present in Morocco at the time. This army was then commonly coerced into a series of wars in order to consolidate Ibn Sharif's power.  Haratin communities Mauritania= In Mauritania, the Haratin form one of the largest ethnic groups and account for as much as 40% of the Mauritanians. They are sometimes referred to as \\"Black Moors\\", in contrast to Beidane, or \\"White Moors\\". The Haratin there are primarily Hassaniya Arabic. The Haratin of Mauritania, according to anthropologist Joseph Hellweg, who specializes in West African studies, were historically part of a social caste-like hierarchy that likely developed from a Bedouin legacy between the 14th and 16th century. The \\"Hassan\\" monopolized the occupations related to war and politics, the \\"Zwaya\\" (Zawaya) the religious roles, the \\"Bidan\\" (White Moors) owned property and held slaves (Haratins, Black Moors). Each of these were immovable castes, endogamous, with hereditary occupations and where the upper strata collected tribute (horma) from the lower strata of Mauritanian society, considered them socially inferior, and denied them the right to own land or weapons thereby creating a socio-economically closed system.Anthony G. Pazzanita (1999), Middle East Journal, Political Transition in Mauritania: Problems and Prospects, Volume 53, Number 1 (Winter, 1999), pages 44-58Katherine Ann Wiley (2016), Making People Bigger: Wedding Exchange and the Creation of Social Value in Rural Mauritania, Africa Today, Johns Hopkins University Press, Volume 62, Number 3, pages 48-69Melinda Smale (1980), Women in Mauritania, USAID: Mauritania, Office of Women in Development, Agency for International Development, OICD Washington DC, page viii-ix, xviii-xix, 12-17, 35-36, 43; Quote: \\"Caste is the most specific of these crucial concepts. When applied to West African societies, it is used in the very general meaning of the division of societies into hierarchically rank-endogamous-occupational groups; the relation between these groups having ritual as well as economic significance. (...) To understand Mauritanian society, one must understand its ethnic groups, its tribes, socio-economic classes and its castes. The Hassaniya speakers who predominate over the majority of the country except along the river are divisible into two crucial subgroups - the Bidan or white Moors and the Haratin or black Moors. The Bidan are traditionally further divided into Z'waya (religious or \\"marabout\\" groups), Hassan (warrior groups), Zenaga (free tributary groups), Mu'allamin (craftsmen) and Ighyuwn (entertainers) (...) In 1960, Mauritania officially abolished slavery, and made another update to its slavery law in 1981. However, even after the formalities, abolishment, and new laws, discrimination against Haratin is still widespread, and many continue to be, for all practical purposes, enslaved, while large numbers live in other forms of informal dependence on their former masters. In Mauritania, the use of Haratin girls as servants has attracted activists. Amnesty International reported that in 1994 90,000 Haratine still lived as \\"property\\" of their master, with the report indicating that \\"slavery in Mauritania is most dominant within the traditional upper class of the Moors.\\"Afrol News According to Mauritanian officials, any master-serf relationship is mutually consensual. This position has been questioned by the United Nations and human rights advocacy groups. The Amnesty International report states that \\"[s]ocial attitudes have changed among most urban Moors, but in rural areas, the ancient divide is still very alive.\\" There have been many attempts to assess the real extension of slavery in modern Mauritania, but these have mostly been frustrated by the Nouakchott government's official stance that the practice has been eliminated. Amnesty further estimated that some 300,000 freed slaves continued to be in service of their former masters. On 27 April 2007 Messaoud Ould Boulkheir was elected speaker of the National Assembly, becoming the first black Haratine to hold the position. =Morocco= Haratin in Morocco are mostly concentrated in the southern part of the Drâa-Tafilalet region, particularly towns such as Zagora where they make up a significant portion of the populace. Haratin have been the slave strata of the Moroccan society through its recorded history. They were owned in every town and farming centers before the time of Moroccan ruler Ismail Ibn Sharif. They provided domestic labor, farm labor, physical labor inside towns and markets, as well as were conscripted to fight wars. According to Remco Ensel – a professor of Anthropology specializing in Maghreb studies, the word \\"Haratin\\" in Moroccan is a pejorative that connotes \\"subordination, disrepute\\" and in contemporary literature, it is often replaced with \\"Drawi\\", \\"Drawa\\", \\"Sahrawi\\", \\"Sahrawa\\", or other regional terms. The Moroccan Haritin, states Chouki El Hamel – a professor of History specializing in African Studies, are the diaspora of black West Africans who were forcefully transported across the Sahara and sold in Moroccan slave markets over centuries. They absorbed the \\"Arabo-centric values in the dominant interpretation of Islam\\", states El Hamel, over the generations and they see themselves as Muslim Moroccans, rather than by their ethnic or native group. The Haratin strata, as slave workers, were a major institution of Moroccan society through the 19th century. Yet, there has been a general lack of historical records about their origins and ethnography, leading to several constructed proposals, and their mention in older Moroccan literature is generally limited to their status as slaves and more focused on the rights on their owners. It is their contemporary economic and social marginalization that has awakened renewed interest in their history and their oral histories. The Haratins remain indispensable workers in modern oases societies, states Ensel, and continue to be mistreated in contrast to the upper strata called the \\"Shurfa\\". According to Remco Ensel, Haratin, along with Swasin in Morocco and other northern fringe societies of the Sahara, were a part of a social hierarchy that included the upper strata of nobles, religious specialists, and literati, followed by freemen, nomadic pastoral strata, and slaves. The Haratin were hierarchically higher than the 'Abid (descendant of slaves) at the very bottom, but lower than Ahrar. This hierarchy, states Ensel, has been variously described as ethnic groups, estates, quasi-castes, castes, or classes. The Haratins historically lived segregated from the main society, in a rural isolation. Their subjugation was sometimes ideologically justified by nobles and some religious scholars, even though others disagreed., Quote: \\"This new meaning was an ideological construct to justify the subjugation of the free/freed blacks [Haratin] and was buttressed by documents that sought to advance the Makhzan's agenda by demonstrating that the Haratin were of slave origin, therefore creating a racialized caste\\". The social stratification of Haratin and their inter- relationships with others members of the society varied by valley and oasis, but whether the Haratins were technically 'unfreed, semi-freed, or freed' slaves, they were considered as \\"inferior\\" by other strata of the society. The Haratin remain the marginalized population of Morocco, just like other similar groups around the world. =Western Sahara= According to Human Rights Watch, Morocco alleges that slavery is widespread in the Sahrawi refugee camps run by the Polisario Front in southwestern Algeria; POLISARIO denies this and claims to have eradicated slavery through awareness campaigns. A 2009 investigative report by Human Rights Watch interviewed some dark-skinned Sahrawi people, who are a small minority in the camps; they stated that some \\"blacks\\" are \\"owned\\" by \\"whites\\" but this ownership manifested only in \\"granting\\" marriage rights to girls. In other words, a dark-skinned girl must have an approval from her \\"white master\\". Without this, the marriage can not be performed by a qadi. The report notes that POLISARIO claims to oppose any such discrimination, but raises questions about possible official collusion in, or indifference to, the practice. In addition, a case of an official document that grants freedom to a group of enslaved families has been found by HRW. The document in question dates as recently as 2007. The document was signed by a local judge or an official civil servant. Slavery is still engraved in memories due to historical and traditional reasons, and such cases are not as shocking as one might think to the society of the Sahrawi refugee camps. The Human Rights Watch concludes its chapter on slavery as follows, \\"In sum, credible sources testified to Human Rights Watch about vestiges of slavery that continue to affect the lives of a portion of the black minority in the Tindouf camps. The practices involve historical ties between families that involve certain rights and obligations that are not always clear. Being a slave does not necessarily preclude enjoying freedom of movement.\\" Responding to questions about slavery, the POLISARIO has acknowledged the survival \\"to a limited extent, of certain practices related to antiquated thinking\\" and said it was \\"determined to combat and eradicate them whenever they emerge and no matter what shape they take.\\" \\"We welcome this statement and urge the POLISARIO to be vigilant in pursuing this objective,\\" said HRW.

Both are fictionalized retellings of the Battle of Thermopylae within the Persian Wars. The film was co-written and directed by Zack Snyder, while Miller served as executive producer and consultant. It was filmed mostly with a superimposition chroma key technique, to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. The plot revolves around King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), who leads 300 Spartans into battle against the Persian \\"God-King\\" Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his invading army of more than 300,000 soldiers. As the battle rages, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband. The story is framed by a voice-over narrative by the Spartan soldier Dilios (David Wenham). Through this narrative technique, various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing 300 within the genre of historical fantasy. 300 was released for the first time in Austin Butt-Numb-A-Thon on December 9, 2006, later released in Berlin International Film Festival on February 14, 2007, and finally released in both conventional and IMAX theaters in the United States on March 9, 2007, and on DVD, Blu-ray Disc, and HD DVD on July 31, 2007. Critics praised its visuals and style but criticised its depiction of the Persians, which some characterized as bigoted or Iranophobic. The film grossed over $456 million, and the film's opening was the 24th-largest in box office history at the time. A sequel, titled Rise of an Empire, based on Miller's previously unpublished graphic novel prequel Xerxes, was released on March 7, 2014. Plot In 479 B.C., one year after the Battle of Thermopylae, Dilios, a hoplite in the Spartan army, begins his story by depicting the life of Leonidas I from childhood to kingship via Spartan doctrine. Dilios's story continues and a Persian herald arrives at the gates of Sparta demanding \\"earth and water\\" as a token of submission to King Xerxes—the Spartans reply by throwing the envoy and his escort into a deep well. Leonidas then visits the Ephors, proposing a strategy to drive back the numerically superior Persians through the Hot Gates. His plan involves building a wall in order to funnel the Persians into a narrow pass between the rocks and the sea: negating the Persian advantage in numbers, and giving the Greeks' heavy infantry the advantage over the vast waves of Persian light infantry. The Ephors consult the Oracle, who decrees that Sparta may not go to war during the Carneia. As Leonidas angrily departs, an agent from Xerxes appears, rewarding the Ephors for their covert support. Although the Ephors have denied him permission to mobilize Sparta's army, Leonidas gathers three hundred of his best soldiers in the guise of his personal bodyguard. They are joined along the way by a few thousand Arcadians. At Thermopylae, they construct the wall, using slain Persian scouts as mortar. Stelios, an elite Spartan soldier, orders an enraged Persian emissary to return to his lines and warn Xerxes, after cutting off his whipping arm. Meanwhile, Leonidas encounters Ephialtes, a deformed Spartan whose parents fled Sparta to spare him certain infanticide. Ephialtes asks to redeem his father's name by joining Leonidas' army, warning him of a secret path the Persians could use to outflank and surround the Spartans. Though sympathetic, Leonidas rejects him since his deformity physically prevents him from holding his shield high enough, potentially compromising the phalanx formation. The battle begins soon after the Spartans' refusal to lay down their weapons. Using the Hot Gates to their advantage, as well as their superior fighting skills, the Spartans repel wave after wave of the advancing Persian army. Xerxes personally approaches Leonidas and offers him wealth and power in exchange for his submission. Leonidas declines and mocks the inferior quality of Xerxes' fanatical warriors. In response, Xerxes sends in his elite guard, the Immortals; the Spartans nonetheless defeat them with few losses, with slight help from the Thespians. On the second day, Xerxes sends in new waves of armies from Asia and other Persian subject states, including war elephants, to crush the Spartans, but to no avail. Meanwhile, an embittered Ephialtes defects to Xerxes to whom he reveals the secret path in exchange for wealth, luxury, women, and a Persian uniform. The Arcadians retreat upon learning of Ephialtes' betrayal, but the Spartans stay. Leonidas orders an injured but reluctant Dilios to return to Sparta and tell them of what has happened: a \\"tale of victory\\". In Sparta, Queen Gorgo tries to persuade the Spartan Council to send reinforcements to aid the 300. Theron, a corrupt politician, claims that he \\"owns\\" the Council and threatens the Queen, who reluctantly submits to his sexual demands in return for his help. When Theron disgraces her in front of the Council, Gorgo kills him out of rage, revealing within his robe a bag of Xerxes' gold. Marking his betrayal, the Council unanimously agrees to send reinforcements. On the third day, the Persians, led by Ephialtes, traverse the secret path, encircling the Spartans. Xerxes' general again demands their surrender. Leonidas seemingly kneels in submission, allowing Stelios to leap over him and kill the general. Angered, Xerxes orders his troops to attack. Leonidas throws his spear at Xerxes, barely missing him; the spear cuts across and wounds his face, proving the God-King's mortality. Leonidas and the remaining Spartans fight to the last man until they finally succumb to an arrow barrage. Dilios, now back in Sparta, concludes his tale before the Council. Inspired by Leonidas' sacrifice, the Greeks mobilize. One year later, the Persians face an army of 30,000 free Greeks led by a vanguard of 10,000 Spartans. After one final speech commemorating the 300, Dilios, now head of the Spartan Army, leads them to war, against the Persians across the fields of Plataea.

Production Above: the film version of a panel from the graphic novel (below) Producer Gianni Nunnari was not the only person planning a film about the Battle of Thermopylae; director Michael Mann already planned a film of the battle based on the book Gates of Fire. Nunnari discovered Frank Miller's graphic novel 300, which impressed him enough to acquire the film rights. 300 was jointly produced by Nunnari and Mark Canton, and Michael B. Gordon wrote the script. Director Zack Snyder was hired in June 2004 as he had attempted to make a film based on Miller's novel before making his debut with the remake of Dawn of the Dead. Snyder then had screenwriter Kurt Johnstad rewrite Gordon's script for production and Frank Miller was retained as consultant and executive producer. Frank Miller's original graphic novel 300 was inspired by the film The 300 Spartans, which Miller first saw at age 6. The film is a shot-for-shot adaptation of the comic book, similar to the film adaptation of Sin City. Snyder photocopied panels from the comic book, from which he planned the preceding and succeeding shots. \\"It was a fun process for me… to have a frame as a goal to get to,\\" he said. Like the comic book, the adaptation also used the character Dilios as a narrator. Snyder used this narrative technique to show the audience that the surreal \\"Frank Miller world\\" of 300 was told from a subjective perspective. By using Dilios' gift of storytelling, he was able to introduce fantasy elements into the film, explaining that \\"Dilios is a guy who knows how not to wreck a good story with truth.\\" Snyder also added the subplot in which Queen Gorgo attempts to rally support for her husband. Above: A scene during filming Below: The finished scene Two months of pre-production were required to create hundreds of shields, spears, and swords, some of which were recycled from Troy and Alexander. Creatures were designed by Jordu Schell, and an animatronic wolf and thirteen animatronic horses were created. The actors trained alongside the stuntmen, and even Snyder joined in. Upwards of 600 costumes were created for the film, as well as extensive prosthetics for various characters and the corpses of Persian soldiers. Shaun Smith and Mark Rappaport worked hand in hand with Snyder in pre-production to design the look of the individual characters, and to produce the prosthetic makeup effects, props, weapons and dummy bodies required for the production. 300 entered active production on October 17, 2005, in Montreal, and was shot over the course of sixty days in chronological order with a budget of $60 million. Employing the digital backlot technique, Snyder shot at the now-defunct Icestorm Studios in Montreal using bluescreens. Butler said that while he did not feel constrained by Snyder's direction, fidelity to the comic imposed certain limitations on his performance. Wenham said there were times when Snyder wanted to precisely capture iconic moments from the comic book, and other times when he gave actors freedom \\"to explore within the world and the confines that had been set\\". Headey said of her experience with the bluescreens, \\"It's very odd, and emotionally, there's nothing to connect to apart from another actor.\\" Only one scene, in which horses travel across the countryside, was shot outdoors. The film was an intensely physical production, and Butler pulled an arm tendon and developed foot drop. Post-production was handled by Montreal's Meteor Studios and Hybride Technologies filled in the bluescreen footage with more than 1,500 visual effects shots. Visual effects supervisor Chris Watts and production designer Jim Bissell created a process dubbed \\"The Crush,\\" which allowed the Meteor artists to manipulate the colors by increasing the contrast of light and dark. Certain sequences were desaturated and tinted to establish different moods. Ghislain St-Pierre, who led the team of artists, described the effect: \\"Everything looks realistic, but it has a kind of a gritty illustrative feel.\\" Various computer programs, including Maya, RenderMan, and RealFlow, were used to create the \\"spraying blood\\". The post-production lasted for a year and was handled by a total of ten special effects companies. Soundtrack In July 2005, composer Tyler Bates began work on the film, describing the score as having \\"beautiful themes on the top and large choir,\\" but \\"tempered with some extreme heaviness\\". The composer had scored for a test scene that the director wanted to show to Warner Bros. to illustrate the path of the project. Bates said that the score had \\"a lot of weight and intensity in the low end of the percussion\\" that Snyder found agreeable to the film. The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and features the vocals of Azam Ali. A standard edition and a special edition of the soundtrack containing 25 tracks was released on March 6, 2007, with the special edition containing a 16-page booklet and three two- sided trading cards. The score has caused some controversy in the film composer community, garnering criticism for its striking similarity to several other recent soundtracks, including James Horner and Gabriel Yared's work for the film Troy. The heaviest borrowings are said to be from Elliot Goldenthal's 1999 score for Titus. \\"Remember Us,\\" from 300, is identical in parts to the \\"Finale\\" from Titus, and \\"Returns a King\\" is similar to the cue \\"Victorius Titus\\". On August 3, 2007, Warner Bros. Pictures acknowledged in an official statement: Promotion and release Lena Headey at the London premiere, 2007 The official 300 website was launched by Warner Bros. in December 2005. The \\"conceptual art\\" and Zack Snyder's production blog were the initial attractions of the site. Later, the website added video journals describing production details, including comic-to-screen shots and the creatures of 300. In January 2007, the studio launched a MySpace page for the film. The Art Institutes created a micro-site to promote the film. At Comic-Con International in July 2006, the 300 panel aired a promotional teaser of the film, which was positively received. Despite stringent security, the trailer was subsequently leaked on the Internet. Warner Bros. released the official trailer for 300 on October 4, 2006, and later on it made its debut on Apple.com where it received considerable exposure. The background music used in the trailers was \\"Just Like You Imagined\\" by Nine Inch Nails. A second 300 trailer, which was attached to Apocalypto, was released in theaters on December 8, 2006, and online the day before. On January 22, 2007, an exclusive trailer for the film was broadcast during prime-time television. The trailers have been credited with igniting interest in the film and contributing to its box-office success. In April 2006, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment announced its intention to make a PlayStation Portable game, 300: March to Glory, based on the film. Collision Studios worked with Warner Bros. to capture the style of the film in the video game, which was released simultaneously with the film in the United States. The National Entertainment Collectibles Association produced a series of action figures based on the film, as well as replicas of weapons and armor. Warner Bros. promoted 300 by sponsoring the Ultimate Fighting Championship's light heavyweight champion Chuck Liddell, who made personal appearances and participated in other promotional activities. The studio also joined with the National Hockey League to produce a 30-second TV spot promoting the film in tandem with the Stanley Cup playoffs. In August 2006, Warner Bros. announced 300 release date as March 16, 2007, but in October the release was moved forward to March 9, 2007. An unfinished cut of 300 was shown at Butt-Numb-A-Thon film festival on December 9, 2006. 300 was released on DVD, Blu-ray Disc, and HD DVD on July 31, 2007, in region 1 territories, in single-disc and two-disc editions. 300 was released in single-disc and steelcase two-disc editions on DVD, BD and HD DVD in region 2 territories beginning August 2007. On July 21, 2009, Warner Bros. released a new Blu-ray Disc entitled 300: The Complete Experience to coincide with the Blu-ray Disc release of Watchmen. This new Blu-ray Disc is encased in a 40-page Digibook and includes all the extras from the original release as well as some new ones. These features include a picture-in-picture feature entitled The Complete 300: A Comprehensive Immersion, which enables the viewer to view the film in three different perspectives. This release also includes a digital copy. An Ultra HD Blu-ray edition of the film was released on October 6, 2020.https://comicbook.com/gear/news/zack-snyders-300-is-up-for-pre-order- on-4k-ultra-hd-blu-ray/ On July 9, 2007, American cable channel TNT bought the rights to broadcast the film from Warner Bros. TNT started airing the film in September 2009. Sources say that the network paid between $17 million and just under $20 million for the broadcasting rights. TNT agreed to a three-year deal instead of the more typical five-year deal. ReceptionBox office= 300 was released in North America on March 9, 2007, in both conventional and IMAX theaters. It grossed $28,106,731 on its opening day and ended its North American opening weekend with $70,885,301, breaking the record held by Ice Age: The Meltdown for the biggest opening weekend in the month of March and for a Spring release. Since then 300s Spring release record was broken by Fast and Furious and 300s March record was broken by Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. 300 opening weekend gross is the 24th-highest in box office history, coming slightly below The Lost World: Jurassic Park but higher than Transformers. It was the third-biggest opening for an R-rated film ever, behind The Matrix Reloaded ($91.8 million) and The Passion of the Christ ($83.8 million). The film also set a record for IMAX cinemas with a $3.6 million opening weekend. The film grossed $456,068,181 worldwide. 300 opened two days earlier, on March 7, 2007, in Sparta, and across Greece on March 8. Studio executives were surprised by the showing, which was twice what they had expected. They credited the film's stylized violence, the strong female role of Queen Gorgo which attracted a large number of women, and a MySpace advertising blitz. Producer Mark Canton said, \\"MySpace had an enormous impact but it has transcended the limitations of the Internet or the graphic novel. Once you make a great movie, word can spread very quickly.\\" =Critical response= Since its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 14, 2007, in front of 1,700 audience members, it received a standing ovation at the public premiere, it was panned at a press screening hours earlier, where many attendees left during the showing and those who remained booed at the end. As of October 2020, on Rotten Tomatoes the film had an approval rating of 61% based on 234 reviews, with an average rating of 6.12/10. The site's critical consensus read, \\"A simple-minded but visually exciting experience, full of blood, violence, and ready-made movie quotes.\\" As of October 2020, on Metacritic, the film had an weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A–\\" on an A+ to F scale. Some of the most unfavorable reviews came from major American newspapers. A. O. Scott of The New York Times describes 300 as \\"about as violent as Apocalypto and twice as stupid,\\" while criticizing its color scheme and suggesting that its plot includes racist undertones; Scott also poked fun at the buffed bodies of the actors portraying the Spartans, declaring that the Persian characters are \\"pioneers in the art of face-piercing\\", but that the Spartans had access to \\"superior health clubs and electrolysis facilities\\". Kenneth Turan writes in the Los Angeles Times that \\"unless you love violence as much as a Spartan, Quentin Tarantino or a video-game-playing teenage boy, you will not be endlessly fascinated\\". Roger Ebert gave the film a 2 out of 4 rating, writing, \\"300 has one-dimensional caricatures who talk like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud.\\" Some critics employed at Greek newspapers have been particularly critical, such as film critic Robby Eksiel, who said that moviegoers would be dazzled by the \\"digital action\\" but irritated by the \\"pompous interpretations and one-dimensional characters\\". Variety's Todd McCarthy describes the film as \\"visually arresting\\" although \\"bombastic\\" while Kirk Honeycutt, writing in The Hollywood Reporter, praises the \\"beauty of its topography, colors and forms\\". Writing in the Chicago Sun- Times, Richard Roeper acclaims 300 as \\"the Citizen Kane of cinematic graphic novels\\". Empire gave the film three out of five, writing, \\"Visually stunning, thoroughly belligerent and as shallow as a pygmy's paddling pool, this is a whole heap of style tinged with just a smidgen of substance.\\" Comic Book Resources' Mark Cronan found the film compelling, leaving him \\"with a feeling of power, from having been witness to something grand\\". IGN's Todd Gilchrist acclaimed Zack Snyder as a cinematic visionary and \\"a possible redeemer of modern moviemaking\\". =Accolades= At the MTV Movie Awards 2007, 300 was nominated for Best Movie, Best Performance for Gerard Butler, Best Breakthrough Performance for Lena Headey, Best Villain for Rodrigo Santoro, and Best Fight for Leonidas battling \\"the Über Immortal\\", but only won the award for Best Fight. 300 won both the Best Dramatic Film and Best Action Film honors in the 2006–2007 Golden Icon Awards presented by Travolta Family Entertainment. In December 2007, 300 won IGN's Movie of the Year 2007, along with Best Comic Book Adaptation and King Leonidas as Favorite Character. The movie received 10 nominations for the 2008 Saturn Awards, winning the awards for Best Director and Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film. In 2009, National Review magazine ranked 300 number 5 on its 25 \\"Best Conservative Movies of the Last 25 Years\\" list. ControversyHistorical inaccuracies= In the actual historical event, by the time of the Battle of Thermopylae the Spartans had already entered into an alliance with other Greek poleis against the Persians. Like during the Battle of Marathon 10 years before in 490, the time of Xerxes's invasion of Greece coincided with a Spartan religious festival, the Carneia, in which the Spartans were not permitted to make war. Still, realizing the threat of the Persians, and not wanting to appear as Persian sympathizers, the Spartan government—rather than Leonidas alone—decided to send Leonidas with his personal 300-strong bodyguard to Thermopylae.Herodotus 7.206. Other Greek poleis joined the 300 Spartan men, totaling somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 total Greek troops. The historical consensus among both ancient chroniclers and current scholars was that Thermopylae was a clear Greek defeat; the Persian invasion would be pushed back in later ground and naval battles. Since few records about the actual martial arts used by the Spartans survive aside from accounts of formations and tactics, the fight choreography led by stunt coordinator and fight choreographer Damon Caro, was a synthesis of different weapon arts with Filipino martial arts as the base. This can be seen in the blade work and the signature use of the off hand by Arnis/Kali/Eskrima in the offensive use of the shields. The Spartans' use of the narrow terrain, in those particular circumstances, is a military tactic known as \\"defeat in detail\\". Paul Cartledge, Professor of Greek History at Cambridge University, advised the filmmakers on the pronunciation of Greek names, and said they \\"made good use\\" of his published work on Sparta. He praises the film for its portrayal of \\"the Spartans' heroic code\\", and of \\"the key role played by women in backing up, indeed reinforcing, the male martial code of heroic honour\\", while expressing reservations about its West' (goodies) vs 'East' (baddies) polarization\\". Cartledge writes that he enjoyed the film, although he found Leonidas' description of the Athenians as \\"boy lovers\\" ironic, since the Spartans themselves incorporated institutional pederasty into their educational system. Ephraim Lytle, assistant professor of Hellenistic History at the University of Toronto, said 300 selectively idealizes Spartan society in a \\"problematic and disturbing\\" fashion, as well as portraying the \\"hundred nations of the Persians\\" as monsters and non- Spartan Greeks as weak. He suggests that the film's moral universe would have seemed \\"as bizarre to ancient Greeks as it does to modern historians\\". Lytle also commented: \\"Ephialtes, who betrays the Greeks, is likewise changed from a local Malian of sound body into a Spartan outcast, a grotesquely disfigured troll who by Spartan custom should have been left exposed as an infant to die. Leonidas points out that his hunched back means Ephialtes cannot lift his shield high enough to fight in the phalanx. This is a transparent defence of Spartan eugenics, and convenient given that infanticide could as easily have been precipitated by an ill-omened birthmark.\\" Victor Davis Hanson, National Review columnist and former professor of Classical history at California State University, Fresno, who wrote the foreword to a 2007 re-issue of the graphic novel, said the film demonstrates a specific affinity with the original material of Herodotus in that it captures the martial ethos of ancient Sparta and represents Thermopylae as a \\"clash of civilizations\\". He remarks that Simonides, Aeschylus, and Herodotus viewed Thermopylae as a battle against \\"Eastern centralism and collective serfdom\\", which opposed \\"the idea of the free citizen of an autonomous polis\\". He also said the film portrays the battle in a \\"surreal\\" manner, and that the intent was to \\"entertain and shock first, and instruct second\\". Touraj Daryaee, now Baskerville Professor of Iranian History and the Persian World at the University of California, Irvine, criticized the film's use of classical sources, writing: > Some passages from the Classical authors Aeschylus, Diodorus, Herodotus and > Plutarch are split over the movie to give it an authentic flavor. Aeschylus > becomes a major source when the battle with the \\"monstrous human herd\\" of > the Persians is narrated in the film. Diodorus' statement about Greek valor > to preserve their liberty is inserted in the film, but his mention of > Persian valor is omitted. Herodotus' fanciful numbers are used to populate > the Persian army, and Plutarch's discussion of Greek women, specifically > Spartan women, is inserted wrongly in the dialogue between the \\"misogynist\\" > Persian ambassador and the Spartan king. Classical sources are certainly > used, but exactly in all the wrong places, or quite naively. The Athenians > were fighting a sea battle during this. Robert McHenry, former editor-in-chief of Encyclopædia Britannica and author of How to Know said the film \\"is an almost ineffably silly movie. Stills from the film could easily be used to promote Buns of Steel, or AbMaster, or ThighMaster. It's about the romanticizing of the Spartan 'ideal', a process that began even in ancient times, was promoted by the Romans, and has survived over time while less and less resembling the actual historical Sparta.\\" The director of 300, Zack Snyder, stated in an MTV interview that \\"the events are 90 percent accurate. It's just in the visualization that it's crazy... I've shown this movie to world-class historians who have said it's amazing. They can't believe it's as accurate as it is.\\" Nevertheless, he also said the film is \\"an opera, not a documentary. That's what I say when people say it's historically inaccurate\\". He was also quoted in a BBC News story as saying that the film is, at its core \\"a fantasy film\\". He also describes the film's narrator, Dilios, as \\"a guy who knows how not to wreck a good story with truth\\". In an interview 300 writer Frank Miller said, \\"The inaccuracies, almost all of them, are intentional. I took those chest plates and leather skirts off of them for a reason. I wanted these guys to move and I wanted 'em to look good. I knocked their helmets off a fair amount, partly so you can recognize who the characters are. Spartans, in full regalia, were almost indistinguishable except at a very close angle. Another liberty I took was, they all had plumes, but I only gave a plume to Leonidas, to make him stand out and identify him as a king. I was looking for more an evocation than a history lesson. The best result I can hope for is that if the movie excites someone, they'll go explore the histories themselves. Because the histories are endlessly fascinating.\\" Dr. Kaveh Farrokh, in a paper entitled \\"The 300 Movie: Separating Fact from Fiction\\", notes that the film falsely portrays \\"the Greco-Persian Wars in binary terms: the democratic, good, rational 'Us' versus the tyrannical, evil and irrational, 'other' of the ever-nebulous (if not exotic) 'Persia. He highlights three points regarding the contribution of the Achaemenid Empire to the creation of democracy and human rights. \\"The founder of the Achaemenid Empire, Cyrus the Great, was the world's first emperor to openly declare and guarantee the sanctity of human rights and individual freedom\\", \\"Cyrus was a follower of the teachings of Zoroaster, the founder of one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions\\", and to put his own words in action \\"When Cyrus defeated King Nabonidus of Babylon, he officially declared the freedom of the Jews from their Babylonian captivity. This was the first time in history that a world power had guaranteed the survival of the Jewish people, religion, customs and culture.\\" He abolished slavery. The Persians really used elephants in combat, but not during the first two wars against the Greeks; historical sources say that the first time the Greeks encountered elephants was in the battle of Gaugamela, won by Alexander the Great, one hundred and fifty years later. Moreover, it is absolutely impossible that Persians used African rhinoceros like that shown in the film, also given the impossibility of training them for any purpose, as borne out by animal behavior's scientists. According to the Spartan tradition, newborns were inspected and discarded in case of deformity or weakness, but they were not pushed down a cliff as shown in the film. =General criticism= Before the release of 300, Warner Bros. expressed concerns about the political aspects of the film's theme. Snyder relates that there was \\"a huge sensitivity about East versus West with the studio\\". Media speculation about a possible parallel between the Greco-Persian conflict and current events began in an interview with Snyder that was conducted before the Berlin Film Festival. The interviewer remarked that \\"everyone is sure to be translating this [film] into contemporary politics\\". Snyder replied that, while he was aware that people would read the film through the lens of current events, no parallels between the film and the modern world were intended. Outside the current political parallels, some critics have raised more general questions about the film's ideological orientation. The New York Posts Kyle Smith wrote that the film would have pleased \\"Adolf's boys,\\" and Slate's Dana Stevens compares the film to The Eternal Jew, \\"as a textbook example of how race-baiting fantasy and nationalist myth can serve as an incitement to total war. Since it's a product of the post-ideological, post-Xbox 21st century, 300 will instead be talked about as a technical achievement, the next blip on the increasingly blurry line between movies and video games.\\" Roger Moore, a critic for the Orlando Sentinel, relates 300 to Susan Sontag's definition of \\"fascist art\\". Newsday critic Gene Seymour, on the other hand, stated that such reactions are misguided, writing that \\"the movie's just too darned silly to withstand any ideological theorizing\\". Snyder himself dismissed ideological readings, suggesting that reviewers who critique \\"a graphic novel movie about a bunch of guys... stomping the snot out of each other\\" using words like neocon,' 'homophobic,' 'homoerotic' or 'racist are \\"missing the point\\". Snyder, however, also admitted to fashioning an effeminate villain specifically to make young straight males in the audience uncomfortable: \\"What's more scary to a 20-year-old boy than a giant god-king who wants to have his way with you?\\". Slovenian critic Slavoj Žižek pointed out that the story represents \\"a poor, small country (Greece) invaded by the army of a much large[r] state (Persia),\\" suggesting that the identification of the Spartans with a modern superpower is flawed. 300 writer Frank Miller said: \\"The Spartans were a paradoxical people. They were the biggest slave owners in Greece. But at the same time, Spartan women had an unusual level of rights. It's a paradox that they were a bunch of people who in many ways were fascist, but they were the bulwark against the fall of democracy. The closest comparison you can draw in terms of our own military today is to think of the red-caped Spartans as being like our special-ops forces. They're these almost superhuman characters with a tremendous warrior ethic, who were unquestionably the best fighters in Greece. I didn't want to render Sparta in overly accurate terms, because ultimately I do want you to root for the Spartans. I couldn't show them being quite as cruel as they were. I made them as cruel as I thought a modern audience could stand.\\" Michael M. Chemers, author of \\"With Your Shield, or on It': Disability Representation in 300\\" in the Disability Studies Quarterly, said that the film's portrayal of the hunchback and his story \\"is not mere ableism: this is anti-disability\\". Frank Miller—commenting on areas where he lessened the Spartan cruelty for narrative purposes—said: \\"I have King Leonidas very gently tell Ephialtes, the hunchback, that they can't use him [as a soldier], because of his deformity. It would be much more classically Spartan if Leonidas laughed and kicked him off the cliff.\\" =Iranian criticism= Some interpreted the portrayal of King Xerxes (right) as homosexual. Snyder said of Xerxes: \\"What's more scary to a 20-year-old boy than a giant god-king who wants to have his way with you?\\" From its opening, 300 also attracted controversy over its portrayal of Persians. Officials of the Iranian government denounced the film. Some scenes in the film portray demon-like and other fictional creatures as part of the Persian army, and the fictionalized portrayal of Persian King Xerxes I has been criticized as effeminate. Critics suggested that this was meant to stand in stark contrast to the portrayed masculinity of the Spartan army. Steven Rea argued that the film's Persians were a vehicle for an anachronistic cross-section of Western aspirational stereotypes of Asian and African cultures. The film's portrayal of ancient Persians caused a particularly strong reaction in Iran. Various Iranian officials condemned the film. The Iranian Academy of the Arts submitted a formal complaint against the film to UNESCO, labelling it an attack on the historical identity of Iran. The Iranian mission to the U.N. protested the film in a press release, and Iranian embassies protested its screening in France, Thailand, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The film was banned within Iran as \\"hurtful American propaganda\\". Reviewers in the United States and elsewhere \\"noted the political overtones of the West-against-Iran story line and the way Persians are depicted as decadent, sexually flamboyant and evil in contrast to the noble Greeks\\". With bootleg versions of the film already available in Tehran with the film's international release and news of the film's surprising success at the U.S. box office, it prompted widespread anger in Iran. Azadeh Moaveni of Time reported, \\"All of Tehran was outraged. Everywhere I went yesterday, the talk vibrated with indignation over the film\\". Newspapers in Iran featured headlines such as \\"Hollywood declares war on Iranians\\" and \\"300 Against 70 Million\\" (Iran's population). Ayende-No, an independent Iranian newspaper, said that \\"[t]he film depicts Iranians as demons, without culture, feeling or humanity, who think of nothing except attacking other nations and killing people\\". Four Iranian Members of Parliament have called for Muslim countries to ban the film, and a group of Iranian film makers submitted a letter of protest to UNESCO regarding the film's misrepresentation of Iranian history and culture. Iran's cultural advisor to president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has called the film an \\"American attempt for psychological warfare against Iran\\". Moaveni identified two factors which may have contributed to the intensity of Iranian indignation over the film. First, she describes the timing of the film's release, on the eve of Norouz, the Persian New Year, as \\"inauspicious\\". Second, Iranians tend to view the era depicted in the film as \\"a particularly noble page in their history\\". Moaveni also suggests that \\"the box office success of 300, compared with the relative flop of Alexander (another spurious period epic dealing with Persians), is cause for considerable alarm, signaling ominous U.S. intentions\\". According to The Guardian, Iranian critics of 300, ranging from bloggers to government officials, have described the movie \\"as a calculated attempt to demonise Iran at a time of intensifying U.S. pressure over the country's nuclear programme\\". An Iranian government spokesman described the film as \\"hostile behavior which is the result of cultural and psychological warfare\\". Moaveni reported that the Iranians she interacted with were \\"adamant that the movie was secretly funded by the U.S. government to prepare Americans for going to war against Iran\\". In popular culture 300 has been spoofed in film, television, and other media, and spawned the \\"This is Sparta!\\" internet meme. Skits based upon the film have appeared on Saturday Night Live and Robot Chicken, the latter of which mimicked the visual style of 300 in a parody set during the American Revolutionary War, titled \\"1776\\". Other parodies include an episode of South Park named \\"D-Yikes!\\", the short film United 300 which won the 2007 MTV Movie Spoof Award, and \\"BOO!\\" by Mad magazine in its September 2007 issue #481, written by Desmond Devlin and illustrated by Mort Drucker. 20th Century Fox released Meet the Spartans, a spoof directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Universal Pictures once planned a similar parody, titled National Lampoon's 301: The Legend of Awesomest Maximus Wallace Leonidas. 300, particularly its pithy quotations, has been \\"adopted\\" by the student body of Michigan State University (whose nickname is the Spartans), with chants of \\"Spartans, what is your profession?\\" becoming common at sporting events starting after the film's release, and Michigan State basketball head coach Tom Izzo dressed as Leonidas at one student event. Nate Ebner, a football player with the New England Patriots in the National Football League and formerly with the Ohio State Buckeyes, was nicknamed \\"Leonidas,\\" after the Greek warrior-king hero of Sparta acted by Gerard Butler in the movie 300, because of his intense workout regimen, and his beard. Sequel In June 2008, producers Mark Canton, Gianni Nunnari and Bernie Goldmann revealed that work had begun on a sequel to 300, 300: Rise of an Empire. Legendary Pictures had announced that Frank Miller started writing the follow-up graphic novel, and Zack Snyder was interested in directing the adaptation, but moved on to develop and direct the Superman reboot Man of Steel. Noam Murro directed instead, while Zack Snyder produced. The film focused on the Athenian admiral, Themistocles, as portrayed by Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton. The sequel, 300: Rise of an Empire, was released on March 7, 2014.

Granovsky was born in Oryol, Russia. He studied at the universities of Moscow and Berlin, where he was profoundly influenced by Hegelian ideas of Leopold von Ranke and Friedrich Karl von Savigny. He felt that the Western history was superior to that of his own country and became the first Russian to deliver courses on the medieval history of Western Europe (1839). Due to the strict censorship of the period, Granovsky assumed that lecturing provided a surer way of disseminating Western ideals in Russia than writing. His major printed work was his doctoral dissertation of 1849, Abbat Sugerii (Abbot Suger), in which he \\"portrayed the great abbot as the architect of royal centralization.\\"Edward Alan Cole, \\"Timofei Nikolaevich Granovsky,\\" Russian Literature in the Age of Pushkin and Gogol: Prose (Gale Research, 1999; ), p. 173. His master's thesis of 1845, \\"Volin, Yumsberg, i Vineta\\" (Wolin, Jomsborg, and Vineta), attempted to disprove the historicity of Vineta and was very controversial, offending the Slavophiles. His readings in the Moscow University were immensely popular and brought him in touch with other Westernizers. One of these, Alexander Herzen, described Granovsky's lectures as \\"a draught of freedom in Nicholas I's Russia\\". Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel The Possessed features a character, Stepan Trofimovich Verkhovensky, that is partly based on Granovsky. According to Cole, this \\"liberal who unwittingly inspired a generation of nihilists is unfair to Granovsky but is nevertheless another tribute to his importance as an inspiring teacher and a man of his age.\\"Cole, \\"Timofei Nikolaevich Granovsky,\\" p. 175.

There are multiple contradictory dates assigned to his birth. According to tradition, he lived c. 459–529 CE. However, in 1919, a Jain monk named Jinvijay pointed out that given his familiarity with Dharmakirti, a more likely choice would be sometime after 650. In his writings, Haribhadra identifies himself as a student of Jinabhadra and Jinadatta of the Vidyadhara Kula. There are several, somewhat contradictory, accounts of his life. He wrote several books on Yoga, such as the Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya and on comparative religion, outlining and analyzing the theories of Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Life story The earlier stories of life of Haribhadra born in Dharmapuri, which dates to the 18th century, says that he was an educated Bhramin who made that he would become a pupil of anyone who stated a sentence which he could not understand After hearing a Jain nun named Yākinī Mahattarā recite a verse that he could not understand, he was sent to her teacher Jinabhaṭa, who promised Haribhadra that he would instruct him if Haribhadra accepted initiation into Jainism. Haribhadra agreed, and took the name Yākinīputra (Spiritual Son of Yākinī). The second account, which bears similarities to the story of Akalanka Digambara, also shows the state of relations between Buddhist and Jain mendicants at the time. In this story, Haribhadra was teaching two of his nephews. These nephews went to secretly study logic at a Buddhist temple, and fled after being discovered there. One of them was killed by the Buddhists, and the other died of grief later. Haribhadra engaged the monks of this monastery in a philosophical debate, and emerged victorious. He then ordered the losing monks to jump into a vat of hot oil. When Haribhadra's own teacher heard of this, he ordered Haribhadra to undertake severe penances for his unseemly display of anger and attachment. Haribhadra did so, and took the title \\"Virahānka\\", which means \\"having separation (or viraha, from his nephews) as a distinguishing characteristic\\". Tradition ascribes some 1440 different works to him. A more creditable number is in the vicinity of 100, some of which are among the most highly regarded works in Jainism. Scholar H.R. Kapadia attributes eighty-seven works to Haribhadra, Jinavijaya attributes twenty-six and Sukh lal Sanghvi attributes forty-seven. Some have even suggested that, based on the language and subject material of the books ascribed to Haribhadra, there were two Haribhadras, the first of which, Haribhadra Virahānka, may have lived around the sixth century, and the second, Haribhadra Yākinīputra, was a monk who lived in a temple around the eighth century. Scholars of the Svetambara community itself tend to hold with the belief that there was only one Haribhadra. Among his important teachings were tolerance for other traditions, and that ultimate reality can be grasped from multiple different perspectives. Philosophy and Influence With his writings, he established that Sanskrit, rather than Prakrit, would be the language of Jain study. He used his only familiarity with the techniques of brahminical study and wrote in the same style. He is also noted for the great respect he displays toward other religious traditions. He even did what few other Jain scholars have done, and wrote a commentary on the Nyāyapraveśa, a text by Śaṅkarasvāmin on the form of Indian logic formulated by the Buddhist scholar Dignāga. He does however ultimately support Jain thought, arguing that the other beliefs tend to display only a one-sided view of the greater reality. He tried to combine the good points of various religious philosophies that existed in his times for spiritual liberation in his work Yogadrstiamuccaya. Haribhadra promoted a form of religious pluralism, perennialism and a respect for different religious traditions. He writes that though they have different names, the teachings of those who have achieved liberation (moksha, nirvana, kevala) are grounded on a common truth. He wrote: \\"Perhaps the teaching is one, but there are various people who hear it. On account of the inconceivable merit it bestows, it shines forth in various ways.\\"Chapple, Christopher; Reconciling Yogas: Haribhadra's Collection of Views on Yoga, 2003, page 8 Works Among his other works are: * Anekāntajayapatākā [The Victory Banner of Anekantavada (Relativism)] - which puts forward arguments about Anekantavada * Ashtakaprakarana (The Eightfold Explanation) * Dharmabindu - which outlines the duties of the laity, outlines rules for mendicants, and describes the bliss of moksha * Dhūrtākhyāna (The Rogue's Stories). * Pañcāśaka - a Prakrit work on rituals and spiritual matters * Ṣaḍdarśanasamuccaya (Compendium of Six Philosophies) - which compares Jainism with other schools of Indian philosophy * Samarāiccakahā (The Story of Samarāicca) - a narrative which outlines the effects of karma in a story about the enmity of its characters which endures over several reincarnations * Sāstravārtāsamuccaya (The Array of Explanatory Teachings) * Yogabindu (The Seeds of Yoga) - a work on yoga * Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya (An Array of Views on Yoga) - another work on yoga * Yogaśataka - a third work on yoga. In these three volumes, he compares the yoga of Jainism with the other varieties of yoga prevalent in India at the time. * Sanmatti Prakaran Notes References  Great Thinkers of the Eastern World (1995), I.P.McGreal (ed.), Harper Collins, New York. *Wiley, Kristi L.

It is situated on the West of England Main Line, down the line from . The main station opened in 1860 but a smaller station on the lower line opened in 1862. It was closed in 1966 but was reopened in 1983 following local community pressure. It is currently operated by South Western Railway. History The old goods shed The Salisbury and Yeovil Railway (S&YR;) opened the second part of its line on 7 May 1860, extending westwards from Gillingham through Templecombe to . The S&YR; never operated any trains, which were provided by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR). On 3 February 1862, the Dorset Central Railway opened its own Templecombe Lower station as the terminus of a line which connected with the Somerset Central Railway's line from ; on 31 August 1863 this was extended beneath the S&YR; line to join up with the remainder of that Dorset company's line to Bournemouth. By now the two 'Central' companies had joined together as the Somerset and Dorset Railway. From November 1875 this became the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&DJR;), which was partly owned by the LSWR, and in January 1878 the LSWR also bought the S&YR.; The junction arrangements between the two railway lines changed over the years The two railway lines were initially linked by a north- to-east curve; trains from the S&DJR; reversed and ran along a separate line next to the single-track Templecombe to Gillingham line to reach the Upper station to allow passengers to connect with main line trains. In March 1870 this connection was closed and a new north-to-west curve was opened that brought S&DJR; trains directly to a third platform at the Upper station; this allowed the S&YR; line to be doubled. A second locomotive was coupled to the back of the train to facilitate the reversals necessary to move the S&DJR; trains in and out of the station. In January 1887 the Lower station was closed and replaced by Templecombe Lower Platform a little further south, but since 1867 many S&DJR; trains had called only at the Upper station. The original Lower station was absorbed into the goods yard and locomotive depot. On 20 July 1874 the S&DJR;'s Bath Extension was opened, connecting it to the Midland Railway at . This northern connection brought more traffic to Templecombe where interchange could be made with the LSWR network in Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall. A large goods yard was needed to handle this traffic, and it was placed on the north side of the LSWR line to the west of the LSWR (or Upper) station. Goods for the Templecombe area were always handled in a separate goods yard and goods shed on the south side of the line; the main station offices were also on this side of the line. The LSWR became a part of the Southern Railway in 1923 as a result of the Railways Act 1921. In 1938 the station was modernised, a footbridge replaced the subway and the platforms were extended to cope with trains 14 coaches long. An ambulance train was stationed at Templecombe during World War II and kept in constant readiness to move casualties from ports on the south coast to military hospitals. On 5 September it was needed to treat casualties at Templecombe station itself. Three bombs were dropped while two trains were standing in the station. Five railwaymen and eight passengers were killed, and many more were injured. =Closure and reopening= The \\"new\\" footbridge which was used from 1983 to 2012 to reach the reopened platform In 1948, the Southern Railway was nationalised to become the Southern Region of British Railways. Two years later, the former goods and locomotive facilities were rationalised. All locomotives were concentrated in the Lower yard, and goods traffic was exclusively handled in the Upper yard. 1958 saw the S&DJR; line north of Templecombe transferred to the Western Region, and in 1963 all lines west of followed. Following these changes, most trains were transferred to other routes. Goods traffic at Templecombe ceased on 5 April 1965 and the Lower Platform was closed on 3 January 1966. The S&DJR; route was closed on 7 March 1966 along with the Upper station. The station buildings were demolished in 1968, but the signal box was retained, and from April 1967, the line from Templecombe to Gillingham reverted to a single track. The first suggestion of reopening the station came in 1975, and Somerset County Council carried out a survey of people living in and around the village to establish whether such a move would be supported by area residents. The results were encouraging, and an approach was later made to British Rail. In 1978, the council stated that £12,000 a year would be needed to subsidise the service, a figure that it could not then afford. The local community formed the Templecombe Station Working Committee (TSWC) to campaign for the reopening. On 5 September 1982, the TSWC arranged for a train to to call to test the demand for a service, and 270 passengers bought tickets. More trains were called on an experimental basis, and tickets were sold for a total of 2,273 passengers. Each time a train called at the station, it had to be manned by members of the TSWC, and temporary lighting had to be provided if they called when it was dark. The ticket office built in 2012 It was finally agreed that the station could be reopened on a three-year trial. The cost of works was kept to just £9,200 by TSWC members carrying out much of the work themselves. Reopening came on 3 October 1983. The services proved so successful that a new waiting shelter was provided in 1988, and an extension with toilets was added two years later. A 'new' footbridge was erected to connect the platform with the car park; it had originally been erected in 1893 at . The signal box doubles as a ticket office, and for many years the station was staffed full-time because of the need for a member of staff to operate the points and signals for the double track west of the station. After the commissioning of a new signalling system, controlled from Basingstoke, in March 2012, ticket office staffing hours were reduced. However, because the platform was only accessible by crossing the track, staff were still required to operate a level crossing for wheelchair users and other passengers unable to use the footbridge. To resolve this, the disused platform on the south side, where there is level access to the car park and streets beyond, was extended out across the disused trackbed up to the active set of tracks, and was provided with a basic shelter and lighting, an automatic ticket machine, and information boards. Signalling Points and signals were initially controlled form the trackside, but eventually five signal boxes controlled movements: * Templecombe A – Upper station L&SWR; opened in 1875 * Templecombe B – Upper station S&DJR; * Templecombe No 3 Junction — junction between the original S&DJR; main line to the north and the new 1870 spur to the Upper station * Templecombe No 2 Junction — junction between the new spur to the Upper station and a link back down to the S&DJR; main line * Templecombe No 1 Junction – junction between the link line from No 2 Jcn and the S&DJR; main line and the south. The No 1 Jcn box was closed in 1887 and after that the former S&DJR; main line between it and No 3 Jcn became a dead-end, accessed only from No 3 Jcn and serving the S&DJR; loco shed and lower yard. In 1933, the B box was closed and the frame in the A box was altered (and possibly extended) to control the S&DJR; movements. In the same year the No 3 Jcn box was closed and its functions transferred to the No 2 Jcn box, in which the lever-frame was extended. A new 60-lever signal box was provided a few years later at the Upper station as part of the station modernisation, opening on 15 May 1938. It was situated at the west end of the Up platform where the signalman had a good view of the goods yards and the junction between the S&DJR; platform and the main lines. When the station was closed the box was retained, and from 1967 it controlled the end-on junction between the single track to Gillingham, and the double track to , with its lever-frame being shortened to just 16 levers. When the station reopened a part of the box was modified to act as a ticket office with a single member of staff acting as both signal operator and ticket office clerk. Signalling on the line between Salisbury and Exeter was modernised in 2011/12 and a system for controlling the line remotely at the main Basingstoke Area Signalling Centre was installed. This was commissioned in February and March 2012, followed by the decommissioning of the line's signal boxes and a significant cut in ticket office hours at Templecombe. Locomotive sheds S&DJR; locomotive shed 1962 The first locomotive shed was opened by the Dorset Central Railway by the Lower station in 1863. This was also used by the LSWR until they opened their own shed in the Upper yard in 1867. The LSWR shed had been demolished by 1936 but locomotives were still kept here until 1950, out based from . The S&DJR; shed had in the meantime been enlarged and took over responsibility for all locomotives in the area until it too closed in 1966. The S&DJR; shed had a turntable. Its allocation was typically about 15 locomotives, with an 82G shed code in Western Region days. Description The station has two platforms, one on each side of a single track, but only the platform on the south side of the line is open to passengers. This has a ticket office and a shelter and is adjacent to the car park. The platform on the north side of the line is no longer in use for passengers but it is the location for a former waiting room and the 1938-built signal box which are used by the Friends of Templecombe Station. A footbridge connects the two platforms but has a locked gate to prevent public access. The opposite side of this platform is where the S&DJR; trains to Bath and Bournemouth used to reverse after connecting with trains on the Exeter to London line. The area once occupied by the large Upper Yard beyond the signal box is now overgrown by trees. Services South Western Railway operate hourly services to London Waterloo and . Locomotives named Templecombe 159003 Templecombe calls at Templecombe station The first locomotive to carry the Templecombe name was a West Country Class 4-6-2 steam locomotive number 34098. It was built at Brighton in 1949 but, despite its West Country name, spent most of its early years working from or . In later years it was allocated to Exmouth Junction and would have been seen regularly on trains through its named town. It was withdrawn in June 1967. The next locomotive to receive the name was Class 33 Bo-Bo diesel-electric number 33112. This was named at Templecombe on 17 October 1987. The name was then transferred to Class 47 Co-Co number 47708 in June 1991. Both these locomotives worked passenger trains on the line. When locomotive-hauled trains were replaced by Class 159 three-car diesel multiple units new Templecombe nameplates were fitted to 57875, the centre car of unit 159003, in a ceremony at the station on 3 October 1993.

Ilovaysky graduated from the Moscow University in 1854 and first attracted critical attention with his thesis on the Principality of Ryazan in 1858. He was wounded during the Siege of Plevna, in which he took an active part. In the 1870s, Ilovaysky started publishing his extensive overview of Russian history.

He was the founding chair of the Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (1998–2003) and was the Richard Perry University Professor at the University of Pennsylvania (2007–2016). Biography A student of Eric Wolf and influenced by the work of French social theorists Pierre Bourdieu and Michel Foucault, he is considered an important proponent of neo-Marxist theory and of critical medical anthropology.. His most recent book Righteous Dopefiend was co-authored with Jeff Schonberg and was published in June, 2009 by the University of California Press in their “Public Anthropology” series. The book won the 2010 Anthony Leeds Prize for Urban Anthropology. Bourgois' previous book was based on five years living with his family next to a crack house in East Harlem during the mid-1980s through the early 1990s: In Search of Respect: Selling Crack in El Barrio. It won the 1996 C. Wright Mills Award and the 1997 Margaret Mead Award among others. Many of his books and articles have been translated for foreign publication. He has also conducted research in Central America on ethnicity and social unrest and is the author of Ethnicity at Work: Divided Labor on a Central American Banana Plantation (1989) which was based on two years of living in the workers' barracks of a Chiquita Brands banana plantation spanning the borders of Costa Rica and Panama. Bourgois received a bachelor's degree in social studies from Harvard College in 1978. He was awarded a master's degree in development economics (1980) and a Ph.D. in anthropology (1985) from Stanford University. He spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris in 1985–1986. In graduate school he worked for the Agrarian Reform ministry in Nicaragua (1980) during the Sandinista revolution and was a human rights activist on Capitol Hill advocating against military aid to the government of El Salvador in 1982. His first academic job was as assistant professor in the Anthropology Department at Washington University in St. Louis (1986–1988) followed by 10 years at San Francisco State University (1988–1998) and a decade at the University of California, San Francisco. He has also been a Fulbright Research professor in Costa Rica (1993–1994) and a visiting scholar at the Russel Sage Foundation (1990–1991), the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (2003–2004), and the School for Advanced Research in Santa Fe (2012–2013). He received the Guggenheim Foundation prize in 2013. Publications In addition to his three ethnographies Bourgois has published five edited volumes, including Violence in War and Peace (2004 Blackwell), co- edited with Nancy Scheper-Hughes and most recently, \\"Violence at the Urban Margins\\" (2015 Oxford), co-edited with Javier Auyero and Nancy Scheper-Hughes. He published an ethnographic study of East Harlem crack dealers, In Search of Respect: Selling Crack in East Harlem (Cambridge University Press. 1995). Bourgois is also the author of over 150 academic and popular press articles addressing segregation in the U.S. inner city, homelessness, gender violence, immigration and labor conflict, substance abuse, HIV, and intimate violence. He also published an article on his father's escape from Auschwitz (\\"Missing the Holocaust\\"). =In Search of Respect: Selling Crack in El Barrio= Bourgois' ethnographic research of the crack dealers and their families revealed the structural barriers that marginalized the minority group of Puerto Ricans, and how their violent street culture further isolated them from mainstream society.Bourgois, Phillippe 2003 In search of Respect. Cambridge University Press. The violent street culture was necessary for them to gain respect within their own marginalized groups. Many of the drug dealers did, in fact, want to enter the legal workforce, however, they were often subject to prejudice and with their lack of education and gap in employment history when they were selling drugs, they were often rejected or could only get jobs at minimum wage. Many subsequently returned to the drug trade.Bourgois, Phillippe 2003 In search of Respect. Cambridge University Press. = Righteous Dopefiend = Opioid addiction in San Francisco, California is explored by Bourgois and photographer Jeff Schonberg in their 2009 photo-ethnography Righteous Dopefiend wherein the two observe, photograph, and critically analyze a group of homeless heroin addicts from November 1994 through December 2006 (Bourgois 4). The ethnography takes a humanistic approach to counter action against opioid addiction in the California region by attempting to redefine the perception of opioid addiction and humanize the experiences of addicts by illustrating the presence of inequality, violence, racism, suffering, and complex power relations within the San Francisco drug scene. Bourgois writes: “The central goal of this photo-ethnography… is to clarify the relationship between large-scale power forces and intimate ways of being in order to explain why the United States, the wealthiest nation in the world, has emerged as a pressure cooker for producing destitute addicts embroiled in everyday violence” (Bourgois 5).

Boris Alexandrovich Rybakov (Russian: Бори́с Алекса́ндрович Рыбако́в, 3 June 1908, Moscow – 27 December 2001) was a Soviet and Russian historian who personified the anti-Normanist vision of Russian history. He is the father of Indologist Rostislav Rybakov.  Life and works  Rybakov held a chair in Russian history at the Moscow University since 1939, was a deputy dean of the university in 1952-54, and administered the Russian History Institute for 40 years. His first groundbreaking monograph was the Handicrafts of Ancient Rus (1948), which sought to demonstrate the economic superiority of Kievan Rus to contemporary Western Europe. Rybakov led important excavations in Moscow, Novgorod, Zvenigorod, Chernigov, Pereyaslav, Tmutarakan and Putivl and published his findings in numerous monographs, including Antiquities of Chernigov (1949), The Chronicles and Bylinas of Ancient Rus (1963), The First Centuries of Russian history (1964), The Tale of Igor's Campaign and Its Contemporaries (1971), Muscovite Maps of the 15th and early 16th Centuries (1974), and Herodotus' Scythia (1979). In the latter book he viewed the Scythians described by Herodotus as ancestors of modern Slavic nations. In his older years, Rybakov attempted to reconstruct the pantheon and myths of Slavic religion. He outlined his ideas in Ancient Slavic Paganism (1981) and Ancient Paganism of Rus (1987). Some of these reconstructions have been heavily criticized as far-fetched.Leo Klejn. Воскрешение Перуна. К реконструкции восточнославянского язычества. СПб., 2004. С. 70.

Exact lengths are relatively easy to determine with modern maps and imagery so as to include recent glacial retreat. Measurements are from recent imagery, generally supplemented with Russian 1:200,000 scale topographic mapping as well as Jerzy Wala,Orographical Sketch Map: Karakoram: Sheets 1 & 2, Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, Zurich, 1990. It is located in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. It runs through part of the Karakoram mountain range. The Baltoro Muztagh lies to the south and east of the glacier, while the Masherbrum Mountains lie to the south. At 8,611 m (28,251 ft), K2 is the highest mountain in the region, and three other Eight thousanders within 20 km.Concordia K2 Trek The glacier gives rise to the Braldo River which is a tributary of Shigar River, which is a tributary of the Indus River. Several large tributary glaciers feed the main Baltoro Glacier, including the Godwin Austen Glacier, flowing south from K2; the Abruzzi and the various Gasherbrum Glaciers, flowing from the Gasherbrum group of peaks; the Vigne Glacier, flowing from Chogolisa, and the Yermandendu Glacier, flowing from Masherbrum. The confluence of the main Baltoro Glacier with the Godwin Austen Glacier is known as Concordia; this location and K2 base camp are popular trekking destinations. The trough of this glacier is very wide. Small valley glaciers form icefalls where they meet the trunk glacier. The sidewalls vary from very steep to precipitous. The glacier has carved striations on the surrounding country rocks. Moving ice has formed depressions, which serve as basins for numerous glacial lakes. The glacier can be approached via the Balti town of Skardu. List of peaks A list of notable peaks adjacent to or near the Baltoro Glacier includes: * K2, 2nd highest in the world at 8611m * Gasherbrum I, 11th highest in the world at 8,080m. * Broad Peak, 12th highest in the world at 8,047m. * Gasherbrum II, 13th highest in the world at 8,035m. * Gasherbrum III, 7,946m. (Often regarded as a subpeak of Gasherbrum II.) * Gasherbrum IV, 17th highest in the world at 7,932m. * Masherbrum (K1), 22nd highest in the world at 7,821m. * Chogolisa, 36th highest in the world at 7,665m. * Muztagh Tower, 7,273m. * Snow Dome, 7,160m. * Biarchedi, 6,781 m * Uli Biaho Tower, 6,417m. * Trango Towers, 6,286m.

Background Woolsey was born on January 29, 1835 into the wealthy, influential New England Dwight family, in Cleveland, Ohio. Her father was John Mumford Woolsey (1796–1870) and her mother Jane Andrews, and author and poet Gamel Woolsey was her niece. She spent much of her childhood in New Haven Connecticut after her family moved there in 1852. Woolsey worked as a nurse during the American Civil War (1861–1865), after which she started to write. She never married, and resided at her family home in Newport, Rhode Island, until her death. She edited The Autobiography and Correspondence of Mrs. Delaney (1879) and The Diary and Letters of Frances Burney (1880). She is best known for her classic children's novel What Katy Did (1872). The fictional Carr family was modeled after her own, with Katy Carr inspired by Woolsey herself. The brothers and sisters were modeled on her four younger siblings: Jane Andrews Woolsey, born October 25, 1836, who married Reverend Henry Albert Yardley; Elizabeth Dwight Woolsey, born April 24, 1838, who married Daniel Coit Gilman and died in 1910; Theodora Walton Woolsey, born September 7, 1840; and William Walton Woolsey, born July 18, 1842, who married Catherine Buckingham Convers, daughter of Charles Cleveland Convers.

It uses an EF mount, and is compatible with the Canon EOS camera range. It has a focal length of 1200 mm and so on a digital body with a sensor size of 22.5 mm × 15 mm (called 1.6× crop), such as a Canon EOS 40D or 450D, it provides a 35 mm field of view equivalent to that of a 1920 mm lens. With a body with a sensor size of 28.8 mm × 19.2 mm (called 1.3× crop), such as a Canon EOS-1D Mark IV, the field of view is equivalent to that of a 1560 mm lens. The lens was aimed at sports and wildlife photographers, and is both extremely expensive and extremely rare. Canon described it as \\"the world’s largest interchangeable SLR AF lens, in terms of both focal length and maximum aperture.\\"Canon Europe product page Technical information The EF 1200mm 5.6L USM is a professional L-series lens, that is now discontinued. The lens was first developed for the Canon FD mount, although never marketed until after Canon had transitioned to the EF mount. According to a Canon USA representative interviewed in 2009, the lens made its first public appearance at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles; Canon had shipped five copies of the lens for media use at the Games. All of the FD 1200mm 5.6L lenses were eventually shipped back to Canon in Japan. Later in the 1980s, these lenses were converted to the EF mount. When used at the Los Angeles Olympics the lenses were fitted with built in 1.4x teleconverters. The official website of Canon competitor Nikon implies that these lenses, with the built-in 1.4x teleconverter, were also used by photographers covering baseball games, including the very popular high school tournaments, at Japan's Koshien Stadium. Nikon developed a 1200–1700mm manual-focus super telephoto zoom, specifically designed for use at that stadium, in order to compete with Canon's offering. This lens is constructed with a metal body and mount, and with plastic extremities and switches. The features of the lens are: a wide rubber focus ring that is damped, a distance window with infrared index, the ability to limit the focus range, a focus-preset mechanism, and the ability to set the AF speed. The maximum aperture of 5.6 gives this lens the ability to create depth of field effects. The optical construction of the lens contains 13 lens elements, including two large fluorite lens elements. The lens uses an inner focusing system, powered by a ring type USM motor. Manual focusing is rendered by wire: the lens does not have a direct mechanical connection to the focusing ring, instead detecting rotation of the focusing ring and using the lens motor to drive the lens elements. The manual focus speed is adjustable: 1 = 1/2 standard (for precision), 2 = standard and 3 = 2x standard (for fast- moving subjects). The front of the lens does not rotate nor extend when focusing. It does not have a typical rotating tripod mount like other telephoto lenses. However, the lens mount can be rotated and locked, allowing the lens to be used in horizontal and vertical shot formats. It is compatible with the Canon Extender EF teleconverters. The lens uses a small slot to insert filters near the base of the lens, similar to other super-tele lenses, rather than the conventional attachment at the end of the barrel. The lens came with its own heavy-duty tripod and case. The lens was only available for special \\"pre orders\\", and was never built before selling; its annual production volume was approximately two lenses. The lens also took more than a year to construct, due to the time required to grow its massive fluorite crystals. Few of these lenses exist; Canon has never released production figures, but it is almost certain that fewer than 100 were made, and it has been rumored that the actual number is closer to 20. A list of owners has also never been made public, but reported owners include Sports Illustrated magazine (two); Canon Professional Services (two); James Jannard, the billionaire founder of Oakley and RED Digital Cinema (two); and the National Geographic Society (at least one for its magazine). It is also widely believed that several intelligence and law enforcement agencies own this lens. This lens has been offered for public sale three times in the 21st century: * In 2009, the New York-based B&H; Photo Video retailer sold this lens for US$120,000. * In August 2014 a British dealer, MPB Photographic, offered this lens for £99,000 (slightly over $165,000 at the time) with VAT included. * B&H; offered this lens again in April 2015, this time for $180,000.

It was published for the first time on 22 July 1956 and is compiled every week by the Official Charts Company (OCC) on Fridays (previously Sundays). It is broadcast on BBC Radio 1 (top 5) and published in Music Week magazine (top 75), and on the OCC website (top 100). To qualify for the Official Albums Chart, the album must be the correct length and price. It must be more than three tracks or 20 minutes long and not be classed as a budget album. A budget album costs between £0.50 and £3.75. Additionally, various-artist compilation albums – which until January 1989 were included in the main album listing – are now listed separately in the \\"Official Compilation Chart\\". Full details of the rules can be found on the OCC website. According to the canon of the OCC, the official British albums chart was the Record Mirror chart from 22 July 1956 to 1 November 1958; the Melody Maker chart from 8 November 1958 to March 1960;Warwick, Neil; Kutner, Jon; Brown, Tony (2004). The Complete Book of the British Charts: Singles and Albums (3rd ed.). London: Omnibus Press. . the Record Retailer chart from 1960 to 1969; and the Official Albums Chart from 1969 on. For eight weeks in February and March 1971 no Official Albums Chart was compiled due to a postal strike - for this period, the OCC uses the chart compiled by Melody Maker instead. In the 1970s the new album chart was revealed at 12:45 pm on Thursdays on BBC Radio 1, and then moved to 6:05 pm (later 6:30 pm) on Wednesday evenings during the Peter Powell and Bruno Brookes shows. In October 1987 it moved to Monday lunchtimes, during the Gary Davies show, and from April to October 1993 it briefly had its show from 7:00–8:00 pm on Sunday evenings, introduced by Lynn Parsons. Since October 1993 it has been included in The Official Chart show from 4:00 – 5:45 pm on Fridays (previously from 4:00 – 7:00 pm on Sundays). A weekly 'Album Chart' show was licensed out to BBC Radio 2 and presented by Simon Mayo, until it ended on 2 April 2007. Though album sales tend to produce more revenue and, over time, act as a greater measure of an artist's success, this chart receives less media attention than the UK Singles Chart, because overall sales of an album are more important than its peak position. 2005 saw a record number of artist album sales with 126.2 million sold in the UK. In February 2015, it was announced that due to the falling sales of albums and rise in popularity of audio streaming, the Official Albums Chart would begin including streaming data from March 2015. Under the revised methodology, the Official Charts Company takes the 12 most streamed tracks from one album, with the top- two songs being down-weighted in line with the average of the rest. The total of these streams is divided by 1000 and added to the pure sales of the album. This calculation was designed to ensure that the chart rundown continues to reflect the popularity of the albums themselves, rather than just the performance of one or two smash hit singles. The final number one album on the UK Albums Chart to be based purely on sales alone was Smoke + Mirrors by Imagine Dragons. On 1 March 2015, In the Lonely Hour by Sam Smith became the first album to top the new streaming-incorporated Official Albums Chart. The first number one on the UK Albums Chart was Songs for Swingin' Lovers! by Frank Sinatra for the week ending 22 July 1956. As of the week ending 22 October 2020, the UK Albums Chart has had 1211 different number one albums. The current number one album is Edna by Headie One. Record holders The most successful artists in the charts depend on the criteria used. As of February 2016, Queen albums have spent more time on the British album charts than any other musical act, followed by The Beatles, Elvis Presley, U2 and ABBA. By most weeks at number one, The Beatles lead with a total of 174 weeks, and the most number one albums of all with 15. The male solo artist with the most weeks at number one is Presley with a total of 66 weeks. Presley also holds the record for the most number one albums by a solo artist (13) and most top ten albums by any artist (53). Madonna has the most number one albums (12) by a female artist in the UK, though this includes the Evita film soundtrack which was a cast recording and not strictly a Madonna album. Adele is the female solo artist with the most weeks at number one, with a total of 37 weeks. Spice Girls are the female group with the most weeks at number one, with a total of 18 weeks for Spice (15 weeks) and Spiceworld (3 weeks). Queen's Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in UK chart history, with six million copies sold as of February 2014. Previous first-place holder The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is now in third-place after being supplanted by Queen and then by ABBA's Gold: Greatest Hits. Both albums have sold in excess of 5.1 million copies. The longest running number one album, both consecutively and non-consecutively, is the soundtrack of the film South Pacific. It had a consecutive run of 70 weeks from November 1958 to March 1960, and had further runs at the top in 1960 and 1961, making a non- consecutive total of 115 weeks. Eminem holds the record for the most consecutive number one albums in Official Albums Chart history, with ten consecutive UK number one albums. The youngest artist to top the chart is Neil Reid, whose debut album topped the chart in 1972 when he was only 12 years old. The oldest living artist to top the charts is Vera Lynn at the age of 92 with We'll Meet Again: The Very Best of Vera Lynn, released in 2009 (though the album only contains material she recorded between 1936 and 1959). Lynn also holds the record for the oldest living artist to have a chart album, with the 2017 release of Vera Lynn 100, released to mark her 100th birthday (though again, this only contains material she recorded decades earlier). The album peaked at number 3. The album which has spent the most weeks on the charts is Queen's Greatest Hits, which has spent over 1000 weeks on the chart by January 2018. See List of albums which have spent the most weeks on the UK Albums Chart for full details. In 1980, Kate Bush became the first British female artist to have a number-one album in the UK with Never for Ever, as well as being the first album by any female solo artist to enter the chart at number 1. In August 2014 she became the first female artist to have eight albums in the Official UK Top 40 Albums Chart simultaneously, (altogether she had eleven albums in the Top 50 in one week). She is currently in fourth place for artists having the most simultaneous UK Top 40 albums, behind Elvis Presley and David Bowie who both tie for the most simultaneous Top 40 albums (twelve each, both immediately following their deaths in 1977 and 2016 respectively), and The Beatles who had eleven in 2009 when remastered versions of their albums were released. The fastest selling album (first chart week sales) is 25 by Adele. Released in November 2015, it sold over 800,000 copies in its first week. The Rolling Stones are the first act to have reached number one in the album chart during six different decades (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2010s and 2020s) though their number ones in the 2010s and 2020s were with reissues of their older albums. For solo artists, Elvis Presley has scored UK number- one albums in five different decades (the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 2000s and 2010s). In 1993, Cliff Richard became the first male solo artist to score UK number-one albums in four consecutive decades (the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s). In 2010, Kylie Minogue became the first female solo artist to have UK number-one albums in four consecutive decades (the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s). The longest number one by a group is Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water which was number one for 33 weeks (13 of which were consecutive). The longest consecutive number one by a group was the Beatles' Please Please Me, which held the top spot for a straight 30 weeks. The longest number one by a male solo artist was Elvis Presley with G.I. Blues which stayed at the top for 22 weeks (his Blue Hawaii album was also the longest consecutive number one album for a male artist with 17 weeks). Adele's album 21 has the most weeks at number one by a female solo artist (and by a solo artist of any gender) with 23 weeks, 11 of which were consecutive (which is also a record for a female artist). The first studio album and non soundtrack or cast recording album to top year-end chart was With the Beatles by The Beatles in 1963, they became the first group to achieve this feat. Elton John's Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player in 1973, marks the first album by male artist and solo act to do so. The fitst woman to reach year-end best seller was Barbra Streisand in 1982, for Love Songs. The first studio album and non soundtrack or cast recording album to top decade-end chart was Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles in 1960s, they became the first group act to achieve this. James Blunt's Back to Bedlam in 2000s, marks the first album by male artist and solo act to do it. Blunt was the only performer in history to top decade chart with debut album. The fitst woman to reach this feat was Adele in 2010s, with 21. Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia holds the record for having the lowest one-week sales while at the top of the chart in the modern era, when it was number one the week beginning 15 May 2020 with sales of only 7,317. =Debut albums= The fastest selling debut albums (first-week sales): * All-time highest sales by a solo female artist is Susan Boyle with I Dreamed a Dream, which sold 411,820 copies in November 2009. * By a band is Arctic Monkeys with Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, which sold 363,735 copies in 2006. * By a solo male act is Craig David with Born to Do It, which sold 225,320 copies in 2000. Sam Smith holds the record for most weeks spent in the Top 10 by a debut album with In the Lonely Hour, with 76, surpassing a record previously held by Emeli Sandé.

Made up of two road bridges and a railway bridge constructed at a part of the river known as the Narrows, located between Mill Point and Point Lewis, it connects the Mitchell and Kwinana Freeways, linking the city's northern and southern suburbs. The original road bridge was opened in 1959 and was the largest precast prestressed concrete bridge in the world. Construction of the northern interchange for this bridge necessitated the reclamation of a large amount of land from the river. The bridge formed part of the Kwinana Freeway which originally ran for only to Canning Bridge. Over the following decades, the freeway system was expanded to the north and south, greatly increasing the volume of traffic using the bridge. As a result, in 2001, a second road bridge was opened to the west of the original bridge, and in 2005, the railway bridge was constructed in the gap between the two traffic bridges. Passenger trains first traversed the Narrows in 2007 with the opening of the Mandurah railway line.  First road bridge: 1959  The original Narrows Bridge under construction, Narrows Bridge under construction The close distance between Mill Point and Point Lewis at the foot of Mount Eliza meant the site was suggested as a suitable location for a bridge as early as 1849. A bridge was proposed for the site in 1899, but its expected cost of £13,000 was deemed too high. Preliminary planning for a bridge at the site finally began in 1947, but was suspended so that a replacement for The Causeway could be built at Heirisson Island, at the city's eastern end.Gregory, p. 107 The new Causeway bridges were opened in 1952, and by 1954 traffic using them to enter the city had doubled, renewing calls for a bridge at the Narrows. Site investigations for the bridge began in August 1954. The bridge was proposed for the Narrows site by the Town Planning Commission under the chairmanship of Harold Boas. The chosen site drew public protest on the basis that the bridge would spoil the view to and from the city. Also, residents of the wealthy Mill Point area were angry that they would have a major highway running beside their houses. The site also necessitated the reclamation of of land from Mounts Bay for the bridge approach and interchange. This land reclamation, which started in October 1954, saw the addition of of sand, much of which was dredged from Melville Water. The state started saving for the new bridge in September 1954, and the construction of the bridge was approved by the Hawke state Labor government in November 1954, before the Hepburn-Stephenson metropolitan roads plan had been finalised, such was the urgency of a new traffic link.Gregory, p. 106 The construction of the bridge was subsequently endorsed in the 1955 Hepburn–Stephenson plan, which later developed into the Metropolitan Region Scheme. The river bed at the site of the proposed bridge was not ideal for bridge building, with soft mud extending down as deep as , with sand beds below that going a further down.\\"Narrows Opening\\", p. 33 Ernie Godfrey, a bridge engineer with the Main Roads Department, travelled overseas to inspect bridges in similar geological locations and to source a designer for the proposed bridge. The design contract for the bridge was won by British engineering firm Maunsell & Co. Construction on the road system began in 1956, and the contract for construction of the bridge was signed by Commissioner of Main Roads J. Digby Leach on 16 March 1957. The bridge was built by Danish firm Christiani and Nielsen in conjunction with Western Australian engineering firm J. O. Clough & Son. Leif Ott Nilsen oversaw construction on behalf of Christiani and Nielsen.\\"Narrows Opening\\", p. 31 The first timber pile for the temporary staging for the construction was driven at noon on 8 June 1957.\\"Narrows Opening\\", p. 34 The first permanent pile for the bridge was driven home on 18 August 1957. Work on the bridge's precast concrete beams began in September 1957, and the first of these was lifted into place by the gantry crane in February 1958. The last river pile was driven home in November 1958, and the final concrete beam was lowered into position in June 1959. During construction on 10 February 1959, John Tonkin, then the Deputy Premier and Minister for Works, announced that the new bridge was to be named the Golden West Bridge. However, Golden West was also the name for a popular soft drink; the proposal encountered scorn from commentators and was quietly dropped.Gregory, p. 108 The bridge cost £1.5 million, as part of a wider road system costing £3.5 million.\\"Narrows Opening\\", p. 25 Construction of the bridge took 2 years and 5 months. It was officially opened by Governor Charles Gairdner on 13 November 1959. He unveiled a plaque on the bridge together with Premier Sir David Brand, Commissioner of Main Roads J. Digby Leach and Works Minister Wild. Gairdner was also the first person to drive across the new bridge. It was hoped at this stage that the debt raised to pay for the bridge would be repaid by the Government within 12 months. The bridge formed part of the new Kwinana Freeway, which originally ran from the Narrows to Canning Highway.\\"Narrows Opening\\", p. 27 This was described as the \\"most modern highway\\" in Western Australia, with a speed limit of . The bridge was also the largest precast prestressed concrete bridge in the world at the time of its opening.Anon. 1959, World's largest precast prestressed concrete bridge completed, Roads and Road Construction, v. 37, n. 444, pp. 364–367. = Design = The bridge was jointly designed by engineering firm G. Maunsell & Partners and architects William Halford & Partners. The prestressed concrete design was relatively new for Western Australia, where road bridges had traditionally been built from timber frameworks. The bridge is arched along its length, with a vertical curve of up to 4% grade. The unusually soft soil conditions at the site forced the use of 160 \\"Gambia piles\\" for the bridge's foundations, named after the country in which they were first used. The diameter piles have steel shells and conical noses. The hollow piles were driven by a drop hammer falling within them, then when they had sufficient resistance to driving, they were filled with reinforced concrete. The piles support two river piers, two shore piers and two abutments. The bridge's support columns on the piers were designed in a triangular form, larger at the top than at the bottom, each carrying two of the bridge's beams, so as to not completely obstruct the view through the bridge's piers. These columns support the bridge's five spans: a central span of , two flanking spans of each and two smaller spans of at each end passing over roadways. The bridge has eight parallel lines of beams. Each line of beams consists of two cantilever spans long suspended between the shore and river piers, a central suspended span long between the two river piers, and two spans suspended over roadways at either end. Suspended between the beams of the bridge were of water mains pipes and of gas and drainage pipes. Footpaths wide on either side of the bridge were formed by concrete cast in situ and cantilevered out from the adjacent beams. These footpaths were separated from the roadway and the bridge's edge by lightweight aluminium balustrades and safety fences installed by Bristile.\\"Narrows Opening\\", p. 29 The street lights were integrated into the safety fence. The deck of the bridge was formed by pre-casting individual concrete units on the southern river shore, then hoisting them into place on temporary timber staging in the river. The units were then structurally joined by strands of high-tensile wire and stretched with a hydraulic jack. These pre-stressing strands were anchored in reinforced concrete blocks at the ends of the spans. The new bridge had a traffic capacity of 6,000 cars per hour in each direction,\\"Narrows Opening\\", p. 30 over a total of six traffic lanes. = Post-completion history = Strengthening works were carried out on the bridge by Structural Systems Ltd in 1996. Also in 1996, decorative night lighting was installed on each side of the bridge. The bridge was entered on the state's heritage register on 8 January 1999, and was named a national engineering landmark by the Institution of Engineers, Australia, in November 1999. The opening of the southern regions of Perth to easier CBD access changed the nature of the metropolitan area, prompting dramatic population growth south of the river. This led to increased traffic on the bridge, causing regular traffic jams in peak hour. Over the years, governments suggested various ideas to reduce the traffic using the bridge, including introducing congestion pricing similar to that used in Singapore, charging vehicles to enter the central business district during peak periods. The government also encouraged voluntary car sharing. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, and by the 1990s, the bridge had become the city's worst traffic bottleneck, despite the addition of an extra traffic lane, bringing the total number of lanes to seven.  Second road bridge: 2001  Plans for a second Narrows Bridge were mooted during the 1970s, but did not eventuate. By 1998, the original bridge was carrying 155,000 vehicles per day, with an average of 2,700 cars per lane between 7:30 am and 8:30 am, and was thought to be the busiest section of freeway in Australia. This quantity of traffic far outstripped the expected capacity of the bridge when it opened in 1959. In 1998, The road planners' most favoured solution to the traffic problem was to widen the existing bridge by building a smaller second traffic bridge just west of it and joining their decks to form a contiguous roadway. This would increase the number of traffic lanes from seven to ten. The widening was expected to cost $50 million. A plan to widen the Narrows Bridge was announced on 13 April 1998 by the Court Liberal State Government. The $70 million plan would involve the addition of four extra traffic lanes, and was part of a $230 million package upgrading and extending the southern end of the Kwinana Freeway. Alannah McTiernan, then the Opposition transport spokesperson, attacked the plan, saying that the government should instead build a railway to Rockingham. Instead of widening the existing structure, the Minister for Transport, Eric Charlton, on 15 July 1998 approved the construction of a separate second road bridge alongside the original Narrows Bridge; this solution would cost $15 million less, due to new building techniques, and would be less disruptive to traffic on the existing bridge. The construction of a separate bridge was also deemed necessary because the foundations of any new structure might settle in the soft river bed at a different rate from the existing bridge. Under the plan, there would be six lanes on each bridge, including a bus lane on each. The new bridge would run parallel to the original bridge and be separated from it by a gap of , and was designed to look largely the same as the original. Main Roads called for tenders for the bridge widening in July 1998, and on 7 March 1999 it was announced that the building contract had been awarded to Leighton Contractors. The negotiated contract price was reduced to $49 million owing to the construction method proposed by Leighton. The designers were Connell Wagner. The bridge was constructed by the incremental launching technique, with segments pre-cast on both shores and pushed out into place as the construction progressed. The bridge was divided into two strips lengthways, with the eastern half launched separately from the western half, and the two decks were later joined at the bridge's centre line. The first of twelve segments was launched in February 2000. As it was being launched, the bridge rested on temporary piles; only after the structure was fully launched were these piles removed and the bridge allowed to rest on its permanent supports. The construction required the driving of around 250 steel piles; the first was driven on 10 August 1999. Construction of the second bridge was interrupted several times by strikes,See, e.g., as well as by an algal bloom in the Swan River. The bridge was finally opened to traffic on 26 February 2001, and officially opened by new Transport Minister Alannah McTiernan (a strident critic of the project) on 30 May 2001. The bridge had originally been planned to be opened in August 2000, and was expected to carry 80,000 cars per day. The new traffic bridge carried six lanes of traffic, including one bus lane, and the original bridge was modified at this time to carry six traffic lanes, as designed.  Railway bridge: 2005  During the construction of the second road bridge, the construction of a railway through Perth's southern suburbs to Rockingham and Mandurah became a political issue.See, e.g., The incumbent Liberal state government proposed building a railway from Kenwick to connect to the Kwinana Freeway, running in the centre of the freeway for only part of its journey. The Labor opposition instead wanted to build the railway across the Narrows Bridge and down most of the length of the freeway. After the Labor party won the 2001 state election, it reversed the previous government's position and started planning for the installation of railway tracks across the Narrows Bridge. The construction of a third bridge was needed due to the lack of previous planning provisions when the second bridge was constructed. Leighton Constructions won the contract to build the freeway stage of the railway line and set about constructing a narrow southbound railway bridge in the gap between the existing road bridges. The designers of \\"Package E\\" of the Southern Suburbs Railway (which included the Narrows Rail Bridge) were GHD, Coffey Geosciences and Wyche Consulting. The eastern side of the existing northbound (2001) bridge was also strengthened to accommodate the northbound railway track. Construction was due to start in July 2005 and completion was expected by December 2005. The first passengers traversed the Narrows on 23 December 2007 with the opening of the Mandurah Railway Line. The railway bridge deck was made from nine steel girders each weighing up to and up to long. These girders were built in Kwinana, brought to the site by road and lowered into position with a crane. The bridges viewed from the west at sunset.

In the early 2nd century BC, Adikhalamani (Tabriqo), the Kushite king of Meroë, started its construction by building a small single-room chapel dedicated to the god Amun. It was built and decorated in a similar design to the later Meroitic chapel on which the Temple of Dakka is based. Later, during the reigns of Ptolemy VI, Ptolemy VIII, and Ptolemy XII of the Ptolemaic dynasty, it was extended on all four sides to form a small temple, , which was dedicated to Isis of Philae. The Roman emperors Augustus and Tiberius completed its decorations.Dieter Arnold, Temples of the Last Pharaohs, Oxford University Press, 1999. p.193 From the quay, there is a long processional way leading to the stone-built enclosure wall, through three stone pylon gateways, and finally to the temple itself.

Compared to a photo of the original site, the gateway topped by a serpent-flanked sun was not the closest gateway to the temple proper. It constitutes one of the few works of ancient Egyptian architecture that can be seen outside Egypt and the only one of its kind in Spain. Following remarks made by several Egyptologists criticising the fact that unlike other donated temples, the structure continues to be exposed to the elements, the Madrilenian city council made a unanimous decision to accelerate plans to finally cover the monument in February 2020.

Photo by Karl Bulla Sergey Fyodorovich Platonov () (28 June [16 June, Old Style], 1860 - 10 January 1933) was a Russian historian who led the official St Petersburg school of imperial historiography before and after the Russian Revolution. Life and career Platonov was born in Chernigov and attended a private gymnasium in St. Petersburg until 1878 when he went to the Department of History and Philology of St. Petersburg University until 1882. He was a student of Konstantin Bestuzhev-Ryumin, who recommended that he be given the opportunity to \\"prepare to be a professor.\\" Platonov belonged to the \\"St. Petersburg school\\" of Russian historiography, which paid special attention to the study and publication of historical sources. Platonov gained his master's thesis in 1888 writing about Old Russian Legends and Tales About the Seventeenth-Century Time of Troubles as a Historical Source for which he gained the Uvarov Award of the Academy of Sciences. Platonov's scholarly career was centered on the University of St Petersburg, where he was held in highest repute for his detailed studies of the Time of Troubles (1923) and Oprichnina. Platonov's history textbooks, impeccably written and easily readable, enjoyed such popularity that he was asked by the tsar to teach history to his children. In 1909, he was admitted to the Russian Academy of Sciences. Unlike some of his disciples (such as Alexander Presnyakov), Platonov did not change his views after the Revolution and stood aloof from the mainstream Marxist historiography, as represented by Mikhail Pokrovsky. Nevertheless, he was permitted to administer the Archaeographic Commission in 1918-29, the Pushkin House (i.e., the Russian Literature Institute) in 1925–1929 and the Academy's Library in 1925–1928. On 12 January 1930 Platonov was accused of taking part in a royalist conspiracy, arrested and exiled to Samara, where he died three years later. However, a number of his historical works continued to be reprinted later in the decade, and in 1967 he was formally rehabilitated.

She was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, as Henrietta Kanengeiser. By her early 20s, she had taken the surname Carnegie as an homage to Andrew Carnegie, the richest man in the United States at the time. Early life and career Born to a poor Jewish family, she was the second of seven children born to Hannah (née Kranczer) and Isaac Kanengeiser. When she was a young girl, her family immigrated to the United States, settling in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. She attended public school until her father died in 1902. In order to help support her family, she took a job as a messenger at Macy's at age 13. At age 15, she modeled and trimmed hats at a millinery manufacturer. alt= Hat by Hattie Carnegie, shown in Suit, hat and blouse by Hattie Carnegie, shown in Ladies Home Journal, 1948 In 1909, she launched a hat-making business with Rose Roth. Roth was a dressmaker and Carnegie designed hats. By 1919, Roth had left the business and Carnegie was the sole proprietor of Hattie Carnegie, Inc. At this point, Carnegie had a working capital of $100,000. She began travelling to Paris to buy original dresses to both sell in her shop and use as inspiration for her own designs. In 1925, Carnegie was successful enough to buy a building just off Park Avenue at 42 East 49th Street. By 1929, the business has sales of $3.5 million a year. When spending decreased during the Great Depression, Carnegie created a less expensive line called Spectator Sports. In 1928, a then-unknown Lucille Ball began working for Carnegie as an in-house model. Carnegie ordered Ball to dye her then-brown hair blonde, and Ball complied. Of this time in her life, Ball said, \\"Hattie taught me how to slouch properly in a $1,000 hand-sewn sequin dress and how to wear a $40,000 sable coat as casually as rabbit.\\" Later, Ball moved back to New York City in 1932 to resume her pursuit of a career as an actress and supported herself by again working for Carnegie and as the Chesterfield cigarette girl. Carnegie could not sew or cut a pattern herself, but she had an eye for talent. Her company discovered some of the most prominent American fashion designers of the twentieth century, such as Norman Norell, Pauline Trigère, , Jean Louis, James Galanos, and Clare McCardell. For nearly a decade, the made-to-order department was headed by Pauline Fairfax Potter. In response to the austerity measures of World War II, Carnegie designed a dress for home sewers that was published in the April 12, 1943, issue of Life magazine. Made to order by Carnegie, the dress was said to cost $175, but Life readers could make their own for as little as $5. Carnegie's specialty was \\"the little Carnegie suit\\". In 1950, she was invited to apply her design sense to the Women's Army Corps (WAC) uniform. This was adopted for wear on New Year's Day 1951. On June 1, 1952, Carnegie received the Congressional Medal of Freedom for the WAC uniform design and for her many other charitable and patriotic contributions.Hattie Carnegie Facts The WAC design was so timelessly elegant that it was still in use for women's U.S. Army uniforms in 1968.The Army Green Uniform by Stephen J.

This power has become known as \\"the corporations power\\", the extent of which has been the subject of numerous judicial cases. Jurisprudence to 1971 After the High Court's decision in Huddart, Parker & Co Ltd v Moorehead (1909), the \\"corporations\\" power was largely ignored as a basis for Commonwealth legislation. The majority judges agreed in this case that the power should be construed narrowly, though they were unable to agree on any appropriate interpretation. Their approach reflected the perceived need to protect \\"the reserved powers of the States\\", an idea abandoned in 1920 as a result of the Engineer' case.. Justice Issacs dissent in Huddart, Parker gave a broad meaning to s 51(xx) but attempted to set limits to the power, in particular pointing out: :* it is exerciseable wherever these specific objects are found, irrespective of whether they are engaged in foreign or interstate commerce, or commerce confined to a single State :* the power is to operate only on corporations of a certain kind, namely, foreign, trading, and financial corporations :* it is not a power to create or dissolve corporations :* it is not restricted to internal company regulation :* it is concerned with the regulation of the conduct of the corporations in their transactions with, or as affecting, the public It was not until Huddart Parker was overruled in Strickland v Rocla Concrete Pipes Ltd that the modern development of the power began. In that case, the leading judgment was delivered by Chief Justice Barwick, who, although agreeing that Isaacs' dissent in Huddart Parker conformed to the reasoning in Engineers, refused to define the scope of the corporations power. He stated instead that \\"the decision as to the validity of particular laws yet to be enacted must remain for the Court when called upon to pass upon them\\". Corporations subject to the power The High Court in New South Wales v Commonwealth (1990) (the Incorporation Case) confirmed that the ambit of the corporations power extends only to corporations that have already been formed, and, therefore, it does not include the power to incorporate them. It extends only to domestic corporations of a trading or financial character, and to all corporations formed outside Australia, and they are collectively referred to as \\"constitutional corporations\\". In most of the early cases, the question of what aspects or activities of a corporation can be regulated under s 51(xx) was not directly addressed. Some incidental points were clarified in R v Australian Industrial Court; Ex parte CLM Holdings Pty Ltd. That case established that, where the activities of a s 51(xx) corporation were validly regulated, the conduct of individual persons taking part in those activities, such as company directors, could incidentally be regulated as well. In Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd, the Court still did not deal directly with the regulation of a corporation's activities. The whole Court upheld a section that protected a corporation against a secondary boycott. The legislative purpose thus upheld was protection of corporations rather than regulation of them. The case also provided an opportunity for extensive discussion of how far the \\"corporations\\" power might extend. The WorkChoices case provides the current definition for the extent of the corporations power, as noted in its majority opinion: :* the regulation of the activities, functions, relationships and the business of the specified types of corporation :* the creation of rights, and privileges belonging to such a corporation :* the imposition of obligations on it :* the regulation of the conduct of those through whom it acts, its employees and shareholders and, also, the regulation of those whose conduct is or is capable of affecting its activities, functions, relationships or business :* including laws prescribing the industrial rights and obligations of corporations and their employees and the means by which they are to conduct their industrial relations Characteristics of trading and financial corporations Whether a corporation falls within the group of \\"trading or financial corporations\\" has been the focus of much attention and debate. The dominant issues revolve around the type of corporation and the nature of the activities that characterise it as falling within s. 51(xx). In that regard: :* A constitutional corporation can be a \\"trading corporation\\" and a \\"financial corporation\\" at the same time :* A \\"trading corporation\\" is one where trading is a substantial or significant part of its activities, and that determination is irrespective of the purpose for which the corporation formed (Quickenden v O'Connor) ::* A trading corporation can be found to exist on the basis of the nature of its established activities (the \\"activities test\\"), or with respect to the objects for which it was incorporated (the \\"purpose test\\") ::* \\"Trading activities\\" are those that involve some form of buying and selling, and generate revenue, regardless of whether carried out at a profit (R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League (\\"Adamson's case\\")) ::* The type of ownership is not materiala State corporation established to generate electricity has been held to be subject to regulation (Tasmanian Dam case) ::* Where a corporation has not yet commenced trading (i.e., a shelf company), it can still be subject to regulation based on its objects of incorporation (Fencott v Muller) ::* however, the High Court, in a controversial ruling, has held that a municipal corporation was to be distinguished from a trading corporation, notwithstanding the fact that it carried out trading activities (R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council ) :* A \\"financial corporation\\" is one that engages in substantial financial activities or intends to do so, but it is not necessary for such activities to be predominant or characteristic of ithowever, a corporation that carries on substantial financial activities in the course of carrying on its primary business will be classified as a financial corporation (State Superannuation Board of Victoria v Trade Practices Commission) See also * WorkChoices * Workplace Relations Act 1996 ReferencesFurther reading  Category:Australian constitutional law ","title":"Section 51(xx) of the Constitution of Australia"},{"id":"2465898","text":"Ademo may refer to: *Euphorbia, a genus of spurges *Ademo, a French rapper with PNL *Ademo Freedman, founder of activist group Cop Block ","title":"Ademo"},{"id":"2465902","text":"Gods In Polyester: A Survivors' Account Of 70's Cinema Obscura is a cult film book covering mainly American obscure, low-budget, and independent film horror, sci-fi, exploitation film, Blaxploitation, Spaghetti Western, and action films that were created between 1970 and 1981.

It is situated off the N69 road between Listowel to the South-West and Tarbert to the North. The village of Knockanure lies to the immediate South. The parish in which the village is located is now also known as the \\"Parish of Moyvane\\". It was originally called the parish of Murhur, this was part of the ancient \\"Barony of Iraghticonnor\\". History The name of \\"Moyvane\\", which in Irish is \\"Maigh Mheain\\" meaning \\"the Middle Plain\\", was adopted by the village in 1939 when a plebiscite was held by Father O'Sullivan, who was the Parish Priest at the time.http://www.moyvane.com/ It is the name of a townland situated about two miles South-West of the actual village itself and this area resembles a flat plain/prairie-like landscape that extends for miles around. Prior to 1939, the village had been called \\"NewtownSandes\\" and is even still referred to, by natives, as \\"Newtown\\" – which is especially true of the older generation. The origin of the name \\"NewtownSandes\\" itself is tempered with pain as it was the village located on the lands of George Sandes when he was alive in the early 1880s. He was a notoriously cruel Landlord (and agent of another) at that time and still tenaciously held on to his estates towards the end of the Land War when most of his peers had already given up theirs. Around 1886, after a forceful eviction of some of his tenants, the name of the village was changed to \\"NewtownDillon\\" after John Dillon. However, this didn't stick and the name remained unchanged until 1916 when another name-change was attempted: this time to \\"NewtownClarke\\" after the 1916 Easter Rising leader Thomas Clarke. Culture The parish of Moyvane emphasises artistic talent in their culture, as well as music, drama, and storytelling. Performances are often held in the Marian Hall. Past performances there have included the well known 'seanchaí' Eddie Lenihan, who told of mythical battles involving the Fianna, as well as recitals by other poets. A number of 'talent' shows have been held in the hall over the years. These shows would often involve comedy sketches. =Boghole Boys= In 2004, Gabriel Fitzmaurice presented a radio show on Radio Kerry called 'The Boghole Boys'. The show aired each Monday night and included stories, songs, music and poems being performed by people from Moyvane, Knockanure and the surrounding parishes. =Poetry= The Moyvane village is perhaps most known for the poets that have come from its parish. The Village Hall is a verse by Gabriel Fitzmaurice which tells the tale of the old shows that took place in the performance hall prior to the new one being established. Willie's Car is a poetic description of a popular village character written by Dan Keane. =Stories and songs= Story-telling is a popular form of drama and expression in Moyvane. Many of the native stories written about the village are produced by the Moyvane poets discussed above. The songs of Moyvane and its surrounding area are many and varied. A collection of some of the songs and ballads that are native to the parish are listed on the village website. SportGAA= The local GAA team has taken the championship in North Kerry 18 times throughout the course of the club's history. Moyvane also served as the setting for the 2005 championship final between Listol and Ballyduff. =Soccer= Moyvane has a soccer club called Newtown Athletic. Sponsored by Speedy's Bar, they play their Kerry District League home games in the Creamery Field – a well maintained pitch right in the heart of downtown Moyvane. The club was promoted last year to Division One. =Badminton= Badminton was first introduced to Moyvane in 1975. The first Club was a Juvenile Club formed by Fr. Brosnan. It was played in the old Marian Hall, and even though the roof was low and the Court size about three-quarters the size of a normal court, the young people of the parish played the new game with enthusiasm, skill and success. In 1976 Moyvane were among the prize winners in the County Championships held in Tarbert. =Basketball= Several basketball players, who have had victories at the county level and some international levels, have come from the village of Moyvane. Many girls from the parish have been involved with All-Ireland winning school teams and have brought many All-Ireland medals to Moyvane. Nature Trail The Moyvane Nature Trail is a project that was created to connect the woods where the Moyvane and Knockanure woods meet. Moyvane is a rural parish in North Kerry bordering West Limerick.It is situated about (7miles) north east of Listowel and south of Tarbert. The North Kerry Walks Committee provided finance for the project as well as appealed to volunteers to make an attack on all the rubbish, fallen trees, and to scrub both woods of briars and bushes commencing on Easter weekend of 1996.http://www.tidytowns.ie/u_reports/2012/2012%20County%20Kerry%20Moyvane%20347.pdf With the help of 145 voluntary hours, the walk was open to the public on 1 June 1996. The walk has been extended to include an alternative route around the perimeter of the GAA pitch , recently it has been further extended to take in a river walk that brings you to a restored Limekiln.

The first motorway (Malmö–Lund) was opened in 1953. The motorways' primary purpose is connecting major cities to their surrounding areas, although there is a long-term ambition to connect Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö with motorways. With the completion of a couple of new motorway stretches in 2006 - 2012 an interconnecting motorway network exists from Öresund Bridge (to Denmark) to the Swedish- Norwegian border and to Gävle north of Stockholm. There are also a number of motortrafikleder (semi- motorways, autostrasse), roads with only 2 or 3 (2+1) lanes but to which the same conditions apply as to motorways (i.e. grade-separated crossings, no slow traffic). These can be converted to motorways by adding a parallel road. This is a complete listing of motorways in Sweden. The Swedish road numbering scheme does not distinguish between motorways and other types of roads. The speed limit on motorways is generally 110 or 120 km/h (68 or 75 mph). Speed limits of 70 and 90 km/h are often used on urban motorways, and electronic signs can show a lower limit in bad weather.

Long-term goals  There are long-term goals in the standard of the major roads, and all new constructed roads should follow this target standard. This target has varied over the years, therefore roads varies somewhat randomly in standard.

From 1839–1844, the historic Spanish fort on the hill was reconstructed and dramatically expanded in brick. This is now termed \\"Fort Barrancas\\". The older, water battery downhill (Bateria de San Antonio, 1787) has been separately named as \\"Fort San Carlos\\".\\"Fort Barrancas\\" (history), National Park Service, 2006, nps.gov webpage: NPSft. It is a remnant from the Spanish fortification, the wooden () Fort San Carlos de Barrancas of the late 18th century. Due to changing requirements, the U.S. Army deactivated Fort Barrancas on April 15, 1947 following World War II. Designated a National Historic Landmark (NHL) in 1960, the fort was transferred to the control and administration of the National Park Service in 1971. After extensive restoration during 1971-1980, Fort Barrancas was opened to the public (see below: Timeline). HistoryConstruction= Fort Barrancas was built on the site of numerous previous forts, including Fort San Carlos de Austria, which was constructed by the Spanish in 1698. It was besieged in 1707 by Indians under the general leadership of some English traders, but was not taken. In 1719 French forces captured Pensacola and destroyed the Spanish fort. Following Britain's defeat of the French in the Seven Years' War, in 1763 it exchanged some territory with Spain and took over West Florida. The British used this site as a harbor fortification, building the Royal Navy Redoubt in 1763. More than a decade later, as enemies of the British, the Spanish joined the war against them in 1779 during the American Revolutionary War, though they never officially became American allies. They took Pensacola in 1781. After the war, the Spanish retook control of West Florida. They completed the fort San Carlos de Barrancas in 1797. Barranca is a Spanish word for bluff, the natural terrain feature that makes this location ideal for the fortress. =First battles under U.S. control= During the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom, the fort was the scene of the American victory at the Battle of Pensacola (1814). This was fought between American forces commanded by General Andrew Jackson as well as some Indian allies, and the allied forces of the British, Spanish, and Creeks. American units raided West Florida. In 1818, the Spanish garrison of the fort exchanged cannon fire with an American battery for a few days. The U.S. force was led by General Jackson. Eventually the Spanish surrendered the fort, leaving Pensacola in American hands. When the United States purchased Florida from Spain in 1821, it selected Pensacola as the site for a major Navy Yard, which was developed around the Spanish Fort Barrancas. In addition, the US developed plans for construction of additional harbor fortifications to protect this deepwater bay. Fort Pickens was completed on Santa Rosa Island in 1834, and Fort McRee was completed in 1839 to defend the pass to Pensacola Bay. Fort Barrancas was reconstructed and expanded with brick between 1839–1844 on its hilltop overlooking the bay. It was strengthened to defend against both ships entering the harbor and attack across land. The Advanced Redoubt was built north of the fort, and a trenchline connected them. This system protected the Navy Yard to the east from infantry attacks. The expanded Fort Barrancas was designed by Joseph Gilbert Totten. It was connected to the Spanish-built water-battery by an underground walkway tunnel. Major William Henry Chase supervised the construction, done mostly by enslaved African- American workers. =American Civil War= Sketch showing 1861 harbor defenses at entrance to Pensacola Bay. The town of Warrington (shown east of Fort Barrancas) was relocated north of Bayou Grande in the 1930s to provide land for Naval Air Station Pensacola. Photos of the fort and its garrison at the outbreak of the Civil War. On January 8, 1861, more than three months before the American Civil War officially started at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, a company of 50 U.S. Army soldiers stationed at Fort Barrancas, under the command of John H. Winder, fired upon a militia of Florida state troops, under Colonel William Henry Chase, who demanded for the U.S. troops to surrender the fort. Lieutenant Adam J. Slemmer, acting commander in Winder's absence, had the troops fire shots meant to repel the militia. Slemmer knew that Fort Pickens was easier to defend and so he spiked the guns at Barrancas, loaded ammunition and supplies on a flatboat, and moved his company across the bay to Fort Pickens. The Union held the fort throughout the Civil War. The Confederacy stationed soldiers from Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi at Fort Barrancas. While a small company of soldiers could man the fort successfully, the Confederate Army fortified the position with additional sand batteries along the coast, to be operated by the garrison. General Braxton Bragg took command of Confederate Pensacola on March 11, 1861, and continued work on the batteries. On October 9, a Confederate force of 1000 troops landed east of Fort Pickens but was repelled by Union forces. Fort McRee and Fort Barrancas exchanged heavy cannon fire with Fort Pickens on November 22–23, 1861 and January 1, 1862. However, in May 1862, after learning that the Union Army had taken New Orleans, Confederate troops abandoned Pensacola. =Aftermath= Stronger, rifled cannon and ironclad ships developed during the Civil War made masonry forts like Fort Barrancas outmoded. The fort was used as a signal station, small arms range, and storage area by the Army until 1946. Newer weapon technology developed during World War II made coastal defense completely obsolete. On April 15, 1947, Fort Barrancas was deactivated. The U.S. Navy incorporated the site into Naval Air Station Pensacola. At the same time, local leaders, Congress, and the National Park Service were working to designate the harbor defenses of Pensacola as a historic national monument. In 1971, Congress authorized the establishment of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, to be managed by the National Park Service. Fort Barrancas was included in this. After a $1.2 million restoration, Fort Barrancas was opened to the public in 1980. Fort Barrancas and the nearby Advanced Redoubt are located on Naval Air Station Pensacola but they are both managed as historic properties by the National Park Service. Access to Naval Air Station Pensacola by non-Department of Defense affiliated personnel may be subject to homeland security and military force protection concerns.  Timeline  Fort Barrancas and its site has changed names several times over the past five centuries, depending on which country ruled in the region: * 1559-1561: The Spanish first settled a portion of Santa Rosa Island, they did not use this hilltop site at all; * 1698: the Spanish constructed Fort San Carlos de Austria on this hilltop; * 1719: Fort San Carlos de Austria was destroyed by the French; * 1763: under British rule, Royal Navy Redoubt is constructed of earth and logs; * 1787: under Spanish rule (from 1781), the sea-level battery, Bateria de San Antonio, is built of masonry; * 1787-1797: under Spanish rule, Fort San Carlos de Barrancas, a wooden and earthen structure, is added on the hill-top bluff overlooking the battery; * 1814: Fort San Carlos de Barrancas is demolished by the evacuating British during the War of 1812 as Andrew Jackson approaches; * 1817: again under Spanish control, San Carlos de Barrancas is rebuilt; * 1839-1844: under U.S. rule following purchase of Florida from Spain (from 1821), the wooden hill-top structure is replaced with a massive brick fortress connected via tunnel to the water-side battery (remodeled in 1838), with the entire site comprising Fort Barrancas; * 1845-1869: the Advanced Redoubt is built 1400 ft (427 m) north of the fort; * 1861: With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Union forces abandoned Fort Barrancas and defended Fort Pickens; Barrancas was taken over by Confederates; the fort was bombarded from Union-held Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island, with heaviest attacks on November 22–23 and January 7, 1862; * 1862: in May after the fall of New Orleans to Union forces, Fort Barrancas and the City of Pensacola were abandoned by Confederate troops (after the fall of New Orleans); * 1870: The Pensacola and Fort Barrancas Railroad, an eight-mile line connecting Pensacola, Florida, with the fort, through Warrington and Woolsey, is constructed during the Reconstruction era to improve infrastructure in the state.Turner, Gregg M., A Journey Into Florida Railroad History, University Press of Florida, Library of Congress card number 2007050375, , page 94. The line had several corporate ownerships before the rail link on Naval Air Station Pensacola was abandoned circa 1979.

Also, he addressed the Russian economy in his writings. Biography A village priest's son, Klyuchevsky studied at Moscow University under Sergey Solovyov, to whose chair he succeeded in 1879. His first important publications were an article on economic activities of the Solovetsky Monastery (1867) and a thesis on medieval Russian hagiography (1871). Kluchevsky was one of the first Russian historians to shift attention away from political and social issues to geographical and economical forces. He was particularly interested in the process of Russian peaceful colonisation of Siberia and the Far East. In 1882, he published his landmark study of the Boyar Duma, whereby he asserted his view of a state as a result of collaboration of diverse classes of society. In 1889, Klyuchevsky was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences. Although his lectures were highly popular with the students of Moscow University, only a few of his works were intended for publication, e.g., a handful of biographies of \\"representative men\\", including Andrei Kurbsky, Afanasy Ordin-Nashchokin, Feodor Rtishchev, Vasily Galitzine, and Nikolay Novikov. The last decade of his life was spent preparing the printed version of his lectures. He also became interested in politics, and joined the Constitutional Democratic Party. Maxim Gorky records the following dictum by Leo Tolstoy: > Karamzin wrote for the tsar, Solovyov wrote lengthily and tediously, and > Klyuchevsky wrote for his own pleasure.

Sundström and Anne Libby, Stockholm, Almqvist and Wiksell, 1971. His 1924 film Diagonal- Symphonie is one of the seminal abstract films in the history of experimental cinema. BiographyEarly career= At the age of sixteen, the orphaned Eggeling moved to Germany to pursue an artistic career. He studied art history in Milan from 1901 to 1907, supporting himself with work as a bookkeeper. From 1907 to 1911, he taught Art at the Hochalpines Lyceum in Zuoz/Institut Engiadina (today Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz) in Switzerland. He lived in Paris from 1911 to 1915, where he was acquainted with Amedeo Modigliani, Hans Arp, Léopold Survage and other artists of the time.Timothy O. Benson et al., Expressionist Utopias, Berkeley, University of California Press, 2001; pp. 198-9. At this point his art was influenced by Cubism, but soon grew more abstract, and in the years 1915–1917, influenced more specifically by the Rythmes colorés of Survage, he started making sketches on scrolls, or \\"picture rolls\\" as he would call them, that he later made into his abstract films Horizontal-Vertikal Messe (now lost) and Diagonal-Symphonie.Daniel Meyer- Dinkgräfe, European Culture in a Changing World: Between Nationalism and Globalism, Cambridge Scholars Press, 2004Daniel Robbins, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, MoMA, 2009 \\"Basse générale de la peinture. Extension\\" Lithography (1919)Dada, Nr. 4/5 (15 May 1919): [p. 8]. =Zurich & Dada= In Zurich in 1918, he re-connected with Hans Arp and took part in several Dada activities, befriending Marcel Janco, Richard Huelsenbeck, Sophie Taeuber, and the other dadaists connected to the Cabaret Voltaire. In 1919 he also joined the group Das Neue Leben (\\"New Life\\"), that was based in Basel and featured Marcel Janco, Hans Arp, Sophie Taeuber, Augusto Giacometti, and others. The group supported an educational approach to modern art, coupled with socialist ideals and Constructivist aesthetics.Sandqvist, p.95-97, 190, 264, 342-343; Van der Berg, p.139, 145-147. See also Cernat, Avangarda, p.130, 155, 160-161 In its art manifesto, the group declared its ideal of \\"rebuild[ing] the human community\\" in preparation for the end of capitalism.Sandqvist, p.96. See also Van der Berg, p.147 In the same year Eggeling was co-founder of the similar group Artistes Radicaux (\\"Radical Artists\\"), a more political section of the Neue Leben group.Van der Berg, p.147-148. See also Cernat, Avangarda, p.160-161 During this time, in 1918, Tristan Tzara introduced him to Hans Richter, with whom he would work intimately for a couple of years, and in 1919 the two of them left Switzerland for Germany. Richter later wrote that \\"The contrast between us, which was that between method and spontaneity, only served to strengthen our mutual attraction...for three years we marched side by side, although we fought on separate fronts.\\"Hans Richter, Dada: Art and Anti-Art, translated by David Britt, London, Thames and Hudson, 1965. \\"Basse générale de la peinture. Extension\\" Lithography (1919)De Stijl, vol. 4, nr. 7 (July 1921): facing p. 112. =Berlin= In Germany his first stop was Berlin, where he met with Raoul Hausmann, Hannah Höch and other radical artists. He here also joined the Novembergruppe (\\"November Group\\"), a radical political group that featured many artists connected to Dada, Bauhaus and Constructivism. After moving to Klein-Kölzig with Richter, he continued his experiments with \\"picture rolls\\". These scrolls were sequences of painted images on long rolls of paper that investigate the transformation of geometrical forms and could be up to 15 meters in length. As they were to be \\"read\\" from left to right, this soon evolved into cinematographic experimentation on film stock. In 1920, Eggeling began producing his first film, Horizontal-Vertikal-Messe, based on a \\"picture roll\\" containing approximately 5000 images. In 1921, he ends his collaboration with Richter and postpones his work on Horizontal-Vertikal-Messe. In 1923 he instead collaborates with Erna Niemeyer and works on Diagonal-Symphonie, a synthesis of image, rhythm, movement and music, created from series of black sheets of paper with cut-out geometrical shapes. This film was completed in 1924 and shown for the first time in November the same year. Its first public screening was in Berlin in May 1925, at the film program \\"Der absolute Film\\", arranged by the Novembergruppe. 16 days later, Eggeling died.

Each bibliogram has three components: * A seed term that sets a context. * Words that co-occur with the seed across some set of records. * Counts (frequencies) by which co-occurring words can be ordered high to low. The term was introduced in 2005 by Howard D. White to name the linguistic object studied, but not previously named, in informetrics, scientometrics and bibliometrics. The noun phrases in the ranking may be authors, journals, subject headings, or other indexing terms. The \\"stretches of text” may be a book, a set of related articles, a subject bibliography, a set of Web pages, and so on. Bibliograms are always generated from writings, usually from scholarly or scientific literature. As a family of term-frequency distributions, the bibliogram has frequently been written about under descriptions such as: * positive skew distribution * empirical hyperbolic * scale-free (see also Scale-free network) * power law * size frequency distribution * reverse-J It is sometimes called a \\"core and scatter\\" distribution. The \\"core\\" consists of relatively few top-ranked terms that account for a disproportionately large share of co-occurrences overall. The \\"scatter” consists of relatively many lower-ranked terms that account for the remaining share of co-occurrences. Usually the top-ranked terms are not tied in frequency, but identical frequencies and tied ranks become more common as the frequencies get smaller. At the bottom of the distribution, a long tail of terms are tied in rank because each co-occurs with the seed term only once. In most cases bibliograms can be described by power laws such as Zipf's law and Bradford's law. In this regard, they have long been studied by mathematicians and statisticians in information science. However, these treatments typically ignore the qualitative meanings of the ranked terms themselves, which are often of interest in their own right. For example, the following bibliogram was made with an author's name as seed and shows the descriptors that co-occur with her name in the ERIC database. The descriptors are ranked by how many of her articles they were used to index: 6 Creativity 4 Creativity Tests 3 Divergent Thinking 2 Elementary School Mathematics 2 Instruction 2 Mathematics Education 2 Problem Solving 2 Research 2 Time 1 Acceleration 1 Anxiety 1 Beginning Teachers 1 Behavioral Objectives 1 Child Development 1 Classroom Techniques 1 Cognitive Development etc. This author is a researcher in education, and it will be seen that the terms profile her intellectual interests over the years. In general, bibliograms can be used to: * suggest additional terms for search strategies * characterize the work of scholars, scientists, or institutions * show who an author cites over time * show who cites an author over time * show the other authors with whom an author is co- cited over time * show the subjects associated with a journal or an author * show the authors, organizations, or journals associated with a subject * show library classification codes associated with subject headings and vice versa * show the popularity of items in the collections of libraries * model the structure of literatures with title terms, descriptors, author names, journal names Bibliograms can be created with the RANK command on Dialog (other vendors have similar commands), ranking options within WorldCat, HistCite, Google Scholar, and inexpensive content analysis software. White suggests that bibliograms have a parallel construct in what he calls associograms. These are the rank-ordered lists of word association norms studied in psycholinguistics. They are similar to bibliograms in statistical structure but are not generated from writings. Rather, they are generated by presenting panels of people with a stimulus term (which functions like a seed term) and tabulating the words they associate with the seed by frequency of co-occurrence. They are currently of interest to information scientists as a nonstandard way of creating thesauri for document retrieval. Examples Other examples of bibliograms are the ordered set of an author's co-authors or the list of authors that are published in a specific journal together with their number of articles. A popular example is the list of additional titles to consider for purchase that you get when you search an item in Amazon. These suggested titles are the top terms in the \\"core\\" of a bibliogram formed with your search term as seed. The frequencies are counts of the times they have been co-purchased with the seed. Examples of associagrams may be found in the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus. Other methods Similar but different methods are used in data clustering and data mining. Google Sets does also create list of associated terms to a given set of terms. See also * Bibliographic coupling * Co-citation References * Howard D.

His name sometimes spelled as Herkhuf, Horkhuf, or Hirkhuf, all that is known of his life comes from the inscriptions in his tomb at Qubbet el-Hawa on the west bank of the Nile at Aswan, near the First Cataract of the Nile. He was a native of Elephantine. Harkhuf served under kings Merenre I, fourth king of the 6th Dynasty (ca. 2255–2246 B.C.), and Pepi II, the last powerful king of the 6th Dynasty (ca. 2246–2152 B.C.). He was appointed governor of Upper Egypt.

He led four major expeditions to Nubia. His written account of these expeditions is the most important source for Egypt's relations with Nubia at this time.Lichtheim p. 23 On the last expedition, he brought back with him what his correspondence with the young pharaoh Pepi II referred to as a dwarf, apparently a pigmy.Vernus, Yoyotte, p.74 He travelled a considerable distance to a land called Iyam, which probably corresponds to the fertile plain that opens out south of modern Khartoum, where the Blue Nile joins the White. However, Jean Yoyotte thought Iyam was located further north in the Libyan Desert.Jean Yoyotte: Pour une localisation du pays de Iam, BIFAO 52 (1953), p.173ff The inscriptions in Harkhuf's tomb reflect changes in the Egyptian world view that were occurring during the Late Old Kingdom and the First Intermediate Period, with the person of the king becoming more human and displaying emotions and interests,Maulana Karenga, Maat, the Moral Ideal in Ancient Egypt: A Study in Classical African Ethics, Routledge 2004. . p.52 while commenting on a person leading a moral life by helping his neighbour: \\"I gave bread to the hungry, clothing to the naked, I ferried him who had no boat.\\"James Henry Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Part One, Chicago 1906, §§ 325 & §328  Tomb inscription  The narration of Harkhuf's career is aforementioned by prayers for offerings and a good burial, and the list of virtues - standardized components of tomb- autobiography. Carved on the outside of the soft, flaking stone of the tomb are fifty-eight lines.Lichtheim Listed below are the descriptions of the inscriptions on each side of the tomb. = Above the entrance (Eight lines) = Harkhuf has prayers for offerings and a good burial. He mentions an \\"offering which the king gives and Anubia.\\"Lichtheim, p.23 This shows his significance and hierarchy in Egypt. Even the king gives an offering, revealing even further. Harkhuf states his titles such as Governor of Upper Egypt, prays for a peaceful journey in the afterlife, and mentions many feasts and that he be celebrated.Lichtheim, p.24 Lastly, a list of his virtues is included, such as never judging between two, helping other civilians, and building a house. This is very similar to the duties of a king; Harkuf, who is a highly esteemed priest has these king-like qualities to him. = Right side of entrance (Fourteen lines) = Harkhuf accounts his expedition to Yam (located in Upper Nubia), the first time with his father, bearing gifts and products. The second trip was done alone where he traveled back through other foreign lands, noting that this has not been done by anyone else before, and again, bearing beautiful gifts. The third trip to Yam, he found that the ruler had gone to Tjemeh-land to smite the Tjemeh; however, Harkhuf was able to please the ruler of Yam, and Yam's ruler praised all the gods.Lichtheim, p. 25 = Left side of entrance (Ten lines) = After satisfying the ruler of Yam, Harkhuf came down through the south of Irtjet and north of Setju. He found their ruler, which was impressed by all of his goods and products as well as the numerous troops from Yam with him, that the ruler escorted him and led him to Irtjet's mountain path.Lichtheim, p.25-26 = On the far right (Twenty-six lines) = Harkhuf's tomb describes the text of a letter he received from the king Neferkare, where he vividly expresses his eagerness to see the pygmy whom Harkhuf was bringing back with him.

He was a founding mainstay member of the Sydney pub rock band The Cockroaches on rhythm guitar and sharing lead vocals. He has written tracks for the children's music group, the Wiggles, including \\"Hot Potato\\". His brothers, Paul Field (later the Wiggles managing director) and Anthony Field (the blue Wiggle), were also bandmates in the Cockroaches. Early life and education John William Michael Field was born on 15 May 1962 in Darlinghurst and grew up in north-western Sydney as one of seven children. Their father, John Patrick Field (1932–98), was a suburban chemist. Their mother, Marie, made sure that they all learned how to play at least one musical instrument. Field attended an all-boys boarding school, St. Joseph's College, alongside his older brother, Paul, and younger brother, Anthony. Field was selected as the Under-19 New South Wales Cricketer of the Year. Anthony has declared that John would have been a professional cricketer if it were not for his success in music. CareerThe Cockroaches and other music projects= In 1979 John Field, on rhythm guitar and co-lead vocals, formed an Australian rock, R&B; and pop music band, the Cockroaches, alongside Paul on co-lead vocals, Anthony on co-lead vocals and guitar, Jeff Fatt on keyboards, Tony Henry on drums and Phil Robinson on bass guitar.McFarlane, 'The Cockroaches' entry.

There are still relatively few ensembles with similar specialization in the Czech Republic. Collegium 419 therefore aims for studying and staging ensemble and choral works, which are well-known and often shown in Europe but which still remain undiscovered or rare in Bohemia. The ensemble puts high demands on the vocal culture of its own members; most singers study privately solo singing and have wide experience with ensemble or solo singing. Shared interest in old music and refined aesthetical taste are the main motivations for their collaboration in Collegium 419. When interpreting works with orchestral accompaniment, Collegium 419 works with outstanding instrumental ensembles that follow historical performance praxis of early music, e.g. Hipocondria Ensemble, La Gambetta, Ritornello and others. The ensemble was founded by Marika Pečená in 1999 with the main aim of discovering German Baroque Protestant music (Schein, Schutz, Buxtehude, Bach…). In 2004, Čeněk Svoboda started working with the ensemble and broadened the range of the repertoire with music of European high Renaissance (Victoria, Palestrina, Tallis, Lassus, Gallus…) and Italian Baroque music (Monteverdi, Lotti, Caldara, Astorga…). In autumn 2007 he took the role of artistic leader of the whole ensemble. Collegium 419 pays special attention to preparation of coherent dramaturgy, takes into consideration liturgical and thematic affinity of its programmes and tries to perform according to period praxis.

The company was best known as a video game publisher, originally under the name Program Power. It also sold many types of computer hardware and software (both its own and third-party) through its Leeds 'showroom' or via mail order.  Games  From 1980 to 1987 the company published a number of video games and other software for various home computers. The earliest programs were released for the Acorn Atom but Micro Power is best remembered for its games for that machine's successor, Acorn's BBC Micro (with all but two of its post-Atom games running on that machine). A large selection of games that could be (and weren't considered 'too old') were ported to the Acorn Electron after its release in 1983 and most new games were now released for these 2 machines in 1984. A few were also ported to other 8-bit platforms including Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum but these never achieved the success of the Acorn originals. Most of these were basic single screen games, typically arcade clones (see the list of notable games below). While mostly well received and popular at the time (especially on the Acorn platforms), by the mid 1980s, video games were becoming increasingly complex. While simple early arcade-style games still sold well, it was usually at a budget price. Micro Power themselves released Micro Power Magic compilations in 1986, each featuring ten of their games that had previously sold at up to £7.95 each (some only two years earlier), for £7.95. From 1985 onwards, Micro Power began to produce a few advanced games as opposed to a high quantity of simpler games. The first of these was the arcade adventure Castle Quest (BBC only) by Tony Sothcott, billed as \\"Probably the most challenging game ever devised for the BBC Micro\\". It was never converted for the Electron, because it used near full-screen scrolling in an 8-colour mode which was not possible on the more limited machine. This game was successful and a sequel was started which became Doctor Who and the Mines of Terror (BBC, C64, CPC), a huge arcade adventure that required its own ROM chip to run on the BBC Micro. Another later release was puzzle/platform game Imogen (BBC only, later ported to Electron by Superior Software and more recently remade for PC ) by Michael St. Aubyn which was noted for its witty, original puzzles and cute high-resolution monochrome graphics. These games took more money and time to produce and with significantly fewer releases per year, contributed to the downfall of the company. The Doctor Who game in particular is often cited as crippling the company with a number of problems such as the added cost of producing the ROM chips for the BBC version and the unreleased (but heavily previewed and advertised) ZX Spectrum version which would have required an add-on cartridge. There were also two 32-bit games, Chess 3D and Zelanites the Onslaught (a Space Invaders clone) for the Acorn Archimedes, released under the Micro Power name in 1991. It is unknown how these releases relate to the original company as there hadn't been a Micro Power release for four years. Notable earlier games include: Electron version of Cybertron Mission *Adventure - a text adventure (Atom, BBC, Electron) *Alien Destroyers - a Space Invaders clone (BBC only) *Bandits at 3 O'Clock - a 2-player World War II dogfight (BBC, Electron) *Block Buster - a Q*bert clone (BBC only) *Bumble Bee - a Lady Bug clone (BBC, Electron, C64) *Cabman - an overhead view taxi driving game (Spectrum only) *Cowboy Shootout - a Boot Hill clone (Atom, BBC, Spectrum) *Croaker - a Frogger clone (BBC, Electron) *Cybertron Mission - a Berzerk clone (BBC, Electron, C64) *Danger UXB - a Check Man clone (BBC, Electron) *Dune Rider - a Moon Patrol clone (BBC only) *Electron Invaders - a Space Invaders clone (Electron only) *Escape from Moonbase Alpha - a graphic adventure (BBC, Electron) *Felix and the Fruit Monsters - a Pac-Man style overhead maze game (BBC, Electron) *Felix in the Factory - a platform game (BBC, Electron, C64, Memotech MTX) *Felix Meets the Evil Weevils - a platform game (BBC, Electron) *Frenzy - a Qix clone (BBC, Electron, C64) *Galactic Commander - a Lunar Lander clone (BBC, Electron) *Gauntlet - a Defender clone (BBC, Electron, CPC) *Ghouls - a platform game with Pac-Man-like characters (BBC, Electron, C64, CPC) *Hell Driver - an overhead view driving game (BBC only) *Intergalactic Trader - a text-based space trading game (BBC, Electron) *Invasion Force - a Space Invaders clone (Atom only) *Jet Power Jack - a platform game (BBC, Electron, C64) *Killer Gorilla - a Donkey Kong clone (BBC, Electron, CPC) *Laser Command - a Missile Command clone (BBC only) *The Mine - a Dig Dug clone (BBC, Electron) *Mr. Ee! - a Mr. Do! clone (BBC only) *Moon Raider - a Scramble clone (BBC, Electron) *Nemesis - a Centipede clone (BBC only) *Plutonium Plunder - a Pengo-style overhead maze game (BBC only) *Positron - a fast-paced Space Invaders style shoot 'em up (BBC, Electron) *Rubble Trouble - a Pengo-style overhead maze game (BBC, Electron) *Starfleet Encounter - a text-based strategy game for 2-8 players (BBC only) *Stock Car - an overhead view racing game (BBC, Electron, C64) *Swag - a 2-player arcade game involving bank robbery (BBC, Electron) *Swoop - a Galaxian clone (BBC, Electron, C64) *Zarm - a Lunar Rescue clone (BBC only)  Educational / Utility Software  As well as games, Micro Power released a number of educational programs (covering subjects such as science and geography) as well as utility software such as the Draw art package (BBC, Electron), Basic Extensions and Constellation astronomy program (Atom, BBC, later ported to Electron by Superior Software).  Hardware  Micro Power also released hardware such as the 'Micro Power Add-On' for the ZX Spectrum which added 2 joystick ports and 3-channel sound capability.  Leeds Store  Micro Power had a store on the corner of North Street and Meanwood Road in Leeds. They primarily sold Acorn hardware and software. Also they sold software for other computers including C64, ZX Spectrum, and QL. In the 1990s Micro Power downsized and moved further up Meanwood Road to reduce outgoings. There is still the original Micro Power sign at the back of their first premises.

The station is managed by Greater Anglia, which also operates most of the services calling at the station. Some East Midlands Railway also stop at Harling Road. History The Bill for the Norwich & Brandon Railway (N&BR;) received Royal Assent on 10 May 1844. Work started on the line in 1844 and the line and its stations were opened on 30 July 1845. . The line ran from Ely to Trowse, in Norwich. The link into Norwich was delayed due to the need to build a bridge over the River Wensum that kept the river navigable. One month before the N&BR; opened a Bill authorising the amalgamation of the Yarmouth & Norwich Railway with the N&BR; came into effect and so Harling station became a Norfolk Railway asset.C.J. Allen Description The station is situated approximately north-west of East Harling, the village from which it takes its name. A footpath links the station to the village. Harling Road is a small station and until recently had remained largely outdated. The wooden level crossing gates adjacent to the station used to be opened and closed manually by a signaller in the Harling Road signal box. In December 2012 the signal box was closed and the crossing was renewed with automatic barriers with warning lights. Passenger facilities are basic, with a car-park and seating in a shelter on the eastbound (Norwich) platform only. There is a bicycle shelter on the westbound (Cambridge) platform. There is no ticket office, and tickets may be bought from the conductor on the train. Harling Road is located in a rural area, and is ideally placed to provide access to the countryside for those who can not, or do not wish to, make use of a car for transportation. There is easy access to several long-distance footpaths, including the Peddars Way, Angles Way, Icknield Way, Iceni Way and the Hereward Way. There are a number of other opportunities with Knettishall Heath, West Harling Heath and Wayland Wood (where the events that inspired the Babes in the Wood took place) all being within walking distance. Services , from Monday to Saturday there are two trains per day eastbound to , both timed to arrive in Norwich before 09:00 and operated by Greater Anglia. Westbound, there are two trains per day on weekday afternoons, one operated by East Midlands Railway which calls at and before reversing and continuing to ; and the other to , operated by Greater Anglia.

Also known as the Mechanical Traveller, it had a pair of mechanical legs, with feet that gripped the rails at the rear of the engine to push it forwards at about three miles an hour. Design The collieries were well served between towns by the canal system. From the pit head to the canals, horse-drawn wagonways had been constructed and steam engines were seen as no more than a noisy and dangerous novelty. However the Napoleonic Wars from 1799 to 1815 had brought a great increase in the price of fodder. Moreover, some such \\"railways\\" were being constructed on the steeper gradients within canals, as for instance on the Charnwood Forest Canal. Nobody believed that steel wheels on smooth steel rails would give enough adhesion until Robert Stephenson and William Hedley proved otherwise in 1813 and even the former considered 1 in 100 (1%) was the absolute maximum grade. Consequently such steam operated systems as there were, were operated by cumbersome cables, or by the use of an expensive rack and pinion. Crich This makes Brunton's idea seem more reasonable, given that the Butterley Company were faced with a gradient of 1 in 50 between its Limestone quarry at Crich to the Cromford Canal at Amber Wharf, some away. Brunton took out a patent, No. 3700, dated 22 May 1813 for the locomotive. The Butterley locomotive cost a total of £240. Newbottle The historical record is scanty but it seems that the Steam Horse operated successfully for an unknown period. So much so, that another, larger, one with a 9 ft boiler rather than the original 5 ft, seems to have been built for the Newbottle Colliery, in County Durham. This locomotive cost £540 and may have had two cylinders. During 1814 and 1815 it hauled loads up a 1 in 36 gradient at , but the colliery owners were not happy with it. On 31 July 1815, during a demonstration, the new wrought iron boiler exploded, killing thirteen spectators and injuring several others. The reason was that the safety valves had been screwed down too tightly and were therefore not working. The idea was not pursued afterwards. This incident was the first recorded railway disaster.

A person may be an Irish citizenIn Irish law the terms \\"nationality\\" and \\"citizenship\\" have equivalent meanings. through birth, descent, marriage to an Irish citizen or through naturalisation. The law grants citizenship to individuals born in Northern Ireland under the same conditions as those born in the Republic of Ireland. HistoryIrish Free State Constitution (1922)= Irish Free State passport cover as issued 1927 (holder's name removed) 'Request' page of the Irish Free State passport as issued in 1927 Irish citizenship law originates with Article 3 of the Constitution of the Irish Free State which came into force on 6 December 1922; it applied domestically only until the enactment of the Constitution (Amendment No. 26) Act 1935 on 5 April 1935.According to Article 3 of the Free State Constitution Irish citizenship had previously only \\"within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann)\\". The Twenty Sixth amendment deleted the condition to extend the duties and right of Irish citizenship outside of the Free State.Dáil Debates, 14 February 1935, Vol. 54 No. 12 Col. 2049, Constitution (Amendment No. 26) Bill, 1934, Second Stage, The President. Any person domiciled in the island of Ireland on 6 December 1922 was an Irish citizen if: * he or she was born in the island of Ireland; * at least one of his or her parents was born in the island of Ireland; or * he or she had been ordinarily resident in the island of Ireland for at least seven years; except that \\"any such person being a citizen of another State\\" could \\"[choose] not to accept\\" Irish citizenship. (The Article also stated that \\"the conditions governing the future acquisition and termination of citizenship in the Irish Free State […] shall be determined by law\\".) While the Constitution referred to those domiciled \\"in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State\\", this was interpreted as meaning the entire island. This was because under the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, Northern Ireland had the right to opt out of the Irish Free State within one month of the Irish Free State coming into existence.‘Irish Nationality and Citizenship since 1922’ by Mary E. Daly, in ‘Irish Historical Studies’ Vol. 32, No. 127, May, 2001 (pp. 377-407) On 7 December 1922, the day after the Irish Free State was created, Northern Ireland exercised this option. However the ‘twenty-four-hour gap’ meant that every person who was ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland on 6 December 1922 was deemed to be an Irish citizen under Article 3 of the Constitution.In re Logue [1933] 67 ILTR 253. The decision resulted in changes being made the British Nationality Act 1948 by section 5 the Ireland Act 1949, to ensure that people who were domiciled in Northern Ireland on 6 December 1922 but were born elsewhere in Ireland would not fail to become a \\"citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies\\" merely because they were also an Irish citizen. The status of the Irish Free State as a Dominion within the British Commonwealth was seen by the British authorities as meaning that a \\"citizen of the Irish Free State\\" was merely a member of the wider category of \\"British subject\\"; this interpretation could be supported by the wording of Article 3 of the Constitution, which stated that the privileges and obligations of Irish citizenship applied \\"within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State\\". However, the Irish authorities repeatedly rejected the idea that its citizens had the additional status of \\"British subject\\".Brian Ó Caoindealbháin (2006) Citizenship and Borders: Irish Nationality Law and Northern Ireland.

There is not, in fact, > 'common citizenship' throughout the British Commonwealth: the Indian > 'citizen' is treated by the Australian 'citizen' as an undesirable alien. Irish passports were issued from 1923, and to the general public from 1924, but the British government objected to them, and their wording for many years. Using an Irish Free State passport abroad, if consular assistance from a British Embassy was required, could lead to administrative difficulties. =Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1935= The 1922 Constitution provided for citizenship for only those alive on 6 December 1922. No provision was made for those born after this date. As such it was a temporary provision which required the enactment of a fully-fledged citizenship law which was done by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1935. This Act provided for, among other things: * Irish citizenship by birth for anyone born within the Irish Free State on or after 6 December 1922; * Irish citizenship by descent for anyone born outside the Irish Free State on or after 6 December 1922, and before the passing of the 1935 Act (10 April 1935) and whose father was, on the day of such person's birth, an Irish citizen; * Irish citizenship by descent for anyone born outside the Irish Free State on or after the passing of the 1935 Act (10 April 1935) and whose father was an Irish citizen at the time of his or her birth. If the father had been born outside the Irish Free State, such birth had to be registered in register of Northern-Ireland- or foreign births. \\"A registration requirement was imposed for those born on or after the passing of the Act (10 April 1935) outside the Irish Free State of a father himself born outside the Irish Free State (including in Northern Ireland) or a naturalised citizen.\\"; * a naturalisation procedure; and * automatic denaturalisation for anyone who became a citizen of another country on or after reaching 21 years of age. The provision of citizenship by descent had the effect, given the interpretation noted above, of providing citizenship for those in Northern Ireland born after 6 December 1922 so long as their father had been resident anywhere in Ireland on said date. However, this automatic entitlement was limited to the first generation, with the citizenship of subsequent generations requiring registration and the surrendering of any other citizenship held at the age of 21. The combination of the principles of birth and descent in the Act respected the state's territorial boundary, with residents of Northern Ireland treated \\"in an identical manner to persons of Irish birth or descent who resided in Britain or a foreign country\\".Daly, Mary (2001) \\"Irish nationality and citizenship since 1922\\", Irish historical studies 32 (127): 377-407. Cited in Ó Caoindealbháin (2006) According to Brian Ó Caoindealbháin, the 1935 Act was, therefore, compatible with the state's existing borders, respecting and, in effect, reinforcing them.Ó Caoindealbháin (2006), p.12 The Act also provided for the establishment of the Foreign Births Register. Further, the 1935 Act was an attempt to assert the sovereignty of the Free State and the distinct nature of Irish citizenship, and to end the ambiguity over the relations between Irish citizenship and British subject status. Nonetheless, London continued to recognise Irish citizens as British subjects until the passing of the Ireland Act 1949, which recognised, as a distinct class of persons, \\"citizens of the Republic of Ireland\\".Síofra O'Leary (1996) Irish nationality law, in B Nascimbene (ed.), Nationality laws in the European Union, Milan: Butterworths, cited in Ó Caoindealbháin (2006) Beginning in 1923, some new economic rights were created for Irish citizens. The 1923 Land Act allowed the Irish Land Commission to refuse to allow a purchase of farmland by a non-Irish citizen; during the Anglo-Irish trade war the Control of Manufactures Act 1932 required that at least 50% of the ownership of Irish-registered companies had to be held by Irish citizens. “The 1932 act defined an Irish ‘national’ as a person who had been born within the boundaries of the Irish Free State or had resided in the state for five years before 1932 ... Under the terms of the Control of Manufactures Acts, all residents of Northern Ireland were deemed to be foreigners; indeed, the legislation may have been explicitly designed with this in mind.”Daly, Mary (2001) \\"Irish nationality and citizenship since 1922\\", Irish historical studies 32 (127):393 =Constitution of Ireland (1937)= The 1937 Constitution of Ireland simply maintained the previous citizenship body, also providing, as the previous constitution had done, that the further acquisition and loss of Irish citizenship was to be regulated by law. With regard to Northern Ireland, despite the irredentist nature and rhetorical claims of articles 2 and 3 of the new constitution, the compatibility of Irish citizenship law with the state's boundaries remained unaltered.Ó Caoindealbháin (2006) =Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956= In 1956, the Irish parliament enacted the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956. This Act repealed the 1935 Act and remains, although heavily amended, the basis of Irish citizenship law. This act, according to Ó Caoindealbháin, altered radically the treatment of Northern Ireland residents in Irish citizenship law. With the enactment of the Republic of Ireland Act in 1948, and the subsequent passage of the Ireland Act by the British government in 1949, the state's constitutional independence was assured, facilitating the resolution of the unsatisfactory position from an Irish nationalist perspective whereby births in Northern Ireland were assimilated to \\"foreign\\" births. The Irish government was explicit in its aim to amend this situation, seeking to extend citizenship as widely as possible to Northern Ireland, as well as to Irish emigrants and their descendants abroad.Brian Ó Caoindealbháin (2006) Citizenship and Borders: Irish Nationality Law and Northern Ireland. Centre for International Borders Research, Queen's University of Belfast and Institute for British-Irish Studies, University College Dublin The Act therefore provided for Irish citizenship for anyone born in the island of Ireland whether before or after independence. The only limitations to this provision were that anyone born in Northern Ireland was not automatically an Irish citizen but entitled to be an Irish citizen and, that a child of someone entitled to diplomatic immunity in the state would not become an Irish citizen. The Act also provided for open-ended citizenship by descent and for citizenship by registration for the wives (but not husbands) of Irish citizens. The treatment of Northern Ireland residents in these sections had considerable significance for the state's territorial boundaries, given that their \\"sensational effect … was to confer, in the eyes of Irish law, citizenship on the vast majority of the Northern Ireland population\\".Kelly, JM (1994) The Irish constitution, 3rd ed. Dublin: Butterworths, cited in Ó Caoindealbháin (2006) The compatibility of this innovation with international law, according to Ó Caoindealbháin was dubious, \\"given its attempt to regulate the citizenship of an external territory … In seeking to extend citizenship beyond the state’s jurisdiction, the 1956 Act openly sought to subvert the territorial boundary between North and South\\". The implications of the Act were readily recognised in Northern Ireland, with Lord Brookeborough tabling a motion in the Parliament of Northern Ireland repudiating “the gratuitous attempt … to inflict unwanted Irish Republican nationality upon the people of Northern Ireland”.Daly, Mary (2001) “Irish nationality and citizenship since 1922”, Irish historical studies 32 (127): 377-407. Cited in Ó Caoindealbháin (2006) Nevertheless, Irish citizenship continued to be extended to the inhabitants of Northern Ireland for over 40 years, representing, according to Ó Caoindealbháin, \\"one of the few practical expressions of the Irish state’s irredentism.\\" Ó Caoindealbháin concludes, however, that the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 altered significantly the territorial implications of Irish citizenship law, if somewhat ambiguously, via two key provisions: the renunciation of the constitutional territorial claim over Northern Ireland, and the recognition of \\"the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British or both, as they may so choose\\", and that \\"their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments\\". In regard to international law, Ó Caoindealbháin states that, although it is the attempt to confer citizenship extra-territorially without the agreement of the state affected that represents a breach of international law (not the actual extension), the 1956 Act \\"co-exists uneasily with the terms of the Agreement, and, by extension, the official acceptance by the Irish state of the current border. While the Agreement recognises that Irish citizenship is the birthright of those born in Northern Ireland, it makes clear that its acceptance is a matter of individual choice. In contrast, the 1956 Act continues to extend citizenship automatically in the majority of cases, thereby, in legal effect, conflicting with the agreed status of the border and the principle of consent\\". =Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1986 and 1994= In 1986, the 1956 Act was amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1986. This Act was primarily concerned with removing various gender discriminatory provisions from the 1956 legislation and thus provided for citizenship by registration for the wives and husbands of Irish citizens. The Act also restricted the open-ended citizenship by descent granted by the 1956 Act by dating the citizenship of third, fourth and subsequent generations of Irish emigrants born abroad, from registration and not from birth. This limited the rights of fourth and subsequent generations to citizenship to those whose parents had been registered before their birth. The Act provided for a six-month transitional period during which the old rules would still apply. Such was the increase in volume of applications for registration from third, fourth and further generation Irish emigrants, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1994 was enacted to deal with those individuals who applied for registration within the six-month period but who could not be registered in time. = and the Constitution= Up until the late 1990s, , in the Republic, was maintained as a matter of statute law, the only people being constitutionally entitled to citizenship of the Irish state post-1937 were those who had been citizens of the Irish Free State before its dissolution. However, as part of the new constitutional settlement brought about by the Good Friday Agreement, the new Article 2 introduced in 1999 by the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland provided (among other things) that: The introduction of this guarantee resulted in the enshrinement of as a constitutional right for the first time.This is clearly the view of Denham, McGuinness and Hardiman JJ, in Osayande v. Minister for Justice, a view which is supported by the current writers of Kelly. In contrast the only people entitled to British citizenship as a result of the Belfast Agreement are people born in Northern Ireland to Irish citizens, British citizens and permanent residents. If immigration was not on the political agenda in 1998, it did not take long to become so afterwards. Indeed, soon after the agreement, the already rising strength of the Irish economy reversed the historic pattern of emigration to one of immigration, a reversal which in turn resulted in a large number of foreign nationals claiming a right to remain in the state based on their Irish-born citizen children.The Irish Department of Justice granted leave to remain in the state to around 10,500 non-nationals between 1996 and February 2003 on the basis of their having an Irish born child – Department of Justice Press Release . They did so on the basis of a 1989 Supreme Court judgment in Fajujonu v. Minister for Justice where the court prohibited the deportation of the foreign parents of an Irish citizen. In January 2003, the Supreme Court distinguished the earlier decision and ruled that it was constitutional for the Government to deport the parents of children who were Irish citizens.Osayande v. Minister for Justice This latter decision would have been thought to put the matter to rest but concerns remained about the propriety of the (albeit indirect) deportation of Irish citizens and what was perceived as the overly generous provisions of Irish nationality law. In March 2004, the government introduced the draft Bill for the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland to remedy what the Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell, described as an \\"abuse of citizenship\\" whereby citizenship was \\"conferred on persons with no tangible link to the nation or the State whether of parentage, upbringing or of long-term residence in the State\\".Quoted from the Daíl debate. The Amendment did not propose to change the wording of Articles 2 and 3 as introduced by the Nineteenth Amendment, but instead to insert a clause clawing back the power to determine the future acquisition and loss of Irish citizenship by statute, as previously exercised by parliament before the Nineteenth amendment. The government also cited concerns about the Chen case, then before the European Court of Justice, in which a Chinese woman who had been living in Wales had gone to give birth in Northern Ireland on legal advice. Mrs. Chen then pursued a case against the British Home Secretary to prevent her deportation from the United Kingdom on the basis of her child's right as a citizen of the European Union (derived from the child's Irish citizenship) to reside in a member state of the Union. (Ultimately Mrs. Chen won her case, but this was not clear until after the result of the referendum.) Both the proposed amendment and the timing of the referendum were contentious but the result was decisively in favour of the proposal; 79% of those voting voted yes, on a turnout of 59%.See: Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland The effect of the amendment was to prospectively restrict the constitutional right to citizenship by birth to those who are born on the island of Ireland to at least one parent who is (or is someone entitled to be) an Irish citizen. Those born on the island of Ireland before the coming into force of the amendment continue to have a constitutional right to citizenship. Moreover, primarily existed in legislation and it remained, after the referendum, for parliament to pass ordinary legislation that would modify it. This was done by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004 (the effects of which are detailed above). It remains, however, a matter for the legislature and unrestricted could be re-established by ordinary legislation without a referendum. Acquisition of citizenshipAt birth= A person born on the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005:This dates relates to the commencement date of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004 and not the Twenty-seventh Amendment as is sometimes thought. * is automatically an Irish citizen if he or she is not entitled to the citizenship of any other country;Section 6(3) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004. or * is entitled to be an Irish citizen if at least one of his or her parents is: **an Irish citizen (or someone entitled to be an Irish citizen);Sections 6(1), 6A(2)(b) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004. **a British citizen;Sections 6(1) and 6A(2)(c) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004. **a resident of the island of Ireland who is entitled to reside in either the Republic or in Northern Ireland without any time limit on that residence;Sections 6(1), 6A(2)(c) and (d) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004. or **a legal resident of the island of Ireland for three out of the 4 years preceding the child's birth (although time spent as a student or as an asylum seeker does not count for this purpose).Sections 6(1), 6A(1) and 6B of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004. A person who is entitled to become an Irish citizen becomes an Irish citizen if: * he or she does any act that only Irish citizens are entitled to do; or * any act that only Irish citizens are entitled to do is done on his or her behalf by a person entitled to do so.Section 6(2) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004. Dual citizenship is permitted under Irish nationality law. December 1999 to 2005 Ireland previously had a much less diluted application of (the right to citizenship of the country of birth) which still applies to anyone born on or before 31 December 2004. Although passed in 2001, the applicable law was deemed enacted on 2 December 1999The relevant sections of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001 that was signed by the President on 5 June 2001, were backdated to apply from the changes made to Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution under the Good Friday Agreement: Minister for Justice, John O'Donoghue, Seanad Debates volume 161 column 982 (8 December 1999) . and provided that anyone born on the island of Ireland is: *entitled to be an Irish citizen and *automatically an Irish citizen if he or she was not entitled to the citizenship of any other country. Prior to 1999 The previous legislation was largely replaced by the 1999 changes, which were retroactive in effect. Before 2 December 1999, the distinction between Irish citizenship and entitlement to Irish citizenship rested on the place of birth. Under this regime, any person born on the island of Ireland was: * automatically an Irish citizen if born: ** on the island of Ireland before 6 December 1922, ** in the territory which currently comprises the Republic of Ireland, or ** in Northern Ireland on or after 6 December 1922 with a parent who was an Irish citizen at the time of birth; * entitled to be an Irish citizen if born in Northern Ireland and not automatically an Irish citizen.Sections 6(1) and 7(1) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as enacted. The provisions of the 1956 Act were, in terms of citizenship by birth, retroactive and replaced the provisions of the previous legislation, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1935. Under that legislation, those born in Northern Ireland on or after 6 December 1922 did not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship by birth. Citizenship of the Irish Free State was determined under the 1922 constitution, as amended by the Constitution (Amendment No. 26) Act 1935. Children of diplomats Like most countries, Ireland does not normally grant citizenship to the children of diplomats. This does not apply, however, when a diplomat parents a child with an Irish citizen, a British citizen or a permanent resident.Section 6(6) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004. In 2001, Ireland enacted a measure which allowed the children of diplomats to register as Irish citizens if they chose to do so; however, this was repealed three years later.Section 6(4) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004, as inserted by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001 and later repealed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004 The option to register remains for those born to diplomats before 2005. =By descent= A person is an Irish citizen by descent if, at the time of his or her birth, at least one of his or her parents was an Irish citizen. The place of that person's birth is not a deciding factor.Section 7(1) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004. In cases where at least one parent was an Irish citizen born in the island of Ireland or an Irish citizen not born on the island of Ireland but resident abroad in the public service,Section 7(3)(b) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004. citizenship is automatic and dates from birth. In all other cases citizenship is subject to registration in the Foreign Births Register.Section 7(3) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004. Due to legislative changes introduced in 1986, the Irish citizenship, of those individuals requiring registration, dates from registration and not from birth, for citizenship registered on or after 1 January 1987.While the 1986 act, which brought in the registration requirement, came into force on 1 July 1986, section 8 of the Act allowed for a six-month transitional period when people could still register under the old provisions. See: Minister for Justice, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, Dáil debates volume 140 column 131 (21 April 1994); Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Liz McManus, Seanad Debates volume 142 column 1730 (4 April 1995). Citizenship by registration had previously been back-dated to birth. Anyone with an Irish citizen grandparent born on the island of Ireland is eligible for Irish citizenship. His or her parent would have automatically been an Irish citizen and their own citizenship can be secured by registering themselves in the Foreign Births Register. In contrast, those wishing to claim citizenship through an Irish citizen great-grandparent would be unable to do so unless their parents were placed into the Foreign Births Register. Their parents can transmit Irish citizenship to only those children born after they themselves were registered and not to any children born before registration. Citizenship acquired through descent may be maintained indefinitely so long as each generation ensures its registration before the birth of the next. =By adoption= All adoptions performed or recognised under Irish law confer Irish citizenship on the adopted child (if not already an Irish citizen) if at least one of the adopters was an Irish citizen at the time of the adoption.Section 11 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended by section 175 of the Adoption Act 2010. =By marriage= From 30 November 2005 (three years after the 2001 Citizenship Act came into force),Section 4 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001 came into force on 30 November 2002 by ministerial order: Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001 (Commencement) Order, 2002. citizenship of the spouse of an Irish citizen must be acquired through the normal naturalisation process.The previous provisions having been repealed by section 4 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001. The residence requirement is reduced from 5 to 3 years in this case, and the spouse must intend to continue to reside in the island of Ireland.Sections 15A(1)(e) and (f) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as inserted by the section 33 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011. Previously, the law allowed for the spouses of most Irish citizens to acquire citizenship post-nuptially by registration without residence in the island of Ireland, or by naturalisation.Section 8 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 and section 3 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1986. * From 17 July 1956 to 31 December 1986,The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1986 came into force on 1 July 1986, section 8 of the Act allowed for a six-month transitional period during which both the new and old provisions were in force. the wife (but not the husband) of an Irish citizen (other than by naturalisation) could apply for post-nuptial citizenship. A woman who applied for this before marriage would become an Irish citizen upon marriage. This was a retrospective provision which could be applied to marriages made before 1956. However the citizenship granted was prospective only.Section 8 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as enacted. * Between 1 July 1986 and 29 November 2005, the spouse of an Irish citizen (other than by naturalisation, honorary citizenship or a previous marriage) could obtain post-nuptial citizenship after 3 years of subsisting marriage, provided the Irish spouse had held that status for at least 3 years. Like the provisions it replaced, the application of this regime was also retrospective.Section 3 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1986. =By naturalisation= The naturalisation of a foreigner as an Irish citizen is a discretionary power held by the Irish Minister for Justice. Naturalisation is granted on a number of criteria including good character, residence in the state and intention to continue residing in the state. In principle the residence requirement is three years if married to an Irish citizen, and five years otherwise. Time spent seeking asylum will not be counted. Nor will time spent as an illegal immigrant. Time spent studying in the state by a national of a non-EEA state (i.e. a state other than European Union Member States, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein) will not count. The Minister for Justice may waive the residency requirement for: * the children of naturalised citizens; * recognised refugees; * stateless children; * those resident abroad in the service of the Irish state; and * people of \\"Irish descent or Irish associations\\". =By grant of honorary citizenship= Section 12 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 allows the President, on advice of the Government, to \\"… grant Irish citizenship as a token of honour to a person, or the child or grandchild of a person who, in the opinion of the Government, has done signal honour or rendered distinguished service to the nation.\\"Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 Section 12 Although known as \\"honorary Irish citizenship\\", this is in fact legally a full form of citizenship, with entitlement to an Irish passport and the other rights of Irish citizenship on the same basis as a naturalised Irish citizen. This has been awarded only a few times. The first twelve people to have had honorary Irish citizenship conferred on them are: * Alfred Chester Beatty (1957) – art collector, philanthropist and founder of the Chester Beatty Library * Tiede Herrema (1975) (and his wife, Elizabeth Herrema) – Dutch businessman kidnapped by the Provisional IRA * Tip O'Neill (1986) (and his wife, Mildred Anne Miller O'Neill) – Irish-American and Speaker of the United States House of Representatives * Alfred Beit (1993) (and his wife Clementine Mabell Kitty Beit, née Freeman-Mitford) – art collector and owner of Russborough House * Jack Charlton (1996) (and his wife Pat Charlton) – for his achievements as manager of the Republic of Ireland national football team * Jean Kennedy Smith (1998) – former United States Ambassador to Ireland * Derek Hill (1999) – artist who established the Tory Island school of painting * Don Keough (2007) - former president of Coca-Cola (Atlanta) Plans were made to grant honorary Irish citizenship to U.S. president John F. Kennedy during his visit to Ireland in 1963, but this was abandoned owing to legal difficulties in granting citizenship to a foreign head of state.Sniper threat sparked alert during 1963 Kennedy visit -- The Irish Times newspaper article, 29 December 2006. Loss of citizenshipBy renunciation= An Irish citizen may renounce his or her citizenship if he or she is: * eighteen years or older, * ordinarily resident abroad, and * is, or is about to become, a citizen of another country. Renunciation is done by lodging a declaration with the Minister for Justice. If the person is not already a citizen of another country it is only effective when he or she becomes such. Irish citizenship cannot be lost by the operation of the law of another country,Section 21 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004 but foreign law may require a person to renounce Irish citizenship before acquiring foreign nationality (see Multiple citizenship#Multiple citizenship avoided). An Irish citizen born on the island of Ireland who renounces Irish citizenship remains entitled to be an Irish citizen and may resume it upon declaration.Section 6(5) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004. While not positively stated in the Act, the possibility of renouncing Irish citizenship is provided to allow Irish citizens to be naturalised as citizens of foreign countries whose laws do not allow for multiple citizenship. The Minister of Justice may revoke the citizenship of a naturalised citizen if he or she voluntarily acquires the citizenship of another country (other than by marriage) after naturalisation but there is no provision requiring them to renounce any citizenship they previously held. Similarly, there is no provision of Irish law requiring citizens to renounce their Irish citizenship before becoming citizens of other countries. =By revocation of a certificate of naturalisation= A certificate of naturalisation may be revoked by the Minister for Justice. Once revoked the person to whom the certificate applies ceases to be an Irish citizen. Revocation is not automatic and is a discretionary power of the Minister. A certificate may be revoked if it was obtained by fraud or when the naturalised citizen to whom it applies: * resides outside the state (or outside the island of Ireland in respect to naturalised spouses of Irish citizens) for a period exceeding seven years, otherwise than in the public service, without registering annually his or her intention to retain Irish citizenship (this provision does not apply to those who were naturalised owing to their \\"Irish descent or Irish associations\\"); * voluntarily acquires the citizenship of another country (other than by marriage); or * \\"has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State\\".Section 19(1)(b) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 to 2004 A notice of the revocation of a certificate of naturalisation must be published in Iris Oifigiúil (the official gazette of the Republic), but in the years of 2002 to 2012 (inclusive) no certificates of naturalisation were revoked.See the Official journal's Website. The period reflects the length of the Gazette's availability online. Dual citizenship Ireland allows its citizens to hold foreign citizenship in addition to their Irish citizenship. Simultaneous lines of Irish and UK citizenship for descendants of pre-1922 Irish emigrants Some descendants of Irish persons who left Ireland before 1922 may have claims to both Irish and British citizenship. Under section 5 of the UK's Ireland Act 1949, a person who was born in the territory of the future Republic of Ireland as a British subject, but who did not receive Irish citizenship under that Act's interpretation of either the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State or the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1935 (because he or she was no longer domiciled in the Republic on the day that the Free State constitution came into force and was not permanently resident there on the day of the 1935 law's enactment and was not otherwise registered as an Irish citizen) was deemed by British law to be a Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies. As such, many of those individuals and some of the descendants in the Irish diaspora of an Irish person who left Ireland before 1922 (and who was also not resident in 1935) may be registrable for Irish citizenship while also having a claim to British citizenship, through any of: * birth to the first generation emigrant, * consular registration of later generation births by a married father who was considered a British citizen under British law, within one year of birth, prior to the British Nationality Act (BNA) 1981 taking effect, * registration, at any time in life, with Form UKF, of birth to an unwed father who was considered a British citizen under British law, or * registration, at any time in life, with Form UKM, of birth to a mother who was considered a British citizen under British law, between the BNA 1948 and the BNA 1981 effective dates, under the UK Supreme Court's 2018 Romein principle. In some cases, British citizenship may be available to these descendants in the Irish diaspora even when Irish citizenship registration is not, as in instances of failure of past generations to timely register in a local Irish consulate's Foreign Births Register before the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1986 and before births of later generations. Citizenship of the European Union Because Ireland forms part of the European Union, Irish citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Irish embassy, Irish citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.Article 20(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.Rights abroad: Right to consular protection: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). Antigua and Barbuda (UK), Barbados (UK), Belize (UK), Central African Republic (France), Comoros (France), Gambia (UK), Guyana (UK), Liberia (Germany), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (UK), San Marino (Italy), São Tomé and Príncipe (Portugal), Solomon Islands (UK), Timor-Leste (Portugal), Vanuatu (France) Irish citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty. Following the 2016 UK referendum on leaving the EU, which resulted in a vote to leave the European Union, there was a large increase in applications by British citizens for Irish passports, so that they can retain their rights as EU citizens after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. There were 25,207 applications for Irish passports from Britons in the 12 months before the referendum, and 64,400 in the 12 months after. Applications to other EU countries also increased by a large percentage, but were numerically much smaller. Travel freedom of Irish citizens Visa requirements for Irish citizens Visa requirements for Irish citizens are travel restrictions placed upon citizens of the Republic of Ireland by the authorities of other states. In 2018, Irish citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 185 countries and territories, jointly ranking the Irish passport 6th worldwide according to the Henley Passport Index.Ranks are assigned using dense ranking. A standard ranking places the Irish passport joint 16th. The Irish nationality is ranked ninth in Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well.

Written by Gerry Finley-Day, the first episode was drawn by Mike McMahon who designed the craft and the main characters. The main series artists were Cam Kennedy, Garry Leach and John Richardson. Dan Abnett has recently finished the series at Book 5 with the help of artist Anthony Williams who has been working with Abnett on this for quite a while. CharactersFirst Geek War= The original V.C.s were: * Jupe, the crew's sergeant and ship's captain. Genetically engineered for life on the moons of Jupiter, giving him a huge physical presence and above normal strength. During the fight on the Geeks' fake homeworld, he is blinded by the light from the binary stars above, and is taken off active duty. A hardened fighter, being blinded did little to dull his fighting edge and he was still capable of snapping a Geek's neck with his bare hands. * Hen-Sho, the ship's 'missile man'; a native of Mars, which has been colonised by the Chinese. Hen- Sho has a highly evolved code of honour. A skilled martial artist, excelling in the use of the las-lance. While on a mission to locate the Geek homeworld in a stolen Geek ship, he was mortally wounded by shrapnel from a shipboard explosion. He evacuated Smith and Loon to the two remaining lifepods and died when the ship was destroyed. * Ringer, the ship's pilot, born on an outpost orbiting Saturn. He takes an instant dislike to Smith and becomes his main adversary, attacking him multiple times and even attempting to kill him once. He was driven insane after a Geek torture session and remains unfit for duty until Smith rescues him on the flagship. An expert with the 'kill-disc', a Saturnian powered weapon capable of decapitating its target. He demonstrated this weapon's effectiveness on the Dishwasher, slicing his head off at short range. He took a las-beam meant for Smith and died seconds later. * Dwarf Star, a mutant and the ship's port gunner. His family was attacked by the Geeks while on a colony ship bound for Neptune. The ship was attacked by the Geeks and was forced to make a jump to hyperspace to escape; but the hyperspace jump affected the colonists. Though the ship reached Neptune, Dwarf Star and his identical twin brother Midge were born deformed, with \\"no hair, strange eyes and mis-shapen faces\\". In the course of the story Smith is forced to fire on Midge's ship which had been captured by Geeks, killing Midge and souring relations between himself and Dwarf Star. Dwarf Star was flushed into space when a barrage from a Geek ambush force cracked open his gun turret, sacrificing himself to seal the door and save the rest of the ship. * Loon, the ship's starboard gunner. Prior to joining the V.C.s, he spent six years performing garrison detail on the Moon for disorderly conduct, which left him mentally unstable. He had a tendency to giggle inanely; Loon was also prone to carrying a teddy bear (much to the annoyance of Dwarf Star) and occasionally covering himself in war paint and going on a murderous rampage. He is killed by a Geek fighter-craft on a moon above the Geek homeworld. * Crick. Killed in action before the first series started. They were joined by: * Steve Smith. The main protagonist of the series. An 'earthworm' (derogatory term used by colonists for all those born on Earth) who signed on as a new recruit. Assigned to replace the late Crick, much to the chagrin of his new crewmates. Being an 'earthworm', he is near-universally disliked by his new crewmates- especially Ringer, who has a hatred for worms and tries to provoke him at every turn. He finally starts to toughen up and gain respect when Earth is bombed by the Geeks, killing his family. During the assault on Geek space he retrained as a star-scout. He played a pivotal role in the first Geek War by destroying Geek High Command. General Moore promoted him to Second Lieutenant for his actions, and he rose to the rank of major between the first and second series. The effects of the first war gave him post-traumatic stress disorder and he was prone to hallucinations, haunted by visions of his dead comrades. By the beginning of the second series, his military career has finished and he works as a janitor, but when the second war starts he is quick to sign up again. * Brother, the ship's computer. He controlled the ship's other systems, and interacted with the crew via a 'mouthpiece': an anthropomorphic avatar that originally resembled a court jester, but an ion storm damaged his personality tapes, turning him into a hippie. Following a three-hour flirtation with pacifism, Smith and Loon were able to persuade him to resume normal service. His avatar was redesigned to suit his new personality, but his behaviour remained erratic and his dialogue peppered with underground jargon. His avatar was also capable of using weapons, as shown when he helps the crew fend off a horde of young Geeks armed with two pistols. He is presumably 'killed' when the original V.C. ship is destroyed above the Geek homeworld. ;Other major characters * The Dishwasher. Members of the Diplomatic Corps were all called 'dishwashers' and were universally despised by the star-troopers for their cowardly demeanor and futile attempts to reason with the Geeks. One unnamed member of this group took command of the Terran reprisal fleet sent to end the first Geek war. Sadistic, cowardly and arrogant, he quickly came to hate the V.C.s, and sought to kill them by sending them on a series of suicide missions that blinded Jupe; sent Ringer mad and claimed the lives of Dwarf Star, Hen-Sho and Loon. He aided the Geeks when they infiltrated his flagship, tried to kill Smith to cover his tracks, but was decapitated by Ringer's kill- disc. * General Moore, second-in-command of Task Force Titan. A cyborg and experienced field officer of the Global Combat Corps, respected by all the star troopers for his record and perseverance. Forced to play second fiddle to the 'Dishwasher', he nonetheless helps Smith and Jupe rescue the rookie soldiers on the Geeks' fake homeworld. Later assumed command of the task force and proved instrumental, along with Smith, in wiping out Geek High Command. =Second Geek War= When the team was reformed new members included: * Kali, the pilot from the Kuiper Belt. * Ryx, the gunnery sergeant who takes the main turret. He was born on one of the Neptune colonies. * Keege, the port gunner and one of the Geek sympathisers working with humans against the more militaristic members of their society. * Tommy Hoff, the new starboard gunnery recruit occupying a similar role to Smith when he first joined the V.C.s * Tycho, the new 'missile man' despite being a woman. Another new recruit from the lunar colonies but tougher (and madder) than Hoff Plot The strip is set in the year 2531. The Solar System is engaged in a war of survival against an alien species known as \\"Geeks\\". Steve Smith, a raw recruit, has just completed his training and signed on with the Global Combat Corps as a star- trooper, but is quickly thrown in at the deep end: he is assigned to the hard- bitten crew of a space patrol ship crewed by the \\"Vacuum Cleaners\\" or V.C.s for short; so called because of their penchant for clean kills, with little to no debris. The twist is that Smith is the only Earth-born crew member: the rest of the crew are all from colonies on the other planets of the solar system, often being physically adapted to alien environments, and having little love for 'Ma Earth'. A major theme of this series is the antagonism between the crew (often racially motivated), particularly towards the \\"earthworm\\" Smith; and Smith's struggle for acceptance by the crew. Like many war stories, there is a high mortality rate amongst the main characters. The V.C.s are regarded with contempt by the Earth-led high command, but are acknowledged as the best crew in the fleet. Eventually, the Diplomatic Corps (known as 'dishwashers') recalls most of the fleet back to the colonies in an effort to show the Geeks that they mean peace. However, the Geeks take this as an opportunity, and a Geek armada attacks every major colony in the system, including Mars and Earth. After this, a counterattack is launched against the Geek homeworld by the Dishwashers. Following a preliminary attack on what was thought to be the Geeks' home planet, the V.C.s disobey orders by going down to the planet to save a platoon of 'green' soldiers. The 'Dishwasher' in charge perceives this as a slight, and gives the V.C.s punishment by sending them on near-suicidal duties. Much in the style of The Dirty Dozen this results in a high fatality rate and over the course of the series all of the V.C.s save Smith and Jupe are killed off. Ultimately Smith, the sole member of the original V.C.s who remains fighting fit, leads a heroic attack on the Geek homeworld that ends the war. The VCs were revived in 2000 AD in 2002 and are still active. The new series is written by Dan Abnett and initially drawn by Henry Flint, later replaced by Anthony Williams. In the new stories Smith, now a major, is a veteran of the first Human-Geek war who leads a squad of raw recruits when a new war breaks out between the two races just as Earth is on the verge of joining the Polity, a galactic alliance of species. It was later revealed that \\"The Polity\\" was behind both wars. At the end of Book V, the Humans finally negotiated a deal with the Geeks. Alien races Human = Even though they are still considered a single species, the humans of the 26th century appear to be a race at the threshold of evolutionary divergence. They have spread to the rest of the solar system, colonising the many planets, moons and planetoids within the influence of their sun. A belligerent, persistent and aggressive species, they have risen to each challenge presented by their dozens of new homes, building stations, fortresses and cities wherever the space can be found, and even undergoing genetic treatment to better adapt to their worlds. A great deal of animosity that shares elements of both racism and national pride exists between the colonists and the humans that chose to remain on Earth. Smith, upon encountering the V.C.s, observed in his diary that his comrades were all 'half-castes', while his father, upon seeing Jupe on a vid-screen was surprised to see a 'real, live Jovian' and described him as an 'ugly-lookin' fish'. Conversely, the V.C.s, all colonists from different worlds, often used the term 'earthworm' to describe Smith and his compatriots. By the time of the second war, humanity had even colonised the Kuiper Belt, tightening their grasp over their solar system. = Geek = Also known as \\"G'egeekajee\\", they physiologically tend to be upright and humanoid in outline, but all resemblance to humans stops there. They are a polymorphic species of r-strategists (prolific reproducers). Geeks possess a strange blend of reptilian and insectoid characteristics, perfectly adapted to life on their jungle homeworld. During the first war, they often used guerrilla tactics and traps against the humans, rather than straightforward warfare. Whilst they can and do engage in battle, they are far more fond of weakening the enemy first and then going in for the kill afterwards. Examples of their tactics include: * Constructing hives inside asteroids; when activated with a special signal, thousands of Geek young are released to attack. This trap nearly overwhelmed the V.C.s until Smith figured out their control vector and got Brother to send a countersignal, disorienting them. * Capturing a ship and its crew and forcing the crew to lure others into a killzone; this was tried with Midge's ship, but he managed to get a coded message through to the V.C.s in time for them to react. * Using a lake on an otherwise desert planet as cover in order to ambush troops landing on the planet. Geeks have an emphasis on controlled breeding, which pervades their culture and tactics. Many Geeks are predestined for one role or another; the circumstances of their creation generating specific physical characteristics. They are several different kinds or castes of Geek: the most common serve as soldiers, appearing identical to human eyes but for a distinguishing pheromone. A Geek general is recognisable by its swollen cranium and facial tentacles, suggesting that it and others like it are bred for heightened intelligence and advanced tactical planning. Some Geeks are bred solely for the purpose of breeding; they are sent into ships as kamikaze troops, laying dozens of eggs at the moment of death in order to overwhelm the enemy with their young. The Geeks first became involved in human history when they waged war on humanity during the early 26th century. The resultant interstellar war affected every one of the burgeoning colony worlds in the Solar System held by the humans. Notable victories scored by the Geeks during this first space war included: * An attack resulting in the destruction of Phobos Harbour and the Martian colony cities, including New Peking City, built on the peak of Olympus Mons; an attack that wiped out a good portion of the human military. * Attacking the Jovian colony on Ganymede. * Destroying Transatlantic City (Smith's home city) on Earth. The Geeks use the inner phonemes as abbreviations so the name they call themselves, G'Egeekajee, becomes Geek and their name for humans, Kajeek'Gedek'Ka'Aak, becomes Eeek-Ek-Aak (this means \\"murderous pink-skins of Earth\\").Prog 1486 They are capable of speaking English, but this is only shown by leaders of the Geek military. = Other races = The Polity  A member of the Polity The Polity are an intergalactic superpower that have advanced technology such as the ability to freeze time. They start wars between other aliens for their own amusement. It is late revealed in \\"Mail Call\\" that they consider themselves to have evolved so much that they now believe that they are unable or unsuited to fight, they have to rely on mercenaries such as the Naxon to fight their wars. It is also revealed that any species within their empire are slave races. In the end, their spies informed them that the Humans were secretly negotiating with the Geek Apologist faction for a peace treaty. The Polity decided to sabotage the peace talks and enlisted the help of Naxon mercenaries to assassinate the Apologist leader.  Naxon  A Naxon A \\"race of exterminators\\" according to Keege, they act as mercenaries to the highest bidder exterminating entire species. They have highly advanced military technology that can destroy an Earth ship with their shield at 100%. Contacted by \\"The Polity\\" during an extermination of the natives of 41 Hydra to assassinate a Geek ambassador to Earth, they were unsuccessful in their mission after the entire group perished and their leader killed.

It commemorates Victory over Japan Day, when at the end of World War II, the U.S. and Soviet forces helped end 35 years of Japanese occupation and colonial rule of Korea that lasted from 1910-1945. It is notable for being the only Korean public holiday celebrated by both South and North. Etymology In South Korea it is known as Gwangbokjeol (광복절; literally, \\"the day the light returned\\"), and is one of the public holidays in South Korea. In North Korea it is known as Chogukhaebangŭi nal (조국해방의 날; literally Liberation of the Fatherland Day), and is also one of the public holidays in North Korea. History A Japanese flag at Seoul being lowered in 1945 as U.S. soldiers watch. After the Korean Peninsula was liberated by the Allies in 1945, independent Korean governments were created three years later, on 15 August 1948, when the pro-U.S. Syngman Rhee was elected first President of South Korea and pro-Soviet Kim Il-sung was made first Leader of North Korea. Gwangbokjeol was officially designated a public holiday on 1 October 1949 in South Korea Gwangbokjeol at Doosan Encyclopedia and is known as Chogukhaebangŭi nal (; literally \\"Liberation of Fatherland Day\\") in North Korea. Thinking of reunification through Gwangbokjeol, official blog of the Ministry of Unification North Korea Liberation day poster in Pyongyang, North Korea North Korea currently celebrates this holiday separately from South Korea.Defector from North Korea describes (in Japanese) differences in attitudes and emphasis. Nevertheless, Liberation Day is the only Korean holiday that is celebrated by both countries. In North Korea, it is typical to schedule weddings on the holiday.https://aglobalworld.com/holidays-around-the-world/north-korea- liberation-day/ On 5 August 2015, the North Korean government decided to return to UTC+08:30, effective 15 August 2015, and said the official name would be Pyongyang Time or (PYT). The government of North Korea made this decision as a break from 'imperialism'; the time zone change went into effect on the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Korea. The holiday is often celebrated with a military parade on Kim Il-sung Square on jubilee years (ex: 25th anniversary, 40th anniversary, 50th anniversary, 60th anniversary, 70th anniversary) with the attendance of the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of North Korea. The first parade was held in 1949 at Pyongyang Station. It was held again in 1953, and then conducted every year until 1960, when it took a pause until the early 2000s.https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-north-korea-military- parades-20180908-story.html?_amp=true South KoreaPublic holiday= In South Korea, many activities and events take place on the holiday, including an official ceremony attended by the President of the Republic either at the Independence Hall of Korea in Cheonan or at the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts.

Applications The quantum yield for the decomposition of a reactant molecule in a decomposition reaction is defined as: :: \\\\Phi = \\\\frac{\\\\rm \\\\\\\\#\\\\ molecules \\\\ decomposed} {\\\\rm \\\\\\\\#\\\\ photons \\\\ absorbed} Quantum yield can also be defined for other events, such as fluorescence:Lakowicz, Joseph R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy (Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishers 1999) p.10. :: \\\\Phi = \\\\frac {\\\\rm \\\\\\\\#\\\\ photons \\\\ emitted} {\\\\rm \\\\\\\\#\\\\ photons \\\\ absorbed} Here, quantum yield is the emission efficiency of a given fluorophore.  Examples  Quantum yield is used in modeling photosynthesis: :: \\\\Phi = \\\\frac {\\\\rm \\\\mu mol\\\\ CO_2 \\\\ fixed} {\\\\rm \\\\mu mol\\\\ photons \\\\ absorbed} In a chemical photodegradation process, when a molecule dissociates after absorbing a light quantum, the quantum yield is the number of destroyed molecules divided by the number of photons absorbed by the system. Since not all photons are absorbed productively, the typical quantum yield will be less than 1. Quantum yields greater than 1 are possible for photo-induced or radiation-induced chain reactions, in which a single photon may trigger a long chain of transformations. One example is the reaction of hydrogen with chlorine, in which as many as 106 molecules of hydrogen chloride can be formed per quantum of blue light absorbed.Laidler K.J., Chemical Kinetics (3rd ed., Harper & Row 1987) p.289 In optical spectroscopy, the quantum yield is the probability that a given quantum state is formed from the system initially prepared in some other quantum state. For example, a singlet to triplet transition quantum yield is the fraction of molecules that, after being photoexcited into a singlet state, cross over to the triplet state. The fluorescence quantum yield is defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons absorbed. Experimentally, relative fluorescence quantum yields can be determined by measuring fluorescence of a fluorophore of known quantum yield with the same experimental parameters (excitation wavelength, slit widths, photomultiplier voltage etc.) as the substance in question. The quantum yield is then calculated by: \\\\Phi = \\\\Phi_\\\\mathrm{R}\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\mathit{Int}}{\\\\mathit{Int}_\\\\mathrm{R}}\\\\frac{1-10^{-A_\\\\mathrm{R}}}{1-10^{-A}}\\\\frac{{n}^2}{{n_\\\\mathrm{R}}^2} where \\\\Phi is the quantum yield, Int is the area under the emission peak (on a wavelength scale), A is absorbance (also called \\"optical density\\") at the excitation wavelength, and n is the refractive index of the solvent.

Harpagus, also known as Harpagos or Hypargus (Ancient Greek Ἅρπαγος; Akkadian: Arbaku), was a Median general from the 6th century BC, credited by Herodotus as having put Cyrus the Great on the throne through his defection during the battle of Pasargadae. Biography Painting of king Astyages sending Harpagus to kill young Cyrus Harpagus bring infant Cyrus to the shepherd. Sebastiano Ricci (1659–1734) King Astyages places Harpagos in command of his army, by Jan Moy (1535-1550). According to Herodotus' Histories, Harpagus was a member of the Median royal house in service to King Astyages, the last king of Media. When word reached Astyages that Cyrus was gathering his forces, he ordered Harpagus, as his primary general, to lead the army against Cyrus. After a three-day battle on the plain of Pasargadae, Harpagus took his revenge for the death of his son when he turned on the battlefield in favor of Cyrus, resulting in Astyages' defeat and the formation of the Persian Empire. Myth Herodotus accounts for the turn of Harpagus' support to a version of the cannibal feast of Thyestes.The detailed parallels are presented by Walter Burkert, Homo Necans (1983:103-09. He reports that Astyages, after having a dream that his daughter, Mandane, would give birth to a king who would overthrow him, ordered Harpagus to expose the child at birth. Harpagus, reluctant to spill his own royal blood, gave the child (Cyrus) to a shepherd named Mitradates,Mitradeates: the Hellenistic form of an Iranian theophoric name meaning \\"given by Mithra\\". who raised him as his own son. Ten years later, when Cyrus was discovered alive, Astyages cruelly punished Harpagus by killing Harpagus' only son and feeding him to Harpagus during a banquet. It is said that Harpagus did not react during the banquet, other than to gather the pieces of his son and remove them for burial. Astyages then asked his Magi (priests) for their advice about the fate of Cyrus. They told him that the boy, who had been discovered while playing king of the mountain with his friends, had fulfilled the prophecy of becoming a king, albeit in play, and was no longer a danger. On their advice, Astyages sent Cyrus to his parents, Cambyses I and Mandane, in Anšan (southwestern Iran near Shiraz). Harpagus bided his time, sending gifts to Cyrus to keep contact with him, as he worked to turn the nobles of Media against Astyages. When they were ready, he sent a message to Cyrus, hidden in the belly of a hare, informing him that the Medians would mutiny on the field, should he take arms against his grandfather. Harpagus in historical texts Herodotus, The Histories: > \\"Astyages, as soon as Cyrus was born, sent for Harpagus, a man of his own > house and the most faithful of the Medes....\\" > \\"When Cyrus beheld the Lydians arranging themselves in order of battle on > this plain, fearful of the strength of their cavalry, he adopted a device > which Harpagus, one of the Medes, suggested to him. He collected together > all the camels that had come in the train of his army to carry the > provisions and the baggage, and taking off their loads, he mounted riders > upon them accoutred as horsemen. These he commanded to advance in front of > his other troops against the Lydian horse...\\" > \\"Astyages, meanwhile, took the son of Harpagus, and slew him, after which > he cut him in pieces, and roasted some portions before the fire, and boiled > others...\\" > \\"When Cyrus grew to manhood, and became known as the bravest and most > popular of all his compeers, Harpagus, who was bent on revenging himself > upon Astyages, began to pay him court by gifts and messages...\\" > \\"Upon Mazares' death, Harpagus was sent down to the coast to succeed to his > command. He also was of the race of the Medes, being the man whom the Median > king, Astyages, feasted at the unholy banquet, and who lent his aid to place > Cyrus upon the throne...\\" > \\"After conquering the Ionians, Harpagus proceeded to attack the Carians, > the Caunians, and the Lycians. The Ionians and Aeolians were forced to serve > in his army...\\" The Chronicle of Nabonidus: > \\"King Astyages called up his troops and marched against Cyrus, king of Anšan > (southwest Iran), in order to meet him in battle. The army of Astyages > revolted against him and in fetters they delivered him to Cyrus. Cyrus > marched against the country Ecbatana; the royal residence he seized; silver, > gold, other valuables of the country Ecbatana he took as booty and brought > to Anšan.\\"On-line text in translation Military career After the defeat of Astyages (550 BC) Harpagus started - according to Herodotus - a military career under the new ruler Cyrus II: * Harpagus suggested using camels as the front line against the Lydians in Cyrus II's war against Croesus, thereby scattering the Lydian cavalry (the horses panicked at the smell of the dromedaries). * Following a revolt by the Lydians and the death of Cyrus's infantry commander, General Mazares, Cyrus II turned over the conquest of Asia Minor to Harpagus, who went on to serve as Cyrus's most successful general. * The Median general followed his victory at Lydia by conquering Ionia, Phoenicia, Caria, Lycia and many other regions of Asia Minor (except Miletus, which had earned the favor of Cyrus through their great sage Thales's advice to stay neutral in the Lydian war). * Harpagus was also known for innovations in engineering techniques; specifically, the use of earthwork ramps and mounds during sieges (a method later employed by Alexander the Great during his siege of Tyre) and the use of mountain climbers to scale opponents' walls: * Despite Harpagus' reputation for mercy, the residents of Xanthos in Lycia committed suicide rather than surrender to him, saying that they had never been conquered. Later life After the completion of his conquests, Harpagus was appointed Satrap of Asia Minor. His descendants are claimed as the royal family of Lycia in what is now southwest Turkey.

Recent phylogenetic studies have shown that Chamaesyce is deeply nested within the broader Euphorbia. Specifically, Chamaesyce is very closely related to plants like Euphorbia pulcherrima, the popular poinsettia (this and related plants have also been given in their own genus, Poinsettia, but are also well nested within Euphorbia). Currently, all species have now been reclassified as species of Euphorbia. Specifically, this group now belongs to Euphorbia subgenus Chamaesyce section Anisophyllum (which can be abbreviated Euphorbia sect. Anisophyllym). Taxonomically speaking, Chamaesyce is considered a synonym of Euphorbia. Euphorbia sect. Anisophyllum is a large group with about 365 species. Euphorbia sect. Anisophyllum differs from other Euphorbia species in a number of characteristics. Perhaps the most important is the presence of C4 photosynthesis in all but one subsection (subsection Acutae, which represents a basal clade that is made up of species with intermediate C2 photosynthetic pathways). Other characteristics include sympodial branching, dorsi-ventral stems, asymmetric leaves, non-glandular stipules, and ecarunculate seeds. Chamaesyce albomarginata, the whitemargin sandmat, is a species with showy bracts, an adaptation to a semiarid region with competition for pollinators. Plants in the group (as with all other species in the genus Euphorbia) bear tiny flowering structures that look like single true flowers, as if each one were a flower with many stamens surrounding a single ovary. In fact, the structure is a cyathium (sometimes called a pseudanthium, meaning a \\"false flower\\"). It is made up of many small flowers, but with each flower reduced to only the functional organs of sexual reproduction: a single stamen or a single pistil without petals or sepals. Under magnification it can be seen that what appear to be many stamens plus the gynoecium of a single flower, actually form an inflorescence surrounded with many staminate flowers surrounding a single pistillate flower. Each individual staminate flower contributes only a single stamen and retaining no other structure apart from a vestigial stalk below the base of the stamen's filament. That stalk joins the capitulum or base of the inflorescence -- the flowering head. Similarly, what appears to be the flower's ovary is the gynoecium of a single pistillate flower that has lost all the other associated organs of a flower. What appear to be the petals of an individual flower are in fact appendages produced by glands that are produced by bracts (collectively called the involucre), adapted leaves attached below the cyathium. These bracts are fused into a cup-like structure. In some species, such as Chamaesyce albomarginata, the glandular appendages are quite showy.

Sturgis (June 11, 1822 – September 28, 1889) was a senior officer of the United States Army. A veteran of the Mexican War, Civil War, and Indian Wars, he attained the rank of Brevet Major-General. Early life and career Samuel Davis Sturgis was born in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. His parents were Mary Brandenburg and James Sturgis. He entered the United States Military Academy at the age of twenty and was graduated 32/59 in the famous class of 1846 as a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd Dragoons. That class also included among its graduates John Gibbon, George B. McClellan, Jesse Reno, and George Stoneman, who would fight on the Union side and Ambrose Powell Hill, Thomas Jonathan \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, and George Pickett, who would fight on the Confederate side. During the Mexican War, he served with the 1st Dragoons and was captured and held for eight days as a prisoner of war while making a reconnaissance near Buena Vista, Mexico. After the war, he served in the West, was promoted to first lieutenant and captain, and took part in a number of Indian campaigns. During this time, Sturgis was sent to West Ely, Missouri, where he met Jerusha Wilcox. In 1851 they married and would have six children.Sturgis, Jerusha Wilcox, Life of Mrs. S. D. Sturgis, U.S. Military Academy Library, West Point, New York Civil War When the Civil War broke out, Sturgis continued to serve with the 1st Dragoons (which was shortly afterwards redesignated the 1st Cavalry Regiment). He was promoted to major in May 1861 and later transferred to the 4th Cavalry Regiment. In August 1861, at the Battle of Wilson's Creek, he succeeded to command of the Federal forces after the death of Brig. Gen. Nathaniel Lyon. In March 1862 he was appointed brigadier general of volunteers to rank from August 10, 1861, the day of the battle, as well as breveted lieutenant colonel, Regular Army. After a tour of duty in the Washington, D.C., defenses, he was ordered to the front to support General John Pope's Army of Virginia just prior to the Second Battle of Bull Run. While attempting to secure priority from General Herman Haupt for movement of his troops on the railroad, he was told that he must wait his turn as other troops and supplies were going forward to support Pope. His reaction was his now-famous remark, \\"I don't care for John Pope one pinch of owl dung.\\" Sturgis then commanded the 2nd Division in the IX Corps at the battles of South Mountain, Antietam, and Fredericksburg. He went west with IX Corps in 1863 and was promoted to lieutenant colonel with the 6th U.S. Cavalry on October 27, 1863 and had a number of relatively unimportant commands in Tennessee and Mississippi. He commanded the Cavalry Corps of the Department of the Ohio conducting operations in the vicinity of Dandridge, Tennessee during the Winter of 1863-1864. In June 1864 he was routed by Nathan Bedford Forrest at the Battle of Brice's Crossroads in Mississippi, an encounter that effectively ended his Civil War service. After the Civil War Sturgis was breveted brigadier general (for South Mountain) and major general (for Fredericksburg), Regular Army, in March 1865 and mustered out of the volunteer service in August. He reverted to his regular rank of lieutenant colonel of the 6th U.S. Cavalry. On May 6, 1869, he became colonel and commander of the 7th U.S. Cavalry and his lieutenant colonel was George Armstrong Custer. Sturgis was on detached duty as the Superintendent of Mounted Recruiting Service and in command of the Cavalry Depot in St. Louis, Missouri, when parts of the 7th Cavalry were destroyed at the Battle of Little Big Horn (one of Sturgis's sons, Second Lieutenant James G. Sturgis, was also an officer with the 7th and was killed in that battle.) Samuel Sturgis then took personal command of the regiment and led the 7th Cavalry in the campaign against the Nez Percé in 1877. Sturgis and his soldiers headed off the Nez Percé and waited to attack them once they emerged from their passage through the wilderness of Yellowstone Park. The Indians deceived Sturgis with a feint and eluded him, continuing their flight northward toward Canada. Sturgis soon caught up with the Nez Percé but at the Battle of Canyon Creek, the Indians, although outnumbered two to one, again escaped from his grasp.\\"Battle of Canyon Creek Photo Tour\\", accessed 3 Dec 2012 From 1881 until 1886, Sturgis was governor of the Soldiers' Home in Washington, D.C. He retired in 1886 and died in Saint Paul, Minnesota in 1889. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. His son Samuel D. Sturgis, Jr. became a general in the United States Army, and was a division commander in the American Expeditionary Force during World War I. His grandson Samuel D. Sturgis, Jr. also became a general in the United States Army and served as Chief of Engineers from 1953 to 1956. Legacy The city of Sturgis, South Dakota, is named for Samuel D. Sturgis.

Her work combined sentimental, romantic themes with social issues of the day, such as women's rights and race relations. She was one of the most widely read female authors of the 20th century, and for a time in the 1920s she was one of the highest-paid American writers, along with Booth Tarkington. Hurst also actively supported a number of social causes, including feminism, African American equality, and New Deal programs. Although her novels, including Lummox (1923), Back Street (1931), and Imitation of Life (1933), lost popularity over time and were mostly out-of-print as of the 2000s, they were bestsellers when first published and were translated into many languages. She also published over 300 short stories during her lifetime. Hurst is known for the film adaptations of her works, including Imitation of Life (1934), starring Claudette Colbert, Louise Beavers, Fredi Washington, and Warren William; Imitation of Life (1959), starring Lana Turner; Humoresque (1946), starring Joan Crawford; and Young at Heart (1954), starring Frank Sinatra. Early life Sketch by Marguerite Martyn of Hurst in her last year at Washington University, 1909 Hurst was born on October 19, 1885, in Hamilton, Ohio, to shoe-factory owner Samuel Hurst and his wife Rose (née Koppel), who were assimilated Jewish emigrants from Bavaria. A younger sister died of diphtheria at age three, leaving Hurst as her parents' only surviving child. She grew up at 5641 Cates Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri and was a student at St. Louis's Central High School. She attended Washington University and graduated in 1909 at age 24. In her autobiography, she portrayed her family as comfortably middle-class, except for a two-year stint in a boarding house necessitated by a sudden financial downturn, which sparked her initial interest in the plight of the poor. However, this has been challenged by later researchers, including her biographer Brooke Kroeger and literary historian Susan Koppelman. According to Koppelman, while Fannie Hurst was growing up, her father changed businesses four times, never achieved much financial success, and failed in business at least once, and the Hurst family lived at 11 different boarding houses before Fannie turned 16. Kroeger wrote that while Samuel and Rose Hurst did eventually move to a house in a fashionable section of St. Louis, this did not occur until Fannie Hurst's third year of college, rather than during her childhood. In her last term in college, Hurst wrote the book and lyrics for a comic opera, The Official Chaperon, which was given on the Washington University campus in June 1909.Untitled, St. Louis Post- Dispatch, May 30, 1909, image 8, column 5Marguerite Martyn, \\"Marguerite Martyn Discovers Real College Playwright in Fannie Hurst,\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, June 17, 1909, image 13Brooke Kroeger, Fannie Hurst: The Talent for Success of Writer Fannie Hurst, 2013, location 272 After her college graduation, Hurst briefly worked in a shoe factory before moving to New York City in 1911 to pursue a writing career. Despite having already published one story while in college, she received more than 35 rejections before she was able to sell a second story and establish herself as a regularly published author. During her early years in New York she worked as a waitress at Childs and a sales clerk at Macy's and acted in bit parts on Broadway. As Hurst worked these jobs, under the name Rose Samuels, she observed her customers as well as employees. She began to take note of important social issues like unequal pay and gender inequality. In her spare time, Hurst attended night court sessions and visited Ellis Island and the slums, becoming in her own words “passionately anxious to awake in others a general sensitiveness to small people,” and developing an awareness of “causes, including the lost and the threatened.” Frederick, A.(1980).

Retrieved from Simmons College Library Career Fannie Hurst, 1914 In the years after World War I, Hurst became famous as an author of extremely popular short stories and novels, many of which were made into films. Her popularity continued for several decades, only beginning to decline after World War II. Throughout her life, Hurst also actively worked and spoke on behalf of social justice organizations and causes supporting feminism and African-American civil rights, and occasionally supported other oppressed groups such as Jewish refugees (although she chose not to support some other Jewish causes), homosexuals, and prisoners. She was also appointed to several committees associated with President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs. =Author= In 1912, after numerous rejections, Hurst finally published a story in The Saturday Evening Post, which shortly thereafter requested exclusive release of her future writings. She went on to publish many more stories, mostly in the Post and in Cosmopolitan magazine, eventually earning as much as $5,000 per story. Her first collection of short stories, Just Around the Corner, was published in 1914, and her first novel, Star-Dust: The Story of an American Girl, appeared in 1921.Hurst, Fannie 1885Fl - 1968.

Retrieved from Simmons College Library By 1925, she had published five collections of short stories and two novels, and become one of the most highly paid authors in the United States. It was said of Hurst that \\"no other living American woman has gone so far in fiction in so short a time.\\" Her works were designed to appeal primarily to a female audience, and usually had working-class or middle-class female protagonists concerned with romantic relationships and economic need (see Major themes). Her work was described in 1928 as \\"overwhelmingly prodigal of both feeling and language...mix[ing] naked, realistic detail with simple unrestrained emotion.\\" Hurst was heavily influenced by the works of Edgar Lee Masters, particularly Spoon River Anthology (1916), and also read the works of Charles Dickens, Upton Sinclair, and Thomas Hardy. Hurst considered herself to be a serious writer, and publicly disparaged the works of other popular authors such as Gene Stratton-Porter and Harold Bell Wright, dismissing Wright as a \\"sentimental\\" author whose works people read only for \\"relaxation\\". Early in Hurst's career, critics also considered her a serious artist, admiring her sensitive portrayals of immigrant life and urban working girls. Her stories and books regularly made annual \\"best-of\\" lists, and she was called a female O. Henry. Her second novel, Lummox (1923), about the tribulations of an oppressed domestic servant, was praised for its insights by Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Eleanor Roosevelt. However, some reviewers criticized her for \\"sappy\\" plots and careless writing, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his 1920 novel This Side of Paradise, had a character presciently describe Hurst as one of several authors \\"not producing among 'em one story or novel that will last 10 years.\\" Beginning in the late 1930s, critics no longer took her seriously and sometimes expressed frustration about the continued popularity of her work in the face of bad reviews. In the post-World War II era, she was regarded as merely a popular author who wrote for and about the working classes. She became a favorite target of parodists, including Langston Hughes, who parodied her racially themed novel Imitation of Life as Limitations of Life. Her own editor, Kenneth McCormick, described her as a \\"fairly corny artist\\" but a \\"wonderful storyteller\\". She was also called the \\"Queen of the Sob Sisters\\", \\"sob sister\\" being a term used in the early 20th century for female reporters who wrote sentimental human interest stories designed to evoke an emotional response from female readers. Hurst herself recognized that she was \\"not a darling of the critics\\" but said, \\"I have a vast popular audience — it warms me, like a furnace.\\" SS Leviathan with a dog in 1925 in New York The great popularity of Hurst's works gave her major celebrity status. Hurst also took steps to publicize herself for purposes of promoting both her writing and the activist causes she espoused (see Social activism). In the 1920s, news media widely covered aspects of her personal life such as her unconventional marriage (see Personal life and death) and a diet on which she lost 40 pounds. She was frequently interviewed about her views on subjects relating to love, marriage and family. For decades, The New York Times continued to report regularly on Hurst's doings, including her walks in Central Park with her dogs, her travels abroad, her wardrobe, and the interior decoration of her apartment. Back Street (1931), Hurst's seventh novel, was hailed as her \\"magnum opus\\" and has been called her \\"best loved\\" work. Its main character, a confident, independent young gentile woman, falls in love with a married Jewish banker and becomes his secret mistress, sacrificing her own life in the process and ultimately meeting a tragic end. Hurst's next novel, Imitation of Life (1933), was also hugely popular, and is now considered her best known and most famous novel. It told the story of two single mothers, one white and one African American, who become partners in a successful waffle and restaurant business (modeled after Quaker Oats Company's \\"Aunt Jemima\\" pancake mix) and have conflicts with their teenage daughters. Hurst's inspiration for the book was her own friendship with African-American author Zora Neale Hurston. However, Imitation of Life and the two films based on it provoked controversy due to the treatment of African-American characters, including a romanticized mammy figure and a \\"tragic mulatta\\" who rejects her loving mother in order to pass for white. Approximately 30 films were made from Hurst's fiction. Back Street was the basis for three films of the same name in 1932, 1941 and 1961, plus a fourth film written by Frank Capra, Forbidden (1932), which liberally borrowed elements from Hurst's novel without crediting her. Imitation of Life was twice adapted for film in 1934 and 1959. Both were respectively inductees for the 2005 and 2015 National Film Registry lists. It was also adapted by Joselito Rodriguez for the 1949 Mexican film Angelitos negros (\\"Little Black Angels\\"), which was remade in 1970 as both a film and a telenovela. Her short story \\"Humoresque\\", published in 1919, was made into a 1920 silent film and a 1946 film noir starring Joan Crawford. A later story, \\"Sister Act\\", published in Cosmopolitan in 1937, inspired the musical films Four Daughters (1938) and the Frank Sinatra vehicle Young at Heart (1954). MGM reportedly paid her a million dollars for the rights to her 1936 novel Great Laughter. Hurst continued to write and publish until her death in 1968, although the commercial value of her work declined after World War II as popular tastes changed. Her total publications over her nearly six-decade career include 19 novels,Many sources list the total number of her novels as 18, and omit The Name is Mary, which was published in 1951 by Dell as a romance paperback after its original 1946 publication in The American Magazine. over 300 short stories (63 of which were gathered in eight short-story collections), four plays produced on Broadway, a full-length autobiography and an autobiographical memoir, numerous magazine articles, personal essays, articles (often unsigned) for various organizations to which she belonged, and screenplays (both independently written and collaborations) for several films. =Social activism= Eleanor Roosevelt (left) with Hurst in 1962 Throughout her life, Hurst was involved with many social activist groups supporting equal rights for women and African Americans, and occasionally assisting other people in need. In 1921, Hurst was among the first to join the Lucy Stone League, an organization that fought for women to preserve their maiden names. She was a member of the feminist intellectual group Heterodoxy in Greenwich Village, and was active in the Urban League. She volunteered as a regular visitor to inmates of a women's prison in Manhattan. During World War II she raised money to help Jewish refugees fleeing Europe, but in her earlier years was less supportive of other Jewish causes, saying in a 1925 interview that Zionism \\"segregates us, raises barriers or creates race prejudice\\". Her attitude changed in the 1950s, and in 1963 she received an honorary award from the Zionist women's organization Hadassah. During the 1930s and 1940s, Hurst was a friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and a frequent White House visitor. Hurst was named chair of the National Housing Commission in 1936–1937 and appointed to the National Advisory Committee to the Works Progress Administration in 1940. She was a delegate to the World Health Organization in 1952. In 1958, Hurst briefly hosted a television talk show out of New York called Showcase. Showcase was notable for presenting several of the earliest well-rounded discussions of homosexuality and was one of the few programs on which homosexual men spoke for themselves rather than being debated by a panel of \\"experts\\".Tropiano, pp. 4–5 Hurst was praised by early homophile group the Mattachine Society, which invited Hurst to deliver the keynote address at the Society's 1958 convention. Life and death In 1915, Hurst secretly married Jacques S. Danielson, a Russian émigré pianist. Hurst kept her maiden name and the couple maintained separate residences and arranged to renew their marriage contract every five years, if they both agreed to do so. The revelation of the marriage in 1920 made national headlines, and The New York Times criticized the couple in an editorial for occupying two residences during a housing shortage. Hurst responded by saying that a married woman had the right to retain her own name, her own special life, and her personal liberty. Hurst and Danielson had no children, and remained married until Danielson's death in 1952. After his death, Hurst continued to write weekly letters to him for the next 16 years until she died, and regularly wore a calla lily, the first flower he had ever sent her. During the 1920s and 1930s, while she was married to Danielson, Hurst also had a long affair with Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson.Fannie Hurst.

Lebanon: University Press of New England, 2005. .Robert Shulman. Romany Marie: The Queen of Greenwich Village (p. 144). Louisville: Butler Books, 2006. . They often met at Romany Marie's café in Greenwich Village when Stefansson was in town. According to Stefansson, at one point Hurst considered divorcing Danielson in order to marry him, but decided against it. Hurst and Stefansson ended their relationship in 1939. Hurst was friends with many leading figures of the Harlem Renaissance, including Carl Van Vechten and Zora Neale Hurston, who during her time at Barnard College worked as Hurst's secretary and later traveled with her. In 1958, Hurst published her autobiography, Anatomy of Me, which described many of her friendships and encounters with famous people of the era such as Theodore Dreiser and Eleanor Roosevelt. Overweight as a child and young woman, Hurst had a lifelong concern about her weight. She was known in literary circles as an avid dieter and published an autobiographical memoir about her dieting, No Food With My Meals, in 1935. Hurst died on February 23, 1968, at her apartment in New York City, after a brief illness. A few weeks before she died, she sent her publishers two new novels, one untitled and the other entitled Lonely is Only a Word. Her obituary appeared on the front page of The New York Times. Major themes Combining sentimentality with social realism, Hurst's fiction focuses on American (including immigrant) working- class and middle-class women who attempt to balance societal expectations and economic needs with their own desires for fulfillment. Many Hurst characters, male and female, are working people trying to rise above their class. Abe C. Ravitz described Hurst's themes as \\"women's issues expressed often in myths of sacrifice, suffering, and love\\" and Hurst herself as \\"the laureate of the ghetto and the New Woman\\". For readers unfamiliar with city life, Hurst's experiences allowed her to create accurate depictions of contemporaneous New York City and, in her later works, the Midwest. She often dealt with subject matter considered \\"daringly frank and earthy\\" for its time, including unwed pregnancy, extramarital affairs, miscegnation, and homosexuality. Hurst's work has been criticized for relying heavily on stereotypes, including \\"The Cad, the Alcoholic, the Egotist, the Self-Absorbed Rich Lady, the Golden-Hearted Whore, the Brave Wife, the Pure-Minded Virgin, and the Honest Burgher\\". Women in Hurst's works are generally victimized in some way by preconceived attitudes or social and economic discrimination. including sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and age discrimination. Although Hurst's women often have jobs, economic security for women is typically portrayed as coming through marriage, or sometimes through being a well-paid mistress to a wealthy man. Women whose relationships fail to meet these standards, or who pursue a type of love relationship without economic benefits, suffer deprivation or meet with tragedy. The women's situations are frequently made worse by their own passivity, a trait Hurst deplored; a happy ending often either does not occur, or occurs because of outside forces rather than the afflicted woman's own efforts. Hurst also focused on describing the \\"interior lives of women\\" and how the life choices of her female characters are driven by feelings and passions that they often cannot articulate or explain. Influence and legacy Upon her death in 1968, Hurst left half of her estate to her alma mater, Washington University in St. Louis, and the other half to Brandeis University. The universities used the money to endow professorships in their respective English departments and to create \\"Hurst Lounges\\" for writers to share their work with academics and students. At the time of her death, and for several decades thereafter, Hurst was treated as a popular culture writer, credited with having \\"set the style followed by Jacqueline Susann, Judith Krantz, and Jackie Collins\\" and considered \\"one of the great trash novelists\\". Her works fell into obscurity and largely went out of print. In the 1990s, Hurst's life and work again started to receive serious critical attention, including the formation of a Fannie Hurst Society for interested scholars; a volume of literary criticism by Abe C. Ravitz published in 1997; and a detailed biography of Hurst by Kroeger published in 1999. In 2004, The Feminist Press published a collection of her stories from between the years 1912 and 1935, seeking to \\"propel a long overdue revival and reassessment of Hurst's work\\" and praising her \\"depth, intelligence, and artistry as a writer.\\" Other aspects of Hurst's life and work examined by scholars include her American Jewish background, her friendship with and patronage of Zora Neale Hurston (which Hurston discussed in her own autobiography), the treatment of racial issues in her novel Imitation of Life and the movies based upon it, and even her well-publicized dieting. She has also been called a pioneer in the field of public relations due to her development of her own strong public persona. In popular culture Hurst was a huge advocate for women maintaining independence their whole lives, even after marriage. In the 1920s, after Hurst revealed her marriage to Jacques Danielson, yet retained her own name and each had their own separate homes, the term \\"a Fannie Hurst marriage\\" was coined to describe a marital arrangement similar to Hurst's, where the husband and wife each maintained their own independent lives, even to the point of living in separate residences. Hurst has been referenced in popular culture to exemplify a popular or lowbrow author, in contrast to serious, literary authors. The theme song of the 1970 Mel Brooks comedy film The Twelve Chairs includes the lines, \\"Hope for the best, expect the worst/ You could be Tolstoy or Fannie Hurst.\\" Hurst is mentioned in a similar vein in the song \\"You're So London\\" by Mike Nichols and Ken Welch, written for the show Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall (1962): \\"You're so kippers, you're so caviar and I'm so liverwurst/ You're so Shakespeare, so Bernard Shaw and I'm so Fannie Hurst.\\" Selected worksShort story collections= *Just Around the Corner (1914) *Every Soul Hath Its Song (1916) *Gaslight Sonatas (1918) *Humoresque: A Laugh on Life with a Tear Behind It (1919) *The Vertical City (1922) *Song of Life (1927) *Procession (1929) *We are Ten (1937)''' =Novels= *Star-Dust: The Story of an American Girl (1921) *Lummox (1923) *Mannequin (1926) *Appassionata (1926) *A President is Born (1928) *Five and Ten (1929) *Back Street (1931) *Imitation of Life (1933) *Anitra's Dance (1934) *Great Laughter (1936) *Lonely Parade (1942) *Hallelujah (1944) *The Hands of Veronica (1947) *Anywoman (1950) *The Name is Mary (1951) *The Man with One Head (1951) *Family!

A hartal is a mass protest, often involving a total shutdown of workplaces, offices, shops, and courts of law, and a form of civil disobedience similar to a labour strike. In addition to being a general strike, it involves the voluntary closing of schools and places of business. It is a mode of appealing to the sympathies of a government to reverse an unpopular or unacceptable decision.Online edition of Sunday Observer - 10 Aug 2003 A hartal is often used for political reasons, for example by an opposition political party protesting against a governmental policy or action. The term comes from Gujarati (હડતાળ haḍtāḷ or હડતાલ haḍtāl), signifying the closing down of shops and warehouses with the goal of satisfying a demand. Mahatma Gandhi, who hailed from Gujarat, used the term to refer to his anti- British general strikes, effectively institutionalizing the term. The contemporary origins of this form of public protest date back to the British colonial rule in India. Repressive action by the colonial British Government and the princely states, which infringed on human rights and on peaceful movement protests to demand an end to British rule in India, often triggered such localized public protests, as in Benares and Bardoli. Hartals are still common in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and in parts of Sri Lanka where the term is often used to refer specifically to the 1953 Hartal of Ceylon. In Malaysia the word is used to refer to various general strikes in the 1940s, the 1950s, and the 1960s such as the All-Malaya Hartal of 1947 and the Penang Hartal of 1967.

They travel through two universes and encounter planets, including a parody of the Earth. The narrative includes irony, parody, sexual topics, and fatalism. The series is a Canadian and German co-production, with some additional funding from Britain's Channel 5. The Sci Fi Channel purchased the series from Salter Street Films and began airing versions of Season 2 episodes for United States' audience in January 2000. Lexx was co-produced by Salter Street Films, later absorbed by Alliance Atlantis. In Canada, Lexx aired on the Alliance Atlantis- owned Showcase network. The series was primarily filmed in Halifax (Nova Scotia, Canada) and Berlin (Germany), with additional filming on location in Iceland, Bangkok (Thailand), Namibia and London. Plot The main characters of the series are the Lexx and its crew. The crew consists of the captain of the Lexx, Stanley H. Tweedle; the love slave Zev/Xev Bellringer; the undead former assassin Kai, last of the Brunnen-G; and the love-crazed robot head 790. Together they are looking for a new home. The background conflict of the series is the war between Mankind and the Insect Civilization, in which each side seeks the annihilation of the other. It was foretold to Kai that one day he will destroy the last remnant of the Insect Civilization. The plot unfolds across a time span of over 6,000 years. Kai's death (or undeath) occurs 2,008 years before the beginning of the events of the series. For the first two seasons, each episode is focused on space travel and usually one different planet. Each of the last two seasons has a single location for all episodes. At the beginning of Season 3 the crew spends about 4,000 years in cryostasis before arriving at the twin planets of Fire and Water. In Season 4, the Lexx reaches our Earth in the present. =First season= Stan, Zev and Kai accidentally steal the Lexx, the most powerful weapon of destruction in the two universes. After successfully fleeing from the Cluster, the main planet of the League of the 20,000 Planets, they are looking for a new home. Kai needs protoblood to live outside of his cryochamber. Looking for protoblood, the Lexx returns to the Cluster to learn that a huge insect survived. This insect had controlled The Divine Order and His Divine Shadow in order to eat all human inhabitants of the 20,000 planets. The insect then begins a metamorphosis into the Gigashadow. Gigashadow produces protoblood. With the help of Zev, Kai manages to fill up his store of protoblood. Kai places the cluster lizard Squish in the brain of the insect and thus is able to destroy it. =Second season= The main conflict of the second season is the fight against Mantrid, the former Bio-Vizier of His Divine Shadow. The crew had inadvertently helped him transfer his mind into a machine in the first episode of the season while accidentally fusing it with a remnant of His Shadow. Mantrid's goal is to transform all matter in the Light Universe into Mantrid Drones. In the meantime the crew keeps getting into difficult situations and is usually rescued by Kai. At the end of the season they destroy Mantrid. Unfortunately, the Light Universe is also destroyed. The crew flees into the Dark Zone. =Third season= The Lexx is running out of food and must fly slowly to conserve energy. 790 computes that it might take thousands of years to reach an inhabited planet. The crew enters cryostasis to survive the voyage. After 4,000 years in cryostasis, they reach the twin planets Fire and Water. The entire third season takes place on these two planets. The crew meets people they knew from the Light Universe. These survivors cannot remember their past in the parallel universe, though their personalities are still the same. Fire is ruled by the charismatic Prince. Water doesn't seem to have a ruler. The inhabitants of both planets live in isolated towns. On Water they live on islands in a huge ocean and on Fire, there are massive towers separated by long stretches of desert. Prince wants to win the crew over to his side, especially Xev. He tests their sense of morality through various temptations. The crew members are frequently separated, forcing them to act individually. After jumping from the Lexx to the surface of Water, Kai has trouble functioning normally without the other crew members. On Water, deep beneath its surface, Kai encounters his soul essence, which awaits rebirth. Stanley dies and a trial is held over the destination of his soul. All his bad decisions are weighted against his good deeds and he is sentenced to eternal punishment on Fire. At the end of the season both planets, Fire and Water, are destroyed. Stan's soul is set free, and is able to return into his body, though he cannot remember what happened to him on Fire. The souls of all inhabitants of Fire and Water are also released, then travel to a planet that looks like Earth. =Fourth season= The Lexx travels to Earth looking for food. It is located in the very center of the Dark Universe and the crew assumes that it must be a very dangerous place. The crew again meet people they knew from the Light Universe, and from Fire and Water. Only Prince and Priest are able to remember their lives on Fire (though presumably Priest can do this only because Prince allows him to). Kai's soul is stuck because he is undead, and he decides to die to release his soul. To do this, he must regain his mortality. He plays chess with Prince to regain mortality and wins, but remains undead. The Earth is threatened by a being who resembles Lyekka. The crew finds out that the fake \\"Lyekka\\" destroyed all human life on her way through the Dark Zone. Kai decides to destroy the asteroid that is the source of the entity. Prince keeps his promise and restores Kai's mortality. Minutes later, Kai finally dies destroying the asteroid, saving all inhabitants of the Dark Zone. 790 destroys the Earth using the senile and dying Lexx. Prince, Priest, and Bunny escape on a rocket filled with Catholic schoolgirls, and Xev and Stan fly off together on the Lexx's offspring, \\"Little Lexx\\", to find a new home. Cast Mantrid before his transference into a computer, accompanied by two drone arms Thodin and his fellow Heretics on the Cluster Music The music of the series was written by Marty Simon. The episode \\"Brigadoom\\" (2.18) is a musical episode. It describes the destruction of Brunnis-2 and the death of Kai. =Soundtracks= There are two Lexx Series soundtracks, as well as the music from the \\"Brigadoom\\" episode. *Lexx The Series Original Soundtrack [GNP Crescendo (2001), Colosseum (1997)] # Opening Theme-Season 3 # 790 Quote (from \\"Brizon\\") # Prince to Lexx (from \\"Fire and Water\\") # All He Wants Is Sex (from \\"Stan's Trial\\") # Angel Song (from \\"Nook\\") # A Walk in the Desert (from \\"Battle\\") # Seduction (from \\"Love Grows\\") # Wild, Wild Lexx # Galley (from \\"Love Grows\\") # Opening Theme: Season 2-Version 1 # Holograms # The Search (from \\"Girltown\\") # Xey's Dream (from \\"The Web/The Net\\") # Garden (from \\"Garden\\") # Lexx Hungry # Into the Garden (from \\"Garden\\") # Lyekka/Potato Hoe # Gondola Ride (from \\"May\\") # Mantrid Medley # Prince Theme (Season Three Mantrid) # Medieval Dance (from \\"Nook\\") # Girl Awakes/Norb Launch (form \\"Lafftrack\\") # The Xev Show (from \\"Lafftrack\\") # Demented Chase (from \\"Lafftrack\\") # Yo-A-O/I'm Leaving (from \\"Terminal\\") # Zev Dies (from \\"Terminal\\") # Final Scene # Opening Theme Season 2-Version 2 *Tales From A Parallel Universe [Varèse Sarabande (1998)] # Cluster Anthem # Prisoner Transport # Snake Chase # Welcome to the Dark Zone # Battle of the Universe # Planet Cruise # Poet Man # Cryochamber # Love Muscle # Gigashadow March # Yo-A-O (Fight Song of the Brunnen-G) # The Lexx Escape # Zev's Shower # Cleric Theme # Kai Collapse # Shadows and Prophets # Feppo's Party # Milk Fed Boys # Brunnis # Fantasy Dance # Moth Ride Episodes There are four seasons of Lexx, totaling 61 episodes. The first season, debuted in Canada on 18 April 1997, and consisted of four two-hour TV movies (sometimes screened as eight one-hour episodes), alternatively titled Tales from a Parallel Universe. However, some episode guides don't list the two-hour movies as a series but list the subsequent seasons as the first through third. The second season consisted of twenty 48-minute episodes, with an overall story arc concerning an evil scientist called Mantrid, who attempts to kill everyone by converting the entire mass of the universe into Mantrid drones; flying, self-replicating right robot arms. The third season consists of 13 episodes in which the Lexx is trapped in orbit around the warring planets Fire and Water, and the crew encounters Prince, the enigmatic and cheerful evil ruler of Fire, who is much like the Devil, though he actually identifies himself as death incarnate at the end of season four. The fictional planet \\"Fire\\" is the afterlife for all evil souls, and the location for much of Season three. It shares a tight mutual orbit and an atmosphere with the Planet Water, which is the afterlife for all good souls in the Lexx universe. Both worlds are locked in a perpetual war.http://sadgeezer.com/LEXX-Season-Three-Review-Episode-01-Fire-and- Water.htm Sadgeezer - Fire and Water The souls on Water and Fire have no memory of how they arrived there; they simply \\"woke up\\" there one day. They are incapable of sexual reproduction and there are no children on either planet. When anyone dies on Planet Fire or Planet Water, they go to a spiritual holding cell in which time stands still, giving the illusion that no time has passed no matter how long they have been there. When space opens up they \\"wake up\\" again whole and healthy on their respective home planet. Fire is destroyed by the Lexx under the command of Xev at the end of Season three. With Fire gone, Prince cannot reincarnate so he instead chooses to possess the Lexx and destroy Water. When Water and Fire are both destroyed, it is revealed that both planets were actually on the other side of the Sun in our solar system and that all the souls contained on both worlds will be reincarnated on Earth.http://sadgeezer.com/LEXX-Season-Three-Review-Episode-13-Heaven-Hell.htm Sadgeezer- Heaven and Hell In the fourth and final season of 24 episodes, the Lexx arrives at Earth in the year 2000, only to find that Prince (now named Isambard Prince and head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which more or less runs the United States) and several other old adversaries have also arrived there. The crew's arrival coincides with a large asteroid-like vessel filled with robotic carrots bent on sampling the flavors of the various lifeforms on Earth. Between them, Prince, and the Lexx several large chunks of the Earth are demolished — including Orlando, Florida; Ottawa (a Canadian metonymical in-joke);Tokyo, the Amazon Rainforest, and Holland, which the Lexx eats — before the climactic final episode, televised on 26 April 2002. The Lexx is responsible for the destruction of Fire, Water, Pluto, Mars, Venus, and lastly Earth. Also, Priest, the President of the United States, manages to destroy Cuba, Newfoundland, and Vietnam via thermonuclear bombs.

Broadcast history and legacy The show's seasons had very different tones. While the original TV movies and the second season were mostly science fiction drama with plenty of dark comedy, the \\"Fire and Water\\" season took a more serious tone, while the show's final season — set on Earth in the year 2000 — took many turns into pure farce and introduced magic (as in the episode A Midsummer's Nightmare) and other new elements. Lexx was shown originally on Citytv in Canada, then later picked up by Space, Channel 5 in the United Kingdom and then the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States. On Sci-Fi, it aired in the same Friday night lineup as Farscape, and the somewhat similar set-up for both shows (with a misfit crew flying through space on a huge, living starship) was often noted by critics, despite Lexx having premiered two years prior to Farscape. Lexx did achieve some mainstream notice (with Xenia Seeberg as \\"Xev\\" appearing on the cover of TV Guide, for instance). Lexx was voted 23rd in a poll by SciFiNow magazine in June 2009 in the \\"25 Greatest Sci-Fi TV Shows\\". On May 20, 2017 (or before) all seasons began to stream from Amazon. =Different versions= There are two versions of Lexx, the European and the American one. One difference is in the beginning of the first film: The American version doesn't include a scene in which Stanley is fooled and captured by Feppo. The European version places this scene between the death of Kai and the time when Stanley wakes up on the cluster (2008 years later). Unlike the DVD edition, the German TV release was re-cut to include some flashback scenes at points where they mattered within the story, and not in the chronological order in which they happened. For example, Stanley's capture by the pirates was shown as a flashback in the fourth episode (\\"Giga Shadow\\") of the miniseries, whereas the DVD version includes it prior to the Cluster scenes early on in the first episode of the show, somewhat out of context.

Since 2020, his voice is provided by YouTuber and voice impressionist Arif Zahir. He was previously voiced by Mike Henry from 1999 until 2020. As one of Peter Griffin's neighbors and friends, Cleveland is also one of the few recurring African American characters on the show. He was conceived during the seventh-inning stretch of a Cleveland Indians game. His established profession was that of a deli owner, before he switched over to being a postal worker after his return to Family Guy. In the earlier seasons of Family Guy, Cleveland frequently appeared alongside his wife Loretta Brown (voiced by Alex Borstein), until their divorce was portrayed in the Family Guy season 4 episode \\"The Cleveland–Loretta Quagmire\\". The pilot episode of The Cleveland Show depicts Cleveland's farewell to the familiar characters and settings of Family Guy. The Cleveland Show establishes its setting of Stoolbend, Virginia as Cleveland's childhood home town, and introduces a new family and set of characters supporting Cleveland as lead. Following The Cleveland Show's cancellation in 2013, Cleveland returned to Family Guy the following year. Personality Cleveland is usually depicted as exceedingly peaceful, patient, and sweet, and only on rare occasions has he been known to lose his temper and resort to violence. However, Cleveland gets visibly annoyed with racist behavior. He often acts as the voice of caution when other characters hatch harebrained schemes. Cleveland's speech is slow, almost elongated. Various flashbacks give conflicting histories of his speech patterns. A flashback in the episode \\"Death Lives\\" shows that Peter Griffin met Cleveland in the 1970s, when Cleveland already spoke in the slow manner that he is known for. Likewise, in the premiere of his spin-off, it is revealed that Cleveland talked in a slow manner when he was in high school. In the fourth season episode \\"Blind Ambition\\", an out-of-continuity flashback depicts Cleveland as a fast-talking auctioneer when a totem pole falls over onto his head, resulting in a slower rate of speech. One of the running gags throughout the series is that Peter's shenanigans frequently destroy the front wall of Cleveland's house, revealing him in the bathtub. He then exclaims: \\"No, no, no, no, no, no, no!!!!!\\" as the upstairs floor tilts and the tub crashes to the ground. In the pilot of his spin-off, this gag was the last straw that convinced Cleveland to leave Quahog. However, even several states away, the Griffins' antics are still seen to cause this event, such as when debris from the missile that Brian, Stewie, Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase destroy happens to fall right on Cleveland's new house in the episode \\"Spies Reminiscent of Us\\". In \\"Brian's Got a Brand New Bag\\", Cleveland's now-unoccupied house is destroyed when Peter watches the movie Road House and beats up Brian, which results in a car crashing into the house, and the empty bathtub crashes to the ground. Afterward, Peter says \\"Oh, that's right. Cleveland moved.\\" In the Cleveland Show episode \\"Gone with the Wind\\", the same running gag affects his former wife Loretta Brown, and she winds up dead after breaking her neck on the ground. In Something, Something, Dark Side, this gag is parodied when R2-D2 (played by Cleveland) slips off Luke's (Chris Griffin) X-Wing ship and falls into the swamp after they crash land on Dagobah. Cleveland's bathtub accidents have been caused by Peter's giraffe stumbling backwards into his house, the flying missile as stated above, Peter and Lois trying to move their mentally retarded horse by driving into it, missing, and driving into his house, and other accidents. Cleveland sometimes will show some sexual deviance or arousal towards attractive women. This is shown in the episode \\"Petarded\\", when Peter brings seven prostitutes into his house to get back custody of his children and prove to child services that Cleveland is an unfit father. Cleveland responds, \\"Peter! You and five of those prostitutes get out!\\" In the Family Guy episode \\"Love Blactually\\", it is suggested that he may have contracted genital warts by having sex with a woman with whom Brian was previously involved. Additionally, Cleveland has \\"no toenails anyhow\\" according to season 14 episode 19 \\"Run, Chris, Run\\" in which he and Jerome discuss a toenail fungus commercial. Development Writers named the character Cleveland Brown in reference to the similarly named football team, although his last name was not revealed until after Family Guy returned from cancellation in 2005. Furthering this connection, a commercial aired during Super Bowl XLV that showed many TV characters wearing NFL jerseys, with everyone in Quahog wearing New England Patriots jerseys except Cleveland, who is wearing a Cleveland Browns jersey in reference to his name. Mike Henry was the original voice of Cleveland Brown, and also continues to voice Herbert, as well as some minor recurring characters like the mild-mannered Bruce, Consuela the housekeeper, and the Greased-Up Deaf Guy. Henry met MacFarlane at the Rhode Island School of Design and kept in touch with him after they graduated. A few years later, MacFarlane contacted him about being part of the show; he agreed and came on as both a writer and voice actor. Henry based Cleveland's voice on one of his basketball partners in Virginia. During the show's first four seasons, he was credited as a guest star, but beginning with season five's \\"Prick Up Your Ears\\", he has been credited as a main cast member. Mike Henry, Cleveland Brown's voice actor, in 2018 During a live broadcast of \\"Loveline,\\" Seth McFarlane announced that a Family Guy spin-off featuring Cleveland was currently in the works with the studio and writers. The series was the first new product of MacFarlane's $100 million deal with Fox. The series was mentioned in the final moments of the Family Guy season 7 episode \\"Baby Not on Board\\", with Cleveland telling Quagmire \\"Did I tell you I'm getting a spin-off\\". It premiered on September 27, 2009 on Fox, right after The Simpsons. The Cleveland Show is an animated series focusing on the character of Cleveland Brown and his family as Cleveland moves from Rhode Island to Virginia. His newly introduced family includes his high school sweetheart, Donna, who is now his second wife, her 15-year-old daughter, Roberta, and her 5-year-old son, Rallo. Cleveland Jr. also is in the family but is now much fatter than he appeared on Family Guy, and also suffers from astigmatism. Though several of these details were changed, it was announced that Cleveland's neighbors would include a family of talking anthropomorphic bears, a redneck couple and a Victorian-era British family, and one of his son's soccer rivals includes a boy voiced by Kanye West. Cleveland was officially written out of Family Guy during season eight before The Cleveland Show was broadcast; however, it had been hinted that he might come back for a visit in the future, including the episode \\"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side\\", although fantasies and film parodies are generally accepted as non-canon Family Guy episodes. He appeared in a cameo in \\"Spies Reminiscent of Us\\", in which he dealt with the indignity of having his new house wrecked in the same fashion as his old one in Quahog, as well as appearing in the season 8 episode \\"The Splendid Source\\", where he joins the gang on a road trip to find the source of a dirty joke Chris Griffin told at school. In the Family Guy episode \\"Life of Brian\\", Cleveland and Donna are seen mourning over Brian's (now undone) death. Again he appears for a full episode in season 10, \\"Cool Hand Peter\\" where he, Peter, Joe, and Quagmire go on a road trip to Louisiana together. Cleveland makes yet another short appearance in season 8, Episode 13 \\"Go Stewie Go\\", where Cleveland appears in the Griffins' house along with other characters just to investigate Meg's normal boyfriend. Another idea had been that Peter Griffin and possibly other Family Guy characters would be traveling in the South and make a guest appearance on The Cleveland Show. Additionally, Cleveland appeared at the end of the American Dad! episode \\"Hurricane!\\", which was part of a crossover storyline with Family Guy and The Cleveland Show. The Cleveland Show aired its last episode on May 13, 2013 and was cancelled on July 16. On the same day, Seth MacFarlane revealed that Cleveland will return to Family Guy during the 12th season in the episode \\"He's Bla-ack!\\". In that episode, Peter, Quagmire, and Joe mock The Cleveland Show, but still accept him back into their group of friends. Lois and Donna have an argument about parenting which ends with the two women forbidding their husbands to be friends with each other anymore. However the fight is eventually resolved and Peter and Cleveland can be friends again. Cleveland replaces Mort Goldman in the opening credits soon after the episode on-wards. On June 26, 2020, Mike Henry, who is white, announced on Twitter that he was stepping down from voicing the character for twenty years, stating \\"persons of color should play characters of color.\\" Actor Wendell Pierce launched a campaign to become Henry's replacement afterwards. On September 25, 2020, it was announced that a YouTube actor and voice impression artist named Arif Zahir, who is African-American, would replace Henry as Cleveland, but some episodes produced before Henry's retirement from the role will still see Henry voicing the character.

Until his death, he was in charge as CEO for over 35 years and was also on the board of the Dutch airline, which was to become one of the most important airlines in the world under his leadership. He was born as the son of an egg trader from The Hague. In 1915 he joined the mobilized Dutch airforce as a professional officer, at the time still called the \\"militaire luchtvaartafdeling\\" (military aviation department), in Soesterberg. After World War I, in which the Netherlands remained neutral, he started the organization of ELTA, the \\"Eerste Luchtverkeer Tentoonstelling Amsterdam\\" (First Aviation Exhibition Amsterdam), held from 1 August till 14 September 1919. For that occasion enormous halls (hangars) were built. Right after the exhibition these were used by Anthony Fokker, for his new company Nederlandse Vliegtuigenfabriek (Dutch Aircraft Factory), subsequently the Fokker airplane factory. All these activities led to the establishment of the Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM), of which Plesman became director, and which he made a flourishing company. After World War II Plesman was appointed president- director of KLM. After the recovery from the war the company became a renowned airline company under his leadership. On 25 February 1946, KLM had the first airline flights from continental Europe to the USA. For his efforts he received in 1947 an honorary doctorate of the Technical University of Delft. Plesman pleaded in vain for a displacement of Schiphol Airport to a location near Burgerveen. The father of the KLM died in The Hague on December 31, 1953.  Biography  Albert Plesman was born on 7 September 1889 to his father, Johan Cornelis Plesman, an egg trader from the Hague and his mother Hendrika van Wessel. He was one of 7 children in the Plesman household. Albert Plesman was raised in Protestant household under the strict rule of his father. He was known to have episodes of obscure or sporadic behavior. These episodes led him to attending the Hogere Burgerschool, a preparatory academy in the Hague of Netherlands. Albert realized great strengths in the mathematics with his time at the school, which spawned an interest in commercial aviation. Upon the death of his mother and his graduation from Hogere Burgerschool, Plesman decided to begin schooling with the Alkmaar Cadet School for service in Royal Dutch East Indies Army. He then attended the Royal Military Academy in Breda, Netherlands, where he first explored his interest in aviation through access to the Gilze-Rijen airfield. Plesman then began his tenure as 2nd lieutenant where his access to aviation expanded. He was exposed to a lieutenant pilot named W.C.J. Versteegh, who flew in a Farman F.20. Plesman was able to explore his desire to fly through Verstegh. Plesman officially became a student cadet of flight in April 1917. Albert Plesman then met Susanna Jacoba van Eijk in early 1917, who he later married in December of that year. Van Eijk gave birth to 3 sons and 1 daughter with Albert. Albert Plesman was recalled as a great family man who realized the importance in family togetherness. He would regularly bring his children to important meetings and events within his company, which was a generally uncommon practice for his socioeconomic stature.Ogier, Frido. “Albert Plesman – KLM's Enterprising (Grand)Father.” KLM Blog, KLM Blog, 23 Feb. 2018, blog.klm.com/albert-plesman-klm-enterprising- grandfather/.  Aviation career  Albert Plesman, together with Anthony Fokker, allowed for the existence of two great Aviation companies in Europe; KLM and Fokker. Europe realized greater connections with North America through Plesman's influence as he pioneered the first commercial transatlantic services. Cargo, mail, and passenger services were greatly a result of Plesman's work within KLM. The first revenue flight of KLM operated from London's Croydon Airport to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. KLM leased their first aircraft, but quickly utilized Fokker. These Fokker aircraft were a product of Anthony Fokker and Albert Plesman's leadership. Their operation of aircraft production followed by the commercial use of those aircraft allowed for a huge growth in travel for Europe internally, to North America, and to the Southeast Asian Dutch Colonies. Albert Plesman later established, in 1921, the largest aircraft maintenance and overhaul plant in the world. This plant was located onsite at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, where KLM concentrated most of their operations. Plesman laid ground for the new KLM headquarters in the Hague during the year of 1939. Plesman advertised progressive business principles for KLM - \\"a commitment to generating customer preference by offering a high- quality product at a reasonable price; strengthening market presence; and achieving internationally competitive costs coupled with a sound financial basis.\\"TIACA. “Albert Plesman.” The International Air Cargo Association, 2018, tiaca.org/hall-of-fame/albert-plesman/. KLM then moved away from the wooden Fokker airplane and transitioned to metal aircraft manufactured in the United States, per Plesman's discretion. In the latter part of 1939, Albert Plesman was forced to suspend all of KLM's operations in the advent of Second World War. His aircraft were withheld and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol came under exclusive military use. He resumed operations in 1946. When KLM was revived, he was officially titled President of the company and conducted the integration of McDonnell Douglas aircraft. He also allowed for greater nationalization of the airline and oversaw the Dutch government's purchase of shares in KLM. Albert Plesman died on December 31, 1953, He left the company in the hands of Fons Aler. The airline continued to grow despite economic difficulties in the late 1950s due to the Dutch government's growing ownership of the company.KLM, About. “History - KLM Corporate.” KLM.com, 2018, www.klm.com/corporate/en/about-klm/students/students-history.html.

His interests included city life, minority group behavior, and mass media, and he is recognised as one of the leading urban sociologists. He was the first president of the International Sociological Association (1949–1952) and the 37th president of the American Sociological Association (1947). Life Louis Wirth was born in the small village of Gemünden in the Hunsrück, Germany. He was one of seven children born to Rosalie Lorig (1868–1948, from Butzweiler/Eifel) and Joseph Wirth. Gemünden was a pastoral community, and Joseph Wirth earned a living as a cattle dealer. The family was Jewish and both of his parents were religiously active. Louis left Gemünden to live with his older sister at his uncle's home in Omaha, Nebraska in 1911. Soon after arriving in the United States, Louis met and married Mary Bolton.Biographical note in the Guide to the Mary Bolton Wirth Papers, University of Chicago The couple had two daughters, Elizabeth (Marvick) and Alice (Gray). Research Wirth studied in the United States and became a leading figure in Chicago School Sociology. His interests included city life, [no minotary group behaviour and mass media and he is recognised as one of the leading urban sociologists. Wirth's major contribution to social theory of urban space was a classic essay Urbanism as a Way of Life, published in the American Journal of Sociology in 1938. In this essay Wirth used Weber’s notion of the ideal type, seeing the urban and the rural as constituting two distinct types of community at opposite ends of a continuum. His research was mostly concerned with how Jewish immigrants adjusted to life in urban America, as well as the distinct social processes of city life. Wirth was a supporter of applied sociology, and believed in taking the knowledge offered by his discipline and using it to solve real social problems. Wirth writes that urbanism is a form of social organisation that is harmful to culture, and describes the city as a “Substitution of secondary for primary contacts, the weakening of bonds of kinship, the declining social significance of the family, the disappearance of neighbourhood and the undermining of traditional basis of social solidarity”.Wirth, Louis (1938) Urbanism as a way of life Wirth was concerned with the effects of the city upon family unity, and he believed urbanization leads to a ‘low and declining urban reproduction rates … families are smaller and more frequently without children than in the country’. According to Wirth, marriage tends to be postponed, and the proportion of single people is growing, leading to isolation and less interaction. But Wirth also stressed the positive effects of city life: \\"the beginning of what is distinctively modern in our civilization is best signalized by the growth of great cities“;Wirth, Louis (1938) Urbanism as a way of life \\"metropolitan civilization is without question the best civilization that human beings have ever devised“;The City. (The City as a Symbol of Civilization.); The Papers of Louis Wirth, The Joseph Regenstein Library, Special Collections/University of Chicago, Box: 39, Folder: 6 \\"the city everywhere has been the center of freedom and toleration, the home of progress, of invention, of science, of rationality“Life in the City. In: Wirth 1956: p. 206–217 or: \\"the history of civilization can be written in terms of the history of cities“.Wirth, Louis (1940): The Urban Society and Civilization. In: Wirth, Louis (ed.), Eleven Twenty Six The profound social understanding of minority groups that Wirth obtained first- hand as a Jewish immigrant in America, can equally be applied to understanding the problems of other minority groups in society, such as ethnic minorities, the disabled, homosexuals, women and the elderly, all of whom have also suffered, and/or continue to suffer prejudice, discrimination and disenfranchisement from the more numerically dominant members of a host society. It is in this respect that Wirth's path-breaking and insightful work still amply rewards detailed study even today, some seventy years after his original investigations.Wirth, L: \\"The Problem of Minority Groups.\\", page 347 in Ralph Linton (ed.), The Science of Man in the World Crisis, New York: Columbia University Press, 1945.

It is the type site for the Hassuna culture (early sixth millennium BCE). History of archaeological research Tell Hassuna was found in 1942 by Fuad Safar, and excavated in 1943 and 1944 by a team from the Iraqi Directorate General of Antiquities led by Seton Lloyd. Excavations revealed that there was once an advanced village culture that was spread throughout northern Mesopotamia. At Hassuna, six different layers of houses were uncovered, revealing various vessels and pottery that date ~5600-5350 BCE, with each layer becoming more substantial. Similar vessels were found throughout the Middle East, showing that there was an extensive trade network that was present as early as the 6th Millennium BCE. Tell Hassuna and its environment Ancient Near East in 5200-4500 BC (Middle Halaf period) showing Hassuna culture location Tell Hassuna is located approximately southwest of modern Mosul, along the west bank of the Tigris River.

Braidwood, Tell Hassuna Excavations by the Iraq Government Directorate General of Antiquities in 1943 and 1944, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol. 4, no. 4, pp. 255-289, 1945 Hassuna was one of the earliest cultures in Northern Mesopotamia. Before this time, Southern Mesopotamia was considered the cradle of civilization. When settlements began forming in the north, such as Hassuna, Jarmo, Samarra, and Tell Halaf, the north became the important region. The architecture at Hassuna was built of packed mud, with the width varying from 20 to 50 centimeters. The mud-brick technique may perhaps have been developed in Southern Mesopotamia, where mud-bricks were common in the first half of 6th millennium B.C.Harald Ingholt, Anne-Tinne and Mogens Lønborg Friis, Colin Renfrew, Henrik Tauber and others. Tell Shimshara The Hassuna Period, Kommissionær: Munksgaard København 1970 pp.132-133, 1970-1971. Occupation history Hassuna Pottery Levels Around 6,000 B.C., people began moving to the foothills of northern Mesopotamia and practicing methods of dry agriculture. These people were the first known farmers, and Hassuna became one of the most ancient centers for the principal forms of producing economies, such as the cultivation of soil and raising livestock. Evidence of this is shown in the oldest layers of Hassuna. The occupants of Hassuna also led the way in improving agriculture, settling the river valleys, the beginning of irrigation, and progress in all branches of production and culture. Around 6,000 B.C., at Tell Hassuna, adobe dwellings built around open central courts; fine painted pottery was replacing the crude pottery of the earlier levels. Hand axes, sickles, grinding stones, bins, baking ovens and numerous bones of domesticated animals reflect settled agricultural life. Stone tools found at Tell Hassuna do not seem to be as advanced as tools found at other sites of the Hassuna culture, such as Jarmo, and were typically made of flint and obsidian. Female figurines were also used in relation to worship and jar burials, within which food was placed due to belief in the afterlife.\\"Mesopotamia.\\" The Columbia Encyclopedia.

Iraq Museum Pottery found at Hassuna can be divided into three different categories: Hassuna Archaic, Hassuna Standard, and Samarran. These also include painted, incised, and painted-incised ware. =Samarra Painted Fine Ware= The decoration of the Samarra Painted Fine Ware is always monochrome, but it seems as if three types of paint have been used: an ivory black, a dark violet brown, and a medium chocolate brown. Circumstances of firing and variations in the concentration of the paint have caused color changes, so that for example an oxidizing firing of vessels painted with ivory black has produced an Indian red color. In general, the designs of the Samarra Painted Fine Ware are carefully painted. Occasionally, however, parallel lines approach or diverge slightly, and the thickness of some lines varies, apparently due to the use of a soft painting-brush. The outside rim motifs are spaced and limited by groups of horizontal lines.Mortensen, Peder. Tell Shimshara, the Hassuna Period. København: Munksgaard, 1970. Print.Lloyd, Seton, and Fuʼād Safar.

The process is called stereotyping. Types of flong Strictly speaking only moulds of the so called papier-mâché wet process are flongs, but the term was applied more widely to moulds for stereos. The following have been used for moulding type to create stereos: *Clay. Invented by a French printer, Gabriel Valleyre in 1730. He pressed the set-up forme in clay or other earthy substance to make a reverse image, and then poured molten copper into the mould. His copies were not very good, due either to the clay he was using, or the softness of the copper. However, the method was later revived, improved, and used by Government Printing Office in Washington. Hoe & Company included a range of plant for use with the process in their 1881 catalogue. *Plaster of Paris. Gress was already describing this as an old method that had been displaced by the papier-mâché or paper process in 1909.. The plaster process can reproduce finer lines than the paper process, but has the disadvantage that the mould is broken to remove the stereo. This was the process developed by Gad in 1725, where a plaster mould is made of the set-up type. The process was perfected in 1802, but because there were relatively few books that needed repeated print-runs other than bibles or schoolbooks, the process did not come into widespread use for another two decades. The Bank of England printed its notes using stereos from plaster moulds in 1816. Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope had invested a considerable sum of money in developing the process, and he then established and funded a stereotyping plant in London.. However it was not a commercial success and faced considerable opposition from the printing trade.. David noted that it was only with the introduction of the flexible and robust papier-mâché flong in the 1850 that led to the extensive use of stereotyping for novel production. *Papier-mâché or hot process (also called the wet mat process to distinguish it from the dry mat process). The French printer Claude Genoux is frequently credited with inventing the Papier- mâché process and he was granted a French patent for it in 1828. However, the process was described in a 1696 book in the University of Marburg. In the wet process, a number of layers of paper fastened together by a paste made from a range of ingredients, including glue or gum. The paste could be to the stereotyper's own recipe or a proprietary paste. *Dry mat, or dry matrix process. Here there is no need to beat the matrix into the page of type, but simple pressure is enough. The pressures needed are quite high and effectively require a hydraulic press. It appears to have been first invented in 1893 by George Eastwood in England, but versions were also produced in Germany in 1894 and in the United States in 1900. Use of the dry mat process was limited as the wet process could provide better quality, but improvements in the dry mats led to their replacing the wet process. By 1946, the dry mat process had completely taken over in newspaper publishing in the United States. The process for making moulds for electrotypes was similar, except that these were made with soft materials such as beeswax or the naturally occurring mineral wax ozokerite. The thin electrotype shells had to be backed with type metal to a depth of 8mm make them robust enough for use. The papier-mâché flong Partridge describes the papier-mâché process thus: A few sheets of thin paper are soaked in water until soft and then pasted together to form a flong. This flong is beaten into a page of type and dried, thus forming a matrix to receive the molten metal, which, when cooled, becomes an exact duplicate of the type page. A large number of duplicate casts may be made from the same matrix, either in flat form as required for flat-bed presses, or curved to fit the cylinders of rotary presses. The flong was constructed by pasting together two sheets of wetted soft but tough matrix paper and four sheets of strong tissue paper. A rice-straw based tissue paper was used for the side of the flong facing the type. After making up the flong matrix, it can be kept for several days if kept suitably moist by wrapping in a wet blanket for example. The flong slightly larger than the forme was laid over it and then carefully beaten into the forme of type using a brush with stiff bristles. Many gentle blows were better to fewer strong ones. Any hollows in the back of the flong after it was beaten in were filled, either with strawboard or pieces of flong or with a packing compound. The flong was then covered with a sheet of backing paper and moved, still sitting on the forme, to a steam drying table. Here it was covered with four to eight pieces of soft blanket and pressed down to ensure that the flong stayed in contact with the forme while it dried. Drying took six to seven minutes typically, but this depended on the steam pressure. The golden rule for stereotyping was to have cool metal and a hot box to avoid problems with shrinkage cavities on the face of the plate or sinks, where the face of the plate shrank away from the front. Sometimes a casting board was used to slow the cooling at the back of the casting, as this could help to avoid problems due to the flong being a poor conductor. Before casting, the casting box was heated. This could be done by ladling hot type metal into it as many as three times and removing the resulting plate. Alternatively, the mould could be gas-heated. The dry flong was then trimmed, leaving just enough of a margin to go under the gauges in the casting box. These gauges were the pieces of metal, typically an \\"L\\" shaped piece and a straight piece to border the sides and bottom of the flong in the casting box. The flong was then place in the casting box and the gauges placed at its sides. The box was closed up, with scrap paper used to form an apron to help funnel the molten type metal into the box. The type metal mixture used for stereotype plates had from five to ten percent of tin and fifteen percent of antimony, with the balance in lead. The percentage of tin varies with the type of mould as tin makes the cast sharper. Five percent was fine for text letterpress, but ten percent was needed for half-tone blocks. =Illustrations of the papier-mâché process= The following illustrations from \\"Stereotyping and electrotyping etc.\\" (1880) by Frederick J. Wilson show some of the steps in the process of making and using a flong.

Multiple casts Wheedon stated that a limited number of duplicate casts could be made from one flong. However, Partridge states that a large number of duplicate casts may be made from the same matrix. Dalgin states that to his knowledge as many as thirty, and maybe more, plates have been cast from a single flong. Fleishman states that while flongs could make multiple casts, they typically could not be removed and reused. This would seem to be contradicted by Kubler who stated that in 1941, the United States Government Publishing Office in Washington stored over a quarter of a million flongs, and some of those in use were over thirty years old. Etymology of the word flong Wilson notes that the word flong is an English phonetic form of the French word flan, which is pronounced in almost exactly the same way. The word is attributed both to Claude Genoux who used the word flan in his original patent to describe the papier-mâché matrix, and to James Dellagana, a Swiss stereotyper in London. Apparently, when living in Paris, Dellagana was keen on a pastry, called a flan which was built up of different layers. . This is a fairly good description of the way in which the flong is built up, with layers of paper interspersed with paste. Kubler states that the outside of France and England the general term for a papier-mâché mat was not a flong but a wet mat. However, several technical manuals from the United States use the terms including Kubler himself and Partridge, as well as the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics 1929 study of productivity in Newspaper Printing. Further reading Fleishman provides a thorough and well illustrated explanation of the process in his blog.. Dalgin provides a good overview of the mechanics of newspaper production in the middle of the 20th century, including different methods of reproduction. There are also books on the whole stereotype process such as those by Wilson, Partridge, Hatch and Stewart, and Salade.  In popular culture  On 1 April 1977 The Guardian, a UK newspaper published a seven-page special report on San Serriffe an imaginary island to the North-east of the Seychelles The hoax was full of typographical and printing puns, with town named after different fonts. The indigenous inhabitants were said to be the Flong and their language was ki- flong. The hoax is well described, along with images of the pages in the seven page special report which perpetrated the hoax on the Museum of Hoaxes website. The Guardian followed up in 1978 with parodies of twelve UK and Irish newspapers across ten pages: The SS Guardian, The SS Financial Times, The SS Times, The SS Morning Star, The SS Mirror (half page), The SSun (half page), The SS Daily Express (half page), The SS Daily Mail (half page), The SS Irish Times, The SS Telegraph, The SS Sunday Times, and the News of the SS World. However, this was considered to be less successful than the original. Most of the parody newspapers make some reference to the flong. The San Serriffe hoax is ranked fifth in the top one hundred April Fool's Hoaxes by the Museum of Hoaxes.

Circuit preaching became common during and between the Second Great Awakening and Third Great Awakening in the United States. The style was most common west of the Appalachian Mountains, where American settlement pushed westward throughout the 19th century. In the early years of the U.S., many new churches did not yet have a permanent pastor or structure, and in response, the Methodist Episcopal Church, which had a polity allowing it to assign clergy without regard to what the individual minister might desire, assigned ministers to rural and frontier \\"circuits.\\" They became known as circuit riders. With the increase in U.S. population and the rise of urban areas, most church members joined congregations that were large enough that they were not part of a circuit, but many small rural areas kept circuit preachers because it is more economical for churches to share a minister, and because one very small congregation does not provide enough \\"work\\" for a full-time minister. Circuit preaching is a way to provide \\"trained\\" (as opposed to \\"lay\\") clergy for small congregations. Even in the 21st Century it is still common for small congregations of all denominations to share clergy, especially in rural areas of the U.S. Katarina Schuth has published a sociological study of Catholic priests who serve multiple parishes, and some of what she says applies to any \\"circuit preacher\\" clergy.Schuth, Katarina.

Among the first to use three turntables and sound effects, he was known for \\"riding\\" two or more records at a time, and as an innovator of the modern club mix. On September 20, 2004 Tee was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame for his many outstanding achievement as a DJ. Early influences included a musical household (including a classically trained pianist father), and membership in both the boro-wide and citywide choruses. Tee formed a number of 3 and 4 member voice boy singing groups with his neighbors in the 60s, even recording a few demos of original songs, but none of those groups stayed together. After graduating from George Westinghouse High School, Scott was offered a full scholarship to Wilberforce University, but he declined in favor of helping to create this new form of music, which seemed tailor-made for someone whose main interests were popular music (particularly R&B;) and electronics. He received an A.S. degree in computer science from ITT Tech, conferred posthumously. Scott built his reputation at the club Better Days on 49th Street between 8th & 9th Avenues in Manhattan, where he was resident DJ for over six years. Initially he not only DJ'd, he simultaneously worked the light show. With his background in electronics, he was instrumental in designing and installing the lights and sound system in the club. He DJ'd at Club Zanzibar in Newark, New Jersey in the 1980s as well, home to the Jersey Sound brand of deep house or garage house.https://queer.newark.rutgers.edu/history-queer-club-spaces-newark.

The bay looks out onto the English Channel and the Isle of Wight is visible from the beach, as is the Nab Tower lighthouse and the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth. The villages of Bracklesham and East Wittering are situated in the centre of the bay and it is bordered by the town of Selsey on the southern/eastern tip, and the village of West Wittering on the west side. Biology and geology This stretch of foreshore has unimproved grazing pastures, shingle, salt marsh, reed beds and ditches. The pasture is subject to seasonal flooding and it is important for its breeding and overwintering birds. The site has highly fossiliferous Eocene (56 to 34 million years ago) beds with over 160 fish species. There are also much more recent Middle Pleistocene marine deposits dating to around 500,000 years ago which provide a record of changes in sea levels. Medmerry managed realignment scheme Medmerry realignment scheme (geograph 4791022) The earth embankment at Medmerry holding back the sea was originally built in the 1960s however the coastline in the area was subject to frequent flooding events which were becoming unsustainable. The scheme arose out of consultations from the 2008 Pagham to East Head Coastal Defence Strategy with the managed realignment scheme being adopted. In 2013 Environment Agency completed the new 7km inland floodbank and breach in the shingle wall to providing flood relief and this enabled creation of the form the Medmerry RSPB nature reserve.

With . History The Ouray Real Estate and Building Association started construction on the Beaumont Hotel on 5 July 1886, completing it on 15 December 1886 at a cost of $75,000. Palmer House supplied employees for the grand opening, on 25 July 1887. All of the original furniture was made by Marshall Field's. The Beaumont was one of the first hotels in the country to be wired for alternating current electricity. It had guests such as Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover. The hotel closed in 1964 due to declining tourism in the area. For over 30 years the hotel sat empty, boarded up and in disrepair. At one point part of the roof collapsed and more than once the building was considered for condemnation. The hotel was sold in 1998 and was restored, its multiple rooms combined into a more spacious arrangement — the large hotel building now has just 12 guest rooms. It reopened in 2003. Architecture The architectural style of the hotel is a mix of Victorian, Queen Anne and French Second Empire with a slate Mansard roof. Contrary to popular belief, the Beaumont hotel is not a replica of Brown Palace in Denver. In fact, The brown Palace was not built till after the Beaumont. The prominent feature inside the three story brick building is a grand staircase leading into the lobby. A rosewood dining room occupies almost half of the second floor.

May 1) 1804 in Moscow – October 5 (O.S. September 23), 1860 in Moscow) was a Russian theologian, philosopher, poet and amateur artist. He co-founded the Slavophile movement along with Ivan Kireyevsky, and he became one of its most distinguished theoreticians. His son Nikolay Khomyakov was a speaker of the State Duma.  Biography  Khomyakov's whole life was centred on Moscow. He viewed this \\"thousand-domed city\\" as the epitome of the Russian way of life. Equally successful as a landlord and conversationalist, he published very little during his lifetime. His writings, printed posthumously by his friends and disciples, exerted a profound influence on the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian lay philosophers, such as Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Konstantin Pobedonostsev, and Vladimir Solovyov. For Khomyakov, socialism and capitalism were equally repugnant offspring of Western decadence. The West failed to solve human spiritual problems, as it stressed competition at the expense of co-operation. In his own words, \\"Rome kept unity at the expense of freedom, while Protestants had freedom but lost unity\\".History of Russian Philosophy by Nikolai Lossky p. 87 Khomyakov's own ideals revolved around the term sobornost, the Slavonic equivalent of catholicity found in the Nicene Creed; it can be loosely translated as \\"togetherness\\" or \\"symphony\\". Khomyakov viewed the Russian obshchina as a perfect example of sobornost and extolled the Russian peasants for their humility. Khomyakov died from cholera, infected by a peasant he had attempted to treat. He was buried next to his brother-in-law, Nikolai Yazykov, and another disciple, Nikolai Gogol, in the Danilov Monastery. The Soviets arranged for their disinterment and had them reburied at the new Novodevichy Cemetery. Later evaluation of work The Russian religious philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev located Khomyakov's significance in his attempt to free Christianity from rationalism. As he wrote in his 1912 book, Aleksei Stepanovich Khomiakov: > Khomiakov will be eternally remembered, first and foremost, for his > statement of the problem of the Church and his attempt to reveal the essence > of the Church. Khomiakov approached the essence of the Church from within, > not from outside. First of all he did not believe that it is possible to > formulate a concept of the Church. The essence of the Church is > inexpressible; like all living organisms, she cannot be encompassed by any > formula, is not subject to any formal definitions. The Church is, first of > all, a living organism, a unity of love, ineffable freedom, the truth of the > faith not subject to rationalization. From the outside the Church is not > knowable or definable; she is known only by those who are within her, by > those who are her living members. The sin of scholastic theology was that it > attempted to formulate rationalistically the essence of the Church; that is, > it attempted to transform the Church from a mystery known only to believers > into something subject to the knowledge of objective reason.On Spiritual > Unity: A Slavophile Reader by Boris Jakim and Robert Bird For Khomyakov, freedom must be \\"actualized in sobornost, not in individualism\\". However, sobornost is also a site of freedom: > It is difficult to find a freer sense of the Church. Nothing coerces > Khomyakov. In his relation to the Church there is nothing from outside; all > is from within. For him, life in the Church is life in freedom. Indeed, the > Church is unity in love and freedom. The Church is not an institution and > not an authority. The Church has nothing juridical, no rationalization. For > Khomyakov, wherever one finds genuine love in Christ, freedom in Christ, > unity in Christ, there one finds the Church. No formal characteristics > define the essence of the Church. Even the universal councils are genuinely > universal and therefore authoritative only because they are freely and > lovingly sanctioned by the people of the Church. Free sobornost in love -- > this is where one finds the true organism of the Church. This is a very bold > conception of the Church, which must frighten official theologians. This > conception may be alien to theological scholasticism, but it is close to the > spirit of sacred tradition and the Holy Scripture. Khomyakov ascribes > special significance to sacred tradition, since he sees the spirit of > sobornost in it. For him the Holy Scripture is only an inner fact of the > life of the Church, that is, it is grasped through sacred tradition. Berdyaev's contemporary Pavel Florensky, also a renowned religious philosopher, was not so sanguine. In his 1916 pamphlet, Around Khomyakov, he accused Khomyakov of taking away the transcendent truth of Christianity by placing so much emphasis on human agreement. Florensky considers that to be immanentism, which ultimately veers into Protestantism: > Does not Khomyakov, a waterfall of ideas and themes, provoke many acute and > troubling doubts? The chief of this, of course, is the attribution of > Protestantism to Khomyakov. For Khomyakov, the essence of Protestantism > consists only in protest against Romanism, but with the fundamental premises > and characteristic modes of thought of the latter preserved. But is that > really the case? The development of Protestantism and its derivatives after > Khomyakov has undeniably shown that Protestantism, as the chief expression > of the culture of recent times, is based on humanism, the elevation of > humanity, the divinization of humanity. To use a term borrowed from > philosophy, Protestantism is based on immanentism, meaning humanity's > intention to create all reality out of itself, outside of and apart from > God, that is, out of nothing, and, first and foremost, sacred reality; to > create this reality in all senses, beginning with the formation of concepts > and ending with spiritual reality. Meanwhile, the essence of Orthodoxy is > ontologism -- \\"the reception of reality from God\\" as given, not as created > by humanity. The essence of Orthodoxy is humility and gratitude. But what do > we see in Khomyakov? ... Inquiring more attentively into Khomyakov's > theories, we, to our sorrowful surprise, see the same spirit of immanentism > that constitutes the essence of Protestantism, although in an immeasurably > improved form -- chiefly through the introduction of the idea of sobornost > (although the idea of the sobornost of consciousness is not completely > foreign to Western philosophy, for instance, to Kant, not to mention > Schelling of the final period, Feuerbach, Comte, and so on.) ...do not the > very foundations of his opinion seem suspicious to an Orthodox believer when > they are examined attentively? Whereas, for a man of the Church, the Church > expresses the Truth -- for that is \\"the Holy Spirit's desire,\\" and her task > is to discover the truth abiding in God that is independent of her -- > Khomyakov's theory of the Church leaves the impression that the decrees of > the whole Church are true because they are the decrees of the whole Church. > This word whole suggests that the decrees of the Church are not a discovery > of the Truth but an invention of the Truth, as if the Truth were immanent to > human reason, even if the latter is taken in its sobornost, and not > transcendent to human reason and revealed to the latter from its > transcendence. I have used the word impression. Yes, impression, for this > sort of aim could not have distinctly arisen in Khomyakov's consciousness, > and even less could he have expressed it. Khomyakov's thought tends to evade > ontological determinacy, glistening before us in its play of mother-of- > pearl. But this play of surface tones, brilliant but not substantial, and > therefore changing their contours at the slightest turn of the head, does > not yield a stable content of thought and leaves alarm and doubt in one's > heart. Immanentism -- that is the flavor of Khomyakov's theories. Nevertheless, Florensky is by no means dismissive of Khomyakov. He insists that \\"there is hardly any need to doubt the significance of Khomiakov the thinker and the nobility of his person. No one doubts his talents and intellect, nor the purity of his person and the selflessness of his intentions.\\" Works * Полное собранiе сочиненiй. Томъ I-VIII. Москва, 1900-1914.

It is located in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site and is notable for being extremely rich in archaeological material, particularly hominin remains. Fossils discovered in the limestone of Swartkrans include Homo ergaster (a variety of Homo erectus), Paranthropus and Homo habilis. The oldest deposits present at the site are believed to be between 1.9 and 2.1 million years old. Noted paleontologist Robert Broom was a frequent digger. He was followed by C. K. 'Bob' Brain, whose excavations at the site inspired his book The Hunters or the Hunted? in which he demonstrated that instead of being bloodthirsty killer apes, the hominin fossils found at the site were themselves victims of predation by big cats. Originally, it was believed that Dinofelis was responsible for such killings, though recent evidence suggests that hominids were likely the victims of Megantereon or leopards based on carbon isotope ratios taken from each predator. History of investigations Swartkrans is located on the Blaauwbank River in the Cradle of Humankind, which has a long record of some of the oldest hominin remain discoveries in the world. It is located from Sterkfontein, a site that has yielded similar discoveries of the same era. The private farmland the cave was originally on was purchased by the University of the Witwatersrand in 1968. The cave was discovered in 1948, and initial excavations were carried out by paleontologist Robert Broom. His team uncovered several remains of Paranthropus robustus and early Homo species. It was the first site at which both Paranthropus and Homo had been found together, indicating that they were contemporary. Excavation then halted until the mid-1960s and continued until the 1980s, when C. K. Brain brought a team to Swartkrans. Thousands of artifacts and faunal remains were uncovered, 415 of which are considered to be hominin. Brain expanded upon the site's stratigraphy, which was more complex than previously thought. Discoveries A 1979 plan of the cave showing the 1979 excavation grid of C. K. Brain. Some of the earliest evidence of controlled use of fire by humans can be found at Swartkrans, up to 1.5 million years ago. In addition, some of the earliest evidence of modified bone tools has also been found at Swartkrans and Sterkfontein, with the oldest at Swartkrans dating to about 1.8 million years ago. These tools may have been made by Australopithecus robustus or an early species of Homo, which both inhabited the cave around the same time. These early tools were first speculated to have been used to dig up tubers, but they may instead have been used to harvest termites, which were present during Swartkrans's occupation; many of these tools may have been multipurpose. Re- evaluation of wear on stone and bone tools uncovered by Brain in earlier excavations and experiments by researchers have led to the conclusion that termites, a high source of nutrients, were a supplementary food source for early hominids. Bone tools would have allowed for easier extraction of the insects than stones would have. In 2016, the discovery of the earliest known evidence of cancer in hominins was announced. An osteosarcoma was found on a partial left fifth metatarsal from an unclassified hominin. Geology Swartkrans is a limestone cave and has been divided geologically into five members. Member 1 consists of two large masses, named the Hanging Remnant and Lower Bank. Homo ergaster and Paranthropus robustus remains have been found in Member 1, and Member 2 has yielded the same genera.

In Chinese history, Nanyue is considered to be a Chinese kingdom; however in Vietnam, he is considered to be a ruler of the Triệu Dynasty and a king of Vietnam. Name Records from this period were written in classical Chinese and are transliterated, typically into either pinyin (romanized Chinese) or into alphabetical Vietnamese. The name 趙 眜 transliterates as Zhao Mo in pinyin, but as Triệu Mạt in Vietnamese. Zhao/Triệu is a family name, so Zhao Mo's dynasty is referred to as the Triệu Dynasty in Vietnam. His temple name described him as the \\"literary emperor.\\" (; ). Seal of Zhao Mo. The inscription says: . Zhao's name was recorded as Zhao Hu () in the Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian. The name of Zhao Mo did not arise until the discovery of two jade seals belonging to the emperor that bore the name of Zhao Mo but not Zhao Hu. \\"Zhao Hu\\" may have been an error made by Sima Qian when he was writing his Records. There is also a theory that Zhao Mo and Zhao Hu were two separate rulers, and that Zhao Mo's reign was excluded from historical records because of its brief duration. Life Upon Zhao Mo's accession in 137 BC, the neighboring king of Minyue, Zou Ying sent his army to attack Nanyue. Zhao sent for help from the Han dynasty, his nominal vassal overlord. The Han responded by sending troops against Minyue, but before they could get there, Zou Ying was killed by his brother Zou Yushan, who surrendered to the Han. The Han army was recalled. Zhao considered visiting the Han court in order to show his gratitude. His high ministers argued against it, reminding him that his father kept his distance from the Han and merely avoided a breach of etiquette to keep the peace. Zhao therefore pleaded illness and never went through with the trip. Zhao did actually fall ill several years later and died in 124 BC. He was succeeded by his son, Zhao Yingqi. Tomb View of the tomb of Zhao Mo from above The tomb of Wen was discovered in 1983, under Elephant Hill in Guangzhou on a construction site for a hotel, and has been excavated. The tomb measures long and wide. It is divided in seven parts, with a front chamber, east and west wing rooms, the main coffin chamber, east and west side rooms, and a back storage chamber. The tomb has yielded more than 1000 burial artifacts, and a chariot, gold and silver vessels, musical instruments, and human sacrifices were found (15 courtiers were buried alive with him to serve him in death). It is also the only tomb of the early Western Han Dynasty that has murals on its walls. The tomb also yielded the oldest imperial seal discovered in a Chinese tomb: the seal, with the name \\"Zhao Mo\\", declared the royal corpse to be “Emperor Wen\\", indicating that he considered himself equal in rank to the Han ruler. Đông Sơn bronze jars from the tomb Alongside Chinese artifacts, pieces from the steppes, and Iranian and Hellenistic Central Asian regions have been found. A Persian silver box found in the tomb is the earliest imported product found to date in China. There were also artifacts found which belonged to the Đông Sơn culture of northern Vietnam. The Museum of the Mausoleum of the Nanyue King, located in Jiefang road in Guangzhou, stands on the site of the tomb of Zhao Mo.

An unbroken cold chain is an uninterrupted series of refrigerated production, storage and distribution activities, along with associated equipment and logistics, which maintain a desired low-temperature range. It is used to preserve and to extend and ensure the shelf life of products, such as fresh agricultural produce, seafood, frozen food, photographic film, chemicals, and pharmaceutical products. Such products, during transport and when in transient storage, are sometimes called cool cargo.Lou Smyrlis (September 19, 2013). \\"CN's Claude Mongeau preaches 'eco-system of collaboration' at Port Days\\" , Canadian Transportation Logistics, Retrieved September 20, 2013 Unlike other goods or merchandise, cold chain goods are perishable and always en route towards end use or destination, even when held temporarily in cold stores and hence commonly referred to as cargo during its entire logistics cycle. Cold chain logistics includes all of the means used to ensure a constant temperature for a product that is not heat stable, from the time it is manufactured until the time it is used. Moreover, cold chain is considered as a science, a technology and a process. It is a science as it requires the understanding of the chemical and biological processes associated with product perishability. It is a technology as it relies on physical means to ensure desirable temperature conditions along the supply chain. It is a process as a series of tasks must be performed to manufacture, store, transport and monitor temperature sensitive products. Origin Mobile refrigeration was invented by Frederick McKinley Jones, who co-founded Thermo King with entrepreneur Joseph A. \\"Joe\\" Numero. In 1938 Numero sold his Cinema Supplies Inc. movie sound equipment business to RCA to form the new entity, U.S. Thermo Control Company (later the Thermo King Corporation), in partnership with Jones, his engineer. Jones designed a portable air-cooling unit for trucks carrying perishable food, for which they obtained a patent on July 12, 1940, subsequent to a challenge to invent a refrigerated truck over a 1937 golf game by associates of Numero's, Werner Transportation Co. president Harry Werner, and United States Air Conditioning Co. president Al Fineberg, Eight Black American Inventors by Robert C. Hayden Addison-Wesley, 1972; pp. 46- 50. Uses Cold chain being maintained using ice box while transporting polio vaccine Cold chains are common in the food and pharmaceutical industries and also in some chemical shipments. One common temperature range for a cold chain in pharmaceutical industries is , but the specific temperature (and time at temperature) tolerances depend on the actual product being shipped. Unique to fresh produce cargoes, the cold chain requires to additionally maintain product specific environment parameters which include air quality levels (carbon dioxide, oxygen, humidity and others), which makes this the most complicated cold chain to operate. This is important in the supply of vaccines to distant clinics in hot climates served by poorly developed transport networks. Disruption of a cold chain due to war may produce consequences similar to the smallpox outbreaks in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War. There have been numerous events where vaccines have been shipped to third world countries with little to no cold chain infrastructure (Sub-Sahara Africa) where the vaccines were inactivated due to excess exposure to heat. Patients that thought they were being immunized, in reality were put at greater risk due to the inactivated vaccines they received. Thus great attention is now being paid to the entire cold chain distribution process to ensure that simple diseases can eventually be eradicated from society. Traditionally all historical stability data developed for vaccines was based on the temperature range of . With recent development of biological products by former vaccine developers, biologics has fallen into the same category of storage at due to the nature of the products and the lack of testing these products at wider storage conditions. In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines being developed may need storage and transportation temperatures as cold as , requiring what has been referred to as a \\"colder chain\\" infrastructure. The cold chain distribution process is an extension of the good manufacturing practice (GMP) environment that all drugs and biological products are required to follow, and are enforced by the various health regulatory bodies. As such, the distribution process must be validated to ensure that there is no negative impact to the safety, efficacy or quality of the drug substance. The GMP environment requires that all processes that might impact the safety, efficacy or quality of the drug substance must be validated, including storage and distribution of the drug substance. Validation Slurry ice used to ship sensitive food products Truck with cooling system A cold chain can be managed by a quality management system. It should be analyzed, measured, controlled, documented, and validated. The overall approach to validation of a distribution process is by building more and more qualifications on top of each other to get to a validated state. This is done by executing a component qualification on the packaging components, an operational qualification to demonstrate that the process performs at the operational extremes and finally a performance qualification that demonstrates that what happens in the real world is within the limits of what was demonstrated in the operational qualification limits. Performing thermal testing can also help with validating the cold chain. Certified test labs use environmental chambers to simulate ambient profiles that a package may encounter in the distribution cycle. Thermocouple probes and separate temperature dataloggers measure temperatures within the product load to determine the response of the package to the test conditions. Replicate testing based on a qualification protocols is used to create a final qualification report that can be used to defend the configuration when audited by regulators. It is normally best to have an individual that understands the principles of validation, when defending such processes to a federal regulatory body of any nation. Cold chains need to be evaluated and controlled: * Carriers and logistics providers can assist shippers. These providers have the technical ability to link with airlines for real time status, generate web-based export documentation and provide electronic tracking. * The use of refrigerator trucks, refrigerator cars, reefer ships, reefer containers, and refrigerated warehouses is common. * Shipment in insulated shipping containers or other specialised packaging. * Temperature data loggers and RFID tags help monitor the temperature history of the truck, warehouse, etc. and the temperature history of the product being shipped. They also can help determine the remaining shelf life. * Temperature sensors may need to be National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable depending on the body monitoring the cold chain. * Documentation is critical. Each step of the custody chain needs to follow established protocols and to maintain proper records. Customs delays occur due to inaccurate or incomplete customs paperwork, so basic guidelines for creating a commercial invoice should be followed to ensure the proper verbiage, number of copies, and other details. During the distribution process one should monitor that process until one builds a sufficient data set that clearly demonstrates the process is in compliance and in a state of control. Each time the process does not conform to the process, the event should be properly documented, investigated and corrected so that the temperature excursion do not occur on future shipments. Any anomaly is thus considered to be a Non Conformance and should be assigned as a trackable event. The event must be reported immediately when it is identified and it is the expectation of the FDA that all adverse events be documented and investigated. The investigation should be completed in a timely manner and must come to some form of a \\"root cause\\" and also some form of \\"corrective action\\". The system may potentially stay in a Validated state if the root cause identifies that a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was not followed or followed incorrectly. If however a SOP needs to be changed or modified, then the system must be re-validated to demonstrate that the change to the SOP maintains the integrity of the process/system. A Non-Conformance may also generate a Corrective Action Preventative Action (CAPA), again, a documented process to make corrective or preventative actions to SOP's and other documents. Non Conformances and CAPA's are an essential part of the overall Quality System in the cGMP environment. Tracking and trending of these events will also allow businesses to monitor the overall \\"health\\" of the systems in place. Excessive Non Conformances can quickly identify areas of concern for management and allow for corrective actions to be taken. During regulatory inspections of quality systems, inspectors will frequently ask to review a list of all \\"open\\" Non Conformances\\" so that they can quickly assess how an organization is processing these events and ensuring they are dealt with in a timely manner. Thus the process is continually evolving and correcting for anomalies that occur in the process. Eventually the process can evolve into periodic monitoring once sufficient data demonstrates that the process is in a state of control. Any anomaly that occurs once a process is in a state of control may result in the process being invalidated and not in control and could potentially result in product withdraw from the market to ensure patient safety. A formal product withdraw is only done when the quality, safety or efficacy of a product is questionable. A single anomaly would not necessarily require a product withdraw if there is sufficient stability data that demonstrates that excursions will not affect product quality. It is necessary to develop an internal documentation system as well as multi-party communication standards and protocols to transfer or create a central repository or hub to track information across the supply chain. These systems would monitor equipment status, product temperature history, and custody chain, etc. These help ensure that a food, pharmaceutical, or vaccine is safe and effective when reaching its intended consumer. It is also important to have a complete chain of custody for the entire life cycle of a product, so there is documented evidence as to whom had control of the product throughout the lifecycle of the product, up to the final users consumption of the product.

Initially announced in 2005, EnGadget announcement. the XGP was finally announced in March 2006 along with the release of the similar XGP Mini EnGadget report on redesign and Mini version. and the XGP Kids. The company went bankrupt before releasing any of the models. The XGP was scheduled to be released in three models: the XGP, the XGPmini and the XGP Kids. GamePark said that it did not wish to compete with Sony and Nintendo with the device. The XGP Kids was aimed towards children and therefore had a significantly lower price point. It was designed to run simpler games tailored to an audience besides 'hardcore gamers'. While the GP32 was only available in select markets—Korea and parts of Europe and Asia—or had to be imported, the XGP was expected to be marketed worldwide Since Gamepark declared bankruptcy in March 2007, the XGP will not be released. This left GP2X—created by splinter company Gamepark Holdings—as the only successor to the GP32 to make it to market. Models GamePark was planning on releasing three models of the XGP; the high-end XGP, the middle-range XGP mini, and the low-end XGP Kids. =XGP= The XGP system was to focus on downloadable commercial games, as well as on free homebrew content. The ability to use Linux on was officially announced, as well as Windows CE and Gamepark's own minimalistic operating system GPOS. The system was designed for multimedia content such as movies, MP3s, and the mobile television standard T-DMB.

The front gate of the house Location Grange Road continues for nearly a mile to skirt the boundary wall of Marlay Park as far as the crossroads at Taylors Grange beyond which it terminates at a group of farmhouses where there was formerly an old passage leading to Stackstown. On the right the road to Kilmashogue passes the entrance to Danesmoate where there is the valley of the Little Dargle River, a tributary of the River Dodder which rises near the Ticknock rifle range. History The house was built in the 18th century by the Southwell family and in 1787 was the residence of Irish politician and soldier William Southwell. Throughout the following century it was occupied by the Ponsonbys, down to 1896 and later by Professor Stanley Lane-Poole, the author of a number of works on Oriental art and numismatics. For many years down to 1946 it was the home of Lieutenant Algernon Gainsford of the Seaforth Highlanders. In 1986, the house was the site of recording by rock band U2 for their album The Joshua Tree. Bassist Adam Clayton currently owns the house. Clayton built a small watchtower beside the 20-bed mansion, apparently based on the Cruagh Tower. FeaturesThe Brehon's Chair= Within the grounds, in a field visible from the road, is an ancient monument known as the Brehon's Chair, consisting of three tall slabs about nine feet high enclosing a small square space. There was formerly another large slab supported by smaller ones lying to the north east but this was destroyed about 1876 by blasting. The existing remains are apparently the portal portion of a dolmen type of tomb and the stones which were removed would have been part of the destroyed chamber. A similar type of portal can be seen on a dolmen at Haroldstown in County Carlow. =Constructions= Beside the Little Dargle is the remains of a tall narrow tower of which only one wall is now standing. This building was about nine feet square and the remaining wall with its battlements is about twenty five feet high. One jamb of a doorway with a pointed arch remains. A little over a hundred years ago this tower was in much better preservation and was surrounded by the old walls of other buildings from which it has been suggested that this was the site of the original Grange of the Harolds. The existing portion however is of very light construction and quite unsuitable for a building of that period and location, whether intended for domestic or ecclesiastical use. It was probably built in the eighteenth century for the better enjoyment of the view over Dublin Bay. Beside the house is an octagonal building with a cellar underneath. It is now filled up with boughs and brushwood to prevent cattle falling through but is said to be elliptical in shape and was apparently an ice house. On the other side of the brook there is a fine arched gateway in cut stone leading into the pasture land.

It is located within the Nassau Nature Park and the Rhine Gorge UNESCO world heritage site, and was historically part of the Duchy of Nassau. It lies approximately 30 km south of Koblenz, and it is above all famous for the Lorelei rock nearby. Sankt Goarshausen is the seat of the Loreley collective municipality. The town's economy is based on wine making and tourism. The Sankt Goarshausen railway station connects the town with Wiesbaden, Frankfurt and Koblenz. Sankt Goarshausen was formerly the terminus of the Nassau Light Railway line between Sankt Goarshausen and Nastätten. History In 1885, St. Goarshausen had almost 1,456 inhabitants. Close to the town in the hillside just above it, lie the ruins of 14th century Castle Katz, ruined since 1806. Demographics Traditionally more than 60% of the population are Protestants, while around 30% are Catholics; however Sankt Goarshausen is located in close proximity to Catholic-majority areas where the reverse situation exists. Due to the abandonment of religious beliefs, fewer people are members of the churches today, whether Protestant or Catholic. Sankt Goarshausen had a small but well-established Jewish community from the 17th century to the 1930s, peaking at 2.4% in 1895.Sankt Goarshausen, Alemannia Judaica As of 1860, the district of St. Goarshausen, which included St. Goarshausen proper and its surrounding villages, had a population that included 8557 Protestants, 3840 Catholics, 110 Jews and 6 Mennonites.Staats- und Adreß-Handbuch des Herzogthums Nassau für das Jahr 1860, p. 130, Wiesbaden, Government of the Duchy of Nassau Economy Castle Katz with Lorelei rock in the Rhineland-Palatinate The town has 1,585 inhabitants December 31, 2002, and is the seat of the township association (Verbandsgemeinde) Loreley. With the villages Ehrental, Wellmich and Heide, the number of inhabitants is over 2,000. The most important economic areas for St. Goarshausen are tourism and wine making. In earlier times was the town an important place along the Rhein for fishing and as an embarcation area. Today, the formerly very busy town is losing its importance and relies more and more on tourism. Especially problematic for St. Goarshausen is the short distance to the larger city Nastätten, that has replaced St. Goarshausen as the regional centre. In tourism, the biggest competitor is the twin city St. Goar on the other shore of the Rhine. St. Goar is only reachable by ferry, as the closest bridge is 30 km away. While there is an established need for a bridge across the Rhine, plans for connecting the towns have not yet been realised. To help tourism, a visitors centre has been established in connection to the Lorelei rock. Sights The most famous point in town, that also brings the most tourists is the site of the Lorelei rock. In St. Goarshausen there are two castles, Burg Katz (English: Castle Cat, formerly Burg Neu-Katzenelnbogen) and Burg Maus (English: Castle Mouse). Burg Katz is not open for visitors. There is a good view over the town from Burg Maus, and also visible are the ruins of Burg Rheinfels on the other side of Rhine.

Citizen diplomacy may take place when official channels are not reliable or desirable; for instance, if two countries do not formally recognize each other's governments, citizen diplomacy may be an ideal tool of statecraft. Citizen diplomacy does not have to be direct negotiations between two parties, but can take the form of: scientific exchanges, cultural exchanges, and international athletic events. Citizen diplomacy can complement official diplomacy or subvert it. Some nations ban track-two efforts like this when they run counter to official foreign policy. > Citizen Diplomacy is the concept that the individual has the right, even the > responsibility, to help shape U.S. foreign relations, \\"one handshake at a > time.\\" Citizen diplomats can be students, teachers, athletes, artists, > business people, humanitarians, adventurers or tourists.

Fuller, traveled frequently to the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s in the effort to alleviate the Cold War. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Fuller continued this work in political hot spots around the world and developed the idea of reducing rankism to promote peace. The phrase \\"citizen diplomacy\\" was first coined by David M. Hoffman in an article about Fuller's work which appeared in Co-Evolution Quarterly in 1981. Anti-nuclear groups like Clamshell Alliance and ECOLOGIA have sought to thwart US policy through \\"grassroots\\" initiatives with Soviet and (later) former Soviet groups.

The station programs a Christian-based religious format primarily featuring ministry personnel and preachers such as John MacArthur, Alistair Begg, Les Feldick, J. Vernon McGee and Dr. Robert Jeffress. Other individuals may also lease air time on the station. Other hosts such as Eric Metaxas and Lee Michaels provide more interactive programming. The station produces its own afternoon show, Lee Michaels Live! which is hosted by Lee Michaels. This show has replaced \\"The Steven Solomon Show\\". Several other shows are locally produced, such as Understanding the Times with Jan Markell and The Christian World View with David Wheaton. History After two years of wrangling and obtaining start-up funds, WPBC officially signed on the air on October 18, 1949. The station was owned by the People's Broadcasting Company, founded by former WCCO announcer Bill Stewart and his wife Becky Ann. In contrast to WCCO and KSTP, WPBC carried no network programming, and were live and local all day. The station in the early years played a variety of middle of the road pop music and standards, and was even considered an innovator in the concept of singing jingles. As they were limited by their then-daytime only license at 980 AM, they started up WPBC-FM at 101.3 MHz in August 1959, simulcasting the AM station. The Stewarts sold the station in 1972 to Fairchild Industries for $1.5 million. Fairchild subsequently dismissed the entire staff and overhauled both stations. On November 3, 1972, the AM station was relaunched as WYOO, picking up an oldies format (with rock and roll included). A few days later, WPBC-FM became WRAH and programmed an automated album oriented rock format. When the oldies format of WYOO started to slide in the ratings, more MOR music was added, but ratings slid even further. Fairchild contemplated selling the station. The general manager and program director, both hired from established Top 40 station KDWB, felt a major change needed to be made. =\\"Super U100\\"= The decision was made to change to a Top 40/hard rock format, in contrast to what they saw as the rigid, bland presentation of other similar stations in town. They kept the WYOO call letters, to avoid the hassle and long process of changing call letters with the FCC. After being rebuffed in their planned use of \\"Y100\\" as the station's moniker, the new station was christened \\"U100\\". An interesting note was the placement on the dial. The AM broadcast at 980, and the FM at 101.3. Management reasoned that back then, all radios were analog, and it seemed like the only number shown on that part of the dial was a big \\"100\\", so it was close enough to 980 and 101.3, close enough to \\"100\\" as far as they were concerned. The dial position was promoted similarly by WPBC, as \\"near 10 or 100 on AM or FM\\". The changeover occurred on August 26, 1974 during a remote broadcast from the Minnesota State Fair. The new U100 quickly became the topic of conversation throughout the area with its rowdy, outrageous mix of Top 40 and hard rock. During the next two years, U100 quickly became the most talked-about radio station in town. Competition was fierce in rock 40 radio at the time, and compared to U100, WDGY, KDWB and KSTP seemed a bit tame in their on-air presentation. As an added advantage, U100 was the first Twin Cities top 40 station to broadcast on the FM dial in stereo (in addition to 980 AM). =WAYL and the Entercom years= In early 1976, Fairchild Industries decided to put both stations on the market. The owner of easy listening (beautiful music) station WAYL was interested in the AM operation, to simulcast WAYL's signal and expand coverage in parts of the metro area. Since one company could not own more than one AM or more than one FM station in the same market at the time, they needed to find a buyer for the FM station, and sought out the owners of various AM stations in the area. Doubleday Broadcasting, owner of KDWB, wasn't actively seeking an FM station at the time but offered to buy 101.3 FM in February 1976 after they were offered a rather generous deal for $750,000 that included WYOO-FM and the building in Eagan that housed both stations. WAYL logo as it appeared in 1989 U100 signed off for the last time at midnight on Wednesday, September 15, 1976. The following Monday, 980 AM came back on the air as WAYL. WAYL (whose mascot was a whale) simulcast easy listening music on both 93.7 FM and 980 AM until 1982, when they briefly switched the AM station to lite rock, first as KKSS, and then to adult standards as KMFY in 1984. The AM station's somewhat eclectic format was unsuccessful and it returned to simulcasting WAYL by 1988. By this time, the two stations were owned by a larger company, Entertainment Communications, later known as Entercom. =From easy listening to hard rock= As the mid-1980s approached, the easy listening format was fading rapidly in popularity. While it had long been a strong ratings draw across the country, advertisers began to shun the older demographics of its listeners. In July 1988, WAYL-FM finally dropped easy listening and switched to classic hits as KLXK. WAYL's call letters and format remained on 980 AM, before completely giving up on beautiful music and switching to a simulcast of the FM station. In December 1990, the AM station branched off from its FM sister. The station picked up the full-time syndicated network called \\"Z-Rock,\\" following their departure from KZOW (950 AM). The new call letters became KMZZ and the music full-time hard rock and heavy metal. As the Z-Rock network itself later shifted to a more mainstream rock presentation, KMZZ dropped them on January 1, 1993 and began programming an in-house automated hard rock format as \\"Mega Rock\\". Mega Rock did not last long, and the following May, 980 AM returned to simulcasting their FM sister station, now active rock KRXX (93X). When Entercom sold 93X to Capital Cities/ABC in 1994, the AM station was not part of the deal. As a buyer was being sought, 980 was still owned by Entercom (though programmed by local ABC station KQRS-FM through a local marketing agreement) and continued to simulcast 93.7 FM until a buyer could be found. Upon taking control of KRXX in February, ABC immediately changed the format of KRXX-FM to modern rock as KEGE (\\"The Edge\\"). AM 980's call letters would remain KRXX until finally picking up the KEGE call letters later that year. =Sale to Salem= After more than two years on the market, the AM station was finally sold in December 1996 to current owner Salem Communications, and adopted a Christian preaching format. The call letters switched to the current KKMS on December 6, 1996. Today, Salem, which programs both Christian and secular formats, is one of the biggest radio station owners in the industry, and they currently own two other AM stations in the Twin Cities market. All three stations are based at the same Eagan studios that housed 980 AM and its broadcast facilities through its many incarnations. On January 18, 2015, KKMS rebranded as \\"The Mission.\\" Mission Accomplished for Salem's WMCA & KKMS See also *KDWB *WAYL *WYOO (U100) Previous logo 200px ReferencesExternal links *KKMS official website *Right on Super U!

This ethnic group should not be confused with the earlier Dí 狄, which refers to unrelated nomadic peoples in northern China during the earlier Zhou dynasty.

Political history During the Jin dynasty, the five semi-nomadic tribes of Xiongnu, Jie, Xianbei, Di, and Qiang conquered northern China. Historians call this period and the polities they created the Sixteen Kingdoms. During this era, the Di ruled the states of Cheng Han (304–347), Former Qin (351–394) and Later Liang (386–403). The tribe of Di was originally from the southern part of Gansu Province. Its leader, Fu Jian, founded Former Qin (351–394) and established his capital in Chang'an. He appointed Wang Meng, a Han-Chinese, as his prime minister. Cheng Han was a highly Sinicized administration. Its army was composed of Han- Chinese infantry and Di cavalry. In 370 AD, Fu Jian conquered Former Yan (307–370) and in 376, Former Liang (345–376), uniting northern China under Former Qin. He then embarked upon a plan to conquer the southern Eastern Jin Dynasty (317–420). In 383 AD, Fu Jian led a large army south with the intention of destroying Eastern Jin. He met the Jin's main forces at the Fei River in Anhui. The Jin Army had a smaller 80,000 strong army under the command of Xie Shi (謝石) and Xie Xuan. At the Battle of Fei River, Fu Jian observed that the Jin Army was well disciplined and stood in a rigid formation. Xie Shi and Xie Xuan saw Fu Jian's army was not ready for battle. Fu Jian's forces were an army of aggregated soldiers from many tribes in the north who were reluctant to fight his war. A messenger from the Jin side was sent across the river to see Fu Jian and requested him to pull his army back for a few kilometers so that the Jin Army could cross the river to fight the decisive battle. Fu Jian had great confidence in defeating the Jin Army due to superior numbers and he planned to attack the Jin troops when they were half way across the river. Fu Jian agreed and ordered his army to pull back. As soon as Fu Jian's order was issued convulsions spread across in his army. Some of the troops thought that they had been defeated by the Jin Army. Many of them shouted in panic, \\"The Qin Army are defeated. Run for your lives\\". Thousands of them threw down their weapons and ran for their lives. The panic developed into a stampede. Seeing that the Qin Army were running, Xie Shi led a force of 10,000 men and crossed the river to make a surprise attack on Fu Jian's camps. The Qin Army fled northward. Thousands of the Qin soldiers were trampled to death in the stampede. Fu Jian's campaign to conquer the south ended in disaster and his empire fell apart. He retreated to Chang'an, left his son Fu Pi (符丕) in charge of the capital, and returned to his home in southern Gansu to find new recruits among his own Di people. While on his way, Fu Jian was captured by soldiers of the hostile Later Qin (384–417) and was hanged by its ruler. His son, Fu Pi, became a new ruler of Former Qin. In 394 Former Qin was conquered by the Later Qin. The Former Qin lasted 44 years. Culture The Di lived in areas of present-day Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Shaanxi. They were culturally related to the Qiang, but farmed in the river valleys and lived in wood frame homes with mud walls.(Chinese) 段渝, 先秦巴蜀地区百濮和氐羌的来源 2006-11-30四川三星堆之謎新解：平武發現\\"縱目人\\"後裔?-搜狐IT汉晋时期藏彝走廊中的“氐” They might be related to the Geji (戈基) people in Qiang people stories.“羌戈大战”与岷江上游古羌人的族群认同 During the 4th and early 5th centuries, they established Former Qin and Later Liang states of that era's Sixteen Kingdoms.

In Western culture, hatpins are almost solely used by women and are often worn in a pair. They are typically around in length, with the pinhead being the most decorated part. Production The hatpin was invented to hold wimples and veils in place, and was handmade. In Britain, demand eventually outgrew the number that could be supplied by hand-making, and they began to be imported from France. In 1832 a machine was invented in America which could mass-produce the pins, and they became much more affordable. During the 1880s, bonnets gave way to hats, and the popularity of hatpins soared. They remained a standard women's accessory through the 1910s and were produced in a vast range of materials and types. Hatpin holder boxes were also produced. Use in self-defense and as a weapon Hatpins were sometimes used by women to defend themselves against assault by men. Laws were passed in 1908 in America that limited the length of hatpins, as there was a concern they might be used by suffragettes as weapons. Also by the 1910s, ordinances were passed requiring hatpin tips to be covered so as not to injure people accidentally. Various covers were made, but poorer women often had to make do with ersatz items like potato pieces and cork. In January 1918, the Norwegian newspaper Morgenbladet reported that police in Kristiania advised that passengers with uncovered hatpins be told to leave the trams. No law however had been passed against boarding a tram with uncovered hatpins. The tram staff had also stopped selling hatpin covers on board the trams, as regulations on the subject appeared so confusing that the staff preferred not to interfere.Reprinted in Morgenbladet, January 12 2018 Collectibles Hatpins are collectible items, and there is an American Hatpin Society for collectors in the United States and The Hat Pin Society of Great Britain for collectors in the United Kingdom.

It was published in the United States by Berkley Books, an imprint of Penguin Group, on August 2, 2005. The novel is based on Salazar's own experiences as an American in the French Foreign Legion. In 2016, Salazar released the revised and expanded edition of the book through Thistle Publishing UK. In 2019, the highly anticipated 3rd edition audio-book edition was released on Audible, iTunes and Amazon. Plot 2016 2nd edition cover of Legion of the Lost, by Jaime Salazar. Said version was revised and rewritten by the author. It tells the story of Jaime, a bored and self-described corporate cog. In a quest to seek solace from his corporate existence, he joined the French Foreign Legion, reputed to be the world's toughest army. He experiences brutality, adventure, and an uncompromising camaraderie. This is the story of his life in the \\"Army of Strangers\\". In a defunct 2008 Note addition on the book's website, Salazar disavowed his reckless weekend behavior, notably that with women, into the context of a typical young man's military life. He claims not to condone such libertine, amorous behavior then or now. Some book characters were morphed from multiple people. Salazar admits to describing a few incidents that were actually second-hand accounts. He claims artistic license was taken for purposes of clarity and succinctness. In 2019, Salazar released the revised third edition. It was scrubbed for errors and clarity. Additional details, as well as a more spiritual air, were included. A new book cover including the author's likeness was also created. Legionnaire Woodman, one of the memorable characters in the book, was a thinly fictionalized version of a young US Army veteran. Notable as a heavily tattooed, hard-drinking brawler in Salazar's book, Woodman went on to return to the US military, where he served as a sniper who survived five combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. He later left the military to pursue an academic career, studying philosophy, logic and computer science at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Maryland. As of April 2017, Salazar is working with former legionnaire, Alex de Bruyn, co-writing Escaping the Amazon, a memoir of his time serving in the elite jungle regiment, the 3e REI.

The plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82, registration HK-4374X, was en route from Tocumen International Airport (PTY) in Panama City, Panama, to Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport (FDF) in Fort-de-France, Martinique, France. While flying at , the aircraft's speed gradually decreased until it entered an aerodynamic stall. The crew, probably under the mistaken belief that the aircraft had suffered a double engine flame-out, did not take the necessary actions to recover from the stall. The confusion and lack of action resulted in the crash. All the passengers were French citizens from Martinique, with the exception of one Italian, acting as the tour operator. The crew was Colombian. The flight was chartered by the Globe Trotters de Rivière Salée travel agency in Martinique. Most of the passengers were tourists returning from a week's vacation in Panama. The 160-person death toll made the accident the deadliest of 2005, the deadliest aviation disaster to occur in Venezuela, and the deadliest involving a McDonnell Douglas MD-82. Background The flight's intended route and the crash site's location Medellín-based West Caribbean Airways started as a charter service in 1998. It specialized in flights to San Andrés in the Caribbean, parts of the Colombian mainland, and Central America. A few months before the accident, the airline had been fined $46,000 for lack of pilot training and failure to log required flight data. The aircraft involved in the incident was delivered to Continental Airlines on 4 November 1986 as N72824, which operated it until around 2001. At this point, the airframe was put into storage in the California desert for four years, and eventually purchased by MK Aviation, a United States-based company. On 10 January 2005, the aircraft was transferred to West Caribbean Airways, and registered as HK-4374X, leased to WCA by MK Aviation. The captain of flight 708 was 40-year-old Omar Ospina, and the first officer was 21-year-old David Muñoz. The captain had 5,942 hours of flight experience (including 1,128 hours on the MD-82), and the first officer 1,341 hours, with 862 of them on the MD-82. Accident Flight 708 took off from Tocumen International Airport at 00:58 local time (05:58 UTC). It climbed initially to flight level (FL) 310, and subsequently to FL 330. The aircraft reached FL 330 (nominally ) at 06:44. Five minutes later, the crew turned the aircraft's anti-icing systems back on (having turned them off during the final part of the climb). The system uses bleed air from the engines, and this reduces the thrust they can produce. With the anti-ice system on, the highest altitude at which the aircraft could maintain level flight was reduced to . The aircraft was being flown too high for its weight and the icing conditions it faced. The captain noticed the reduction in engine output, but he did not realize the source of the problem, so he started a rapid descent as a precaution. At that time, the airspeed was already near stall speed, and the autopilot had already compensated with a nose-up attitude (angle of attack, or AOA) of 5.8° in an effort to maintain a constant height. West Caribbean, like all owners of the MD-82, had received an operation bulletin from the planes' manufacturer three years earlier, warning that the autopilot could try to compensate for inadequate speed, even allowing the speed to continue to drop towards a stall situation, without sending a warning or disconnecting; the bulletin advised pilots to simply monitor airspeed during autopilot level flight, but West Caribbean had not shared this bulletin with its pilots. Already approaching a stall condition, the airliner was pummeled by sudden turbulence, reducing the airflow into the intakes of the engines, which reduced thrust even more. The flow of air over the wing of the aircraft became stalled. Although the cockpit voice recorder picked up the first officer correctly diagnosing the situation as a stall and attempting twice to communicate this to the captain, the captain was likely confused by the unusual behavior of the engines, due to the anti-ice system and probably the airflow disruption caused by turbulence. The captain thought he was struggling with an engine flameout, which he told the first officer to communicate to the ground controller, and did not recognize the stall situation; he then mishandled the stall by increasing the nose-up attitude to an AOA of 10.6°, which compounded the drop in airflow to the engines and further exacerbated the stall. In less than three minutes, the aircraft plunged from over 33,000 feet, reaching a maximum rate of descent of over , crashing belly-first and exploding at 07:01 UTC. The crash site was in a field on a cattle ranch near Machiques, in the western Zulia State, Venezuela (about from the Colombian border). Timeline All times are UTC.

Investigation The Comité de Investigación de Accidentes Aéreos (CIAA, Aircraft Accidents Research Committee) of Venezuela led the investigation into the causes of the accident. The French Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile was assigned the main responsibility for investigative analysis of the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), with the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) also taking part in recovery of FDR data. On 22 November 2005, the CIAA released an initial report (significantly changed by the time of the final report) suggesting that a buildup of ice inside each engine's PT2 probe was partly responsible for the accident. Analysis of the CVR showed that the crew discussed weather conditions, including icing, and continually requested and performed descents, which is the usual response to a low power or low airspeed situation. Analysis of the debris showed that both engines were rotating at normal speed at the time of impact, which enabled investigators to conclude that the engines had not been previously damaged, and were functioning at the time of impact. Ground scars showed that the aircraft impacted in a nose-high attitude. The CIAA, which by then had been renamed the Junta Investigadora de Accidentes de Aviación Civil (JIAAC, Civil Aviation Accidents Investigation Board), released their final report into the accident and found the probable underlying causes of the crash to be the result of pilot error. Underscoring the finding listing pilot error as a cause, the JIAAC noted a lack of both situational awareness and crew resource management (CRM), which would have better enabled the crew to properly respond to the stall and the severity of the emergency. The report stressed that the crew failed to operate the aircraft within its normal parameters. This resulted in the crew failing to recover from the stall due to poor decision-making and poor communication between the pilots. In addition, West Caribbean Airways came under criticism: West Caribbean failed to provide its pilots with the operation bulletin from McDonnell Douglas, specifically addressing the autopilot issue; failed to emphasize CRM in ongoing pilot training; created stress for its pilots by not providing regular paychecks for a period of nearly six months leading up to the accident; and further created stress for the accident crew when the airplane was delayed and almost refused takeoff at their previous stop due to West Caribbean's non-payment of catering and food service fees.  Aftermath  As a result of the crash, West Caribbean Airways was grounded by the CAEAC just one day after the crash occurred. The airline subsequently went bankrupt in October 2005. Media and popular cultureDramatization= The hourlong Discovery Channel Canada TV series Mayday (other titles in other countries) featured the crash and investigation in a season-11 episode titled \\"The Plane That Flew Too High\\". The episode title references the fact that the cruising altitude of 33,000 feet was too high for the aircraft's weight in the weather conditions it faced. In 2010, the documentary Panamá-Fort-de-France : autopsie d'un crash, [Panamá-Fort-de-France: autopsy of a crash] (in French) by Stéphane Gabet and Luc David, traces the event, as well as the investigation. A short film, Crossing Away, produced for the 10th anniversary of the Martinique-Panama plane crash, was not released until 2017. =In music= * \\"On n'oublie pas\\" [Don't Forget], (tribute to the 152 Martinique victims), 2014, written by Serge Bilé, sung by several artists and personalities including Jocelyne Beroard, Alpha Blondy, Harry Roselmack and Admiral T, to remember this event and to help the AVCA, the association of the victims of the air disaster, to raise funds.

The London Missionary Society was a predominantly Congregationalist missionary society formed in England in 1795 at the instigation of Welsh Congregationalist minister Dr Edward Williams working with evangelical Anglicans and various nonconformists. It was largely Reformed in outlook, with Congregational missions in Oceania, Africa, and the Americas, although there were also Presbyterians (notable for their work in China), Methodists, Baptists and various other Protestants involved. It now forms part of the Council for World Mission (CWM). Origins In 1793, Edward Williams, then minister at Carr's Lane, Birmingham, wrote a letter to the churches of the Midlands, expressing the need for world evangelization and foreign missions.Wadsworth KW, Yorkshire United Independent College -Two Hundred Years of Training for Christian Ministry by the Congregational Churches of Yorkshire Independent Press, London, 1954 It was effective and Williams began to play an active part in the plans for a missionary society. He left Birmingham in 1795, becoming pastor at Masbrough, Rotherham, and tutor of the newly formed Masbrough academy.The LMS and the academy at Masbrough both date from the year 1795. Also in 1793, the Anglican cleric John Eyre of Hackney founded the Evangelical Magazine. He had the support of the presbyterian John Love, and congregationalists Edward Parsons and John Townshend (1757–1826). Proposals for the Missionary Society began in 1794 after a Baptist minister, John Ryland, received word from William Carey, the pioneer British Baptist missionary who had recently moved to Calcutta, about the need to spread Christianity. Carey suggested that Ryland join forces with others along the non-denominational lines of the Anti-Slavery Society to design a society that could prevail against the difficulties that evangelicals often faced when spreading the Word. This aimed to overcome the difficulties that establishment of overseas missions had faced. It had frequently proved hard to raise the finance because evangelicals belonged to many denominations and churches; all too often their missions would only reach a small group of people and be hard to sustain. Edward Williams continued his involvement and, in July 1796, gave the charge to the first missionaries sent out by the Society.Morison, John Fathers and Founders of the London Missionary Society - a Jubilee Memorial pages 427-443 chapter titled Memoir of the Late Edward Williams London: Fisher 1844. This publication may be viewed online at https://archive.org/stream/fathersfounderslmso00mori#page426/mode/2up The society aimed to create a forum where evangelicals could work together, give overseas missions financial support and co-ordination. It also advocated against opponents who wanted unrestricted commercial and military relations with native peoples throughout the world. After Ryland showed Carey's letter to Henry Overton Wills, an anti-slavery campaigner in Bristol, he quickly gained support. Scottish ministers in the London area, David Bogue and James Steven, as well as other evangelicals such as John Hey, joined forces to organize a new society. Bogue wrote an influential appeal in the Evangelical Magazine for September 1794: John Eyre responded by inviting a leading and influential evangelical, Rev. Thomas Haweis, to write a response to Bogue's appeal. The Cornishman sided firmly with Bogue, and immediately identified two donors, one of £500, and one of £100. From this start, a campaign developed to raise money for the proposed society, and its first meeting was organised at Baker's Coffee House on Change Alley in the City of London. Eighteen supporters showed up and helped agree the aims of the proposed missionary society – to spread the knowledge of Christ among heathen and other unenlightened nations. By Christmas over thirty men were committed to forming the society. In the following year, 1795, Spa Fields Chapel was approached for permission to preach a sermon to the various ministers and others by now keenly associated with the plan to send missionaries abroad. This was organised for Tuesday 22 September 1795, the host chapel insisting that no collection for the proposed society must be made during the founding event which would be more solemn, and formally mark the origin of the Missionary Society. Hundreds of evangelicals attended, and the newly launched society quickly began receiving letters of financial support, and interest from prospective missionaries. Early days Joseph Hardcastle of Hatcham House, Deptford became the first Treasurer, and the Rev. John Eyre of Hackney (editor of the Evangelical Magazine ) became the first Secretary to the Missionary Society—the latter appointment providing it with an effective 'newspaper' to promote its cause. The Missionary Society's board quickly began interviewing prospective candidates. In 1800 the society placed missionaries with the Rev. David Bogue of Gosport for preparation for their ministries. Matavai in the island of Tahiti to Captain James Wilson for the use of the missionaries. A Captain James Wilson offered to sail the missionaries to their destination unpaid. The society was able to afford the small ship Duff, of 267 tons (bm). It could carry 18 crew members and 30 missionaries. Seven months after the crew left port from the Woolwich docks in late 1796 they arrived in Tahiti, where seventeen missionaries departed. The missionaries were then instructed to become friendly with the natives, build a mission house for sleeping and worship, and learn the native language. The missionaries faced unforeseen problems. The natives had firearms and were anxious to gain possessions from the crew. The Tahitians also had faced difficulties with diseases spread from the crews of ships that had previously docked there. The natives saw this as retribution from the gods, and they were very suspicious of the crew. Of the seventeen missionaries that arrived in Tahiti, eight soon left on the first British ship to arrive in Tahiti. When Duff returned to Britain it was immediately sent back to Tahiti with thirty more missionaries. Unfortunately this journey was disastrous. A French privateer captured Duff, landed its prisoners in Montevideo, and sold her. The expense of the journey cost 'The Missionary Society' ten thousand pounds, which was initially devastating to the society. Gradually it recovered, however, and in 1807 was able to establish a mission in Guangzhou (Canton), China under Robert Morrison. Another missionary who served in China was John Kenneth Mackenzie. A native of Yarmouth in England, he served in Hankow and Tientsin. Starting in 1815, they hired Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir as a translator, to work on many texts including the gospels. After attending Homerton College, then in Hampstead, William Ellis (missionary) was ordained in 1815. Soon atter his marriage to Mary Mercy Moor on 9 November 1815 they were posted to the South Sea Islands returning in 1824. He later become Chief Foreign Secretary. In September 1816 Robert Moffat (1795–1883) was commissioned in the Surrey Chapel, on the same day as John Williams. Moffat served in South Africa until 1870. Mary Moffat joined him and they married in 1819. The LMS only employed male missionaries and it preferred them to be married. The Moffats were to have several children who also became and/or married missionaries. In 1817 Edward Stallybrass was sent out to Russia to start a mission among the Buryat people of Siberia. The mission received the blessing of Alexander I of Russia, but was suppressed in 1840 under his successor Nicholas I. Alongside Stallybrass worked of Sweden, William Swan and Robert Yuille of Scotland. Later work and notable missionaries London Missionary Society, Sāmoa (1949) In 1818, the society was renamed The London Missionary Society. In 1822, John Philip was appointed superintendent of the London Missionary Society stations in South Africa where he fought for the rights of the indigenous people. 1823 - John Williams discovered the island of Aitutaki, in Rarotonga. It is here that the missionary work was first established. In later years John Williams visited Rarotonga, taking with him two Tahitians he picked up from Tahiti. One of the Tahitians, named Papehia, was used as intermediaries to convince local chiefs to join the new gospel. 1830 – John Williams sighted the coast of Savai'i in Samoa and landed on August 24, 1830 at Sapapali'i village in search of Malietoa Vai‘inupo, a paramount chief of Samoa. John Williams was greeted by his brother Taimalelagi. Upon meeting Malietoa at a large gathering in Sapapali'i, the LMS mission was accepted and grew rapidly throughout the Samoan Islands. The eastern end of the Samoan archipelago, was the kingdom of Manu'a. The paramount chief, Tui-Manu'a embraced Christianity and Manu'a also became a LMS island kingdom. 1832 – John Williams landed at Leone Bay in what was later to become American Samoa. (Tala faasolopito o le Ekalesia Samoa) He was informed that men of their village have accepted the 'lotu' brought by an Ioane Viliamu in Savai'i; not knowing John Williams now stood before them. A monument stands before the large Siona Chapel – now CCCAS in Leone, American Samoa – in honor of John Williams. In 1839 John Williams's missionary work whilst visiting the New Hebrides came to an abrupt end, when he was killed and eaten by cannibals on the island of Erromango whilst he was preaching to them. He was traveling at the time in the Missionary ship Camden commanded by Captain Robert Clark Morgan (1798-1864). A memorial stone was erected on the island of Rarotonga in 1839 and is still there today. His widow is buried with their son, Samuel Tamatoa Williams, at the old Cedar Circle in London's Abney Park Cemetery, the name of her husband and the record of his death described first on the stone. John Williams' remains were sought by a group from Samoa and his bones were brought back to Samoa, where throngs of the LMS mission attended a funeral service attended by Samoan royalty, high-ranking chiefs and the LMS missionaries. His remains were interred at the native LMS church in Apia. A monument stands in his memory across from the Congregational Christian Church of Apia chapel. Rev. Alexander MacDonald and his wife Selina Dorcas (née Blomfield) arrived in Rarotonga in May 1836, then Samoa in April 1837 and settled at Safune on the central north coast of Savai'i island in [Samoa in August 1837. He left the LMS in 1850 when he accepted a position with the Congregational church in Auckland, New Zealand. 1839–1879 – Reverend George Pratt served as a missionary in Samoa for many years, at the station at Matautu on Savai'i island. Pratt was a linguist and authored the first grammar and dictionary on the Samoan language, first published in 1862 at the Samoa Mission Press. In 1840 the medical missionary and explorer David Livingstone (1813-1873) departed for South Africa, arriving in 1841, and serving with the LMS until 1857. Moffat and Livingstone met circa 1841. In 1845 Livingstone married Robert and Mary Moffat's daughter Mary (1821-1862). 1844 – London Missionary Society established Malua Theological College at the village of Malua on Upolu to educate local men to become village clergy for the rapidly growing mission with over 250 villages and 25,000 membership. 1844 – London Missionary Society sent Samoan missionaries to surrounding islands; Rotuma, Niue, Tokelau, Ellice Islands, Papua, Vanuatu. Over 300 served in Papua alone. The society soon sent missionaries all over the world, notably to India, China, Australia, Madagascar and Africa.

Merger The London Missionary Society merged with the Commonwealth Missionary Society (formerly the Colonial Missionary Society) in 1966 to form the Congregational Council for World Mission (CCWM). At the formation of the United Reformed Church in 1972 it underwent another name change, becoming the Council for World Mission (Congregational and Reformed). The CWM (Congregational and Reformed) was again restructured in 1977 to create a more internationalist and global body, the Council for World Mission.

It is one of the highest areas in the city, on high ground southeast of the city centre. To the west the area is bounded by the Midland Main Line, to the south by London Road (A6), and to the east by East Park Road. To the north is Spinney Hills, though there is no clear boundary between the two areas, and Spinney Hills (which extends northwards to Humberstone Road) is often considered to be part of Highfields. The neighbourhood is within walking distance of the city centre of Leicester and offers many amenities for religious, social, cultural and commercial activities. The population is split between the Spinney Hills, Wycliffe and Stoneygate wards of the Leicester City Council. The area was developed between the late 19th century and the start of the First World War, and contains many fine Victorian townhouses (now usually subdivided into flats), as well as areas of redbrick terraced housing. There are modern council estates and tower blocks to the east of Leicester railway station, built during the 1970s on the site of cleared slums, but for the most part the area consists of privately owned and rented property, with some housing association properties. Many of the area's properties are rented by students of the nearby University of Leicester. The city's workhouse, later Hillcrest Hospital, was formerly situated in the area, on the site now occupied by Moat Community College . A section of the area running between London Road, Evington Road and St Peter's Road was designated as the South Highfields Conservation Area in April 1981. This conservation area originally had an area of approximately 22.20 hectares. The boundaries of the conservation area were reassessed in 2003, and it was reduced to approximately 20.55 hectares. As with many inner-city areas in the United Kingdom, Highfields and its residents have often suffered from economic and other forms of social disadvantage. For this reason, Highfields has in the past been an area associated with crime—it was known even prior to the Second World War as the city's red light district. However this is no longer the case. Although the area still suffers from many social problems, in recent years some of the establishments associated with criminal activity have been closed. Police activity within the area, often supported by local residents' groups, has led to a number of drug busts. Ethnic mix For many years, Highfields has been an extremely multicultural area, with a large ethnic minority, and rapidly evolving population, traditionally being an area occupied by recent immigrants to the city, as well as students from the nearby University of Leicester. The area has played host to numerous waves of migration to Leicester and subsequent generations, notably including Indian, Jewish, Irish, Polish, Somali, Pakistani, and Caribbean populations, who have contributed significantly to the area's character and rich cultural diversity. Recently the area has seen a large growth in immigrants from Eastern Europe. Highfields contains Leicester's synagogue, an African-Caribbean Centre, various Christian churches and many mosques, madrassas and Islamic community centres. The annual Leicester Caribbean Carnival traditionally parades through Highfields to the city centre and back again, terminating at nearby Victoria Park. After funding and logistical difficulties causing the event to be cancelled in 2006, the Carnival was reinstated to Leicester's cultural calendar. Amenities Highfields is bounded by London Road and Evington Road meaning that it has a large amount of amenities on its doorstep. Notably this includes the railway station, many Mosques (the biggest includes a leisure centre within its grounds), Churches, Temples, a modern health centre, nurseries, schools, local shops, restaurants, community centres and banks. The area also has a public library which is located on Melbourne Road. Highfield Street is particularly notable for having a high concentration of restaurants in a relatively small area. =Community centres and groups= The area is also notable for having a large number of well developed community institutions which represent the whole community and sections of it. * African Caribbean Centre * Leicester Community Radio (1449 AM) is based at the African Caribbean Centre and is committed to providing a significant number of hours per week of programming dedicated for the Afro-Caribbean Community * Highfields Association of Residents and Tenants (HART) is pledged to improve the area of Highfields and holds regular meetings to organise and represent the area's residents. * Highfields Youth and Community Centre: opened in 1974 as a community centre, to enable the Highfields Community Association (HCA) to provide social and recreational activities for local residents. Over the years, the Centre's work has developed and progressed to offering a full range of lifelong and community development services.Highfields Youth and Community Centre, The Centre was modernised in 2004, and houses facilities where functions, occasions and events take place. After local government budget cuts in 2010, Leicester City Council handed over running of the centre to HCA, with an underlying business plan to enable the centre to become \\"self-sustaining\\", enabled by a grant initially of £293,000pa. Ever since, HCA have been embroiled in a disagreement with the city council. In July 2015, elected Mayor of Leicester Peter Soulsby signed an agreement to end funding to HCA in March 2016 due to a number of reasons, including lack of a business plan and the centre being \\"significantly under-used\\". * Melbourne Centre on Melbourne Road which was formerly a Polish school. The front of this building was redeveloped for use as a health centre in the early 2000s while the rear of the building is quite run down in parts and in use by a number of organisations and businesses such as ACCF and Olies Caribbean Kitchen. * Muslim Khatri Association (MKA) was established in 1982 as the UK Khatri Welfare Centre. Early work consisted mainly of translation, interpretation, funerals, social gatherings and marriage counselling. However, due to the changing needs of the community, the Centre has evolved to its present form with 2 workers. The MKA works to empower the South Asian communities and local residents to confront some of the problems they may experience including unemployment, poor housing in inner city areas, racial abuse and cultural alienation with a particular focus on the needs of women and children. * South Highfields Neighbours * St Peter's Neighbourhood Management Board engaged support of residents and service providers to address neighbourhood issues in health, employment, education, as well as housing and Leicester City Council neighbourhood management problems. In making pioneering use of the internet by publishing high resolution photo slideshows and videos of neighbourhood issues such as littering, criminal damage and flytipping they attracted a small degree of criticism but overall widespread general support for their methods. In particular for its decision to broadcast residents' own video footage of anti- social behaviour (litter louts, louts vandalising a parked car and a graffiti vandal) over the internet on their website in order to highlight the issues, to identify those involved or / and create a deterrent effect. * St Peter's Community Centre =Schools= The area has a number of schools including:- * Medway Community Primary School * Uplands * Sparkenhoe * Highfields * Shenton * Charnwood * Moat Community College * Bridge School * Sacred Heart RC School Policing The area is policed by the Leicestershire Constabulary.

HistoryNineteenth century= In the early nineteenth century, Highfields was a rural area lying outside of the city of Leicester. \\"Known as High Fields, the area was rich in water sources and windmills\\". Highfields Remembered This area of farm land was reached by short lanes that led off of London Road. The layout and width of Mill Hill Lane still survives much in the form that it took in the 1820s, although the housing was not built until the 1850s. Prebend Street and Saxby Street also formed two of these lanes that led from London Road to farms although both of these roads have been widened since. South Highfields Conservation Area Character Statement (March 2003) , p. 4. The 1820s saw the beginnings of the development of the area as a residential district. First to be developed were Glebe Street, Conduit Street and Prebend Street and No 20 Glebe Street remains as one of the oldest surviving houses in the area. By this time there were already a few large villas on the London Road (e.g. 78-82). The Collegiate School on College Street was built in 1835.South Highfields Conservation Area Character Statement (March 2003) , p. 4. The first terraced houses were built in Lincoln Street, Hobart Street and Seymour Street in the 1860s. By the 1870s, although much of the area east of London Road was still open fields, a large house (Highfields House) had been built and the area between Highfield Street and Mill Hill Lane had been developed (Maps 3 and 4). Houses facing London Road were mainly built between the mid-1850s and the late 1860s and most still remain, although all have been converted to commercial uses. St Peter's Church, St Peter's Road Substantial houses continued to be built as the area expanded southwards until the 1880s. Several streets were named after Prince Albert, the Prince Consort’s family, but were renamed during the 1st World War; Saxe Coburg (now Saxby) Street was built between 1872 and 1881, Gotha (now Gotham) Street between 1877 and 1887 and Mecklenburg (now Severn) Street between 1875 and 1888. Places of worship were also built to cater for the growing population. In 1874 St Peter's Anglican Church was consecrated on St Peter's Road opposite the end of Highfields Street. The building was designed by the renowned architect George Edmund Street who was also responsible for the Courts of Justice in London. The Society of Friends opened a Meeting House at the corner of Glebe Street and Prebend Street in 1876 and, by 1886, several more places of worship had been built - a Congregational Chapel on London Road, a Wesleyan Church and Sunday school on the corner of Saxby Street and Sparkenhoe Street and the Victoria Road Baptist (now Seventh Day Adventist) Church and Sunday school at the corner of London Road and Victoria (now University) Road.South Highfields Conservation Area Character Statement (March 2003) , p.4. By the 1880s, land prices were high and small residential enclaves such as Woodbine and Gordon Avenues were built in 1884 with only footpath access to make the maximum profitable use of the land. This also occurred between Prebend Street and College Street, creating College Avenue in 1886 and Brookhouse Avenue in 1888 and between Gotham Street and London Road, creating Victoria Avenue (1889), on part of the site of an earlier large villa and garden (‘The Chestnuts’). These pedestrian enclaves give the area a unique feel. However, the development of Stoneygate began to attract the middle classes away from Highfields and demand for larger houses declined. Development was completed by the construction of smaller terraced houses on Churchill, Connaught and Hamilton Streets (1886–1888).South Highfields Conservation Area Character Statement (March 2003) , p. 5. In 1898, the respected local architect Arthur Wakerley designed the Highfield Street synagogue. This place of worship served a newly established Jewish community that was beginning to settle in the area. =Twentieth century= Since completion of the Victorian suburb, there has been no wholesale redevelopment of the area and so much of it still looks as it would have done in the nineteenth century. The main changes have been the loss of front gardens on the west side of London Road (and most of those on the east side) for highway use and the wholesale conversion of buildings on both sides of London Road into shops and offices. , p.5. 1920s and 1930s The 1920s and 1930s saw some continued development and redevelopment in the area. Offices and businesses were built on Nelson Street, whilst new shops and offices were built on London Road (55-57) in the Art-deco style in 1935. Most of the original houses between Conduit Street and Prebend Street, including the Congregational chapel, gave way to 3 and 4 storey offices and showrooms between the 1930s and 1960s. Further along London Road, Nos. 132 to 140 were replaced by offices with a large setback from the street frontage to accommodate road-widening which never took place. Before and during the Second World War, the Jewish community expanded, with evacuees and refugees from Europe; a Polish and Latvian community began to be established. Second World War The area was badly bombed during the Second World War. The worst night of bombing took place on 19 November 1940, with high-explosive bombs and incendiaries falling across the area between the Old Horse and the city centre. This night is often referred to as Leicester's Blitz. Several buildings at the corner of Highfield Street and Tichborne Street were destroyed and 41 people killed at this site (now occupied by Trinity Life Church in a community hall and ex-garage). On the same night a number of bombs fell on Sparkenhoe Street destroying homes, the local Post Office and the Methodist Church on the corner of Saxby Street and killing two people. Fragments of the bomb which destroyed the Methodist Church also damaged St Peter's Church, passing through the West window, bouncing several times before becoming embedded in the high altar.\\"Leicestershire in World War II\\", Leicester Chronicler, http://www.leicesterchronicler.com/war.htm This was the city's largest of at least 8 recorded enemy raids between September 1940 - July 1942, where 122 people died in total and 284 recorded as seriously injured.\\"Bird's Eye Wartime Leicestershire 1939-1945\\", Cartwright, T.C., 2002, p.16 Among those killed on that night were 12 members of the Royal Army Pay Corps who were billeted in the area. It is recorded that one of the Luftwaffe's largest of bombs was dropped on Grove Road (the 1000 kg Parachute Mine), causing extensive damage to adjacent streets.\\"Bird's Eye Wartime Leicester\\", Cartwright, T.C., 1998, p.6 It is still possible to trace the paths of the bombs by looking at the areas of post-1950s building that have gone on in the area. More recently, some infill development has taken place, such as De Montfort Mews behind 5 to 19 De Montfort Street, Andrew Court and Tichborne Court flats (late 1970s) and the bank at 121 to 123 London Road (1973/4). In 1999, a bank was built to replace a 1960s office block on the corner of Saxby Street and London Road. Post-War Highfields After the war the area became less desirable as the trend towards suburban living encouraged many residents to move out to the outskirts of the city. The area became characterised by lodging houses and poor quality rented accommodation and this attracted a succession of migrants to make their homes in the area. In the post-war period these incomers were largely Irish migrants.Nick Jewson, Syd Jeffers and Virinder Kalra, Family Care, Respite Services and Asian Communities in Leicester (Leicestershire Health Authority and Leicestershire Social Services: 2003), http://www.le.ac.uk/so/respitecare/report.pdf, p.12. The post-war period also saw the migration of ex-servicemen and workers from the Caribbean to the area. The post-war period also saw the first South Asian migrants moving to the area. This first wave of South Asian migrants who came directly were Punjabi and Gujarati in response to the demand for unskilled labour during the post war economic boom. Most of these migrants were men from rural areas where unemployment levels were high. Upon arrival in Leicester they formed a tight-knit community and in order to maximise their ability to save, these groups established lodging houses in the Highfields area of Leicester.Nash and Reeder (1993) 1970s During the early 1970s and especially after 1972, a large number of the Asian community in East Africa began to move to the area following expulsion from Uganda by Idi Amin. This group migrated in large numbers over a relatively short period of time and it quickly became apparent that Highfields was not going to be able to accommodate the entire East African Asian population. These immigrants differed from the earlier direct migrants from Gujarat and the Punjab who had settled in Leicester. Perhaps the most important difference was that many of them were refugees and involuntary migrants. In addition to their strong trading, business and professional backgrounds and good knowledge of English, the Asians settled in East Africa tended to arrive as complete families, including ageing parents and relatives.Clarke et al. 1990 As a result, their housing needs and aspirations differed significantly from those predominately single migrants from other countries.O’Connor 1995, p.18 And some were able to bring some, if not all of their savings. This ensured that these new migrants were quickly in a position to purchase much of the available housing in the Highfields area. However, Highfields did not have sufficient capacity and the Asians arriving from East Africa became centred in Belgrave. 1980s On 10 July 1981 a riot broke out in the area as part of a wave of riots that were sweeping the country.\\"A different reality\\", Warwick Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations, These riots had a range of causes but to some extent were a protest about perceived discrimination and acute disadvantage. Lord Scarman found the riots that took place across the country to be communal disorders with a racial dimension.Michael Banton, Promoting Racial Harmony (Cambridge:1985), p.91.

Retrieved 2008-09-04 Although it can be used in many contexts and among different age groups, relational aggression among adolescents in particular, has received a lot of attention. The attention relational aggression has received has been augmented by the help of popular media, including movies like Mean Girls and books like Odd Girl Out by Rachel Simmons (2002), Nesthäkchen and the World War by Else Ury (1916), and Queen Bees and Wannabes by R. Wiseman (2003). Relational aggression can have various lifelong consequences. Relational aggression has been primarily observed and studied among girls, following pioneering research by psychologist Nicki R. Crick.  Overview  A person's peers become increasingly significant in adolescence and are especially important for adolescents' healthy psychological development. Peers provide many new behavioral models and feedback that are essential for successful identity formation and for the development of one's sense of self.Brown, B. (2004) Adolescents' relationships with peers. In R. Lerner and L. Steinberg (Eds.), Handbook of adolescent psychology. New York: Wiley. Interactions with peers encourage positive practice of autonomy and independent decision-making skills.Hill, J. & Holmbeck, G. (1986) Attachment and autonomy during adolescence. In G. Whitehurst (Ed.), Annals of child development. Greenwich, CT: JAI Press They are also essential for healthy sexual development including the development of the capacity for intimate friendships and learning appropriate sexual behavior.Sullivan, H. S. (1953a) The interpersonal theory of psychiatry. New York: Norton. Peer relationships are also very important for determining how much adolescents value school, how much effort they put into it, and how well they perform in class.Epstein, J. (1983b) The influence of friends on achievement and affective outcomes. In J. Epstein & N. Karweit (Eds.), Friends in school. New York: Academic Press. However, quite frequently adolescents take part in peer relationships that are harmful for their psychological development. Adolescents tend to form various cliques and belong to different crowds based on their activity interests, music and clothing preferences, as well as their cultural or ethnic background.Brown, B., & Mounts, N. (1989, April). Peer groups structures in single versus multiethnic high schools. Paper presented at the biennial meetings of the Society for Research on Adolescence, San Diego Such groups differ in their sociometric or popularity status, which often create unhealthy, aggression-victimization based dynamics between groups. Different forms of aggression can also be used to control dynamics and sociometric status within a group. Sometimes aggression is directed to an individual rather than to any apparent social group. Primary reasons for victimization include looks and speech; adolescents are also frequently bullied because of a disability, particular ethnicity, or religion. = Definition = Relational aggression is defined as a type of aggression that is \\"intended to harm others through deliberate manipulation of their social standing and relationships\\". Relational aggression, according to Daniel OlweusOlweus, D. (1991). Bully/victim problems among schoolchildren: Basic facts and effects of a school based intervention program. In D. J. Pepler & K. H. Rubin (Eds.), The development and treatment of childhood aggression (pp. 441-448). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum is a type of bullying. Bullying in general, is defined as physically or psychologically violent re-occurring and not provoked acts, where the bully and victim have unequal physical strength or psychological power.Olweus, D. (1999). Sweden. In P. K. Smith, Y. Morita, J. Junger-Tas, D. Olweus, R. Catalano, & P.Slee (Eds.), The nature of school bullying: A cross- national perspective (pp. 7-27). New York:Routledge. These key conditions apply to all types of bullying: verbal, physical and relational.  Types  Relational aggression may be either covert or direct, and is distinct from other forms of indirect aggression. It can be proactive (planned and goal- oriented) or reactive (in response to perceived threats, hostility, or anger), and it can be, for instance, peer-directed or romantic. Several studies have indicated substantive differences between proactive and reactive relational aggression. Reactive aggression is associated with a tendency to assume that others' intentions are hostile (hostile attribution bias). Most studies of relational aggression have involved children or adolescents; the study of relational aggression in adults presents problems. Relational aggression is a common aspect of workplace bullying, and is a characteristic behaviour of psychopaths in the workplace, so it is commonplace amongst adults as well as children.  Manifestations  Manifestations of relational aggression include:Steinberg, L. (2008). Adolescence, 8th ed. 101. New York, NY: McGraw- Hill * Excluding others from social activities. * Damaging victim's reputations with others by spreading rumors and gossiping about the victim, or humiliating them in front of others. * Withdrawing attention and friendship. Psychological manipulation and coercion can also be considered as a type of relational aggression. Most recent research has been focusing on cyberbullying, which is a relatively new yet increasingly popular way of engaging in both verbal and relational aggression due to growing importance of various communication and technology devices in modern societies.http://www.cyberbullying.org/ Some studies show that internet meanness is more common among girls than boys.  Prevalence  Many studies in the U.S. and Europe show that at least 30% of students report having been bullied in one or another way. Some studies indicate even higher percentages of victimization. Bullying in schools happens in all forms and at various ages, although peer bullying has the highest prevalence in 6th–8th grades. The most common forms of bullying are verbal with relational, or various forms of ostracism, coming in second.Valeckiene, D. (2005). Priekabiavimo kaip vienos dazniausiai naudojamos agresijos formos mokykloje raiSkos analiz (The analysis of bullying as one of the most prevalent form of aggression at schools). Sveikatos ir socialiniu mokslu taikomieji tyrimai: sandura ir saveika, 1, 49-65 = Gender differences = Although it can be used by both genders, relational aggression is more commonly associated with girls. Findings of a study by Rivers and Smith have shown that while verbal aggression occurs with similar frequency in both sexes, direct physical aggression is more common among boys and indirect aggression is more common among girls. In another study by Baldry it was found that boys are more likely to engage in bullying behaviors such as threats, physical harm, rejection, and name-calling, while girls are most likely to use name-calling, teasing, rumors, rejection, and taking personal belongings. Based on these findings, girls do seem to use relational aggression more than boys. In addition, recent international research shows that both genders tend to use relational aggression, but girls are more aware and distressed by it. For example, a study by Horn found that girls are more likely to say that it is morally wrong to exclude someone based on their crowd membership. Some research shows that there are certain implications when boys and girls engage in gender-atypical aggression, as girls who are more physically aggressive or boys who are highly relationally aggressive are more maladjusted than their peers.  Sociometric status  Sociometric status, commonly referred as popularity, is one of the most significant predictors of victimization or bullying as differences in popularity can be associated with differences in social power. It is commonly believed that aggressive adolescents belong to rejected social groups. However, some research shows that they can be popular among their peers. Rodkin et al. (2000), for example, describes two types of popular boys: \\"model\\" boys, who are \\"physically and academically competent, friendly and neither shy nor aggressive.\\" Second type is described as \\"tough\\" and such adolescents are \\"aggressive, physically competent, and average or below average in friendliness, academic competence, and shyness.\\" Usually the more popular aggressive adolescents use instrumental aggression and not reactive aggression. Instrumental aggression is defined as behavior that is deliberate and planned while reactive aggression is unplanned and impulsive. Relational aggression can be greatly instrumental for maintaining the popularity status of a group among other groups, as well specific relationship and status dynamics inside a group. Ojala and Nesdale (2004) found that both victims and bullies normally come from rejected groups. Bullies chose to bully students, who are members of their social out-groups that are similar to their own in- group as a result of threatened distinctiveness. Hence, the need to maintain a unique social identity and status can be one of the causes to engage in bullying. Using relational aggression to maintain a particular social order inside the group has been mostly observed in girl groups: if some member of the group becomes too popular and this causes imbalance in the group, other members might start rumors about the overly popular girl to diminish her status. Amanda Rose (2004) claims that the main purpose of using relational aggression in first place is to enhance or maintain one's social status. Many skills that are needed to be popular are also essential for being \\"successful\\" at employing relational aggression, e.g. ability to \\"read\\" people and adjust one's behavior accordingly, etc. The researcher suggests that some aggressive boys are popular because they are also good at using relational aggression, and, therefore, their primary reason for popularity is not their physical but relational aggression.  Different participation roles  Research shows that there are three types of rejected or unpopular adolescents who are very likely to be involved in bullying behavior. First type includes adolescents who are overly aggressive: they tend to get into fights, get involved in antisocial activities, and are often involved in bullying; second type includes adolescents who are withdrawn or timid and exceedingly shy and inhibited and who are more likely to be victims; third aggressive-withdrawn-type adolescents tend to have trouble controlling their hostility, but they are also very shy and nervous about initiating friendships. The latter are likely to be bully- victims. Other students- bystanders can also choose between several roles: victim-defender, bully-reinforcer or assistant, and outsiders. = Victims = Victims or the unpopular withdrawn children are excessively anxious, lack social skills needed to initiate new contacts or break into a group activity.Rubin, K., LeMare, L., & Lollis, S. (1990). Social withdrawal in childhood: Developmental pathways to peer rejection. In S. Asher & J. Coie (Eds.), Peer rejection in childhood, pp. 217-249. New York: Cambridge University Press. Their lack of confidence combined with submissiveness make them perfect targets for bullying.Olweus, D., (2003) Victimization by peers: Antecedents and long-term outcomes. In K. Rubin & J. Asendorf (Eds.), Social withdrawal, inhibition, and shyness in childhood. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum Some of the most common underlying reasons for bullying include low socioeconomic status, disability, and obesity. Research shows that in comparison with other adolescents victims often use worse problem solving strategies. They often score less than their bullies and defenders in the tests of moral competence and theory of mind. Moral competence refers to the ability to carefully consider both the consequences and prior beliefs in determining how morally right or wrong one's actions are. Victims seemed to focus primarily on the outcomes and not being as good in integrating the moral beliefs. They have difficulties in social skills, and social problem solving, as well as emotional regulation. And because of their lack of social competence, victims score low on peer acceptance and popularity. Victims are often overly sensitive to being rejected, which might originate in their relationships with parents. = Bullies = Bullies, despite being quite morally competent, tend to engage in morally wrong behaviors because of several reasons, including a lack of moral compassion. In general, bullies seem to engage in a kind of cold cognition and have a good theory of mind. They also have an average to good social intelligence. These skills seem to be especially important in order to use relational aggression in an instrumental manner—for achieving specific social goals. As mentioned previously, male and female bullies usually score differently on sociometric measures. Male bullies often fall in the socially rejected category while female bullies tend to fall in the controversial category. They can be popular yet not liked.  Hostile attributional bias  Many unpopular aggressive kids seem to engage in hostile attributional bias when analyzing the actions of others: they are more likely to interpret other children's behavior as hostile while it is not, which can cause the perpetuation of their aggressive behaviors. = Bully-victims = Bully- victims are people who have both experienced aggression directed towards them and have themselves engaged in bullying. They often choose to be bully assistants or reinforcers. Seeing others victimized can serve as a buffer against some psychological problems, for which these people are at risk (see consequences of victimization below). In comparison to all other groups, bully-victims are the worst off regarding their psychological adjustment and problems. They are least liked among the peers. = Bystanders = Although early research has mostly focused on victims and bullies, currently more and more attention has been given to the roles of other students, or bystanders: bully-reinforcer's and assistants, victim-defenders, and outsiders.  Bully-reinforcers and assistants  Bully-reinforcers and assistants do not normally initiate aggressive actions themselves, but they support, reinforce, and assist the bully. They often have rather large friendship networks when compared to outsiders, victims, and their defenders. These individuals are similar to bullies in regards of their personal characteristics. Female bully- reinforcers and assistants usually score low on social acceptance and high on rejection by their peers while male bully assistants have average scores on both and bully-reinforcers are often quite popular among their peers. The characteristic that is common among all these individuals across both genders is low level of empathy.  Victim-defenders  Victim-defenders are individuals who stand up for the victim. They are usually popular among their peers, although occasionally rejected and victimized adolescents take on the defender's role. Defenders like to befriend other defenders and usually belong to the smallest social network of all other previously mentioned groups. Defenders have both advanced moral competence and high level of compassion. They also score high on the theory of mind tests. They are usually very morally engaged, have a high sense of responsibility, and self-efficacy. They are also good at emotion regulation.Maede, 2004  Outsiders  Outsiders are adolescents who like to stay away from the conflict situations, participate in spreading rumors, or actively support either side. They usually befriend other outsiders. Both male and female outsiders usually score below average on both social acceptance and rejection by their peers. In general, the best predictor for whether an adolescent will choose to be a defender or an outsider in a particular situation is their relationship to the victim or bully. Occasionally, adolescents will feel more comfortable to intervene if they are friends of the offender. However, in general they will take the side of the bully or victim based on who they know better. Bullies are more likely to be friends of other bullies, as well as their reinforcers, and assistants, while victims befriend other victims.  Consequences of victimization  There are serious negative consequences associated with being involved in any aggressive behaviors. And while problems with peers might be a result of one's poor social skills and maladjustment, difficulty making friends, and regular experience of aggression can also be a cause of many short and long term negative consequences on one's mental health and academic and professional achievements.Buhrmester, D., &Yin;, J., (1997) A longitudinal study of friends' influence on adolescent's adjustment. Paper presented at biennial meetings of Society for Research in Child Development, Washington, DC. Experience of relational aggression, peer rejection, and unpopularity are shown to be linked to various problems in adolescence, which are listed below: * depression; * behavior problems; * poor social skills; * lack of close peer relationships; * difficulties in academic performance; * low school engagement; * undermined feelings of competence; * low self-esteem; * occasionally distress due to victimization can also result in physical symptoms such as wetting, abdominal pain, and headaches. Some negative effects persist into adulthood. In a longitudinal study, Dan Olweus (2003) found that young adults, who were victims of bullying in adolescence, had more symptoms of depression and lower self-esteem than did their non-victimized peers. Victims are also much more likely to engage in heavy smoking later in life. Decreased academic engagement due to victimization can have some long term consequences as victim's lower educational attainment in adulthood leads to lower earnings. = Differences in consequences of victimization for victims and bully-victims = There are differences in consequences among the children who are rejected and aggressive, also known as bully-victims, and children who are rejected and withdrawn, also referred to as simply victims. Aggressive individuals often have conduct problems and are involved in antisocial activity. Withdrawn children feel exceedingly lonely, at risk of low self- esteem, depression, and diminished social competence. Adolescents, who are both aggressive and withdrawn, are at greatest risk for various mental and behavioral problems.Rubin, K., LeMare, L., & Lollis, S. (1990). Social withdrawal in childhood: Developmental pathways to peer rejection. In S. Asher & J. Coie (Eds.), Peer rejection in childhood, pp. 217-249. New York: Cambridge University Press. = Suicide ideation and attempts = Although victims respond to bullying in various ways, some of the most common ways include avoidance or escape behaviors, such as not going to school and running away from home. However, in some extreme cases, suicide attempts might occur. Compared to non-victims, victims exhibit increased levels of suicidal ideation. and are more likely to have attempted suicide.Eisenberg, M. E., Neumark-Sztainer, D., & Story, M. (2003). Associations of weight-based teasing and emotional well-being among adolescents. Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, Î51, 733-738.Kim, Y. S., Koh, Y. J., & Leventhal, B. (2005). School bullying and suicidal risk in Korean middle school students. Pediatrics, IIS, .Í57-363. Researcher Y.S. Kim (2005) found that there are some gender differences as victimized female but not male students were at significantly greater risk for suicidal ideation. Further research has shown that increased risk for suicidal ideation and attempts depend on a specific interaction between gender, frequency, and type of aggression. Relational or indirect aggression was found to be associated with depression and suicidal ideation among both genders. According to Brustein and Klomek (2007), victimization at any frequency increased the risk of depression, ideation, and attempts among girls, while only frequent victimization increased the risk of depression and ideation among males; yet, Katliala-Heino et al. (1999) found that severe ideation was associated with frequent victimization only among girls.  Environmental buffers and prevention programs  Some adolescents are more resilient to victimization due to their personal characteristics, but there are some environmental factors such as having a best friend or great family support can decrease the risk for many negative consequences associated with victimization. In addition, research shows that support from teachers can be a significant environmental factor for higher academic achievement and school engagement. It can also increase general well-being in the classroom. Teacher attitudes towards bullying were found to moderate the extent to which victims internalize and feel distressed and express it by avoiding school and similar behavior. Close teacher-student relationship moderates perceived safety in the classroom, and higher perceived safety is directly linked to better classroom concentration and improved coping strategies. Therefore, supportive friends, family, and teachers can be great buffers for victimized students against all negative effects of victimization. Witnessing the harassment of others can also reduce some harmful effects of being victimized: victims-only feel more humiliated and angry than victims-witnesses on the same day. Being singled out and picked on feels worse than being one of many victimized students. This explains why in ethnically diverse schools victimized students experience worse psychological outcomes when their ethnic group is in majority, because then they are more likely to attribute it to their personal shortcomings and not to their group membership. = Prevention programs = There are many prevention programs, which have been designed to improve social skills of the unpopular and victimized adolescents. Prevention programs usually focus on one of the three strategies: # teaching social skills like self-expression, leadership, and questioning of others about themselves;Kelley, J., & de Armaa, A. (1989). Social relationships in adolescence: Skill development and training. In J. Worell & F. Danner (Eds.), The adolescent as decision-maker. San Diego: Academic Press.Repinski, D., & Leffert, N. (1994, February). Adolescents' relations with friends: The effects of a psychoeducational intervention. Paper presented in the biennial meetings of the Society for Research on Adolescence, San Diego. # have unpopular adolescents participate in group activities together with the popular adolescents under supervision of psychologists; # some programs focus on training on how to combine and use one's cognitive and behavioral abilities, including social problem solving.Kusche, C. A. & Greenberg, M. T. (1994, 2011, 2012). The PATHS Curriculum. South Deerfield, MA: Channing-Bete Co. Different types of programs have shown to have somewhat different effects: the first type seems to best improve adolescent's ability to get along with others while the second type has shown to improve adolescents' self-conceptions and their acceptance by others. One of the examples of the programs using the third approach is PATHS (Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies) teaches skills needed for successfully analyzing social situations, controlling one's negative emotions, and making more rational social decisions. It has been shown to successfully reduce behavioral problems among elementary school children. However, it is difficult to prevent relational aggression from happening as often adolescents who use it are seen to be more popular among their peers.

He was educated at the progressive independent Dartington Hall School in England and completed a BA degree in Politics and Government at the University of Kent in 1980, followed by an MSc at the London School of Economics (1981) and a PhD in Sociology at Kent, (1986). He was formerly a Visiting Research Fellow in the Department of Political Science at the New School for Social Research in New York City, Adjunct Professor in the Department of Political Science at Columbia University and a Visiting Research Fellow in the School of Politics, Queen's University Belfast. Publications include articles in African Affairs, Ethnic and Racial Studies, Peace and Change, The Political Quarterly, Race and Class, The Round Table, and TELOS. He was editor of Politikon and Voluntas: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations. Rupert Taylor is a \\"B\\" rated National Research Foundation scholar and many of his publications can be accessed at https://independent.academia.edu/RupertTaylor Early career As a Masters student at the London School of Economics Taylor achieved the highest distinction grade for the degree. His doctoral dissertation highlighted the problems confronting Queen's University Belfast in trying to maintain a liberal position in a deeply divided society and helped initiate the reform of sectarian employment practices in higher education in Northern Ireland. In 1984 his research findings were reported in the British and Irish media, and stimulated a Fair Employment Agency enquiry that resulted in new employment equity guidelines. Taylor's doctoral research was acknowledged in John Whyte's Interpreting Northern Ireland (Oxford University Press, 1990). Consociationalism Taylor's research interests include political violence, transitions to democracy and non-governmental organisations. He has written widely about South African politics and the Northern Ireland conflict. He has been critical of consociationalism as a strategy of conflict management. Whilst at the New School for Research in New York (1993–94), Taylor developed a deeper critique of the way in which political science has dealt with race and ethnicity (expounded in the Ethnic and Racial Studies award-winning paper). This led him to propose a social transformation theory as a compelling way to bring about democratic peace in societies marked by racial and ethnic division – see his \\"Northern Ireland: Consociation or Social Transformation\\" chapter in John McGarry's Northern Ireland and the Divided World (Oxford University Press, 2001). Taylor's position on consociationalism is widely acknowledged in the political science literature on the Northern Ireland conflict and the South African transition from apartheid to democracy, a position consolidated with the recent publication of the edited volume on Consociational Theory (Routledge, 2009). Taylor participated in a two-year international study of peace and conflict organisations in Northern Ireland, Israel/Palestine and South Africa. This study was conducted in collaboration with the International Society for Third Sector Research (ISTR), involved academics from Princeton University, Ben Gurion University, Tel Aviv University, University of Ulster and Bethlehem University, and was presented at the ISTR conference in Geneva in 1998. This led to the publication of Gidron, Katz, and Hasenfeld (eds), Mobilizing for Peace (Oxford University Press, 2002). Taylor authored the chapter on South Africa. This book won the Virginia Hodgkinson Independent Sector research prize (2003). South Africa Taylor's peer-reviewed papers on the causes of political violence in South Africa have been referred to in many international publications. One such paper, published in African Affairs (2002), examines the structural nature of post-apartheid political violence in KwaZulu-Natal. Another is the earlier Race and Class paper (1991) on township political violence. In The Politics of Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa (Cambridge University Press, 2001), Wilson wrote that “Rupert Taylor came up with sophisticated theories of apartheid violence.” Taylor wrote a number of papers on non-racialism in South Africa, and along with Orkin wrote a substantial chapter on the racialisation of social scientific research on South Africa that attracted a scholarly response in the South African Sociological Review. Taylor has published two well-cited papers with Habib (Vice-Chancellor of Wits University) on opposition politics and the state of the South African nonprofit sector. Editor of Voluntas In 2000 Taylor was appointed editor of the ISTR journal Voluntas: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations. As editor, he took the journal to Springer, a new major international publisher. As a result of Taylor's editorial direction the global academic visibility of Voluntas dramatically increased. It is now an ISA-rated journal and the leading journal focusing on the scholarly study of the third sector. Taylor served as editor until 2009 and compiled an edited volume on Third Sector Research (Springer, 2010). Dismissal from Wits University Taylor was placed on special leave by Wits University in 2013 following allegations of sexual harassment, which he disputed, and was subsequently dismissed from his position.

History Founded in the early 1990s in Oxford, England, the Egg released its first EP Shopping (1995) on the independent record label, Cup of Tea Records. Having been signed by China Records, in 1996 the band released the album Albumen in the United States on Discovery Records in 1997. In 1998, the follow-up album, Travelator, was released, produced by Tim Holmes of Death in Vegas. In 2000, the group recorded the theme tune to the Yorkshire Television show, At Home with the Braithwaites. Following Travelator, the Egg began exploring the new directions. Following their Mellowmania EP in 2002, they were signed by Bar de Lune Records, a subsidiary of Beechwood Music. Beechwood folded the following year just before a return with their new album, Forwards, (produced by Benji Vaughan) and subsequently released on Squarepeg Records in 2004. The single \\"Walking Away\\" (featuring Sophie Barker of Zero 7) was released in 2005, and further remixes commissioned by licensees. This became a crossover hit, and spawned the bootleg by David Guetta, \\"Love Don't Let Me Go (Walking Away)\\", to reach #3 in the UK Singles Chart in August 2006. In 2006, the Egg played at The Big Chill, Bestival, Glastonbury, and other venues across Europe. The following year saw more UK music festivals appearances. In 2007 the band toured Australia and Brazil for the first time playing most major cities in each. In 2008 the Egg contributed the song \\"Trails and Tribulations\\" to the Songs for Survival Survival International charity album, and later in the year they played at Camp Bisco 7 in New York City. They also toured the U.S. extensively in 2008, 2009, and 2010.

Life He was born at Newton Grange, Oswaldkirk, near Helmsley, Yorkshire, in the house of his maternal grandfather, Ralph Sandwith. He devoted himself early to antiquarian research, in which he was greatly assisted by the fact that his father, Matthew Dodsworth, was registrar of York Minster, and could give him access to the records preserved there. He married Holcroft Hesketh, the widow of Laurence Rawsthorne of Hutton Grange, Penwortham, Lancashire where he subsequently resided until his death in August 1654. Works At various times in his life he was able to study the records in the library of Sir Robert Cotton, in Skipton Castle and in the Tower of London. He collected a vast store of materials for a history of Yorkshire, a Monasticon Anglicanum, and an English baronage. The second of these was published with considerable additions by Sir William Dugdale (2 vols., 1655 and 1661). The manuscripts were left to Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron, who by his will bequeathed them (160 volumes in all) to the Bodleian Library at Oxford. Portions have been printed by the Yorkshire Archaeological Society (Dodsworth's Yorkshire Notes, 1884) and the Chetham Society (copies of Lancashire postmortem inquisitions, 1875–1876). Dodsworth was aided in his study of early Yorkshire by Thomas Levett, a native of High Melton, Yorkshire and High Sheriff of Rutland, who came into possession of the Chartulary of St. John of Pontefract, a collection of early Yorkshire documents kept by monks at the Cluniac abbey. In 1626–27 Levett gave the documents to Dodsworth. How Levett came to possess them is unknown, but the Levetts had been prominent in Yorkshire for centuries, and had once controlled Roche Abbey.

There are two main approaches to comparative sociology: some seek similarity across different countries and cultures whereas others seek variance. For example, structural Marxists have attempted to use comparative methods to discover the general processes that underlie apparently different social orderings in different societies. The danger of this approach is that the different social contexts are overlooked in the search for supposed universal structures. One sociologist who employed comparative methods to understand variance was Max Weber, whose studies attempted to show how differences between cultures explained the different social orderings that had emerged (see for example The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism and Sociology of religion). There is some debate within sociology regarding whether the label of 'comparative' is suitable. Emile Durkheim argued in The Rules of Sociological Method (1895) that all sociological research was in fact comparative since social phenomenon are always held to be typical, representative or unique, all of which imply some sort of comparison. In this sense, all sociological analysis is comparative and it has been suggested that what is normally referred to as comparative research, may be more appropriately called cross-national research.

In European pottery of the 17th to 19th centuries this was at certain times and places a significant part of production, and the decoration could be of very high quality. Hausmalerei began with freelance enamelers on glass in Bohemia but developed in Germany on white tin-glazed earthenware in the 17th century, when glazed and fired but unpainted wares \\"in the white\\" were purchased on speculation by unsupervised freelance ateliers of china painters, who decorated them in overglaze enamel colours and gilding, which were fixed by further firing in their own kilns. A few such freelance decorators of faience operated in Nuremberg in the late 17th century,John Fleming and Hugh Honour, Dictionary of the Decorative Arts (1977)s.v. \\"Hausmaler\\". but hausmalerei developed in Augsburg into a notable feature of tin-glazed earthenware production during the early 18th century, before the workshops turned entirely to porcelain. Hausmalerei reached a artistic pinnacle with paintings on Meissen porcelain and Vienna porcelain in the second quarter of the 18th century; sometimes Meissen porcelains remained blank for decades before they were painted.M tray, ca 1730, with hausmalerei of ca 1750. Many painters and workshops have distinctive styles; a few were amateurs.Battie, David, ed., Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain, pp. 93-94, 1990, Conran Octopus. In France, the production of Sèvres porcelain was tightly controlled, so that painting was under strict factory control. By contrast, Limoges porcelain has always maintained a strong tradition of atelier decoration, whether near Limoges or at Paris. In England, among independent porcelain-painters of the mid-18th century, William Duesbury went on to manufacture porcelain as a founder of the Royal Crown Derby and owner of manufactories at Bow, Chelsea, Derby and Longton Hall. In England, America and elsewhere, china painting became a popular hobby or semi-professional pastime in the mid-19th century, normally for ladies, and many factories sold blanks. The 204-piece Canadian Historical Dinner Service of 1897 represents a peak of this trend, with 16 female artists, most from middle-class backgrounds, taking part in decorating the service. Traditions of hausmalerei were never wholly extinguished. The founder of Heinrich & Co began as a hausmaler, purchasing porcelain blanks until he set up his own kilns ca 1903. From 1930 the Czech hausmaler Josef Kuba (1896-1972) maintained an atelier in Karlsbad, Czech Republic, and later in Wiesau, Bavaria. supplied by various porcelain manufacturers in Bavaria.Porcelain Marks & More: Wiesau After the disturbances of the Russian Revolution many pre-revolutionary blanks of the Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg were painted by artists as long as ten years later, in bold new Constructivist styles; such pieces are now highly sought-after.example in the British Museum, blank from 1912, painted 1922 Chinese Canton porcelain of the 18th and 19th centuries used a similar system, but on a larger scale. The blanks were Jingdezhen porcelain which was carried the considerable distance to Guangzhou before being decorated.

According to the Turin Canon of Kings, he ruled over the northern portion of Egypt for forty years.Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988, p.189. He ruled during the early half of the 16th century BC and outlived his southern rival, Kamose, but not Ahmose I.Grimal, p.189 Although his reign only entailed northern Egypt, Apepi was dominant over most of Egypt during the early portion of his reign, and traded peacefully with the native Theban Seventeenth dynasty to the south. While he might have exerted suzerainty over Upper Egypt during the beginning of his reign, the seventeenth dynasty eventually assumed control over this region, and the Hyksos were driven out of Egypt no more than fifteen years after his death.Grimal, p.194 Kamose, the last king of the Theban 17th Dynasty, refers to Apepi as a \\"Chieftain of Retjenu\\" in a stela that implies a Canaanite background for this Hyksos king. Praenomina Neb-khepesh-Re ('), A-qenen-Re (') and A-user-Re (') are three praenomina or throne names used by this same ruler during various parts of his reign.Apophis: Titulary While some Egyptologists once believed that there were two separate kings who bore the name Apepi, namely Auserre Apepi and Aqenenre Apepi, it is now recognized that Khamudi succeeded Apepi I at Avaris and that there was only one king named Apepi or Apophis.Kim Ryholt, The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c.1800-1550 B.C.\\" by Museum Tuscalanum Press. 1997. p.125Kings of the Second Intermediate Period University College London; scroll down to the 15th dynasty Nebkhepeshre or \\"Re is the Lord of Strength\\" was Apepi's first prenomen; towards the middle of his reign, this Hyksos ruler adopted a new prenomen, Aqenenre, which translates as \\"The strength of Re is great.\\"Apophis:Titulary In the final decade or so of his reign, Apepi chose Auserre as his last prenomen. While the prenomen was altered, there is no difference in the translation of both Aqenenre and Auserre. His Horus name Shetep-tawy is attested only twice (once together with A-qenen-Re).

Inscriptions: \\"The perfect god, the lord of the two lands, Nebkhepeshre Apepi\\" and \\"Follower of his lord Nehemen\\", found at a burial at Saqqara. Now at the Luxor Museum. Rather than building his own monuments, Apepi generally usurped the monuments of previous pharaohs by inscribing his own name over two sphinxes of Amenemhat II and two statues of Imyremeshaw.Grimal, p.193 Apepi is thought to have usurped the throne of northern Egypt after the death of his predecessor, Khyan, since the latter had designated his son, Yanassi, to be his successor on the throne as a foreign ruler.Ryholt, p.256 He was succeeded by Khamudi, the last Hyksos ruler. Ahmose I, who drove out the Hyksos kings from Egypt, established the 18th Dynasty. In the Ramesside era, Apepi is recorded as worshiping Seth in a monolatric way: \\"[He] chose for his Lord the god Seth. He didn't worship any other deity in the whole land except Seth.\\" Jan Assmann argues that because the Ancient Egyptians could never conceive of a \\"lonely\\" god lacking personality, Seth the desert god, who was worshiped exclusively, represented a manifestation of evil.\\"Of God and Gods\\", Jan Assmann, p47-48, University of Wisconsin Press, 2008, There is some discussion in Egyptology concerning whether Apepi also ruled Upper Egypt. There are indeed several objects with the king's name most likely coming from Thebes and Upper Egypt. These include a dagger with the name of the king bought on the art market in Luxor. There is an axe of unknown provenance where the king is called beloved of Sobek, lord of Sumenu. Sumenu is nowadays identified with Mahamid Qibli, about 24 kilometers south of Thebes and there is a fragment of a stone vessel found in a Theban tomb. For all these objects it is arguable that they were traded to Upper Egypt.D. Polz: Die Hyksos-Blöcke aus Gebelên; zur Präsenz der Hyksos in Oberägypten, in: E. Czerny, I. Hein, H. Hunger, D. Melman, A. Schwab (editors): Timelines, Studies in Honour of Manfred Bietak, Leuven, Paris, dudley, MA , p. 244-245 More problematic is a block with the king's name found at Gebelein. The block had been taken as evidence for building activity of the king in Upper Egypt and, hence, seen as proof that the Hyksos also ruled in Upper Egypt. However, the block is not very big and many scholars argue today, that it might have reached Gebelein after the looting of the Hyksos capital and is no proof of a Hyksos reign in Upper Egypt.D.

Biography He was born in Żebrak, Siedlce County in 1787. After completing his education at the Lwów University, he entered the Polish Legion formed in the Duchy of Warsaw, as a common soldier and won his lieutenancy at the Battle of Raszyn in 1809. At the Battle of Leipzig he greatly distinguished himself and at Arcis-sur-Aube, in 1814, saved Napoleon from the sudden onslaught of the enemy by sheltering him in the midst of his battalion. On the formation of the Kingdom of Poland in 1815 Skrzynecki was put in command of five infantry regiments of the line, and on joining the insurrection of 1830 was entrusted with the organization of the Polish army. After the Battle of Grochow, he superseded Prince Michał Gedeon Radziwiłł as commander in chief; but avoided all decisive operations as he hoped for the pacific intervention of the European powers in favor of Poland. In the beginning of March 1831 he even entered into correspondence with the Russian Field-marshal Hans Karl von Diebitsch, who was taken very ill both at Paris and London. When, at last Skrzynecki had to take the offensive his opportunity was gone, and he committed more than one tactical blunder. In the battle of Ostrołęka (26 May 1831) he showed his usual valour and considerable ability, but after a bloody contest Diebitsch prevailed and Skrzynecki fell back upon Warsaw, where he demanded a reconstruction of the government and his own appointment as dictator. To this the Diet would not consent, though it gave Skrzynecki a vote of confidence. But public opinion was now running strongly against him and he was forced on 10 August, in his camp at Bolimów, to place his resignation in the hands of his successor, Henryk Dembiński. Skrzynecki thereupon joined a guerrilla corps and on 22 September took refuge in Austrian territory. Subsequently he resided at Prague, but migrated to Brussels where he was made commander in chief of the Belgian army, an appointment he was forced to resign by the combined and emphatic protest of Russia, Austria and Prussia, in 1839; however he rested there in active service until 1848. With the permission of the Austrian government he finally settled at Kraków, where he died in 1860. Polish historian, Jerzy Łojek, presumed that Skrzynecki was a traitor who baffled all the national efforts.Łojek, Jerzy (1986). Szanse powstania listopadowego. Warszawa: Instytut Wydawniczy PAX. pp. 69–79. Although Skrzynecki was remarkable for his personal courage (albeit some accused him of cowardice) and made an excellent general of division, he was unequal to the heavier responsibility of supreme command, and did much harm in that capacity by his irresolution. He wrote Two Victorious Days (Warsaw, 1831); and Mes erreurs (Paris, 1835).

In 1710, all of its inhabitants were relocated to the fortress of Dmitriyevsk () on the opposite bank of the river. In 1780, the name was changed to Kamyshin and it was granted town status. In the 19th century, Kamyshin turned into a merchant city with sawmills and windmills. It was formerly famous for its watermelon trade. =Portage between the Volga and Don Rivers= Kamyshin Historical Museum Near Kamyshin, the Volga is quite close——to the upper reaches of the Ilovlya River, the tributary of the Don. The distance between the sources of the Kamyshinka River, the tributary of the Volga, and the Ilovlya is only a little more than . In this place in ancient times there existed a portage (\\"volok\\") many times used by the troops invading the land of the Khazars, and moving from the Don basin to the Volga.

A metasystem is formed by the integration of a number of initially independent components, such as molecules (as theorized for instance by hypercycles), cells, or individuals, and the emergence of a system steering or controlling their interactions. As such, the collective of components becomes a new, goal-directed individual, capable of acting in a coordinated way. This metasystem is more complex, more intelligent, and more flexible in its actions than the initial component systems. Prime examples are the origin of life, the transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms, the emergence of eusociality or symbolic thought. The concept of metasystem transition was introduced by the cybernetician Valentin Turchin in his 1970 book The Phenomenon of Science, and developed among others by Francis Heylighen in the Principia Cybernetica Project. The related notion of evolutionary transition was proposed by the biologists John Maynard Smith and Eörs Szathmáry, in their 1995 book The Major Transitions in Evolution.Smith, J. M., & Szathmary, E. (1997). The Major Transitions in Evolution. Oxford University Press. Another related idea, that systems (\\"operators\\") evolve to become more complex by successive closures encapsulating components in a larger whole, is proposed in \\"the operator theory\\", developed by Gerard Jagers op Akkerhuis. Turchin has applied the concept of metasystem transition in the domain of computing, via the notion of metacompilation or supercompilation. A supercompiler is a compiler program that compiles its own code, thus increasing its own efficiency, producing a remarkable speedup in its execution.  Evolutionary quanta  The following is the classical sequence of metasystem transitions in the history of animal evolution according to Turchin, from the origin of animate life to sapient culture: # Control of Position = Motion: the animal or agent develops the ability to control its position in space # Control of Motion = Irritability: the movement of the agent is no longer given, but a reaction to elementary sensations or stimuli # Control of Irritability = Reflex: different elementary sensations and their resulting actions are integrated into a coordinated, but still rigid, reflex- like behavior # Control of Reflex = Association: behavioral routines become flexible or adaptive, through the learning of new associations between experienced stimuli and actions # Control of Association = Thought: new routines no longer need to be learned through experience; they can be developed by abstract, symbolic reasoning # Control of Thought = Culture: symbols and concepts are no longer fixed entities; they adapt through a process of cultural evolution  Contemporary perspectives  major evolutionary transitions in information processing Many argue that the next human metasystem transition consists of a merger of biological metasystems with technological metasystems, especially information processing technology. Several cumulative major transitions of evolution have transformed life through key innovations in information storage and replication, including RNA, DNA, multicellularity, and also language and culture as inter-human information processing systems. In this sense it can be argued that the carbon-based biosphere has generated a cognitive system (humans) capable of creating technology that will result in a comparable evolutionary transition. \\"Digital information has reached a similar magnitude to information in the biosphere... Like previous evolutionary transitions, the potential symbiosis between biological and digital information will reach a critical point where these codes could compete via natural selection. Alternatively, this fusion could create a higher-level superorganism employing a low-conflict division of labor in performing informational tasks... humans already embrace fusions of biology and technology. We spend most of our waking time communicating through digitally mediated channels, ...most transactions on the stock market are executed by automated trading algorithms, and our electric grids are in the hands of artificial intelligence. With one in three marriages in America beginning online, digital algorithms are also taking a role in human pair bonding and reproduction\\".

Life and work Mary Cutler was born in Dalton, Massachusetts. She attended Mount Holyoke College (then Mount Holyoke Female Seminary) and graduated in 1875. She later taught at the college from 1876 to 1878. In 1884, she was hired by Melvil Dewey, the librarian of Columbia College, as a cataloguer. When Dewey opened the first library school, Fairchild taught cataloging. She moved with it when the school moved to Albany. The school was reorganized and named the New York State Library School. She served as vice-director in addition to teaching. Because of Dewey's frequent absences she conducted much of the administration of the school. She served the school for 16 years. The University of the State of New York awarded Cutler a bachelor's degree in library science in 1891. In 1897, Fairchild married Edwin M. Fairchild, a Unitarian Minister. She pioneered library services for the blind and organized the New York State Library for the Blind in 1899 also serving there as a librarian. For the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, she chaired a committee that established a 5,000-volume library and created a catalog for it. She was active in the American Library Association serving as the ALA Executive Director in 1891. In 1905, she became ill and had to retire from the library for the blind and the school, but she continued to contribute to the field through articles she wrote and submitted to journals. Mary Salome Cutler Fairchild died December 20, 1921 in Takoma Park, Maryland. She has been inducted as a member of the Library Hall of Fame. Work on women in libraries In 1904, Cutler Fairchild was asked by the President of the American Library Association to prepare a statistical statement on “Women in American Libraries” which was published in the December 1904 issue of the Library Journal. She opened the article by showing the growing prominence of women in American libraries through comparison of three conferences of the American Library Association. “At the first meeting of the Association in Philadelphia, 1876, only 12 of the 103 members present were women; at the Chicago meeting in 1893, 166 of the 305 members present were women; at Magnolia in 1902, the largest conference yet held, 736 out of 1018 members present were women”. To further illustrate her opinion that there was no discrimination in regard to sex in the American Library Association, she refers to Miss Caroline M. Hewins, librarian of the Hartford Public Library, who was the first woman to ask a question before a meeting of the American Library Association in 1877, the association's second meeting, and Miss Mary A. Bean, the librarian of the Brookline Public Library, who was the first woman to appear on a library program, by reading a paper on “The evil of unlimited freedom in the use of juvenile fiction” in the 1879 meeting in Boston. Cutler Fairchild credits the open-minded attitude of the men in the library movement for contributing to the lack of self-consciousness displayed by women in association meetings by taking what women said or wrote at its actual value. However, she noted that participation by women in American Library Association meetings was disproportionate to their attendance. Cutler Fairchild continued her evaluation of women in libraries by surveying 100 representative libraries to access the number of professional and non- professional positions and their salaries held by women as compared to those held by men. The results of her inquiries proved that women greatly outnumbered men in the libraries selected, holding a large proportion of administrative positions but with little administrative responsibility, and outnumbered men in non-administrative responsible positions, but seldom held positions with the most responsibility. In addition, women did not hold positions offering the highest salaries, but rather appeared to perform the same level of work for less compensation. The following reasons were given for this discrepancy: #She [that is, women in general] has not the temperamental fitness for the exercise of large authoritative control over a mixed staff. #She is not in touch with the world of affairs. #She is distinctly unbusinesslike. #She shuns rather than courts responsibility. #She is conservative and afraid of legitimate experiments. #She lacks originality. #She lacks a sense of proportion and the power of taking a large, imperative view of things. Despite these criticisms of women's ability to hold responsible library positions, women continued to push men out of the library field, just as in the teaching field, because they could be paid less than men, as was legal at the time. Cutler Fairchild did find agreement among the criticizers that positions requiring “gracious hospitality” were held more successfully by women including the head of small or medium-sized libraries and all work with children. “‘Her broad sympathies, her quick wits, her intuitions and her delight in self-sacrifice’ give her an undoubted advantage.” ReferencesFurther reading * \\"Fairchild, Mary Salome Cutler.\\" American National Biography. 7:684-685. 1999. * \\"Fairchild, Mary Salome Cutler (1855-1821).\\" Dictionary of American Library Biography.

Conversely, it can be used to express any meromorphic function as a sum of partial fractions. It is sister to the Weierstrass factorization theorem, which asserts existence of holomorphic functions with prescribed zeros. It is named after Gösta Mittag- Leffler. Theorem Let D be an open set in \\\\mathbb C and E \\\\subset D a closed discrete subset. For each a in E, let p_a(z) be a polynomial in 1/(z-a). There is a meromorphic function f on D such that for each a \\\\in E, the function f(z)-p_a(z) has only a removable singularity at a. In particular, the principal part of f at a is p_a(z). One possible proof outline is as follows. If E is finite, it suffices to take f(z) = \\\\sum_{a \\\\in E} p_a(z). If E is not finite, consider the finite sum S_F(z) = \\\\sum_{a \\\\in F} p_a(z) where F is a finite subset of E. While the S_F(z) may not converge as F approaches E, one may subtract well-chosen rational functions with poles outside of D (provided by Runge's theorem) without changing the principal parts of the S_F(z) and in such a way that convergence is guaranteed. Example Suppose that we desire a meromorphic function with simple poles of residue 1 at all positive integers. With notation as above, letting :p_k = \\\\frac{1}{z-k} and E = \\\\mathbb{Z}^+, Mittag-Leffler's theorem asserts (non- constructively) the existence of a meromorphic function f with principal part p_k(z) at z=k for each positive integer k. This f has the desired properties. More constructively we can let :f(z) = z\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{k(z-k)} . This series converges normally on \\\\mathbb{C} (as can be shown using the M-test) to a meromorphic function with the desired properties.

Retrieved on 9 May 2016. In the 1960s, Leo Maggs was working at the Hazell Sun Group's design studio in Covent Garden, London. At that time, he was commanded to create a futuristic style title for an article of About the House (the magazine of The Friends of Covent Garden Opera House). Maggs based the letters of that title on the MICR (magnetic ink character recognition) system, E-13B, used on bank cheques. He then continued to design the rest of the letters of the alphabet in his spare time, basing their proportions on that of the Gill Sans typeface.The truth about Westminster (the font!), MERCER DESIGN The MICR E-13B font was designed for automated reading by a very simple magnetic reader in the early days of automatic character recognition. The weight of strokes in the characters can be recognised as \\"light\\" or \\"heavy\\" by a simple circuit and these patterns then map directly to the bit patterns of a computer character set. This made the characters practical to read before 'smart' OCR, but limited the length of the character set. E-13B has only 14 characters: the numeric digits and a few control codes. None of the alphanumeric 'computer' typefaces like Westminster could be read magnetically. The work was presented to Letraset, who declined to buy it, but soon after released their own rival typeface, Data 70. Other contemporary typefaces based on E-13B include Moore Computer (recognisable by its dots underneath the letters M and N), Gemini, Orbit-B, and Countdown. Later, Typodermic released another derivative, Minicomputer. Robert Norton, founder of the Photoscript Ltd photo-typesetting company, decided to produce Westminster. The font was named by Norton and, according to Microsoft, received its name from the Westminster Bank Limited (now NatWest) from the United Kingdom) because it helped fund the font's production. The font was included with Microsoft software after Microsoft hired Norton. Since its design, the typeface has been strongly associated with computers, especially in the late 1960s and early-to- mid 1970s. The font is used frequently to indicate computer involvement in television series, films, books, and comics.

Besides that he was also a writer, scientist and a Statesman, a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board at its founding in 1938, a Delegate of the United States to the 1944 Chicago Conference for the Convention on International Civil Aviation, and an international civil servant. Edward Warner's achievements are commemorated by the world's civil aviation community in the international award that bears his name. Biography Edward Warner grew up in Boston, Massachusetts, where he went to the Volkmann School. He studied at Harvard University in 1916 and specialized in mathematics. After graduating he went on to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he graduated in 1917 in mechanical engineering with additional credits in naval architecture. At the end of World War I, he was appointed Chief Physicist of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in charge of aerodynamic research at the station at Langley Field, which NACA had just established. From 1920 to 1926, he was an associate professor of aeronautics at MIT. Jimmy Doolittle was among his students. From 1926 to 1929, he served as the first Assistant Secretary of the Navy (AIR). After World War II, Edward Warner became one of the leading persons in the raising of civil aviation, realizing his dream of a world air transport system based on international co-operation, which is now known as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). He became the first President of the Council of ICAO during its provisional status from 1945 to 1947, and continued as President until his retirement in 1957. In 1956, ICAO received from the City of Genoa its famed Christopher Columbus Award, which included a sum of more than $7,000, for ICAO's efforts in the development of international co- operation in air transportation. The ICAO Council subsequently decided to use these funds to establish its own continuing series of awards which would commemorate Dr. Edward Warner's great spirit and service to international civil aviation and give special recognition to individuals or institutions whose contribution towards the further development of civil aviation is outstanding. This became the Edward Warner Award.

It is from via . It is managed by Great Western Railway. History The station opened with the Cornwall Railway on 4 May 1859. It was described at the time as \\"built of rubble masonry, in the Italian style of architecture, which style is adopted at all stations on the railway. It consists of an arrival, departure, and goods stations, the two former being stone structures, and the last a wooden erection\\".West Briton and Cornwall Advertiser, Railway Special Edition, 1859 In 1865 the Royal Agricultural Show was held at nearby at Pennycomequick and so the opportunity was taken to enlarge the platforms at Devonport. A \\"refreshment booth\\" was also erected for the duration of the show to cater for the large number of visitors expected. The Cornwall Railway was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway on 1 July 1889. The Great Western Railway was nationalised into British Railways from 1 January 1948 which was in turn privatised in the 1990s. For a while after 1948 the station was known as Devonport Albert Road to distinguish it from the ex-London and South Western Railway Kings Road station (now the site of the City College Plymouth). The name reverted to just \\"Devonport\\" from 6 May 1968. The goods shed was originally situated in front of the station near the tunnel entrance, but a new goods yard was opened in about 1892 on a larger site east of the station. This was accessed beneath a girder bridge that carried Valletort Road. The old goods shed and sidings were removed in 1903 and replaced by new sidings which handled milk traffic until 1957. Valletort Road goods depot was closed in April 1957 and was then used for about forty years by the railway civil engineers. The station became unstaffed from 19 May 1969. =Signalling= The station was initially controlled by disc-and-crossbar signals controlled locally. The first signal box opened on 9 November 1877, a 20-lever box with semaphore signals, but it was extended in about 1892 to 29 levers to accommodate the new goods yard at Valletort Road. The signal box was replaced by a new one in October 1899 when the line was doubled to Keyham. It closed on 26 November 1960 since when multiple-aspect signals have been controlled by the panel signal box at Plymouth railway station. Description The station is in a cutting at the top of an incline which climbs up from Plymouth. Immediately to the west of the station the line curves sharply to the right and enters a short tunnel. The entrance is on the platform served by trains to Gunnislake and Saltash. The second platform that is served by trains to Plymouth is reached by a footbridge. To walk to Devonport, turn right out of the station, right again over the tunnel. On reaching the main road the shops and Dockyard are down the hill to your left. Torpoint Ferry can be reached by turning left out of the station and then following the park down the hill. To walk to Stoke, turn left out of the station and at the main road turn left again. Services A train to Penzance Devonport is served by Tamar Valley Line services from to , and also by certain trains on the Cornish Main Line to and from , some of which continue eastwards beyond Plymouth towards or London Paddington. Community railway The railway from Plymouth to Gunnislake is designated as a community railway and is supported by marketing provided by the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership. The line is promoted under the \\"Tamar Valley Line\\" name. The Lounge pub near Devonport station takes part in the Tamar Valley Line rail ale trail, which is designed to promote the use of the line. The line is also part of the Dartmoor Sunday Rover network of integrated bus and rail routes.

It is a common species throughout most of Europe but is lacking in the very dry southern regions. The northernmost occurrence is Iceland, and above the Arctic circle. It also occurs in Siberia and in North Mongolia. The species has been introduced to North America. In the Alps it rises to an altitude of 2100 meters. Description John Curtis's British Entomology Volume 5 This species is unusual for a noctuid in that there is marked sexual dimorphism. The male has a wingspan of 27–32 mm but the female is much larger with a wingspan of 35–39 mm. The forewings are brown, speckled with black and marked with a bold white branched basal streak which gives the species its common name. The hindwings are dark brown with a white fringe. Technical description and variation Forewing olive grey or olive rufous, or olive fuscous; median and marginal areas sometimes deeper coloured, otherwise the 3 lines are undefined; stigmata pale, especially the reniform, which at base is white, emitting a ray basewards along the median vein, and two externally along veins 3 and 4; claviform elongate; orbicular flattened; hindwing dark fuscous grey, with the basal area pale, sometimes whitish; the fringe white; - in the form tricuspis male Esp. the reniform with its trifid lower end is more strongly developed than usual; - of this obsoleta Tutt is only an extreme form in which the other markings are obsolete; - rufocosta Tutt is a grey form with red costal streak, from the Hebrides; -in hibernicus Curt. the base of cell of forewing bears a pale, elongated, sometimes forked patch; - in albipuncta Sven the white lower end of reniform is entire, without pale ramification: - gramineus Haw. has all the veins whitish, the intervals dark olive, without any rufous mixture, the stigmata and base of cell more conspicuously pale: the submarginal line prominently pale and dentate along the veins, the teeth alternating with the dark teeth of the marginal area: this is the commoner form in the North of Britain, of which the form pallida Tutt is evidently an extreme development, the pale claviform, median vein, and two upper stigmata coalescing to form a broad white band from base; - grisea Spul. from N. Germany is a grey form with the median area well-defined, and may be only an offshoot of gramineis, which is not much known on the continent.Seitz, A.

It also flies at night and is attracted to light. The adults are on the wing from July to September.The flight season refers to the British Isles. This may vary in other parts of the range. Life cycle The grey larva feeds on various grasses including Deschampsia, Festuca and Nardus. It is sometimes so common that it damages pastures. The species overwinters as an egg.

It was the only all-Scandinavian regiment in the Union Army. On 8 October 1862, Colonel Heg led his regiment into its first action at the Battle of Perryville. Despite being under fire while being driven back several miles by the enemy, the 15th Wisconsin suffered few casualties and no fatalities. However, one of those hurt was Colonel Heg, who was injured when his horse fell. Heg commanded the regiment during the Battle of Stones River. In response to his conduct at Stones River, Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans placed Heg in command of the newly formed 3rd Brigade of the 1st Division, XX Corps, Army of the Cumberland, on May 1, 1863. Heg fought in the Tullahoma campaign of June-July 1863.

The words \\"\\" were spray-painted on the plinth, just above Heg's name. Forward, a statue designed by Jean Pond Miner Coburn to represent the state of Wisconsin, was also pulled down. Both statues were later recovered by the authorities, though Heg was said to have lost a leg. At a July 20, 2020, meeting of the Wisconsin Capitol and Executive Residence Board the board voted unanimously to restore both Heg's statue and Forward to their original condition and placement atop their pedestals. Since his statue's head was still missing, state officials plan to create a new one using a statue of Heg in the town of Norway as a model.

Although he is remembered today primarily for his adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall of the House of Usher, he directed three dozen films and was an influential critic of literature and film from the early 1920s through the late 1940s. He is often associated with French Impressionist Cinema and the concept of photogénie. Life and career Epstein was born in Warsaw, Kingdom of Poland (then a part of Russian Empire) to a French-Jewish father and Polish mother. After his father died in 1908, the family relocated to Switzerland, where Epstein remained until beginning medical school at the University of Lyon in France. While in Lyon, Epstein served as a secretary and translator for Auguste Lumière, considered one of the founders of cinema. Epstein started directing his own films in 1922 with Pasteur, followed by L'Auberge rouge and Coeur fidèle (both 1923). Film director Luis Buñuel worked as an assistant director to Epstein on Mauprat (1926) and La Chute de la maison Usher (1928). Epstein's criticism appeared in the early modernist journal L'Esprit Nouveau. During the making of Coeur fidèle Epstein chose to film a simple story of love and violence \\"to win the confidence of those, still so numerous, who believe that only the lowest melodrama can interest the public\\", and also in the hope of creating \\"a melodrama so stripped of all the conventions ordinarily attached to the genre, so sober, so simple, that it might approach the nobility and excellence of tragedy\\".Jean Epstein (1924) \\"Présentation de Coeur fidèle\\", in Écrits sur le cinéma, 1, 124 (January 1924), quoted in Richard Abel, French Cinema: the first wave 1915-1929 (Princeton University Press, 1984), p. 360. He made several documentaries about Brittany. These include Finis Terræ filmed in Ouessant, Mor vran (The sea of the crows, in Breton) filmed in Sein, L'Or des mers filmed in Hoëdic, Le Tempestaire filmed in Belle Île. Chanson d'Armor is known as the first Breton-speaking film in history. His two novels also take place in Breton isles: L'Or des mers in Ouessant and Les Recteurs et la sirène in Sein. In August 2005, his films The Three-Sided Mirror (1927) and Le Tempestaire (1947) were restored and re-released on the DVD collection Avant- Garde: Experimental Cinema of the 1920s and 1930s.

In addition to her volleyball commitments, Pottharst is the face of \\"beach2xl\\", a corporate team building program, and does motivational speaking.  Sporting career  Pottharst began playing indoor volleyball in 1982 and by 1990 was recognised as one of the best volleyball players in Australia. A serious knee injury in 1992 forced her off the hard court and she began playing beach volleyball. She partnered with Natalie Cook, and together, they represented Australia at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, winning a bronze medal – the very first time that beach volleyball had been an Olympic sport. In the same year, the pair won a silver medal at the world championships, and came first in the World Tour Event in Japan. Cook and Pottharst split for a few years afterwards, but reunited in time for the Sydney Olympics. Before the games, they finished third in the World Tour Events in France and Portugal. At the games themselves, the pair dominated the competition, taking out the gold medal. In the aftermath of their Olympic win, the pair were awarded the Order of Australia, Australia's highest honor. Cook and Pottharst were included in the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball's Team of the Decade. After the Olympics, Pottharst retired, but has since come out of retirement and returned to competition. According to Worldwide beach volleyball statistics, Pottharst has never been outside of the top 10 and rarely outside of the top six in International Beach Volleyball events since 1994. Pottharst appeared on the Nine Network's TV reality show 'Celebrity Circus' in 2005, in which she trained with stars of Australia's Silvers Circus.

When Cold Chillin' Records was formed in 1986, it was initially distributed by Prism, but label head Tyrone Williams and Fichtelberg decided to merge their companies. As a result, in 1989, the Prism name was phased out in favor of the new name. In 1987, Cold Chillin' signed a 5-year distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records. The first two Cold Chillin' releases through Warner Bros. (which, incidentally, were the second and third overall Cold Chillin' albums to be released) had the legend A Prism Records Production written on them. As Warner Bros. Records' premier hip-hop-based subsidiary label, Cold Chillin' released many classic records in the late 1980s and early 1990s from such notable acts as Big Daddy Kane, Biz Markie, Kool G.

As the 1990s progressed though, the label began to flounder. Its deal with Warner Bros. ended, and it began having its records released through Epic Records. Cold Chillin', however, continued to lose steam, and folded in 1998. Today the namesake is still used on its reissues and the catalog and trademark, save for the recordings of Big Daddy Kane and Kool G.

Dismissed from the civil service at the Restoration, Ducange became one of the favorite authors of the liberal party, and owed some part of his popularity to the fact that he was fined and imprisoned more than once for his outspokenness. He was six months in prison for an article in his journal (1822); for Valentine (1821), in which the royalist excesses in the south of France were pilloried, he was again imprisoned; and after the publication of (1823), he took refuge for some time in Belgium. Ducange wrote numerous plays and melodramas, among which the most successful were (1836), and (1827), in which Frédérick Lemaître found one of his best parts. Many of his books were prohibited, ostensibly for their coarseness, but perhaps rather for their political tendencies. He died in Paris.

The only currently fully accepted species is Chamaerops humilis, variously called European fan palm or the Mediterranean dwarf palm. It is one of the most cold-hardy palms and is used in landscaping in temperate climates.Herrera, J. 1989. On the reproductive biology of the dwarf palm, Chamaerops humilis, in southern Spain. Taxonomy Apart from the fully accepted Chamaerops humilis, there are a few taxa of unresolved status plus numerous species synonymised under Chamaerops humilis. The species Chamaerops humilis itself has three accepted varieties as follows: *Chamaerops humilis var. argentea André (syn. C. h. var. cerifera) – \\"Atlas mountain palm\\" of Northwest Africa. Leaves glaucous. *Chamaerops humilis var. epondraes – Northwest Africa. Leaves glaucous. *Chamaerops humilis var. humilis – Southwest Europe. Leaves green. There also are at least three cultivars (C. humilis var. humilis 'Nana', C. humilis 'Vulcano', C. humilis 'Stella'). C. humilis 'Vulcano' is a compact, thornless cultivar. May be silvery, but less so than argentea. The leaves tend to be thicker, and the appearance of the plant is bushier than var. humilis or var. argentea. The genus Chamaerops is closely related to the genus Trachycarpus. The genera differ in that Trachycarpus lacks the clumping habit (only forms single stems without basal suckers), the spiny leaf stems (spineless in Trachycarpus), and in small details of the flower anatomy.  Description  Chamaerops humilis var. argentea, south slopes of the High Atlas, Morocco. Zoom in to see the spines on the petioles. Chamaerops humilis is a shrub-like clumping palm, with several stems growing from a single base. It has an underground rhizome which produces shoots with palmate, sclerophyllous leaves. The stems grow slowly and often tightly together, eventually reaching tall with a trunk diameter of . It is a fan palm (Arecaceae tribe Corypheae), and as such, has leaves with petioles terminating in rounded fans of 10–20 leaflets. Each leaf is up to long, with leaflets long. The petioles are armed with numerous sharp, needle- like spines; these may protect the stem growing point from browsing animals. The flowers are borne in dense, short inflorescences at the tops of the stems. The plants usually, but not invariably, are dioecious with male and female flowers on separate plants. The prophyll covers the flowers on the inflorescence until the sexual phase (anthesis) and then splits open apically into two triangular lobes. The number of flowers per inflorescence is highly variable for both male and female plants, depending on the size of the inflorescence. Female flowers are tri-ovulate.Dufay M. 2010. Impact of plant flowering phenology on the cost/benefit balance in a nursery pollination mutualism, with honest males and cheating females. J Evol Biol 23:977-86. Unripe fruits are bright green, turning to dull yellow to brown as they ripen during autumn (September–November). The seed (usually ) contains a small cylindrical embryo, which is surrounded by several layers, from inner to outer as follows: * a nutritious endosperm, * a wide woody layer or endocarp, * a fleshy and fibrous mesocarp (the pulp), and * the thin outer layer or exocarp.Hasnaoui, O., M. Bouazza, and M. Thinon. 2009. Kinetical germination study of the Chamaerops humilis L. var. argentea Andre (Arecaceae). Environmental Research Journal 3:76–80.  Distribution  Chamaerops humilis is one of only two palm species native to continental Europe, the other being Phoenix theophrasti. It is mainly found in southwestern Europe, over all the south coasts of Spain and Portugal, central and southern Italy, some parts of the southern Mediterranean coast of France and Monaco, in the islands of Malta, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Majorca, Ibiza, Menorca, Formentera (Balearic Islands)http://www.caib.es/sites/xarxaforestal/ca/chamaerops_humilis-25007/ as well as northwest Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia).WCSP, World Checklist of Palms: Chamaerops Euro+Med Plantbase Project: Chamaerops humilis It is one of the northernmost naturally occurring palms in the world, with the northernmost standing in Metropolitan City of Genoa, Italy, at 44°N.Francesco Orsino & Silvia Olivari (1987) The presence of Chamaerops humilis L. on Portofino promontory (East Liguria), Webbia, 41:2, 261-272 Although not naturally occurring far north from the Mediterranean, Chamaerops humilis grows well as far north as southern England.  Cultivation  Chamaerops humilis is valued in gardening and landscaping in many parts of the world. It is very drought- tolerant once established. It is hardy to , but does prefer hot summers. It is a very slow-growing plant. The blue form of the species, native to high elevations of the Atlas Mountains, has recently been introduced into the trade and early reports indicate that it may be 12 or more degrees Celsius hardier than the green form. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.  Ecology and interactions with animals  Derelomus chamaeropsis, a weevil, is the only known significant insect pollinator of Chamaerops humilis. In southern Spain, the Eurasian badger Meles meles is the main seed disperser of C. humilisFedriani, J.M., and M. Delibes. 2011. Dangerous liaisons disperse the Mediterranean dwarf palm: fleshy-pulp defensive role against seed predators. Ecology 92:304–315. Chamaerops humilis flowers in spring, typically from April to May. The plant also may be partly anemophilous, that is to say, wind-pollinated, but it is at least partly entomophilous, that is to say dependent on pollination by insects. Only one insect species is known to pollinate it, namely a specific weevil, Derelomus chamaeropsis in the family Curculionidae.Dufay M. 2010 The nature of the relationship with the weevil is a version of nursery pollination mutualism with the weevil; the form this takes is that once pollinating weevils have found a satisfactory plant, whether male or female, they usually stay on the same plant until the end of its anthesis, finding shelter, egg-laying sites, and food in the inflorescences. At anthesis, as is common in angiosperms, both male and female Chamaerops humilis plants attract their pollinators with chemical compounds, but an unusual feature is that their scents are released by the leaves, and not by the flowers.Dufay, M., Anstett, M.-C. & Hossaert- McKey, M. 2003. When leaves act like flowers : how dwarf palms attract their pollinators. Ecol. Lett. 6: 28–34. Towards the end of anthesis, weevils leave the plant and seek a new host plant, again either male or female. Larval development of the weevil Derelomus chamaeropsis occurs within rachises of inflorescences of male plants during autumn and winter. At the beginning of the next flowering period, adult weevils emerge from the dry and brittle stems of old inflorescences of the previous year of male plants only. Those that hatch in female plants die without concluding their development. This is because the palmettos are adapted to prevent the pollinating weevils from destroying the female inflorescences with their burden of seed. Weevils have been shown to lay eggs within female inflorescences, but as soon as seeds start to develop, eggs or larvae fail to continue their life cycle. On the other hand, male inflorescences have completed their function after pollination, so it is advantageous to the plant's reproduction for the weevils to complete their life cycles and shelter in the male inflorescences, thereby remaining available for pollination when they emerge in the following season.Dufay, M. & Anstett, M.-C. 2004. Cheating is not always punished: killer female plants and pollination by deceit in the dwarf palm Chamaerops humilis. J. Evol. Biol. 17: 862–868. The ripe pulp of C. humilis has several important functions.Fedriani, J.M., and M. Delibes. 2011 *When ripened, the pulp smells strongly of rancid butterHerrera, J. 1989 and thus acts as a foraging cue for nocturnal frugivores that commonly are fundamentally carnivorous mammals such as badgers and foxes. *The pulp inhibits germination, ensuring that the seed does not germinate until has been dispersed. *The pulp also acts as a chemical or physical barrier against invertebrate seed predators, typically beetles, and in particular weevils. Because of the combination of such functions in the pulp, the palm both benefits and suffers adverse consequences when carnivores feed on the fruit and thereby remove the pulp. On the one hand, the seeds that carnivores swallow, germinate more frequently than seeds in entire fruit. On the other hand, ingested seeds are more frequently destroyed by invertebrate pests than non-ingested seeds. However, because of the mobility of carnivores, their dispersal service is important to the palmetto, given the severe fragmentation and isolation of most populations across the increasingly densely populated Mediterranean basin.  Uses and threats  Chamaerops humilis has a wide distribution in uncultivated land, and it is adapted to regimes of frequent burning, which it survives largely by re-sprouting from underground rhizomes and from fire- damaged stems. Such factors make the species ecologically important in preventing erosion and desertification and in providing shelter and food to many species of animals. Apart from its material benefits, this palmetto is of emotional value as a charismatic component of the \\"garrigues\\" and \\"macchias\\" of the Mediterranean coastline. The leaves of the adult plants have been used to make brooms and for weaving mats, carrier baskets, and similar articles. For finer work the young, unopened leaves are treated with sulphur to soften them softer and provide supple fibre. The husk, known in southern Spain as \\"higa\\", is edible before it becomes too tough to eat as it matures. Because of their bitterness and high tannin content, the fruit are not used for human food, but in traditional medicine they have been used as an astringent.Merlo M.E., M.M. Aleman, J. Cabello, and J. Penas. 1993. On the Mediterranean Fan Palm (Chamaerops humilis). Principes 37: 151-8. Urbanization and other human activities are making such rapid inroads into the natural habitat of palmetto that they are raising concerns about its future and that of its environment. Accordingly, there is an increase in regulations to protect both its stands and those of associated Mediterranean endemics. Another conservation problem is that particularly in the northernmost parts of its natural range, Chamaerops humilis is seriously threatened by an introduced South American moth Paysandisia archon.Parcs Nationaux de France: Hyères-les-(ex)-Palmiers International Palm Society: Importation of Mature Palms: A Threat to Native and Exotic Palms in Mediterranean Countries? Also, this Mediterranean native palm is affected by the introduction of related ornamental species because of the concurrent introduction of seed predators (such as Coccotrypes dactyliperda and Dactylotrypes longicollis) that feed on both the introduced and native palms.Rodríguez M, M. Delibes and JM Fedriani. 2014. Hierarchical levels of seed predation variation by introduced beetles on an endemic Mediterranean palm. PLOS One.

Sjöstadsparterren, Hammarby Sjöstad, 2005 Hammarby Sjöstad (roughly translated: Hammarby Lake City) is a part of the inner city of Stockholm, currently undergoing major urban redevelopment. It is located on both sides of lake Hammarby Sjö, bordering Nacka Municipality to the east. The area is part of the districts Södermalm and Södra Hammarbyhamnen. Before the current redevelopment began, the area was known as Norra Hammarbyhamnen and Södra Hammarbyhamnen (roughly South Hammarby Port), a mainly industrial zone, centered on the Lumafabriken works, a piece of functionalist architecture designed by Eskil Sundahl and Arthur von Schmalensee, which now houses a library and offices. The neighbouring Lugnet was a run-down light industrial area, not intended to be permanent, housing an impromptu trailer park. On the north side of the lake, the Norra Hammarbyhamnen area was used as a harbour area, with a railway connecting the area. New plans for most of the Södermalm area Norra Hammarbyhamnen in the early 1990s opened the door for a redevelopment of the entire area around the water expanse Hammarby Sjö. A general plan, featuring an extension of the Tvärbanan light rail link from Gullmarsplan through the area was presented. Although the south and east part of Hammarby Sjöstad is located outside what is traditionally considered to be the perimeter of inner-city Stockholm, the design is intentionally semi-urban rather than suburban, with boulevards, somewhat defined and architecturally varied city blocks, and commercial spaces in the ground floor of some buildings. The location, next to the lake Hammarby Sjö and a canal, Sickla Kanal, has allowed for plenty of quays and walkways along the water. The area also included the 1940s area Danviksklippan that remains unchanged of the ongoing development. Neighbourhoods includes most of Norra Hammarbyhamnen, Tegelviksgatan, Sickla Udde, Sickla Kaj, Luma and Sickla Kanal. Administratively, Hammarby Sjöstad is a part of the Stockholm Municipality borough of Södermalm. It belonged to the former borough of Katarina-Sofia, which merged with Maria-Gamla Stan borough into Södermalm borough on January 1, 2007.

Another maternal great grandfather, Dr. George Spalatin Easterday, was mayor of Albuquerque, New Mexico;http://econtent.unm.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/CobbMem&CISOPTR;=272&CISOBOX;=1&REC;=3 and her great, great grandfather John Rankin Rogers, was third governor of the state of Washington and supporter of the “Barefoot School Boy Act.”http://www.wsulibs.wsu.edu/masc/finders/cg615.htm Stiles’ father's ancestry is all of Irish immigrants from Old Castle, County Cavan, but her grandfather William Joseph Dolan was born in Boston, trained in Italy as an interior decorator, and worked as a decorator of Catholic churches. Stiles retained her last name from her first marriage (1967–1974) to attorney Randolph Stiles. Education Stiles earned her B.A. in Art History from San Jose State University in California (1970), and her M.A. (1974) and Ph.D. (1987) in the History of Art from the University of California, Berkeley, where she studied with Peter SelzPaul J. Karlstrom, Peter Selz: Sketches of a Life in Art. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2012. and Herschel B. Chipp,http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb7c6007sj&doc.view;=frames&chunk.id;=div00006&toc.depth;=1&toc.id;= both known for their focus on artists’ writings, the social history of art, and international art, concentrations that shaped Stiles's scholarly direction. Stiles's doctoral dissertation, \\"The Destruction in Art Symposium (DIAS): The Radical Social Project of Event-Structured Live Art\\" (1987),Kristine Stiles, “Synopsis of the Destruction in Art Symposium (DIAS) and Its Theoretical Significance,” The Act 1 (Spring 1987): 22–31. was the first thesis on the subject of destruction in art. DIAS took place in London in 1966, was organized by Gustav Metzgerhttps://www.amazon.com/Gustav-Metzger- History-Justin-Hoffmann/dp/3775716505 (about whom Stiles has also published extensivelyKristine Stiles, “The Story of DIAS and the ‘DIAS Affect’,” in Gustav Metzger. Vienna: Generali Foundation, 2005.Kristine Stiles, “Metzger’s Fierce, Poignant, and Prescient Manifestos” in Rett Kopi Documents the Future. Oslo, Norway: Rett Kopi, 2007.), and some fifty international artists, and poets, as well as a few psychiatrists participated in DIAS. One of Stiles's principal theoretical contributions to the history of performance art was her 1987 dissertation argument that the presentation of the artist's performing body initiates a new communicative structure in the visual arts, appending the traditional re-presentational role of metaphor with the connective function of metonymy. Countering the widespread claim in the early post-1945 period that performance art breaks down the barriers between art and life, Stiles asserted that metonymy augments interpersonal communication through its linking function, and expands the conventional modes of visual communication by creating the potential for an exchange between presenting and viewing subjects.Kristine Stiles, “Synopsis of the Destruction in Art Symposium (DIAS) and its Theoretical Significance,” The Act vol. 1 (Spring 1987): 22–31. Career Stiles is among a handful of scholars who, in the late 1970s, laid the foundation for studying post-1945 performance art and related forms, writing about the pioneering artists of happenings, Fluxus, performance art, and new media.

In the aftermath of the attack, a number of others were able to jump from the train too. In all, 233 people managed to escape, of whom 118 ultimately survived. The remainder were either killed during the escape or were recaptured soon afterwards. The attack was unusual as an attempt by the resistance to free Jewish deportees and marks the only \\"mass breakout\\" by deportees on a Holocaust train. Background Between 70,000 and 75,000 Jews were living in Belgium in 1940. Few were long-term residents in Belgium and many entered the country during the Interwar to flee persecution in Germany and Eastern Europe. Soon after the German invasion of Belgium in May 1940, the German occupation authorities introduced a number of anti-Jewish laws. In 1942, the yellow badge was introduced for all Belgian Jews. In August 1942, as part of the Final Solution, the deportation of Belgian Jews to concentration and extermination camps in Eastern Europe in sealed railway convoys began. Of these, 46 percent were deported from the former Mechelen transit camp, while 5,034 more people were deported via the Drancy internment camp (close to Paris). The Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA) in Berlin was responsible for organizing the transport and the chief of the Dossin Barracks (sammellager) prepared the paper convoy list in triplicate. One copy was for the police officer in charge of security during the transport, the second for the sammellager in Mechelen and the third for the BSD-department located in Brussels. Because all the copies for the Dossin Barracks were preserved, historians have been able to trace and map all the German transports of Belgian Jews to the concentration camps. From the summer of 1942 until 1944, twenty-eight transports left Belgium to bring 25,257 Jews and 351 Roma (gypsies) to eastern Europe. Their destination was usually Auschwitz-Birkenau. The attack Dossin Barracks On 19 April 1943, the twentieth transport left Mechelen transit camp carrying 1,631 Jewish men, women and children. For the first time, the third-class wagons were replaced by freight wagons with barbed wire covering the small windows. A special wagon, Sonderwagen, was added with 19 Jews (18 men and one woman) consisting of resistance members and \\"jumpers\\" from previous transports. These \\"special list\\" prisoners were marked on the back of their clothes with a cross painted in red, in order to kill them immediately on arrival at Auschwitz. Eventually, three prisoners escaped from the wagon; a fourth was shot. Three young students and members of the Belgian resistance including a Jewish doctor, Youra Livchitz (fr) and his two non-Jewish friends Robert Maistriau (fr)Robert Maistriau – his activity to save Jews' lives during the Holocaust, at Yad Vashem website and Jean Franklemon (fr), armed with one pistol, a lantern and red paper to create a makeshift red lantern (to use as a danger signal), were able to stop the train on the track Mechelen-Leuven, between the municipalities of Boortmeerbeek and Haacht. The twentieth convoy was guarded by one officer and fifteen men from the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo-SD), who came from Germany. Despite these security measures, Maistriau was able to open one wagon and liberate 17 people. Other prisoners escaped from the convoy without any connection with the attack. The train driver, Albert Dumon, did all he could to keep the slowest pace between Tienen and Tongeren, stopping whenever it was possible and justifiable, and so allow that more people could jump without killing themselves. In all, 233 people succeeded in escaping from the train. 89 were eventually recaptured and put on later convoys. 26 others were killed, either by shooting or by the fall, and 118 who succeeded in escaping. The youngest, Simon Gronowski, was only 11 years old. Regine Krochmal (fr), an eighteen- year-old nurse with the resistance, also escaped after she cut the wooden bars put in front of the train air inlet with a bread knife and jumped from the train near Haacht. Both survived the war. Later journey The site of the attack on the convoy within Belgium On April 22, 1943, the train arrived at Auschwitz. During the selection, only 521 ID numbers (276 men and 245 women) were assigned. Of these, 521 were selected to be slave laborers, and only 150 people ultimately survived the war. The remaining 874 non-selected people were immediately murdered in the gas chambers of Auschwitz II-Birkenau. It is believed that, as a result of the escape, an unusually large proportion of the prisoners from the convoy were killed on arrival. As many as 70 percent of the female prisoners were killed immediately in the gas chambers, while the rest were assigned for medical experimentation. Aftermath Items used during the attack, now in the collection of the Kazerne Dossin Museum in Belgium The attack was unusual as an attempt by the resistance to free Jewish deportees and marks the only \\"mass breakout\\" by deportees. The twentieth convoy was an exceptionally large convoy and was the first transport to use freight cars with doors fenced with barbed-wire. The previous transports used 3rd class wagons on which it was easy to escape through the windows. After the twentieth convoy, each convoy was reinforced with a German reserve company (based in Brussels) until it reached the German border. The three resistance members who executed the raid met the following fates: * Youra Livchitz (1917-1944): a month after the raid on the convoy Livchitz was arrested by the Gestapo. He managed to overpower his guard, put on his uniform and escape from Gestapo headquarters in Brussels. On June 26, 1943 Youra Livchitz and his brother Alexander were stopped by the Feldgendarmerie. In their car weapons were found and they were arrested. On February 17, 1944 Youra Livchitz was executed by firing squad in Schaarbeek. * Jean Franklemon (1917-1977): after the raid on the convoy Franklemon was arrested on August 4, 1943 and imprisoned at Fort Breendonk. On March 14, 1944 a German court-martial sentenced him to six years imprisonment. In April 1944 he was transported to Sonnenburg concentration camp as a Nacht und Nebel prisoner. In November 1944 he was moved to Sachsenhausen. After the liberation, Franklemon remained in Germany where he died in 1977. * Robert Maistriau (1921-2008): after the raid on the convoy, Maistriau fled to the Ardennes forest, where he hid with the partisans for seven months. He took part in La Grand Coupure, a resistance action which on January 15, 1944 destroyed 20 electricity pylons. On March 20, 1944 Maistriau was arrested by the Sicherheitspolizei. He was held at Fort Breendonk before being transported to Buchenwald. After further periods in concentration camps near Harzungen (a subcamp of Mittelbau-Dora) and Elrich, he was moved to Bergen-Belsen, where he was liberated on April 15, 1945. He moved to the Belgian Congo in 1949. He died in 2008 in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert. In remembrance of the action of the resistance, a statue was inaugurated in 1993 near the train station of Boortmeerbeek. It remembers the Holocaust and the transport of 25,483 Jews and 351 Roma over the railway track Mechelen-Leuven to the concentration camps.

Subject to Only Some SEC Regulations An offer to purchase less than 5% of the company's securities is not governed by Section 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act or Regulation 14D and is not required to be filed on a Schedule TO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Thus, mini-tenders do not have to make all the disclosures required for larger tender offers, though they remain subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act that state that it is illegal \\"to make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or to engage in any fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices, in connection with any tender offer.\\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/34-43069.htm/ref The SEC advises extreme caution, so an investor should carefully read the mini- tender disclosures and check any market prices with his or her broker. Many mini-tender offers are made with respect to companies that do not trade on an established market. Furthermore, some mini-tender offers are irrevocable once signed, whereas registered tender offers must allows investors to change their minds up until the offer period expires. The back office systems of many broker-dealers do not distinguish between mini-tenders and SEC-registered tender offers. A mini-tender is never labeled as a \\"mini-tender.\\" It has been reported that investors assume that mini-tenders have the same protections as larger tenders, simply because both types of offers are presented as a solicitation on the broker's letterhead. Some mini-tenders are exchange offers, in which one security is exchanged for another. If the investor tenders publicly traded shares in return for shares with no liquid market, they will receive securities that they cannot readily sell. Rationale Most mini-tenders are made below the value of the security. In some cases, the bidder may be able to turn around and sell the acquired shares at market for a profit. In other cases, the mini-tenders may be for securities that do not have an established market, in which case the purchaser may profit sometime in the future if distributions from such securities exceed the purchase price (or, may lose money if the purchaser was wrong in estimating the security's underlying value). In contrast, traditional tender offers launched with the goal of taking over a company are registered with the SEC and usually offer a substantial premium to market value. Some deceptive mini-tenders have been made at a small premium to the market, but remain open for weeks or months, locking in the investors' tendered shares. Such bidders are gambling that the market price will eventually rise above the initial bid premium, so they can profit while investors lose out (despite initially believing that they tendered at a premium). However, the bidder must purchase the shares according to the terms of the offer regardless of whether market price has risen, so the bidder may end up losing that gamble. However, if the offer terms allow, the bidder can continually keep extending the expiration date to give the market price more time to rise above the offer. Thus, investors should read such offers to see if the bidder reserves the right to continually extend the offer. Many bidders provide that they may extend only one time for a limited period. As many mini-tenders do not offer withdrawal rights, the investor essentially loses control of his shares. Some have argued that the bidder is in a no-lose situation either way, if the market price never exceeds the offer price, the mini-tender will be withdrawn and the investors never get their premium. However, many would argue that if a bidder has the right to withdraw the offer, so must the investor, or the contract is illusory (see Illusory contract). If the market price of the stock falls below the mini-tender price before the offer closes, the bidder can cancel the offer or reduce the offer price. While a price change allows investors to withdraw their shares, this process is not automatic. The onus is on the investor, as they (and not the bidder or broker) are responsible for acquiring the revised offer information and withdrawing their shares by the deadline. A mini-tender offer may be structured on a first come, first purchase basis, where the bidder accepts shares in order of receipt. Consequently, investors may be pressured into believing that they are obligated to tender their shares before having solid information about the offer. Mini-tenders often provide a market for investors to sell illiquid securities. Some have argued that this assertion is invalid because the bidder would have more difficulty selling the shares than individual investors, since they have a larger block of accumulated shares. While this is true if bidders are attempting to turn a quick profit, many bidders' strategies are to buy and hold the securities for the long-term. Example The practice is frequently associated with a company called TRC Capital, a private firm founded by a Canadian securities lawyer. MacKenzie Capital Management, LP, based in Moraga, California, also conducts hundreds of mini-tender offers and SEC registered tender offers each year, but for illiquid limited partnerships, real estate investment trusts, and other securities, ones not traded on a national exchange. The boards of target companies such as Adobe Systems, Fastenal, MetLife, AMD, Ford, and Kimberly- Clark have attempted to counter mini-tenders by issuing recommendations to reject such offers. Brian Lawler of The Motley Fool recommends that investors avoid mini-tender offers.

They and are believed to be part of the ongoing south Thailand insurgency. At least two people were killed and 66 were injured in the explosions. No one claimed responsibility for the blasts, but they may to be linked to the Patani United Liberation Organisation (PULO), which has been an active participant in the south Thailand insurgency in Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala. The attacks in Songkhla Province may have suggested that insurgent activity was expanding, or simply that security in Songkhla province was more lax than in the three southern provinces. The bombings, drive-by shootings and machete attacks in southern Thailand began in January 2004, and by April 2005 had resulted in over 600 deaths. Thai officials denied that the bombings were linked with the southern insurgency. Description The explosions took place between 20:00 to 20:30. A bomb planted in a garbage bin exploded in front of a Carrefour store in Hat Yai, injuring five and causing minor damage to the building. Shortly after that, a bomb inside a bag exploded at the departure hall of Hat Yai International Airport, killing two and injuring 47. The blast also caused some damage to the building. Later, a bomb planted on a motorcycle exploded in front of Green World Hotel in Songkhla without causing any injuries or deaths nor damage to the building. At least two people were killed and 66 were injured in the blasts: one man was killed instantly in one of the explosions while a woman sustained serious injuries and died later. Both of them were of Thai nationality. Of the 66 people injured, 60 were Thais, one was an American, one was French, two were from Brunei, and two were Malaysian. Many were seriously injured, and several were in critical condition. The dynamite and fertiliser bombs were set off by mobile phone. Images from the Hat Yai airport's closed circuit television indicated that the bomb was hidden in a man's luggage. Immediately following the bombings, security was heightened in the surrounding areas, in Bangkok, and at airports throughout the country. The attacks prompted some to emigrate from the violence-torn southern region of the country, and others to cancel their travel plans to the area. The Hat Yai airport was closed for six months following the bombings.

It is the capital of Ha'il Region, and has a population of about 605,930(2010). Ha'il is largely agricultural, with significant grain, date, and fruit production. A large percentage of the kingdom's wheat production comes from Ha'il Region, where the area to the northeast, away, consists of irrigated gardens. Historically, Ha'il derived its wealth from being on the camel caravan route of the Hajj. Ha'il is well known by the generosity of its people in Saudi Arabia and the Arab world as it is the place where Hatim al-Tai lived. It is also the homeland of the Rashid royal family, historical rivals to Saudi royal family.Hail - Lonely Planet History The construction of the Hejaz railway between Damascus and Medina, together with new inexpensive steamship routes to Jeddah, undermined the traditional camel caravan economy of Ha'il. The city of Ha'il was the capital of the Emirate of Jabal Shammar from 1836 until the Saudi conquest of the emirate in 1921. The emirate was led by a monarchy of the House of Rashīd. The first emir, Abdullah bin Rashid, took power with his brother emir Obaid and Jabbr's sons. Abdullah bin Rashid continued constructing the Barzan Palace in Ha'il which had been started by Mohammad Ibn Ali. After the death of Abdullah bin Rashid (in 1847 or 1848) his son and successor, Talal (or Telal), completed the palace. During the Rashidi period many foreign travelers visited Ha'il and the Rashidi emirs, and described their impressions in different journals and books, including those of Georg August Wallin (1854), William Gifford Palgrave (1865), Lady Anne Blunt (1881), Charles Montagu Doughty (1888), and Gertrude Bell (1914). Rashid emirs were considered relatively tolerant towards foreigners, including traders in Ha'il: The last Rashidi emir was ousted from power by Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia in 1921. Ibn Saud then gave orders to destroy the Barzan Palace and also ordered the leaders of Al Rashid and Al Sabhan to move from Ha'il to Riyadh, and he assigned one person from the mentioned families, as temporary emir \\"Prince Ibraheem bin Salem Al Sabhan\\" in order to assure the loyalty from the Ha'il people and Shammar. After this, Ha'il fell into steep decline, as witnessed by E. Rutter in 1931: Today, Ha'il is the center of Saudi Arabia's agricultural program, and most of the wheat crops of the kingdom come from the area surrounding the city. There are also a number of dairy farms for the production of dairy products near the city. Notable people *Hatim al-Tai was a famous Arabian poet who lived before Muhammad's preaching of Islam, and the father of the latter's companion Adi ibn Hatim and Safana bint Hatim. He was a Christian,Biography of Shaikh Bahi Dadiza (Arabic) and belonged to the Tayy Arabian tribe. Stories about his extreme generosity have made him an icon to Arabs up till the present day, as in the proverbial phrase \\"more generous than Hatem\\". There is a hill overlooking the city of Hail which has a reproduction of the campfire he lit to welcome his guests, which is turned on every night and can be seen from the center of the town. He was the ruler of his tribe. After Hatim's death, his son Adi became the ruler of Tayy. He also became a Muslim in 628 after a meeting with Muhammad. *Abdulaziz bin Mitab was the son of the third Amir of Al Rashid, he was adopted by his uncle Mohammed, the fifth amir, and brought up to be his heir. After Mohammed died of natural causes, Abdulaziz succeeded him unopposed. However, the Rashidi rule was insecure, as their Ottoman allies were unpopular and weakening. In 1904 the young Ibn Saud, the founder of Saudi Arabia, returned from exile with a small force and retook Riyadh. Abdulaziz died in the battle of Rawdat Muhanna with Ibn Saud Geography A view of the city from the top of Samra Mountain * As- Samra Mountain overlooks the city. This is where Hatim al-Tai lit a fire on the summit to welcome guests. Today an asphalted road goes to the summit where a natural gas-powered fire is lit at night. There is a park with a lake at the bottom of the mountain, and on the side of the mountain is the Emblem of Saudi Arabia (date palm and crossed swords) made from electric lights which are turned on at night. * Aja Mountain (Jebel Aja) is on the opposite side of Ha'il city from As-Samra. A huge Saudi flag made of electric lights, turned on at night, is located on the side of the mountain. * The Adayra Valley runs roughly along a north–south axis, dividing central Ha'il in two. =Climate= Ha'il has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with hot summers and cool winters. It has a somewhat milder climate than other Saudi cities due to its higher altitude. Sights Barzan Palace Corridor with rugs off courtyard of Barzan * Barzan Palace was a historic palace that used to be located in Ha'il up until the 1920s. It was built in 1808 by Prince Muhammad bin Abdul-Muhsin Al Ali over an area of more than 300,000 square meters. The Palace was completed during the rule of the 2nd Rashidi amir, Talal Ibn Abdullah (1848–68). The Palace consisted of 3 floors, the first had the reception halls, gardens, and kitchens. The second had the diplomatic guest rooms. The third had the royal family rooms. It was demolished at the orders of Ibn Saud after the conquest of Ha'il in 1921. * Barzan Souk is in the place where many years ago stood the Barzan Palace of the Al Rashid extended family who governed the area around Ha'il. * Friday Market is a traditional-style souk, held on Friday because it is a national weekend. * Garden Mall is the largest shopping mall in Hail, it has shops like lifestyle, shoe mart, babyshop, H&M;, giordano, iconic etc. \\"Samah Center\\" became the second largest shopping center in Ha'il. The third being the \\"Hyper Panda\\" shopping mall. * Airif Fort (also spelled Oreif) is on a hill on the edge of the city. It is a mud-brick (adobe) fort built over 200 years ago as a combined observation post and stronghold. There is a beautiful view of the city from the main watchtower. * Qishlah Fortress is an impressive sight located in the center of Ha'il. The current building was built in the 1940s while prince Abdul-Aziz bin Musa'ad Al Saud held office in Ha'il province. It is the largest traditional mud-brick fortress in Ha'il and is very well restored and preserved both outside and inside. It was used mostly as a barracks. Its two floors are 142.8x141.2 meters high, its walls are 8.5m high, and it has eight large watch-towers along with the wall with two main gates, eastern and western, and has a large inner courtyard with old military items on exhibition. * At- Turathy Restaurant is a large historical mud-brick building located in Ha'il center which is used as a traditional restaurant. Its appearance is half- restaurant, half-museum with a large number of local traditional items used as decorations. The atmosphere is very traditional, food is traditional, and seating is on the floor. * Ha'il Roundabouts are located in different parts of the city. These have large sculptures of traditional items located in the center of the traffic rotaries which are decorative fountains. One has a Gerba (traditional animal skin canteen) built as a fountain, another has a Mabakara (traditional incense burner) with Dellahs (traditional coffee pots) and cups around it built as a fountain. * Ha'il Museum is the museum of the city of Ha'il. It is also one of the places where visitors can buy permits to see the petroglyphs near Jubbah Oasis, the other place being Ateeq Naif al-Shammari's Jubbah Palace of Heritage museum just off the main street in the town of Jubbah itself. The rock carvings, which are believed to date from 5500 BC are in an area that is about an hour and a half from Ha'il city by car. Tours to the Nafud desert can also be organized there. * Aja Palace is located on the outskirts of the city. It is where the current governor of Ha'il province His Royal Highness Prince Saud Bin Abdul Mohsen Bin Abdul Aziz al Saud lives. It can only be seen from a distance - from the main highway nearby. It is a residential compound and as such is not open to the general public for sightseeing. * Ha'il Desert Life Festival is an annual festival held in the province of Ha'il to celebrate and exchange experiences about desert life and culture around the world. * Ha'il Rally is an important event in Ha'il and even in Saudi Arabia as it is the first car rally in Saudi Arabia, which started in 2006 and was approved by FIA in 2008. EducationHa'il University= The University of Ha'il (UoH) started as a community college, called Ha'il Community College (HCC), under the auspices of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in September 1998. HCC was the first Community College to open in a planned expansion of educational opportunities for Saudi Arabian high school graduates. HCC started by offering three-year associate degree programs in Business Administration, Computer Systems, and Electronic Engineering and Instrumentation. Later on, HCC offered three Bachelor degree programs in Applied Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Management Information Systems. The University of Ha'il was officially established on 14 June 2006. The university consisted of five colleges: College of MedicineCollege of Pharmacy & Medical Sciences, College of Science, College of Engineering, College of Computer Science & Computer Engineering, and Community College. The first students were admitted on 11 February 2006. In 2007, two existing colleges joined the university, the men's Ha'il Teachers College (now called the College of Education)and the Girls College of Education. These two colleges were originally under the auspices of the Ministry of Education. The university enrollment has now grown to more than 32,000 students. The University has several campuses inside the city, and is expanding. It has as a new campus under construction, which is located to the north of the city and covers an area of more than . Transportation Ha'il is located on Saudi Arabian highways 65,70 and 400, and is connected to 3 main highways, Madinah, Buraydah, and Jouf Highways, which connect Ha'il with the northern borders of Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom of Jordan. Ha'il has an important logistical role in northern Saudi Arabia's rail system (SAR). In 2008 Ha'il is the site of a concrete sleeper plant for railway construction. A railway (the north–south line) was completed in 2015 that extends from Riyadh to Al-Hadeetha in northern Saudi Arabia through Ha'il as part of the expansion of the Saudi railway system railway. A new SAR railway passenger station was completed in 2015. It is planned that commercial operation of this station will start in the fourth quarter of 2017 with trips to Riyadh. =Airport= Ha'il Regional Airport (IATA: HAS, ICAO: OEHL) is an airport offering both domestic and international flights, located to the southeast of Ha'il city. The airport is served by domestic carriers (Flynas, Nesma Airlines, and Saudia) and foreign carriers (Air Arabia, flydubai, and Nile Air). A new international airport was planned to be constructed near Ha'il city, in the Prince Abdulaziz Bin Mousaed Economic City (PABMEC), as Ha'il has a strategic location in the Middle East because it takes only one hour by plane to reach 11 Arab capitals.

Rosenthal and co-written with Bruce Rubin. The film stars Scott Baio as a high school student who acquires telekinetic powers. Plot At Ralph Waldo Emerson High School, bookish student Barney Springboro (Scott Baio) performs various scientific experiments on laboratory mice until his friend, yearbook photographer Peyton Nichols (Willie Aames), retrieves him for a class assembly. Peyton questions Barney's lack of interest in finding a girlfriend as the students rally in preparation for an upcoming baseball game against a rival high school. Afterward, Peyton seduces one of the school administrators, Corinne Updike, and Barney returns to his experiments. At the insistence of the pesky class president, Bernadette (Felice Schachter), Peyton promises to take photographs of Barney posing with the genetically modified orchids he has been growing for the school principal, Walter Coolidge. Barney drops the beaker containing the mice's feeding solution, producing a cloud of shimmery smoke that knocks him unconscious. Sometime later, he awakens and returns home, where his uptight mother chastises him for his tardiness and antisocial behavior. As she yells, Barney's bedroom door mysteriously slams shut. During English class the next day, Barney fantasizes about a popular but vain girl named Jane Mitchell (Heather Thomas). When the teacher calls on him unexpectedly, Barney furrows his brow, causing the map above the chalkboard to fall on her head. That afternoon, Peyton asks Jane on a date, but she reminds him that she has a college-aged boyfriend. As Barney stares at Jane's chest, her cardigan bursts open, leaving everyone confused. In the lab, Barney experiments with his new telekinetic abilities by levitating various objects across the room, unaware of Bernadette and Peyton, who are watching through the window. When his friends confront him, however, Barney convinces them to keep his powers a secret. At home, Barney propels his model spaceship through the air, imagining the crew members inside have come alive. He then animates a ventriloquist dummy, which frightens Mrs. Springboro so much that she believes her son is possessed. On the day of the big baseball game, Barney manipulates the ball and hits the winning home run. Meanwhile, Principal Coolidge attempts to break into Barney's lab to check the growth of his orchids, but cannot obtain the key. After Barney agrees to let Bernadette write a report about him for her older sister's college science journal, they notice Mrs. Burnhart sneak into his lab and uncover a pot of Peyton's marijuana hidden behind the orchids. She retrieves Principal Coolidge, but they return to discover the plants are missing. Baseball coach Dexter Jones finds Barney and Bernadette stuffing the plants in the incinerator, and the smoke causes him to become intoxicated: under the influence, he imagines riding a bicycle with Albert Einstein while being chased by his wife, who is dressed like a Viking warrior. Over the weekend, Barney, Peyton, and Bernadette go to a pre-graduation celebration at an amusement park, during which Peyton challenges Jane's boyfriend, Robert Wolcott, to a beer-drinking contest and a carnival games that Peyton ends up winning. While on the Tilt-a-Whirl, Barney increases the speed of Robert's compartment, causing him to vomit and lose the bet. That night, Peyton brings Jane home and seduces her by pretending to act older and more mature. Meanwhile, Barney and Bernadette have dinner and talk about former crushes. The pair spend the next afternoon together in the park before returning to Barney's lab, where they make love. At school on Monday, Jane admits that she regrets having sex with Peyton and returns to her boyfriend. Robert, however, invites Peyton to a casino-themed college fraternity party with the hopes of winning the money that he owes him for the drinking contest. Peyton begs Barney to attend so he can manipulate the roulette wheel, but Bernadette becomes angry that he would use his powers to gamble. Meanwhile, Mrs. Updike convinces Principal Coolidge to respond to a personal advertisement in the newspaper to meet a woman for a date. At the restaurant, Principal Coolidge discovers that his date is Rose Burnhart, and the two finally succumb to their long-time attraction by having sex under the table. During the fraternity party, Barney attempts to manipulate the roulette ball, but causes a commotion among the guests when he accidentally levitates the entire wheel. When Bernadette refuses to answer his telephone calls, he spends the night in his laboratory drinking whiskey. Hung over the next morning, he apologizes to Bernadette and arranges to meet her at the prom that evening. Before he leaves for the dance, however, Mrs. Springboro hires two priests to perform an exorcism on her son, and Barney uses his ventriloquist dummy to chase them around the house so he can get away. Peyton and Jane are crowned prom king and queen, and Jane rejects Peyton's continued advances. Peyton realize Jane is nothing but a snob, whatever he does is not good enough for her. As Barney dances with Bernadette, Peyton ruins the moment by offering his friend airplane tickets to Las Vegas where they can continue gambling, but Barney rejects the offer. When Robert confronts Peyton about the roulette game, Peyton apologizes and gives him a packet of nude photographs he took of Jane. Enraged, Robert attacks, and Barney uses telekinesis to summon a large gust of wind that tears off the students' clothes and sends everybody running outside. Barney also uses his telekinesis to take down Robert and his friends and humiliate Jane by stripping off her prom dress; as she is laughed at she runs away in shame. A wayward fire hose knocks Barney unconscious and he wakes up believing that he has lost his powers. However, while leaving the school, Barney grabs Bernadette by the waist and propels them through the night sky in a cloud of shimmery dust.

It was filmed largely at John Marshall High School in Los Angeles during the spring of 1981 with the students as extras. The storyline rarely leaves the high school. The students talk mostly about social life and college plans, while the prom is in the gym. The senior trip is to the local amusement park. Of the major stars, however, only Felice Schachter was still a high school student when the film was shot. In fact, she missed her own prom to shoot the prom sequence in the film.

Ludomił Antoni Korab Rayski. He served as the commander of the Polish Air Force between 1926 and 1939, being responsible for modernization of Polish military aviation. Throughout his life he also served in the Austro-Hungarian Army, Polish Legions, Turkish Army, S. Łątka, Lot ku gorzkiej sławie. Gen.

He was also known as one of the most colourful personalities of inter-war Poland - and one of its least submissive officers. Biography Early life = Ludomił Rayski was born 29 December 1892 in Czasław near Wieliczka, to Artur Teodor Rayski of Korab Coat of Arms, an impoverished Polish noble who spent most of his life as an officer in the Ottoman Army. Artur Teodor was born a Russian citizen, but was forced into exile following the January Uprising and was accepted as an Ottoman citizen soon afterwards. Hence Ludomił retained his father's citizenship, a fact that proved vital for his later career. Korab coat of arms In 1902 Ludomił joined a local gymnasium in Kraków and in 1909 passed his matura exams in a college in Krosno. Soon afterwards he started his studies at the Lwów University of Technology. In 1912 he also joined the Strzelec organization. After the outbreak of the Great War he volunteered for Piłsudski's Polish Legions, where he fought under command of Gen. Józef Kordian-Zamorski. Rayski was wounded in the battle of Łowczówek. After the Ottoman Empire joined the war on the side of Austria-Hungary, he was mobilized into the Ottoman Army. Rayski initially wanted to stay in the Legions, which were commonly seen as a school of cadre of future armed forces of Poland, but was convinced by Gen. Kordian-Zamorski to go to Constantinople and try to obtain experience in air warfare. =The Great War= In 1915 Rayski was accepted into the Turkish Air ForceLudomił Antoni Korab Rayski in: Polski Słownik Biograficzny, Tom XXX, Wrocław 1987, , pp. 273-276 and dispatched to the front and promoted to the rank of Observer. He served during the battle of Gallipoli, where he was seriously wounded. Upon his return from the hospital he was transferred to the Ottoman 5th Army based in Smyrna, where he was wounded for the second time. Upon return to service, on his own request he was sent to a fighter pilot training and earned his wings in the ranks of the Turkish Air Force. He served on various fronts of the war until its end. In January 1919 he was demobilized. Immediately afterwards he bought a single LVG C.V plane and flew across the Black Sea to Odessa, where he joined the Polish 4th Rifle Division under Gen. Lucjan Żeligowski. There he was made the commanding officer of that division's improvised air escadrille, equipped with 9 planes (apart from Rayski's LVG these were a single Nieuport 11C1 and eight Anatra Anasal DS). After a brief period of struggles against the Bolsheviks alongside Denikin's Whites, the unit was withdrawn to Poland. At that time the newly reborn Polish army was badly lacking experienced pilots. Although the Polish forces managed to seize dozens of World War I planes from the defeated Central Powers, there were not enough pilots to fly them. Because of that, immediately after Rayski's arrival to Poland in June 1919, he was made the commanding officer of newly formed 10th Reconnaissance Escadrille, composed mostly of the former escadrille of the 4th Division. A skilled pilot and commander, after the escalation of the Polish-Bolshevik War and during the final stages of the Polish-Ukrainian War, in August of that year he became the commanding officer of the most famous Polish air unit of the time, the 7th Kościuszko Air Escadrille. Rayski was chosen as the commander of that unit not only for his skills as a pilot, but also for his language abilities, as the squadron was manned primarily with American volunteers. He served with that unit on the front until January 1920. Three months afterwards he was promoted to the rank of Major and given a new assignment: command of a newly formed 21st Air Escadrille. Although composed mostly of badly trained pilots and insufficiently manned, the unit proved to be one of the most successful air units of the war and during the battle of Warsaw Rayski was given command of the entire 3rd Air Squadron. He held that post until May 1921. =Commander of the Polish Air Force= After the war Rayski remained in the military. Promoted to the rank of Lt. Colonel, he briefly became the commanding officer of the Higher Pilot's School at Poznań's airfield of Ławica. However, he gave up that post in 1922 and instead returned to Lwów, where he continued his studies halted 8 years before. He also remained an active aviator and gained much fame in Poland after several of his spectacular flights. In 1925 in four days he flew the Paris-Madrid-Casablanca- Tunis-Istanbul-Warsaw trail, a remarkable achievement at that time. In August 1924 he was promoted to the rank of Colonel and sent to a course for high- ranking officers at the Higher War School of Warsaw. At the same time he collaborated with the Aviation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, where he became the deputy to Gen. Armand Lévéque. On 18 March 1926, shortly before the May Coup d'État, he was made the chief of the department and a de facto commander of the Polish Air Force. At that post, Rayski became known as a supporter of the power projection doctrine and a lobbyist for development of a strong bomber force capable of both close air support and bombing raids on enemy territory. However, in the post-war period the Polish air forces were neglected as Marshal Józef Piłsudski and his predecessors underestimated the role of aeroplanes in modern warfare. Because of that, Rayski had to limit his plans to modernization of the fighter force Poland had at that time. Lack of funds, economic crisis and unwillingness to expand the air forces on the side of most of the high-ranking officers forced Rayski to focus on training of air crews instead. In that period he supported the famous Dęblin school of aviation (nicknamed the School of Eaglets in Poland) and creation of a number of permanent air bases, often with municipal rather than ministerial funds. It was Rayski to arrange the construction of a large number of new airfields and their number rose from 12 in 1923 to 39 in 1933, 11 of which were large air bases capable of supporting entire air regiments. The lack of funds shaped Rayski's policies significantly. Because Poland could not afford to purchase a large number of modern planes abroad, Rayski promoted the development of Polish aviation industry. In 1928 on his insistence all Polish aeroplane factories switched their production to modern all-metal constructions, which allowed the new generation of young and skilled engineers to start their career. Among them were Zygmunt Puławski (designer of a family of modern fighters, starting from PZL P.1), Jerzy Dąbrowski (designer of PZL.37 Łoś bomber), Wsiewołod Jakimiuk (designer of PZL.50 Jastrząb fighter), Stanisław Prauss (author of PZL.23 Karaś and PZL.46 Sum light bombers) and Stanisław Nowkuński (designer of air engines, among them the PZL Foka). The state-owned National Aviation Works (PZL) became the primary supplier of modern aeroplanes to the Polish Army and financed much of the plane production from its own sources, primarily gathered from export of planes to Romania, Spain, Hungary, Greece and Turkey. However, the constant lack of funds allowed the Polish Air Forces only to replace the old planes with more modern ones, but not to expand it to become a fully reliable part of the armed forces. Rayski repeatedly presented state authorities with plans and petitions of significant expansion of the Air Force, but none was accepted. In 1934 Ludomił Rayski was promoted to the rank of generał brygady, the highest rank held by any officer of the Polish Air Force at that time. Two years later, on 1 August 1936 he became the commander of the Polish Air Force. It was not until 1937 that one of his plans of modernization of the air force was finally accepted. The plan was based on extensive study of the development of the German Luftwaffe and on theories of Italian general Giulio Douhet, who envisioned that the future war would be fought primarily with bomber planes, with fighters playing a secondary role. In four years, by 1 April 1942, the number of Polish escadrilles was to be increased from 33 to 106. The plan was to be financed by the government and the entire reconstruction of the Polish Air Force was to cost approximately 1,537,000,000 złoty, that is almost 300 million US dollars or almost 62 million Pounds (by 1939 exchange rates). However, soon after the plan was passed, various conflicting groups within the general staff, as well as the financial difficulties of the newly reborn state have limited the plan. Out of 600 million złoty scheduled for the first phase of the reorganization of the Polish aviation only approximately 200 million were indeed spent, while the rest was kept by various ministries. Rayski's role was seriously undermined by lack of support within the general staff and his frequent protests and memorials made no effect. He signed his resignation twice (in March 1938 and then in January 1939), but it was not accepted. In January 1939, fearing that the war with Germany was imminent and inevitable, he resigned from his post and presented the minister of war affairs Gen. Tadeusz Kasprzycki with an ultimatum, urging him to finally mobilize the Polish air industry and dispatch all the funds. On 19 March 1939 he was dismissed from his office. Rayski's successor as the peacetime Air Force Commander became Gen. Władysław Kalkus, made personally subordinate to the Inspector of the Air Defence, Gen. Józef Zając, who was a strong supporter of the air superiority doctrine which emphasized strong fighter forces at the expense of a bomber force. The new commander of the air force cancelled most of Rayski's projects, including the successful PZL.37 Łoś bomber, whose production was to be limited from the initial number of 180 to merely 120. Some historians, most notably Jerzy Cynk, consider Rayski as one of the most responsible persons for the poor technical state of the Polish Air Force before the war, especially lack of modern fighters. It should be however noted, that a commanding system introduced by Piłsudski after his coup d'état was faulty, because it introduced two independent branches of command: peacetime and wartime one. The chief of the Aviation Department and commander of the Air Force was only a peacetime administrative duty, subordinated to the Ministry of War, while strategic planning was to be fulfilled by the wartime branch, the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces (GISZ), and general staff. The Inspectorate itself was not interested in military aviation much and was reluctant to work out a modern development plan for the Air Force and an appropriate strategic doctrine, giving only general directives instead. Therefore, Rayski had no knowledge on the Polish Air Force expected wartime role and as a result, he realized his own conception, without proper assessment of real needs. Only in 1936 the Air Defence Inspectorate was created, led by gen. Józef Zając, who became in conflict with Rayski. Jerzy B. Cynk, Dowodzenie Lotnictwem Wojskowym II Rzeczypospolitej in: Lotnictwo nr 5/2004 As one of mistakes is regarded support for too ambitious plan of equipping the LOT Polish Airlines with own modern airliner, the PZL.44 Wicher, what was uneconomical, and moreover, delayed development of modern fighters. In early 1930s Polish fighters of Zygmunt Puławski's design were among the best in the world, but in late 1930s the situation changed, and Rayski was reluctant to order development of successors (better versions of Pulawski's fighters, not restricted by the Polish Air Force choice of engines, were exported with a success). He promoted obsolete PZL.39 project, that was not realized, and the PZL.38 Wilk, a twin- engine heavy fighter-bomber, of a fashionable at that time class, but unable to substitute for interceptor aircraft. Future war showed, that modern single- engine interceptors were crucial aircraft for the air defence. Facing fiasco of both designs, Rayski finally ordered development of PZL.50 Jastrząb, which was hampered by his arbitrary choice of too weak engine, and appeared too late and mediocre. The other design was a low-performance light fighter PZL.45 project. Jerzy B. Cynk, Polskie lotnictwo wojskowe w okresie międzywojennym. Część IV in: Lotnictwo nr 11/2004 Other point of criticism was that Rayski, realizing his vision of strong national aerospace industry, intentionally caused bankruptcy of Plage i Laśkiewicz factory, while the DWL hardly avoided this fate. Until May Rayski remained without an assignment. He spent the time training on all types of Polish aeroplanes, from trainers to bombers. In July he was sent with a Polish military mission to the United Kingdom, where he was to coordinate the purchase of British planes for the Polish Air Force, as specified by the Anglo-Polish military alliance. However, the British authorities postponed the delivery of the Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire and Fairey Battle planes and on 15 July Rayski returned to Poland with little but promises. He continued to petition the general staff for any assignment, even an assignment to a combat unit in the role of a simple pilot, but to no avail. Finally on 25 August he was made the chief of army's administration. =World War II= After the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War on 1 September, Rayski was evacuated from Warsaw along with the rest of the Commander in Chief's staff. As the army's peace-time administration ceased to exist, he was given the task of evacuation of the gold reserves of the Bank of Poland. The gold convoyed out from Warsaw later became the crucial part of the treasury of the Polish Government in Exile. However, despite his constant pleas he was not allowed to join the fights and instead, after the Soviet invasion of Poland, on 18 September he crossed the border with Romania. Unlike most of the Polish general staff, Rayski managed to evade internment and made it to France, where he reported to Gen. Zając asking him for an assignment in the Polish Air Forces in France. His plea was yet again turned down as Rayski, along with other former high-ranking officers of the Polish Army, was made a scape-goat for the Polish defeat in the campaign. He then wrote a short memorial to all the Polish officers, in which he criticized the situation of the new commanders of the Polish Army in exile. Ordered to report to the military camp in Carisay, Rayski refused, for which he was court martialled and sentenced to 10 months in prison for insubordination. Although the sentence was never enacted, General Rayski was in fact demoted and left jobless. Rayski then volunteered for the French Armee de L'air, but was again turned down. Officially still a General of the Polish Army, he volunteered for the Finnish Air Force to take part in the Winter War. In early 1940 he bought a transport plane and on 7 March departed for Helsinki. However, on 12 March the Moscow Peace Treaty had been signed and Rayski's service for Finland was not needed any more. Upon his return to France he was demoted to the rank of Captain and on 29 March he joined the French Foreign Legion. On 1 June the Legion sent him to French Air Forces for training, but before it could commence France surrendered to Germany and Rayski fled to Great Britain. There, on 5 September he asked both the British authorities and Gen. Władysław Sikorski to be allowed to join the Royal Air Force as a simple pilot. However, instead on 27 September he was interned in an internment camp in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute in Scotland. On 5 November, on insistence of Air Chief Marshals Sir Cyril Newall and Charles Medhurst he was set free and in 1941 he was admitted to RAF Ferry Command units, transporting planes between allied airfields in Asia and North Africa. He led a variety of transport missions, including a remarkable flight of a formation of Bristol Blenheim bombers from Habaniya in Iraq to Singapore. After two weeks of flight, his bomber was destroyed by Japanese fighters immediately upon arrival to the attacked port. The tide turned for him after the death of General Sikorski on 4 July 1943. The new commander of the Polish forces, Gen. Kazimierz Sosnkowski allowed Rayski to return to active service. Promoted to the British rank of Air Vice- Marshal (in Polish rank system he remained a Captain), Rayski was made a delegate of the commander of the Polish Air Forces for the Middle East. At the same time Gen. Sosnkowski reviewed Rayski's court martial case and handed it to General's Court led by Admiral Jerzy Świrski. On 2 February 1944 the jury acquitted Rayski of all the charges and declared him not guilty. However, he was not promoted back to the Polish general's rank. During the Warsaw Uprising Rayski was probably the only allied General to fly combat missions on a daily basis. He volunteered for the service in No. 318 Polish Fighter-Reconnaissance Squadron and No. 301 Polish Bomber Squadron stationed in Brindisi, and flown a number of supply missions for the Armia Krajowa fighting in German-occupied Europe, both on Supermarine Spitfire and on B-24 Liberator. Altogether, during his entire service with the RAF, he flew a total of 1519 hours of combat missions. =After the war= After the war, Rayski remained in the Polish Army and then the Polish Liquidation Unit until 8 February 1949, when he was demobilized. He remained in the United Kingdom and settled in London's borough of Ealing, where he started to work as a plotter. He also remained an active member of the local Polish community and the honorary chief of the Polish Airmen Society. In 1966 he married his second wife, Eileen Sheedy. In early April 1977, Rayski - then already heavily sick and dying - was finally acquitted of all the charged presented to him in 1940 by an honorary commission of the Polish Government in Exile led by Gen. Zygmunt Szyszko- Bohusz. Ludomił Rayski died 11 April and was buried with his first wife in Newark. In May 1993 his ashes were buried with military honours in the Polish Army's Cathedral in Warsaw.

It is best known for its abundance of restaurants, cafes and shopping, which makes it a popular tourist attraction.  Geography  Bridge Road runs for 2 kilometres roughly east-to-west in the suburb of Richmond. The road is positioned from its crossroads with Hoddle Street and Wellington Parade in the west to its fork into Church Street and Burwood Road in the east. The City of Yarra town hall and Epworth Hospital are amongst the landmarks of Bridge Road. Hawthorn Bridge, which crosses the Yarra River, is also along Bridge Road.  History  Bridge Road is classified as a heritage area as its history dates back to 1837, two years after the European settlement of the colony of Victoria. The first land sales in the area took place on August 1, 1839. Historical plaques are placed on many buildings and provide a glimpse into the development of Bridge Road. The majority of the existing 19th-century buildings in Bridge Road are shops which date from the 1870s and 1880s. The horse-drawn omnibuses which brought shoppers to the area were replaced by cable trams in 1885, which in turn were replaced by an electrified tram service in 1916. Shortly afterwards Cinema Richmond opened in 1919 adjacent to the Town Hall.  Tram Routes  Tram routes 48 and 75 pass through Bridge Road.

The first example of plug compatible IBM subsystems were tape drives and controls offered by Telex beginning 1965. Memorex in 1968 was first to enter the IBM plug-compatible disk followed shortly thereafter by a number of suppliers such as CDC,\\"Expected to produce $1 billion in revenues during fiscal 1980, CDC's peripherals business, advancing at 33% annually, is the fastest growing revenue producer within the company's diverse product line.\\" Itel, and Storage Technology Corporation.

This has given the ability to replace unreliable CDC tape drives and controllers and overpriced CDC disk drives and controllers with their IBM plug-compatible counterparts.\\" Ultimately plug- compatible products were offered for most peripherals and system main memory. PCM and computer systems A plug-compatible machine is one that has been designed to be backward compatible with a prior machine. In particular, a new computer system that is plug-compatible has not only the same connectors and protocol interfaces to peripherals, but also binary-code compatibility—it runs the same software as the old system. A plug compatible manufacturer or PCM is a company that makes such products. One recurring theme in plug-compatible systems is the ability to be bug compatible as well. That is, if the forerunner system had software or interface problems, then the successor must have (or simulate) the same problems. Otherwise, the new system may generate unpredictable results, defeating the full compatibility objective. Thus, it is important for customers to understand the difference between a \\"bug\\" and a \\"feature\\", where the latter is defined as an intentional modification to the previous system (e.g. higher speed, lighter weight, smaller package, better operator controls, etc.). =PCM and IBM mainframes= The original example of PCM mainframes was the Amdahl 470 mainframe computer which was plug-compatible with the IBM System 360 and 370, costing millions of dollars to develop. Similar systems were available from Comparex, Fujitsu,\\"LEAD: Beating I.B.M. to the punch by one day, Fujitsu Ltd. announced a series of computers today that ...\\" and Hitachi. Not all were large systems.\\"A 3200 system can include up to 16M bytes, with virtual memory freeing programmers from artificial memory constraints.

For example, a plug-compatible cooling fan may need to have not only the same physical size and shape, but also similar capability, run from the same voltage, use similar power, attach with a standard electrical connector, and have similar mounting arrangements. Some non-conforming units may be re- packaged or modified to meet plug-compatible requirements, as where an adapter plate is provided for mounting, or a different tool and instructions are supplied for installation, and these modifications would be reflected in the bill of materials for such components. Similar issues arise for computer system interfaces when competitors wish to offer an easy upgrade path. In general, plug-compatible systems are designed where industry or de facto standards have rigorously defined the environment, and there is a large installed population of machines that can benefit from third-party enhancements. Plug compatible does not mean identical replacement. However, nothing prevents a company from developing follow-on products that are backward-compatible with its own early products.

Using the same game engine and principles of Caesar III (also by Sierra Entertainment), it is the first such game in Sierra's City Building series to focus on another civilization of ancient times. Players oversee the construction and management of cities and settlements in Ancient Egypt, micro-managing every aspect of the city to ensure citizens are fed, employed, healthy and protected from diseases, disasters and wars. An expansion pack, Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile, was released in 2000 by BreakAway Games. In 2001, both the game and expansion pack were bundled together as Pharaoh Gold. In August 2020, a remake titled Pharaoh: A New Era was announced by Triskell Interactive and Dotemu to be released in 2021. Gameplay Pharaoh is played from a two-dimensional isometric perspective; the magnification level is fixed, but the viewing angle can be changed at 90-degree angles, either counter-clockwise or clockwise. Much of the control is managed through the mouse and keyboard shortcuts, in an interface system similar to that of Caesar III. Many buttons exist for different types of construction like housing and roads, viewing messages, undoing mistakes, cycling through trouble spots, a map of Ancient Egypt and the surrounding regions, a group of advisors (called Overseers) who provide information on the city's development and any problems encountered, and in-game overlays that detail issues and the fulfillment of housing's demands. All aspects of city life, such as housing, religion, warfare and trade, are designed carefully to closely reflect that of actual Ancient Egyptian cities of the time, including the goods and services available. Names of various pharaohs are used with the appearance of historical characters from Egypt's ancient history, and limited encyclopedic information about ancient Egyptian practices is provided in the game's help menu and instruction booklet. While the game uses the deben as its currency, no standardized metal currency is known to have been used in Ancient Egypt. Although the puzzle-like aspect of Pharaoh keeps the simulation far from realistic, the game stays true to the chronological order and timing of major events in the history of Egypt, including monument construction, wars and national disasters, the births and deaths of notable leaders, and the founding and fall of ancient cities. =Game modes= The game features two modes of play – campaign and free-build. In campaign mode, players focus on establishing cities during different periods of Ancient Egypt, initially working on nomad settlements, before being entrusted with building up trade centres, grand cities and monuments for various Ancient Egyptian leaders. As campaign mode progresses, players earn promotions until they become the Pharaoh themselves. Players operate in five periods of Ancient Egyptian history (six with the inclusion of Cleopatra), with the first period acting as a basic tutorial. In later periods, players get a choice between two missions, usually peaceful and military alternatives, but only one of the two needs to be completed to move on in the campaign. In free-build mode, players are given a choice of around a dozen standalone scenarios. Some do not have win conditions, allowing open-ended \\"sandbox\\" city-building, whereas others present goals to attain. A map editor is provided with the game to facilitate the creation of user-designed scenarios for this mode. 260x260px =Gameplay elements= Pharaoh simulates many aspects of Egyptian life and city management. While many of the elements of the game, from housing to industry, are borrowed from Caesar III, the game distinguishes itself with differences and new features. For example, after housing plots are designated, immigrants can move into them and build their residences. Housing will automatically be improved, including in appearance, when demands for goods, services and desirable surroundings are fulfilled. While Population, Prosperity and Culture are retained in the game, Favor is renamed as \\"Kingdom\\" and maintains the same function in that the score is based upon the ruling Pharaoh's view on a player's performance. Peace is replaced with a new goal, \\"Monument\\", which focuses on a player's efforts to establish the monuments needed within their city; players will usually be given the knowledge of the monuments they need to build during a briefing of their next mission. In terms of farming, floodplain farms are a new feature built near the Nile River. A further addition is the use of Irrigation Ditches to increase the fertility of farmland. Fishers operate in boats, usually situated in the Nile. Hunting is a new feature in Pharaoh; animals to be hunted are present on the game map. A wide variety of raw materials and manufactured goods are available in Pharaoh. Materials include clay, which is manufactured into pottery; reeds, which are manufactured into papyrus; and various types of stone. Both raw materials and goods can be traded with other cities in exchange for currency. On some city maps, the raw materials necessary to produce certain goods are unavailable, so importing sometimes expensive materials is necessary. Exports are often necessary to produce money for city finances. Much like the Senate building of Caesar III, the palace operates as the main treasury of the city. While architects operate out of their own building like Caesar III, fire and crime prevention are done by two separate buildings and walkers – firehouses and fire marshals, and police stations and constables. Players may also build Courthouses. Another new feature to the series, monuments from Ancient Egyptian history can be built on a variety of missions. Such projects require various worker facilities and building materials and, unlike most other buildings, take time to be built. The game has five gods to appease, who each focus on a different aspect of the city – Ra (the kingdom), Bast (the home), Osiris (agriculture), Ptah (industry) and Seth (warfare). Each city is given one or several of the gods to worship: one is the patron god of the city, while the others are local deities. Players can construct shrines, temples or temple complexes to appease the gods. Like in Caesar III, the gods bestow gifts when they are appeased and disasters when they are angered, depending on their focus; for example, Osiris can improve the flooding of the Nile and increase crop yields, but can also decrease the quality of the Nile's annual flooding. Fighting Egypt's enemies is a secondary element of the game. Pharaoh features three different unit types: infantry, archers and chariot riders. A player's city can be attacked by enemy forces, usually multiple times over the course of a mission. Troops can also be sent to help fellow Egyptian armies in battles outside the city. A new feature to Pharaoh is naval combat. Players have access to two types of ships – transports, which ferry ground troops across water, and warships, which fight enemy ships that arrive in the region. The game also leaves out certain aspects from Caesar III, such as large bridges and inability to traverse large bodies of water other than by ferry. ReceptionCritical reception= Daniel Erickson reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Pyramid building and floodplain management come together for a brilliant city builder.\\" Pharaoh garnered mainly positive reviews, with an average rating of 82.45% on GameRankings. =Sales= In the German market, Pharaoh debuted at #4 on Media Control's computer game sales charts in the second half of November 1999. It had spent six weeks in the top rankings by the end of the year, with a fifth-place finish in December. The following year, Pharaoh continued at #5 in January and secured sixth for February. In April 2000, the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) presented the game with a \\"Gold\\" award, indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It remained in Media Control's top 10 by August 2000, and in the top 20 through November. By that time, Pharaoh had held in the firm's top 30 for 13 months. Pharaoh became a worldwide hit. According to MeriStation, its combined global sales with Caesar III surpassed 1 million units by July 2000. Expansion pack Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile cover art The game was complemented with an expansion pack called Cleopatra: Queen of the Nile, developed by BreakAway Games the following year, which extended the game's main campaign into the Hellenistic period. Both the original game and expansion pack are commonly referred to, and may be purchased as one, under the title Pharaoh and Cleopatra. Remake A remake titled Pharaoh: A New Era was announced in August 2020 by Triskell Interactive and Dotemu to be released in 2021. This remake will feature new code for modern computer systems and an updated user interface, as well as new gameplay modes including a sandbox mode, but will include the campaign modes from both Pharaoh and the Cleopatra expansion.

An airbox is an empty chamber on the inlet of most combustion engines. It collects air from outside and feeds it to the intake hoses of each cylinder. Older engines drew air directly from the surroundings into each individual carburetor. Modern engines instead draw air into an airbox, which is connected by individual hoses to each carburetor or directly to the intake ports in fuel-injected engines, thus avoiding an extra intake manifold.Greg Banish: Engine Management: Advance Tuning; Cartech Inc; The airbox allows the use of one air filter instead of multiples, reducing complexity. Developments arising from concerns about environmental effects during the late 1970s allow the airbox to collect pump gases from the crankcase and the tank air vent and re- feed them to the engine.  Developments  Since the 1990s, engine designers also sought to exploit the properties of oscillating gas to improve performance. Many high-performance motorcycles have the airbox fed from funnels in the front of the bike, where increased pressure forces more air into the intake and thus improves power. Examples for this ram-air intake construction are the SRAD models of the Suzuki GSX-R750, the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R or the BMW S1000RR. Secondly, designers exploit a property of air cavities known as Helmholtz resonance. Flow through the airbox is optimal at its resonance frequency, which depends on airbox volume and the inlet area and length of the snorkel. The resonance is typically chosen to be at a medium speed where torque otherwise drops, caused by valve timing overlap.Resonant airboxes: Theory and Applications, Mark Lawrence, requested February 5, 2016 References Category:Engine fuel system technology ","title":"Airbox"},{"id":"2466838","text":"The green beret was the headgear of the British Commandos of World War II.

Subsequently, he published Mémoires du roi Joseph (1853–1855), and, as a sequel, Histoire des négotiations diplomatiques relatives aux traits de Morfontaine, de Lunéville et d'Amiens, together with the unpublished correspondence of the emperor Napoleon I with Cardinal Fesch (1855–1856). From papers in the possession of the imperial family he compiled Mémoires du prince Eugene (1858–1860) and Réfutation des Mémoires du duc de Raguse (1857), part of which was inserted by authority at the end of volume ix of the Mémoires. He was attached to Jerome's son, Prince Napoleon, during the Crimean War, and wrote a Précis historique des operations militaires en Orient, de mars 1854 a octobre 1855 (1857), which was completed many years later by a volume entitled La Crimée et Sebastopol de 1853 a 1856, docusnentl intiines et indits, followed by the complete list of the French officers killed or wounded in that war (1892). He was also employed by Prince Napoleon on the Correspondence of Napoleon I, and afterwards published certain letters, purposely omitted there, in the Revue historique. These documents, subsequently collected in Les Rois fréres de Napoleon (1883), as well as the Journal de la reine Catherine de Westphalie (1893), were edited with little care and are not entirely trustworthy, but their publication threw much light on Napoleon I and his entourage. His Souvenirs d'un officier du le Zouaves, and Les Dessous du coup d'état (1891), contain many piquant anecdotes, but at times degenerate into mere tittle-tattle. Ducasse was the author of some slight novels, and from the practice of this form of literature he acquired that levity which appears even in his most serious historical publications.

It was published by SCEI in Japan and Activision worldwide. Unlike its predecessor, Alundra, Alundra 2 features a 3D look which opens up a new world of puzzles. Also, despite its title, Alundra 2 is a standalone sequel, and has no ties with the original. It has a whole new story with a different set of characters, including the main character, Flint. Compared to the darker storyline of Alundra, Alundra 2 has a more light-hearted storyline.  Gameplay  Alundra 2 is an action role-playing game that has the environment in 3D, the character can be moved in all directions, and the camera can be manually rotated 360 degrees. Gameplay consists of fighting enemies, interacting with character NPCs, puzzle solving, platforming, and exploration. The story is presented through text and voiced cutscenes. The player controls Flint, a young swordsman and silent protagonist. Flint uses a sword to fight enemies and he carries a shield which gives passive damage reduction; stronger versions of both are obtainable throughout the game. Flint can also learn additional successive strikes for his sword, known as combos, by collecting items called Puzzle Pieces and exchanging them with the character Lord Jeehan. The game also features unique magical ring items which grant Flint special powers such as the abilities to float in place or traverse over harmful lava.  Story  Alundra 2's story is set in the kingdom of Varuna. Mephisto, a powerful sorcerer is using magical wind-up keys to control humans and turn animals into mindless, violent machines. Flint is a pirate hunter wanted for treason, and he is after the pirates that caused his parents' death. The game begins with Flint infiltrating a flying airship. Inside, he finds the ship is staffed by humanoid robots; there are conspicuous keys protruding from their backs and their speech is unintelligible. Also on board is a family of three pirates: Zeppo, Albert, and Ruby. Flint eavesdrops on their conversation and it is mentioned that Mephisto can create \\"mechanical men\\" through a technology that only he understands. Baron Diaz, untrusting of Mephisto, tasks the pirates with keeping an eye on him. Flint is discovered and attacked by Zeppo. The resulting battle damages the interior of the ship and causes it to crash. Flint falls into the sea and washes onto a shore where he is found by a villager and taken in. After recovering, he meets Princess Alexia and joins forces with her. Alexia explains that her father is missing and she knows that Baron Diaz used the pirates to get rid of him. In their search for incriminating proof, Flint and Alexia encounter Mephisto, battle with his mechanical abominations, and investigate the suspicious \\"Church of the Key\\". They are eventually detained by Mephisto and taken by sea to Varuna. Flint is thrown overboard, but he survives and reaches the capital to confront Baron Diaz. The Baron threatens Alexia's life and tasks Flint with retrieving three relics in exchange for her safety. Flint is told to enlist the help of the three pirates he had met before: Zeppo, Albert, and Ruby. They assist him in entering the ruins. Flint goes through the ruins and does battle with their ancient guardians to obtain the three relics. Flint returns to Baron Diaz and delivers the relics, and the Baron uses them to enter a tower in search of the lost treasure of Varuna. Mephisto follows the Baron inside and reads a mural on a wall. He explains that there are a set of instructions on the mural and that yet another relic is required before the instructions can be completed. Flint is ordered to retrieve a fourth relic and he battles through more dungeons in search of the relic. Along the way, he meets an enslaved dragon named Tirion. Flint frees him and the dragon flies him back to Varuna. After Flint returns the final relic, it is set in place and the machinery of the tower is activated. Mephisto reveals that there isn't a lost treasure of Varuna and that he had built the tower two thousand years ago in order to calculate the coordinates of the nerve-center of the planet. A wizard named Lumiere, however, prevented Mephisto from entering by sealing the tower. Mephisto then inserts a key into the Baron, turning him into a mechanical monster. After Flint defeats the monster, Baron Diaz returns to normal. Outside of the capital, Mephisto raises his Star Key, a giant key-shaped structure, out of the sea. His intention is to use its power to mutate the planet and take control. Tirion flies Flint, Alexia, Zeppo, Albert, and Ruby to the Star Key to confront Mephisto. Flint makes his way through the dungeon and he finds that Zeppo has been captured. Mephisto appears and inserts a key into Zeppo, also turning him into a mechanical monster. Flint defeats the monster, returning Zeppo to his former state, and then faces Mephisto in battle. Flint kills Mephisto and the Star Key collapses into the sea. The group escapes on the back of Tirion; Flint and Alexia share an embrace as they fly away.  Reception  The game received an average score of 69.32% at GameRankings, based on an aggregate of 25 reviews. Japanese magazine Famitsu gave the game a score of 28 out of 40. IGN gave Alundra 2 a score of 7.7 out of 10. After praising its predecessor Alundra as \\"one of the PlayStation's best action/RPGs\\" and its storyline as \\"one of the darkest storylines of any role-playing games in existence,\\" the reviewer stated that Alundra 2 \\"just doesn't stack up\\" and that, \\"even though the writing was exceptional, it didn't make up for the fact that the game had a really fruity storyline.\\" However, he stated that he enjoyed \\"the game's puzzles and was very impressed with the localization job by Activision,\\" but that \\"the game was really hurt by its less than precise controls, annoyingly difficult boss battles,\\" \\"uninspiring music, and graphical glitches.\\" He concluded that, \\"pretend that this has nothing to do with the original Alundra or Zelda, and you'll probably enjoy this game just fine. It's definitely one of the top five action/RPGs on the PlayStation.\\" GameSpot was very critical of the game, giving it just a 4/10. GameRevolution gave it a C. EuroGamer gave it a 60/100. Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"A pretty standard RPG story gussied up with well-designed action puzzles, terrific graphics, and a huge world. Very nice.\\"  References  External links  * Category:1999 video games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Activision games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Matrix Software games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation (console)-only games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Alundra 2"},{"id":"2466872","text":"Alexander Yakovlevich Gomelsky (; 18 January 1928 – 16 August 2005) was a Soviet and Russian professional basketball player and coach.YIVO  Sport: Jews in Sport in the USSR .

Biography George Dunbar was born in 1777 at Coldingham in Berwickshire.Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871 In early life he was a gardener, however having been permanently injured by an accident, he instead chose to study the classics. At about the age of 30 he moved to Edinburgh, and from 1800 to 1805 worked as a tutor to the family of Lord Provost Sir William Fettes. In 1806 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1807, Dunbar succeeded Andrew Dalzell as Professor of Greek at the University of Edinburgh, having acted as Dalzell's assistant for many years. Dunbar held his appointment until his death on 6 December 1851. In the 1830s his address is given as Rose Park, Edinburgh. He died at his home Rose Park in Trinity in north Edinburghhttps://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf on 6 December 1851. He is buried with his wife, Barbara Augusta Hamilton, in the western extension of Greyfriars Kirkyard on the western path. Professor Alexander Christison is buried in the same plot. Assessment Although a man of great energy and industry, Dunbar did not produce anything of permanent value. He deserves mention, however, for his Greek-English and English-Greek lexicon (1840), on the compilation of which he spent eight years. Although now superseded, it was the best work of its kind that had appeared in the United Kingdom. References ;Attribution * Endnote: **Caledonian Mercury (8 December 1851).

First introduced on December 15, 1979, its high level of detail and realism make it one of the most sought-after vintage R/C models today. Topped with a highly detailed plastic replica of a Volkswagen Baja Bug, the Sand Scorcher shared many parts with an earlier car, the \\"Rough Rider\\". Released a little over a month apart, both cars were constructed from components that were mostly metal, rather than plastic. Though heavy, this meant the Sand Scorcher was extremely rugged. Adding to the model's detail was its suspension system which was closely patterned after that of a full-scale Volkswagen. All on board electronics were protected by a water-resistant clear plastic case, meaning the car could be driven through water without damage - a feat very few modern R/C vehicles can perform. Of interest to both R/C and VW enthusiasts, mint-in-box examples of the Sand Scorcher command prices from US$2900 to US$5100 as certain original parts for this model are nearly impossible to find in brand new condition. The basic body shell was also used in two other Tamiya models, namely the Monster Beetle and the Blitzer Beetle, making it Tamiya's longest-running R/C body shell design. However the original Sand Scorcher edition of the body can be identified by the wider fenders, the separate door handles and the words \\"1/10 RC VW BUGGY\\" moulded into the inside of the roof. Later versions lack this detail, making the original version highly sought after by collectors. Tamiya released a 30th Anniversary edition of the Sand Scorcher in March 2010, with only slight modifications to the original design including some die-cast parts and an ESC in place of the mechanical speed controller. Popular culture The Tamiya Sand Scorcher appears in the 1986 Australian film \\"Malcolm\\", an award-winning comedy about a socially awkward young man living in Melbourne who becomes involved in a series of robberies, and who also happens to have a keen interest in hobbies. In one scene in the film, Malcolm uses his Sand Scorcher to fetch bottles of milk from a nearby convenience store, without leaving the comfort of his home. In another scene he attaches a trailer, camera and a gun to the car, and by remotely controlling the car via the camera, uses it to hold up two security guards at a bank and steal a bag full of money.

He served as Commanding Officer (CO) of the first American paratroop unit to jump into combat, the 2nd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, near Oran as part of Operation Torch during World War II.Atkinson, Rick. An Army at Dawn. New York, New York: Henry Holt & Company. pp. 89-90. His book, We Jumped to Fight, was based on his experience in that operation and was published in 1944. BiographyEarly life and military career= Raff had served as First Captain of Cadets at a small prep school in Winchester, Virginia, called the Shenandoah Valley Academy, before serving in the army. He graduated from the United States Military Academy (USMA) in 1933 as a second lieutenant into the Infantry Branch of the United States Army. =World War II= By the time the United States entered World War II in December 1941, Raff had transferred to the army's fledgling airborne forces. Serving as Commanding Officer (CO) of the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment, a paratrooper unit, commanded by Colonel William M. \\"Bud\\" Miley, Raff's battalion (which was later redesignated the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion) was sent to England as an independent unit as part of Operation Roundup, the Allied invasion of German- occupied Europe scheduled for 1942 which, due to lack of resources, was postponed until 1943. While in England the 509th trained alongside and became closely associated with the British 1st Airborne Division, commanded by Major General Frederick A. M. \\"Boy\\" Browning, the father of the British Army's airborne forces. Due to the tough training course he gave the paratroopers in the 509th (and his stocky physique), Raff was nicknamed \\"Little Caesar\\" by his paratroopers.Military.com Content\\"Good God. Gaston\\" Time Oct 12, 1942 He first saw combat in November 1942 in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, as the commander of the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion: On 13 November 1942, Raff led the 2nd Battalion, 509th Parachute Regiment in an airborne assault on the Youks-les-Bains airfield in Algeria meeting friendly and cooperative French forces. Raff then also captured Tebessa airfield. On 17 November, Raff led a small reconnaissance patrol that captured Gafsa, Tunisia and made contact with the friendly French Chasseurs d'Afrique Regiment and defenses were prepared around the airfield there. On 21 November, in the face of a German attack Raff destroyed the large aviation fuel dump at Gafsa and withdrew to Tebessa. Reinforced by a squadron of P-38s, Company I of the 2/509th and the 3rd Battalion Anti-tank Platoon, 26th Infantry as well as Company B, 701st Tank Destroyer Battalion Raff counterattacked and quickly recaptured Gafsa from a small German paratroop unit. Raff then attacked south towards El Guettar destroying a small Axis tank force. On 23 November, Raff attacked north to Ferriana then Sbietla, destroying 12 enemy tanks and taking nearly 100 prisoners, mostly Italians. Raff was promoted to full colonel on 27 November 1942.Butcher,Harry C. Captain USNR. My Three Years with Eisenhower, p. 205. By 1 December, Raff's command was dubbed the \\"Tunisian Task Force\\" (also known as \\"Raff's Army\\")Mayo, Lida. The Ordnance Department: On Beachhead And Battlefront. Center Of Military History, United States Army, Washington, D.C., 1991. p. 129. and reinforced by the US 3rd Battalion, 26th Infantry and most of 2nd Battalion, 509th Parachute Battalion was withdrawn. On 2 December, Raff launched an attack with E Company 2nd Bn 509th Parachute Infantry, an anti-tank platoon, 3rd Battalion, 26th Infantry (detached from the 1st Infantry Division), B Company 701st Tank Destroyer Battalion, the French Chasseurs de Afrique, a French artillery unit and a company of Algerian Tirailleurs. The force captured the strategic Faid Pass on 3 December along with 120 enemy troops. The defense of the pass was turned over to the French, and the Task Force went into reserve at Sidi-Bou-Zid on 5 December and on 12 December withdrew further to Ferriana as a mobile reserve.Billings, Linwood W.

He spent time as an airborne planner on Lieutenant General Omar Bradley's staff and was assigned by Major General Ridgway to lead Task Force Raff, a composite unit of M4 Sherman tanks and scout cars landed at Utah Beach on D-Day, 6 June 1944, to support the 82nd Airborne Division in the American airborne landings in Normandy.Nordyke, Phil. All American, All the Way. Zenith Imprint, 2005. pg. 310. , When the 82d Airborne Division Chief of Staff was injured, Raff was named temporary replacement and when the commander of the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) was captured in Normandy, Raff was assigned, on June 15, 1944, to command of the regiment.Clay Blair, Ridgway's Paratroopers, Garden City, NY:Dial Press, 1985. pg. 337. He led the 507th, nicknamed \\"Raff's Ruffians\\", through the rest of the war, during the Battle of the Bulge in January 1945 and Operation Varsity in March 1945. After the regiment returned from Normandy in July 1944, due to a dispute between Raff and Major General Ridgway, the division commander, along with Brigadier General James M. Gavin, the Assistant Division Commander (ADC), Raff's 507th Parachute Infantry was transferred to the 17th Airborne Division, commanded by Major General William Miley, Raff's old regimental commander. As the plane neared the drop zone (DZ) during Operation Varsity, Raff recalled:A Legend Raff led the regiment in the Western Allied invasion of Germany until the end of World War II in Europe came less than two months later on May 8, 1945, Victory in Europe Day (VE Day). =Postwar= After the war, in 1954, Raff would command the 77th Special Forces Group, based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and is credited by Lieutenant General William Yarborough (who had served under Raff with the 509th in North Africa) as the \\"father\\" of the then- controversial green beret now routinely worn by U.S. Army Special Forces. Raff retired from the army in 1958. He died on March 11, 2003, at 95 years old.

According to the Language and Literature Bureau of Brunei, the Kedayan language (ISO 639-3: kxd) is spoken by about 30,000 people in Brunei,Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka Brunei (2006). Kamus Kedayan-Melayu Melayu-Kedayan. Berakas: Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka Brunei, p. xi. and it has been claimed that there are a further 46,500 speakers in Sabah and 37,000 in Sarawak. In Sabah the Kedayan mainly live in the cities of Sipitang, Beaufort, Kuala Penyu and Papar. In Sarawak the Kedayans mostly reside in Lawas, Limbang, Miri and the Subis area. The Kedayan people are also regarded as a sub-ethnic group of the Klemantan Dayak people.  History  A Kedayan man, standing underneath a rice barn. The origins of the Kedayans are uncertain. Some of them believe their people were originally from Java, which they left during the reign of Sultan Bolkiah. Because of his fame as a sea captain and voyager, the Sultan was well-known to the people of Java, Sumatra and the Philippines. It is believed that when the Sultan arrived to the island of Java, he became interested in the local agricultural techniques. He brought some of the Javanese farmers back to his country to spread their techniques. The farmers inter-married with the local Bruneian Malay people, giving birth to the Kedayan ethnicity. Most Kedayans have adopted Islam since the Islamic era of the Sultanate of Brunei. They have also adopted Malay culture. The Kedayans are recognized as one of the indigenous people of Borneo. They are experts in making traditional medicines. The Kedayans are well known for their cultivation of medicinal plants, which they grow to treat a wide range of ailments and to make tonics. The language of one of the indigenous tribes, the Banjar people in Kutai, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, is said to share more than 90% of the vocabulary with the Kedayan language, despite the fact that the Banjarese do not refer to themselves as Kedayans. Both the Kedayans and the Banjarese are related, to a certain extent, because of the similarities in their languages.  Language  The Kedayan language is similar to Brunei Malay, and it has been claimed that as many as 94% of the words in the two languages are cognate.Nothofer, B. (1991).

After its creators reacquired the rights to the series, it was re-released on Good Old Games on July 2, 2009. It was re-released in 2009 on Gog.com for Windows and in 2012 for macOS, and then released on Steam in 2014 with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Plot Like all Tex Murphy games, The Pandora Directive takes place in post-World War III San Francisco in April 2043. After the devastating events of WWIII, many major cities have been rebuilt (as is the case with New San Francisco), though certain areas still remain as they were before the war (as in Old San Francisco). WWIII also left another mark on the world: the formation of two classes of citizens. Specifically, the Mutants and the Norms. After the events of Under a Killing Moon, tensions between the two groups have begun to diminish. The end to the Crusade for Genetic Purity was a turning point in the relations between Mutants and \\"Norms\\". Tex still lives on Chandler Ave., which recently underwent a city-funded cleanup. The events of WWIII still left the planet with no ozone layer, and to protect their citizens many countries adopted a time reversal. Instead of sleeping at night, and being awake in the day, humans have become nocturnal, in a manner of speaking. Though Tex lives in what is considered a Mutant area of town, he himself is a \\"Norm\\". In The Pandora Directive, after accidentally offending his love interest Chelsee Bando, Tex (Chris Jones) is hired by Gordon Fitzpatrick (Kevin McCarthy) to find his friend, Thomas Malloy (John Agar). He learns that Malloy stayed at the Ritz, and decides to follow up the lead after reconciling with Chelsee and agreeing to go for dinner with her at her apartment. Upon investigating Malloy's room, Tex is knocked out by a mysterious masked figure dressed in black. Tex is out through the night, inadvertently missing his date with Chelsee. After finding out that a female acquaintance of Malloy works at the Fuchsia Flamingo club, Tex offers to take Chelsee there to both apologise and hopefully to check out the lead. Regardless of whether Chelsee comes out with Tex or not, she will decide to take a vacation to Phoenix for a few days. At the club, Tex meets with the girl, Emily who agrees to trade information on Malloy if Tex can find out who is stalking her. She gives a note she received from her stalker to Tex and upon showing it to his connection in the police station Mac Malden, Tex finds out that Emily is being observed by the Black Arrow Killer. Tex is able to discover that the NSA is involved and looking for Malloy, and breaks into one of their headquarters, Autotech. He finds out that the NSA are using video surveillance to monitor the goings on in Emily's room at the Fuchsia Flamingo. Tex finds the source of this and sees a figure dresses similarly to the person who attacked him in Malloy's room waiting to confront Emily. Tex hurries over to the club and is able to get there just in time to see the Killer jump out of the window carrying a small box. (Whether Emily survives or not will depend on the storyline path.) Tex chases him down and in the ensuing fight accidentally causes the Killer to fall off the roof and die. Tex removes the Killer's mask and sees that it is NSA agent Dag Horton, who had an office in Autotech. Tex is pulled in for questioning by the police, but is allowed to leave when an unknown woman enters the station and speaks to Mac. Tex retrieves the box that Horton stole from Emily's room, but is seized by the NSA and taken to Jackson Cross's office at Autotech. He is threatened to stay out of their affairs, and is forced to hand over the box. Returning to his office, Tex is met by the woman who talked the police into letting him go. She reveals her name is Regan Madsen, she is Thomas Malloy's daughter and that Malloy sent out several boxes like the one Tex found. Tex goes to the Fuchsia Flamingo and finds out that Emily is Malloy's wife, hence her being sent a box. using the return address on the packaging, Tex is finally able to track down Malloy in a run down warehouse in the industrial district. After establishing that Tex is not with the NSA, he reveals that he used to work at Roswell, the military base where a spacecraft allegedly crashed in 1947. Malloy asserts that the crash was legitimate and that the government covered the story up. The military began investigating then wreckage to look for weapons, and in the 1980s Malloy came into the project to attempt to decipher the hieroglyphics on the craft. After World War 3, Malloy left the project but was able to continue his research in secret. Before Malloy can continue his story, two NSA agents arrive and kill him. Tex is able to escape by blowing the building up. Tex fills a disheartened Fitzpatrick in on the events, but insists on following up on the details he has uncovered. Fitzpatrick tells him that he worked with Malloy in Roswell, and that after becoming close friends, Malloy confided in him that he had been deciphering the alien hieroglyphics and had discovered that a second spacecraft had crashed somewhere on Earth. He then reveals that he received one of Malloy's boxes and there are probably about 6 in circulation. Tex meets with Regan to tell her about her father, and she agrees to give him her box despite reservations that Tex will open it and sell off the information for himself. After stealing Horton's personal effects from the morgue where his body is being held, Tex is able to get into Autotech's evidence room to recover Emily's box. Tex travels to the Cosmic Connection shop and speaks to Archie Ellis, an eccentric comic book nerd and ufologist who recently interviewed Malloy. Archie tells him that the famous author Elijah Witt set up the interview between them, during which Malloy made several cryptic references to something called 'The Pandora Device'. He also reveals that during their research into the alien crafts at Roswell, the scientists accidentally released something into the facility that proceeded to kill off practically everyone in the complex before the military moved in and quarantined the entire base. Archie tells Tex that Malloy sent him one of the boxes but it was stolen, and that the alien power cell in a picture from one of the other boxes is still stored in the Roswell complex. Tex travels to Roswell and enters the deserted site, but whilst moving around the facility becomes increasingly aware that he is being stalked. It is revealed that the alien entity released by the researchers many years before is still lurking in the complex, but Tex is able to seal it off in a containment pod before he suffers that same fate and is then able to secure the power cell from the security room. Tex is able to break the code on a disc Malloy sent to Elijah Witt on which Malloy reveals that each of the boxes sent out contains a piece of the Pandora Device and that assembling the parts will reveal the information Malloy had discovered. After obtaining all the relevant pieces, Tex summons Fitzpatrick, Regan and Witt to his office where he assembles the Pandora Device. A hologram of Malloy appears and tells the group that there was indeed another spacecraft that landed on Earth and that Malloy discovered its location. He hypothesises that the ship contains large amounts of anti-hydrogen on board, and that if this gets into the wrong hands it could result in the destruction of life on Earth. Witt immediately decides that the ship must be destroyed, but Regan is adamant that they could sell the technology off for big money. Regardless, the four decide that they must find the craft so they each take a separate route to the location Malloy specified. Tex arrives and manages to navigate his way through a dense jungle and an ancient Mayan labyrinth in which he comes across Regan who set off earlier in hope she might get there first. Tex and Regan find the ship, but Jackson Cross arrives and it revealed that Regan and Cross had been working together all along. Before Cross is able to kill Tex, Fitzpatrick emerges from the ship and invites the three on board. Fitzpatrick shows them around and offers to show them the central power core before locking Regan and Cross inside, but not before Cross fires his gun and hits Fitzpatrick. As he is dying, Fitzpatrick reveals that he knows how to work the controls of the ship as his father was one of the aliens from the ship; his mother was a human woman from Nebraska, hence Fitzpatrick's human appearance. After urging Tex to type in the correct controls, he dies from his wound and Tex quickly exits the ship just in time for it to ascend into space and self-destruct. Tex is picked up by a late arriving Elijah Witt and taken home. =Endings= From this point several endings are possible depending on how you choose to make Tex behave throughout the game: Mission Street: 1\\\\. Chelsee returns from Phoenix and invites Tex round for dinner, during which he recounts his tale though she remains skeptical. Afterwards she reveals she is dressed in a square dance outfit and rewards Tex with a striptease. 2\\\\. Chelsee and Tex go for a drink at the Brew 'n' Stew. Chelsee reveals that she feels she isn't ready to commit to a relationship so and Tex should just remain good friends. Having signed up to the new 'holodate' service, a hologram of Clark Gable arrives to take Chelsee on a date. A deflated Tex returns to his office and calls the holodate service himself. He speaks to the manager (a hologram of Humphrey Bogart) and requests a two for one special date with Jayne Mansfield and Anna Nicole Smith. Lombard Street: 1\\\\. Same as Mission Street Ending 2. 2\\\\. On the space craft when Cross shoots he hits Tex instead of Fitzpatrick. He is able to limp off the ship and sees it explode. Having ruined his chances with Chelsee he decides to give up his career as a P.I. and join the circus as a clown. We see him backstage putting on his makeup before going on, glancing briefly at photograph of Chelsee before sadly leaving the room to perform. Boulevard of Broken Dreams: 1\\\\. Same as Lombard Street Ending 2 2\\\\. On the space craft Tex is shot in the leg, but is unable to get off before itself destructs and dies. 3\\\\. Before boarding the ship, Cross will give his gun to Tex and ask him to shoot Fitzpatrick. If the player opts to shoot Cross instead, the gun will be empty and Cross will pull out a loaded gun and shoot Tex dead. 4\\\\. If the player chooses to shoot Fitzpatrick, the gun will be empty. Before Cross can shoot Fitzpatrick himself, Tex suggests they go to look on the ship. Fitzpatrick will lock all three of them in the ship's core. Tex is able to unlock the door, but Fitzpatrick will have already begun flying the ship into space. The ship self-destructs and all four characters die. Gameplay The Pandora Directive was the second game in the series to make use of Under a Killing Moon's engine and feature real-time 3D graphics. Players explore environments from a first-person perspective and can click to examine objects or interact using a variety of verbs. In addition to verb interaction, players can gather, use, and combine items to solve a variety of puzzles, and must also solve self-contained logic puzzles. Character interaction consists of two primary modes: asking characters about a universal list of topics available to the player, and branching dialog trees. These dialog trees were unusual at the time in that they did not display Tex's full response, but rather a short and sometimes humorous description, a convention later popularized by BioWare. The Pandora Directive was one of the first adventure games to feature branching narratives and multiple endings. The player could take Tex down \\"Mission Street\\", where he takes the high road and wins the love of his longtime crush, Chelsee Bando. Mission Street has three possible endings. Down \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", Tex is a selfish and cynical jerk worrying only about the big payoff. Boulevard of Broken Dreams leads to four possible endings. If the player chooses neither path, Tex will go down \\"Lombard Street\\". On this path, he's not really a nice guy, but he's not mean either. Lombard Street leads to two possible endings, both of which are common to Mission Street. The \\"best\\" Mission Street ending is achieved when the player has taken the high road every time he was given the choice, and by exactly following two conversation paths earlier in the game. The Pandora Directive provided two difficulty settings, Entertainment and Game Players mode. On Entertainment, hints were available and the player could bypass certain puzzles if the player so chose. Some minor objects and video scenes were available on this setting that were not available on Game Players mode. A total of 1500 points were available on Entertainment mode. On Game Players mode, no hints were available and puzzles could not be bypassed. Bonus points were available to those who solved certain puzzles in an allotted time or within a certain number of moves. In addition to this, extra in game locations and puzzles were available on Game Players mode that weren't available on Entertainment mode, making for a more challenging game playing experience. A total of 4000 points were available on Game Players mode. The game has a large cast of characters ranging from the deranged to deadly. Several well-known actors starred, including Barry Corbin and Tanya Roberts. Reception According to Aaron Conners of Access Software, The Pandora Directives sales totaled \\"about 120,000 world-wide\\". A reviewer for Next Generation praised The Pandora Directives all-star cast, three-dimensional interface, storyline, and use of both sight gags and more subtle humor. He criticized that some of the puzzles \\"are just too difficult, requiring unbelievable stretches of imagination and leaps in logic\\", but concluded the game overall to be as good as fans of adventure games could hope for. He scored it four out of five stars. In PC Zone, Chris Anderson called The Pandora Directive \\"without question the best adventure game of its type\\". Scorpia of Computer Gaming World likewise praised it as a \\"superior entry in the adventure field.\\" She concluded: The Pandora Directive was named the best adventure game of 1996 by Computer Gaming World and Computer Game Entertainment, and a runner-up for PC Gamer USs and CNET Gamecenter's 1996 \\"Best Adventure Game\\" awards, which went respectively to The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery and The Neverhood. The editors of Computer Gaming World remarked, \\"Because your choices really affect how the game proceeds, this is, for once, an interactive movie that truly is interactive.\\" Those of PC Gamer US wrote that The Pandora Directive \\"may have the best cast ever featured in a PC Game\\", and that it \\"tops its predecessor in every way\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the game a B+ and wrote that \\"Because you never know exactly what Murphy is about to say, the game's entertainment value, at least the first time around, is exceptionally high.https://ew.com/article/1996/08/16/new-cd- roms-require-detective-work/ In 2011, Adventure Gamers placed it 9th on their list of all-time best adventure games. Novelization A novelization of the game was written by Aaron Conners in 1995. It differs slightly in details from the game, but the overall story is the same.

Russell Professor of American History at the University of Georgia. He continues to serve as a senior fellow of the University of Georgia's Institute of Higher Education, and is currently a professor at Pepperdine School of Law, where he teaches several classes including Property for the 1Ls. Background and education Larson was born in Mansfield, Ohio, and attended Mansfield public schools. He graduated from Williams College and received his J.D. from Harvard University and his Ph.D. in the history of science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. As a child, Larson hosted Martin Luther King Jr. in his home. During batting practice before the game where Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's home run record, Larson caught a ball hit by Hank Aaron. The ball was later signed by Hank Aaron and kept by Larson. Larson also has met and had lunch with the famous Michelle Triola. Triola was involved in a popular case regarding property between unmarried partners (her and Lee Martin), which can be found in Larson's textbook. Larson is married and has two children, Sarah and Luke. Career Larson has lectured on topics in the history of science, religion, and law at universities across the United States and in Canada, China, Britain, Australia, and South America. The author of books and articles dealing with voyages of scientific exploration, he has also given lectures at natural history museums and on cruise boats. His articles have appeared in Nature, Scientific American, The Nation, American History, Time, and various academic history and law journals. Larson received the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for History for his book Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion. The book argues that Inherit the Wind (both the play and the movie) misrepresented the actual Scopes Trial. Unlike in that play and movie, in which reason and tolerance triumph over religiously motivated, unsophisticated anti- evolutionists, Larson's book portrays the trial as an opening salvo in an enduring twentieth-century cultural war involving powerful national forces in science, religion, law and politics. \\"Indeed,\\" he concludes in the book, \\"the issues raised by the Scopes trial and legend endure precisely because they embody the characteristically American struggle between individual liberty and majoritarian democracy, and cast it in the timeless debate over science and religion.\\"Larson, Edward, Summer for the Gods, Basic Books, 1997, p. 265, . In 2004 Larson received an honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from The Ohio State University. He held the Fulbright Program's John Adams Chair in American Studies in 2000-01 and participated in the National Science Foundation's 2003 Antarctic Artists and Writers Program. He was a founding fellow of the International Society for Science and Religion. In 2005 Larson was interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show on evolution alongside William Dembski and Ellie Crystal.

Araria town is the administrative headquarters of this district. History Araria district, which was previously part of Purnia district, is part of the Mithila region. Mithila first gained prominence after being settled by Indo-Aryan peoples who established the Mithila Kingdom (also called Kingdom of the Videhas).Michael Witzel (1989), Tracing the Vedic dialects in Dialectes dans les litteratures Indo-Aryennes ed. Caillat, Paris, pages 13, 17 116–124, 141–143 During the late Vedic period (c. 1100–500 BCE), Kingdom of the Videhas became one of the major political and cultural centers of South Asia, along with Kuru and Pañcāla. The kings of the Kingdom of the Videhas were called Janakas. The Mithila Kingdom was later incorporated into the Vajji confederacy, which had its capital in the city of Vaishali, which is also in Mithila. The territory of the present-day district became Araria sub-division of the erstwhile Purnia district in 1964. Araria district was formed in January 1990 as one of the administrative districts of under Purnia Division.

It is one of the 36 districts in Bihar currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF). Demographics According to the 2011 census Araria district has a population of 2,811,569, roughly equal to the nation of Jamaica or the US state of Utah.

Air Chief Marshal Dawee was widely considered a pillar of Thailand's sporting world. After a successful career in the military which saw him rise to Supreme Command chief of staff in 1961, he turned to politics and was appointed deputy defense minister in 1963. He later served as minister of transport and communications and of agriculture. Head of Thailand's National Olympic Committee for 22 years until his death, he was a member of the International Olympic Committee and a force behind the Southeast Asian Games. Dawee himself won a silver medal in sailing at the 1970 Asian Games. After the October 1973 Thai popular uprising he served as minister of defense and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces Headquarters until 1974. In 1976 and 1979/80 he was again deputy prime minister of Thailand. Education He became a cadet at the Army Academy upon finishing secondary school, and graduated with the rank of 2nd Lieutenant in 1935. Early career Pilot Dawee during World War II Dawee soon joined the Air Force, and by 1938 had been promoted to flying officer. The young officer was soon enrolled in bombing and training courses with the RAF and USAAF, and returned two years later to become commanding officer of the 3rd Fighter Squadron, whose base was at Don Mueang. The conflict with French Indochina saw Dawee leading the 60th Fighter Squadron, which was composed of nine Hawk 75Ns. On 24 January 1941, it was Dawee's fighters that escorted the Ki-30 Nagoyas on the raid on the French airfield at Angkor Wat. Flight Lieutenant Dawee was a member of the last Thai military mission to Malaya in October 1941, and returned just days before the commencement of the Pacific War. World War IIEarly days= At 08:00 on 8 December 1941, Flight Lieutenant Dawee Chullasapya and Pilot Officer Sangwaan Worasap rushed off in their Hawk 75Ns to pursue a lone Japanese reconnaissance plane cruising in the skies above Don Mueang. The chase was frantic, but ultimately the Japanese pilot was saved from being shot down when the two Thai pilots were ordered to stand down and return to base. Dawee was sent later to serve as an attaché to General Yamashita's headquarters at Alor Star. He accompanied the Japanese 25th Army to as far as Johore before being forced to return to Bangkok as a result of malarial infections. =Working with Allies= In March 1945, Wing Commander Dawee was ordered to report to the Army Deputy Commander-in-Chief, who quickly presented the Wing Commander to the Regent at his riverside residence. The regent proceeded to explain that Dawee had been chosen to carry out liaison duties with the Allies in India on behalf of the Seri Thai. He was to leave on the night of 21 April by seaplane. Dawee was to make the journey with three Americans: two OSS officers, Majors John Wester and Howard Palmer; and the Flying Tigers' \\"Black Mac\\" McGarry, who since being shot down in the Chiang Mai area in January 1942 had been in a POW camp. Also in tow were 2nd Lieutenant Wimon Wiriyawit, a Seri Thai officer, and Fon Saengsinkaew. The party arrived in Madras some hours later, and Dawee continued on to Colombo, where he met Sanguan Tularak, a fellow Seri Thai agent. The sojourn in Ceylonese capital did not last long, however, as the Wing Commander was taken by Colonel John Coughlin of the OSS to meet Lord Mountbatten at Kandy. There Dawee received his OSS codename, \\"Dicky Stone\\". Wing Commander Dawee spent his time at Kandy studying aerial photographs of Thailand and assisting the bombing planners at South East Asia Command in selecting accurate Japanese military targets as opposed to Thai civilian ones. Dawee also received lessons in espionage and sabotage, and was forced to attend an intensive week-long OSS training course in Maryland. A posting to Calcutta saw Dawee acting as a liaison officer at Mountbatten's American deputy, General Raymond B. Wheeler's headquarters. The Thai again acted as a consultant to various USAAF bombing- run plans. He returned to Thailand a while later via seaplane. Dawee was to collect intelligence regarding Japanese troop dispositions, and to aid in the establishment of secret airfields for which the Allies could fly in agents and supplies to reinforce the Seri Thai. The Wing Commander immediately reported back to Pridi's new residence at the Bang Pa-In Summer Palace, approximately 70 km north of Bangkok. The next week was spent surveying the Northeast for prospective airfield sites. The sites they chose was in Chaiyaphum Province and at Nonhan in Loei Province. The Royal Thai Air Force duly began construction, assisted in no little part by the Governor of Chaiyaphum, a man fully committed to the resistance, and by Khon Kaen's chief Seri Thai officers, Tiang Sirikhanth and Chamlong Daoruang. Dawee once more returned to Calcutta, and from there on he oversaw equipment drops by B-24s on Sakhon Nakhorn, and accompanied a C-46 to Kunming and Chungking. =Return to Thailand= The airfields were ready by June, and Dawee was tasked to return to Thailand on board the first RAF C-47 to fly into the country. Prince Yuthisathien Sawasdiwat, a Seri Thai officer who had been parachuted in to evaluate the airfields, were waiting for him. On 14 June the plane landed, but the wheels sank into the ground. Once the supplies were unloaded, however, the airfield personnel were able to push the plane out of the mud and repair minor damage. Dawee returned to Calcutta to pick up OSS Major Nicol Smith and Lloyd George, a civilian reports officer, and to bring them to Bangkok for direct talks with Pridi. =End of war= Dawee supervised the creation of a massive arms cache in the many classrooms of Thammasat University, and returned to Calcutta on 10 August, where he celebrated the end of the war with the staff of SEAC. Postwar Dawee Chullasapya (center), meets with Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara at the Pentagon (1965) Dawee accompanied Seni Pramoj back to Bangkok on September 16, and returned permanently on December 5, 1945, escorting the young King Ananda Mahidol. Dawee was the head of the organising committees for the 1966 and 1970 Asian Games, both held in Bangkok. From 1973 to 1974, he was the Supreme Commander of the Royal Thai Armed Forces Headquarters. In 1974, he became the president of the National Olympic Committee of Thailand and member of the International Olympic Committee.  Political career  Dawee was vice minister of defence in Thanom Kittikachorn's government from 1963 to 1969. In January 1969, he ordered the napalm bombing of Hmong villages in Phitsanulok Province who were suspected of fighting for the communists. He stated: \\"They must be got rid of, once and for all.\\" After Thailand had received a new constitution in 1968, Dawee joined the United Thai People's Party, created by military leaders Thanom Kittikachorn and Praphas Charusathien in order to continue their rule under the guise of parliamentary system. Dawee became the secretary-general of that party. He then served as minister of communication and transport from 1969 to 1971. After Thanom and Praphat's self-coup in November 1971, that suspended the constitution, parliament and political parties again, Dawee served as minister of agriculture from 1972 to 1973. In December 1972, he led the negotiations with the Palestinian terrorist group Black September, who penetrated into the Israeli embassy in Bangkok and held several hostages. Dawee could achieve the release of all the hostages and a bloodless end of the crisis. Instead of the hostages, Dawee and Chatichai Choonhavan, then deputy foreign minister and future prime minister, accompanied the terrorists as surety on their freedom flight to Cairo.http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/911728/the-big- issue-the-terrorists-who-didn%E2%80%99t After the popular uprising of 1973, he was minister of defence under Prime Minister Sanya Dharmasakti and Supreme Commander of the Thai Armed Forces from 1973 to 1974. In December 1973, one and a half years before Thailand officially established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, Dawee and Chatichai who was foreign minister by that timewere the first Thai government officials to visit Beijing. There, they negotiated a contract for the supply of 50,000 tons of diesel oil at a \\"friendship price\\" and promised to remove trade barriers between the two nations. In 1974, Dawee co-founded the Social Justice Party, of which he became the chairman in 1976. He served as deputy prime minister and minister of public health under Seni Pramoj, until the day of the Thammasat University massacre, 6 October 1976. He was again deputy prime minister, this time under Kriangsak Chomanan, from 1979 to 1980.

They were a common weapon aboard ships and in land fortifications for several centuries but became obsolete after the invention of gun turrets.  History  By mounting a cannon on a pivot, a much wider arc of fire could be obtained than was possible with conventional carriage-mounted cannons. Unlike the latter, however, pivot guns were fixed in one place and could not easily be moved outside of their horizontal arc; they could thus only really be used in fixed positions such as in a fort or on a battleship. There was no standard size of pivot gun, though they tended to be fairly substantial weapons. Like other cannons, they were muzzleloaders and could fire either shells or grapeshot (or other types of shot). Their calibers ranged from a few inches to the giant 11-inch Dahlgren guns used by the United States Navy in the mid-19th century. Pivot guns had a major disadvantage in warfare: they were very difficult to protect in battle and were necessarily very exposed, as they lay close to the surface of a ship's deck and required an open field of view. In the late 19th century they were replaced by \\"disappearing guns\\" and ultimately by turrets, which enabled a broad arc of fire while providing the gunners with all-round protection from incoming fire. Pivot guns should not be confused with swivel guns, a much smaller type of ordnance.

The city of Purnia is the administrative headquarters of this district. The city of Purnia has continued its tradition of hoisting the national flag at 12:07 am on every Independence Day since 1947. Purnia district is a part of Purnia Division. The district extends northwards from the Ganges river. Purnia is the unofficial capital of Seemanchal due to its financial and educational importance. History Purnia is part of the Mithila region. Mithila first gained prominence after it was settled by Indo-Aryan peoples who established the Mithila Kingdom (also called Kingdom of the Videhas).Michael Witzel (1989), Tracing the Vedic dialects in Dialectes dans les litteratures Indo- Aryennes ed. Caillat, Paris, pages 13, 17 116–124, 141–143 During the late Vedic period (c. 1100–500 BCE), Videha became one of the major political and cultural centers of Ancient India, along with Kuru and Pañcāla. The kings of the Videha Kingdom were called Janakas. The Videha Kingdom was later incorporated into the Vajji confederacy, which had its capital in the city of Vaishali, which is also in Mithila. During the Mughal rule, Purnea was an outlying military province, and its revenue was mostly spent on protecting its borders against tribes from the north and east. After the capture of Calcutta in 1757, Purnia's local governor raised a rebellion against Siraj ud-Daulah. In 1765, the district became a British possession, along with the rest of Bengal. On February 14, 1770 the district of Purnia in modern history was formed by the East India Company. Purnia is known for its uniquely designed organization, Ramakrishna Mission, where the festival called Durga Puja is celebrated in October. Another attraction in the city of Purnia is the oldest temple of Mata Puran Devi which is 5 km away from the main city. It is theorized that Purnia received its name from this temple. Other theories also describe how Purnia received its name; which is, that in the past Purnia was named Purna- Aranya, which stands for \\"complete jungle.\\" The brief history is mentioned in The Bengal District gazetters - Purnea.

In the west, the soil is thickly covered with sand deposited by changes in the course of the Kosi. Among other rivers are the Mahananda and the Panar. Its major agricultural products are jute and banana.

Life and career Dyer was born in London on 4 May 1804. He was originally intended for a business career, and for some time acted as clerk in a West India house; but finding his services no longer required after the emancipation of the British West Indies, he decided to devote himself to literature. In 1850 Dyer published the Life of Calvin. According to the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica, it was \\" a conscientious and on the whole impartial work, though the character of Calvin is somewhat harshly drawn, and his influence in the religious world generally is insufficiently appreciated.\\" Dyer's first historical work was the History of Modern Europe (1861–1864; 3rd ed. revised and continued to the end of the 19th century, by A. Hassall, 1901), which was considered \\"a meritorious compilation and storehouse of facts, but not very readable\\" by Britannica. Dyer next published History of the City of Rome (1865) and History of the Kings of Rome (1868), which was considered a \\"conservative\\" and somewhat old-fashioned history by critics (such as J. R. Seeley and the Saturday Review) who felt Dyer uncritically trusted classical sources such as Livy, and did not take into account contemporary scholarship. Roma Regalis (1872) and A Plea for Livy (1873) were written in reply to his critics. Dyer frequently visited Greece and Italy, and wrote several \\"topographical\\" works which Britannica felt were his best.

Its length is and it is the third-longest river bridge in India.longest river bridge to be rebuilt business-standard.com It was inaugurated in May 1982 in a ceremony in Hajipur by the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi.  Planning and significance  Gandhi Setu Bridge in Patna, India The bridge was approved by the Central Government in 1969 and built by Gammon India Limited over a period of ten years, from 1972 to 1982. The total expenditure was crore (872.2 million rupees). It was built to connect North Bihar with the rest of Bihar through the state's capital at Patna, and as part of national highway 19 (NH19). Before this bridge was constructed, the only bridge crossing of the Ganges in Bihar was Rajendra Setu, approximately to the east, which had opened in 1959. Since then, the Vikramshila Setu has also been built across the Ganges. Two more rail-cum-road bridges are currently under construction, between Digha and Sonepur and at Munger.Ganga Rail-Road Bridge The Indian postal department issued a commemorative postage stamp, \\"Landmark Bridges Of India: Mahatma Gandhi Setu\\", on 17 August 2007.Welcome to the Indiapost Web Site  Engineering  The bridge consists of 45 intermediate spans of each and a span of at each end. The deck provides for a two-lane roadway for IRC class 70 R loading with footpaths on either side.Gammon India Ltd. - Builders to the nation The cantilever segmental construction method was adopted; each span has two cantilever beams on both sides which are free to move at the ends. It has two lanes, one upstream and the other downstream, each with a width of around . These lanes are free from each other with no connections. It was constructed using pre-cast parts, which were joined at both ends to complete the span. The spans are connected with a protrusion which is free to move longitudinally. Vertical movement allows for vibrations from vehicular movement to transfer smoothly between spans without much discreteness. Traffic congestion In recent decades, the bridge has experienced major traffic chaos due to the increasing number of vehicles crossing it, operating in excess of capacity and overloading the structure. The Bihar government has planned to build two pontoon bridges parallel to it, in order to relieve these problems. The bridge is crossed daily by over 85,000 vehicles and 12,000 pedestrians. On 21 September 2020 Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of another 4 lane road bridge measuring 14.5 km and will cost Rs. 2926.42 crores https://www.financialexpress.com/infrastructure/roadways/infra-boost-for- bihar-pm-modi-lays-foundation-stone-for-9-highway-projects-inaugurates- optical-fibre-services/2088198/ It will be on the west side of present bridge and in future, it will become 8 lane bridge including the present 4 lane bridge.  History  * Construction started: Year 1972 * Scheduled opening: June 1978. * Tender cost: Rs 23.50 crore * 1st Extension of Time (EOT): June 1980 * Allocated cost: Rs 46.67 crore * Reasons for cost increase: This extra cost is the outcome of an \\"in-built\\" cost escalation clause in the contract * Reasons for delay: Heavy storm in April 1979 destroyed two gantries and casting beds. Each gantry crane weighs 300 tonnes. Huge shortage of cement and building material and a workers' strike * Reports: Cement and other building materials stored for this project find their way into Nepal and parts of Bihar from the northern side of the bridge. * 2nd Extension of Time (EOT): December 1981 * Project progress: 80% ( physical ) up to September 1980 * Billed value: Rs 41 crore * Contractor’s extra claim : Rs 50 crore Litigation & arbitration: Disagreement between the contractors and the Government overpayments stalled construction activity. Claims and bills got referred to the Law Department. Final completion date: June 1982 ( Eastern carriageway ) Completion date: April 1987 ( Western carriageway ) Total cost: 87 crores Minister of State for Public Works: Raghunath Jha Chief Minister: Jagannath Mishra Structural integrity and failure The bridge has often been subjected to structural loads and moving loads exceeding its design. Major repairs were initiated on it within five years of its completion. Poor maintenance, coupled with wear and tear caused by the unprecedented surge in traffic, has made the structure vulnerable. Other bridges in India which were built with the same cantilever design have developed cracks. Investigations into the fissures developed in the bridge revealed the following defects: hammering at the hinges when vehicles plied; finger-type expansion joints in an advanced state of distress; wearing coat cracks; spilling of concrete at transverse joints; longitudinal cracks in precast segments; leakage of water inside the box girder from joints between segments and from holes provided for lifting the segments. Mahatma Gandhi Setu is now being revamped. It may have happened that due to such inferior quality of reinforcement coupled with inferior concrete have been causes for such catastrophic failure. Stressed cables are not grouted at all. They are acting like de-bonded tendons. There is minimal stress left. That is why external pre-stressing made later could not make up the stresses lost. Even cables do not conform to the as-built drawings submitted. All as-built drawings say how improper the design was. Providing central hinge bearing may not have given so much of adverse effect as the problems cited above. Now it is becoming clear that there were faults in all the departments, be it design or construction or supervision or material deficiency.

Haflinger horses are relatively small, are always chestnut with flaxen mane and tail, have distinctive gaits described as energetic but smooth, and are well-muscled yet elegant. The breed traces its ancestry to the Middle Ages; several theories for its origin exist. Haflingers, developed for use in mountainous terrain, are known for their hardiness. Their current conformation and appearance are the result of infusions of bloodlines from Arabian and various European breeds into the original native Tyrolean ponies. The foundation sire, 249 Folie, was born in 1874; by 1904, the first breeders' cooperative was formed. All Haflingers can trace their lineage back to Folie through one of seven bloodlines. World Wars I and II, as well as the Great Depression, had a detrimental effect on the breed, and lower-quality animals were used at times to save the breed from extinction. During World War II, breeders focused on horses that were shorter and more draft-like, favored by the military for use as packhorses. The emphasis after the war shifted toward animals of increased refinement and height. In the postwar era, the Haflinger was indiscriminately crossed with other breeds and some observers feared the breed was in renewed danger of extinction. However, starting in 1946, breeders focused on producing purebred Haflingers and a closed stud book was created. Interest in the breed increased in other countries, and between 1950 and 1974, the population grew, even while the overall European horse population decreased. Population numbers continued to increase steadily, and as of 2005, almost 250,000 Haflingers existed worldwide. Breeding farms are in several countries, although most of the breeding stock still comes from Austria. In 2003, a Haflinger became the first horse to be cloned, resulting in a filly named Prometea. Haflingers have many uses, including light draft, harness work, and various under-saddle disciplines such as endurance riding, dressage, equestrian vaulting, and therapeutic riding. They are also still used by the Austrian and German armies for work in rough terrain. The World Haflinger Federation, the international governing body that controls breed standards for the Haflinger, is made up of a confederation of 22 national registries, and helps set breeding objectives, guidelines, and rules for its member organizations. Breed characteristics The name \\"Haflinger\\" comes from the village of Hafling, which today is in northern Italy. The breed is also called the Avelignese, from the Italian name for Hafling, which is Avelengo or previously Aveligna. Haflingers are always chestnut in color and occur in shades ranging from a light gold to a rich golden chestnut or liver hue. The mane and tail are white or flaxen. The height of the breed has increased since the end of World War II, when it stood an average of . The desired height today is between . Breeders are discouraged from breeding horses under the minimum size, but taller individuals may pass inspection if they otherwise meet requirements of the breed registry. The breed has a refined head and light poll. The neck is of medium length, the withers are pronounced, the shoulders sloping, and the chest deep. The back is medium-long and muscular; the croup is long, slightly sloping, and well-muscled. The legs are clean, with broad, flat knees and powerful hocks showing clear definition of tendons and ligaments. The Haflinger has rhythmic, ground-covering gaits. The walk is relaxed but energetic. The trot and canter are elastic, energetic, and athletic with a natural tendency to be light on the forehand and balanced. Some knee action is seen, and the canter has a very distinct motion forwards and upwards. One important consideration in breeding during the second half of the 20th century was temperament. A requirement for a quiet, kind nature has become part of official breed standards and is checked during official inspections.Deverill, The Haflinger, pp. 25–27 Some sources recognize two types of Haflingers, a shorter, heavier type used for draft work, and a taller, lighter type used for pleasure riding, light driving, and under-saddle competition.Dutson, Storey's Illustrated Guide to 96 Horse Breeds of North America, p. 125Damerow and Rice, Draft Horses and Mules, p. 72 The Food and Agriculture Organization recognizes both an \\"Avelignese\\" and an \\"Avelignese Tradizionale\\" as existing in Italy, although, as of 2007, only 13 of the latter existed, including only one breeding stallion. However, all breed organizations recognize and register only one type. =Stallion lines= All Haflingers today trace their lineage through one of seven stallion lines to Folie, the foundation stallion of the breed. Usually, colts are given a name beginning with the letter or letters denoting their stallion line, and fillies are given a name beginning with the first letter of their dam's name. The exceptions are France, where foals are given a name beginning with a letter of the alphabet designated to be used for that year; and Italy, where colts' names must begin with the letter or letters designating the stallion line, while fillies' names begin with the letter designated for a given year. The seven stallion lines are:Deverill, The Haflinger, pp. 30–37 A Haflinger in South Tyrol * A-line. Founded by Anselmo, born 1926. One of the most prevalent lines today, descendants include the second-largest number of stallions at stud. Anselmo was brought back to stud at the age of 21, when a lack of stallions after World War II led to concerns that the line would not survive, and produced several stallions now represented in all Haflinger breeding populations worldwide. * B-line. Founded by Bolzano, born 1915. Bolzano's less common line, although strong in Austria, is not prevalent elsewhere. The line is spreading nevertheless; the U.S. and several European countries including Great Britain are establishing Bolzano lines. * M-line. Founded by Massimo, born 1927. An Italian stallion, Massimo founded a line that is prevalent in Austria and Italy. * N-line. Founded by Nibbio, born 1920. Early in its history, the Nibbio line split into two branches, one in Italy and one in Austria. The N-line is populous, with the greatest number of stallions at stud. It is one of two (the other being the A-line) with a presence in all Haflinger breeding countries. The line is most prolific in Austria and Italy. * S-line. Founded by Stelvio, born 1923. Stelvio is the least numerous of the lines, threatened with extinction after non-Haflinger blood was introduced in Germany. Currently most populous in Italy, Austrian authorities are working to re-establish it. * ST-line. Founded by Student, born 1927. Although the ST- line has a large number of stallions, its geographic spread is limited because of unselective breeding in some countries. Germany and the U.S. hold the most horses of this line outside Austria. * W-line. Founded by Willi, born 1921. The W-line, threatened by crossbreeding early in its history, maintains a strong presence in the Netherlands, Canada and the U.S., with a smaller population in Austria. Bolzano and Willi were great-great grandsons of Folie, while the rest were great-great-great grandsons. Especially in the early years of the breed's history, some inbreeding occurred, both by accident and design, which served to reinforce the breed's dominant characteristics. During the 1980s and 1990s, several studies were conducted to examine morphological differences among the breed lines. Significant differences were found in some characteristics, including height and proportions; these have been used to help achieve breeding objectives, especially in Italy during the 1990s. History Haflingers used as pack horses during a medieval re-enactment The history of the Haflinger horse traces to the Middle Ages. Origins of the breed are uncertain, but two main theories are given. The first is that Haflingers descend from horses abandoned in the Tyrolean valleys in central Europe by East Goths fleeing from Byzantine troops after the fall of Conza in 555 AD. These abandoned horses are believed to have been influenced by Oriental bloodlines and may help explain the Arabian physical characteristics seen in the Haflinger.Bongianni, Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses and Ponies, Entry 157 A type of light mountain pony was first recorded in the Etsch Valley in 1282, and was probably the ancestor of the modern Haflinger.Deverill, The Haflinger, p. 5 The second theory is that they descended from a stallion from the Kingdom of Burgundy sent to Margrave Louis of Brandenburg by his father, Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, when the Margrave married Princess Margarete Maultasch of the Tyrol in 1342. It has also been suggested that they descend from the prehistoric forest horse. Haflingers have close connections to the Noriker, a result of the overlapping geographic areas where the two breeds were developed.Edwards, The Encyclopedia of the Horse, p. 185 Whatever its origins, the breed developed in a mountainous climate and was well able to thrive in harsh conditions with minimal maintenance. The breed as it is known today was officially established in the village of Hafling in the Etschlander Mountains, then located in Austria-Hungary.Edwards, The Encyclopedia of the Horse, p. 52 The Arabian influence was strongly reinforced in the modern Haflinger by the introduction of the stallion El Bedavi, imported to Austria in the 19th century. El-Bedavi's half-Arabian great-grandson, El-Bedavi XXII, was bred at the Austro-Hungarian stud at Radautz and was sire of the breed's foundation stallion, 249 Folie, born in 1874 in the Vinschgau. Folie's dam was a native Tyrolean mare of refined type. All Haflingers today must trace their ancestry to Folie through one of seven stallion lines (A, B, M, N, S, ST, and W) to be considered purebred. The small original gene pool, and the mountain environment in which most original members of the breed were raised, has resulted in a very fixed physical type and appearance. In the early years of the breed's development Oriental stallions such as Dahoman, Tajar and Gidran were also used as studs, but foals of these stallions lacked many key Haflinger traits and breeding to these sires was discontinued.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, p. 12 After the birth of Folie in 1874, several Austrian noblemen became interested in the breed and petitioned the government for support and direction of organized breeding procedures. It was 1899 before the Austrian government responded, deciding to support breeding programs through establishment of subsidies; high-quality Haflinger fillies were among those chosen for the government-subsidized breeding program. Since then the best Haflinger fillies and colts have been chosen and selectively bred to maintain the breed's quality. Horses not considered to meet quality standards were used by the army as pack animals.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, pp. 13–16 By the end of the 19th century Haflingers were common in both South and North Tyrol, and stud farms had been established in Styria, Salzburg and Lower Austria.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, p. 19 In 1904, the Haflinger Breeders' Cooperative was founded in Mölten, in South Tyrol, with the aim of improving breeding procedures, encouraging pure-breeding and establishing a studbook and stallion registry.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, p. 16 =World Wars= World War I resulted in many Haflingers being taken into military service and the interruption of breeding programs. After the war, under the terms of the Treaty of Saint Germain, South Tyrol (including Hafling) was ceded to Italy, while North Tyrol remained in Austria. This split was extremely detrimental to the Haflinger breed, as most of the brood mares were in South Tyrol in what was now Italy, while the high-quality breeding stallions had been kept at studs in North Tyrol and so were still in Austria. Little effort at cooperation was made between breeders in North and South Tyrol, and in the 1920s a new Horse Breeders' Commission was established in Bolzano in Italy, which was given governmental authority to inspect state-owned breeding stallions, register privately owned stallions belonging to Commission members, and give prize money for horse show competition. The Commission governed the breeding of the Italian population of both the Haflinger and the Noriker horse. In 1921, because of the lack of breeding stallions in Italy, a crossbred Sardinian-Arabian stallion was used for the Haflinger breeding program, as well as many lower-quality purebred Haflingers.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, pp. 20–22 A combined driving event If not for the presence of Haflinger stallions at a stud farm in Stadl-Paura in Upper Austria after World War I, the Haflinger might well not exist in Austria today. Despite these stallions, the Haflinger breeding programs were not on solid footing in Austria, with governmental focus on other Austrian breeds and private breeding programs not large enough to influence national breeding practices.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, pp. 22–29 During this time, the breed was kept alive through crosses to the Hucul, Bosnian, Konik and Noriker breeds. In 1919 and 1920, the remaining stallions were assigned throughout Austria, many to areas that had hosted private breeding farms before the war. In 1921, the North Tyrolean Horse Breeders' Cooperative was formed in Zams, and in 1922, the first Haflinger Breeders' Show was held in the same location. Many extant Austrian Haflinger mares were considered to be of too low quality to be used as brood mares, and every effort was made to import higher-quality brood mares from the South Tyrol herds now in Italy. In 1926, the first studbook was established in North Tyrol. In the late 1920s, other cooperatives were established for Haflinger breeders in Weer and Wildschönau, and were able to gain government permission to purchase 100 Haflinger mares from South Tyrol and split them between North Tyrol, Upper Austria and Styria. This single transaction represented one third of all registered mares in South Tyrol, and many others were sold through private treaty, leaving the two regions comparable in terms of breeding-stock populations. In 1931, another breeders' cooperative was established in East Tyrol in Austria, and Haflinger breeding spread throughout the entire Tyrolean province.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, p. 30 The Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s dampened horse prices and had an unfavorable effect on Haflinger breeding, but from 1938 onwards markets improved as a result of the buildup for World War II. All crossbred horses and colts not of breeding quality could be sold to the army, and higher subsidies were given by the government to Haflinger breeders. However, the demands of the war also meant that many unregistered mares of Haflinger type were covered by registered stallions, and the resulting progeny were registered, resulting in a degradation of breeding stock.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, pp. 31–32 In 1935 and 1936, a breeding program was begun in Bavaria through the cooperation of the German agricultural authorities, military authorities and existing stud farms. The first government-run German Haflinger stud farm was established in Oberaudorf with brood mares from North and South Tyrol, and several private stud farms were established elsewhere in the country. The combination of a high demand for pack horses and variable amounts of breed knowledge of the purchasers led to the purchase of both high- and low-quality horses, which had mixed results on breed quality. Purchases by Bavarians also resulted in a further depletion of Austrian and Italian stock, already low from the population depletions of both world wars. However, the German Armed Forces were ready purchasers, and the purchasing and breeding continued. Despite some claims that only purebred horses were registered, many well-known Bavarian studs had crossbred maternal lines.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, pp. 32–34 During World War II, Haflingers were bred to produce horses that were shorter and more draft-like for use as packhorses by the military. After the war, breeding emphasis changed to promote refinement and height. =Postwar period= After World War II, Haflinger breeding programs almost collapsed as the military stopped buying horses and government-run breeding centers were closed. Breeders continued to emphasize those features necessary for pack horses (the largest use by the military), but neglected other key Haflinger characteristics. Haflinger breeding had to change to create a horse that better fit modern trends toward recreational use. Around this time, all small breed cooperatives were combined into the Haflinger Breeders' Association of Tyrol.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, pp. 35–36 Post-World War II Tyrol, including the breeding center at Zams, was under the control of American forces, who slaughtered many horses to provide meat for hospitals. However, the troops did allow the breeding director to choose 30 stallions to be kept for breeding purposes. Those horses were relocated to the French-occupied Kops Alm high pasture in Vorarlberg, but they were subsequently stolen and never seen again. In other areas of Tyrol, all one- to three-year-old colts had been requisitioned by military breeding centers, and therefore it was necessary to treat colts not even a year old as potential breeding stallions.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, p. 36 In the years after World War II, some observers feared that the breed was dying out because of indiscriminate crossing with other breeds.Hayes, Points of the Horse, p. 400 Haflinger mares in Germany in the mid-1980s At conferences in 1946 and 1947, the decision was made to breed Haflinger horses from pure bloodlines, creating a closed stud book with no new blood being introduced. The Tyrolean Haflinger Breeders' Association established its own stallion center and prohibited private breeders from keeping stallions, thus ensuring that the association maintained 100 percent control of breeding stallions. In Bavaria, several young stallions had been saved and breeders could privately own stallions. Bavarian and Tyrolean breeders maintained close ties and cooperated extensively. North Tyrolean breeders were also able to acquire several high-quality older stallions and lower-quality young stallions from South Tyrol. In 1947, the Federation of Austrian Haflinger Breeders was established as a governing organization for the provincial associations. At this time a large-scale breed show was held, attended by visitors from Switzerland, who soon after their return home sent a purchasing commission to Austria and were instrumental in founding the Haflinger population in Switzerland. Southern Tyrol had no difficulty in selling its horses, as all of Italy was in the market to purchase horses, and breeding populations spread as far south as Sicily.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, pp. 38–39 Between 1950 and 1974, even as the overall European equine population was dropping due to increased mechanization, the Haflinger population was increasing. In that time period, the population of registered Haflinger brood mares rose from 1,562 to 2,043. This was mainly a result of the increased marketing of the breed, and happened even as Norwegian Fjord horses were exported to Germany, reducing the resources available for Haflinger breeding programs. Through well-planned marketing campaigns, the Haflinger became the dominant small-horse breed in the region.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, pp. 40–41 In 1954, Yugoslavia and Italy purchased breeding stock from North Tyrol to establish their own Haflinger programs and in 1956 the German Democratic Republic followed suit.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, p. 45 The first Haflingers were exported to the United States from Austria in 1958 by Tempel Smith of Tempel Farms in Illinois and into Czechoslovakia in 1959. Tyrolean Haflingers were purchased by the Netherlands and Turkey in 1961. In Turkey they were both bred pure and crossed with the Karacabey breed. In 1963, the first Haflinger was exported to Great Britain,Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, pp. 46–49 in 1969 two Haflinger mares were presented to Queen Elizabeth II upon her official visit to Austria,Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, pp. 50–52 and in 1970, the Haflinger Society of Great Britain was established. The first Haflinger was exported to France in 1964, and they continued to be transferred to that country until 1975, when the breeding population became stable. Between 1980 and 2000, the population of Haflingers in France tripled. In 1965, the first international Haflinger show was held at Innsbruck, with horses from East and West Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland and Austria participating. Haflingers were first exported to Belgium in 1966, to Bhutan in 1968, and to Poland, Hungary and Albania in subsequent years. The importations to Bhutan encouraged interest in the breed in other parts of Asia.Deverill, The Haflinger, p. 22 In 1974, the first Haflinger was imported to Australia. The first Canadian Haflinger was registered with the United States breed association in 1977, and a Canadian registry was formed in 1980. Between 1970 and 1975, Haflingers were also imported into Luxemburg, Denmark, Thailand, Columbia, Brazil, southwest Africa, Sweden and Ireland. They have also been imported into Japan. Haflingers maintained a population on every populated continent by the end of the 1970s. Worldwide breeding continued through the 1980s and 1990s, and population numbers increased steadily.Deverill, The Haflinger, p. 24 =21st century= Although the Haflinger is now found all over the world, the majority of breeding stock still comes from Austria, where state studs own the stallions and carefully maintain the quality of the breed. However, breeding farms are located in the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and England. As of 2007, Italian Haflingers had the largest population of any breed in that country. Due to selective breeding during the 1990s aiming to increase height, some breed lines became favored over others in Italy. A 2007 study found little inbreeding within the Italian Haflinger population as a whole, although certain less popular lines had a higher incidence due to the existence of fewer breeding stallions. Haflingers are bred throughout France, especially in the provinces of Brittany, Burgundy, and Picardy, with between 350 and 400 foals born each year. Slovenia also has a small Haflinger population, with around 307 breeding mares and 30 breeding stallions as of 2008. A 2009 study found that although a very small amount of inbreeding occurred in the population, it was increasing slightly over the years. As of 2005, almost 250,000 Haflingers remained in the world. On May 28, 2003, a Haflinger filly named Prometea became the first horse clone born. Bred by Italian scientists, she was cloned from a mare skin cell, and was a healthy foal. In 2008, Prometea herself gave birth to the first offspring of an equine clone, a colt named Pegaso sired by a Haflinger stallion through artificial insemination. The American Haflinger Registry does not allow horses born as a result of cloning to be registered, although as of 2010 other nations' registries have not yet entered a decision on the topic. In January 2012, Breyer Horses created a model horse of the Haflinger. Uses Haflingers pulling a carriage in northern Austria Haflingers were bred to be versatile enough for many under-saddle disciplines, but still solid enough for draft and driving work. The Haflinger was originally developed to work in the mountainous regions of its native land, where it was used as a packhorse and for forestry and agricultural work. In the late 20th century Haflingers were used by the Indian Army in an attempt to breed pack animals for mountainous terrain, but the program was unsuccessful because of the Haflinger's inability to withstand the desert heat.Edwards, The Encyclopedia of the Horse, p. 53 The Austrian Army still uses Haflingers as packhorses in rough terrain. They are used most often in high Alpine terrain, with slopes up to 40% and steps of up to . Around 70 horses are in use, held by the 6th Infantry Brigade and based in Hochfilzen. The Haflinger is also used by the German army for rough terrain work and demonstration purposes. Today, the breed is used in many activities that include draft and pack work, light harness and combined driving, and many under-saddle events, including western-style horse-show classes, trail and endurance riding, dressage, show jumping, vaulting, and therapeutic riding programs. They are used extensively as dressage horses for children, but are tall and sturdy enough to be suitable riding horses for adults. In the 1970s, British Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh competed with a driving team of four Haflingers.Deverill, The Haflinger, p. 60 Several national shows for Haflingers are held, including those in Germany, Great Britain, and the United States. Despite the Austrian prohibitions against crossbreeding, other countries have practiced this to some extent. Good-quality animals have been produced out of crosses between Haflingers and both Arabians and Andalusians. British enthusiasts maintain a partbred registry for Haflinger crosses.Deverill, The Haflinger, p. 95 In Germany, horses that are 75 percent Haflinger and 25 percent Arabian are popular and are called Arabo- Haflingers.Hendricks, International Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds, p. 212 In Italy, where horse meat consumption is at the highest among all European Community members, Haflingers provide a large percentage of national production. Most are either bred specifically for meat production and slaughtered between the ages of 10 and 18 months, or as a result of health problems, or age. The Haflinger also produces the majority of the horse milk consumed in Germany. Registration Breed organizations exist in many countries to provide accurate documentation of Haflinger pedigrees and ownership, and to promote the Haflinger breed. Most are linked to each other through membership in the World Haflinger Federation (WHF), established in 1976.Schweisgut, Haflinger Horses, p. 56 The WHF establishes international breeding guidelines, objectives and rules for studbook selection, and performance tests. They also authorize European and world shows and compile an annual list of Haflinger experts, or adjudicators. The WHF is the international umbrella organization, with 21 member organizations in 22 countries. Membership organizations include the Haflinger Horse Society of Australia, the Australian Haflinger Horse Breeders Association, the Canadian Haflinger Association, the Haflinger Pferdezuchtverband Tirol (Tyrolean Haflinger Breeding Association), the Italian Associazione Nazionale Allevatori Cavalli di Razza Haflinger Italia and the American Haflinger Registry, as well as a division for breeders in countries that are not already members. National organizations are allowed to become members of the WHF through agreeing to promote pure breeding and maintain the hereditary characteristics of the Haflinger breed. Member organizations must maintain both a purebred studbook and a separate part-bred studbook for animals with Arabian or other bloodlines. A group of Haflinger horses: Note the similarities in color and profile. A strict system of inspection, started in Austria, has evolved to ensure that only good-quality stock meeting high standards are used for breeding. This is coupled with close maintenance of the studbook to maintain inspection validity. Mares must be inspected and registered with the stud book before they can be covered, and multiple forms are needed to prove covering and birth of a purebred Haflinger foal. Within six months of birth, foals are inspected, and those considered to have potential as breeding stock are given certificates of pedigree and branded. Horses are reinspected at three years old, checked against written association standards, and if they pass, are then entered into the studbook. After their final inspection, Haflingers from Austria and Italy are branded with a firebrand in the shape of an edelweiss. Horses from Austria and from South Tyrol have the letter \\"H\\" in the center of the brand, while horses from all other parts of Italy have the letters \\"HI\\". Horses are graded based on conformation, action, bone, height, temperament and color. Mares must have a fully registered purebred pedigree extending six generations back to be considered for stud-book acceptance. Stallions are registered separately. Colts must have a dam with a fully purebred pedigree, and are inspected based on hereditary reliability and likely breeding strength, as well as the other qualifications. Each stallion's registration certification must show a fully purebred pedigree extending back four generations, and records of mares covered, percentages of pregnancies aborted, still-born and live-born, and numbers and genders of foals born. This information is used to match stallions and mares for breeding. Tyrolean colts undergo an initial assessment, and those not chosen must be either gelded or sold out of the Tyrolean breeding area. The chosen colts are reassessed every six months until a final inspection at the age of three, when the best stallions are chosen for Tyrolean breeding, after which they are purchased by the Austrian Ministry of Agriculture and made available for breeding throughout the region. The others are either gelded or sold out of the region. Other countries base their registration and selection practices on Tyrolean ones, as is required by the WHF.Deverill, The Haflinger, pp. 28–29, 72 ReferencesFurther reading   * * External links * Federation of South Tyrol Haflinger Horse Breeders * Tyrolean Haflinger Breeding Association * American Haflinger Registry * Haflinger Society of Great Britain * Canadian Haflinger Association * Australian Haflinger Horse Breeders Association * Haflinger Horse Association New Zealand * Collaboration of Haflinger Breeders and Holders of Germany (AGH) Category:Horse breeds Category:Horse breeds originating in Austria Category:Horse breeds originating in Italy ","title":"Haflinger"},{"id":"2466967","text":"The Machbet (Hebrew: מחבט, meaning \\"racquet\\") is an Israeli upgrade of the M163 Hovet self-propelled automatic anti-aircraft gun, based in turn on the M113 armored personnel carrier.

The IAF was planning to convert all its Hovets to the newer Machbet configuration. Most of the Hovets have already been converted over to the Machbet. The Machbet upgrade adds an enhanced suite of TV and FLIR target auto-tracking capability to the Hovet. A unit-level fire coordination and management capability is provided, as well as an interface to a sectorial air surveillance radar for the air targets picture. These all enable it to acquire approaching targets quicker, making the Machbet more effective than its predecessor.

The district headquarters are located at Khagaria. Earlier it was a part of Munger District as a sub-division that was created in 1943-44. It was upgraded to the status of a district on 10 May 1981. Khagaria district is a part of Munger Division. The present collector and District Magistrate of Khagaria is Shri Alok Ranjan Ghosh and the current S.P of khagaria is Amitesh Kumar, IPS 2016 batch. History Also known as Farakiya in local region. There is an interesting story behind it. Five centuries ago Akbar, then the king of Mughal empire directed his revenue minister Todar Mal to map his entire empire. But he could not map this region now known as Khagaria due to difficult terrain, rivers and dense forests. So, he named it Farakiya (Farak in Urdu means separate, different). Now there is even a weekly newspaper- 'Farkiyanchal Times' (albeit published arbitrarily) and Farakiya times (weekly news paper). Geography Khagaria district occupies an area of , comparatively equivalent to Greenland's Nares Land. The district is surrounded by seven rivers namely Ganges, Kamla Balan, Koshi, Budhi Gandak, Kareh, Kali Koshi and Bagmati. These rivers cause floods every year which causes great loss of life and property including livestock. River Ganga forms the southern boundary of the district. Khagaria experiences an extreme climate with very hot summers and extremely cold winters. Rainy season continues up to October with heavy rainfall causing the rivers to overflow and causing floods in most regions. Khagaria has rich alluvial soil which is very good for cultivation which is a major occupation of most of the rural population. The dictrict does not have any mineral resources. Wheat is a prominent rabi crop in the district while Maize is abundantly grown in almost throughout the district. Banana cultivation as a cash crop has grown into prominence in last two decades. Banana cultivation is done mostly in Choutham, Gogari and Parvatta blocks. Apart from these mango and litchi orchards are abundant in this district and are found almost throughout the entire area. The study of old gazetteers shows that these orchards have been in existence for a long time.

On November 29, 2005, the opposition to the government tabled a non-confidence motion which passed, dissolving Parliament and effectively killing the bill. The subsequent government tabled a similar bill called C-61. Bill C-60 primarily implemented amendments to meet compliance obligations of two World Intellectual Property Organization treaties Canada is seeking to ratify, the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. In particular Technology Protection Measures (TPMs) and Rights Management Information (RMI), components of Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems were addressed. It also included updates addressing short-term copyright reform issues dealing with the \\"challenges and opportunities presented by the Internet and digital technology in general\\". These focused on subjects such as network service provider liability, remote technology-based learning, and digital inter-library loans. Photography issues were given attention but Internet radio and Crown copyright were not. Seen as the Canadian equivalent to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the United States, Bill C-60 met with public opposition before its first reading, with approximately 1800 Canadians signing the Petition for Users' Rights. Those opposed to the bill saw Bill C-60 as a move towards strengthening rights for copyright holders, while conceding the rights of users. They appealed to the government to \\"protect [Canadians'] creative, cultural and communications rights.\\" ContentTPM protection= Technology Protection Measures (TPMs) refer to any technology-based solution that controls access to works, use of works, or both, ranging from simple passwords to complex cryptographic measures. They are often used to control copy protection of material and are often combined with other technologies as part of DRM systems. Instead of explicitly prohibiting circumvention of TPMs, Bill C-60 provided remedies to copyright holders in the even of a TPM being compromised. These powers applied in three cases: (a) compromising a TPM for the purpose of infringing copyrights; (b) aiding in compromising a TPM; or (c) being aware that material in one's possession contains a compromised TPM. These provisions effectively sought to remove the right of people to make private copies of sound recordings. For example, when Bill C-60 was introduced, most songs on iTunes were sold with TPMs. The previously available right to make a private copy would have required compromising this TPM. =RMI protection= Rights Management Information (RMI) refers to information that is attached to a material form of a work that permits identification of the work or its author or describes terms or conditions of its use. RMIs are commonly part of DRM systems. Similarly to TPMs, Bill C-60 did not imply that removing or altering an RMI constitutes copyright infringement, however, it provided copyright holders with remedies for alterations that facilitated or concealed the owner's copyright. These powers applied for material: (a) sold or rented; (b) distributed in a way damaging to the copyright owner; (c) as a result of trade, distributed or exposed to sale, rental, or public exhibit; (d) imported material into Canada; or (e) telecommunicated to the public. =Internet related protections=Network service providers Bill C-60 prescribed that network service providers are only required to remove content pursuant to a court order. However, it required network service providers to operate by a notice-and-notice system: allegations of copyright infringement needed to be forwarded to the subscriber. While failure to forward the notice came with a maximum damage award of $5,000, there was no penalty for filing a wrongful notice. The bill required the network service provider retain subscriber identity records for six months upon receipt of an infringement notice and for one year in the event of legal proceedings. Failure to do so came with statutory damages of up to $10,000 for the network service provider. Search engines Referred to in Bill C-60 as \\"information location tool providers\\", search engines were required to abide by a similar notice-and- notice system as that of network service providers. Provisions were made for one exception: copyright infringement through the caching mechanism of the search engine. While not liable for infringements made in this manner, Bill C-60 stated that search engines can be ordered to remove the infringing material from the cache or be requested to stop caching infringing content. In this case, a notice-and-takedown system is established. Peer-to-peer While Bill C-60 did not alter the right to make private copies of copyrighted material, it introduced limitations on the use of these private copies. In particular, the bill sought to make selling, renting, trading, distributing, and communicating legally-made private copies of a copyrighted work an infringement of copyrights. This implied that if downloads via peer-to-peer were \\"for personal use, and not redistributed, there will be no infringement.\\" =Photography protections= Under Bill C-60, photographers commissioned to take photographs were to retain ownership of the copyright of these photographs. This change came as an attempt to generalize the treatment of authors under the act; in the existing act, photographers were treated differently. This made sense for corporate commissioning, giving the photographer substantial bargaining power. However, for the average consumer, the provisions removed rights, and control over the use, duplication, distribution, display, and derivations of such commissioned works were greatly compromised. Differences from DMCA Bill C-60 targeted only the act of circumventing copy-protections for the explicit purpose of infringing copyright, while the DMCA targets the makers and distributors of devices using circumvention techniques and bans all forms of circumvention without regard to intention. The latter is seen to be more stifling for technological innovation. Secondly, in the area of the Internet, Bill C-60 sought to impose a system of notice-and-notice for network service providers. In contrast, the DMCA prescribes a system of notice-and-takedown in order for network service providers to be exempt from infringement liability.

Early life and education  Peter Elmsley was the younger son of Alexander Elmsley of St Clement Danes, Westminster, who had Scottish ancestry. He was educated at Westminster School, London (from 5 June 1788) and Christ Church College, Oxford, where he graduated with a BA in 1794, later gaining an MA in 1797, a BD on 30 October 1823, and a DD on 7 November 1823. He inherited a fortune in 1802 from his uncle, also named Peter Elmsley, a well-known bookseller in The Strand, Central London, and devoted himself to the study of classical authors and manuscripts.  Professional work  Elmsley was ordained a deacon of the Church of England on 31 December 1797 and a priest on 29 April 1798; on the same date in April 1798 he was appointed perpetual curate to the chapelry of Little Horkesley in Essex, which he held until his death. In around 1802 he lived in Edinburgh, and contributed articles to the Edinburgh Review on Heyne's Iliad, Schweighäuser's Athenæus, Blomfield's Prometheus, and Porson's Hecuba. He also contributed to the Quarterly Review. From 1807 until 1816 he lived at St. Mary Cray, Kent, then from 1816 was based mainly in Oxford. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1814. He travelled extensively in France and Italy, where he collated manuscripts of the classics, and spent the winter of 1818 examining the manuscripts in the Laurentian Library at Florence. In 1819 he was commissioned, with Sir Humphry Davy, to decipher the papyri found at Herculaneum, but the results proved insignificant. In 1823 he was appointed principal of St Alban Hall, Oxford, and Camden Professor of Ancient History. He held both of these appointments until his death, from heart disease, at St Alban Hall, on 8 March 1825. Elmsley was a man of great learning and European reputation, and was considered to be the best ecclesiastical scholar in England. He is best known for his collation of the manuscripts of the Greek tragedians, in particular Sophocles and Euripides, and his important work on restoring their text. Editors who have worked in the same field have praised his careful method and diligence in drawing together authorities for the purposes of illustration. He edited The Acharnians of Aristophanes, and several of the plays and scholia of Sophocles and Euripides.

Traditional Chinese theatre, often called Chinese opera, is musical in nature. Western forms like the spoken drama, western-style opera, and ballet did not arrive in China until the 20th century. History Public performance in Jade Dragon Snow Mountain Open Air Theatre. =Earliest Chinese theatre= Theatre in China dates back to as early as the Shang dynasty (16th century BC?– 1046 BC). Oracle bone records reference rain dances performed by shamans, while the Book of Documents mentions shamanistic dancing and singing. For the Zhou dynasty ( 1046 BC – 256 BC), evidence from the Chu Ci suggests that in the 4th or 3rd century BC State of Chu, shamans performed with music and costumes. Some scholars have identified poems from the Classic of Poetry as possible lyrics of songs accompanying court dances from the early or mid- Zhou dynasty. The Zhou royal court as well as the various ancient states employed professional entertainers which included not only dancers and musicians but also actors. The earliest court actors were likely clowns who pantomimed, danced, sang, and performed comedy. One of the most famous actors from this period was You Meng or Jester Meng (優孟), a giant who served King Zhuang of Chu (reigned 613–591 BC). After meeting the impoverished son of Sunshu Ao, the late prime minister of Chu, he is said to have spent a year imitating Sunshu Ao's speech and mannerism. Finally he performed his role at a banquet and successfully appealed to King Zhuang who then granted land to Sunshu Ao's son. Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian contains a passage about Confucius (551–479 BC) explaining the Great Warrior Dance or Dawu Dance (), which told the story of King Wu of Zhou's overthrow of the Shang dynasty in 1046 BC, and how he founded the Zhou dynasty with the help of Duke of Zhou and Duke of Shao. The Great Warrior Dance not only depicted a full story, but was also filled with symbolism, as Confucius explained: Part of a second-century tomb mural from Dahuting which depicts entertainers at an aristocratic banquet. During the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), a wrestling show called Horn-Butting Show () flourished and became one of the so-called \\"Hundred Shows\\" (百戲) under Emperor Wu (reigned 141–87 BC). While most probably this was also a spectator sport, both textual and archaeological evidence suggests that performers were dressed in fixed roles and performed according to a plot. One such story the wrestlers re-enacted was the battle between a tiger and a magician named \\"Lord Huang from the East Sea\\" (東海黃公). Han-period murals discovered from an aristocratic tomb in Dahuting, Xinmi, Henan, offer strong proof that entertainers performed at banquets in the homes of higher- ranking ministers during this period. =Six Dynasties, Tang dynasty, and Five Dynasties= An early form of Chinese drama is the Canjun Opera (參軍戲, or Adjutant Play) which originated from the Later Zhao Dynasty (319–351). In its early form, it was a simple comic drama involving only two performers, where a corrupt officer, Canjun or the adjutant, was ridiculed by a jester named Grey Hawk (蒼鶻). The characters in Canjun Opera are thought to be the forerunners of the fixed role categories of later Chinese opera, particularly of its comic chou (丑) characters. Various song and dance dramas developed during the Six Dynasties period. During the Northern Qi Dynasty, a masked dance called the Big Face (大面, which can mean \\"mask\\", alternatively daimian 代面, and it was also called The King of Lanling, 蘭陵王), was created in honour of Gao Changgong who went into battle wearing a mask. Another was called Botou (撥頭, also 缽頭), a masked dance drama from the Western Regions that tells the story of a grieving son who sought a tiger that killed his father. In The Dancing Singing Woman (踏謡娘), which relates the story of a wife battered by her drunken husband, the song and dance drama was initially performed by a man dressed as a woman. The stories told in of these song-and-dance dramas are simple, but they are thought to be the earliest pieces of musical theatre in China, and the precursors to the more sophisticated later forms of Chinese opera. The Later Tang (923–937) founding emperor Li Cunxu (885–926) — who was of Shatuo extraction — was so passionate about theatre that he enjoyed acting himself. During his reign, he appointed three actors to prefect-ship and in the process alienated his army. In 926, after just 3 years on the throne, he was killed in a mutiny led by a former actor named Guo Congqian. =Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties= In the Song dynasty, there were many popular plays involving acrobatics and music. These developed in the Yuan Dynasty into a more sophisticated form known as zaju, with a four- or five-act structure. Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, the best known of which is Beijing Opera, which is still popular today. =Ming dynasty= Theatre of late imperial China is referred to operas, or xiqu. People during this time had many types of music-related entertainments, and opera was one of them.Lam, Joseph. Culture, Courtiers, and Competition. p. 275 It began to rise during the Yuan period (1279-1368). In the subsequent Ming period (1368-1644), Chinese theatre was divided into three categories by audience: imperial court, social elite, and the general public.Shen, Grant. “Acting in the Private Theatre of the Ming Dynasty,” in HIEA 124 Life in Ming China, edited by Sarah Schneewind, p. 289-311 (Imprints, 2019, p. 290. The actors underwent strict training in singing, dancing, and role-playing techniques. Especially in elite theatre, actors also served as sexual partners for their owners. Play writers in Ming dynasty were mostly educated and hold relatively high social status, unlike those in Yuan dynasty who stayed at the base.王园园, “明代戏曲中女性德行意识” (Female Virtue Consciousness in the Opera of Ming Dynasty), 闽西职业技术学院学报(Journal of Minxi Vocational and Technical College) 2018, 20(04), 80-84 (April 2018). Throughout their education, Confucian ideas are ingrained in their minds, which were then reflected in their writings. As a result, Ming plays often conveyed Confucian teachings, especially in private theatre troupes. For instance, as women desired more equality towards late Ming, Wang Tingne wrote a play called Shi Hou Ji (狮吼记) to educate male authority to women. The Ming imperial court also enjoyed opera. However, most Ming emperors liked to keep their music entertainments inside the palace.Lam, Joseph. Culture, Courtiers, and Competition. p. 290 They performed for the court. Ming theatre had less freedom than the previous dynasty, Yuan.Tian Yuan Tan, “The Sovereign and the Theatre,” in Long Live the Emperor, edited by Sarah Schneewind, p. 149-69 (The United States of America: Society for Ming Studies), p. 150 Some plays included a role of the emperor and was common in Yuan and early Ming.Tian Yuan Tan, “The Sovereign and the Theatre,” in Long Live the Emperor, edited by Sarah Schneewind, p. 149-69 (The United States of America: Society for Ming Studies), p.151 However, Ming Taizu prohibited the actors to impersonate any imperial members, high officials, or well-respected figures. Whoever performed them or allowed such performances were punished severely. However, these restrictions were not always carried out by the public.Tian Yuan Tan, “The Sovereign and the Theatre,” in Long Live the Emperor, edited by Sarah Schneewind, p. 149-69 (The United States of America: Society for Ming Studies), p. 154-62 These theatre troupes targeted at commoners and performed in public. However, due to the Ming’s Confucian influence of gender separation, public theatres were dominated by males.Leung Li, Siu. Cross Dressing in Chinese Opera. p. 57 Private theatre troupes were very prominent during Ming China. Professional public troupes did not thrive until Ming elite class start to collapse.Liu Xuan刘轩,《牡丹亭·写真》昆剧舞台演出史考略(On A History of the Performance of Kunqu Opera Portrait in The Peony Pavilion), 中华戏曲(Chinese Traditional Opera) 2017, (02), 197-213 (February 2017) During Ming time, officials, rich merchants, and eunuchs liked to manage private theatre troupes as a way of entertainment or a sign of status. A female courtesan in late Ming named Ma Xianglan was the only woman who owned a private theatre troupe.Mi Zhao, “Ma Xianglan and Wang Zhideng Onstage and Offstage,” Asian Theatre Journal 34 #1 (Spring 2017). Developing a private theatre troupe was a huge investment. The owners first pick potential actors from poor families or slave households and from performing schools. These families either sell them directly to the theatre owner or to performing school. Since the owners would invest in further training for these people, they did not need much knowledge and skills beforehand. A person’s musical talent and looks are hard to guarantee when they are young, since not everyone grew up to become a successful actor, so some investments did not pay off. When selecting young actors, troupe owners consider looks to be more important than their singing talent, because the chance of having both nice appearance and skills is low, and one could develop singing skills through training. Actors in all three categories had to undergo tedious training. Particularly in private troupes, an actor’s training could take as long as eight years, for children who did not have prior knowledge. Owners could also purchase older children from performing schools and train them from one to three years. The standard for Ming actors includes Cai, Hui, and Zhi. Cai is extraordinary talent, and Hui is the wisdom that enables them to utilize their skills with flexibility. The most important one is Zhi, the ability to combine practical and abstract beauty on stage. As for techniques,the actors needed to excel in singing, dancing, and role-playing. These actors developed outstanding singing and dancing techniques to serve the ultimate goal of creating a character. The most common way was for the leaders to hire music masters to teach them. Some trained actors themselves or coordinated with the professional teachers. The music masters were usually retired actors and taught all three aspects. The actors learn the songs by memorizing what their master teaches them. During the lessons, the master would stop them and correct what they sing wrong. Matching the correct character with each strong beat is necessary for a performer. However, they purposely avoided teaching them script-interpretation and left it to the owners. The owners were well-educated literati and the performers were often illiterate, so the latter might not reach their employer’s standard of interpretation. After these actors became mature in skills, they performed for owners or their guests. The stage was built inside residential halls and half of it was exposed to nature. Performances often utilized natural lighting as part of their stage effect. Some troupes rarely went on public tours for commoners as well. Although these performers contained excellent skills, they were considered as the base people in Ming society. Providing sexual services was a common practice among actors, both heterosexual and homosexual. For instance, a theatre critic described a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old actress as perfect for the bedroom. Some actresses become their owners’ wives. Both males and females served as concubines, and some just sexual partners. During a friends’ gathering theatre night, the elites would each pick their choice for the night. Particularly for females, the audience viewed and actresses’ acting skills as sexually attractive. In some cases, the audience were attracted to the character she created, which was often a famous heroine. They would then ask her to dress like this character so they could fanaticize about having sex with a superstar. Actors could not terminate their relationship with the owner. Instead, their owner could trade his actors with other people or distribute them as gifts. The owner would send actors away for other reasons, such as insufficient finance. The only case in which the actors could control their leave was retirement. The common career span for actors were ten years. When actors passed teens, they had the freedom to retire. =Qing dynasty20th century= Hsiu, sleeve movement  Sleeve movements were an important feature of dancing technique in ancient China and were considered essential to add the grace of the performer. There are many references to the beauty of a dancer's sleeves to be found in old Chinese poems. > \\"What festival is this, with lamps filling in the hall, And golden hair pins > dancing by night alongside of flowery lutes? A fragrance breeze flutters the > sleeve and a red haze arises, While jade wrists flit round and round in mazy > flight.\\"  Shadow play  During the Dynasty of Empress Ping, shadow puppetry first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Pekingese (northern) and Cantonese (southern). The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the puppets, as opposed to the type of play performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather (usually taken from the belly of a peacock). They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the seventh century before becoming a tool of the government. Xiangsheng Xiangsheng is a style of traditional Chinese comedic performance in the form of a monologue or dialogue. Chinese performers usually clap with the audience at the end of a performance; the return applause is a sign of appreciation to the audience. Modern Chinese theatre Modern Chinese theatre and drama has changed quite a lot compared to the past. The influences of the modern world affected the form of music/ theatre/ drama the Chinese were having. The rapid development of the country made theater not as important, as it started to pay focus on its economic environment, not its culture. Although some elderly Chinese try to protect and make the old Chinese theater tradition not fade out, but the fading out of the traditional Chinese is unavoidable. The current Chinese theater has been developed to a new form: people do not watch plays from theater, they watch it at homes on their TV. In addition to music theater, the modern world inspired new forms of drama, including what became known as the spoken drama () of the Western stage.http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199920082/obo-9780199920082-0011.xml See also *List of theatres in China References  * * Fong, Kuang- Yu and Kaplin, Stephen. \\"Theatre on a Tabletop: Puppetry for Small Spaces\\".

Ancient lime plaster often contained horse hair for reinforcement and pozzolan additives to reduce the working time. Traditional non-hydraulic hydrated lime only sets through carbonatation when the plaster is kept moist and access of CO2 from the air is possible. It will not set when submersed in water. When a very thick layer or several layers are applied, the lime can remain soft for weeks. The curing time of lime plaster can be shortened by using (natural) hydraulic lime or adding pozzolan additives, transforming it into artificially hydraulic lime. In ancient times, Roman lime plaster incorporated pozzolanic volcanic ash; in modern times, fly ash is preferred. Non-hydraulic lime plaster can also be made to set faster by adding gypsum. Lime production for use in plastering home-made cisterns (in making them impermeable) was especially important in countries where rain-fall was scarce in summer. This enabled them to collect the winter run-off of rain water and to have it stored for later use, whether for personal or agricultural needs.Eliyahu-Behar, A.; Yahalom- Mack, N.; Ben-Shlomo, D. (2017). \\"Excavation and Analysis of an Early Iron Age Lime Kiln\\", Israel Exploration Journal 67, p. 29  Advantages  Lime plaster sets up to a solid mass that is durable yet relatively flexible. Hydraulic lime plaster is not as hard as cement plaster. Non-hydraulic limes and historic limes were graded as feeble, moderate and eminent. Modern hydraulic limes would be graded at 2, 3.5, or 5 newtons. Portland cement plaster on the other hand would typically be in the region of 25 to 35 newtons when cured; i.e. up to 10 times harder. Lime plaster is less affected by water and will not soften or dissolve like drywall and earthen or gypsum plaster. Unlike gypsum or clay plaster, lime plaster is sufficiently durable and resistant to the elements to be used for exterior plastering. Compared to cement plaster, plaster made from hydrated lime is less brittle and less prone to cracking, requiring no expansion joints. It will not detach from the wall when subjected to shear stress due to expansion inflicted by solar radiation and moisture. Unlike cement plaster, it will shield softer materials from shear stresses. This would otherwise possibly cause the deterioration of the underlying surface. It is usually not recommended to replace more than 20% of the lime content with cement when rendering the facade. Lime plaster is permeable and allows for the diffusion and evaporation of moisture. However, when properly worked with pozzolanic agents and animal fat, it becomes impermeable. The elevated pH of the lime in the plaster acts as a fungicide; preventing mold from growing in lime plaster.  Disadvantages  Non-hydraulic lime plaster sets slowly and is quite caustic while wet, with a pH of 12. Plasterers must take care to protect themselves or use mild acids as vinegar or lemon juice to neutralize chemical burn.Hagsten, Ellen. General Guidelines for Working with Lime Mortar and Limewash, Traditional & Sustainable Building, March 2007 When the plaster is dry, the pH falls to about 8.6. Non-hydraulic lime plaster requires moisture to set and has to be prevented from drying for several days. The number of qualified tradesmen capable of plastering with lime is in decline due to widespread adoption of drywall and gypsum veneer plaster.  Historical use in the arts  One of the earliest examples of lime plaster dates back to the end of the eighth millennium BC. Three statues were discovered in a buried pit at 'Ain Ghazal in Jordan that were sculpted with lime plaster over armatures of reeds and twine. They were made in the pre- pottery neolithic period, around 7200 BC. The fact that these sculptures have lasted so long is a testament to the durability of lime plaster.J.N. Tubb, Canaanites, London, The British Museum Press, 1998  Historical uses in building  * Lime plaster was found to have been a multi-purpose material at the archaeological site of 'Ain Ghazal in modern-day Jordan. The site dates human occupation from 7200 BC to 5000 BC. Lime plaster is believed to have coated internal walls of buildings and to have been used as the main component of some anthropomorphical figurines discovered at the site. * Qadad lime plaster is waterproof and used for interiors and exteriors * Some of the earliest known examples of lime used for building purposes are in ancient Egyptian buildings (primarily monuments). Some of these edifices are found in the chambers of the pyramids, and date to between the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties (~2000 BC). They are still hard and intact. * Archaeological digs carried out on the island of Malta have shown that in places like Tarxien and Hagar, lime stucco was also used as a binder to hold stone together as well as for decoration at sites dating back as far as 3000–2500 BC. * At el-Amarna, a large pavement on brick was discovered that dates back to 1400 BC. It was apparently the floor of part of the harem of King Amenhotep IV.Cowper, Ad. Lime and Lime Mortars, first published for the Building Research Station by HM Stationery Office, London, 1927 * Ancient Chinese used Suk-wui (the Chinese word for slaked lime) in the construction of The Great Wall of China. * Ancient Romans used hydraulic lime (added volcanic ash, an activated aluminium silicate) to ensure hardening of plaster and concrete in cold or wet conditions. * The Aztec Empire and other Mesoamerican civilizations used lime plaster to pave streets in their cities. It was also used to coat the walls and floors of buildings. * This material was used in the San Luis Mission architecture.

The district is a part of Purnia Division. One important thing is Katihar railway station is one of the biggest railway station in Bihar. History Katihar district, which was previously part of Purnia district, is part of the Mithila region. Mithila first gained prominence after being settled by Indo-Aryan peoples who established the Mithila Kingdom (also called Kingdom of the Videhas).Michael Witzel (1989), Tracing the Vedic dialects in Dialectes dans les litteratures Indo-Aryennes ed. Caillat, Paris, pages 13, 17 116–124, 141–143 During the late Vedic period (c. 1100–500 BCE), Kingdom of the Videhas became one of the major political and cultural centers of South Asia, along with Kuru and Pañcāla. The kings of the Kingdom of the Videhas were called Janakas. The Mithila Kingdom was later incorporated into the Vajji confederacy, which had its capital in the city of Vaishali, which is also in Mithila.

His name is Arabic for \\"son of the obligator\\" (the one who divides the inheritance between the inheritors), as his father was well regarded for his work in the legal sphere.Th. Emil Homerin, From Arab Poet to Muslim Saint: Ibn al-Farid, His Verse, and His Shrine (Cairo: American University of Cairo Press, 2001). He was born in Cairo to parents from Hama in Syria, lived for some time in Mecca, and died in Cairo. His poetry is entirely Sufic and he was esteemed as the greatest mystic poet of the Arabs. Some of his poems are said to have been written in ecstasies. The poetry of Shaykh Umar Ibn al-Farid is considered by many to be the pinnacle of Arabic mystical verse, though surprisingly he is not widely known in the West. (Rumi, probably the best known in the West of the great Sufi poets, wrote primarily in Persian, not Arabic.) Ibn al-Farid's two masterpieces are The Wine Ode, a beautiful meditation on the \\"wine\\" of divine bliss, and \\"The Poem of the Sufi Way\\", a profound exploration of spiritual experience along the Sufi Path and perhaps the longest mystical poem composed in Arabic. Both poems have inspired in-depth spiritual commentaries throughout the centuries, and they are still reverently memorized by Sufis and other devout Muslims today.  Biography  Ibn al-Farid's father moved from his native town, Hama in Syria, to Cairo where Umar was born. Some sources say that his father was a respected farid (an advocate for women's causes) and others say that his profession was the allocation of shares (furūḍ) in cases of inheritance. These two can be reconciled, however, by interpreting his name to mean that he often represented women in cases of inheritance. Whichever is the case, Ibn al- Farid's father was a knowledgeable scholar and gave his son a good foundation in belles lettres. When he was a young man Ibn al-Farid would go on extended spiritual retreats among the oases, specifically the Oasis of the Wretches (Wadi al-Mustad'afin), outside Cairo, but he eventually felt that he was not making deep enough spiritual progress. He abandoned his spiritual wanderings and enrolled in a madrasa studying in the Shafi'i school of law. One day Ibn al-Farid saw a greengrocer performing the ritual Muslim ablutions outside the door of the madrasa, but the man was doing them out of the prescribed order. When Ibn al-Farid tried to correct him, the greengrocer looked at him and said, \\"Umar! You will not be enlightened in Egypt. You will be enlightened only in the Hijaz, in Mecca…\\" Umar Ibn al-Farid was stunned by this statement, seeing that this simple greengrocer was no ordinary man. But he argued that he couldn't possibly make the trip to Mecca right away. Then the man gave Ibn al- Farid a vision, in that very moment, of Mecca. Ibn al-Farid was so transfixed by this experience that he left immediately for Mecca and, in his own words, \\"Then as I entered it, enlightenment came to me wave after wave and never left\\". Shaykh Umar Ibn al-Farid stayed in Mecca for fifteen years, but eventually returned to Cairo because he heard the same greengrocer calling him back to attend his funeral. Upon his return he found the greengrocer on the point of death, and they wished each other farewell. Upon Ibn al-Farid's return to Cairo, he was treated as a saint. He would hold teaching sessions with judges, viziers and other leaders of the city. While walking down the street, people would come up to him and crowd around him, seeking spiritual blessings (barakah) and try to kiss his hand (he would respond by shaking their hand). Ibn al-Farid became a scholar of Muslim law, a teacher of the hadith (the traditions surrounding the sayings and life of the prophet Muhammad), and a teacher of poetry. Unlike many other respected poets of the day such as Ibn Sana al-Mulk, Ibn Unayn, Baha al-Din Zuhayr and Ibn Matruh, Ibn al-Farid refused the patronage of wealthy governmental figures which would have required him to produce poetry for propaganda, preferring the relatively humble life of a teacher that allowed him to compose his poetry of enlightenment unhampered. One time al-Malik al-Kamil, who was the Ayyubid sultan at that time, liked some of his odes so much that he sent the poet an exorbitant amount of money and offered to build a shrine for him. Ibn al-Farid declined both the money and the offer of the shrine, choosing to trust in God to supply for his needs. His position as a teacher at the Al-Azhar Mosque allowed him to provide for his family, which included three children. = Death and Burial = Ibn al-Farid died in the Al-Azhar Mosque. He was buried in Qarafah cemetery at the foot of Mt. Muqqattam under the al-Arid mosque. The burial was postponed because the grave was not completely dug. Some said this was to \\"chastise him for claiming such a high status in love\\" while others said it was \\"merely the last indignity that one of God's chosen must suffer from the contingencies of the world below\\".  Ecstasies  During the later part of his life, Ibn al-farid was known to enter into spiritual raptures known as jadhabat in Arabic, a common occurrence in sufism. Normally described as being handsome, his son wrote that when a mystical state overcame him, his face would increase in beauty and brightness. Sweat would pour from his body and collect at the ground beneath his feet, which was a result of jumping and dancing. He would also take forty-day fasts, during which he would neither eat, drink nor sleep. During one particular ecstasy, the Shaykh screamed out and danced in the middle of the market bazaar. Others in the market began to join in and dance with them, causing a commotion with some of them falling on the ground. Ibn al-Farid threw off all of his clothes, an act which members of the crowd repeated. The crowd carried the Shaykh in his underwear to the al- Azhar mosque where he remained in this state for some days afterward. Ibn al- Farid claimed to see many things happen that could be considered to be out of this world. He wrote of a lion kneeling down to him and asking him to ride. He also wrote of seeing a man descending a mountain, floating without using his feet. He claimed that a \\"great green bird\\" came down at the funeral of the greengrocer and \\"gobbled up his corpse\\". He also claimed to have conversed with Muhammad in a dream. Ibn al-Farid's son Kamal al-Din Muhammad described his ecstasies or trances as sometimes lasting ten consecutive days without eating, drinking, moving, speaking or hearing outside noises. He would alternately stand, sit, lie on his side, and \\"throw himself down on his side.\\" When he came to, his first words would be a dictation of the verse God had given him.  Legacy  Every Friday, Cairenes gather at Ibn al-Farid's tomb to listen to readings of his poems. There was once a Sufi order in Egypt in the sixteenth century C.E. called \\"al-Fāriḍīyah\\". It supposedly originated from ibn al-Farid, but is no longer in existence. Due to the subject matter of his poems and the beauty of the verse, Ibn al-Farid later became referred to as \\"sultan al-ashiqin\\" (\\"the sultan of lovers\\"). = Moulid of Ibn al-Farid = There is a moulid of Ibn al-Farid. It begins with a procession starting in Cairo that travels through Mamluk graveyards known as the \\"City of the Dead\\" and ends at Ibn al-Farid's tomb which lies at the base of Mount al-Muqaṭṭam in the sandstone hill area of the Eastern part of Cairo. The moulid continues for two more days of meditations, prayers and dancing. During the procession, some men put skewers through their cheeks. It does not appear that Ibn al-Farid practiced this; the origination of the tradition is unknown. It is said though that the spirit of Ibn al-Farid protects the men who do this. The trance-like aspect of the dancing and the procession are connections to Sufi background of Ibn al-Farid. This is one of the smaller moulids in Cairo and is not widely known about among Cairenes; the average participation is a few hundred.

It is frequently referred to as i686. It was succeeded by the NetBurst microarchitecture in 2000, but eventually revived in the Pentium M line of microprocessors. The successor to the Pentium M variant of the P6 microarchitecture is the Core microarchitecture which in turn is also derived from the P6 microarchitecture. From Pentium Pro to Pentium III The P6 core was the sixth generation Intel microprocessor in the x86 line. The first implementation of the P6 core was the Pentium Pro CPU in 1995, the immediate successor to the original Pentium design (P5). P6 processors dynamically translate IA-32 instructions into sequences of buffered RISC-like micro- operations, and then analyze and reorder the micro-operations in order to detect parallelizable operations that may be issued to more than one execution unit at once. The Pentium Pro was not the first x86 chip to use this technique — the NexGen Nx586, introduced in 1994, also used it — but it was the first Intel x86 chip to do so. Some techniques first used in the x86 space in the P6 core include: *Speculative execution and out-of-order completion (called \\"dynamic execution\\" by Intel), which required new retire units in the execution core. This lessened pipeline stalls, and in part enabled greater speed-scaling of the Pentium Pro and successive generations of CPUs. *Superpipelining, which increased from Pentium's 5-stage pipeline to 14 of the Pentium Pro and early model of the Pentium III(coppermine), and eventually morphed into less than 10-stage pipeline of the Pentium M for embedded and mobile market due to energy inefficiency and higher voltage issues that encountered in the predecessor, and then again lengthening the 10- to 12-stage pipeline back to the Core 2 due to facing difficulty increasing clock speed while improving fabrication process can somehow negate some negative impact of higher power consumption on the deeper pipeline design. *PAE and a wider 36-bit address bus to support 64 GB of physical memory (the linear address space of a process was still limited to 4 GB). *Register renaming, which enabled more efficient execution of multiple instructions in the pipeline. *CMOV instructions heavily used in compiler optimization. *Other new instructions: FCMOV, FCOMI/FCOMIP/FUCOMI/FUCOMIP, RDPMC, UD2. *New instructions in Pentium II Deschutes core: MMX, FXSAVE, FXRSTOR. *New instructions in Pentium III: SSE. The P6 architecture lasted three generations from the Pentium Pro to Pentium III, and was widely known for low power consumption, excellent integer performance, and relatively high instructions per cycle (IPC). The P6 line of processing cores was succeeded with the NetBurst (P68) architecture which appeared with the introduction of Pentium 4. This was a completely different design based on the use of very long pipelines that favoured high clock speed at the cost of lower IPC, and higher power consumption. =P6 based chips= *Celeron (Covington/Mendocino/Coppermine/Tualatin variants) *Pentium Pro *Pentium II Overdrive (a Pentium II chip in the 387 pin Socket 8) *Pentium II *Pentium II Xeon *Pentium III *Pentium III Xeon P6 Variant Pentium M Upon release of the Pentium 4-M and Mobile Pentium 4, it was quickly realized that the new mobile NetBurst processors were not ideal for mobile computing. The Netburst- based processors were simply not as efficient per clock or per watt compared to their P6 predecessors. Mobile Pentium 4 processors ran much hotter than Pentium III-M processors and didn't offer significant performance advantages. Its inefficiency affected not only the cooling system complexity, but also the all-important battery life. Realizing their new microarchitecture wasn't the best choice for the mobile space, Intel went back to the drawing board for a design that would be optimally suited for this market segment. The result was a modernized P6 design called the Pentium M: Design OverviewLal Shimpi, Anand. Intel's 90nm Pentium M 755: Dothan Investigated, AnandTech, July 21, 2004. *Quad-pumped Front Side Bus. With the initial Banias core, Intel adopted the 400 MT/s FSB first used in Pentium 4. The Dothan core moved to the 533 MT/s FSB, following Pentium 4's evolution. *Larger L1/L2 cache. L1 cache increased from predecessor's 32 KB to current 64 KB in all models. Initially 1 MB L2 cache in the Banias core, then 2 MB in the Dothan core. Dynamic cache activation by quadrant selector from sleep states. *SSE2 Streaming SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) Extensions 2 support. *A 10- or 12-stage Enhanced instruction pipeline that allows for higher clock speeds without lengthening the pipeline stage, reduced from 14 stage on Pentium Pro/II/III. *Dedicated register stack management. *Addition of global history, indirect prediction, and loop prediction to branch prediction table. Removal of local prediction. *Micro-ops Fusion of certain sub-instructions mediated by decoding units. x86 commands can result in fewer RISC micro-operations and thus require fewer processor cycles to complete. The Pentium M was the most power efficient x86 processor for notebooks for several years, consuming a maximum of 27 watts at maximum load and 4-5 watts while idle. The processing efficiency gains brought about by its modernization allowed it to rival the Mobile Pentium 4 clocked over 1 GHz higher (the fastest-clocked Mobile Pentium 4 compared to the fastest-clocked Pentium M) and equipped with much more memory and bus bandwidth. The first Pentium M family processors (\\"Banias\\") internally support PAE but do not show the PAE support flag in their CPUID information; this causes some operating systems (primarily Linux distributions) to refuse to boot on such processors since PAE support is required in their kernels.PAE - Ubuntu Community Help Wiki =Banias/Dothan variant= *Celeron M (Banias/Shelton/Dothan variants) *Pentium M *A100/A110 *EP80579 *CE 3100 P6 Variant Enhanced Pentium M The Yonah CPU was launched in January 2006 under the Core brand. Single and dual-core mobile version were sold under the Core Solo, Core Duo, and Pentium Dual-Core brands, and a server version was released as Xeon LV. These processors provided partial solutions to some of the Pentium M's shortcomings by adding: *SSE3 Support *Single- and dual-core technology with 2 MB of shared L2 cache (restructuring processor organization) *Increased FSB speed, with the FSB running at 533 MT/s or 667 MT/s. *A 12-stage instruction pipeline. This resulted in the interim microarchitecture for low-voltage only CPUs, part way between P6 and the following Core microarchitecture. =Yonah variant= *Celeron M 400 series *Core Solo/Duo *Pentium Dual-Core T2060/T2080/T2130 *Xeon LV/ULV (Sossaman)  Roadmap Successor= On July 27, 2006, the Core microarchitecture, a derivative of P6, was launched in form of the Core 2 processor. Subsequently, more processors were released with the Core microarchitecture under Core 2, Xeon, Pentium and Celeron brand names. The Core microarchitecture is Intel's final mainstream processor line to use FSB, with all later Intel processors based on Nehalem and later Intel microarchitectures featuring an integrated memory controller and a QPI or DMI bus for communication with the rest of the system. Improvements relative to the Intel Core processors were: *A 14-stage instruction pipeline that allows for higher clock speeds. *SSE4.1 support for all Core 2 models manufactured at a 45 nm lithography. *Support for the 64-bit x86-64 architecture, which was previously only offered by Prescott processors, the Pentium 4 last architectural installment. *Increased FSB speed, ranging from 533 MT/s to 1600 MT/s. *Increased L2 cache size, with the L2 cache size ranging from 1 MB to 12 MB (Core 2 Duo processors use a shared L2 cache while Core 2 Quad processors having half of the total cache is shared by each core pair). *Dynamic Front Side Bus Throttling (some mobile models), where the speed of the FSB is reduced in half, which by extension reduces the processor's speed in half. Thus the processor goes to a low power consumption mode called Super Low Frequency Mode that helps extend battery life. *Dynamic Acceleration Technology for some mobile Core 2 Duo processors, and Dual Dynamic Acceleration Technology for mobile Core 2 Quad processors. Dynamic Acceleration Technology allows the CPU to overclock one processor core while turning off the one. In Dual Dynamic Acceleration Technology two cores are deactivated and two cores are overclocked. This feature is triggered when an application only uses a single core for Core 2 Duo or up to two cores for Core 2 Quad. The overclocking is performed by increasing the clock multiplier by 1. While all these chips are technically derivatives of the Pentium Pro, the architecture has gone through several radical changes since its inception.Pat Gelsinger talk at Stanford, Jun 7th 2006 See also * List of Intel CPU microarchitectures References P6 Category:Intel microarchitectures Category:Superscalar microprocessors ","title":"P6 (microarchitecture)"},{"id":"2467056","text":"Otto Brahm (born Otto Abrahamson on 5 February 1856 in Hamburg; died 28 November 1912 in Berlin) was a German drama and literary critic, theatre manager and director. His productions were noted for being accurate and realistic. He was involved in the foundation of the progressive Die Freie Bühne (English: Free Stage) company, of which he became president and producer. He also edited the company's weekly magazine of the same name, but later changed its name to Die neue Rundschau. Brahm also managed the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, and was responsible for modernising its output. From Heinz Herald's memoir of Max Reinhardt entitled Bildnis Eines Theater-Mannes, regarding the birth of modern theatre: > In Germany, the explosion came in 1889, embodied by Otto Brahm. Her place > was the newly grounded vacant stage, her occasion is the premiere of a young > unknown poet. His name was Gerhart Hauptmann, his play Before Sunrise. > Opinions collapsed, as the representatives of a tradition-bound art > calcified with the glowing, indomitable, new style. A well-known Berlin > doctor swung a symbolic and a little rude noose after the curtain had > fallen. A battle raged, but soon it became clear as day that naturalism had > triumphed here on the whole line. The confirmation of this victory occurred when Brahm shortly afterwards took over the direction of the Deutsches Theater, which at that time was still considered to be the leader in Berlin and the Reich. But even Otto Brahm could not fulfill the theoretical ideal of consistent naturalism because it was and is unfulfillable. . . . Art, even naturalistic art, is a choice, omission. The verdict that was literally painted on Brahm’s stage, \\"art and nature are one only,\\" could not be realized. Brahm saw this too soon. His house-poets, led by Ibsen and Hauptmann, supplied him with pieces that one could by no means call naturalistic. They used more naturalistic means, but they also omitted and increased. . . . . [However] there was no longer a stilted language, no idealized decoration, no off-the-ground stage style. The Brahms theater was true, honest, decent, manly. One did not pretend in Brahm’s theatre, one played as lifelike as possible. A great ensemble helped Otto Brahm with this effort. Every time an elementary new stage personality appears, a keen actor seems to form itself around this center. Here were the best Rittner, Sauer, Hermann Muller, Bassermann and Else Lehmann: performers who met exactly the Brahmian style of the naturalness, truthfulness, sober behavior. Through hotly controversial Hauptmann's first performances and many pieces of the naturalistic period, Brahm and his cast rose to what they undoubtedly considered to be the pinnacle of their achievement: the peculiar and pompous cycle of Ibsen. [However], Brahm was not a director. This position, which is unknown in our current sense, was more the role of a subaltern. Brahm sat in on the rehearsals in the dark auditorium and tried to bring his actors to where he wanted them by talking after rehearsing. He was a brilliant dramaturg. He was in close contact with his authors, selected the pieces for his playing schedule, occupied them, found and hired new ensemble members. A young actor of his theater, who had noticed him on a short visit to Salzburg and stayed with him for almost a decade, was called Max Reinhardt.” 12-14 See also * Oskar Seidlin External links * Jewish Encyclopedia Category:1856 births Category:1912 deaths Category:19th-century theatre Category:German Jews Category:German literary critics Category:German theatre directors Category:German theatre managers and producers Category:People from Hamburg Category:German male non-fiction writers ","title":"Otto Brahm"},{"id":"2467058","title":"Peter McConnell"},{"id":"2467068","text":"Nawada district is one of the thirty-eight districts of the Indian state of Bihar.

Formerly, sugar cane farming and processing also took place; the district's single sugar mill, located in Warisaliganj, is currently non-functional. Kadirganj, located 10 km from Nawada, has a silk small scale industry where workers clean and weave silk. Rajauli Hisua and Warsaliganj are emerging as significant market hubs for the hinterland regions bordering Jharkhand state, and have also produced many professionals including physicians, surgeons, engineers who are working in many parts of India. The Nuclear Power Corporation of India identified Rajauli as the possible site for creating an additional 2,800 MW of nuclear power capacity in the state. In 2006 the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named Nawada one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). It is one of the 38 districts in Bihar currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF). Transport National Highway 20 runs roughly north–south through the western side of district, serving many villages and towns, including the administrative center of Nawada. National Highway 120 follows a 30 km route in the far northwestern corner of the district, passing through the town of Hisua. Including state highways and other routes connecting villages, the district has approximately 420 km of paved roads. Deluxe buses are available from Nawada to major cities, including Patna. The district lies in the East Central Railway of Indian Railways; the Gaya–Kiul line crosses the district roughly east–west, and connects with the Bakhtiyarpur–Tilaiya line at Tilaiya Junction. Two express trains and several local trains run on the Gaya-Kiul line via Nawada railway station. Though electrification is complete, doubling of railway line is under process .

Helmholtz resonance or wind throb is the phenomenon of air resonance in a cavity, such as when one blows across the top of an empty bottle. The name comes from a device created in the 1850s by Hermann von Helmholtz, the Helmholtz resonator, which he used to identify the various frequencies or musical pitches present in music and other complex sounds.Helmholtz, Hermann von (1885), On the sensations of tone as a physiological basis for the theory of music, Second English Edition, translated by Alexander J. Ellis. London: Longmans, Green, and Co., p. 44. Retrieved 2010-10-12.  History  A selection of Helmholtz resonators from 1870, at Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery in Glasgow. Helmholtz described in his 1862 book On the Sensations of Tone an apparatus able to pick out specific frequencies from a complex sound. The Helmholtz resonator, as it is now called, consists of a rigid container of a known volume, nearly spherical in shape, with a small neck and hole in one end and a larger hole in the other end to emit the sound. When the resonator's 'nipple' is placed inside one's ear, a specific frequency of the complex sound can be picked out and heard clearly. In his book Helmholtz’ explains: When we \\"apply a resonator to the ear, most of the tones produced in the surrounding air will be considerably damped; but if the proper tone of the resonator is sounded, it brays into the ear most powerfully…. The proper tone of the resonator may even be sometimes heard cropping up in the whistling of the wind, the rattling of carriage wheels, the splashing of water.\\" A set of varied size resonators was sold to be used as discrete acoustic filters for the spectral analysis of complex sounds. There is also an adjustable type, called a universal resonator, which consists of two cylinders, one inside the other, which can slide in or out to change the volume of the cavity over a continuous range. An array of 14 of this type of resonator has been employed in a mechanical Fourier sound analyzer. This resonator can also emit a variable-frequency tone when driven by a stream of air in the \\"tone variator\\" invented by William Stern, 1897. When air is forced into a cavity, the pressure inside increases. When the external force pushing the air into the cavity is removed, the higher-pressure air inside will flow out. Due to the inertia of the moving air the cavity will be left at a pressure slightly lower than the outside, causing air to be drawn back in. This process repeats, with the magnitude of the pressure oscillations increasing and decreasing asymptotically after the sound starts and stops. The port (the neck of the chamber) is placed in the external meatus of the ear, allowing the experimenter to hear the sound and to determine its loudness. The resonant mass of air in the chamber is set in motion through the second hole, which is larger and doesn't have a neck. A gastropod seashell can form a Helmholtz resonator with low Q factor, amplifying many frequencies, resulting in the \\"sounds of the sea\\". The term Helmholtz resonator is now more generally applied to include bottles from which sound is generated by blowing air across the mouth of the bottle. In this case the length and diameter of the bottle neck also contribute to the resonance frequency and its Q factor. By one definition a Helmholtz resonator augments the amplitude of the vibratory motion of the enclosed air in a chamber by taking energy from sound waves passing in the surrounding air. In the other definition the sound waves are generated by a uniform stream of air flowing across the open top of an enclosed volume of air.  Quantitative explanation  It can be shown that the resonant angular frequency is given by: :\\\\omega_{H} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma\\\\frac{A^2}{m} \\\\frac{P_0}{V_0}} (rad/s), where: *\\\\gamma (gamma) is the adiabatic index or ratio of specific heats. This value is usually 1.4 for air and diatomic gases. * A is the cross-sectional area of the neck; *m is the mass in the neck; * P_0 is the static pressure in the cavity; * V_0 is the static volume of the cavity. For cylindrical or rectangular necks, we have : A = \\\\frac{V_n}{L_{eq}} , where: * L_{eq} is the equivalent length of the neck with end correction, which can be calculated as : L_{eq} = L_n + 0.3 D , where L_n is the actual length of the neck and D is the hydraulic diameter of the neck; * V_n is the volume of air in the neck, thus: :\\\\omega_{H} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma\\\\frac{A}{m} \\\\frac{V_n}{L_{eq}} \\\\frac{P_0}{V_0}}. From the definition of mass density ({\\\\rho}): \\\\frac{V_n}{m} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} . The speed of sound in a gas is given by: : v = \\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma\\\\frac{P_0}{\\\\rho}} , thus, the resonance frequency is: :f_{H} = \\\\frac{v}{2\\\\pi}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{A}{V_0 L_{eq}}}. The length of the neck appears in the denominator because the inertia of the air in the neck is proportional to the length. The volume of the cavity appears in the denominator because the spring constant of the air in the cavity is inversely proportional to its volume. The area of the neck matters for two reasons. Increasing the area of the neck increases the inertia of the air proportionately, but also decreases the velocity at which the air rushes in and out. Depending on the exact shape of the hole, the relative thickness of the sheet with respect to the size of the hole and the size of the cavity, this formula can have limitations. More sophisticated formulae can still be derived analytically, with similar physical explanations (although some differences matter). See for example the book by F. Mechels.Formulas of Acoustics Furthermore, if the mean flow over the resonator is high (typically with a Mach number above 0.3), some corrections must be applied. Applications Helmholtz resonance finds application in internal combustion engines (see airbox), subwoofers and acoustics. Intake systems described as 'Helmholtz Systems' have been used in the Chrysler V10 engine built for both the Dodge Viper and the Ram pickup truck, and several of the Buell tube-frame series of motorcycles. In stringed instruments as old as the veena or sitar, or as recent as the guitar and violin, the resonance curve of the instrument has the Helmholtz resonance as one of its peaks, along with other peaks coming from resonances of the vibration of the wood. An ocarina is essentially a Helmholtz resonator where the combined area of the opened finger holes determines the note played by the instrument. The West African djembe is the original Helmholtz resonator with a small neck area, giving it a deep bass tone. It has been in use for thousands of years. Conversely, the human mouth is effectively a Helmholtz resonator when it is used in conjunction with a jaw harp, shepherd's whistle, nose whistle, nose flute. The nose blows air through an open nosepiece, into an air duct, and across an edge adjacent to the open mouth, creating the resonator. The volume and shape of the mouth cavity augments the pitch of the tone. The theory of Helmholtz resonators is used in motorcycle and car exhausts to alter the sound of the exhaust note and for differences in power delivery by adding chambers to the exhaust. Exhaust resonators are also used to reduce potentially loud and obnoxious engine noise where the dimensions are calculated so that the waves reflected by the resonator help cancel out certain frequencies of sound in the exhaust. In some two-stroke engines, a Helmholtz resonator is used to remove the need for a reed valve. A similar effect is also used in the exhaust system of most two- stroke engines, using a reflected pressure pulse to supercharge the cylinder (see Kadenacy effect.) Vitruvius, a 1st-century B.C. Roman architect, described the use of bronze or pottery resonators in classical theater design.:Wikisource:Ten Books on Architecture/Book V, Chapter V: \\" Sounding Vessels in the Theater\\". (full text link) Helmholtz resonators are used in architectural acoustics to reduce undesirable low frequency sounds (standing waves, etc.) by building a resonator tuned to the problem frequency, thereby eliminating it. Helmholtz resonance is also used in Bass-reflex speaker enclosures, with the compliance of the air mass inside the enclosure and the mass of air in the port forming a helmholtz resonator. By tuning the resonant frequency of the helmholtz resonator to the lower end of the loudspeaker's usable frequency range, the speaker's low-frequency performance is improved. Helmholtz resonators are also used to build acoustic liners for reducing the noise of aircraft engines, for example. These acoustic liners are made of two components: * a simple sheet of metal (or other material) perforated with little holes spaced out in a regular or irregular pattern; this is called a resistive sheet; * a series of so-called honeycomb cavities (holes with a honeycomb shape, but in fact only their volume matters). Such acoustic liners are used in most of today's aircraft engines. The perforated sheet is usually visible from inside or outside the airplane; the honeycomb is just under it. The thickness of the perforated sheet is of importance, as shown above. Sometimes there are two layers of liners; they are then called \\"2-DOF liners\\" (DOF meaning Degrees Of Freedom), as opposed to \\"single DOF liners\\". This effect might also be used to reduce skin friction drag on aircraft wings by 40%. Helmholtz resonance sometimes occurs when a slightly open single car window makes a very loud sound, also called side window buffeting or wind throb. Helmholtz resonance is one of the principles behind the way piezoelectric buzzers work: a piezoelectric disc acts as the excitation source, but it relies on the acoustic cavity resonance to produce an audible sound.

Some of Agat's most notable sites are Mount Alifan, the Agat Marina, the Spanish Bridge, and War In The Pacific National Historical Park.  History  Marines cross a bridge in Agat during the liberation of Guam in 1944. In 1565, the Spanish explorer Miguel López de Legazpi claimed Guam for Spain. Agat was founded between 1680 and 1684, by the Spanish Governor Don Jose Quiroga, as a military garrison for the purpose of controlling the Chamorro people and converting them to Christianity. Many of its first citizens were brought from the internal village of Fina which was destroyed while the Spanish pacified the island. It was one of six such settlements on Guam in the 18th century. During the 1830s, the Spanish Governor, Captain Villalobos, began constructing facilities in Agat planning to make it the island's new capital. Lack of funds prevented him from completing the project. In 1898, Guam was transferred from Spain to the United States following the Spanish–American War. Under U.S. Naval administration, Agat was incorporated as a township with an American style municipal government. During World War II, Japan occupied Guam from 1941 to 1944. During the Battle of Guam in 1944, Agat was one of the two landing sites for U.S. Marines. These sites are now part of the War in the Pacific National Historical Park. The old village was destroyed during the invasion. After capturing Guam, the U.S. military constructed a new residential community in Agat for Guam residents made homeless by the war south of the original village.

People with vintage, classic, tricked-out, or otherwise interesting cars cruise through the main thoroughfare of Fort St M-85 to crowds of spectators lining Fort St. The Downriver Cruise takes place the last Saturday in June and widely promoted by the Southern Wayne County Regional Chamber of Commerce. The event was spearheaded by state Rep. Edward Clemente (D-Lincoln Park), who was the chamber president at the time, Craig Sochocki, the former mayor of Lincoln Park, Donald W.

Cairns first conceived Cruisin' Downriver in 2000 after her son Glen stated the Woodward Dream Cruise was too far for him to take his Ford Model A. Ultimately, the first Downriver Cruise was held that year and attended by an estimated 200,000 people. The cruise stretches between Sibley Road in Riverview and Outer Drive in Lincoln Park and additionally passes through the cities of Southgate and Wyandotte. An official event for most of its history, each event held since 2017 has been unofficial as a result of increasing expenses incurred and lack of profits by each of the communities along the cruise route. The 2017 and 2018 events had another factor, in the form of increased traffic along Fort Street due to a prolonged partial closure of Interstate 75, which parallels Fort Street in the Downriver area, during those two years. Although I-75 had since fully reopened by the time of the 2019 edition, the event remains unofficial, and this status has allowed the 2020 edition to continue to move forward in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was established under the leadership of Mannathu Padmanabha Pillai. The NSS is a three-tier organisation with Karayogams at the base level, Taluk Unions at the intermediate level and a central headquarters operating from Perunna, Changanassery in Kerala. G. Sukumaran Nair is the present General Secretary. The Society owns and manages many educational institutions, hospitals, hostels and agricultural estates. Origins Mannathu Padmanabha Pillai, social reformer, freedom fighter and the founder of the Nair Service Society The Nair Service Society was formed on 31 October 1914 as a reaction to perceived communal slights in the princely state of Travancore in southern India, which now forms a part of the state of Kerala. At the time of formation, K. Kelappan was the president and Mannathu Padmanabhan was the secretary. Nairs were the most economically and socially dominant community, as well as the most numerous, in what was traditionally a staunchly Hindu kingdom that rigorously and officially enforced distinctions between castes. Some Nairs had felt provoked by the rise to prominence of the Saint Thomas Christians during the era of British rule and whose members were being elected as chairs of various official bodies during a period when the political systems were being modified. The Nairs believed Travancore to be a Hindu state and the founders of the NSS believed that their own community could only counter the changing socio-political situation if it presented a united front and did away with its internal social subdivisions. The first caste association of this type to have been formed in the region was the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP), established in 1903 to work for the benefit of the Ezhava community. Branches Expatriate Nairs both in other states of India as well as in foreign countries have formed Nair Service Societies in their states and countries of domicile. Examples are Karnataka Nair Service Society with 30 Karayogams and the Kanyakumari Nair Service Society with 27 Karayogams, NSS Vidarbha, which unites Nairs living in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. NSS is also having branches in Nagpur, Chandrapur and NSS of North America (NSSONA) with many Karayogams in North America. In 2010 October, Nair organisations from around the world decided to form a united body. As a result, the Global Nair Service Society was founded after a meeting attended by thousands in New Delhi. Strength the NSS comprised: * Taluk Unions : 58 * Karayogams (village/urban communities) : 5300 * Vanitha Samajams : 4232 * Bala Samajams : 2466 NSS has also started many schools under its supervision directly and also under many of its units like Taluk Unions and Karayogams.

Moore, CV-01-T-1268-N, and its companion case Maddox and Howard v. Moore, CV-01-T-1269-N, 229 F. Supp. 2d 1290 (M.D. Ala. 2002), affirmed, 335 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir. 2003), concern then-Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy S. Moore and a 2 ton granite monument of the Ten Commandments in the rotunda of the Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building in Montgomery, Alabama. Background When Judge Moore was a circuit court judge, he became famous for his fights over the display of the Ten Commandments in his courtroom. On August 1, 2001, Chief Justice Roy Moore unveiled a 5,280-pound (2,400 kg) block of granite with the Ten Commandments engraved on it, installed during the middle of the preceding night without the consent of the Supreme Court of Alabama Associate Justices.Glassroth, 229 F. Supp. 2d at 1294. A group of lawyers consisting of Stephen R. Glassroth, Melinda Maddox and Beverly Howard, who felt their clients might not receive fair treatment if they did not share Moore's religious opinion, and that the placement of the monument violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, filed civil suits in Federal Court against Justice Moore in his official capacity as Chief Justice to have the monument removed. District Court proceedings The trial began on October 15, 2002. Evidence for the plaintiffs included testimony that lawyers of different religious beliefs had changed their work practices, including routinely avoiding visiting the court building to avoid passing by the monument, and testimony that the monument created a religious atmosphere, with many people using the area for prayer. Moore argued that he would not remove the monument, as doing so would violate his oath of office: > [The monument] serves to remind the Appellate Courts and judges of the > Circuit and District Court of this State and members of the bar who appear > before them, as well as the people of Alabama who visit the [Heflin-Torbert > Judicial Building], of the truth stated in the Preamble to the Alabama > Constitution that in order to establish justice we must invoke 'the favor > and guidance of almighty God'. On this note, Moore said that the Ten Commandments are the \\"moral foundation\\" of U.S. law, stating that in order to restore this foundation, \\"we must first recognize the source from which all morality springs ... [by] recogniz[ing] the sovereignty of God.\\" He added that the addition of the monument to the state judiciary building marked \\"the beginning of the restoration of the moral foundation of law to our people\\" and \\"a return to the knowledge of God in our land\\". Additionally, Moore acknowledged an explicit theistic intent in placing the monument, agreeing that the monument \\"reflects the sovereignty of God over the affairs of men\\" and \\"acknowledge[s] God's overruling power over the affairs of men\\". However, in Moore's view this did not violate the doctrine of separation of church and state; as the presiding judge later summarized it, Moore argued that \\"the Judeo-Christian God reigned over both the church and the state in this country, and that both owed allegiance to that God\\", although they must keep their affairs separate. On November 18, 2002, District Court Judge Myron H. Thompson held the monument violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: > If all Chief Justice Moore had done were to emphasize the Ten Commandments' > historical and educational importance ... or their importance as a model > code for good citizenship ... this court would have a much different case > before it. But the Chief Justice did not limit himself to this; he went far, > far beyond. He installed a two-and-a-half ton monument in the most prominent > place in a government building, managed with dollars from all state > taxpayers, with the specific purpose and effect of establishing a permanent > recognition of the 'sovereignty of God,' the Judeo-Christian God, over all > citizens in this country, regardless of each taxpaying citizen's individual > personal beliefs or lack thereof. To this, the Establishment Clause says no. Judge Thompson's decision mandated that Moore remove the monument from the Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building by January 3, 2003, but stayed this order on December 23, 2002, after Moore appealed the decision to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Court of Appeals decision A three-judge panel of the Eleventh Circuit unanimously affirmed the original decision on July 1, 2003, agreeing that \\"the monument fails two of Lemon's three prongs. It violates the Establishment Clause.\\" Additionally, the court noted that different religious traditions assign different wordings of the Ten Commandments, meaning that \\"choosing which version of the Ten Commandments to display can have religious endorsement implications\\". After the decision of the Court of Appeals, Moore did not ask the court for a rehearing, nor did he request the Court of Appeals to stay its mandate pending the filing of a petition to the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. On July 30, 2003, having received no request to stay the mandate, the Court of Appeals issued its mandate to the District Court. Subsequent developments On August 5, 2003, the District Court entered its \\"Final Judgment and Injunction,\\" and enjoined Chief Justice Moore, his officers, agents, servants, and employees and those persons in active concert or participation with him who received actual notice of this injunction from \\"failing to remove, by no later than August 20, 2003, the Ten Commandments monument at issue in this litigation from the non-private areas of the Alabama State Judicial Building.\\" On August 14, 2003, Moore stated publicly that he would not comply with the injunction issued to him by the District Court: > As Chief Justice of the State of Alabama, it is my duty to administer the > justice system of our state, not to destroy it. I have no intention of > removing the monument of the Ten Commandments and the moral foundation of > our law. To do so would, in effect, result in the [be a] disestablishment of > our system of Justice in this State. This I cannot and will not do!In re > Moore (Ala. Ct. Jud. Aug. 22, 2003). The time limit for removal expired on August 20, with the monument still in place in the building's rotunda. As specified in Judge Thompson's order, the state of Alabama faced fines of $5,000 a day until the monument was removed. On August 21, 2003, when Moore failed to comply with the August 5, 2003, Order of the District Court, the eight Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of Alabama, issued an order recognizing that \\"[t]he refusal of officers of this Court to obey a binding order of a federal court of competent jurisdiction would impair the authority and ability of all of the courts of this State to enforce their judgments,\\" and issued an order countermanding the \\"administrative decision of the Chief Justice to disregard the writ of injunction of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama\\" and ordered \\"that the Building Manager of the Alabama Judicial Building be, and the same hereby is, DIRECTED to take all steps necessary to comply with the injunction as soon as practicable.\\"In re Compliance with Writ of Injunction, Order No. 03-01 (Ala.

Twerton is served by bus route 5, operated by First West of England buses in the Bath area. For a time, there was a duplicate Wessex Connect service, operating under the name Royal Bath. This was discontinued in the summer of 2013. Wessex Connect does still operate the circular route 20A/C (the suffixes denoting anticlockwise and clockwise services respectively), a route previously operated by First. Twerton high street houses pubs, a minimarket, a new Morrisons local (as of autumn 2013) formerly Blockbuster, a bakery, and two hairdressing salons. The Whiteway housing estate is located in the south of the Twerton electoral ward. History The Domesday Book of 1086 records that Twerton was held by Nigel de Gournay, who would have won his lands in Englishcombe, Twerton, Swainswick and Barrow Gurney by fighting for William I of England. His original home must have been Gournay, which was half-way between Dieppe and Paris. The parish of Twerton was part of the Wellow Hundred. Thomas de Gournay was involved with the murder of Edward II at Berkeley Castle in 1327.Manco, J. (1995) The Parish of Englishcombe: A History, pp. 2, 4. At the time when Brunel was designing the Great Western Railway, his plan was for the line from Bath to Bristol to go through the centre of Twerton.Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a graphic biography by Eugene Byrne and Simon Burr, 2006 The railway station on the main line, called Twerton-on- Avon, survived until 1917. Twerton was also the terminus of one line of the Bath tramway system until that closed in 1939. St Michael's church was enlarged in 1824 by local architect John Pinch the elder and rebuilt in 1839 by the city architect George Phillips Manners. Twerton Gaol was built by Manners in 1840 and closed in 1878. Only the governor's house survives, now converted into apartments. The author Henry Fielding who wrote Tom Jones lived in Twerton and is believed to have written most of the novel while living there. His house, Fielding's Lodge, was demolished for road improvements by Bath City Council in 1963. Housing shortages and population growth after World War II led to significant building of council housing in Twerton and Whiteway, on a much larger scale than elsewhere in Bath. The demographics of the area reflect that fact, with 48% of households in the ward renting from the council or other social housing bodies, and the ward remaining predominantly working class, in contrast to the rest of the city. The Centurion pub, which was built in 1965, was made a Grade II listed building in 2018. Geography Carrs Woodland is a local nature reserve in the valley of Newton Brook. It includes the notable bath asparagus. Twerton Roundhill is a nature reserve of grassland with a range of wildflowers including greater knapweed and agrimony.

Life Éméric-David was born in Aix-en- Provence. He gained a law degree at the university at Aix-en-Provence in 1775. Destined for the legal profession, and having gone in 1775 to Paris to complete his legal education, he acquired there a taste for art which influenced his whole future career. He went to Italy, where he continued his art studies. He soon returned, however, to his native village, and followed for some time the profession of an advocate; but in 1787 he succeeded his uncle Antoine David as printer to the parlement. He was elected mayor of Aix in 1791, but as the French Revolution worsened for public officials, he moved to Paris and then briefly into hiding during the Reign of Terror. For some time to adopt a vagrant life. When danger was past he returned to Aix, sold his printing business, and engaged in general commercial pursuits; but he was not long in renouncing these also in order to devote himself exclusively to literature and art. Paris became his new home and he resolved to be an art historian. From 1809 to 1814, under the Empire, he represented his département in the Lower House (Corps législatif); in 1814 he voted for the downfall of Napoleon; in 1815 he retired into private life, and in 1816 he was elected a member of the Institute (Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres).

Born without sight to an impoverished family, he taught himself to write and print. He has painted using oil paints for roughly thirty-five years. Using a braille stylus to etch the outline of his drawing, Armağan requires total silence to create art. Oil paint is then applied with his fingers and left to dry fully before a new color is applied. This unique method is used so that colors do not smudge. The art pieces themselves are created without help from any individual. He is also able to create art that has visual perspective. In 2008 two researchers from Harvard, Amir Amedi and Alvaro Pascual-Leone, tried to find more about neural plasticity using Armağan as a study case.Neural and behavioral correlates of drawing in an early blind painter: A case study Both scientists had evidence that in cases of blindness, the \\"visual\\" cortex acts differently from how it acts with the non-blind. Pascual-Leone has found that Braille readers use this very same area for touch. Amedi, together (with Ehud Zohary) at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, found that the area is also activated in verbal memory tasks. When Amedi analyzed the results, however, he found that Armağan's visual cortex lit up during the drawing task, but hardly at all for verbal recall, meaning that some unused visual areas might be used in collaboration with ones needs from the brain. Moreover, in scans that were held while Armağan drew, his visual cortex signals seemed as he was seeing to the extent that a naive viewer of his scan might assume Armağan really could see. Armağan is married and has two children. He has displayed his work at more than 20 exhibitions in Turkey, Italy, China, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. He has appeared several times on television and in the press in Turkey and has been on programs on BBC and ZD. In 2004, he was the subject of a study of human perception, conducted by the psychologist John Kennedy of University of Toronto. In 2009 Armağan was invited by Volvo to paint the new model S60 as part of a social media campaign. His work was documented in a series of videos posted on Volvo's Facebook page.Volvo Facebook fanpage with documentaries The resulting painting of the S60 sold on eBay for US $3,050.

In late medieval Europe, this emblem was considered to be the heraldic arms of God (and of the Trinity). Description This diagram consists of four nodes (generally circular in shape) interconnected by six links. The three nodes at the edge of the diagram are labelled with the names of the three persons of the Trinity (traditionally the Latin-language names, or scribal abbreviations thereof): The Father (\\"PATER\\"), The Son (\\"FILIUS\\"), and The Holy Spirit (\\"SPIRITUS SANCTUS\\"). The node in the center of the diagram (within the triangle formed by the other three nodes) is labelled God (Latin \\"DEUS\\"), while the three links connecting the center node with the outer nodes are labelled \\"is\\" (Latin \\"EST\\"), and the three links connecting the outer nodes to each other are labelled \\"is not\\" (Latin \\"NON EST\\"). The links are non-directional—this is emphasized in one thirteenth-century manuscript by writing the link captions \\"EST\\" or \\"NON EST\\" twice as many times (going in both directions within each link), and is shown in some modern versions of the diagram by superimposing each occurrence of the \\"is\\" / \\"is not\\" text on a double-headed arrow ↔ (rather than enclosing it within a link). So the following twelve propositions can be read off the diagram: * \\"The Father is God\\" * \\"The Son is God\\" * \\"The Holy Spirit is God\\" * \\"God is the Father\\" * \\"God is the Son\\" * \\"God is the Holy Spirit\\" * \\"The Father is not the Son\\" * \\"The Father is not the Holy Spirit\\" * \\"The Son is not the Father\\" * \\"The Son is not the Holy Spirit\\" * \\"The Holy Spirit is not the Father\\" * \\"The Holy Spirit is not the Son\\" The Shield of the Trinity is not generally intended to be any kind of schematic diagram of the structure of God, but instead is merely a compact visual device from which the above statements (contained in or implied by the Athanasian Creed) can be read off. History Earliest attested version of the diagram, from a manuscript of Peter of Poitiers' writings, c. 1210. Petrus Alfonsi's early 12th-century Tetragrammaton-Trinity diagram, a probable precursor to the Shield of the Trinity. From William Peraldus' Summa Vitiorum, c. 1255–1265. Includes e converso (\\"vice versa\\") in the link captions to clarify that links are bidirectional. The precise origin of this diagram is unknown, but it was evidently influenced by 12th-century experiments in symbolizing the Trinity in abstract visual form—mainly by Petrus Alfonsi's Tetragrammaton-Trinity diagram of c. 1109 (and possibly also by Joachim of Fiore's different Tetragrammaton- Trinity diagram of three circles, which in turn led to the Borromean rings being used as a symbol of the Trinity ), in combination with the Athanasian Creed. The Shield of the Trinity diagram is attested from as early as a c. 1208–1216 manuscript of Peter of Poitiers' Compendium Historiae in Genealogia Christi, but the period of its most widespread use was during the 15th and 16th centuries, when it is in found in a number of English and French manuscripts and books (such as the Sherborne Missal), and as part of stained- glass windows and ornamental carvings in a number of churches (many in East Anglia). The diagram was used heraldically from the mid-13th century, when a shield-shaped version of the diagram (not actually placed on a shield) was included among the c. 1250 heraldic shields in Matthew Paris' Chronica Majora, while the c. 1260 allegorical illustrations of a knight battling the seven deadly sins in a manuscript of William Peraldus' Summa Vitiorum, and of a woman penitent fending off diabolical attacks in the De Quincy Apocalypse, show the diagram placed on a shield. In the 15th century, one form of the Shield of the Trinity was considered to be the coat of arms of God (see discussion below). The use of the diagram declined in England with the rise of Protestantism, and from the 17th century to the early 19th century, it was mainly of interest to historians of heraldry; but beginning in the 19th century it underwent a limited revival as an actively used Christian symbol among English-speaking Christians, partly due to being included in books such as the Handbook of Christian Symbolism by William James Audsley and George Ashdown Audsley (1865). Name The only name for this diagram which was in any regular use during the Middle Ages was \\"Scutum Fidei\\" (a Latin phrase meaning \\"Shield of the Faith\\", taken from the Vulgate of Ephesians verse 6:16). For example, in this c. 1247–1258 manuscript of John of Wallingford's writings, the quote from Ephesians 6:16 is placed directly above the diagram. The particular phrase \\"Shield of the Trinity\\", which is now the most common name for the diagram in English, didn't come into regular use until the 20th century. However, it is called in Latin Scutum Sancte Trinitatis or \\"Shield of the Holy Trinity\\" (where sancte is a medieval form for more classical sanctae) on the font in Crosthwaite Church, near Keswick, Cumbria, England. Other variant names are \\"Arms of the Trinity\\", \\"Shield of the Blessed Trinity\\", \\"Emblem of the Trinity\\", \\"Arms of the Faith\\", \\"Emblem of the Holy and Undivided Trinity\\", etc. Variations Some variations of the Shield of the Trinity diagram are shown in the image below: Four variants of the \\"Shield of the Trinity\\" 1833 reconstruction of the Agincourt banner of the Trinity A shield-shaped version of the diagram placed on a red shield (heraldic \\"gules\\") was attributed as the arms of God (and of the Trinity) by heralds in 15th- century England and France. The \\"banner of the Trinity\\" which Jean Le Fevre, Seigneur of St. Remy, and Jehan de Wavrin attest that Henry V of England displayed at Agincourt would have been the same (but with the emblem on a red flag instead of a red shield). This coat of arms was given the following heraldic blazon in \\"On Sacred Heraldry\\" by E.L. Blackburne (attached as Appendix II to Emblems of the Saints, By which they are Distinguished in Works of Art by F. C. Husenbeth, edited by Augustus Jessopp, 3rd.ed. 1882): :Gules, an orle and pall Argent, conjoined and surmounted of four plates, occupying the dexter and sinister chief and the base and fess points respectively; the first inscribed \\"Pater\\", the second \\"Filius\\", and the third \\"Spiritus Sanctus\\", the centre \\"Deus\\"; the connecting portions of the orle between them having the words \\"non est\\", and those of the pall \\"est\\". The diagram on a blue shield (heraldic \\"azure\\") was the coat of arms of the Priory of Black Canons (monastery of Christ Church) near Aldgate in the City of London (see also the 15th-century coat of arms attributed to St. Michael the Archangel and the modern coat of arms of the Anglican diocese of Trinidad shown below). Two of the 13th-century manuscripts have the diagram on a green shield (heraldic \\"vert\\"), which is also found in the coat of arms of Trinity Parish, Jersey shown below. Green is the color of Trinity Sunday or the Trinity liturgical season in some traditions. Other variant forms of the diagram have the lettering on nodes and links with a yellow background color (instead of white), since \\"or\\" (i.e. gold/yellow) is the other heraldic \\"metal\\" color. So the arms attributed to St. Faith in late medieval England consist of a diagram with lettering on yellow, placed on a red or blue shield, while the parish of the Forest, Guernsey uses a diagram with lettering on white or yellow nodes and links, placed on a green shield. In the Middle Ages, the shield-shaped version of the diagram was sometimes imagined as a protective shield wielded by the Archangel Michael, or by an ordinary soul, in the spiritual warfare against dark forces described in Ephesians chapter 6 (as in the c. 1260 allegorical illustrations in manuscripts of Peraldus' Summa Vitiorum and the De Quincy Apocalypse). A symmetrical rounded form of the diagram with one vertex up and two down was apparently popularized in the modern period by the Audsleys' Handbook of Christian Symbolism; this rounded form also occurs with one vertex down and two up. The outer node captions can be reduced to simple initials (\\"P\\", \\"F\\", and \\"SS\\"). On the coat of arms of Trinity Parish, Jersey shown below, all four node captions are reduced to single initials, and in some late medieval English church decorations (such as the bench end at Holy Trinity church, Blythburgh, Suffolk and the font at St John the Baptist church, Butley, Suffolk) the four connected circles are intended as a symbol of the Trinity even when all text is omitted. Obviously, many further slight artistic variations can occur in the relative sizes of nodes and links, their exact placement, in lettering styles, in further decorative elaboration, etc. Occasionally one or more of the outer nodes is drawn as a non-circular shape to fit within a space allotted. Also, the diagram can be color-coded in order to bring out the interrelationships between its elements more clearly; in the version included above, the positive or asserting parts of the diagram are shown in black, while the negative or denying parts of the diagram are in red. This is similar to the version of the Shield of the Trinity present in a 15th- century stained glass window in St. Peter and St. Paul church, Fressingfield, Suffolk, England (where only the positive or asserting parts of the diagram are shown—see link below). Finally, a version of the diagram with translated English-language captions is shown in the illustration above. (For simplicity, the definite article could also be left out of the English translations of the outer node captions, as in the next illustration below.) In the Middle Ages, Latin was the liturgical language and main language of scholarship of Western Europe, so that Latin captions were then most often used (but at least one old rendition of the diagram in another language is attested in the c. 1260 Anglo- Norman French allegorical illustration in the De Quincy Apocalypse). =Orientation of diagram, and placement of outer node captions= As the First Person of the Trinity, the Father is always in the most honorable position in the diagram. So in the form of the diagram with one vertex down, the caption \\"PATER\\" or Father is always placed in the top left node (which is heraldically the top right or \\"dexter chief\\", when considered from the point of view of someone holding the shield from behind). And in the form of the diagram with one vertex up, the caption \\"PATER\\" or Father is always placed in the topmost node. The placement of the captions \\"FILIUS\\" or Son and \\"SPIRITUS SANCTUS\\" or Holy Spirit in the remaining two outer nodes can vary. In the 13th-century versions of the diagram, the caption \\"FILIUS\\" is placed in the bottom node, and often a cross is drawn in the link between the center node and the bottom node, in order to symbolize the idea that the Second Person of the Trinity entered into the world (or that \\"The Word was made flesh\\", as is stated in a Latin annotation on the diagram included in Matthew Paris' Chronica Majora which quotes from the Vulgate of John verse 1:14). However, when this form of the Shield of the Trinity diagram with one vertex down is used after the 13th century, the Son is much more often placed in the top right node, and the Holy Spirit in the bottom node (as shown in the illustrations above). The diagram below shows the earliest and most recent major variants of the \\"Shield of the Trinity\\" diagram: On the left, the form attested in various manuscripts c. 1208–1260 AD, and on the right the form popularized among some English-speaking Protestants in recent years by Paul P. Enns' 1989 book The Moody Handbook of Theology and H. Wayne House's 1992 book Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine. Note that in the 13th-century manuscripts, the cross is often drawn as a detailed artistic illumination of Christ on the cross, which is not attempted here. The earliest and most recent major variations of the \\"Shield of the Trinity\\" diagram. A few authors of 20th-century books on Christian symbolism (such as Edward N. West in Outward Signs: The Language of Christian Symbolism, 1989) have been of the opinion that the form of the diagram with one vertex down and the captions \\"PATER\\" and \\"FILIUS\\" in the two top nodes is more appropriate for Western Christianity with its Filioque, while the form of the diagram with one vertex up represents more closely the doctrine of the Trinity in Eastern Christianity (without the Filioque)—though this hyper-refined interpretation does not agree with 13th- century usage, nor with the use of versions of the diagram with one vertex up by modern Catholics and Protestants. Significance The main achievement of the Shield of the Trinity diagram is to transfer a large part of the essential \\"mystery\\" or \\"paradox\\" of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity from the realm of complex verbal philosophical abstractions and esoteric theological vocabulary to the realm of simple logic, as presented in the relatively easily graspable form of a concrete and conveniently compact visual diagram. It is remarkable as a basically successful attempt, roughly 800 years old, to represent a complex set of abstract concepts in precise graphic form (as opposed to many of the near-contemporary attempts of Joachim of Fiore and Raymund Lull, which were not so successful). Thus it is perhaps one of the oldest widely attested \\"graphs\\", in the sense of graph theory (technically, it is a complete graph on 4 vertices, the same as the vertices and edges of a tetrahedron). Of course, if the diagram is interpreted according to ordinary logic, then it contains a number of contradictions (since the set of twelve propositions listed above is mutually contradictory). However, if the three links connecting the three outer nodes of the diagram to the center node are interpreted as representing a non-transitive quasi-equivalence relation (where the statement \\"A is equivalent to C\\" does not follow from the two statements \\"A is equivalent to B\\" and \\"B is equivalent to C\\"), then the diagram is fully logically coherent and non-self-contradictory. So the medieval Shield of the Trinity diagram could be considered to contain some implicit kernel of the idea of alternative logical systems. Unlike some other logical or mathematical constructs sometimes offered as analogies for the Trinity (such as the Venn diagram and the cube viewed by inhabitants of a two-dimensional plane), the Shield of the Trinity does not too easily lend itself to interpretations that are non-orthodox from the traditional mainstream Christian point of view.

It is located north west of Sevenoaks & south of Orpington, adjacent to the Kent border with Greater London. The village is mostly a ribbon development, surrounded by fields that are a part of the Green Belt. There is mixed arable farming. It is in a hilly, rural location, on the top of the dip slope of the North Downs, and has views over London. The village name has the unusually late, mid-19th century more common spelling Nockholt, and is one of many villages in England with a derivation from oak trees, most a strong departure from today's spelling of oak such as Aike. History The village's name is derived from the Anglo-Saxon āc-holt meaning \\"oak copse\\". Knockholt was included in Orpington Urban District in 1934. When Greater London was created in 1965, as part of Orpington UD, Knockholt was included in the London Borough of Bromley. On 1 April 1969, following a concerted campaign by villagers it was removed from the Borough and returned to Kent, being included in Sevenoaks Rural District. The area of the parish is virtually unchanged since first drawn in the late medieval period.https://www.achurchnearyou.com/search/?lat=51.311086&lon;=0.10619999999994434&place;=ChIJsaHILAVT30cRbH10JP7QdR0&text;= When it temporarily merged into Orpington (in 1934) and fell under Bromley Rural District, it was , 18 more than in 1848.http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10225048 The Ivy Farm Communications Centre at Knockholt Pound was the Radio Intercept Station for the non-Morse radio traffic, known as Fish, decoded by Bletchley Park during World War II. The importance of the station is noted in Paul Gannon's book.Paul Gannon. Colossus: Bletchley Park's Greatest Secret. Atlantic Books, London. 2006 There are two parts to the village, Knockholt, near the church and school and The Pound, near the Three Horseshoes pub, village shop and garage (Ox in Flames). There are two other pubs, the Harrow and Tally Ho, as well as a village club. St Katharine's Church, a Grade II*-listed building, is the Anglican parish church. Near Knockholt Pound is the London Road Evangelical Church, built in the late 19th century as a Methodist chapel. Its registration on behalf of the denomination was cancelled in July 1967, and in August 1968 it was re-registered for Evangelical use. Opposite the parish church is St Katharine's Church of England Primary School. TransportRail= The nearest National Rail station is Knockholt, though it is located away from the village. =Buses= Knockholt is served by London Buses routes R5 & R10 (Mondays to Saturdays) and Go Coach route 3 (Mondays to Fridays). These connect it with areas including Orpington & Sevenoaks. Local activities Knockholt residents host a village carnival every two years, the most recent being in July 2018, and a fireworks night every year, late October to early November. Funds raised through these and other events go to national and local charities. A new regular event in the village is the Knockstock music festival, starting in July 2013 and with plans to run in alternating years when the carnival is not operating. Knockholt Amateur Theatrical Society produce one play and pantomime every year. This charitable society was formed in 1945. Kytens is the local youth amateur theatrical group linked to KATS above. There are many other groups including Bowls, Cricket, Tennis, Horse Riding, Horticulture, Christian Fellowship. This is a popular area for horse riders, walkers, ramblers and cyclists, due to its beauty.

She is known for historically cruising the major rivers that constitute the tributaries of the Mississippi River, particularly in the American South. She was docked in Chattanooga, Tennessee and served as a floating hotel until purchased by the newly formed Delta Queen Steamboat Company. She was towed to Houma, Louisiana, in March 2015 for refurbishing to her original condition. The Delta Queen is long, wide, and draws . She weighs 1,650 tons (1,676 metric tons), with a capacity of 176 passengers. Her cross-compound steam engines generate , powering a stern-mounted paddlewheel. Built in 1927, she is the last surviving steam-powered overnight passenger boat plying the watershed of the Mississippi. She was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989. History The hull, first two decks, and steam engines were ordered in 1924 from the William Denny & Brothers shipyard on the River Leven adjoining the River Clyde at Dumbarton, Scotland. Delta Queen and her sister, Delta King, were shipped in pieces to Stockton, California in 1926. There the California Transportation Company assembled the two vessels for their regular Sacramento River service between San Francisco and Sacramento, and excursions to Stockton, on the San Joaquin River. At the time, they were the most lavishly appointed and expensive sternwheel passenger boats ever commissioned. Driven out of service by a new highway linking Sacramento with San Francisco in 1940, the two vessels were laid up and then purchased by Isbrandtsen Steamship Lines for service out of New Orleans. During World War II, they were requisitioned by the United States Navy for duty in San Francisco Bay as USS Delta Queen (YHB-7/YFB-56). During the war, the vessels were painted battleship gray and used in transporting wounded from ocean-going ships in San Francisco Bay to area hospitals. Three different United States Presidents have sailed on Delta Queen: Herbert Hoover, Harry Truman, and Jimmy Carter. In 1946, Delta Queen was purchased by Greene Line of Cincinnati, Ohio and towed via the Panama Canal and the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers for refurbishment in Pittsburgh. On that ocean trip she was piloted by Frederick Way, Jr. In 1948 she entered regular passenger service, plying the waters of the Ohio, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Cumberland Rivers between Cincinnati, New Orleans, St. Paul, Chattanooga, Nashville, and ports in between. Ownership of the vessel has changed seven times over the last fifty years. In 1966, Congress passed the first Safety at Sea Law that would put the Delta Queen out of business. After consulting with attorney William Kohler, Richard Simonton, Bill Muster, and Edwin \\"Jay\\" Quinby traveled to Washington, DC, to save their boat. As chairman of the board of Greene Line Steamers, Jay Quinby testified before the Senate to ask for an exemption to the law.For details of the Congressional exemption history, see . Greene Line had to renegotiate the exemption every two to four years. The boat's Betty Blake Lounge is named in honor of the woman who rose from public relations officer to savior of the boat when Congressman Edward A. Garmatz, a Democrat who represented Baltimore and was Chairman of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, tried to block the 1970 exemption.For details of the 1970 Save the Delta Queen Campaign, see . Thanks to the efforts of Betty Blake and Bill Muster, the Delta Queen was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and was subsequently declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989. and One unusual feature of Delta Queen is her steam calliope, mounted on the Texas deck aft of the pilothouse. It covers approximately three octaves, and was used to play the ship in and out of her berth while she was docking and undocking. The Master of the Delta Queen sometimes extended this courtesy to other vessels as well. In 1974, Charlie Waller & The Country Gentlemen recorded a song on their Remembrances & Forecasts album written by Leroy Drumm and Pete Goble titled Delta Queen, to which Leroy was inspired to write after having seen her running down the Tennessee River in the early 1970s. Current duty The Delta Queen at the start of the 2004 Great Steamboat Race Majestic America Line most recently operated the vessel. The vessels were purchased from the Delaware North Companies in April 2006. Besides Delta Queen, the company also owned the American Queen and Mississippi Queen, modern steamboats designed along Delta Queens lines but carrying around 400 passengers. The company also owned riverboats that have seen service on the Columbia and Snake Rivers in Oregon and Washington, and the Alaska Inside Passage. Delta Queen cruised the Mississippi River and its tributaries on a regular schedule, with cruises ranging from New Orleans to Memphis to St. Louis to St. Paul to Cincinnati to Pittsburgh, and many more. On some cruises, the vessel probed rivers such as the Arkansas, Red, Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, Black Warrior, Mobile, and more. Delta Queen preparing to disembark from Paducah, Kentucky on October 6, 2007.Delta Queen recreated historic steamboat races each year during the Kentucky Derby Festival, when she raced with the Belle of Louisville on the Ohio at Louisville in the Great Steamboat Race. The winner of the annual race received a trophy of golden antlers, which was mounted on the pilothouse until the next race. They also raced during the Tall Stacks festivals celebrating steamboats, held every three or four years in Cincinnati (Delta Queens former home port). On August 1, 2007, Majestic America Line announced that Delta Queen would cease operations permanently at the end of the 2008 season. The temporary exemption from SOLAS needed to keep Delta Queen running was being ended by Congress. In response to this announcement, in September 2007, the Member of the Scottish Parliament for Dumbarton, Jackie Baillie, backed by 15 other Members, submitted a motion to the Scottish Parliament calling for the preservation of the ship. In the United States, devotees of the boat created a renewed \\"Save the Delta Queen\\" campaign similar to the one undertaken in the 1970s. However, at the end of the 2008 season, Delta Queen ceased all service. On her official website, the Majestic America Line announced it is ending all operations, would not operate in 2009, and that its assets, including all its riverboats, were for sale. On February 11, 2009, Delta Queen arrived in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to become a floating boutique hotel, as it was feared the vessel could be vandalized if she remained in New Orleans. Under lease to Chattanooga businessman Harry Phillips, she was docked at Coolidge Park Landing on Chattanooga's North Shore. The Delta Queen Hotel officially opened for overnight guests on June 5, 2009, offering dining, a lounge, live period music, and theatrical performances, closing to the public in December 2014. The ship is currently owned by Ambassadors International, and is leased and operated by a company called All Aboard Travel, operating as Delta Queen LLC, which began leasing the vessel in August 2010. Ambassadors International listed the ship for sale beginning in late 2008 at a price of $4.75 million, and in November 2010 it was announced that a group called Save the Delta Queen 2010 was planning to place a bid to purchase the ship. If it succeeded, the group would place the ship into operation, carrying only 49 people in order to be exempt from federal fire safety regulations, which apply to ships carrying upwards of 50 people. For a time, with the steamer American Queen turned over to MARAD and Mississippi Queen sold for scrap below New Orleans, Delta Queen was the only steamboat to have been owned by the Delta Queen Steamboat Company (formerly Greene Line Steamers) to remain in service, albeit without running trips. However, as of November 2011, the Great American Steamboat Company of Memphis, Tennessee was booking cruises on American Queen along the Upper and Lower Mississippi River. On May 14, 2013, the bill To amend title 46, United States Code, to extend the exemption from the fire-retardant materials construction requirement for vessels operating within the Boundary Line (H.R. 1961; 113th Congress) was introduced into the United States House of Representatives by Rep. Steve Chabot (R, OH-1). Delta Queen docked in Chattanooga The mayor of Chattanooga, Andy Berke, put into motion a plan to have the Delta Queen removed from its mooring in Chattanooga, as he considered it an \\"obstruction\\". A deadline of September 30, 2013 was given. This dispute seemed to rest on the Delta Queen having not paid its rent, which the owners of the Delta Queen had disputed on their Facebook page. This news was in light of the Delta Queen being honored as a \\"National Treasure\\" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation on September 21, 2013. Congress gave a vote on giving the Delta Queen an exemption to allow it to travel the rivers again in 2013, but the exemption bill failed to pass. The Delta Queen was then bought by the newly formed Delta Queen Steamboat Co. in early 2015. It departed Chattanooga for restoration in New Orleans on March 22, 2015. for repairs and upgrades in Houma, Louisiana. She safely arrived on April 7, 2015, in her temporary slip for restoration. In 2008, the Delta Queen was forced to retire from service when her Congressional Exemption from the 1966 Safety at Sea act expired. The law intended to prohibit ocean-bound vessels from carrying overnight passengers unless completely made of non-combustible materials included the Delta Queen, even though she was never more than several hundred yards (metres) from shore. Congress approved nine exemptions over four decades to allow the Delta Queen to continue operations until 2008. On November 27, 2018, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to reinstate an exemption to allow the Delta Queen Steamboat to return to service after a decade-long retirement.

Early life Emmons was born at Middlefield, Massachusetts, on May 16, 1799, son of Ebenezer and Mary (Mack) Emmons. Emmons entered Williams College at age 16 and graduated with a degree in medicine in 1818. He went on to study medicine at Albany, New York. After graduating, he practiced as a doctor in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. In 1824, he assisted Chester Dewey in preparing a geological map of Berkshire County, in which the first attempt was made to classify the rocks of the Taconic area. He eventually attended the Rensselaer School (now Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) for geology. There, he was inspired by professor Amos Eaton, and graduated in the first class in 1826. While giving much of his time to natural science at Williams College, he also became a professor in chemistry and later obstetrics at Albany Medical College. Geological Survey of New York Emmons was designated by Jules Marcou as the founder of American Paleozoic stratigraphy, and the first discoverer of the primordial fauna in any country. In 1836, he became attached to the Geological Survey of the State of New York, and after a lengthened study, he grouped the local strata (1842) into the Taconic and overlying New York systems. The latter system was subdivided into several groups that were by no means well defined. Emmons had previously described the Potsdam sandstone (1838), and this was placed at the base of the New York system. It is now regarded as Upper Cambrian. In 1844, Emmons obtained fossils in his Taconic system for the first time. The species obtained were found to differ from all then-known Palaeozoic fossils and now represent the primordial group. Marcou advocated for the term Taconic to be generally adopted in place of Cambrian. Nevertheless, the Taconic fauna discovered by Emmons proved to include only the lower part of Sedgwick's Cambrian. Emmons contributed to a series of volumes on the Natural History of New York (1848), writing about agriculture and geological topics. He also issued a work entitled American Geology, containing a statement of the principles of science with full illustrations demonstrating the characteristics of American fossils (1855–1857). The overthrust in New York, which places Lower Cambrian rocks in contact with Middle Ordovician rocks, is known as Emmons' line, formerly Logan's line after William Edmond Logan. This segment is named after Emmons and extends from Canada through Vermont, New York, and farther south. It traverses through the city of Troy, New York and the Poesten Kill Falls and Gorge. He named the Adirondack Mountains (1838) and Taconic Mountains (1844) and acquainted the public with these regions. A scientific disagreement with New York State Geologist James Hall regarding the age of the rocks in the Taconic System led Emmons to leave New York State. Emmons held that the Taconic System rocks were of Cambrian age, but Hall was convinced that they were Ordovician in age. (Emmons was ultimately found to be correct.) As a result of the dispute, Emmons was banned from the practice of geology in the state of New York and sued Hall for slander and libel. In 1851, after losing the lawsuit, Emmons was hired by the state of North Carolina for the newly created position of State Geologist. He continued in that position until his death in 1863, at his plantation in Brunswick County, North Carolina.D. J. Cherniak, Ebenezer Emmons (1799-1863) Adirondack mountain climber Emmons gave the Adirondacks their name in 1838. The name \\"Adirondacks\\" is an Anglicized version of the Mohawk ratirontaks, meaning \\"they eat trees\\", a derogatory name the Mohawks historically applied to neighboring Algonquian tribes due to their practice of eating the buds and bark of trees when food was scarce.Donaldson, Alfred L., A History of the Adirondacks, New York: Century, 1921. OCLC 1383265. (reprint), pp. 34-35 Emmons led the first recorded climb of Mount Marcy on August 8, 1837. His party was looking for the headwaters of the East Fork of the Hudson River which it claimed was at Lake Tear of the Clouds on the mountain. Mount Emmons in the Adirondacks is named for him.

The light-emitting ceramic filament is called a \\"glower\\" The Nernst lamp was an early form of incandescent lamp. Nernst lamps did not use a glowing tungsten filament. Instead, they used a ceramic rod that was heated to incandescence. Because the rod (unlike tungsten wire) would not further oxidize when exposed to air, there was no need to enclose it within a vacuum or noble gas environment; the burners in Nernst lamps could operate exposed to the air and were only enclosed in glass to isolate the hot incandescent emitter from its environment. A ceramic of zirconium oxide - yttrium oxide was used as the glowing rod.Allan Mills, \\"The Nernst Lamp. Electrical Conductivity in Non-Metallic Materials\\". eRittenhouse, Vol.24, No. 1, June 2013. (Text on line) Developed by the German physicist and chemist Walther Nernst in 1897 at the University of Göttingen, these lamps were about twice as efficient as carbon filament lamps and they emitted a more \\"natural\\" light (more similar in spectrum to daylight). The lamps were quite successfully marketed for a time, although they eventually lost out to the more-efficient tungsten filament incandescent light bulb. One disadvantage of the Nernst design was that the ceramic rod was not electrically conductive at room temperature so the lamps needed a separate heater filament to heat the ceramic hot enough to begin conducting electricity on its own. In the U.S., Nernst sold the patent to George Westinghouse who founded the Nernst Lamp Company at Pittsburgh in 1901. Minerals for the production of the glowers were extracted from the company's own mines at the legendary Barringer Hill, Texas (since 1937 submerged beneath the waters of Lake Buchanan). By 1904 a total of over 130,000 Nernst lamps had been placed in service throughout the country. In Europe, the lamps were produced by the German Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG, General Electricity Company) at Berlin. At the 1900 World's Fair held in Paris the pavilion of the AEG was illuminated by 800 Nernst lamps which was quite spectacular at that time. In addition to their usage for ordinary electric illumination, Nernst lamps were used in one of the first practical long- distance photoelectric facsimile (fax) systems, designed by professor Arthur Korn in 1902, in Allvar Gullstrand's slit lamp (1911) for ophthalmology, for projection and in microscopy. After Nernst lamps fell into obsolescence \\"Nernst glowers\\" went on to be used as the infrared-emitting source used in IR spectroscopy devices. (Recently, even this has become obsolete as Nernst glowers have been largely replaced for this purpose by silicon carbide glow bars or \\"globars\\", which are conductive even at room temperature and therefore need no preheating.)

He was a dark horse candidate in 1857. The two principal candidates in the convention that year were Edward D. Holton of Milwaukee and Walter McIndoe of Wausau. Holton's abolitionist passions and his connections with the Milwaukee elite gave him strong support, but McIndoe's more rough-hewn personality resonated better with the frontier character of the state at the time. As such, they split the vote, neither able to garner a majority for the nomination. When it became apparent that the convention was at an impasse, and the delegates were released from their obligation, the votes eventually were cast in favor of Randall, the obvious compromise candidate. Prior to the beginning of the Civil War, he was an ardent abolitionist and proposed that Wisconsin secede from the Union if Abraham Lincoln did not win the presidency.Gayle Soucek, Chicago Calamities: Disaster in the Windy City.

He spearheaded the founding of Pu‘uhonua o Waimānalo, a Hawaiian cultural village and traditional lo‘i kalo (taro paddy) agricultural restoration project in Waimānalo, Hawai‘i. Pu‘uhonua is a Hawaiian word meaning \\"sanctuary\\" or \\"place of refuge\\". The Nation of Hawai‘i group, which administers the village, regards itself as a sovereign government under international law, acting as a successor state to the independent Kingdom of Hawai‘i and therefore not subject to United States rule. Kanahele, like many Hawaiians, claims to be a descendant of King Kamehameha I. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Kanahele became known for militant activism on behalf of Hawaiian sovereignty, publicly resisting U.S. federal and state laws. Activism In 1993--the 100th anniversary of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai‘i, and the year in which the U.S. passed a joint resolution of Congress apologizing for that action--Kanahele led 300 people in an occupation of Makapu‘u beach. After 15 months, Gov. John D. Waihee III proposed a deal: If Kanahele and his group would leave Makapuʻu beach peacefully, the state would give them a 45-acre (18 hectare) parcel above Waimānalo in the foothills of the Ko‘olau Mountains. Kanahele's group signed a renewable 55-year lease at a cost of $3,000 a year, and in June 1994, Pu‘uhonua o Waimānalo came into being. In 1998, Kanahele was sentenced to four months in prison for interfering with U.S. marshals seeking to arrest a federal fugitive. The judge gave Kanahele credit for the three and a half months he spent in prison without bail. The judge also fined him $500 and ordered him to spend another four months under electronic monitoring at his Waimānalo home. In 2002, Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano granted Kanahele a full pardon. Kanahele vowed to avoid all violence. In 2005, Kanehele spoke out against the proposed Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act (S.147, known as the Akaka Bill) pending in the Senate, and called upon Native Hawaiians to establish their own bank. In 2006, Kanehele solicited over 53,000 votes in his bid for a seat in the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. As of 2007, Kanehele had transitioned to a less confrontational activism. Living out of the 45 acres of refuge in Waimānalo, won in the Makapu'u Beach occupation resolution, he had been working as an alternative healer according to a 2007 'where are they now?' interview profile piece in Honolulu Magazine. At the time Pu'uhonua o Waimānalo had begun to live up to its name as a place of refuge for over 80 residents and thriving marijuana grow-op, regulated in part by an elected council of women because the men wouldn't stop fighting amongst each other. Beginning in 2015, Kanahele is the face and advocate for a new crypto currency called Alohacoin. He declared this digital currency the official store of value for the Native Hawaiian People.

Plot  The journalist Ted York (Terence Longdon) is rushed to Haven Hospital with appendicitis. The ambulance gets there at top speed, but only because the driver wants to know the result of a horse race. Ted is given a bed and is instantly smitten with Nurse Denton (Shirley Eaton). The other nurses are incessantly having to respond to the calls of the Colonel (Wilfrid Hyde-White), who has a private room. He is an inveterate gambler and is having his bets placed by Mick (Harry Locke), the orderly. That evening, the boxer Bernie Bishop (Kenneth Connor) is admitted after hurting his hand at the end of a bout. The next day, the Sister (Joan Hickson) galvanises the nurses, orderly and patients for the inspection by Matron (Hattie Jacques). As usual, she is let down by Nurse Dawson (Joan Sims), a clumsy student nurse. Matron checks on the progress of the patients, and speaks to Mr Hinton (Charles Hawtrey), who is forever listening to the radio with his headphones. Mick and the Colonel bet on how long the Matron will take on her rounds. Ted is visited by his editor and agrees to write a series of articles on his hospital experiences. He realises that Nurse Denton is in love with a doctor, but that her interest is not returned. Bernie is told that he will not be able to box for several months at least. Nurse Dawson is sent to ring the bell to signal the end of visiting hours, but she calls for the fire brigade by mistake. The bookish intellectual Oliver Reckitt (Kenneth Williams) is visited by Jill (Jill Ireland), the sister of his friend Harry. They clearly like each other, but are too shy to admit it. Bernie urges Oliver to admit how he really feels about her. Bernie's manager Ginger (Michael Medwin) comes to visit him and tells him that he must try to be more of a showman and not simply go for broke with every match. Nurse Dawson comes in early to sterilise some rubber catheters, but is interrupted by the demanding Colonel. The catheters are put in a kidney dish to boil on the stove. Oliver is furious when the ward has to be cleared and tidied up for Matron's rounds as it upsets his schedule for no obvious purpose. When she arrives everyone begins to smell the forgotten catheters, which by now are burning on the stove. When Matron stops to speak to Oliver, he complains about the disruptive effects that her visits have on the patients. Matron is furious and has the Sister make all the beds again. Jack Bell (Leslie Phillips) arrives to have a bunion removed and is placed on the ward. Jill comes to see Oliver and they admit that they care for each other. She gives him a bar of nougat as a gift, but later that evening it makes him sick. Mr Able complains that he can not sleep as he has been missing his wife. He is put on medication, but it makes him wildly excited and he runs amok in the hospital. Eventually Bernie subdues him with a left hook to the jaw. Bell's operation is delayed, which upsets him greatly as he is planning a romantic weekend. He offers the men in the ward the champagne he was going to drink with his girlfriend. They all get drunk and decide to remove the bunion themselves. The night nurse is tied up and Hinton pretends to be her while the others go to the operating theatre. Jack starts to panic as Oliver prepares to operate, but soon they are all giggling as the laughing gas has been left on. The nurse arrives before any real damage is done. The colonel plays a trick on Nurse Dawson and pins a piece of paper with a large red 'L' on her back. Ted learns that Nurse Denton is applying for a job in America and tries to dissuade her. Jack catches a cold and is told that his operation will have to be postponed yet again. Oliver is discharged and leaves with Jill. Bernie is met by his young son and they leave together. Ted is also discharged and makes a date with Nurse Denton. Nurse Dawson and Nurse Axwell decide to get even with the Colonel and replace a rectal thermometer with a daffodil. Luckily for them, upon her inspection, Matron manages to see the funny side.

If a pure liquid partially dissociates into ions, it is said to be self-ionizing. In most cases the oxidation number on all atoms in such a reaction remains unchanged. Such autoionization can be protic ( transfer), or non-protic. ExamplesProtic solvents= Protic solvents often undergo some autoionization: : 2 + The self-ionization of water is particularly well studied, due to its implications for acid-base chemistry of aqueous solutions. : 2 + : 2 + : 3 + Here proton transfer between two HF combines with homoassociation of and a third to form .

Such atoms enable the formation of singly charged, nonradical ions (which must have at least one odd atomic number atom), which are the most favorable autoionization products. Protic solvents, mentioned previously, use hydrogen for this role. Autoionization would be much less favorable in a solvent such as sulfur dioxide or carbon dioxide which has only even atomic number atoms. =Coordination chemistry= Autoionization is not restricted to neat liquids or solids. Solutions of metal complexes exhibit this property. For example, compounds of the type FeX2(terpyridine) are unstable with respect to autoionization [Fe(terpyridine)2]2+[FeX4]2−.Kamata, K.; Suzuki, A.; Nakai, Y.; Nakazawa, H., \\"Catalytic Hydrosilylation of Alkenes by Iron Complexes Containing Terpyridine Derivatives as Ancillary Ligands\\", Organometallics 2012, 31, 3825-3828.

Although it is stable in the absence of air, it decomposes in hot water and in acid solutions. Structure Raman spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies reveal that the geometry of the dithionite anion is flexible. The dithionite dianion has C symmetry, with almost eclipsed with a 16° O-S-S-O torsional angle. In the dihydrated form (), the dithionite anion has a shorter S-S bond length and a gauche 56° O-S-S-O torsional angle. A weak S-S bond is indicated by the S-S distance of 239 pm. Because this bond is fragile, the dithionite anion dissociates in solution into the [SO2]− radical anion, as has been confirmed by EPR spectroscopy. It is also observed that 35S undergoes rapid exchange between S2O42− and SO2 in neutral or acidic solution, consistent with the weak S-S bond in the anion. Preparation Sodium dithionite is produced industrially by reduction of sulfur dioxide. Several methods are employed, including reduction with zinc powder, sodium borohydride, and formate. Approximately 300,000 tons were produced in 1990. Properties and reactionsHydrolysis= Sodium dithionite is stable when dry, but aqueous solutions deteriorate due to the following reaction: : 2 S2O42− \\\\+ H2O → S2O32− \\\\+ 2 HSO3− This behavior is consistent with the instability of dithionous acid. Thus, solutions of sodium dithionite cannot be stored for a long period of time. Anhydrous sodium dithionite decomposes to sodium sulfate and sulfur dioxide above 90 °C in the air. In absence of air, it decomposes quickly above 150 °C to sodium sulfite, sodium thiosulfate, sulfur dioxide and trace amount of sulfur. =Redox reactions= Sodium dithionite is a reducing agent. At pH=7, the potential is -0.66 V vs NHE. Redox occurs with formation of sulfite: :S2O42- \\\\+ 2 H2O → 2 HSO3− \\\\+ 2 e− \\\\+ 2 H+ Sodium dithionite reacts with oxygen: :Na2S2O4 \\\\+ O2 \\\\+ H2O → NaHSO4 \\\\+ NaHSO3 These reactions exhibit complex pH-dependent equilibria involving bisulfite, thiosulfate, and sulfur dioxide. =With organic carbonyls= In the presence of aldehydes, sodium dithionite reacts either to form α-hydroxy-sulfinates at room temperature or to reduce the aldehyde to the corresponding alcohol above a temperature of 85 °C.J. Org. Chem., 1980, 45 (21), pp 4126–4129, http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo01309a011 Some ketones are also reduced under similar conditions. ApplicationsIndustry= This compound is a water-soluble salt, and can be used as a reducing agent in aqueous solutions. It is used as such in some industrial dyeing processes, primarily those involving sulfur dyes and vat dyes, where an otherwise water-insoluble dye can be reduced into a water-soluble alkali metal salt (e.g. indigo dye). The reduction properties of sodium dithionite also eliminate excess dye, residual oxide, and unintended pigments, thereby improving overall colour quality. Sodium dithionite can also be used for water treatment, gas purification, cleaning, and stripping. It can also be used in industrial processes as a sulfonating agent or a sodium ion source. In addition to the textile industry, this compound is used in industries concerned with leather, foods, polymers, photography, and many others. Its wide use is attributable to its low toxicity at 5 g/kg, and hence its wide range of applications. It is also used as decolourising agent in organic reactions. =Biological sciences= Sodium dithionite is often used in physiology experiments as a means of lowering solutions' redox potential (Eo' -0.66 V vs SHE at pH 7). Potassium ferricyanide is usually used as an oxidizing chemical in such experiments (Eo' ~ .436 V at pH 7). In addition, sodium dithionite is often used in soil chemistry experiments to determine the amount of iron that is not incorporated in primary silicate minerals. Hence, iron extracted by sodium dithionite is also referred to as \\"free iron.\\" The strong affinity of the dithionite ion for bi- and trivalent metal cations (M2+, M3+) allows it to enhance the solubility of iron, and therefore dithionite is a useful chelating agent. =Geosciences= Sodium dithionite has been used in chemical enhanced oil recovery to stabilize polyacrylamide polymers against radical degradation in the presence of iron. It has also been used in environmental applications to propagate a low Eh front in the subsurface in order to reduce components such as chromium. =Photography= It is used in Kodak fogging developer, FD-70. This is used in the second step in processing black and white positive images, for making slides. It is part of the Kodak Direct Positive Film Developing Outfit. =Home= The main use of sodium dithionite at home is as a decoloring agent for white laundry, when it has been accidentally stained by way of a dyed item slipping into the high temperature washing cycle. It is usually available in 5 gram sachets termed hydrosulfite after the antiquated name of the salt. =Laboratory= Aqueous solutions of sodium dithionite were once used to produce \\"Fieser's solution' for the removal of oxygen from a gas stream.Kenneth L. Williamson \\"Reduction of Indigo: Sodium Hydrosulfite as a Reducing Agent\\" J. Chem. Educ., 1989, volume 66, p 359.

The story centers on an elderly hibakusha, who lost her husband in the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki, caring for her four grandchildren over the summer. She learns of a long-lost brother, Suzujiro, living in Hawaii who wants her to visit him before he dies. American film star Richard Gere appears as Suzujiro's son Clark. The film was selected as the Japanese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 64th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot Rhapsody in August is a tale of three generations in a post- war Japanese family and their responses to the atomic bombing of Japan. Kane is an elderly woman, now suffering the consequences of older age and diminishing memory, whose husband was killed in the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. Kane has two children who are both married and both of whom grew up in postwar Japan. She also has a brother now living in Hawaii whose son Clark (played by Richard Gere) has grown up in America. Finally, there are Kane's four grandchildren, who were born after the Japanese economic miracle who have come to visit her at the family country home near Nagasaki in Kyushu. Kane's grandchildren are visiting her at her rural home on Kyūshū one summer while their parents visit Kane's brother in Hawaii. The grandchildren have been charged with the task by their parents of convincing their grandmother to visit her brother in Hawaii. The grandchildren take a day off to visit the urban environment of Nagasaki. While in Nagasaki the children visit the spot where their grandfather was killed in 1945 and become aware, at a personal level, of some of the emotional consequences of the atomic bombing for the first time in their lives. They slowly come to have more respect for their grandmother and also grow to question the morality of the United States for deciding to use atomic weapons against Japan. In the meantime they receive a telegram from their American cousins, who turn out to be rich and offer their parents a job managing their pineapple fields in Hawaii. Matters are complicated when Kane writes to Hawaii telling her American relatives about the death of her husband at Nagasaki. Her own two children, who have now returned from Hawaii to visit her, feel that this action will be viewed by their now Americanized relatives in Hawaii as hostile and a source of friction. Clark, who is Kane's nephew, then travels to Japan to be with Kane for the memorial service of her husband's death at Nagasaki. Kane reconciles with Clark over the bombing. Clark is much moved by the events he sees in the Nagasaki community at the time of the memorial events surrounding the deaths which are annually remembered following the bombing of Nagasaki. Especially significant to Clark is the viewing of a Buddhist ceremony where the local community of Nagasaki meets to remember those who had died when the bomb was dropped. Suddenly, Clark receives a telegram telling him that his father, Kane's brother, has died in Hawaii and he is forced to return there for his father's funeral. Kane's mental health and memory begin to falter. Her recollections of her lost spouse have never been fully reconciled within her own memory of her lost loved one. She begins to show signs of odd behavior in laying out her husband's old clothing as if her husband might suddenly reappear and need them to put on. When a storm is brewing, her mental health seems to confuse the storm for an air raid warning of another atomic bomb attack and she seeks to protect her visiting grandchildren by employing folk remedies, which confuse her children and especially her grandchildren. As the storm later intensifies again, Kane becomes more disoriented and mistakenly confuses the storm for the atmospheric disturbance caused by the bombing of Nagasaki which she witnessed visually from a safe distance when her husband was killed many years ago. In her disoriented state, Kane decides that she must save her husband, still alive in her memory, from the impending atomic blast. With all her remaining strength, she takes her small umbrella to battle the storm on foot on the way to warn her husband in Nagasaki of the mortal threat still fresh in her mind of the atomic blast which she cannot forget.

Some critics made much of the fact that the film centered on the film's depiction of the atomic bombing as a war crime while omitting details of Japanese war crimes in the Pacific War. When Rhapsody premiered at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival, one journalist even cried out at a press conference, \\"Why was the bomb dropped in the first place?\\" At the Tokyo Film Festival, critics of Japanese militarism said Kurosawa had ignored the historical facts leading up to the bomb. Japanese cultural critic Inuhiko Yomota commented: \\"Many critics, myself included, thought Kurosawa chauvinistic in his portrayal of the Japanese as victims of the war, while ignoring the brutal actions of the Japanese and whitewashing them with cheap humanist sentiment.\\"Hibakusha Cinema:Intro Kurosawa's response was that wars are between governments, not people, and denied any anti-American agenda. Chicago Reader film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum praised the film as \\"a beautiful reminder from octogenarian Akira Kurosawa that he's still the master...The pastoral mood and performances of this film are both reminiscent of late John Ford, and Kurosawa's mise en scene and editing have seldom been more poetically apt.\\"  About the Japanese title  The Japanese title (八月の狂詩曲 Hachigatsu no rapusodī) is also known as Hachigatsu no kyōshikyoku.The Internet Movie Database \\"八月\\" means August, and \\"狂詩曲\\" means rhapsody. Both are Japanese kanji words. \\"狂詩曲\\" is usually pronounced \\"kyōshikyoku.\\" When this film released in Japan, 1991, Kurosawa added furigana \\"ラプソディー rapusodī\\" to the word \\"狂詩曲\\" contrary to the standard usage of Japanese.Shochiku official web site (Japanese) Akira Kurosawa, Masato Harada.

(Japanese) So the correct romanization of the official Japanese title is Hachigatsu no rapusodī. But, often, the Japanese title has been cited without the furigana in various media. This is the reason why the misreading Hachigatsu no kyōshikyoku has become more widely known than the correct pronunciation.

For the reducing agent, see sodium dithionite. Sodium dithionate Na2S2O6 is an important compound for inorganic chemistry. It is also known under names disodium dithionate, sodium hyposulfate, and sodium metabisulfate. The sulfur can be considered to be in its +5 oxidation state. It should not be confused with sodium dithionite, Na2S2O4, which is a very different compound, and is a powerful reducing agent with many uses in chemistry and biochemistry. Confusion between dithionate and dithionite is commonly encountered, even in manufacturers' catalogues. Preparation Sodium dithionate is produced by the oxidation of sodium bisulfite by manganese dioxide: :2 NaHSO3 \\\\+ MnO2 → Na2S2O6 \\\\+ MnO + H2O Alternatively, it can be prepared by the oxidation of sodium sulfite by the silver(I) cation: : + 2 Ag + SO → + 2 Ag Another method is via oxidation of sodium thiosulfate with chlorine: :3 Cl2 \\\\+ Na2S2O3·5H2O + 6 NaOH → Na2S2O6 \\\\+ 6 NaCl + 8 H2O And another method to produce sodium dithionate is treating sodium thiosulfate with sodium hypochlorite solution. Structure The dithionate ion represents sulfur that is oxidized relative to elemental sulfur, but not totally oxidized. Sulfur can be reduced to sulfide or totally oxidized to sulfate, with numerous intermediate oxidation states in inorganic moieties, as well as organosulfur compounds. Example inorganic ions include sulfite and thiosulfate. Sodium dithionate crystallize as orthorhombic crystals of the dihydrate (). The water of crystallization is lost when heated to 90 °C, and the structure becomes hexagonal. Large single crystals of () have been grown and studied for pulsed lasing purposes (pico second spectroscopy) with great success by E. Haussühl and cols. Properties Sodium dithionate is a very stable compound which is not oxidized by permanganate, dichromate or bromine. It can be oxidized to sulfate under strongly oxidizing conditions: these include boiling for one hour with 5 M sulfuric acid with an excess of potassium dichromate, or treating with an excess of hydrogen peroxide then boiling with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The Gibbs free energy change for the oxidation to sulfate is about −300 kJ/mol. In addition, the () anion is not a good reducing group. Therefore, it has been used to form single crystals of large cation complexes in high oxidation states without reduction of the metallic complex.

The entire series consists of thirteen episodes of twenty minutes each. It is shown on CBBC in the UK and ABC Kids in Australia. It first went on air in 2005. It was voted the best section of Dick and Dom in da Bungalow and Smile by viewers in two separate polls. It was created by Iain Lauchlan and Will Brenton, who also created and produced Tweenies, Boo!, Fun Song Factory and Jim Jam and Sunny. Original characters created by Mike Gordon at gordonillustration.com Plot The series centres on the life of twin children, a brother and sister, Lucy and Louie, and their fears about their new baby brother, Billy Bob. BB3B actually stands for Billy Bob Third Baby. The plot generally involves a circumstance where the twins suspect the brother as usual of being an extraterrestrial, and they go on a wild adventure trying to prove it and stop him from launching an invasion. The twins are babysat by Chubba, a teenage boy with a fondness for pizza. Chubba often goes along with the idea of an alien brother, sometimes very seriously, and at one point he cracks and tells the parents of the twins plans to build a time machine. The show is set in the fictional American city of Sunnyfield, which is shown as having a central urban area and outer suburban area, the latter being the home of the family portrayed. The twins' grandmother lives in a trailer in the house's front garden. Details Each episode begins with the local postman attempting to deliver a piece of mail to the family mailbox. This ends in him being disfigured or attacked somehow by some strange force within the box - for instance, being turned into a fish. He reappears sometimes later in the episode. The first time he appears is followed by the opening credits. The series is set in America, where, according to the plot, the father's mother moved from Rochdale, a town in Greater Manchester. The children's grandmother has affections for the man who lives across the street, Mr. Wienburger, and there is a running gag in that his face is never visible; the viewer seeing either just a silhouette or the back of his head. The Sprogs are baby-like creatures who emit green foul smelling gas. The series never features a real invasion, though it does go across the threshold of science fiction from reality when the postman appears during the episode and at the end the Sprogs always appear to be coming towards the Earth, however generally the theories of the twins are disproved. The song played by Bis is played again during the end credits rather than the opening theme. Characters Louie & Lucy Louie and Lucy are the two eldest children in the Jenkins family and are twins. The twins seem to be of around five or six years old and have a fascination with science fiction and fighting aliens. Throughout the show, the twins are seen playing games which to them they are fighting to defend Earth, but in fact are not and are really playing like a kid would. They make it their mission throughout the show to try to defeat the evil Sprog alien trying to take over Earth; the Sprog in question being their little brother. When not wearing a costume or going to bed, Lucy's clothes are a yellow shirt with some sort of science fiction planet with spikes coming out of it and short pink skirt. Louie wears a blue shirt with a picture of a planet with rings around it, and he wears blue jeans. They both have brown curly hair. Voiced by Teresa Gallagher and Colleen Daley. Billy Bob Billy Bob is the newly-born baby brother of Louie and Lucy. Billy Bob is a normal baby, but in Louie and Lucy's eyes they see him as a mind controlling Sprog alien whose means are to enslave earth. Billy Bob is simply known as The Sprog or BB3B to the kids, and is called Billy Bob mostly by their mum but she sometimes also calls him BB3B. Billy Bob is always seen wearing a striped green shirt and nappy. Jazz & Simon (parents) Jazz and Simon are the parents of Lucy, Louie and Billy Bob, and are often seen tired most of the time having to run around keeping track of the kids and keeping them out of trouble. Jazz does not appear to have a job but is very creative; she is said to be the glue that holds the family together. Simon is an architect whose plans never seem very practical nor work. The kids think that their parents are now zombies controlled by Billy Bob because of their slow mobility due to tiredness. Jazz wears a green long sleeve turtle neck and purple polka-dot skirt and Simon wears a striped red shirt with brown pants. Voiced by Regina Reagan and Gary Martin. Nana Nana is Simon's mum who lives in a trailer in the front yard of the Jenkins' house. As explained in the lyrics of the show's opening theme song, she moved from Rochdale, England to America. She makes a point of driving her Mini on the left of the road akin to the British. She is a relatively large woman who has an apparent love for Mr. Wienburger and has gone to extreme measures to get to him. She also has a western set of clothes and loves country music. Voiced by Colleen Daley. Mr. Wienburger Mr. Wienburger lives across the road from the Jenkins and is a mysterious man whose face we never see. He appears to have an important job, as most people seem to know him. He is afraid of Nana and constantly hides from her. Chubba Chubba is the teen babysitter of the Jenkins kids. He is a teenager of around 15 years old, and calls virtually everyone \\"Dude\\". His interests are science fiction shows/movies (anything on the television for that matter), eating pizza, watching old B movies, listening to punk music and hanging out with the kids. Chubba is a laid-back kind of person and goes strange after too long without TV. He gives the kids information on whatever they ask even if he has no clue. His real name is George, as mentioned in the episode when he gets a job at NASA. Voiced by Justin Fletcher. Bis The theme song of the series was performed by Scottish rock band Bis. Members Steven Clark (Sci-fi Steven), John Clark (John Disco), and Amanda MacKinnon (Manda Rin), along with their fictional drummer, appear at some point in all bar the first episode performing a song relating to the plot (which would be heard again during the closing credits). They turned up to sing in a variety of strange places during the series' run: the roof of a toy store; the back of a truck travelling along the street; the roof of the Jenkins' home; and even underwater in a large tank at the local aquarium. However, Bis played no part whatsoever in the storylines; they never interacted with the show's characters, and the characters never seemed to see and/or hear them either. Bis was also best known for writing, composing and performing the ending theme song to The Powerpuff Girls.

Grunsky's musical career has spanned two continents. More than three decades of recording and touring have earned him a wide following from both adult and children's audiences. Folk music Born in Austria, he came to Canada as an infant. His singing and performing began in high school in Toronto, but after graduating he returned to Europe where his music career began. In 1966 he formed the successful but short-lived folk singing group, Jack's Angels who were signed to Amadeo Records of Vienna, Austria. After the group disbanded, Grunsky recorded three solo albums for the label, one of which was produced by Alexis Korner. The album, Toronto, was recorded in London and featured tracks with Mick Taylor on slide guitar. He was subsequently brought on board the progressive German label, Kuckuck Records of Munich, where he produced three more albums of original material.These have recently been reissued in CD box sets by Kuckuck Records. Grunsky was a featured guest on many radio and TV specials and even hosted his own half-hour weekly radio show called, Folk With Jack an Austrian radio ORF. In 1974 he moved with wife and young daughter back to Canada where he connected with record producer Chad Irschick and released an independent album titled, The Patience Of A Sailor. Children's music In the early 1980s Grunsky developed a keen interest in music for children. Since then, he has been well known for his children's music. His eleven recordings for children have received prestigious awards in children's media including two Juno Awards for Best Children's Recording, several U.S. Parents' Choice Gold Awards, multiple placements on the American Library Association's \\"Notable Recording Lists\\" and a Parent's Guide to Children's Media Award. He tours extensively, performing in theatres and family concert settings, international children's festivals, and Early Childhood Educational conferences. Numerous television appearances on Treehouse TV have broadened his appeal both in Canada and the United States. Grunsky has also performed his symphony show for young audiences called Welcome to the Orchestra with most major Canadian orchestras. Other music production credits include Fred Penner's 2002 CD, Sing With Fred, which won Children's Album of the Year at the 2003 Juno Awards. Jack Grunsky released his first NuJazz instrumental CD, Coastlines, in 2006. He released a follow-up album, Room To Move in May 2008. He continues to focus on both jazz and children's performances. His most recent children's album, Hoppin' Socks was released in 2011. His daughter Cosima is a singer-songwriter who often performs music with her father.

He was the son of Arnold Haskell, an influential ballet critic and writer. He read history at King's College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he was a member of the semi-secretive Cambridge Apostles society, a debating club largely reserved for the brightest students. Academic career In 1954, Haskell was elected a fellow of the King's College, Cambridge. Later he was Professor of Art History at Oxford from 1967 until his retirement in 1995; the position made him, ex officio a Visitor—that is, a trustee—of the Ashmolean Museum. He was a trustee of the Wallace Collection, 1976–1997. In 1976 Haskell, who often served on advisory committees for museum loan exhibitions, joined the National Art Collections Fund committee and became one of its most vocal members, defending the purchase of Poussin's Rebecca and Eliezar for the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge (the government refused to accept the painting because it had been in the collection of the disgraced Anthony Blunt). His interest in the circumstances in which paintings were displayed, which reflected the esteem in which they were held and influenced the way they were perceived runs as a leitmotiv through his published work, beginning with an article jointly written with Michael Levey in Arte Veneta, 1958, that was devoted to art exhibitions in eighteenth-century Venice.Noted by Nicholas Penny in his introduction to The Ephemeral Museum. Personal life His wife, Larissa, had been a curator at the Hermitage Museum.

Some authors prefer the synonym Orthosia stabilis (Denis & Schiffermüller, 1775). It is distributed throughout Europe and is also found in Turkey, Israel, Transcaucasia, Russia and eastern Siberia. This is a variable species, the ground colour of the forewings ranging from greyish to orangey brown, sometimes with a broad dark band. The most distinctive features are two large stigmata, each edged by a narrow pale line, with a similarly coloured subterminal line. The hindwings are drab grey or brown. Technical description and variation The wingspan is 34–40 mm. Forewing reddish grey, more or less dusted with dark: inner and outer lines blackish, indistinct; orbicular and reniform stigmata ringed with ochreous; submarginal line ochreous preceded by a fuscous or rufous shade; claviform mostly unmarked; veins towards termen pale: hindwing grey, the fringe paler. The species varies according to the amount of red present; — ab. pallida Tutt is pale grey, sometimes with an ochreous flush; — obliqua Vill. is darker grey with markings clearer; — suffusa Tutt is an equally well marked blackish-grey form; of these grey forms the second only obliqua Vill. is common; on the other hand when the red tints predominate we get the form rufa Tutt, which is also rare; - in junctus Haw. the upper stigmata, usually separate, are coherent; this accidental connection occurs in all the forms occasionally: — in ab. rufannulata Haw. the stigmata are edged with, and the submarginal line is coloured rufous instead of ochreous.Seitz, A.

The above two-rail JB-2 launch ramp at Holloman was a on a 3° earth- filled slope—a second ramp was on a trailer (1948–9 missile detection experiments used modified SCR-270 radar at Holloman.) The Air Force Missile Development Center and its predecessors were Cold War units that conducted and supported numerous missile tests using facilities at Holloman Air Force Base, where the center was the host unit (\\"Holloman\\" and \\"Development Center\\" were sometimes colloquially used to identify military installations in the Tularosa Basin.) Background Planned for British Overseas Training which was not pursued, World War II construction for a Tularosa Basin USAAF base west of Alamogordo, New Mexico, began on 6 February 1942. A nearby military range was established by Executive Order No. 9029, and the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range was designated on 14 May 1942. On 27 May 1942 the USAAF base was designated Alamogordo Field Training Station for range support and was subsequently named Alamogordo Army Air Base. 359th Base Headquarters The 359th Base Headquarters was the base operating unit for Alamorgordo AAB beginning on 10 June 1942, and the base was redesignated Alamogordo Army Air Field on 21 November 1942 and supported numerous WWII Bomber Groups (range targets were added in late 1942.) In October 1944 at Wendover Army Air Base, Utah, the Special Weapons Field Test Unit was established as a detachment of the Special Weapons Branch in Ohio to evaluate captured and experimental systems such as the Republic‐Ford JB‐2, a copy of the German V-1 flying bomb. South of Alamogordo AAF between White Sands National Monument and Fort Bliss, water well drilling began construction of White Sands Proving Ground (WSPG) facilities on 25 June 1945. On 25 March 1944, the 231st AAF BU became the base operating unit, and in 1946 the post-war Alamogordo AAF was \\"manned by a skeleton crew merely as a plane refueling station, [for] emergency landings, etc\\" (the USACE property division \\"acquired...exclusive use of all private lands and interests within the Alamogordo Bombing Range until 1967\\".) In March 1947, the 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group of Florida began Republic- Ford JB-2 testing at the Alamogordo range, and the Special Weapons Field Test Unit was inactivated when Wendover transferred to Strategic Air Command.AFHRA Document 00179518, Pictorial Brochure of the Special Weapons Field Test Unit, Wendover Army Air Base, Utah Equipment and 1,200 personnel of the Test Unit moved to a new Alamogordo AAF unit organized 16 March 1947 (4145th Army Air Forces Base Unit), and the move continued until September 1947 for R&D; of pilotless aircraft, guided missiles, and other programs. The Balloon Branch at Alamogordo AAF began in 1947 after an Air Materiel Command awarded a contract to New York University (NYU) to develop and fly high-altitude balloons. The 4145th was redesignated an Air Force Base Unit on 27 September 1947 during the month the USAF was created, and in late 1947Integration of the Holloman-White Sands Ranges, 1947–1952 (2nd Edition, 1957) the former USAAF bombing range and the White Sands Proving Ground merged to become the New Mexico Joint Guided Missile Test Range. The former USAAF air base was designated Holloman Air Force Base on 14 January 1948, and the 2754th Air Force Base was its host unit after being established from the 4145th AFBU on 15 August 1948 (the 2754th AFB unit's \\"Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron\\" were established by 15 December 1948). Alamogordo Guided Missile Test Base The Alamogordo Guided Missile Test Base near Holloman AFB continued to be used for testing in 1948 and later (July 1951 – August 31, 1952), sub-base of the AFMTC in Florida, and the 2754th subsequently developed additional launch support sites at/near the former bombing range (e.g., Four Bits Peak Instrumentation Annex assigned June 1949 \\"7 mi ESE of Alamogordo, NM\\").

He obtained his Ph.D. on normal numbers from University of California, Berkeley in 1949, where his adviser was Derrick Henry Lehmer. His better known papers include the first modern analysis of Fibonacci sequence modulo a positive integer. Drawing on Wall's work, Zhi-Hong Sun and his twin brother Zhi-Wei Sun proved a theorem about what are now known as the Wall–Sun–Sun primes that guided the search for counterexamples to Fermat's last theorem. Early life Wall was born in Kansas City, Missouri on August 13, 1921 to Donald F. Wall and Mary Wooldridge. The family lived in Louisiana and Texas as he was growing up. In 1933, they moved to Whittier, California, then in 1936 to Santa Barbara, California, where he graduated from high school in 1938. He enrolled at UCLA and joined the Delta Sigma Phi fraternity. In April 1940 he had a successful operation to remove a brain tumor at UC Hospital in San Francisco. The surgeon was Howard C. Naffziger, who later served on the board of Regents of the University of California. He and Naffziger kept in touch for many years afterwards. Career He graduated from UCLA with a B.A. in Mathematics in the spring of 1944. After graduation he took a full-time job with Douglas Aircraft but continued in graduate school at UCLA. In 1946 he received an M.A. in mathematical statistics from UCLA. In the same year he passed the first three of eight actuarial exams. In 1947, he moved to Hartford, Connecticut to work for the Aetna Life Insurance Company. He also taught an evening math class at Trinity College. In the fall of 1947, he returned to graduate school at Harvard University, where he became interested in number theory. He also took a class at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In June 1948 he returned to California to complete his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley, where he also taught classes as a teaching assistant. In 1949 he was awarded his Ph.D. in normal numbers from UC Berkeley. In fall of 1949 he and his family moved to Santa Barbara where he took a job as instructor in mathematics at Santa Barbara College of the University of California. He taught general astronomy as well as number theory and other math courses. After two years, he was promoted to assistant professor. In 1950, he taught a course in computer mathematics at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, where computers were being developed for calculating missile trajectories. From his work at Pt Mugu, he was recruited by IBM to work as an Applied Science Representative starting July 1951 in Los Angeles. In 1956, he became IBM's Education Coordinator for the west coast. He traveled to interested universities in the western US to give them details of a program developed by the UCLA Anderson School of Management about the use of computers in business. In 1958, he moved to White Plains, New York and continued working at IBM until his retirement in 1982.

It was one of the original area codes created in 1947, at which time it served the entire state. In 1954, area code 402 was split. Eastern Nebraska retained 402, and area code 308 was assigned to western Nebraska. The overall roughly diagonal dividing line runs from the southeast between Hastings and Minden north into the northern part of the state and then west towards the eastern edge of the Sandhills in the northwest of the state. History Nebraska's most-populous cities, Omaha and Lincoln, are near each other in the eastern part of the state. In comparable circumstances in Kansas, where its most-populous cities, Wichita, Topeka, and Kansas City are in that state's eastern part, a north- south split was implemented placing Wichita in one area code, with Topeka and Kansas City in another. However, in Nebraska an east-west split was implemented in which Omaha and Lincoln retained 402, while Grand Island, then the state's third-most-populous city, was placed in 308. Omaha and Lincoln are not only home to most of Nebraska's landlines, but also to most of its cell phones and pagers. As a result, area code 402 was nearly exhausted by the end of the 1990s. It was originally projected to be exhausted in 2001, but number pooling was implemented to stave off exhaustion. In 2009, however, NeuStar projected that 402 would be exhausted in 2010. In March 2011, area code 531 was implemented in an overlay plan to area code 402. Although the first central office prefix in 531 was not assigned until February 2013, ten-digit dialing has been mandatory for all calls from the 402 territory since spring 2011.

Heroic resistance of Polish forces became a symbol, and was glorified and immortalised in the paintings of Franciszek Smuglewicz, Józef Peszka and Aleksander Lesser.  History  The castle in Trembowla was built in the 14th century on a high hill over the valley of the Hniezna river. Despite its small size (100 metres by 40 metres), it was a strong fortress with walls up to 4 metres thick. After the Turks had captured Kamieniec Podolski (see Siege of Kamieniec Podolski), Trembowla was one of the few Podolian strongholds still in Polish hands. In the summer of 1675, a 30,000 strong Turkish-Tatar army under command of Ibrahim Shyshman entered Red Ruthenia, a province of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. On July 27, the invaders captured Zbaraz, on September 11, Podhajce, and on September 20, the Turks approached Trembowla. The castle was defended by a small unit of 80 infantry soldiers, some members of the local nobility, supported by 200 poorly armed, untrained peasants and residents of the town, who fled to the castle. Before the siege, a unit of dragoons stationed here, but was ordered to leave Trembowla, due to food shortages. Polish forces were commanded by Captain Jan Samuel Chrzanowski, whose wife, Anna Dorota Chrzanowska (née Anna Dorota von Fresen), became immortalized after the siege. Despite Turkish efforts, the defenders of castle managed to hold their positions after several attacks. After several days, however, shortages of food and water became severe, and Captain Chrzanowski decided to surrender. His wife disagreed with this decision, and threatened to commit suicide if her husband proceeded with the planned surrender, thereby stiffening his spine and creating an atmosphere for defending the castle. Furthermore, Anna Dorota urged the defenders to carry out an attack on Turkish positions, which resulted in heavy losses among the invaders. Chrzanowska’s determination raised the morale among the Poles, but their losses were also heavy. In the night of October 4/5, only 20 soldiers were able to fight. Facing danger from forces of Jan III Sobieski, which concentrated near Lwow, the Turks decided to end the siege on October 11.  Aftermath  In 1676 Polish Sejm allowed the Chrzanowski couple to become the szlachta, with the right to use the Poraj coat of arms. They became celebrities, famous all over the Commonwealth and abroad. In 1683 Chrzanowski was named stolnik of Smolensk and Mielnik, and a monument of Anna Dorota Chrzanowska was erected in Trembowla in 1683.  Siege of Trembowla in Culture  The siege of Trembowla and story of Anna Chrzanowska inspired Polish painters and writers alike.

In the 2001 Census the village had a population of 1,223,Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Rotherham Retrieved 28 August 2009 increasing to 1,478 at the 2011 Census. The civil parish includes the village of Harley on the B6090 road to the west of the main settlement.  History  The village's history is dominated by the Wentworth, Watson-Wentworth and Wentworth-Fitzwilliam families who lived in Wentworth Woodhouse. They also owned perhaps most of the land in the village. Wentworth gained some independence when the Fitzwilliam family line ended in 1979. The village dates back to at least 1066, when, according to the Domesday book, Rynold Wynterwade was lord of the manor. About 1250 Robert Wentworth married Emma Woodhouse, beginning the Wentworth- Woodhouse line; the family lived in the area for over 450 years. The lands then passed to the Watson family when William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford died without heir; the Watsons held the land until 1782. During this time most of the local follies were built. The Fitzwilliam ownership ended in 1979 when Thomas Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 10th Earl Fitzwilliam died. The Old Holy Trinity Church, the village's first church was a chapel of ease to All Saints Church, Wath Upon Dearne. Like its successor it was the principal place of worship on the estate, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, and is thought to date to the 12th century. James Nasmyth, the developer of the steam hammer, and his bride Anne Hartop were married there on 16 June 1840. The new church, Holy Trinity Parish Church, was commissioned in 1872 by the 6th Earl Fitzwilliam to the design of John Loughborough Pearson, an exponent of the Gothic Revival style, and was consecrated in 1877 by the Archbishop of York. In September 1999 Wentworth Brewery was established at the old power station on the Wentworth estate. The Brewery ceased trading at the beginning of June 2016. Landmarks The village has cottages and houses of architectural and historic interest. The site of the village stocks in Main Street is now occupied by a telephone kiosk; opposite is the base of the village cross. The oldest known cottage, Ivy Cottage (a cruck cottage off Main Street), is attached to Snowdrop Farm. The major landmark is the country house Wentworth Woodhouse. In the grounds of the house are 21 follies, including the Needle's Eye, Hoober Stand, Keppel's Column, the Rockingham Mausoleum, the Ionic Temple and Doric Temple, the Vinegar Stone, and the Bean Seat. Close to Hoober Stand is the Hoober Observatory of the Mexborough & Swinton Astronomical Society.

History The Evening Telegram was first published on April 3, 1879 by William James Herder. It adopted its current name in 1998, although it was also briefly published under this name in 1881. Herder and his descendants owned and published The Evening Telegram until it was sold to Thomson Newspapers (now Thomson Corporation) in 1970, and continued as publishers until the departure of Stephen R. Herder (William's Grandson) in 1991. William Herder began as a printer for the St. John's weekly The Courier. When it folded in 1878, Herder purchased one of the presses and began his own newspaper. The Telegram was notable as the first daily (excluding Sundays) in Newfoundland. It is also the only 19th century Newfoundland newspaper to survive into the 20th (and now 21st) century. Over the course of its history, the paper has published news, stories and editorials of interest to readers in the Dominion/Province of Newfoundland and St. John's in particular. Coverage of the St. John's Great Fire of 1892 was hampered as the Evening Telegram head office on Duckworth Street was completely destroyed in the fire. Despite heavy losses, Herder rebuilt and was published from a temporary location on Water Street less than two months later. On April 13, 2017, Transcontinental announced that it had sold all of its newspapers in Atlantic Canada to SaltWire Network, a newly formed parent company of The Chronicle Herald. Politics In the 19th century, The Evening Telegram was known for its strong opinions on issues of the day, including the Newfoundland Railway, and early Confederation discussions. However, its editorial policy remained neutral during the heated Confederation debates of 1948/49. The same could not be said of former Evening Telegram reporter Joey Smallwood, who worked for the paper from 1919 to 1922 (including a short stint as editor in 1923). After his association with The Evening Telegram, Smallwood went on to found the pro- Confederation newspaper The Confederate, lead Newfoundland into confederation with Canada, and become the first premier of the new Province of Newfoundland. As Premier, Smallwood had a rocky relationship with The Telegram, bringing a series of libel suits against it and threatening to withdraw all government advertising. The paper has not explicitly endorsed candidates during recent general elections. It does not shy away from political criticism, however, and in recent years has been quite critical at various times of both the federal Conservatives under Stephen Harper,For example: Mr. Harper, the facts do matter, April 14, 2007, and Closing the barn door, October 10, 2008 and to a lesser extent the provincial Conservatives under Danny Williams.For example: Burke's blunder, July 31, 2008 At the same time, it has not expressed any particular confidence in opposing parties such as the Liberals.For example: Don't bank on Dion's promise, April 24, 2007 Community ties and current status Well-known former Telegram journalists include Newfoundland writers Harold Horwood, Ray Guy,Porter, Stephanie. \\"Basically, He's Still Around - William J.

Other notable contributors to The Telegram include former editor and author Michael Harrington, artist Rae Perlin, former Newfoundland Prime Minister William F. Lloyd and former provincial NDP leader Peter Fenwick. The Telegram is the original publication venue of the monthly church history column by Dr Hans Rollmann.Index of Hans Rollmann's columns. The Telegram has sponsored the Tely 10 10 mile road race annually since 1927, and the provincial men's senior hockey trophy, the Herder Cup, is named for William Herder.

Ernst Hermann Ludimar Meyer (8 December 1905 – 8 October 1988) was a German composer and musicologist. His works include numerous songs, as well as chamber music, two symphonies and other works for orchestra, an opera, and an oratorio. He wrote numerous musicological articles as well as a book on English chamber music. His pupils included Serge Hovey. As a musicologist, he edited numerous manuscripts by English composers of the Tudor and Renaissance periods (for example, Englische Fantasien aus dem 17. Jahrhundert : für drei Streichinstrumente = English fantasias from the 17th century : for three string instruments ).  Life  Meyer was born in Berlin. He received his first piano lessons at the age of six, and started composing at eleven. After finishing school, he worked as an apprentice at a bank, and in 1926 he started the advanced study for music at Heidelberg University, where in 1930 he completed his Ph.D. on the 17th century chamber music of North German composers. He became a pupil of Hanns Eisler. Being a Jew, he emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1933 to avoid detention by the Nazi Party; there he eventually became a close friend of leftist composer Alan Bush. In the UK, he researched English chamber music of the 17th century and lectured for the Workers Educational Association. In 1939 he began lecturing at Bedford College, London; in 1945 he was given a guest professorship at King's College, Cambridge. Meyer returned to East Germany (GDR) in 1948 and became one of the most influential figures of music culture there. He was active politically as a communist, and his works include choral, orchestral, and chamber music written to display commitment to Marxist–Leninist ideals. In 1982 the second edition of his book Early English Chamber Music was published. Meyer was head of the German Society of Composers and Musicologists, professor of musicology at Berlin's Humboldt University, chairman of the German Handel Society, and founder of the annual Handel Festival, which is still celebrated in Halle, Germany.

Designed by Augustus Welby Pugin and substantially complete by 1841, St Chad's is one of the first four Catholic churches that were constructed after the English Reformation and raised to cathedral status in 1852.Decree of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, 21 April 1852. The other churches raised to cathedrals by this decree were St George's, Southwark, St Barnabas, Nottingham and St John's, Salford: Decreta Quatuor Conciliorum Provincialium Westmonasteriensium, (2nd Edn, London: Burns & Oates), p.56; translation in: Robert Guy OSB, The Synods in English (Stratford-on-Avon: St Gregory Press, 1886) p.101. It is one of only four minor basilicas in England (the others being Downside Abbey, the National Shrine of Our Lady at Walsingham and Corpus Christi Priory, this last now disused). St Chad's is a Grade II* listed building. The cathedral is located in a public greenspace near St Chad's Queensway, in central Birmingham. The current Archbishop is Bernard Longley and the Dean is Monsignor Timothy Menezes. History St Chad's was one of the first Catholic cathedral erected in England after the English Reformation initiated in 1534 by King Henry VIII. St Chad's Cathedral was built at the behest of Bishop Thomas Walsh, the local apostolic vicar (styled Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District). St Chad's Cathedral was designed by Augustus Welby Pugin, the foundation stone was laid in October 1839 and the building consecrated as a church on 21 June 1841. The project received generous donations from John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury, who was the last Catholic Earl of Shrewsbury. The church was raised to the status of cathedral in 1852 following the restoration of the Catholic Hierarchy in England by Pope Pius IX in 1850. The first Bishop of Birmingham was William Bernard Ullathorne OSB, whose monument is the Crypt of the Cathedral. He was buried at St Dominic's Priory, Stone, a convent of Dominican sisters. In 1911 the diocese was elevated to an archdiocese. The cathedral was situated in the Gunmakers Quarter of Birmingham, which endangered it during the Second World War. It was bombed on 22 November 1940. An incendiary bomb fell through the roof of the south aisle and bounced from the floor into some central heating pipes, which then burst. The water from the damaged central heating pipes thus extinguished the fire. A thanksgiving tablet appears in the diapered design of the transept ceiling, reading 22 Nov 1940 ('Thanks be to God'). In 1941 St Chad's was declared a Minor Basilica by Pope Pius XII as a church of important historical connections: only one of two such in England. On formal occasions, the ', a golden lattice bell tower and ', which is a small red and gold striped umbrella, are displayed at the altar steps as the official symbols of a basilica. The last Archbishop was Vincent Nichols, who served from 2000–09, and then became Archbishop of Westminster. the Archdiocese of Birmingham was led by Bernard Longley, titular bishop of Zanda, who was named as the Archbishop on 1 October 2009, and was installed in his cathedral by Bishop David McGough (Auxiliary Bishop of Birmingham incharge of the North Staffordshire region of the Archdiocese), and presented with his crozier by his predecessor Archbishop Nichols on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, 8 December 2009. St Chad's was the venue for Midnight Mass, broadcast by BBC One at Christmas 2016. Patronal saint The patron of the cathedral is St Chad, a 7th-century Bishop of Mercia and pupil of St Aidan of Lindisfarne. The cathedral enshrines, in the canopy above the altar, the relics of some long bones of St Chad. These were originally enshrined at, and rescued from, Lichfield Cathedral by Prebendary Arthur Dudley, before its despoliation during the Reformation, in about 1538. Fr Dudley passed the bones to his nieces, Bridget and Katherine Dudley of Russell's Hall, whence they were divided in parcels and passed down among their family. In 1651, Henry Hodgetts, a farmer, of Sedgley was dying and his wife summoned an itinerant priest, Fr Peter Turner, SJ to give him the last sacraments. When they recited the litany of the saints, Henry kept calling upon Saint Chad, pray for me. On being asked why he called upon St Chad, he replied, \\"because his bones are in the head of my bed\\". He then instructed his wife to pass the box of relics to Fr Turner for safekeeping and he took them back to the Seminary of St Omer, in Northern France, where he was based.\\"The Relics of St. Chad\\", St. Chad's Cathedral In the 19th century, the relics found their way into the hands of Sir Thomas Fizherbert-Brockholes of Aston Hall, near Stafford. After Sir Thomas's death, his widow moved to Swynnerton Hall and their chaplain, Fr Benjamin Hulme found the dusty velvet-covered box of relics under the altar, when he cleared out the chapel. Fr Hulme presented the relics to Bishop Walsh. So it was that the relics of the saint who was the apostle of the Midlands in the 7th century were enshrined above the altar. These relics were subjected to carbon dating analysis by the archaeological laboratory of Oxford University in 1985, on the order of Archbishop Couve de Murville, which showed all but one of the bones to date from the 7th century, which concurs with the death of St Chad on 2 March 672 AD. Architecture and fittings The west front the nave The architect chosen to design St Chad's, Augustus Welby Pugin (1812–52), later became one of England's most renowned Gothic Revival architects. Pugin had converted to Roman Catholicism in 1835, and spent most of the remainder of his working life designing Catholic churches, their fittings and vestments. St Chad's was the first large church that he designed which was planned, from the outset in 1837, to become a cathedral. Pugin lavished much care on the building, and described, in his letters, not only the architecture, but its decoration, fittings and furnishings. The Clerk of Works and builder of St Chad's was George Myers. St Chad's replaced a smaller church dedicated to St Austin, built on the same site in 1808, in the Gunmakers' Quarter of the town on steeply sloping land that fell away to the canal and wharf.Tim Tatton-Brown and John Crook, The English Cathedral (p.108) Because of the narrow site, and the necessity to build in brick rather than stone, Pugin was restricted in the style and proportions of the church that he could design. Because he wished to make the church as open and spacious as possible, he looked as a model to the style of churches that were built in Northern Germany in the late Middle Ages.Phoebe Stanton, Pugin (pp 557–66) St Chad's is built in the style of a brick hall church or \\"hallenkirke\\", similar to Munich Cathedral and has a westwerk with narrow broached spires similar to those of Lübeck Cathedral. Because of the steep slope of the site, Pugin built a large crypt beneath the building, to be used primarily as a burial place for family tombs, and former cathedral clergy, and is now rehearsal room for the choir. The geographical alignment is unusual in that the \\"east end\\" (the location of the altar) actually faces approximately north west. The interior, the nave of which is almost twice as high as it is wide, has a very high arcade, like German hall churches, carried on clusters of thin shafts, those of the chancel being decorated in paint and gold leaf with a helical pattern like a barber's pole, bearing the legend Sanctus Sanctus Sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth ('Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts'). The wooden ceiling, with curving blue trusses, is ornamented with monograms and floral patterns, inspired by the remnants of medieval decoration to be found on the ancient ceilings of Ely and Peterborough Cathedrals. Phoebe Stanton describes the ornate decoration of the ceiling as \\"brilliant\\" and so delicate that \\"it resembles fabric stretched over a lattice\\". Pugin designed many of the fittings including the high altar under an elaborate baldachin, with riddel posts, and the choir screen. The Bishop's Chair, in oak upholstered in green velvet, backed with the diocesan shield of arms was also designed by Pugin. Other fittings, such the 16th century carved pulpit and the medieval canons' stalls were from churches in Belgium and Germany respectively and were collected and donated by John Talbot, the 16th Earl of Shrewsbury. The sanctuary windows are the work of William Warrington. Other windows, metalwork, fittings and vestments were provided by John Hardman of Birmingham, to the design or specifications of Pugin. Hardman was a parishioner of St Chad's, founding the Cathedral Choir in 1854. Four generations of his family are among those interred in the crypt.St Chad's Cathedral Website In 1932 St. Chad's was extended by the addition of St Edward's Chapel, designed by Pugin's grandson, Sebastian Pugin Powell, and built in memory of Archbishop Edward Ilsley and his patron St. Edward the Confessor. The chapel windows depict the history of the relics of St. Chad, and those who have served the church there, along with some magnificent ecclesiastical coats of arms. In the 1960s a number of the fittings, including Pugin's screen, were removed and the interior repainted, to the detriment of the original design. The rood screen was rescued by an Anglican priest, who had it re-erected in the Anglican Holy Trinity Church, Reading. Other artefacts were removed to other churches, including the giant rood crucifix, which after its removal to the Church of the Sacred Heart & St Therese, in Coleshill, was reinstated in the cathedral within the Sanctuary on the instructions of Archbishop Maurice Couve de Murville. The Cathedral as it appears today is a result of post-Vatican II renovations and re-orderings, with only some of Pugin's work surviving. The original chancel arrangement was altered, again much to the detriment of its design, destroying Pugin's intent. Its appearance today is a mere shadow of how it was originally conceived by Pugin, but its enduring beauty in the face of iconoclasm is testament to the skill of its original designers. St Barnabas Cathedral in Nottingham, also by Pugin, suffered similarly, with much of the original decoration smothered with whitewash, and fittings destroyed. The former Bishop's House, which stood nearby and was also by Pugin, was demolished in 1959 due to Road widening. MusicOrgan= The organ The cathedral has a three manual organ by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd, built in 1993. It is sited at the west end of the cathedral in a magnificent case designed by David Graebe. The consultant was Nicolas Kynaston and the instrument is considered to be one of the finest mechanical organs in the country. There is a regular programme of recitals throughout the year and the organ is also used as a teaching instrument for students and staff of Birmingham Conservatoire. The current Organist and Director of Music is Professor David Saint BA, BMus, FRCO FRSCM FBC FISM FRSA (former Principal of Birmingham Conservatoire) and the Assistant Director of Music is Nigel Morris MA. The current Organ Scholar is Dylan McCaig. Directors of Music * 1848 – ?

Hardman was for many years cantor of the choir, and is commemorated by a small white figure of him in the lower left- hand corner of a stained glass window of 1868 located in the north aisle and depicting the Immaculate Conception, with a line of plainchant along the bottom, being the Introit for the feast of the Immaculate Conception. Currently, the four-part, robed choir comprises around adult men and women who lead the worship at the Sunday Solemn Mass (at 11:00 am). They also lead the worship during Holy Week and Easter, when the Archbishop presides. The choir specialises in the Latin polyphonic music of the renaissance, but sings a wide repertory of Masses and motets in English and Latin. The choir sings occasional concerts and has featured in television and radio broadcasts. =Bells= In 1840 St Chad's was presented with a single bell weighing approximately . In 1848 the metal from this bell was used in the casting of a ring of five bells, made by Mears of Whitechapel and hung in the north-west tower. They were augmented by three bells by Blews of Birmingham in 1877. The eight bells were first rung on Easter Sunday of that year. In 1940 the bells were recast by Taylors of Loughborough. The eight bells form a diatonic octave in the key of F Major, with the heaviest bell (the tenor) weighing . They are hung for full-circle ringing in the north-west tower, and are rung regularly on Sunday morning after High Mass, at about 12 noon, and at other major services by the St Chad's Cathedral Society of Change Ringers. Location The cathedral is in a green public space near Birmingham Snow Hill railway station and is located on what is now called St Chad's Queensway after the cathedral, at the junction with Snow Hill Queensway and Old Snow Hill (becomes Constitution Hill), part of the Birmingham Inner Ring Road constructed in the 1970s. St Chad's is on the northern side of the road, which divides the cathedral from the city centre.

Variety was known for its playful use of Broadway and Hollywood jargon to pack as much meaning as possible into a small headline or article; examples include \\"H'wood\\" and \\"biz\\". Using a form of headlinese that the newspaper called \\"slanguage\\", \\"Sticks Nix Hick Pix\\" means that people in rural areas (\\"the sticks\\") reject (\\"nix\\") motion pictures (\\"pix\\") about rural people (\\"hicks\\"). The accompanying article is based on an interview with Joe Kinsky, who operated theaters in the mostly rural Tri-State circuit of Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska. Kinsky claims that \\"Farmers are not interested in farming pictures\\", and that two recent pictures set in an upper-class milieu, The Barretts of Wimpole Street and The Scarlet Pimpernel, had been big successes with his demographic. According to Spanish writer and journalist Peter Besas (author of the 2000 book Inside \\"Variety\\": The Story of the Bible of Show Business, 1905-1987), the headline was written by Variety editor-in-chief Abel Green. Because it was the lead headline of the paper, it was printed in all capital letters. Standard style for other Variety headlines was initial capital letters on almost all words.  Mentions and similar headlines \\"STICKS NIX HICK PIX\\" is a frequently-cited headline, although references often get it slightly wrong. It is used as an example of space constraint-driven \\"headlinese\\" in Garner's Modern American Usage. Similar headlines have appeared in publications such as the Chicago Tribune (\\"HIX PIX CLIX\\", 1988), the New York Times (\\"Hicks Nix Blix Fix\\", 2002; \\"Hicks Nix Climate Fix\\", 2013), and the New York Daily News (\\"HICKS NIX KNICKS TIX\\", 2000). As well, references and variations have appeared in various media. David Burdett titled his 1984 novel Hix Nix Stix Pix. The 1942 movie Yankee Doodle Dandy features a scene where George M. Cohan (played by James Cagney) explains the headline to some students, leading to an impromptu dance.  Parodies  The Simpsons episode \\"Colonel Homer\\" shows \\"Hix in Stix Love Chix Lix\\" as a headline on the Springfield Variety, while the Futurama episode \\"That's Lobstertainment!\\" shows a Daily Variety headline \\"Fox Exex Bax Sex Pix, Flix Lax Crux Bux, Stox Sinx, Ax Prex\\". Other references have included Animaniacs (\\"Hix Makes Pix but the Flick Needs Fix\\" in the song \\"Variety Speak\\"; \\"Nix Pix Shplix Queen\\" in The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! as a Variety headline after Frank's incident with Queen Elizabeth II; \\"Crix Pix Crucifix Schticks\\" quoted by Monsignor O'Hara in the musical Sister Act; \\"Sick Pic Nixes Brit Crit\\" as a fictional Variety headline in Jonathan Coe's 1997 novel The House of Sleep.

Rajiforms are distinguished by the presence of greatly enlarged pectoral fins, which reach as far forward as the sides of the head, with a generally flattened body. The undulatory pectoral fin motion diagnostic to this taxon is known as rajiform locomotion. The eyes and spiracles are located on the upper surface of the head and the gill slits are on the underside of the body. Most species give birth to live young, although some lay eggs enclosed in a horny capsule (\\"mermaid's purse\\"). Characteristics Rajoids typically have a dorsoventrally flattened body. The snout is slender and pointed and the wide mouth, often covered with a fleshy nasal flap, is on the underside of the head. The eyes and well- developed spiracles are located on the top of the head. In most species, the spiracles are large and are the main means of drawing water in for respiration. There is no nictitating membrane and the cornea is continuous with the skin surrounding the eyes. The gill slits are on the ventral surface just behind the head and there are five in all species except the sixgill stingray (Hexatrygon bickelli). The front few vertebrae are fused into a synarcual and this either articulates with the bones of the well-developed pectoral girdle or is fused to them, the suprascapulae uniting above the vertebral column. Most species have enlarged, thorn-like dermal denticles on their skin, often with a row of large denticles along the spine. The pectoral fins are large, but not clearly demarcated from the body, and together with the body are known as the disc. They start from the side of the head in front of the gill openings and end at the caudal peduncle. There are up to two dorsal fins but no anal fin. A slender tail is clearly demarcated from the disc. The caudal fin varies in size between species and the rays have a whip- like tail with no caudal fin. Distribution Species of the order Rajiformes are found throughout the world's oceans, from Arctic to Antarctic waters, and from shallow coastal shelves to open seas and abyssal regions. A few are found in rivers and some in estuaries, but most are marine, living near the sea bed at depths down to or more. Diversity Families = Four extant and two extinct families of rajoid are currently recognized: * Anacanthobatidae * Arhynchobatidae * Gurgesiellidae * Rajidae * †Sclerorhynchidae * †Ptychotrygonidae * Clade containing †Ischyrhiza, †Schizorhiza, and †Onchopristis Formerly, some Rhinopristiforms were also included. The smooth skates, the Anacanthobatidae, contain a single genus, Anacanthobatis, of about 10 species. They are small fish living on the continental slopes of tropical and subtropical waters, and are native to Natal, South Africa, tropical West Africa, and Taiwan. Smooth skates have a filament extending from a rounded protuberance on the snout. Both the dorsal and ventral surfaces are smooth and have no dermal denticles. The tail is slender and a little shorter than the body. No dorsal fins are present and the caudal fin is small and membranous. Raja texana, the roundel skate The skate family Rajidae contains 14 genera and around 200 species. They are found worldwide, but are relatively uncommon near coral reefs and in shallow tropical seas. A few species occur in brackish water. The disc shape is rhomboidal, and the tail long. Two dorsal fins are found and the caudal fin is much reduced. The pelvic fins have two lobes. Most species have rough skins with dermal denticles which are especially obvious along the spine. The eggs are laid in a protective hard case with string-like elongations at the four corners. The extinct families Sclerorhynchidae and Ptychotrygonidae had long, serrated rostrums very similar to those of extant sawsharks and sawfishes, and their relation to them has been debated. A 2004 study found sawsharks to actually be the most basal of batoids rather than true sharks, with the order Sclerorhynchiformes containing Sclerorhynchidae and Ischyrhizidae and forming a sister group to sawfish and all other rays, with the clade containing sawsharks and rays being coined Pristiorajea. However, further studies have affirmed that sawsharks are true sharks and a member of Selachimorpha. A 2019 study instead found Sclerorhynchiformes to be a paraphyletic assemblage of rays within Rajiformes and leading up to Rajidae, and thus downgraded Sclerorhynchidae and Ptychotrygonidae to being families within the suborder Sclerorhynchoidei of the order Rajiformes, with Ischyrhiza, Schizorhiza, and Onchopristis not belonging within Sclerorhynchidae despite their similar appearance, and instead forming an unnamed sister group to Rajidae itself. Biology In most rajoids, water for breathing is taken in through the spiracles rather than through the mouth and exits through the gill slits. Most species swim by undulating their enlarged pectoral fins, but the guitarfish propel themselves through the water with sideways movements of their tail and caudal fin. Most species are carnivores, feeding on molluscs and other invertebrates on the sea bed, and small fish, but the manta ray feeds on plankton sieved out of the water as it swims by its wide open mouth. Some species are viviparous, others ovoviviparous (both giving birth to live young), but the skates lay eggs in horny cases known as mermaid's purses. Most species are benthic, resting on the sandy or muddy sea bed, sometimes undulating their pectoral fins to stir up sediment and bury themselves shallowly. Others, like the manta ray, are pelagic, and continually cruise the ocean.

Its one-design weight-equalised system enables physically differing sailors to compete on a level playing field. It is most popular in Europe, particularly the UK, France and Italy. The 4000 is a fast, planing skiff-style dinghy with a trapeze for the crew and trampolines for the helm. Upwind, the boat does not point especially close to the wind, but its fully battened sails give enough power to keep up with similar-sized boats. Downwind, however is where the boat excels due to its asymmetric spinnaker (a.k.a. gennaker). In a force 3 the 4000 will plane and the crew will make full use of the trapeze wire. However, force 4-5 is when the boat performs its optimum. The 4000 is fast enough to make use of the apparent wind to reach the bottom of the racecourse sooner. In lighter winds, many crews make use of the jibing gennaker pole when sailing downwind. This allows them to show a larger part of the spinnaker to the wind whilst sailing further away from the wind direction. Features The Laser 4000 was designed in 1994 by yacht designer Phil Morrison. It is a sloop rigged dinghy constructed from fiberglass. It features a single trapeze as well as an open, self-draining cockpit. Instead of a conventional kicking strap it features a gnav system, which pushes down on the boom from the top, instead of pulling from the bottom. This allows greater space for the crew to move from side to side. Boat manufacture is well known to be of a very high quality and durability, thus hulls from the very first molds are still competing effectively. However recently Laser has handed over the rules and administration of the class to the Laser 4000 class association and thus there is significant scope for boat improvement. Many people want to see the addition of carbon spars and lighter hulls (nickname = 4 tonner!). However the class is adamant that it will stay a one class design and not a class open to unlimited modification such as the International 14 class. Friendly competition Over the years the Laser 4000 events have given the fleet a reputation as competitive but friendly, with the day's racing followed by lively evening socials. The equalisation system coupled with relatively low sheet loads mean that a good variety of people are able to sail the boat. Equalisation system A long-running problem in dinghy racing is that light sailors are faster in light winds due to their lesser displacement and heavier sailors gain speed in stronger winds due to their increased righting moment. In the early 90s Laser addressed this problem with their equalisation system for both the Laser 5000 and Laser 4000. When racing one of these boats, lightweight crews are required to carry up to 4 lead weights in their boat (securely fastened in the centre). To compensate for their lack of capsize- preventing leverage, they are also allowed to extend the boat's rack outwards, effectively making the boat wider. Conversely, heavier crews will carry fewer weights, but must sail with narrower racks. Thus each team's total weight and leverage is equalised. The Laser 4000 equalisation system accommodates helms and crews weighing from 59–94 kg (130-207 lbs) each. Beyond that range the traditional wind strength advantages and disadvantages come into play. Years of competitive racing have proved the system to be effective with all sizes of crews winning in all wind strengths. Several other racing dinghy classes have adopted a similar equalisation systems. As with many modern racing dinghies, the Laser 4000 is one-design, meaning that strict rules govern the modification of the boat, its sailing and equipment. This is to prevent an expensive competition of \\"modification racing\\", where only those who could afford the latest gadgets would stand a chance of winning.

It was created on July 1, 1954, by splitting the numbering plan area (NPA) 402 along a roughly S-shaped boundary line from the western half of the Nebraska–South Dakota border to the approximate center of the Nebraska–Kansas border. A roughly 50-mile segment of the line running northeast to southwest in the eastern third of the state follows the Platte River. With Nebraska's population concentrated along the Missouri River on the state's eastern edge, numbering plan area 308 is one of the most sparsely populated in the nation. According to projections, 308 will remain in its current configuration until at least 2050, as its supply of telephone numbers is in no immediate danger of exhaustion.Staff (April 2020). \\"2020-1 NRUF and NPA Exhaust AnalysisApril 2020 NPA Exhaust Forecasts Sorted By NPA\\" (PDF format).

She is most widely remembered as the voice of the first Disney villain, the Queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Walt Disney's first feature film as well as her final film role. Biography La Verne was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on November 7, 1872. She began her career as a child in local summer stock. As a teenager, she performed in small touring theater troupes. When she was 14, she played both Juliet and Lady Macbeth back to back. Her ability to play almost any part quickly caught the attention of more prolific companies, and she made her Broadway debut in 1888. She then became a leading lady with some of the best stock companies in America, scoring triumphs in San Francisco, Boston, and other cities. She eventually ran her own successful stock company. On the New York stage, she was known for her range and versatility. Among her hits on Broadway were principal roles in Uncle Tom's Cabin, Seven Days and Way Down East. She was also known for her blackface roles. Her biggest stage triumph came in 1923 when she created the role of Widow Caggle in the hit play Sun Up. With her Broadway run, US tour, and European tour, La Verne gave over 3,000 performances. She also worked on Broadway as a playwright and director. In the late 1920s, a Broadway theater was named for her for a short period of time. She made her motion picture debut in 1915 in the movie Over Night directed by James Young. She also performed a small part in the movie Orphans of the Storm, directed by D.W. Griffith. Her best known part is that of the voice of the Queen, and her alter ego the old hag, from Disney's 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which was her final film performance. Death La Verne died at the age of 72 in Culver City, California on March 4, 1945 after suffering from cancer. She was interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery.

According to Mystici corporis, to be truly (reapse) a member of the Mystical Body one must be a member of the Roman Catholic Church. Other Christians who erred in good faith could be unsuspectingly united to the Mystical Body by an unconscious desire and longing (inscio quodam desiderio ac voto). It is one of the more important encyclicals of Pius XII because of its topic, the Church, which was strongly debated and further developed in the Second Vatican Council document on the Church, Lumen gentium. Mystici corporis identified the earthly presence of this body with the Catholic Church, at a time of much theological debate on the meaning of 'Mystical Body'. While the Holocaust is not explicitly mentioned, the earthly effects of being a part of this body are clearly emphasized. According to the Jesuit theologian Avery Dulles, Mystici corporis was \\"the most comprehensive official Catholic pronouncement on the Church prior to Vatican II.\\"Avery Dulles, “A Half Century of Ecclesiology,” Theological Studies, 50 (1989), 420-431. Its primary writer Sebastiaan Tromp drew mainly on the first schema of Vatican I and on the encyclicals of Leo XIII.Sullivan, SJ, Francis (2006). \\"Quaestio Disputata: A response to Karl Becker, SJ, on the Meaning of Subsistit in\\" (PDF). Theological Studies. 67: 395–409. It de-emphasized papal jurisdiction but insisted on the visibility of the church, warning against an excessively mystical understanding of the union between Christ and the Church.  Background  The encyclical builds on a theological development in the 1920s and 1930s in Italy, France, Germany and England, which all re-discovered the Pauline concept of the Mystical Body of Christ.La Cristologia in Italia 1930-1990, Sergio de Marchi, Piemme, 1994, P. Parente, De Verbo Incarnato, 1933, Hofmann, Der Kirchenbegriff des hl. Augustinus, München 1933, H. Käppeli, Zur Lehre des hl. Thomans von Aquin vom Corpus Christi Mysticum, Freiburg, 1931, E Mersch, Le Corps Mystique du Christ 2 Vol. Paris, 1936, A E Rawloson, Corpus Christi Mysticum, Berlin, 1931, Robinson, H Wheeler, The Cross of the Servant, London, 1926 In 1936, Emile Mersch had warned of some false mysticisms being advanced with regard to the mystical body, and his history of this topic was seen as influencing the encyclical.The Whole Christ: The Historical Development of the Doctrine of the Mystical Body in Scripture and Tradition, (Wipf & Stock Pub, 2011). On 18 January 1943, five months before the promulgation of Mystici corporis, Archbishop Conrad Gröber of Fribourg promulgated a letter in which he addressed the docetic tendencies of some mystical body theology (to separate the spiritual and the material elements in man). Timothy Gabrielli saw Pius' emphasis on the church as a perfect society on earth as an attempt to save the mystical body theology, with its many theological, pastoral, and spiritual benefits, from the danger of docetism. Mystici corporis did not receive much attention during the war years but became influential after World War II. It had rejected two extreme views of the Church.Heribert Mühlen, Una Mystica Persona, München, 1967, p.51 # A rationalistic or purely sociological understanding of the Church, according to which she is merely a human organization with structures and activities. The visible Church and its structures do exist but the Church is more, she is guided by the Holy Spirit: \\"Although the juridical principles, on which the Church rests and is established, derive from the divine constitution given to it by Christ and contribute to the attaining of its supernatural end, nevertheless that which lifts the Society of Christians far above the whole natural order is the Spirit of our Redeemer who penetrates and fills every part of the Church\\".Pius XII, Enc. Mystici corporis Christi, 63 # An exclusively mystical understanding of the Church is mistaken as well, because a mystical “Christ in us” union would deify its members and mean that the acts of Christians are simultaneously the acts of Christ. The theological concept una mystica persona, one mystical person refers not to an individual relation but to the unity of Christ with the Church and the unity of its members with Him in her.S Tromp, Caput influit sensum et motum, Gregorianum, 1958, pp353-366 Legacy Role of the laity = The encyclical teaches that both lay people and the leadership have a role to play in the Church. Lay people are at the forefront of the Church, and have to be aware of 'being the Church', not just 'belonging to the Church'. At the same time, the Pope and bishops are responsible for providing leadership for all the faithful. Together, they are the Church and work for the good of the Church.Pius XII, Discourse, February 20, 1946:AAS 38 (1946) 149; quoted by John Paul II, CL 9. In 1947, Pius XII later issued the Apostolic Constitution Provida Mater Ecclesia, which allowed lay people to form their own secular communities, and establish them within a newly established Canon Law framework.Pius XII, Apostolic Constitution Provida Mater Ecclesia, Vatican city, 1947 = Apostles and bishops = The encyclical states that Christ, while still on earth, instructed by precept, counsel and warnings \\"in words that shall never pass away, and will be spirit and life\\"Cf. John VI, 63. to all men of all times. He conferred a triple power on His Apostles and their successors, to teach, to govern, to lead men to holiness, making this power, defined by special ordinances, rights and obligations, the fundamental law of the whole Church.Pius XII, Enc. Mystici corporis Christi, 38 God governs directly and guides personally the Church which He founded. Pius XII quoted Proverbs 21:1 noting that God reigns within the minds and hearts of men, and bends and subjects their wills to His good pleasure, even when rebellious..\\"Proverbs, XXI, 1Pius XII, Enc. Mystici corporis Christi, 39 Mystici corporis requests the faithful to love their Church and to always see Christ in her, especially in the old and sick members. They must accustom themselves to see Christ Himself in the Church. For it is Christ who lives in His Church, and through her, teaches, governs, and sanctifies; it is Christ also who manifests Himself differently in different members of His society. If the faithful strive to live in a spirit of lively faith, they will not only pay due honor and reverence \\"to the more exalted members\\" of this Mystical Body, especially those who according to Christ’s mandate will have to render an account of our souls, but they will take to their hearts those members who are the object of our Savior’s special love: the weak, the wounded, and the sick who are in need of material or spiritual assistance; children whose innocence is so easily exposed to danger in these days; and finally the poor, in helping whom is recognized the very person of Jesus Himself as a perfect model of love for the Church.Pius XII, Enc. Mystici corporis Christi, 93 = Opposition to Nazism = Pius XII wrote: \\"The Church of God … is despised and hated maliciously by those who shut their eyes to the light of Christian wisdom and miserably return to the teachings, customs and practices of ancient paganism.\\" He quoted the book of Wisdom to the effect that \\"a most severe judgment shall be for them that bear rule. ...The mighty shall be mightily tormented. ...A greater punishment is ready for the more mighty.\\" Ronald Rychlak has described the encyclical as \\"an obvious attack on the theoretical basis of National Socialism.\\" = Killing of disabled people = Pius' statement of \\"profound grief\\" at the murder of the deformed, the insane, and those suffering from hereditary disease... as though they were a useless burden to Society\\" was a condemnation of the ongoing Nazi euthanasia program, under which disabled Germans were being removed from care facilities and murdered by the state as \\"life unworthy of life\\". It built upon the high- profile condemnations offered by the bishop of Munster, Clemens August Graf von Galen and others. It was followed, on 26 September 1943, by an open condemnation by the German Bishops which, from every German pulpit, denounced the killing of \\"innocent and defenceless mentally handicapped, incurably infirm and fatally wounded, innocent hostages, and disarmed prisoners of war and criminal offenders, people of a foreign race or descent\\".Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; 2008 pp.529-30 = Exclusion on the basis of race or nationality = Pius XII appealed to \\"Catholics the world over\\" to \\"look to the Vicar of Jesus Christ as the loving Father of them all, who… takes upon himself with all his strength the defense of truth, justice and charity.\\" He explained, \\"Our paternal love embraces all peoples, whatever their nationality or race.\\" Christ, by his blood, made the Jews and Gentiles one \\"breaking down the middle wall of partition… in his flesh by which the two peoples were divided.\\" He noted that Jews were among the first people to adore Jesus. Pius then made an appeal for all to \\"follow our peaceful King who taught us to love not only those who are of a different nation or race, but even our enemies.\\" Pinchas E. Lapide, the Israeli consul in Italy, wrote: \\"Pius chose mystical theology as a cloak for a message which no cleric or educated Christian could possibly misunderstand.\\" In the United States, it would be seen as a critique of any kind of prejudice against African-Americans.Ruth Fox, “Catholicism and Racism,” Interracial Review 17 (February 1944), 25; Catherine de Hueck Doherty, “The Baroness Jots It Down,” Harlem Friendship House News (April 1944), 6. =Forced conversions= Mystici corporis Christi strongly condemned the forced conversions to Catholicism that were then occurring in Fascist Croatia. Church membership and conversions must be voluntary. Regarding conversions, \\"We recognize that this must be done of their own free will; for no one believes unless he wills to believe.\\"Cf. August., In Ioann. Ev. tract., XXVI, 2: Migne, P.L. XXX, 1607. Hence they are most certainly not genuine Christians who against their belief are forced to go into a church, to approach the altar and toCf. August., In Ioann. Ev. tract., XXVI, 2: Migne, P.L. XXX, 1607 receive the Sacraments; for the \\"faith without which it is impossible to please God\\" is an entirely free \\"submission of intellect and will.\\"Vat. Counc. Const. de fide Cath., Cap. 3 = Mariology = The encyclical concludes with a summary of the mariology of the Pope. The 1854 dogma of the Immaculate Conception by Pius IX defined the Virgin conceived without sin, as the mother of God and our mother. Pope Pius XII built on this in Mystici corporis: Mary, whose sinless soul was filled with the divine spirit of Jesus Christ above all other created souls, \\"in the name of the whole human race\\" gave her consent \\"for a spiritual marriage between the Son of God and human nature\\",Office for Holy Week thus elevating human nature beyond the realm of the purely material. She who, according to the flesh, was the mother of our Head, became mother of all His members. Through her powerful prayers, she obtained that the spirit of our Divine Redeemer, should be bestowed on the newly founded Church at Pentecost.Pius XII, Enc. Mystici corporis Christi, 110 While the Early Fathers of the Church tended to contrast Eve's disobedience with Mary's fiat at the Annunciation, Pius looked rather to her presence at Calvary where \\"...she, the second Eve, who, free from all sin, original or personal, and always more intimately united with her Son, offered Him on Golgotha to the Eternal Father for all the children of Adam, sin- stained by his unhappy fall.\\"Pope Pius XII. Mystici corporis Christi, §110, June 29, 1943, Libreria Editrice Vaticana Pius viewed her compassion there as the basis for her role in redemption.Jelly, Frederic M., Madonna: Mary in the Catholic Tradition, Wipf and Stock Publishers, 1998 If the Mother of God was born as the \\"second Eve\\", the Church was born as the \\"new Eve\\". Pius XII repeated that, according to \\"unanimous teaching\\" of the holy Fathers and the magisterium of Christ, the \\"Church was born from the side of our Savior on the Cross like a new Eve, mother of all the living.\\" = Ecumenicism = The encyclical is principally remembered for its statement that the Mystical Body is identical with the Roman Catholic Church, repeated by Pius XII in Humani generis (1950) in response to dissension. According to Mystici corporis, to be truly (reapse) a member of the Mystical Body one must be a member of the Roman Catholic Church. Other Christians who erred in good faith could be unsuspectingly united to the Mystical Body by an unconscious desire and longing (inscio quodam desiderio ac voto). In 1947, Pius XII wrote the encyclical Mediator Dei which acknowledged that baptized Christians were members of the Mystical Body and participated in Christ's priestly office. During the Second Vatican Council, Yves Congar argued that the term ecclesia ('church') concerned the people \\"called forth\\", the People of God, those over whom God reigns. \\"Body of Christ\\" then would emphasize the special union with the risen Christ that came with the new covenant. Congar was later denounced by the Holy Office for describing the Church as essentially a community in the Spirit, a gathering of the faithful. The Second Vatican Council would later define in Lumen gentium that the Church subsists in (subsistit in) the Catholic Church. Dulles argues this to be \\"an expression deliberately chosen to allow for the ecclesial reality of other Christian communities\\", implying that non-Catholic Christians are members of the Body of Christ, and thus of the Church.

This results in the medium then having many properties and characteristics of normal fluids, such as the ability to free- flow under gravity, or to be pumped using fluid type technologies. The resulting phenomenon is called fluidization. Fluidised beds are used for several purposes, such as fluidized bed reactors (types of chemical reactors), solids separation, fluid catalytic cracking, fluidized bed combustion, heat or mass transfer or interface modification, such as applying a coating onto solid items. This technique is also becoming more common in aquaculture for the production of shellfish in integrated multi-trophic aquaculture systems.Wang, JK, 2003. Conceptual design of a microalgae-based recirculating oyster and shrimp system. Aquacultural Engineering 28, 37-46  Properties  A fluidised bed consists of fluid-solid mixture that exhibits fluid-like properties. As such, the upper surface of the bed is relatively horizontal, which is analogous to hydrostatic behavior. The bed can be considered to be a heterogeneous mixture of fluid and solid that can be represented by a single bulk density. Furthermore, an object with a higher density than the bed will sink, whereas an object with a lower density than the bed will float, thus the bed can be considered to exhibit the fluid behavior expected of Archimedes' principle. As the \\"density\\", (actually the solid volume fraction of the suspension), of the bed can be altered by changing the fluid fraction, objects with different densities comparative to the bed can, by altering either the fluid or solid fraction, be caused to sink or float. In fluidised beds, the contact of the solid particles with the fluidisation medium (a gas or a liquid) is greatly enhanced when compared to packed beds. This behavior in fluidised combustion beds enables good thermal transport inside the system and good heat transfer between the bed and its container. Similarly to the good heat transfer, which enables thermal uniformity analogous to that of a well mixed gas, the bed can have a significant heat-capacity whilst maintaining a homogeneous temperature field.  Application  Fluidized beds are used as a technical process which has the ability to promote high levels of contact between gases and solids. In a fluidised bed a characteristic set of basic properties can be utilised, indispensable to modern process and chemical engineering, these properties include: *Extremely high surface area contact between fluid and solid per unit bed volume *High relative velocities between the fluid and the dispersed solid phase. *High levels of intermixing of the particulate phase. *Frequent particle-particle and particle-wall collisions. Taking an example from the food processing industry: Fluidized beds are used to accelerate freezing in some individually quick frozen (IQF) tunnel freezers. These Fluidized bed tunnels are typically used on small food products like peas, shrimp or sliced vegetables, and may use cryogenic or vapor-compression refrigeration. The fluid used in Fluidized beds may also contain a fluid of catalytic type; that's why it is also used to catalyse the chemical reaction and also to improve the rate of reaction. Fluidized beds are also used for efficient bulk drying of materials. Fluidized bed technology in dryers increases efficiency by allowing for the entire surface of the drying material to be suspended and therefore exposed to the air. This process can also be combined with heating or cooling, if necessary, according to the specifications of the application.  History  In 1922, Fritz Winkler made the first industrial application of fluidisation in a reactor for a coal gasification process. In 1942, the first circulating fluid bed was built for catalytic cracking of mineral oils, with fluidisation technology applied to metallurgical processing (roasting arsenopyrite) in the late 1940s. During this time theoretical and experimental research improved the design of the fluidised bed. In the 1960s VAW-Lippewerk in Lünen, Germany implemented the first industrial bed for the combustion of coal and later for the calcination of aluminium hydroxide.  Fluidised bed types  Bed types can be coarsely classified by their flow behavior, including: *Stationary or bubbling fluidised bed is the classical approach where the gas at low velocities is used and fluidisation of the solids is relatively stationary, with some fine particles being entrained. *Circulating fluidized beds (CFB), where gases are at a higher velocity sufficient to suspend the particle bed, due to a larger kinetic energy of the fluid. As such the surface of the bed is less smooth and larger particles can be entrained from the bed than for stationary beds. Entrained particles are recirculated via an external loop back into the reactor bed. Depending on the process, the particles may be classified by a cyclone separator and separated from or returned to the bed, based upon particle cut size. *Vibratory fluidized beds are similar to stationary beds, but add a mechanical vibration to further excite the particles for increased entrainment. *Transport or flash reactor (FR). At velocities higher than CFB, particles approach the velocity of the gas. Slip velocity between gas and solid is significantly reduced at the cost of less homogeneous heat distribution. *Annular fluidized bed (AFB). A large nozzle at the center of a bubble bed introduces gas as high velocity achieving the rapid mixing zone above the surrounding bed comparable to that found in the external loop of a CFB. * Mechanically Fluidised Reactor (MFR). A mechanical stirrer is used to mobilize particles and achieve properties similar to that a well-mixed fluidised bed. It does not require fluidisation gas.Chaudhari, Mitesh C., \\"Effect of Liquid-Solid Contact on Thermal Cracking of Heavy Hydrocarbons in a Mechanically Fluidised Reactor\\" (2012). Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Repository. Paper 1009. http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/1009 *Narrow fluidized beds (NFB). For this case, the ratio between the tube and the grain diameters is equal or less than around 10. The dynamics of the bed is then different from the other types of fluidized beds because of strong confinement effects, and the presence of granular plugs, consisting of regions with high concentrations in solids alternating with low solids concentrations, is common. Bed design A diagram of a fluidised bed = Basic model = When the packed bed has a fluid passed over it, the pressure drop of the fluid is approximately proportional to the fluid's superficial velocity. In order to transition from a packed bed to a fluidised condition, the gas velocity is continually raised. For a free-standing bed there will exist a point, known as the minimum or incipient fluidisation point, whereby the bed's mass is suspended directly by the flow of the fluid stream. The corresponding fluid velocity, known as the \\"minimum fluidisation velocity\\", u_{mf}. Beyond the minimum fluidisation velocity ( u \\\\geq u_{mf} ), the bed material will be suspended by the gas- stream and further increases in the velocity will have a reduced effect on the pressure, owing to sufficient percolation of the gas flow. Thus the pressure drop for u > u_{mf} is relatively constant. At the base of the vessel the apparent pressure drop multiplied by the cross-section area of the bed can be equated to the force of the weight of the solid particles (less the buoyancy of the solid in the fluid). \\\\Delta p_{w} = H_{w} (1- \\\\epsilon_{w}) (\\\\rho_{s} - \\\\rho_{f}) g = [M_{s} g / A] [(\\\\rho_{s} - \\\\rho_{f}) / \\\\rho_{s}] where: \\\\Delta p_{w} is the bed pressure drop H_{w} is the bed height \\\\epsilon_{w} is the bed voidage, i.e. the fraction of the bed volume that is occupied by the voids (the fluid spaces between the particles) \\\\rho_{s} is the apparent density of bed particles \\\\rho_{f} is the density of the fluidising fluid g is the acceleration due to gravity M_{s} is the total mass of solids in the bed A is the cross-sectional area of the bed = Geldart Groupings = In 1973, Professor D. Geldart proposed the grouping of powders in to four so- called \\"Geldart Groups\\". The groups are defined by their locations on a diagram of solid-fluid density difference and particle size. Design methods for fluidised beds can be tailored based upon the particle's Geldart grouping: Group A For this group the particle size is between 20 and 100 µm, and the particle density is typically less than 1.4g/cm3. Prior to the initiation of a bubbling bed phase, beds from these particles will expand by a factor of 2 to 3 at incipient fluidisation, due to a decreased bulk density. Most powder- catalyzed beds utilize this group. Group B The particle size lies between 40 and 500 µm and the particle density between 1.4-4g/cm3. Bubbling typically forms directly at incipient fluidisation. Group C This group contains extremely fine and consequently the most cohesive particles. With a size of 20 to 30 µm, these particles fluidise under very difficult to achieve conditions, and may require the application of an external force, such as mechanical agitation. Group D The particles in this region are above 600 µm and typically have high particle densities. Fluidisation of this group requires very high fluid energies and is typically associated with high levels of abrasion. Drying grains and peas, roasting coffee beans, gasifying coals, and some roasting metal ores are such solids, and they are usually processed in shallow beds or in the spouting mode. = Distributor = Typically, pressurized gas or liquid enters the fluidised bed vessel through numerous holes via a plate known as a distributor plate, located at the bottom of the fluidised bed. The fluid flows upward through the bed, causing the solid particles to be suspended. If the inlet fluid is disabled, the bed may settle, pack onto the plate or trickle down through the plate. Many industrial beds use a sparger distributor instead of a distributor plate. The fluid is then distributed through a series of perforated tubes.

The film was directed by Herbert Ross, instead of Allen, who usually directs his own written work. The film is about a recently divorced film critic, Allan Felix, who is urged to begin dating again by his best friend and his best friend's wife. Allan identifies with the movie Casablanca and the character Rick Blaine as played by Humphrey Bogart. The film is liberally sprinkled with clips from the movie and ghost-like appearances of Bogart (Jerry Lacy) giving advice on how to treat women. Plot Set in San Francisco, the film begins with the closing scenes of Casablanca, with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. We then see that the main character, Allan Felix, is watching the film in a cinema, mouth agape. He leaves the cinema regretting that he will never be like Rick. Apart from apparitions of Bogart, Allan also has frequent flashbacks of conversations with his ex-wife, Nancy, who constantly ridiculed his sexual inadequacy. Allan has just been through a messy divorce. His best friend, Dick Christie, and Dick's wife, Linda, try to convince him to go out with women again, setting him up on a series of blind dates, all of which turn out badly. Throughout the film, he is seen receiving dating advice from the ghost of Bogart, who is visible and audible only to Allan. Allan's ex-wife Nancy also makes fantasy appearances, as he imagines conversations with her about the breakdown of their marriage. On one occasion, the fantasy seems to run out of control, with both Bogart and Nancy appearing. When it comes to women, he attempts to become sexy and sophisticated, in particular he tries to be like his idol, Bogart, only to end up ruining his chances by being too clumsy. Eventually, he develops feelings for Linda, around whom he feels relatively at ease and does not feel the need to put on the mask. At the point where he finally makes his move on Linda (aided by comments from Bogart), a vision of his ex-wife appears and shoots Bogart, leaving him without advice. He then makes an awkward move. Linda runs off but returns, realizing that Allan loves her. The song \\"As Time Goes By\\" and flashes from Casablanca accompany their kiss. However, their relationship is doomed, just as it was for Rick and Ilsa in Casablanca. Dick returns early from Cleveland and confides to Allan that he thinks Linda is having an affair, not realizing that her affair is with Allan. Dick expresses to Allan his love for Linda. The ending is an allusion to Casablanca's famous ending. Dick is catching a flight to Cleveland, Linda is after him, and Allan is chasing Linda. The fog, the aircraft engine start-ups, the trenchcoats, and the dialogue are all reminiscent of the film, as Allan nobly explains to Linda why she has to go with her husband, rather than stay behind with him. Allan quotes a closing line from Casablanca, saying, \\"If that plane leaves the ground and you're not on it, you'll regret it; maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.\\" \\"That is beautiful\\", Linda says, causing Allan to admit, \\"It's from Casablanca. ... I've waited my whole life to say it!\\" His journey is complete. Bogart praises him, saying that since he has learned how to be himself now, he doesn't need him for advice anymore. The music from the scene in Casablanca resumes the theme \\"As Time Goes By\\", and the film ends. Cast * Woody Allen as Allan Felix, a neurotic, recently divorced writer * Diane Keaton as Linda Christie, Dick's wife, with whom Allan falls in love * Tony Roberts as Dick Christie, Allan's best friend and Linda's husband, a workaholic businessman in real estate * Susan Anspach as Nancy, Allan's ex-wife * Jerry Lacy as Humphrey Bogart * Jennifer Salt as Sharon * Joy Bang as Julie * Viva as Jennifer Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman appear in archival appearances from Casablanca as Richard \\"Rick\\" Blaine and Ilsa Lund respectively. Reception Play It Again, Sam received a very positive critical response and currently holds a 97% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews, with an average grade of 7.4 out of 10. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the film, giving it three out of four stars and saying, \\"as comedies go, this is a very funny one.\\" He elaborated, concluding, \\"Maybe the movie has too much coherence, and the plot is too predictable; that's a weakness of films based on well-made Broadway plays. Still, that's hardly a serious complaint about something as funny as Play It Again, Sam.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune also gave it three out of four stars, writing, \\"For those who prefer their films with a beginning, middle and an end, and, consequently, were unsettled by the hellzapoppin' plots of 'Bananas' or 'Take the Money and Run,' 'Play It Again Sam' will provide warmth, sanity, and an unconventional story with laughs.\\"Siskel, Gene (May 26, 1972). \\"Play It Again...\\" Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 5. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"a very funny film\\" although he felt that \\"the shape of the ordinary Broadway comedy, with three acts and a beginning, middle and end, inhibit the Woody Allen that I, at least, appreciate most.\\"Canby, Vincent (May 5, 1972). \\"Woody Allen's 'Play It Again, Sam'\\". The New York Times. 30. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film was \\"in the tradition of the best bright comedies of the past, full of funny lines and situations but supported and enriched by an accurately perceived and recognizable character whose own consistency provides the logic for mad events and a lasting power for the laughter.\\"Champlin, Charles (May 21, 1972). \\"'Play It Again, Sam' a Comedy of Character\\". Los Angeles Times. Calendar, p. 1, 26. David McGillivray of The Monthly Film Bulletin called it \\"a treat for Woody Allen fans and a quite amusing, unobjectionable comedy for everyone else,\\" though he thought it \\"hardly improves\\" on the original play. Influence Quentin Tarantino said on his commentary track for True Romance (1993) that the character of Elvis Presley as portrayed by Val Kilmer, who appears to Christian Slater's character and gives advice and assurance, was based on the Bogart character in this film. The song \\"Beautiful and Light\\" by Tunng contains samples from the film. The Second City comedy troupe's television show SCTV parodied the film. Play It Again, Bob stars Allen (Rick Moranis) and Bob Hope (Dave Thomas).

While being interviewed on the radio program Conversations With Allan Wolper on WBGO 88.3 FM, Cutler said that he was inspired by his father's pro-labor, pro-union loyalties to a FDR-style Social Democratic position.Bruce Cutler on Conversations With Allan Wolper Growing up in Flatbush, he graduated from Poly Prep Country Day School. Cutler gained notoriety in the 1980s when he won three acquittals for Gambino Crime Family boss John Gotti (including one where at least one juror accepted a bribe in return for voting to find Gotti not guilty). When Gotti was indicted in 1990 for the 1985 murder of Paul Castellano and several other crimes, presiding judge I. Leo Glasser disqualified Cutler and two associates from representing Gotti. Citing evidence from wiretaps at Gotti's Ravenite club, prosecutors contended that Cutler and his colleagues may have known about criminal activity. Since the attorney-client privilege does not apply in these circumstances, prosecutors argued that Cutler was \\"part of the evidence\\" and thus liable to be called as a witness. They also argued that Cutler had represented other potential witnesses and thus had a conflict of interest. Glasser sided with the prosecutors, contending that Cutler was the \\"in-house counsel\\" for the Gambino family.The GoodfatherLast Arrest Cutler appeared in the Robert De Niro and Ed Burns film, 15 Minutes, playing himself.

When she was twelve, she met fiddler Stuart Duncan. In the summer of 1978, Brown traveled across the country with Duncan and his father, playing at festivals and contests. She won first place at the Canadian National Banjo Championship, which helped her land a one-night gig at the Grand Ole Opry. [ Alison Brown bio on www.allmusic.com] Family She is married to bass player Garry West. She has a daughter, Hannah West, and a son, Brendan West. Harvard University and Northern Lights In 1980, Brown went to Harvard University, where she studied history and literature. After graduating from Harvard, she earned an MBA from UCLA. In 1982, while still at Harvard, Brown helped to reunite the Northern Lights band after a 5-year hiatus, she became a band member until 1984, when she moved back to California. Brown worked for two years with Smith Barney in San Francisco, and then took a break to pursue her music interests.History of Northern Lights at www.northernlightsband.com Union Station and other collaborations In 1987, Alison Krauss asked Brown to join her band, Union Station. Brown spent three years with Krauss. In 1990, she moved to Tennessee, and was named International Bluegrass Music Association Banjo Player of the Year in 1991. The 1990 album I've Got That Old Feeling, which Brown played banjo on, won a Grammy award.Interview with producer Bill VornDick about Grammy award for album I've Got That Old feeling on www.mesesmuse.com In 1992, Brown became the band leader for Michelle Shocked.

Orthodox Christian Information Center. Accessed 2010-10-08. Catholic, Anglican and Methodist traditions. According to Pope Peter of Alexandria, the Friday fast is done in commemoration of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ on Good Friday. Abstinence is colloquially referred to as \\"fasting\\" although it does not necessarily involve a reduction in the quantity of food. In Catholicism, specific regulations are passed by individual episcopates. In the United States in 1966, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops passed Norms II and IV that bound all persons from age fourteen to abstain from meat on Fridays of Lent and through the year. Previously, the requirement to abstain from meat on all Fridays of the year applied for those age seven or older. Canons 1252 and 1253 of the Code of Canon Law express this same rule, and added that Bishops may permit substitution of other penitential practices for Fridays outside of Lent, but that some form of penance shall be observed on all Fridays of the year in commemoration of the day of the week of the Lord's Crucifixion.Penitential Practices for Today's Catholics. United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Accessed 2007-12-07. Abstinence on all Fridays outside of Lent is still the preferred practice among many Catholics, who choose to maintain this tradition rather than substituting an alternative penance. Most episcopal conferences have not allowed the substitution of an alternative penance for Fridays of Lent. No episcopal conference has lifted the obligation for either fasting or abstinence for Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. In Catholicism The Current practice of fast and abstinence is regulated by Canons 1250–1253 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law. They specify that all Fridays throughout the year and the time of Lent are penitential times throughout the entire Church. All adults (those who have attained the 'age of majority', which is 18 years in canon law) are bound by ecclesial law to fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday until the beginning of their sixtieth year. All persons who have completed their fourteenth year are bound by the law of abstinence on all Fridays unless the Friday is a solemnity, and again on Ash Wednesday; but in practice, this requirement has been greatly reduced by the Episcopal Conferences because under Canon 1253, it is these Conferences that have the authority to set down the local norms for fasting and abstinence in their territories. The precept to both fast and abstain on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday is usually not dispensed from.) Catholics may eat only one full meal on a fast day. Additionally, they are permitted eat up to two small meals or snacks, known as collations. Church requirements on fasting only relate to solid food, not to drink, so Church law does not restrict the amount of water or other beverages – even alcoholic drinks – which may be consumed. Church law on fasting has changed over the centuries since fasting is a discipline which may be altered by legitimate Church authorities. In Methodism \\"The General Rules of the Methodist Church,\\" written by the founder of Methodism, John Wesley, wrote that \\"It is expected of all who desire to continue in these societies that they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation, by attending upon all the ordinances of God, such are: the public worship of God; the ministry of the Word, either read or expounded; the Supper of the Lord; family and private prayer; searching the Scriptures; and fasting or abstinence.\\" The Directions Given to Band Societies (25 December 1744) mandated fasting and abstinence from meat on all Fridays of the year, a practice that was reemphasized by Phoebe Palmer and became standard in the Methodist churches of the holiness movement. The Methodist tradition encourages its adherents to fast on Fridays, especially on those during the Lenten season. John Wesley required fasting on both Wednesdays (in remembrance of the Betrayal of Christ) and Fridays (in remembrance of His crucifixion and death) for those seeking holy orders. In Anglicanism Anglican formularies, particularly the Book of Common Prayer, have generally required abstinence from meat on Fridays, though it is difficult to gauge how widely followed this practice has been among Anglicans. The wording in the 1928 Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church describes \\"All the Fridays in the Year, except Christmas Day and the Epiphany, or any Friday which may intervene between these Feasts\\" as days \\"on which the church requires such a measure of abstinence as is more especially suited to extraordinary acts and exercises of devotion\\".Tables and Rules for the Movable and Immovable Feasts,Together with the Days of Fasting and Abstinence, through the Whole Year, p. 3 of 6.

It is one of Australia's oldest standing residences, being built in c.1834. It is located at the site of Experiment Farm, Australia's first European farmstead, which was itself created by Australia's first land grant. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History In 1789, James Ruse was chosen by Governor Arthur Phillip to run an experiment to see how long it would take a man to support himself. Ruse was granted of cleared land, as well as assistance for clearing an additional . He was also provided with two sows and six hens. He was fed and clothed from the public store for 15 months, after which time he had become successfully self- sufficient and was granted an additional . In October 1793, Ruse sold his farm to surgeon John Harris, builder of the substantial colonial cottage which exists today. Harris already owned the adjacent property. At the time Harris had many varied roles in the colony, including Magistrate, Deputy Judge Advocate, Superintendent of Police and Naval Officer. He went on to become one of the wealthiest pastoralists in the colony, owning extensive properties in New South Wales.Hoffman, 2013, 10 Harris, born in County Londonderry, Ireland, spent at least ten years in the Navy as a surgeon's mate, and sailed in New South Wales in his own 21 foot wherry. He was a soldier when serving as an officer in the New South Wales Corps. In the roles of judge advocate and magistrate he functioned as a lawyer. As a public servant in the early 1800s and again in the mid-1820s he was head policeman: as a naval port officer he was a tax man and a government spy. As a builder occasionally contracted by government he constructed the road to South Head in 1803 and public buildings including a toll house in Parramatta in 1829. Displaying the skills of an architect and design engineer he oversaw construction of the 59 ton government schooner, \\"Integrity\\", the Sydney Court House and his own substantial dwellings at Parramatta, Ultimo and South Creek. He was a farmer and a grazier; an explorer who participated in several expeditions including that of Colonel William Paterson to the Hunter in 1803 and Surveyor John Oxley's 1818 expedition to the interior; a mercantile agent; and a banker, being one of the founding directors of the Bank of New South Wales - the colony's first bank. A busy many, he played many of these roles while serving as a surgeon to the New South Wales Corps. While never a pauper, when he served as a surgeon's third mate in the Royal Navy in India during the 1770s and 1780s he was not affluent. Yet, by the early 1800s he was a rich man. In 1804 he constructed the first two storeyed verandahed house in the colony (Ultimo House) and had imported deer from India as hunt quarry. In 1814 he gave architect Francis Greenway his first private commission.Rosen, 2007, 13 The cottage is in the form of the Indian Bungalow, a verandahed form Harris saw in Bengal, India from his arrival in 1782, that was used to house English officers on service there. The cottage's form originated in Bengal, which was the first region the British moved from coastal forts to occupy the interior. Such Anglo-Indian dwellings were primarily used as residence or a place for both living and working, with an office incorporated into the plan. Their builders used traditional Indian strategies to respond to climatic conditions, maximising ventilation and shade and protection from heavy rain while meeting European expectations of form and comfort. It emerged as a \\"culturally distinctive house form\\", the typical \\"up-country\\" dwelling for British officials. This form had its attractions for Harris in New South Wales when he not only attended outpatients but occasionally accommodated the very ill at his home. The hot summers and cool winters of Sydney had more in common with Bengal than Moneymore. The tightly closed houses of Ireland, designated to minimise draughts, were not appropriate in India or New South Wales. The bungalow as adopted by the British was characterised by a pitched thatched roof, a verandah and a raised base platform. It was a free-standing single storey structure. The verandah was sometimes adapted by the British to encircle the house with parts semi-enclosed for privacy and shade. WIth the possible exception of the thatching, these essential qualities are also characteristics of Experiment Farm Cottage, constructed in the mid-1790s at Parramatta by Harris.Rosen, 2007, 18-19 Dr Wilson's bungalow house at Moidapur bears striking similarities with Harris' Experiment Farm Cottage. Both have a verandah integrated into the roof, both are built on a platform, both have shutters, and both have part of the verandah partially enclosed. Both men were in Bengal in the early 1780s.Rosen, 2007, 21 The property stayed in the Harris family until 1921, when the land was subdivided and the suburb of Harris Park was created. The site was acquired by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) in 1961, after the establishment of the Women's Committee including women such as Dame Helen Blaxland and Rachel Roxburgh, which raised the necessary funds of 4,500 pounds. This committee was established to raise funds, source furnishings and promote Trust membership. Experiment Farm Cottage was the first property the National Trust (NSW) acquired and the Trust restored and furnished the cottage with colonial pieces and opened it to the public. Ms Roxburgh wrote the first guide books for the property for the Trust. In 1960 Cherry Jackaman joined Dame Helen Blaxland on the Women's Committee of the National Trust (NSW). Jackaman chaired this committee from 1964–67 and by 1968 had raised more than $100,000, which was directed to repairs work at Experiment Farm Cottage, Lindesay and the St. Matthews Anglican Church at Windsor Appeal. In 1963 the cottage was opened by the National Trust (NSW) as Australia's first house museum with a focus on Australian colonial furniture. In 1967 the National Trust reconstituted the Lindesay Garden Group as the National Trust Garden Committee, with Diana Pockley as chair. This Committee's work was broader, including work on replanting the grounds of Experiment Farm Cottage, Parramatta, Old Government House, Parramatta and Riversdale, Goulburn. A Parramatta Properties Committee was established to advise and guide works, dating (at least) from 1968, and chaired from 1971-2 by Dame Helen Blaxland. This committee was disbanded in 1984. Since acquisition, Federal and State Government funds have been made available to also purchase adjoining blocks of land/ houses and demolish these, helping to create a more credible landscape setting for what was John Harris' simple farm cottage complex. Centenary of Federation funds from the Federal Government allowed implementation of a reinstated simple farm garden based on evidence of early - mid 19th century garden plantings around the cottage, including appropriate farm fencing, reinstated plantings such as giant Danubian reed (Arundo donax) on the north-east corner of the cottage, and a bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) to its north. These same funds allowed the closure of Ruse Street to the west of the cottage, reinstatement of a narrowed carriage drive in front (north) of the cottage, and a new reduced width public road access east of the cottage connecting to Ruse Street (east), based on the location and form of a known earlier farm track.Heritage Office, 2003 In preparation for the 50th anniversary of the opening of the cottage as a house museum by the Trust, the cottage has undergone a much-needed restoration program of works, funded by the Dame Helen Blaxland Foundation and NSW State Heritage Grants. It was reopened to the public in July 2013, with a celebration of the 50th anniversary of its first public opening, with NSW Governor and National Trust Patron Marie Bashir re-enacting the 1963 event. Visitation increased from 3581 in 2012/13 to 4557 in 2013/14. The caretaker's cottage was refurbished in 2014 making it suitable for rental accommodation, and work on the rear garden was carried out under the supervision of Colleen Morris, enhancing its appeal for events.Silink & Hayes, 2014  Description  Experiment Farm Cottage is an Old Colonial Georgian house with symmetrical front and low pitched hipped roof continuous over verandah of vertically seamed iron. The entrance consists of a six-panelled door flanked by sidelights and with an elliptical fanlight above. It sits in a small domestic garden with some mature trees, including jacaranda, (Jacaranda mimosaefolia), lemon scented gum (Corymbia citriodora), fruit trees and cottage plants. Since 2001 a more appropriate 19th century pleasure garden to the north has been reconstructed, based on early photographs and records, and comprising 2 large oval beds with mixed tree and shrub planting, a series of \\"framing\\" trees including a hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamiana) and others. Ruse Street's eastern end is closed off from the west and now accessed by a new diversion local street, on the alignment of a known former farm track, immediately to the east of Experiment Farm Cottage. This road is finished as though it were a gravel farm track, and farm-style post and rail fencing abuts it, and Alice Street to the south. The remaining setting of Experiment Farm Cottage is of an early 1900s residential subdivision, of mostly single-storey California bungalow cottages, with some later infill of blocks of flats, dating from the 1960s, and some 1980s & 1990s single houses, some two storey. This is the last subdivision of the Harris Farm estate, and its boundary represents (roughly) the of land originally granted to James Ruse in 1788.

During the 1970s & 1980s a number of residential allotments adjoining Experiment Farm Cottage were resumed by the Federal Government with the aim of improving the setting of the Cottage. The houses on these allotments were demolished and the ownership of the newly created open space area was transferred to Parramatta City Council, to become part of the James Ruse Reserve. The boundary of the reserve was extended up to Experiment Farm Cottage. Through the creation of the reserves around the cottage, continuous park area now extends from Hambledon Cottage and Hassall Street (in the north-east and north) south to Experiment Farm Cottage and Alice Street in the south * 2000-01: NSW National Trust undertook a landscape reconstruction of some of the immediate 19th century pleasure garden and carriage drive north of Experiment Farm Cottage. These works focussed on the lands around Ruse Street and south toward Alice Street. Ruse Street's eastern end was closed off and access redirected immediately to the east of Experiment Farm Cottage, along the alignment of a known former farm track. The new road was built to resemble a farm track, in finish, and fencing of a rural nature was installed on both sides of the new road. A carriage drive on the alignment of the original 19th century carriage drive replaced the former Ruse Street in front (north) of Experiment Farm Cottage. The remainder of the street surface and furniture (power poles, kerbs etc.) were removed or put underground and a pleasure garden based on early photographs and records was reconstructed. No. 14 Ruse Street was acquired by the Trust and demolished (1920s California bungalow), and its grounds incorporated into the reconstructed landscape of Experiment Farm Cottage, widening its views north and the public views south up the hill from Hassall Street/James Ruse Reserve * 2000-1: Parramatta City Council installed a new pedestrian footbridge over Clay Cliff Creek north of Experiment Farm Cottage to provide easy access as part of the Harris Park Heritage Walk, a series of works to install a pedestrian path, landscaping and interpretive signage along a series of heritage items including Hambledon Cottage and Experiment Farm Cottage * 2013: The 2013 restorations helped stabilise emerging problems including underpinning the north-east corner, internal plastering and painting, new electrical circuitry and power upgrade and re-rendering the cellar.

The initial success of Experiment Farm encouraged Phillip to open the Parramatta area to free settlement; * the location demonstrates the importance of the Parramatta area in the agricultural development and early survival of the European colony; * Following its purchase by Surgeon John Harris, it became part of \\"Harris' Farm\\", one of several large properties established by the \\"Parramatta Gentry\\" from the late 18th- mid 19th century, including those owned by the Macarthurs, Marsdens, Kings, Wentworths and Blaxlands. The current Experiment Farm Cottage formed part of \\"Harris' Farm\\"; * It contains evidence of the various phases of the site from the late 18th century to the present, including: * the topographical features associated with Ruse's Experiment Farm; * the establishment of Harris' Farm and the construction of Experiment Farm Cottage; * patterns of subdivision and the emergence of the present suburban setting; * Experiment Farm Cottage is a finely detailed colonial bungalow dating to c.1834. Its sophisticated design is demonstrated through the architectural treatment of the front facade, including French doors, delicate columns and main entrance, and the internal treatment of room configuration and its methods of integrating the verandah into the main area of the house; * of its visual prominence in the surrounding landscape. The position of Experiment Farm Cottage demonstrates important relationships with the landscape. Situated on a once prominent rise, the current house addresses the north towards Parramatta River and Clay Cliff Creek; * of its surviving fabric (both extant and archaeological), and the vast body of records documenting its historical development. In particular, resources from the 19th century provide information on the development and layout of Harris' Farm, including Experiment Farm Cottage and associated farm features such as former fence lines, carriage drive, farm roads, plantings, stables, outbuildings and pattern of subdivision; * of its documented association with individuals who have helped shape its form and use, including Governor Phillip, James Ruse, Surgeon John Harris and his descendants, Pieter Laurentz Campbell and the Fraser family; * it is a place highly valued by the community. Efforts by the community since the 1920s have assisted in its conservation, culminating in the acquisition of the property by the NSW National Trust in 1961. Local residents have expressed great interest in the ongoing conservation of the property and recognise its heritage significance as contributing towards the identity of Harris Park. Heritage listing Experiment Farm cottage has a strong association with the earliest free settlement of land in Australia and with the first grant to a freed convict, James Ruse. It also has a strong association with John Harris. The house is a rare example of an early farmhouse in very intact condition. Site possesses archaeological potential to contribute to an understanding of early development in Parramatta. Experiment Farm Cottage was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Experiment Farm cottage was built and occupied by John Harris (1754-1838), surgeon of the colony and pioneer farmer. It was the site of the first successful agriculture in Australia, commenced by the first owner of the property James Ruse (1760-1837) and continued and developed by Harris and, on the adjacent property, John and Elizabeth Macarthur. It demonstrates the lifestyle of the early propertied colonial gentry, those in positions of power and influence in post-1788 Australian society. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Experiment Farm cottage is an archetypal Australian colonial house and helped pioneer the use of the verandah which became a major identifying feature of Australian architecture. The cottage is an elegant example of colonial Georgian rural architecture and demonstrates with substantial intactness the layout and functions of such buildings. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Experiment Farm cottage is widely held in high regard (both locally and nationally) as a strong link with Australia's early colonial past, this regard being demonstrated also in past attempts to recover some of the original setting of the house. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The cottage and its site have the potential to yield worthwhile historical and archaeological information. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The dance is accompanied by music played by monks using traditional Tibetan musical instruments. The dances often offer moral instruction relating to karuṇā (compassion) for sentient beings and are held to bring merit to all who perceive them. Chams are considered a form of meditation and an offering to the gods. The leader of the cham is typically a musician, keeping time using some percussion instrument like cymbals, the one exception being Dramyin Cham, where time is kept using dramyin.

The word is a neologism in the Spanish of Argentina, coming from piquete (in English, \\"picket\\"), that is, its specific meaning as a standing or walking demonstration of protest in a significant spot. The trend was initiated in Argentina in the mid-1990s, during the Administration of President Carlos Menem, soon becoming a frequent form of protest that still prevails on the South American socio-political scene. Seventy percent of the piqueteros are women, and some of their leaders are women too, like Milagro Sala from Jujuy. The piqueteros organizations have also been criticized at times fierce from multiple sectors of society Argentina, accusing them of being associated with organized crime and demanding taking legal action against its manifestations acts contrary to the dictates of the Constitution Argentina which Article 14 states that must be guaranteed to every citizen the right to: :\\"... enter, remain in, travel in and out of Argentine territory.\\" And, in turn, according to art. 194 of the Penal Code, provides that: :\\"Whoever, without creating a situation endangering the community, prevent, hinder or delay the normal operation of transport by land, water or air or utilities communications, water supply, electricity or energy substances shall be punished with imprisonment three months to two years\\" Origins of the Piqueteros The piqueteros appeared first in June 1996 in the Patagonian town of Cutral Có, province of Neuquén, when workers laid off by then state-owned oil company YPF blocked National Route 22.\\"Pickets Unfenced.\\" The Economist 13 Dec 2003: Like many other small towns throughout Argentina, Cutral-Có depended almost exclusively on the jobs provided by a single local company. Piqueteros as a national phenomenon During the latter half of the 1990s, as the Argentine economy lost competitiveness and exports markets due to the over-valued fixed exchange rate, and many former state companies were sold to private corporations, many Argentines lost their jobs. The piquetero form of protest soon spread to the impoverished neighbourhoods and de-industrialized towns of Greater Buenos Aires, starting in Florencio Varela and La Matanza, as well as other provinces. In 1997 there were 23 roadblocks in Buenos Aires Province, and a total of 77 in the whole country. Eventually, piqueteros began assembling in a more organized fashion, forming \\"Unemployed Workers Movements\\" (Movimientos de Trabajadores Desempleados, abbreviated as MTDs). Protests expanded from major road-blocking pickets, to blockades of important streets in, or just outside, cities, as well as bridges and accesses to economically critical spots (for example, directly in front of major stores and supermarkets). In some instances, government buildings were blocked and occupied by force. The MTDs also began involving themselves in co-operatives for a myriad of purposes, such as barter markets for goods and services, small-scale food production, sewing workshops, food-ration distributing facilities, etc. A number of piqueteros now participate, support, or otherwise have ties with the recovered factory movement (for example in the former ceramic tile factory Zanon, now FaSinPat). Piqueteros during the crisis Protesters deface a facility of SIDE. In 2002, two piqueteros, Darío Santillán and Maximiliano Kosteki, were killed during protests at the Avellaneda train station, few blocks from the New Pueyrredón Bridge of Buenos Aires. Judicial investigations and the Argentine press blame the Secretariat of Intelligence (SIDE) for participation in the organization of these events. On the second anniversary of the killings, a defacement of one of SIDE's bases was done in protest. Involvement of SIDE has not been proven so far. In early 2006, Alfredo Fanchiotti and Alejandro Acosta, two policemen who participated in the repression, were convicted of murder. Relatives and comrades of the piqueteros killed that day, claim that the prosecutor and the judge intentionally avoided looking for the politician that ordered and directed the repression. Political involvement in the MTDs The success of the MTDs soon attracted the attention of political actors, from two main fronts: old, traditionally fragmented leftist parties and movements, and the Peronist Party. During the late 1990s, piqueteros in Greater Buenos Aires came to overlap with the manzaneras, agents of the anti-Menem Peronist machine of provincial governor Eduardo Duhalde. By 2005, many large MTDs in Buenos Aires were co-opted, either by radical, intransigent left-wing ideological factions, or by the local Peronist municipal administrations, linked to former Buenos Aires governor and then interim president Eduardo Duhalde, and others to supporters of former president Néstor Kirchner. The Peronist Party connection is particularly important given that piquetero groups have acquired a hierarchical structure, where benefits are shared from the top down, and in many cases the heads of the movements serve as intermediaries for the distribution of government welfare subsidies, from which each member of the piquetero organization must discount a small sum to support the logistics of the protests, the hiring and maintenance of assembly facilities, etc. Welfare subsidies come for example under the forms of Planes Trabajar, which consist in 20 hours per week \\"contracts\\" used by public institutions and paid 150 pesos (less than 50 USD) a month. Criticism and fragmentation Criticism towards piqueteros and MTDs comes from three sides: middle-class Argentinians, right-wing political actors, and piqueteros themselves. Among the decimated, but still numerous, Argentine middle class, the common criticism is that piqueteros, while morally and legally entitled to protest and demonstrate, should not do so by blocking important roads and streets, since this violates other people's right to circulate freely and often results in delays (from the relatively trivial problem of arriving home later after work, to the very serious of ambulances with critical patients being stopped by a picket). The so-called \\"violent\\" attitude of some piqueteros, who cover their faces with scarfs or handkerchiefs, as a claimed form of protection against police retaliation, and who wield sticks, can be interpreted as a visible threat towards passers-by and police; this is usually pointed out as proof. On occasion, critics can become violent as well,when faced with a picket. So, people who criticize the piqueteros may agree with the need to provide relief for the poor and unemployed, but disagree on the form of the demands. The political right, speaking mainly through politicians and journalists, but resonating with many other Argentinians, overtly or covertly equates piqueteros with criminals. Violent incidents with piqueteros have ended up with people wounded, cars and houses damaged, etc. Even non-violent blockades are formally illegal, if they cause serious disruption. Occupation of state and private buildings, including supermarkets and casinos, followed by demands of money and food supplies, has also occurred in the recent past. People advocating the application of the law against blockades request that the government outlaw the protests and suppress them, using violent means if necessary. However, most pickets end without violence. Piqueteros themselves have become fragmented, as explained above. The movements supported by leftist parties, as well as the independent ones, criticize piquetero leaders, who have chosen to support the national Kirchner administration (which is viewed by them as a relatively progressive government). In turn, the left-wing piqueteros are portrayed by the others as representatives of an unproductive, non-constructive radical opposition, sometimes encouraging violent action.

Description The trail occupies three non-contiguous sections of an abandoned Chicago Great Western Railway corridor in suburban Chicago and a section in Iowa that have been converted into biking and hiking trails. Western section The westernmost, and older, section of the Great Western Trail is located between western St. Charles in Kane County and eastern Sycamore in DeKalb County. This section was right-of-way that was abandoned in 1977. The path of fine crushed stone traverses unincorporated rural townships, natural wetlands, some restored prairies, and farmland. The trail also passes through Virgil and Lily Lake and parallels Illinois Route 64. Eastern section West Chicago, at the western terminus, June 2006 The newer of the two sections, between Villa Park and West Chicago in DuPage County, is made up of right-of-way that was abandoned piecemeal throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. As the railway was abandoned, the government of DuPage County made upgrades to the path, and between 1990 through 1992, the trail was converted from a rail grade to a bicycle trail. The crushed stone path crosses some farmland and suburban areas. At the east end of the trail is a restored former CGW depot building. The Great Western trail also was extended to make a connection with the Illinois Prairie Path in 1995. In 1998, a new bridge was built over Interstate 355, while the next year, a new bridge was built over the West Branch of the DuPage River. A new three-bridge pedestrian overpass in Lombard spans St. Charles Road, the Metra Union Pacific West Line tracks and Grace Street. The Lombard bridge complex is approximately 2 miles east of the Interstate 355 bridge, and these four bridges unify the eastern four miles of the trail. This eastern section of Great Western Trail starts at Villa Avenue in Villa Park joined to the Illinois Prairie Path and rejoins the Illinois Prairie Path just west of Prince Crossing Road in West Chicago. In 2018, the trail was extended further west to Sassafras Drive in West Chicago. The Great Western Trail is designated as DuPage County Highway 55 for its entire length.

Nonconcatenative morphology, also called discontinuous morphology and introflection, is a form of word formation and inflection in which the root is modified and which does not involve stringing morphemes together sequentially. TypesAblaut= In English, for example, while plurals are usually formed by adding the suffix -s, certain words use nonconcatenative processes for their plural forms: *foot → feet ; Many irregular verbs form their past tenses, past participles, or both in this manner: *freeze → froze , frozen . This specific form of nonconcatenative morphology is known as base modification or ablaut, a form in which part of the root undergoes a phonological change without necessarily adding new phonological material. In traditional Indo-Europeanist usage, these changes are termed ablaut only when they result from vowel gradations in Proto-Indo-European. An example is the English stem s⌂ng, resulting in the four distinct words: sing-sang-song-sung. An example from German is the stem spr⌂ch \\"speak\\", which results in various distinct forms such as spricht-sprechen-sprach-gesprochen-Spruch. Changes such as foot/feet, on the other hand, which are due to the influence of a since- lost front vowel, are called umlaut. Other forms of base modification include lengthening of a vowel, as in Hindi: * \\"die\\" ↔ \\"kill\\" or change in tone or stress: *Chalcatongo Mixtec \\"filth\\" ↔ \\"dirty\\" *English record (noun) ↔ \\"to make a record\\" Consonant apophony, such as the initial-consonant mutations in Celtic languages, also exists. =Transfixation= Another form of nonconcatenative morphology is known as transfixation, in which vowel and consonant morphemes are interdigitated. For example, depending on the vowels, the Arabic consonantal root k-t-b can have different but semantically related meanings. Thus, 'he wrote' and 'book' both come from the root k-t-b. Words from k-t-b are formed by filling in the vowels, e.g. kitāb \\"book\\", kutub \\"books\\", kātib \\"writer\\", kuttāb \\"writers\\", kataba \\"he wrote\\", yaktubu \\"he writes\\", etc. In the analysis provided by McCarthy's account of nonconcatenative morphology, the consonantal root is assigned to one tier, and the vowel pattern to another. =Reduplication= Yet another common type of nonconcatenative morphology is reduplication, a process in which all or part of the root is reduplicated. In Sakha, this process is used to form intensified adjectives: \\"red\\" ↔ \\"flaming red\\". =Truncation= A final type of nonconcatenative morphology is variously referred to as truncation, deletion, or subtraction; the morpheme is sometimes called a disfix. This process removes phonological material from the root. In French, this process can be found in a small subset of plurals (although their spellings follow regular plural-marking rules): /os/ \\"bone\\" ↔ /o/ \\"bones\\" /bœf/ \\"ox\\" ↔ /bø/ \\"oxen\\" Semitic languages Nonconcatenative morphology is extremely well developed in the Semitic languages in which it forms the basis of virtually all higher-level word formation (as with the example given in the diagram). That is especially pronounced in Arabic, which also uses it to form approximately 41% of plurals in what is often called the broken plural.

Pope Pius X. Pascendi Dominici gregis, 8 September 1907, Libreria Editrice Vaticana Context Pius X viewed the church as under siege, intellectually from rationalism and materialism, politically from liberalism and anti-clericalism. The pope condemned modernism, a loose movement of Catholic biblical scholars, philosophers and theologians who believed that the church could not ignore new scientific historical research concerning the Bible.Steinfels, Peter. \\"Fighting Modernists, a Decree Shaped Catholicism\\", The New York Times, 1 September 2007 Maude Petre would later recall, \\"We must remember, in fairness to those who were not always fair, that the impact of historical criticism on the traditional teaching of the Church was terrifying; that it seemed a case of saving the very essence of the Christian faith from destruction.\\" Talar, C.J.T. \\"Introduction: Pascendi dominici gregis The Vatican Condemnation of Modernism\\". U.S. Catholic Historian, vol. 25 no. 1, 2007, pp. 1-12. Project MUSE Alfred Loisy held that only scientific exegesis is verifiable and therefore, reliable. Interpretation based on faith, on the other hand, \\"is a purely subjective\\". This discounts entirely the value of revelation. Concerning Jesus, \\"In the person of Christ, they say, science and history encounter nothing that is not human. Therefore, in virtue of the first canon deduced from agnosticism, whatever there is in His history suggestive of the divine, must be rejected.\\". The threat was seen as more severe as appearing to come from member of the ordained clergy. Much of the encyclical was drafted by Joseph Lemius, Procurator General of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate,Darrell Jodock, Catholicism Contending With Modernity page 20, and page 110, note 66 (Cambridge University Press, 2000). and Capuchin Cardinal José Calassanç Vives y Tuto.Magister, Sandro. \\"The Encyclical Against the \\"Modernists\\" Turns 100 – But Without Fanfare\\", L'Espresso, 23 October 2007 It condemned the proposition that religion is merely a sentiment based on a psychological need for the divine. The fundamental error attributed to the modernists was that of denying the capacity of reason to know the truth, thereby reducing everything – including religion, and including Christianity – to subjective experience. Modernists rejected this interpretation, saying their focus was on historical criticism of sacred texts. Following the example of the bishops of Umbria, Pius X directed the bishops to establish councils to look into any errors being promoted in their dioceses and to inform the bishop thereof, with particular attention given to the curriculum and texts used in the seminaries and schools. It also reiterated a 1896 decree of the Congregation of Indulgences and Sacred Relics that \\"Ancient relics are to retain the veneration they have always enjoyed except when in individual instances there are clear arguments that they are false or suppositions.'Pope Pius X. Pascendi Dominici gregis, 8 September 1907, §55, Libreria Editrice Vaticana If however, the bishop knows the relic is not authentic, it is to be withdrawn from veneration, and if authentication has been lost due to civil disturbances, no relic may be presented for public veneration before the bishop has verified it.

In alleviating hazards from landslides, many slopes adjacent to main roads and developments on Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong needed to be secured. Between the 19th century and World War II, the Hong Kong Government and other contractors constructed masonry stone walls to prevent these hazards. Not until the last two decades have slopes been stabilised through cementing. In early constructed walls, opened joints between stones allowed strong species like banyans to sprout. Traffic and human activities carry on despite the growth of these plants, which further stabilise the retaining walls they are growing on. As time goes by, sprouts mature into fully developed stone wall trees. Distribution As of today, 1275 stone wall trees are situated on 504 masonry stone retaining walls,http://www.ecc.org.hk with 110 walls in the Central and Western District, where most walls remain,http://www.foe.org.hk in Chinese only with many others in Wan Chai District. A majority of these trees have lived for over a century. According to the Conservancy Association, some notable trees are located at:http://www.conservancy.org.hk =Hong Kong Island= The largest tree is an over-a-century-old Chinese banyan (Ficus microcarpa), located in Forbes Street, near Forbes Street Playground. Another tree on Bonham Road near Centre Street had a height of around 20 metres, and was the tallest in the city, however it fell on 22 July 2015 in a storm.

More than 12 wall trees exist at the site and most of them are Chinese banyan and common red-stem fig. All of them are mature trees with a height between 3 and 11 metres high. The special one is those common red-stem fig. It is a unique phenomenon for those particular wall trees since the majority of wall trees in Hong Kong are Chinese banyan. It is the only site in Hong Kong, which have a dozen common red-stem fig trees in one location, which its buttress root adapted to the condition of the masonry walls. The nullah, therefore, is a scene with special scientific value for further study. Comparing the trees planted in the park next to the nullah, the trees in the nullah are rich in biodiversity. Various kinds of birds could be found on those trees along the nullah, for example, yellow wagtail and white wagtail etc. Besides, the trees around nullah formed a green canopy and functioned as a green lung for the community. For all those years, the trees benefited the community, for example, by minimizing the heat island effect. Lai Chi Kok Hospital HACare Home There is also a Chinese banyan growing on the masonry wall next to Lai Chi Kok hospital, HACare Home. Ecological value In the beginning, greenery of the site was not taken into consideration during road constructions. Roads built at that time were often narrow and had no space for adding canopy by simply planting trees. Trees naturally emerged from the walls taking up no additional space at ground level, and shield the pathways from heat during the summer. Tall wall trees, especially banyans, also improve air quality by filtering particulates and blocking heat emitted from automobiles and building-wide air conditioning systems, that would otherwise be trapped between skyscrapers, generating air pollution. Biodiversity is maintained through these trees by providing habitats for birds and various insects. The integrity of the retaining wall may be enhanced or compromised, depending on the size of the tree that develops, the disposition of its roots and to what extent the roots have been able to penetrate through the wall. Cultural value Stone wall trees in Hong Kong have become a part of the landscape in communities, as most of them have existed since before World War II. The artistic shapes and endurance of these trees won appreciation from nearby residents, which transform into an indispensable part of the collective memories of the community. Some senior residents believe that the trees can improve Feng Shui and bring positive prospects towards the neighbourhood. Wall trees also create a beneficial environment that enables higher property prices around the trees compared to other premises in the area.

History Launch = Quiz Call was launched as a standalone participation television channel in August 2005 on the Freeview and NTL platforms, and launched on the Sky Digital platform shortly afterwards. The show encourages viewers to enter by calling a premium-rate telephone number or for free via their website. On 22 April 2006, the channel made its début on analogue terrestrial television when it aired overnight on Five. In June 2006, Quiz Call had a slight revamp. They replaced half of the original set with a purple and gold themed set. This set was used mainly as their set for use when broadcasting on Five. The graphics also changed at this time. On 6 August 2006, Quiz Call gave viewers a unique opportunity to win a brand-new car. Callers who got through to the studio had their name put into a bowl and at the end of the broadcast the person who was selected was called back live on air to answer a question. The car was won by Tracy from Newquay. On 1 September 2006, Quiz Call celebrated its first birthday with a 41 Hour Marathon Live Broadcast giving viewers the chance to play for a jackpot of £100,000 by guessing a 4-digit combination. =Sale= On 19 October 2006, Channel 4 announced they would be selling Ostrich Media and announced the sale of Ostrich Media to iTouch Media on 3 November 2006.MediaGuardian (free subscription required) The sale included the Quiz Call channel, its slots on NTL and digital satellite, as well as the company's back room technology including its customer relations management capability. The deal did not however, include the slot on Freeview, and since 15 November 2006, Channel 4 used the space to broadcast Film4+1, and subsequently Channel 4+1. The loss of the slot on Freeview had reduced the broadcasting hours from 12:00 – 03:00 to 19:00 – 01:00. During this time, the channel maintained a position on Freeview as it was shown on Ftn, between 22:00 and 01:00. This agreement ended on 1 January 2007. =Sky EPG slot closure= Quiz Call withdrew from the Sky EPG on 1 January 2007. Viewers were at first greeted by a caption stating Quiz Call will be back in mid-January this was then replaced by a test card with the Quiz Call logo and information stating that The service has now ceased. The channel was removed from the EPG soon afterwards. =Return as Five show= Subsequently, in 2007, Ostrich Media was commissioned by Five to produce a run of Quiz Call to broadcast as a programme within the late night/early morning slot on the channel and sister channel Five USA. This arrangement saw Five – which had trialled a run of Quiz Call before switching to The Great Big British Quiz in 2006 – drop TGBBQ and revert to using Quiz Call as their late night quiz provider. On a number of occasions in 2008, Quiz Call has switched from Five to Five US because of live sport being shown on Five. The cash amounts decreased enormously from sometimes the highest cash amount being £2,000 and then dropped to £500. =Removal of the show= On Thursday 10 September, presenter Liz Fuller announced that Quiz Call would end on Five on Saturday 12 September 2009 after a run of almost 3 years. The decision to end Quiz Call came after Five signed a deal with NetPlay TV to broadcast Live Roulette on Five three nights a week; these broadcasts, which were made possible due to the relaxation of the rules regarding such broadcasts on UK terrestrial TV, replaced Quiz Call in the schedule. The official Quiz Call website states that the show intends to return at an unspecified point in the future. The show may return as a standard Freeview channel. The Quiz Call website has been taken off the Internet but there is still the possibility of the show returning in the Future. Show format A grid or table of money amounts is shown on screen. Behind each amount lies an answer to the main question. The main question is normally given in a clue word with associated answer. For example, Films 'M', Black____ or Things That Are Red. A possible 10 – 18 answers are available with numerous outcomes but only the answers on the grid/table are correct. The top prize answers worth £1,000, £2,000 and £3,000 were generally difficult but not totally unheard of (such as Marge Simpson's necklace, The headlights on the 'KITT' car from Knight Rider or the seats in the House of Lords – other answers were easier and would be fairly well known such as 'a postbox'). The host will take calls at random for callers to answer the question, and if it corresponds to an answer on the grid/table they will win a cash prize shown that is available. Around halfway through the show, when the presenters swap, the cash considerably drops. for example, the top answer that was worth £3000 drops down to around £500-£750, and the smallest answer of around £100-£250, drops to around £25-£50. Various situations will happen during the show as to how much is available, such as double, triple, 4×, 5×, 6×, 7×, 8×, 9× and even 10× the money, extra answers, instant wins or jackpot amounts. Since the show's relaunch on Five, it was revealed on 8 August 2009 that they had given away over £8 million in prizes and £650,000 had been given away in 2009, and on 27 August 2009, it was revealed £710,000 had been given away to 1930 winners so far in 2009. Controversy On 24 September 2006, Quiz Call admitted to The Sunday Times that they had manipulated games by blocking callers from taking part for periods of up to 40 minutes. Under headlines of \\"naked profiteering\\", Quiz Call said that on these occasions, it charged thousands of callers a standard 75p premium line fee – knowing that it would give them no chance to answer the prize question. At the culture, media and sport committee, held on 28 November 2006, representatives from Quiz Call admitted that one instance of people being put on hold did occur and that the producer responsible no longer works for Ostrich Media.Sherwin, Adam MPs condemn phone-in game shows as tantamount to fraud Published by The Sunday Times on 28 November 2006. Retrieved 2 December 2006. Quiz Call, which once offered a £100,000 jackpot, admitted that the show's producer was responsible for deciding how long callers had to wait to enter the games. It admitted that Quiz Call had been caught out cutting corners, in using its own staff to pose as prize winners, clutching 3-foot cheques in an on-air promotion, though there was no suggestion that any employees had been playing or winning the games.Swinford, Steven. TV quiz sets callers a costly question. Published by The Sunday Times on 24 September 2006. Retrieved 2 December 2006. The BBC Radio 4 programme You and Yours broadcast a segment on Quiz Call on 10 October 2006, who were contacted by listeners who had been barred by the channel. One listener, Mari Hamilton from Aylesbury who used the on-air name 'Luna', contacted the programme to say that they were blocked by the channel after winning a number of cash prizes using the free web entry option.Quiz channel bans by the BBC for the BBC Radio 4 programme You and Yours, broadcast 10 October 2006. Retrieved 10 October 2006 Quiz Call was removed from TV screens as part of Five's review into all its premium rate phone calling quiz programmes in March 2007, and returned on the evening of 30 March 2007. At least one independent individual has estimated Ostrich Media to be drawing more than £23,000 per hour of the show being on air, or around £100,000 per evening based on the new legal requirement to show the number of calls received in any particular minute.

This is a partial list of people pardoned or granted clemency by the President of the United States. The plenary power to grant a pardon or a reprieve is granted to the president of the United States by Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution; the only limits mentioned in the Constitution are that pardons are limited to federal offenses, and that they cannot affect an impeachment process: \\"The president shall ... have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment\\". Though pardons have been challenged in the courts, and the power to grant them challenged by Congress, the Court has consistently declined to put limits on the president's discretion. The president can issue a full pardon, reversing a criminal conviction (along with its legal effects) as if it never happened. A pardon can be issued from the time an offense is committed, and can even be issued after the full sentence has been served. The president can issue a reprieve, commuting a criminal sentence, lessening its severity, its duration, or both while leaving a record of the conviction in place. Additionally, the president can make a pardon conditional, or vacate a conviction while leaving parts of the sentence in place, like the payment of fines or restitution. Approximately 20,000 pardons and commutations were issued by U.S. presidents in the 20th century alone. Pardons granted by presidents from George Washington until Grover Cleveland's first term (1885–1889) were handwritten by the president; thereafter, pardons were prepared for the president by administrative staff requiring only that the president sign it. The records of these presidential acts were openly available for public inspection until 1934. In 1981 the Office of the Pardon Attorney was created and records from President George H. W. Bush forward are now listed.  George Washington  President George Washington pardoned, commuted, or rescinded the convictions of 16 people. Among them are: * Philip Vigol (or Wigle) and John Mitchel, convicted of treason for their roles in the Whiskey Rebellion  John Adams  Federalist president John Adams pardoned, commuted or rescinded the convictions of 20 people. Among them are: * David Bradford, for his role in the Whiskey Rebellion * John Fries, for his role in Fries's Rebellion; convicted of treason due to opposition to a tax; Fries and others were pardoned, and a general amnesty was issued for everyone involved. Thomas Jefferson Democratic-Republican president Thomas Jefferson pardoned, commuted or rescinded the convictions of 119 people. One of his first acts upon taking office was to issue a general pardon for any person convicted under the Sedition Act. Among them are: * David Brown – convicted of sedition under the Sedition Act of 1798 because of his criticism of the U.S. federal government, receiving the harshest sentence of anyone; pardoned along with all violators of the act. * Benjamin Fairbanks – Convicted with Brown of erecting a Liberty Pole in Dedham, Massachusetts.

Among them is: * George Wilson – convicted of robbing the United States mails. Strangely, Wilson refused to accept the pardon. The case went before the Supreme Court, and in United States v. Wilson the court stated: \\"A pardon is a deed, to the validity of which delivery is essential, and delivery is not complete without acceptance. It may then be rejected by the person to whom it is tendered; and if it is rejected, we have discovered no power in this court to force it upon him.\\" Rather than serve a sentence of 20 years, Wilson was executed by hanging.

He continued to plead the 5th, at which he was sentenced by a federal judge for contempt.

A veteran of broadcasting in New York City, Grant is considered a pioneer of the conservative talk radio format and was one of the early adopters of the \\"combat talk\\" format. Grant's career spanned from the 1950s until shortly before his death at age 84 on December 31, 2013. Grant was widely termed a political conservative, and personally considered himself to be a conservative with some libertarian leanings.  Career  Early work = As a high school student at Steinmetz High School in Chicago, Grant auditioned for the Central Radio Workshop of the Chicago Public Schools, where once every two weeks he would perform in plays on FM radio station WBEZ. After high school, Grant attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and studied journalism, where he also auditioned and got accepted for the school's radio station. As a student, Grant acted in plays, such as \\"the Duchess of Malfi\\". Grant left school early to take a job in radio. Grant originally got into professional radio when he answered a phone call for his roommate, and the program director calling thought he had a good voice. On May 14, 1948, Grant did his first professional news announcement, to discuss the formation of Israel. He then got a job at the news department at WBBM (AM) in Chicago and also continued acting in plays. Grant may have done other work as an extra, but he did not discuss his acting work much on his radio show. Grant also worked on a radio show called \\"Gold Coast\\" in the late 1950s, which had comedy skits. While at WBBM, he was forced to change his last name from \\"Gigante\\" to \\"Grant\\" in order to sound less ethnic. During the Korean War, he served in the Naval Reserve. Grant then moved from Chicago to Los Angeles. Grant's first radio work in Los Angeles was on radio station KNX (AM) in 1959, where he worked with future actor Paul Condylis on the Condylis & Grant Comedy Show. The Los Angeles Times stated, \\"Their names are Paul Condylis and Bob Grant, voted by this corner as the outstanding newcomers of 1959. Prime Examples Condylis and Grant, a couple of dialecticians from Chicago, specialize in a form of comedy that is most popular today satire.\\" Grant described the show as being similar to \\"Saturday Night Live\\" on the radio. Condylis and Grant would also entertain at places, such as college campuses. Afterwards Grant later became sports director at KABC (AM) in Los Angeles. Grant was then urged by co-worker and early controversial radio host Joe Pyne to substitute for him. Shortly after, John F. Kennedy was assassinated, and Pyne being a critic of Kennedy's was not allowed to host his show, and Grant substituted for him, eventually inheriting the show in 1964. Grant hosted three shows on KABC (AM) in 1964 titled, \\"Open Line,\\" \\"Night Line,\\" and \\"Sunday Line.\\" While at KABC Grant would interview celebrities including Muhammad Ali, controversial figures such as Kwanzaa founder Ron \\"Maulana\\" Karenga, and politicians including Ronald Reagan in what Grant claimed was Reagan's first interview as a political candidate in 1965. While Grant would become a controversial radio figure, he started off more mellow. He competed during nighttime radio against his former co-worker and mentor Joe Pyne and radio commentator Michael Jackson. An October 25, 1964 Los Angeles Times article describes Grant's broadcasting style: > Bob Grant is a relative newcomer, but his background is solidly radio, > having been a comedian, newscaster and sports announcer. He is the calmest > and more inquisitive. Grant's audience appears to be older and he deals less > in controversy than Pyne or Jackson. Grant, however, is versatile and > discusses subjects intelligently. He is much less a showman than his > counterparts. Grant moved from KABC (AM) to KLAC in March 1967. Some of Grant's colleagues at the station were Joel A. Spivak, Les Crane, and mentor Joe Pyne. Grant was described as Los Angeles' most controversial nighttime radio host.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1966/1966-06-27-BC.pdf In 1969, KLAC switched from a talk station to a music station. Grant was then asked to co-host a television show called \\"Tempo\\" with actress Jeanne Baird that aired on KHJ Channel 9 in Los Angeles from 11a.m. to 2p.m. After some controversies, including offending guest Marlo Thomas, Grant was eventually let go and replaced by Regis Philbin in July 1970. = Move to New York City (WMCA: 1970–1977) = Grant was approached to come to New York by executives at WMCA when WMCA was going to become a talk station. He was recommended to them by Jack Thayer, who had been the station manager of KLAC. Grant was opposed to the move, as he hated what he knew about New York, i.e., the subways, crime, and congestion. He also had four children and a home in Los Angeles. Grant was convinced to come to New York when an executive said to him at the end of a meeting, \\"It's just too bad that the number-one talk-show host in America doesn't want to come to the number-one market in America.\\" Grant came to New York and presented his first show on WMCA on September 21, 1970, where he worked for station manager R. Peter Strauss. After being in New York for a short time, Grant wanted to go back to Los Angeles. He was contacted by the former news director at KLAC, who was now a program director at another station to join his station, but Grant declined, because he had signed a two- year contract with WMCA. Grant's unhappiness being in New York led to him becoming angry with the callers. He hoped to get fired by R. Peter Strauss, however his ratings soared as he got angrier. Grant was quoted on May 23, 1971 about his new radio show in New York: > L.A. radio is really hip compared to New York. Here the scene is very > provincial and ethnic and liberal. Being a conservative, I am referred to by > most of my callers as the house right-winger or fascist. Actually, it gets > pretty funny, because they do more yelling at me than engaging in useful > debate. The audience in Los Angeles was much more sophisticated.\\" [...] > \\"Since WMCA started Dialog Radio, it’s really shot up in the ratings, we’ve > gone from around 12th to third in the market. Grant was distinctively out of fashion with both the times and with some countercultural WMCA personalities, including Alex Bennett. His offbeat, but combative style (along with Fairness Doctrine requirements of the era) won him seven years on WMCA, with a growing and loyal audience. Grant became well known for his abrasive manner with callers and his popular catch phrase, \\"get off my phone.\\" His sign-off for many years was \\"Get Gaddafi\\", which meant remove Muammar Gaddafi. In 1970, Grant quickly became a controversial opinion maker. Grant began saying, \\"we're slipping and sliding into third worldism\\", along with opposing the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Grant also came up with a solution to the high birthrate in the 1970s among poor women, which he called Bob Grant's Mandatory Sterilization Program or Act. This led to racism charges, but Grant denied that the program was only for minorities. On March 8, 1973, Grant had scheduled New York Rep. Benjamin S. Rosenthal, who was leading a boycott of meat. Grant later learned that Rosenthal would not appear on his show, and in a discussion with a caller, Grant referred to Rosenthal as a \\"coward\\". Rosenthal then filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission, and the issue went all the way up to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Straus Communications v. Federal Communications Commission, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, January 16, 1976, Wright, J. The appeals court ultimately ruled in favor of WMCA and Grant, due to the fact that Grant offered the congressman an invitation to appear on his show, granting Rosenthal equal time. Grant did an early shock jock stunt while at WMCA. A female listener had called in and was curious about pornographic films. Grant decided to take women who listened to him on a trip to a Times Square porno theater to view a porn film. About 100 women showed up for the trip, followed by a roundtable discussion on Grant's show. Grant would have two more listener trips to see a porn film after this. One of Grant's most memorable regular callers was Ms. Trivia, who aired her \\"Beef of the Week\\", a series of seemingly trivial complaints. Ms. Trivia was Grant's guest at a Halloween Festival dinner held at Lauritano's Restaurant in The Bronx, where a young Ms. Trivia, not long out of her teens, revealed herself for the first time to a startled radio audience, many who had expected and assumed, based upon her articulation and intonation, that she would be an elderly, prudish woman. Instead, a statuesque and fashionable Ms. Trivia, wearing an elaborate Victorian costume, was the surprise guest seated next to Grant at the dais table along with several political figures from New York. The following day the majority of calls to the show were for the purpose of obtaining information about the mysterious Mm. Trivia, with Grant in his typical manner finally in exasperation hanging up on the callers, shouting, \\"THIS IS NOT Mm. TRIVIA'S SHOW!\\" Grant popularized the -gry puzzle, a word game, on his WMCA show in 1975, stating some version of the question \\"There are three words in the English language that end in -gry. Two of them are angry and hungry. What is the third?\\". This has no conclusive answer, and spread following Grant's broadcast. While at WMCA, Grant attracted attention from a 1974 commentary he recorded, titled \\"How Long Will You Stand Aside\\". Grant also released an LP record in 1977 titled, \\"Let's Be Heard\\", which was a recording of a speech Grant gave before a synagogue in New York. Grant left WMCA in 1977. = WOR and WWDB = Grant began on WOR on Memorial Day, May 30, 1977, where he broadcast nights 11:30 p.m.–2:30 a.m. Grant took over the time-slot from host Barry Farber who hosted his show on it for 16 years, but had to give it up, because he was running for Mayor of New York City. According to producer Maurice Tunick, Grant had 24.3 share of the ratings at one point, meaning one in four people listening to the radio were listening to Grant's show.Tunick, Maurice (January 13, 2006). Bob Grant Farewell on WOR. Interview with Bob Grant. Bob Grant Show. WOR. New York. In 1979, Grant had gotten into trouble for some comments he had made and was fired from WOR. Grant was assisted by colleague Barry Farber who fought with WMCA station manager Ellen Straus to rehire Grant. Farber broadcast during the 4–7 p.m. weekday time slot on WMCA. When asked by Straus at a meeting if Farber was willing to give up his airtime for Grant, Farber replied, \\"Yes he can have my time. I'd rather he have my time than no time at all.\\" Grant describes the remarks that got him fired from WOR in a 2011 column: After being fired from WOR, Grant worked at WWDB 96.5 FM in Philadelphia for a year. Grant stated in his book, Let’s be Heard, \\"They actually ran me out of town. After a few months and no offers, I reluctantly agreed to take a job on a talk station in Philadelphia.\\" Grant returned to WMCA in June 1979 for a Saturday show from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. while still working in Philadelphia during the week. In April 1980, Grant returned to WMCA full-time, where he was teamed with another radio host named Janet Rose. Grant's producer was future conservative radio host Steve Malzberg. Mark Simone also worked for Grant as an intern during this time. = WABC (1984–1996) = In November 1984, WABC (AM) in New York City hired Grant to join their new talk station. He first hosted a show from 9–11 p.m., before moving to the 3–6 p.m. afternoon time slot. The Bob Grant Show consistently dominated the ratings in the highly competitive afternoon drive time slot in New York City and at one point the radio station aired recorded promos announcing him as \\"America's most listened to talk radio personality.\\" The gravel-voiced Grant reminded listeners during the daily introduction that the \\"program was unscripted and unrehearsed\\". On September 15, 1991, a roast honoring Grant for twenty one years of radio in New York City was held in West Orange, New Jersey. Freddie Roman was the Master of Ceremonies, and Grant was roasted by New York Senator Al D'Amato, comedian Pat Cooper, Soupy Sales, Rush Limbaugh, comedian Joe Piscopo and Lynn Samuels, among others. Grant introduced President George H. W. Bush to a crowd at Vets Field in Ridgewood, New Jersey while he campaigned for reelection on October 22, 1992. One of the most popular eras of the Bob Grant Show was during the 1993 and 1994 New Jersey and New York elections. Grant helped Rudy Giuliani win in 1993 against David Dinkins, and was also campaigning for Christine Todd Whitman by doing daily rants against New Jersey Governor James Florio calling him \\"flim-flam Florio.\\" Florio stated at the time, \\"how can I win with Bob Grant beating my brains out every day?\\" Grant's afternoon show grew more popular and reached a 7.1 in the ratings. During this time New York Magazine had requested to profile Grant and ask him about controversial remarks he had made. Grant was also asked to be photographed with a WABC banner draped over him and his finger pointing in the air. However, when the issue was released it showed Grant on the cover with the WABC banner covering him resembling a klansman with the words \\"Why he hates blacks\\" written across the page.\\" WABC program director John Mainelli would later reveal that he believed Mario Cuomo and Frank Lautenberg were behind this as Cuomo once had cornered Mainelli threatening to reveal dark secrets about Grant to ABC Chairman Thomas Murphy. Lautenberg attacked his Republican opponent Chuck Haytaian on his association with Grant in the campaign. Lautenberg caused Amtrak to stop advertising on Grant's radio show. Christy Whitman, who Grant had helped become governor stated that she would no longer appear on Grant's show. For the 1994 Election, Grant did daily rants against New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg calling him \\"Lousenberg\\", and New York Governor Mario Cuomo, who he was now calling \\"the sfaccim.\\" Grant had been friends with Cuomo beginning in the seventies, but they had a falling out during an appearance in 1986 on Grant's show. Grant questioned Cuomo on why he needed a large war chest against an opponent who didn't have much money, and Cuomo hung up on Grant. In 1994, the \\"Mario Salute\\" became a staple of Grant's show. Listeners would call in and state, \\"Mario, assenza me! Tu sei un proprio sfaccim.\\" Grant explained the translation in English was, \\"Mario, listen to me. You're a real lowlife.\\" T-shirts and bumper stickers were created with anti-Cuomo messages. A listener also made an anti-Mario Cuomo song which Grant would frequently play. Grant campaigned for Cuomo's opponent, George Pataki and had him on as a guest many times allegedly leading to Pataki picking up enough votes to defeat Cuomo. Grant's long stay at WABC ended when he was fired for a remark about the April 3, 1996 airplane crash involving Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. Grant remarked to caller named, Carl of Oyster Bay (Carl Limbacher, later of NewsMax fame), \\"My hunch is that [Brown] is the one survivor. I just have that hunch. Maybe it's because, at heart, I'm a pessimist.\\" When Brown was found dead, Grant's comments were widely criticized, and several weeks later, after a media campaign, his contract was terminated.The New York Times, April 18, 1996, Bob Grant Is Off Air Following Remarks On Brown's Death Grant's last show on WABC was on April 16, 1996, where he broadcast from the Reo Diner. He was fired the next day on April 17 by program director Phil Boyce after Grant had held an autograph-signing session for his book \\"Let's be Heard\\". Politicians who Grant had assisted, such as Christine Todd Whitman, Rudy Giuliani would never appear on Grant's radio show again, and George Pataki appeared one more time on Grant's last WOR show in January 2006. = Return to WOR (1996–2006) = After being fired, Grant moved down the dial to WOR to host his show in the same afternoon drive-time slot on April 29, 1996. Grant's age began to show while broadcasting at WOR. He was less engaging with the callers, and not as energetic during his broadcasts. For a time, the Bob Grant show went into national syndication, but has been a local only show since 2001. Grant and his WABC replacement Sean Hannity would sometimes throw jabs at each other. Hannity defeated Grant in the ratings from 2001 to 2006. Grant's WOR run ended on January 13, 2006. Grant's ratings were not to blame for his departure, according to the New York Post, which mentioned that the decision was reached because the station's other shows had niche audiences to garner more advertising dollars. On January 16, 2006, shortly after Grant's last WOR show, Grant appeared on Sean Hannity's radio show and TV program Hannity & Colmes, where his former competitor paid tribute to him. Having left his options open for \\"an offer he cannot refuse,\\" Grant returned to WOR in February 2006, doing one minute \\"Straight Ahead\\" commentaries which aired twice daily after news broadcasts until September 2006. On September 8, 2006 Grant again appeared on Hannity's show to provide a post-retirement update, which led to premature rumors that Grant was returning to WABC. Grant then made various isolated radio appearances. He appeared as a guest host on WFNY (now WNYL) on December 7, 2006, and was interviewed by attorney Anthony Macri for Macri's WOR show on February 24, 2007. = Possible foray into politics = In 2000 Grant briefly considered running for United States Senate from New Jersey as an Independent. He went as far as creating a Draft Bob Grant Committee, but ultimately decided against entering the race. He also considered running for Mayor of New York City in the 1970s. = Post-Retirement: Return to WABC and Internet broadcasting = His guest appearances became more frequent beginning in July 2007. On July 6, 2007, he guest hosted for John R. Gambling, and appeared on Mark Levin's show (which is networked from WABC) on July 10. Grant, guest hosted for Jerry Agar on July 9, 10, 11 and re-appeared as a fill-in host again for John Gambling on August 20 and 21. Then, on August 22, while appearing on Hannity's show, he announced that he was returning as a regular host to WABC, in the 8–10 p.m. slot that at the time was filled by Agar. It would later be revealed, on what was Agar's final show a few hours later, that he would be starting effective immediately, as Grant took over the final segments of the show. His first full show on ABC since 1996 was on August 23. The story of Grant's return, as reported by the New York Daily News, had been discovered only a couple of hours before Grant's official announcement. Grant's stint lasted less than a year and a half, until his regular nightly show was pulled by WABC in late November 2008 as part of a programming shuffle stemming from the debut of Curtis Sliwa's national show, and later Mark Levin's show expanding to three hours, leaving no room for Grant. Grant did his most recent AM radio work as guest host filling in for Michael Savage on January 21, 2009, Mark Levin on March 23, 2009, and Sean Hannity on July 31, 2009. During the week of July 6, 2009 Grant began hosting an Internet radio show titled Straight Ahead! which originally ran Monday through Friday from 8 to 9 a.m. ET on UBATV.com. As a webcast, the show differed from Grant's radio shows, in that the viewer watched Grant as he did his broadcast. The first two months of Straight Ahead! were from inside Grant's home, and were run with technical assistance from independent filmmaker Ryan O'Leary. New York radio personalities Richard Bey and Jay Diamond were also brought on board to broadcast their own one-hour shows. Grant mentioned that he did not get paid to do the UBATV show, but believes that Internet broadcasting is the future. Beginning in September 2009, Grant reduced Straight Ahead! from five days a week down to two (Mondays and Wednesdays from 10 to 11a.m. Eastern time). Grant also moved the show from his home to a professional studio. Due to a low number of callers to the show, Grant usually interviewed only guests for the hour. On January 13, 2010, Grant did his last UBATV show. Grant's last UBATV show and his last WOR show both fell on the date of January 13. On September 13, 2009, Grant returned to WABC for a third stint at the station, doing a weekly Sunday talk show from noon to 2 p.m. Grant's return to AM broadcasting allowed him to continue interacting with his fan base through greater listenership and participation than his previous internet radio show provided. At the close of his first show, he expressly thanked the management of the station for \\"inviting him back\\" and said he looked forward to continuing this joint venture every week for the foreseeable future. Grant issued a statement in October 2012 that his October 7 broadcast would be his last, but then rescinded that message after the show, labeling it a \\"mistake\\" and an attempt to grab attention. He then took off a short time for medical work, and when he returned to the air, it was for a shortened 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. Sunday show. Grant's show continued in its one-hour weekly format until July 28, 2013 when he permanently retired due to declining health. Grant also prepared weekly columns for his website, BobGrantOnline.com. The site was originally sponsored by NewsMax. The editorials ended February 19, 2013, again due to health issues.  Characteristics of Grant's radio shows  Socio-political views = Grant was widely considered a political conservative. In later life, he commented that \\"I certainly had many beliefs you'd call conservative, but on some social issues, like abortion or gay marriage, I was more what you'd call libertarian.\\" In 1995, the progressive media watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting accused Grant of racism and homophobia. As evidence, they highlighted his repeated use of the word \\"savages\\" when referring to African- Americans and statements such as \\"minorities are the Big Apple's majority, you don't need the papers to tell you that, walk around and you know it. To me, that's a bad thing. I'm a white person\\". They highlighted his description of Haitian refugees as \\"swine\\" and \\"sub-human infiltrators\\" who multiply \\"like maggots on a hot day\\" and his comment that \\"Ideally, it would have been nice to have a few phalanxes of policemen with machine guns and mow [gay pride paraders] down\\". Grant was highly critical of U.S. President Barack Obama, asserting his view that Obama \\"truly believes in socialism ... which has the same effect as communism.\\" Grant distinguished himself from other conservative talk show hosts by calling for Obama to release his long form birth certificate, prior to Obama releasing it. He described the Tea Party movement as continuing \\"the finest tradition of Americanism\\". Although Grant was generally known as being a conservative, he was a critic of hard-line conservative advocates in primary races, including the Tea Party movement's candidates. This was a frequent debate topic between Grant and his callers over the past few years. During the fall election of 2010, Grant criticized candidates, such as Christine O'Donnell, Rand Paul, and Sharron Angle. Grant endorsed Charlie Crist over Marco Rubio on a July 10, 2010 broadcast for the Florida senate primary. On a May 8, 2011 broadcast, Grant informed his audience that he supported the moderate Jon Huntsman, Jr. for the Republican nomination for president, although he would later go on to support Mitt Romney. = Fill-in hosts = Grant was in favor of engaging hosts substituting for him while he was away on vacation to maintain his ratings. In the cases of G. Gordon Liddy and Curtis Sliwa who guest hosted along with his wife Lisa Evers, this led to them being hired for their own shows. Other popular fill-ins included Bill O'Reilly during the 1990s, Roger Ailes, Alan Burke, Joe Scarborough, Tom Marr, Ann Coulter in 2002, Tom Snyder in 2002, Mike Gallagher, Barry Farber, and comedians Jackie Mason and Pat Cooper in the early 1990s.  Influences and legacy  Being largely the innovator of his own particular talk radio style, Grant previously worked with the likes of Barry Gray (radio) and Joe Pyne. Pyne would often end each broadcast with \\"Straight Ahead\\" which is something Grant picked up, leading many to believe that Grant was the first host to frequently use that line. Over the years, national radio talk personality Howard Stern has made differing remarks on his admiration for Grant as an early influence. Upon Stern's arrival in New York, he cited Grant as an influence, but as Stern's stardom rose, Grant became the subject of occasional ridicule on Stern's show. During Stern's prime, he denied being influenced by Grant or having respect for him. Stern also criticized Grant for changing his act to appease management. Grant told Paul D. Colford, author of the 1996 Stern biography, Howard Stern: King of All Media, about being approached at a public appearance by Ben Stern, Howard's father, with a teenage Howard in tow. Father introduced son to Grant and told him of Howard's desire to go into radio. \\"I looked at this big, gawky kid and I said to him, 'Just be yourself,'\\" Grant recalled. Stern has denied Grant's version of the story. Soon after Grant's firing from WABC, and before his first WOR show, Grant appeared as a call-in guest on Stern's radio show. In more recent years, Stern has praised Grant's legacy. In 2006, Stern called in to Grant's final WOR broadcast and lauded him on the air. On his January 6, 2014 Sirius/XM broadcast, while discussing Grant's death and career for the first half-hour of his show, Stern said, \\"I consider him to be the best broadcaster I've ever heard.\\" Stern said, \\"Bob was just this really well- informed conservative, who would often become liberal on social issues, but he had such a flair ... he was such a broadcaster ... he could hold your attention for hours,\\" before concluding, \\"Goodbye, Bob, you are the greatest broadcaster that has ever lived\\".Howard Stern Show, Sirius Radio, January 6, 2014 broadcast Glenn Beck now uses the catchphrase \\"Get off my phone!\\" as a spinoff of Grant's earlier call-in talk show style, as do Tom Scharpling and Mark Levin; similarly, Sean Hannity often uses Grant's phrase \\"Straight ahead.\\" Rush Limbaugh early on acknowledged that Bob Grant paved the way for his success nationwide. In 2002, industry magazine Talkers ranked Grant as the 16th greatest radio talk show host of all time. On March 28, 2007 Bob Grant was nominated for induction into the National Radio Hall of Fame. Radio & Records had planned to issue a Lifetime Achievement Award to Grant during its annual convention in March 2008; however, the nomination was revoked in January 2008 for \\"past comments by him that contradict our values and the respect we have for all members of our community.\\"Rowland, Kara. Talk radio award revoked. The Washington Times. January 17, 2008. Several talk radio hosts have spoken out against the decision; Neal Boortz has stated: Sean Hannity, Opie and Anthony, comedian Jim Norton, Lars Larson, Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin, Lionel and Howard Stern opposed the move as well, with Levin stating \\"I am disgusted with the mistreatment of Bob Grant. I am fed up with the censors, intimidators, and cowards in this business.\\" Don Imus deemed the award unimportant, offered to return awards he had received after treating them to his sledgehammer and block of wood, and called Grant's comments \\"stupid\\", although he also referred to Grant as a \\"legendary broadcaster.\\"Imus, Don. Imus in the Morning. January 19, 2008. Partial reaction here . Tributes to Bob Grant poured in after his death was announced. Marc Fisher, Senior Editor at The Washington Post, wrote tribute to Grant on his Facebook page, saying that his \\"most creative and influential period\\" was from the 1960s \\"when he captured and reflected the rage of New Yorkers seeing their city change around them, to the 70s, when he almost singlehandedly kept Libya's Qaddafi on the U.S. political radar and became one of New York's most popular figures.\\" A resident of the New Jersey communities of Woodbridge Township, Manalapan Township and Toms River, Grant died Hillsborough Township, New Jersey on December 31, 2013, after what was described as a \\"short illness\\".Griffith, Janelle. \\"Bob Grant, father of conservative talk radio, dead at 84\\", The Star-Ledger, January 2, 2014.

The definition of what was required varied, but involved torture or cruelty to animals or humans and sometimes included animal sacrifice. The Scottish writer Màrtainn MacGille Mhàrtainn describes three different ways of consulting spirits common in the Scottish Hebrides in the 17th century. All involved acts which were supposed to summon spirits or demons in the form of animals which would answer questions concerning the future. In one version of the taghairm said to be one of the most effective means of raising the devil, and getting unlawful wishes gratified, the ritual included roasting cats alive, one after the other, for several days without tasting food. This supposedly summoned a legion of devils in the guise of black cats, with their master at their head, all screeching in a terrifying way. Scottish historical novelist Sir Walter Scott scornfully described the last method in a footnote to his influential poem Lady of the Lake. He further adds that it could involve another situation \\"where the scenery around him suggested nothing but objects of horror.\\" However, Scott could not speak Scottish Gaelic and his concepts of Gaelic culture were sometimes distorted. Other variations practiced have been recorded, and the same name has also been applied to other ritual customs. One variation of the ritual was said to summon a demonic cat called Big Ears, who would grant the summoners answers to their questions and fulfill their wishes. The last ceremony of this kind is said to have been performed on the island of Mull in the beginning of the seventeenth century, and was recorded in the London Literary Gazette of March 1824.Briggs, Katharine (1976). An Encyclopedia of Fairies. Pantheon Books. pp. 23 (\\"Big Ears\\"), 388-9 (\\"Taghairm\\"). .The London Literary Gazette March 1824, p. 172.

Early life and education French was born in Brooklyn to E. Charles Edwards, an engineer, and Isabel Hazz Edwards, a department store clerk. In her youth, she was a journalist, writing a neighborhood newsletter. She played the piano and dreamed of becoming a composer. She received a bachelor's degree from Hofstra University (then Hofstra College) in 1951, in philosophy and English literature. Marilyn Edwards married Robert M. French Jr. in 1950 and supported him while he attended law school. The couple had two children. French also received a master's degree in English from Hofstra, in 1964. She divorced Robert French in 1967 and then pursued a doctorate at Harvard University, where she earned a Ph.D in 1972. CareerTeaching= She was an English instructor at Hofstra, from 1964 to 1968, and was an assistant professor of English at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, from 1972 to 1976. =Political views and written works= French's first serious publication, The Book as World: James Joyce's Ulysses, was her Harvard thesis. In her work, French asserted that women's oppression is an intrinsic part of the male- dominated global culture. For instance, one of her first non-fiction works, Beyond Power: On Women, Men and Morals (1985), is a historical examination of the effects of patriarchy on the world. French took issue with the expectations of married women in the post-World War II era and became a leading, if controversial, opinion maker on gender issues who decried the patriarchal society she saw around her. \\"My goal in life is to change the entire social and economic structure of Western civilization, to make it a feminist world,\\" she once declared. French's first and best-known novel, The Women's Room (1977), follows the lives of Mira and her friends in 1950s and 1960s America, including Val, a militant radical feminist. The novel portrays the details of the lives of women at this time and the feminist movement of this era in the United States. At one point in the book the character Val says, \\"all men are rapists, and that's all they are. They rape us with their eyes, their laws, and their codes.\\" The Women's Room sold more than 20 million copies and was translated into 20 languages. Gloria Steinem, a close friend, compared the impact of the book on the discussion surrounding women's rights to the one that Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man (1952) had had on racial equality 25 years earlier. Her most significant work in later life was From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women. It was published in a Dutch translation in 1995 (in one volume of 1312 pages), but did not appear in English until 2002 and 2003 (published in three volumes by Mcarthur & Company), and then again in English in four volumes (published by The Feminist Press) in 2008. It is built around the premise that exclusion from the prevailing intellectual histories denied women their past, present and future. Despite carefully chronicling a long history of oppression, the last volume ends on an optimistic note, said Florence Howe, who recently retired as director of the publishing house. \\"For the first time women have history,\\" she said of Ms. French's work. \\"The world changed and she helped change it.\\" While French was pleased by significant gains made by women in the three decades since her landmark novel, The Women's Room, she was also just as quick to point out lingering deficiencies in gender equality. Personal life, health, and death She married Robert M. French Jr., in 1950. They had two children. The couple divorced in 1967. French was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in 1992. This experience was the basis for her book A Season in Hell: A Memoir (1998). She survived cancer and later died from heart failure at age 79, on May 2, 2009, in Manhattan.

Content \\"The pontificate of Leo marked a change in how popes exercised their teaching authority. With Leo, the popes begin to offer theological treatments on important topics. It also saw a beginning the Church's participation in ecumenism. The encyclical is an invitation to those who are without the Church to return to it. It is an affirmation of the Church's unity, and the role of the Magisterium in preserving that unity, through the threefold responsibilities of sanctifying, governing and teaching. The document contains an extensive articulation of and apologia for Catholic ecclesiology as it relates to the Church's unity, one of the four marks of the Church according to the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, which professes belief in \\"one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.\\" The purpose was to indicate Leo's desire for unity and his interest in Catholic Ecumenism. In the second half of the text, Pope Leo strongly defends the primacy of the Roman Pontiff as taught at the First Vatican Council as a corollary of the Church's unity, but notes {{Quote...He who made Peter the foundation of the Church also \\"chose, twelve, whom He called apostles\\" (Luke vi., 13); and just as it is necessary that the authority of Peter should be perpetuated in the Roman Pontiff, so, by the fact that the bishops succeed the Apostles, they inherit their ordinary power, and thus the episcopal order necessarily belongs to the essential constitution of the Church. at paragraph 14.

Introduced in 1979, the range aimed to fill the gap between Duplo and the standard Lego product ranges. Aimed at both boys and girls, the range encouraged storytelling, and was the first theme to be extended into books, clothing, and a claymation TV series that aired in the UK and Canada during the 1980s as Edward and Friends. Each episode was five minutes in length.  Characters  Legoland, Denmark Fabuland sets featured anthropomorphic animal characters. These pieces were larger than standard Lego Minifigures, but smaller than Duplo figures, and included movable arms, legs and head. Some of the characters appeared in more than one set, and were given names, and sometimes even stories. Recurring characters included Edward Elephant, Bonnie Bunny, Max Mouse, Clive Crocodile, Walter (Wilfred) Walrus, Wally Walrus, Lucy Lamb, Lisa Lamb, Ricky Raccoon, Roger Raccoon, Freddy Fox, Bruno Bear, Bernard Bear, Billy Bear, Perry Panda, Patrick Panda, Bertie Bulldog, Boris Bulldog, Buster Bulldog, Barty Bulldog, Clarke Bulldog, Mike Monkey, Mark Monkey, Gabriel Gorilla (Chester Chimp), Paulette Poodle, Harry Horse, Henry Horse, Catherine Cat, Charlie Cat, Sandy Seagull, Lionel Lion, Legal Beagle, Hannah Hippopotamus, Joe Crow, Marjorie Mouse, Mortimer Mouse, Michael Mouse, Patricia Piglet, Patrick Pig, Percy Pig, Peter Pig, Hugo Hog, Billy Goat, Gertrude Goat, Clara Cow, Doctor Dog, Paul Parrot, Robby Rabbit, Bert Bear and Ernie Elephant. This was the first Lego theme which characters had names. In different countries names of the same characters were different. Style Fabuland had a distinctive friendly style with various animal characters that each had a job or purpose in the town of Fabuland. Fabuland featured special elements that were larger than standard Lego bricks, but were fully compatible with regular Lego. Fabuland used a primary colour scheme and the sets were aimed for children between 4-8 as a transition from Duplo to Lego. Fabuland was unique due to the special elements, such as walls, roof elements, tables, chairs, boats and cars chassis. Larger Sets included buildings with story book like instructions and the theme also had many vehicles and individual characters with accessories. Fabuland is highly sought after today among collectors and there is a large fan base that keeps the theme alive via Lego fan sites. Fabuland was discontinued in 1989 and since then many elements have reappeared in many themes. In 2000, Lego released the Mickey Mouse theme that contained many Fabuland elements.

Edward was a self-taught and self-professed demonologist, author, and lecturer. Lorraine professed to be clairvoyant and a light trance medium who worked closely with her husband. In 1952, the Warrens founded the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), the oldest ghost hunting group in New England. They authored many books about the paranormal and about their private investigations into various reports of paranormal activity. They claimed to have investigated well over 10,000 cases during their career. The Warrens were among the first investigators in the so-called Amityville haunting. According to the Warrens, the NESPR uses a variety of individuals, including medical doctors, researchers, police officers, nurses, college students, and members of the clergy in its investigations.Ed & Lorraine Warren - Home Stories of ghost hauntings popularized by the Warrens have been adapted as or have indirectly inspired dozens of films, television series and documentaries, including 17 films in the Amityville Horror series and seven films in The Conjuring Universe. Skeptics Perry DeAngelis and Steven Novella have investigated the Warrens' evidence and described it as \\"blarney\\". Skeptical investigators Joe Nickell and Benjamin Radford concluded that the better known hauntings, Amityville and the Snedeker family haunting, did not happen and had been invented. Notable investigationsAnnabelle= According to the Warrens, in the year 1970, two roommates claimed their Raggedy Ann doll was possessed by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. The Warrens took the doll, telling the roommates it was \\"being manipulated by an inhuman presence\\", and put it on display at the family's \\"Occult Museum\\". The legend of the doll inspired several films in the Conjuring Universe and is a recurring leitmotif in many others. =Amityville= The Warrens are probably best known for their involvement in the 1975 Amityville Horror in which New York couple George and Kathy Lutz claimed that their house was haunted by a violent, demonic presence so intense that it eventually drove them out of their home. The Amityville Horror Conspiracy authors Stephen and Roxanne Kaplan characterized the case as a \\"hoax\\". Lorraine Warren told a reporter for The Express-Times newspaper that the Amityville Horror was not a hoax. The reported haunting was the basis for the 1977 book The Amityville Horror and adapted into the 1979 and 2005 films of the same name, while also serving as inspiration for the film series that followed. The Warrens' version of events is partially adapted and portrayed in the opening sequence of The Conjuring 2 (2016). According to Benjamin Radford, the story was \\"refuted by eyewitnesses, investigations and forensic evidence\\". In 1979, lawyer William Weber stated that he, Jay Anson, and the occupants \\"invented\\" the horror story \\"over many bottles of wine\\". =Enfield poltergeist= In 1977, the Warrens investigated claims that a family in the North London suburb of Enfield was haunted by poltergeist activity. While a number of independent observers dismissed the incident as a hoax carried out by \\"attention-hungry\\" children, the Warrens were convinced that it was a case of \\"demonic possession\\". The story was the inspiration for The Conjuring 2, although critics say the Warrens were involved \\"to a far lesser degree than portrayed in the movie\\" and in fact had shown up to the scene uninvited and been refused admittance to the home.Conjuring 2 vs the True Story of the Enfield Haunting Historyvshollywood.com =Cheyenne Johnson= In 1981, Arne Cheyenne Johnson was accused of killing his landlord, Alan Bono. Ed and Lorraine Warren had been called prior to the killing to deal with the alleged demonic possession of the younger brother of Johnson's fiancée. The Warrens subsequently claimed that Johnson was also possessed. At trial, Johnson attempted to plead Not Guilty by Reason of Demonic Possession, but was unsuccessful with his plea. This story serves as the inspiration for The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021). The case was described in the 1983 book The Devil in Connecticut by Gerald Brittle. =Snedeker house= In 1986, Ed and Lorraine Warren arrived and proclaimed the Snedeker house, a former funeral home, to be infested with demons. The case was featured in the 1993 book In a Dark Place: The Story of a True Haunting. A TV film that later became part of the Discovery Channel series A Haunting was produced in 2002. The Haunting in Connecticut, a film very loosely based on the Warrens' version of events and directed by Peter Cornwell, was released in 2009. Horror author Ray Garton, who wrote an account of the alleged haunting of the Snedeker family in Southington, Connecticut, later called into question the veracity of the accounts contained in his book, saying: \\"The family involved, which was going through some serious problems like alcoholism and drug addiction, could not keep their story straight, and I became very frustrated; it's hard writing a non-fiction book when all the people involved are telling you different stories\\". To paranormal investigator Benjamin Radford, Garton said of Lorraine \\"'if she told me the sun would come up tomorrow morning, I'd get a second opinion'\\". =Smurl family= Pennsylvania residents Jack and Janet Smurl reported their home was disturbed by numerous supernatural phenomena, including sounds, smells and apparitions. The Warrens became involved and claimed that the Smurl home was occupied by four spirits and also a demon that allegedly sexually assaulted Jack and Janet. The Smurls' version of their story was the subject of a 1986 paperback titled The Haunted and television film of the same name directed by Robert Mandel. =Union Cemetery= Ed Warren's book Graveyard: True Hauntings from an Old New England Cemetery (St Martins Press, 1992) features a \\"White Lady\\" ghost which haunts Union Cemetery. He claimed to have “captured her essence” on film. Other activities The Warrens were responsible for training several self-described demonologists, including Dave Considine and their nephew John Zaffis. Personal life Ed and Lorraine Warren were members of the Roman Catholic Church. The Warrens held that demonic forces are likely to possess those who lack faith. Criticism According to a 1997 interview with the Connecticut Post, Steve Novella and Perry DeAngelis investigated the Warrens for the New England Skeptical Society (NESS). They found the couple to be pleasant people, but their claims of demons and ghosts to be \\"at best, as tellers of meaningless ghost stories, and at worst, dangerous frauds.\\" They took the $13 tour and looked at all the evidence the Warrens had for spirits and ghosts. They watched the videos and looked at the best evidence the Warrens had. \\"Their conclusion: It's all blarney.\\" They found common errors with flash photography and nothing evil in the artifacts the Warrens had collected. \\"They have... a ton of fish stories about evidence that got away... They're not doing good scientific investigation; they have a predetermined conclusion which they adhere to, literally and religiously,\\" according to Novella. Lorraine Warren said that the problem with Perry and Steve \\"is they don't base anything on a God\\". Novella responded, \\"It takes work to do solid, critical thinking, to actually employ your intellectual faculties and come to a conclusion that actually reflects reality ... That's what scientists do every day, and that's what skeptics advocate\\". In an article for The Sydney Morning Herald that examined whether supernatural films are really based on true events, that investigation was used as evidence to the contrary. As Novella is quoted, \\"They [the Warrens] claim to have scientific evidence which does indeed prove the existence of ghosts, which sounds like a testable claim into which we can sink our investigative teeth. What we found was a very nice couple, some genuinely sincere people, but absolutely no compelling evidence...\\" While it was made clear that neither DeAngelis nor Novella thought the Warrens would intentionally cause harm to anyone, they did caution that claims like the Warrens' served to reinforce delusions and confuse the public about legitimate scientific methodology. Judith alleged affair On December 13, 2017, Judith Penney revealed that she had an underaged, amorous love affair with Ed starting when she was 15 and he was in his mid-30's with Lorraine's knowledge. Penney claimed that Ed called her \\"the love of his life\\" multiple times and that she was pregnant with Ed's child only to get an abortion in 1973. Penney also admitted in a sworn declaration that Ed was abusive to Lorraine stating that, \\"Sometimes Ed would actually have to slap her across the face to shut her up,\\" and \\"Some nights I thought they were going to kill each other.\\"  Occult Museum  In addition to investigations, Lorraine ran The Warrens' Occult Museum (now closed) in the back of her house in Monroe, Connecticut with the help of her son-in-law, Tony Spera. The museum displays many claimed haunted objects and artifacts from around the world. Many of the artifacts from their most famous investigations are featured.

Ed and Lorraine Warren originally visited the house after the Lutz family fled the house after 28 days of occupancy. Film adaptations In 1991, a two-hour made-for-TV film based on the Smurl haunting, titled The Haunted, was released by 20th Century Fox. Written by Robert Curran, Jack Smurl, Janet Smurl, Ed Warren and Lorraine Warren, the film starred Jeffrey DeMunn as Jack Smurl and Sally Kirkland as Janet Smurl. The 2009 film The Haunting in Connecticut was loosely based on the 1986 Snedeker haunting investigated by the Warrens. =The Conjuring Universe= The Warrens' case files serve as the basis for The Conjuring Universe series of horror films. The 2013 film The Conjuring, directed by James Wan, spotlights a Warren case, and stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren. Its 2014 follow-up, Annabelle, a supernatural psychological horror film directed by John R. Leonetti, is both a prequel to and spin-off of The Conjuring, and was inspired by a story of the Annabelle doll. It stars Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton, and Alfre Woodard. The Conjuring universe's next film was 2016's The Conjuring 2, a sequel to The Conjuring, directed by Wan, and with Farmiga and Wilson reprising their roles as Lorraine and Ed, respectively. It is based on the Enfield Poltergeist case. 2017 saw the release of another prequel, Annabelle: Creation, telling the origin story of the Annabelle doll. Farmiga and Wilson briefly appeared as Ed and Lorraine in the 2018 spin-off film The Nun, focusing on the character of Valak in its \\"Demon Nun\\" form who was the villain from The Conjuring 2. The two reprised their roles again in Annabelle Comes Home, the sequel to Annabelle, and are set to return for The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It.

Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center is a non-profit organization in Buffalo, New York, that shows the work of artists of diverse backgrounds in film, video, literature, music, performance, media and visual arts. The institution offers the public programs and exhibitions that focus on such themes as gender, race, popular culture, consumerism, and sexual identity. The ideology behind Hallwalls has always been one of a cooperative of artists. Programs have included artists in different mediums, who work together to present exhibitions that touch on similar themes. Past examples include the collaboration between the performance artists Gary Nickard and Reinhard Reitzenstein with the Buffalo- based post-punk band The Vores in Monsters of Nature Design; representations of the John F. Kennedy assassination by Ant Farm and T.R. Uthco’s 1975 film The Eternal Frame with the photographer, sculptor, painter and video artist Eric M. Jensen in Parallax Views; the 2008 exhibition series The Imaginary Line featuring the Mexican performance artist Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Ursula Biemann, Jim Finn; and a commemoration of the 30th anniversary of Love Canal by Fereshteh Toosi. The biennial festival Ways In Being Gay: Ways in Between Gender started in 1988 by the then Hallwalls performance curator Ron Ehmke, celebrated its 20th year in 2008. The year-long celebration began with Derek Jarman’s final film Blue. The annual literary festival, Babel, which Hallwalls co-sponsors, featured a reading by Michael Ondaatje, the winner of the 1992 Man Booker Prize for The English Patient, in 2008. Hallwalls also collaborates with other non-profit organizations in Western New York. Since 1986, ARTGREASE, both Hallwalls' and Squeaky Wheel's shared timeslot on Buffalo Public-access television cable TV, Channel 20, has given the institution a chance to serve the community with its half-hour television program, Artwaves. Hallwalls also co-sponsors, along with organizations Just Buffalo Literary Center, Gay & Lesbian Youth Services of WNY, and Compass House, Spotlight on Youth, an open-mic poetry program dedicated to young poets and artists in Buffalo.The Buffalo News \\"Spotlight on Youth: Teens offer poetry, music and more at open mic.\\" Binder, Galia.

The gallery has also made it a mission to show work that directly shows Buffalo’s fading industrial past, with exhibitions such as Jesse Webber’s You Can’t Smoke in Here, Mr. Corbusier, You’ll Burn This Mother Down, featuring silkscreen prints of photographs of several grain elevators taken by Herd and Hilla Becher, who are husband and wife.The Buffalo News \\"Hallwalls exhibits focus on ravages of decay, the distance between us.\\" Dabkowski,Colin. November 21, 2008 History Hallwalls was established by Charles Clough, Robert Longo, Diane Bertolo, Nancy Dwyer, Larry Lundy, Cindy Sherman and Michael Zwack in 1974 in a converted ice packing warehouse, the Essex Art Center, which had been converted into studios for artists. The focus of Hallwalls since its inception has been to produce a space that will accommodate artists from diverse backgrounds. Works from varying mediums, which include film, video, performance art, music, painting, photography, and sculpture, have come together since the beginning, to confront the prevailing social issues of contemporary culture. In the 1980s, Hallwalls moved to 700 Main Street. During this time, the curators found it increasingly difficult to counterbalance the initial intentions of the founders, which were to create a space where artists could freely show works that were not creations sponsored or funded by corporate interests, and grow as an arts institution that could serve the largest possible audience. Funding increases allowed for a larger gallery space in the 700 Main Street complex, as well as opportunities for more artists to show their work in the gallery, but required the input and compensation of more staff and organizers. Funding has been a consistent issue, but Hallwalls has been able to survive. Despite severe cuts in the 1990s, Hallwalls has remained a strong presence in the Western New York community. In January 2006, Hallwalls moved into its new home, which it shares with Righteous Babe Records, at 341 Delaware Ave., in a former Asbury Methodist Church, purchased by Ani DiFranco.Consider The Alternatives: 20 Years of Contemporary Art At Hallwalls.

The term \\"preparatory school\\" is used as it prepares the children for the Common Entrance Examination in order to secure a place at an independent secondary school, typically one of the English public schools. They are also preferred by parents in the hope of getting their child into a state selective grammar school. Most prep schools are inspected by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI), which is overseen by Ofsted on behalf of the Department for Education. Overview Boys' prep schools are generally for 8-13 year-olds, who are prepared for the Common Entrance Examination, the key to entry into many secondary independent schools. Before the age of seven or eight, the term \\"pre-prep school\\" is used. Girls' independent schools in England tend to follow the age ranges of state schools more closely than those of boys. Girls' preparatory schools usually admit girls from the age of four, who will then continue to another independent school at 11, or at 13 if the school is co-educational (as most secondary schools now are). However, as more girls now go on to formerly single-sex boys' schools that have become co- educational, the separation is less clear. There are 130,000 pupils in over 500 prep schools of all types and sizes. Prep schools may be for boys or girls only, or may be co-educational. They may be day schools, boarding schools, weekly boarding, flexi-boarding, or a combination. They fall into the following general categories: * Wholly independent prep schools, both charitable and proprietary * Junior schools linked to senior schools (ie primary to secondary) * Choir schools, which educate child choristers of cathedrals, university colleges, and some other large religious institutions; they all accept non-chorister pupils with the exception of Westminster Abbey Choir School; these schools are usually affiliated to Anglican churches, but may occasionally be associated with the Catholic church such as Westminster Cathedral * Schools offering special educational provision or facilities * Schools with particular religious affiliations The Independent Association of Preparatory Schools (IAPS) is a prep schools heads association; one of seven affiliated associations of the Independent Schools Council. Pre-prep Pre- prep schools are generally associated with prep schools, and take children from reception i.e. five years of age. Provision for younger children is generally called a nursery school or kindergarten. History Prep schools were originally developed in England and Wales in the early 19th century as boarding schools to prepare boys for leading public schools, such as Eton, Charterhouse, Westminster, and Winchester. The numbers attending such schools increased due to large numbers of parents being overseas in the service of the British Empire. They are now found in all parts of the United Kingdom, and elsewhere.

The famous toy store in New York City, FAO Schwarz, was founded under the name Schwarz Toy Bazaar. It was founded in 1862 by the German immigrant, Frederick August Otto Schwarz. The former largest toy retailer in the United States, Toys “R” Us, started business in 1948 by Charles Lazarus, a veteran of World War II. In 2015, FAO Schwarz closed, and did not reopen until after Toys “R” Us went bankrupt in 2018.  Economics  Today, toy stores face competition from the online toy market. As a result, many large toy retailers have been rendered bankrupt. These competing websites include Amazon or eBay. Toys “R” Us cut prices in an attempt to compete, but it ultimately ended in failure. As Jeff P. Bezos explained, \\"For a toy store to survive, they've got to create the kind of fun that Amazon can't.\\" Toy Stores that adopt this model by increasing in-store interactivity have been more successful in maintaining business. Another model many stores have adopted is an online alternative, specifically for the individual retailer.  Controversies  There can be a large gender bias for the marketing of certain products. This includes using color to market products to a certain gender, or only showing one gender to market to that specific demographic. On the U.S. Disney Store website, the toys for boys are predominantly red, black, brown, or grey, while the toys for girls are mostly pink or purple. However, the toys meant for both boys and girls were mostly of the same color palette as the toys for boys.

After he witnesses an attack on an ice cream van by angry competitors, he is led into the struggle between two Italian families over the ice cream market of Glasgow.Comfort and Joy at the British Film Institute. The film received a BAFTA Award Nomination for Best Original Screenplay in 1985.. Plot A few days before Christmas, Glasgow radio disc jockey Allan \\"Dicky\\" Bird is stunned when Maddy (Eleanor David), his kleptomaniac girlfriend of four years, suddenly announces that she is moving out. His doctor friend Colin (Patrick Malahide) tries to console him, but Bird is heartbroken. One day, he goes for a drive to take his mind off his troubles. Noticing an attractive girl, Charlotte (Clare Grogan), in the back of a \\"Mr. Bunny\\" ice cream van, he follows it under a railway bridge on a whim and when the van stops, purchases an ice cream cone. (As in Alice in Wonderland, the protagonist has followed a rabbit through a tunnel, with sometimes bizarre consequences.) To his amazement, three men drive up and proceed to smash up the van with baseball bats. The occupants retaliate with squirts of raspberry sauce. By sheer chance, Bird finds himself involved in a turf war between rival Italian ice cream vendors: the young interloper Trevor (Alex Norton) and the older, more established \\"Mr. McCool\\" (Roberto Bernardi). As an admired local celebrity, Bird meets with McCool and his sons Bruno, Paolo, and Renato. He then goes back and forth between them and Trevor and Charlotte (later revealed to be McCool's rebellious daughter), trying to negotiate a peaceful settlement. Various misadventures follow, with his red BMW 323i Baur convertible suffering more and more damage each time. Bird becomes obsessed with resolving the war. To contact the combatants, he starts broadcasting coded messages on his early morning show, causing Hilary (Rikki Fulton), his boss, to ask his secretary if Mr. Bird's contract includes a \\"sanity clause\\". Hilary then orders Bird to see a psychiatrist about the Mr. Bunny he keeps trying to reach. In the end, Bird proposes that the rival entrepreneurs, who turn out to be uncle and nephew, join forces to market a new treat: ice cream fritters. Both sides are impressed by the product's potential. It appeals both to Trevor's fish and chips frying background as well as Mr. McCool's ice cream expertise. Since Bird alone knows the secret ingredient of the ancient Chinese recipe, he cuts himself in for 30% of the gross as well as repairs to his abused car. During the credits, he is heard trying to record a commercial for the new product: \\"Frosty Hots\\".

He said \\"When local stations like Radio Clyde started, it was the first time we had the phenomenon of the local celebrity, famous in a radius of 10 miles, who would open supermarkets in Drumchapel. It was new to Scotland and it was soulful, a guy in his little pod broadcasting to a city in the middle of the night. It gave people a sense of local identity when they heard people on the radio who talked like them.\\" Forsyth felt he did not have enough for a film, so he added a love story. He needed more, when Peter Capaldi, who came from an ice cream family, told him stories of the ice cream war. \\"But the way he was telling it, the rivalry was simply over who had the best ice cream,\\" said Forsyth. “The whole tenor of the film was fluffiness and silliness because that’s what local radio was,\\" said Forsyth. \\"While the real ice-cream wars in Glasgow were about territories for offloading drugs – they weren’t getting antsy about someone else’s ice cream tasting better – the film was a metaphor for the empty-headed niceness of local radio.” Forsyth was able to raise money to make the film on the basis of his success with Local Hero. \\"Local Hero created the impression that my films make money, because it got a lot of coverage and a fair amount of people went to see it. So, in that sense, it made it a bit easier for me to raise money for the next film.\\"BILL FOSYTH'S OFFBEAT CONTRIBUTIONS ENRICH THE WORLD OF LOW-BUDGET FILMS Reich, Howard.

The staff at Film4 agreed, calling it \\"... somehow not as satisfying as his [Forsyth's] early films.\\". The reviewer went on to observe that, \\"Paterson is always worth seeing, while Grogan and David are equally watchable, but there aren't the belly laughs That Sinking Feeling provides so readily, or the casual charm of Gregory's Girl.\\" The Variety magazine staff review was also lukewarm, concluding that after \\"... evincing much laughter over an unexpectedly funny couple living together, Forsyth abruptly switches into a more conventional plot\\" and that \\"David and Paterson are terrific together and almost every line between them is a joy. From the point she departs with no explanation the pic flashes a sparky moment or two, but it doesn't reach the high spots again.\\". On the other hand, Roger Ebert called Comfort and Joy \\"... one of the happiest and most engaging movies you are likely to see this year, and it comes from a Glasgow director who has made a specialty out of characters who are as real as you and me, and nicer than me.\\".

Content A movement for religious unity had been developing in liberal Protestant circles since the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Pope Leo XIII recognized this in his 1896 encyclical Satis cognitum in which he discoursed at some length on unity as a mark of the Catholic Church. In Mortalium animos, Pius restates traditional Catholic Doctrine, that the Church enjoys a visible organic unity, which, because it is divinely constituted is divinely protected.Bourne, Francis. True Religious Unity , Catholic Truth Society, No. Pe1928a (1933). Pius XI rejected the hope: > that the nations, although they differ among themselves in certain religious > matters, will without much difficulty come to agree as brethren in > professing certain doctrines, which form as it were a common basis of the > spiritual life. For which reason conventions, meetings and addresses are > frequently arranged by these persons...

Pius understood this idea that all religions are just varying (and fallible) human expressions of a natural religious impulse or instinct was one of the fundamental errors of that modernism which had been so recently condemned by Pope Pius X.Harrison, Brian W., \\"Is Ecumenism a Heresy?\\", Oriens, July 2008. He saw the current movement towards unity \\"as nothing else than a Federation, composed of various communities of Christians, even though they adhere to different doctrines, which may even be incompatible one with another.\\"Mortalium animos, §6. Pius stated that the Church does not permit Catholics to take part in the assemblies of non-Catholics.Mortalium animos, §10. \\"To act otherwise would, in her judgment, be disloyalty to her Founder and to the truth which He has given into her care.\\" Pius welcomed separated brethren, but stated what was and what was not possible regarding theological differences in dialogues with non-Catholics.Oliver, James M., Ecumenical Associations: Their Canonical Status with Particular Reference to the United States of America, Gregorian Biblical Book Shop, 1999, p. 34.

The nervous and endocrine systems often act together in a process called neuroendocrine integration, to regulate the physiological processes of the human body. Neuroendocrinology arose from the recognition that the brain, especially the hypothalamus, controls secretion of pituitary gland hormones, and has subsequently expanded to investigate numerous interconnections of the endocrine and nervous systems. The neuroendocrine system is the mechanism by which the hypothalamus maintains homeostasis, regulating reproduction, metabolism, eating and drinking behaviour, energy utilization, osmolarity and blood pressure. Neuroendocrine system Major neuroendocrine systems = *Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) *Hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis (HPT axis) *Hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) *Hypothalamic–neurohypophyseal system =Hypothalamus= The endocrine system consists of numerous glands throughout the body that produce and secrete hormones of diverse chemical structure, including peptides, steroids, and neuroamines. Collectively, hormones regulate many physiological processes. Oxytocin and vasopressin (also called anti-diuretic hormone), the two neurohypophysial hormones of the posterior pituitary gland (the neurohypophysis), are secreted from the nerve endings of magnocellular neurosecretory cells into the systemic circulation. The cell bodies of the oxytocin and vasopressin neurons are in the paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus, respectively, and the electrical activity of these neurons is regulated by afferent synaptic inputs from other brain regions. By contrast, the hormones of the anterior pituitary gland (the adenohypophysis) are secreted from endocrine cells that, in mammals, are not directly innervated, yet the secretion of these hormones (adrenocorticotrophic hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and growth hormone) remains under the control of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls the anterior pituitary gland via releasing factors and release-inhibiting factors; these are blood-borne substances [author means via bloodstream and not by the lymphatic system nor air, nor any other modes of transport] released by hypothalamic neurons into blood vessels at the base of the brain, at the median eminence. These vessels, the hypothalamo-hypophysial portal vessels, carry the hypothalamic factors to the anterior pituitary, where they bind to specific receptors on the surface of the hormone-producing cells. For example, the secretion of growth hormone is controlled by two neuroendocrine systems: the growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) neurons and the somatostatin neurons, which stimulate and inhibit secretion, respectively. The GHRH neurones are located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, whereas the somatostatin cells involved in growth hormone regulation are in the periventricular nucleus. These two neuronal systems project axons to the median eminence, where they release their peptides into portal blood vessels for transport to the anterior pituitary. Growth hormone is secreted in pulses, which arise from alternating episodes of GHRH release and somatostatin release, which may reflect neuronal interactions between the GHRH and somatostatin cells, and negative feedback from growth hormone. The neuroendocrine systems control reproduction in all its aspects, from bonding to sexual behaviour. They control spermatogenesis and the ovarian cycle, parturition, lactation, and maternal behaviour. They control the body's response to stress and infection. They regulate the body's metabolism, influencing eating and drinking behaviour, and influence how energy intake is utilised, that is, how fat is metabolised. They influence and regulate mood, body fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, and blood pressure. The neurons of the neuroendocrine system are large; they are mini factories for producing secretory products; their nerve terminals are large and organised in coherent terminal fields; their output can often be measured easily in the blood; and what these neurons do and what stimuli they respond to are readily open to hypothesis and experiment. Hence, neuroendocrine neurons are good \\"model systems\\" for studying general questions, like \\"how does a neuron regulate the synthesis, packaging, and secretion of its product?\\" and \\"how is information encoded in electrical activity?\\"[It appears that this is a primary source observation.] =Pituitary gland= The pituitary gland is divided into two sections: the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary. The hypothalamus controls the anterior pituitary's hormone secretion by sending trophic hormones down the hypothalamohypophysial portal system. For example, thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulates the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone by the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is innervated by the hypothalamus; the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin are synthesized by neuroendocrine cells in the hypothalamus and stored at the nerves' ends in the posterior pituitary. They are secreted directly into systemic circulation by the hypothalamic neurons. HistoryPioneers= Ernst and Berta Scharrer, of the University of Munich the Albert Einstein College of Medicine are credited as co-founders the field of neuroendocrinology with their initial observations and proposals in 1945 concerning neuropeptides. Geoffrey Harris is considered by many to be the \\"father\\" of neuroendocrinology. Harris, the Dr. Lee's Professor of Anatomy at Oxford University, is credited with showing that the anterior pituitary gland of mammals is regulated by hormones secreted by hypothalamic neurons into the hypothalamohypophysial portal circulation. By contrast, the hormones of the posterior pituitary gland are secreted into the systemic circulation directly from the nerve endings of hypothalamic neurons. This seminal work was done in collaboration with Dora Jacobsohn of Lund University. The first of these factors to be identified are thyrotropin- releasing hormone (TRH) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). TRH is a small peptide that stimulates the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone; GnRH (also called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) stimulates the secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. Roger Guillemin, a medical student of Faculté de Médecine of Lyon, and Andrew W. Schally of Tulane University isolated these factors from the hypothalamus of sheep and pigs, and then identified their structures. Guillemin and Schally were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1977 for their contributions to understanding \\"the peptide hormone production of the brain\\". In 1952, Andor Szentivanyi, of the University of South Florida, and Geza Filipp wrote the world's first research paper showing how neural control of immunity takes place through the hypothalamus. (Warning: automatic background music) =Modern scope= Today, neuroendocrinology embraces a wide range of topics that arose directly or indirectly from the core concept of neuroendocrine neurons. Neuroendocrine neurons control the gonads, whose steroids, in turn, influence the brain, as do corticosteroids secreted from the adrenal gland under the influence of adrenocorticotrophic hormone. The study of these feedbacks became the province of neuroendocrinologists. The peptides secreted by hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurons into the blood proved to be released also into the brain, and the central actions often appeared to complement the peripheral actions. So understanding these central actions also became the province of neuroendocrinologists, sometimes even when these peptides cropped up in quite different parts of the brain that appeared to serve functions unrelated to endocrine regulation. Neuroendocrine neurons were discovered in the peripheral nervous system, regulating, for instance, digestion. The cells in the adrenal medulla that release adrenaline and noradrenaline proved to have properties between endocrine cells and neurons, and proved to be outstanding model systems for instance for the study of the molecular mechanisms of exocytosis. And these, too, have become, by extension, neuroendocrine systems. Neuroendocrine systems have been important to our understanding of many basic principles in neuroscience and physiology, for instance, our understanding of stimulus-secretion coupling. The origins and significance of patterning in neuroendocrine secretion are still dominant themes in neuroendocrinology today. Neuroendocrinology is also used as an integral part of understanding and treating neurobiological brain disorders. One example is the augmentation of the treatment of mood symptoms with thyroid hormone. Another is the finding of a transthyretin (thyroxine transport) problem in the cerebrospinal fluid of some patients diagnosed with schizophrenia.

The name is derived from the Japanese word for the sap of the Chinese lacquer tree, urushi. Other plants in the sumac family (including mango, pistachio, the Burmese lacquer tree, the India marking nut tree, and the shell of the cashew) also contain urushiol, as do unrelated plants such as Ginkgo biloba.Lepoittevin, J.-P., Benezra, C., Asakawa, Y. 1989. Allergic contact dermatitis to Ginkgo biloba L.: relationship with urushiol. Arch. Dermatol. Res., 281: 227-230. As is the case with all contact dermatitis, urushiol- induced allergic rashes are a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction, also known as delayed-type hypersensitivity. Symptoms include itching, inflammation, oozing, and, in severe cases, a burning sensation. The American Academy of Dermatology estimates that there are up to 50 million cases of urushiol-induced dermatitis annually in the United States alone, accounting for 10% of all lost-time injuries in the United States Forest Service. Poison oak is a significant problem in the rural Western and Southern United States, while poison ivy is most rampant in the Eastern United States. Dermatitis from poison sumac is less common. Signs and symptoms Urushiol causes an eczematous contact dermatitis characterized by redness, swelling, papules, vesicles, blisters, and streaking. People vary greatly in their sensitivity to urushiol. In approximately 15% to 30% of people, urushiol does not trigger an immune system response, while at least 25% of people have a very strong immune response resulting in severe symptoms. Since the skin reaction is an allergic one, people may develop progressively stronger reactions after repeated exposures, or have no immune response on their first exposure but show sensitivity on subsequent exposures. Approximately 80% to 90% of adults will get a rash if they are exposed to 50 micrograms of purified urushiol. Some people are so sensitive that it only takes a trace of urushiol (two micrograms, or less than one ten-millionth of an ounce) on the skin to initiate an allergic reaction. The rash takes one to two weeks to run its course and may cause scars, depending on the severity of the exposure. Severe cases involve small (1–2 mm), clear, fluid-filled blisters on the skin. Pus-filled vesicles containing a whitish fluid may indicate an infection. Most poison ivy rashes, without infections, will resolve within 14 days without treatment. Excessive scratching may result in infection, commonly by staphylococcal and streptococcal species; these may require antibiotics. File:Severe allergic reaction to urushiol (poison oak) 4 days after exposure.JPGSevere allergic reaction to urushiol (poison oak) 4 days after exposure. File:URUSHIOL BLISTERING.jpgBlistering 48 hours after urushiol contact. File:Poisonivyrash.jpgPoison ivy rash after 2 days. File:Poison ivy with swelling.jpgPoison ivy rash with swelling about 3 days after direct contact.  Cause  Toxicodendron pubescens (Atlantic poison oak), one of a large number of species containing urushiol irritants. Urushiol-induced contact dermatitis is caused by contact with a plant or any other object containing urushiol oil. The oil adheres to almost anything with which it comes in contact, such as towels, blankets, clothing, and landscaping tools. Clothing or other materials that touch the plant and then, before being washed, touch the skin are common causes of exposure. For people who have never been exposed or are not yet allergic to urushiol, it may take 10 to 21 days for a reaction to occur the first time. Once allergic to urushiol, however, most people break out 48 to 72 hours after contact with the oil. Typically, individuals have been exposed at least once, if not several times, before they develop a rash. The rash typically persists one to two weeks, but in some cases may last up to five weeks. Urushiol is primarily found in the spaces between cells beneath the outer skin of the plant, so the effects are less severe if the plant tissue remains undamaged on contact. Once the oil and resin are thoroughly washed from the skin, the rash is not contagious. Urushiol does not always spread once it has bonded with the skin, and cannot be transferred once the urushiol has been washed away. Although simple skin exposure is most common, ingestion of urushiol can lead to serious, systemic reactions. Burning plant material is commonly said to create urushiol-laden smoke that causes a systemic reaction, as well as a rash in the throat and eyes. Firefighters often get rashes and eye inflammation from smoke-related contact. A high- temperature bonfire may incinerate urushiol before it can cause harm, while a smoldering fire may vaporize the volatile oil and spread it as white smoke. However, some sources dispute the danger of burning urushiol-containing plant material.  Mechanism  A video describing the mechanism of action for poison ivy and other plants containing urushiol. Urushiols are oxidized in- vivo, generating a quinone form of the molecules. The toxic effect is indirect, mediated by an induced immune response. The oxidized urushiols act as haptens, chemically reacting with, binding to, and changing the shape of integral membrane proteins on exposed skin cells. Affected proteins interfere with the immune system's ability to recognize these cells as normal parts of the body, causing a T-cell-mediated immune response.C.Michael Hogan (2008) Western poison-oak: Toxicodendron diversilobum, GlobalTwitcher, ed. Nicklas Stromberg This response is directed at the complex of urushiol derivatives (namely, pentadecacatechol) bound in the skin proteins, attacking the cells as if they were foreign bodies.  Treatments  Treatment consists of two phases: stopping the urushiol contact that is causing the reaction (this must be done within minutes) and, later, reducing the pain and/or itching. Primary treatment involves washing exposed skin thoroughly with soap, cool water, and friction as soon as possible after exposure is discovered. Soap or detergent is necessary because urushiol is an oil; friction, with a washcloth or something similar, is necessary because urushiol adheres strongly to the skin. Commercial removal preparations, which are available in areas where poison ivy grows, usually contain surfactants, such as the nonionic detergent Triton X-100, to solubilize urushiol; some products also contain abrasives. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends applying a wet compress or soaking the affected area in cool water; topical corticosteroids (available over-the- counter) or oral corticosteroids (available by prescription); and topical skin protectants, such as zinc acetate, zinc carbonate, zinc oxide, and calamine. Baking soda or colloidal oatmeal can relieve minor irritation and itching. Aluminium acetate, sometimes known as Burow's solution, can also ease the rash. Showers or compresses using hot (but not scalding) water can relieve itching for up to several hours, though this \\"also taxes the skin's integrity, opening pores and generally making it more vulnerable\\", and is only useful for secondary treatment (not for cleaning urushiol from the skin, which should be done with cold water). People who have had a prior systemic reaction may be able to prevent subsequent exposure from turning systemic by avoiding heat and excitation of the circulatory system and applying moderate cold to any infected skin with biting pain. Antihistamine creams, or oral antihistamines, do not alleviate the itching of a developed urushiol-induced contact rash. This is because of the underlying histamine-independent physiology of a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction. The sleepiness that first generation oral antihistamines (i.e., diphenhydramine and other first generation H1 antagonists) produce may help people ignore the itch during the night, but do not stop nighttime scratching and may actually decrease overall sleep quality. In cases of extreme symptoms, steroids such as prednisone, triamcinolone, or dexamethasone are sometimes administered to attenuate the immune response and prevent long-term skin damage, especially if the eyes are involved. Prednisone is the most commonly prescribed systemic treatment but can cause serious adrenal suppression, so it must be taken carefully and tapered off slowly. If bacterial secondary infection of affected areas occurs, antibiotics may also be necessary. Scrubbing with plain soap and cold water will remove urushiol from skin if it is done within a few minutes of exposure.Bill Einsig, Bill (2002), Poison Ivy Myth: Science, Environment and Ecology Flash for Educators (No. 341), in Keystone Outdoors Magazine (May 11), excerpted by the Penn State Integrated Pest Management, accessed 7 October 2015. Many home remedies and commercial products (e.g., Tecnu, Zanfel) also claim to prevent urushiol rashes after exposure. A study that compared Tecnu ($1.25/oz.) with Goop Hand Cleaner or Dial Ultra Dishwashing Soap ($0.07/oz.) found that differences among the three—in the range of 56–70% improvement over no treatment—were nonsignificant (P > 0.05), but that improvement over no treatment was significant at the same level of confidence. = Further observations = * Ordinary laundering with laundry detergent will remove urushiol from most clothing but not from leather or suede. * Urushiol oil left on clothing and surfaces can be deactivated using bleach. * The fluid from the resulting blisters does not spread urushiol to others. * Blisters should be left unbroken during healing. * Poison ivy and poison oak are still harmful when the leaves have fallen off, as the toxic residue is persistent, and exposure to any parts of plants containing urushiol can cause a rash at any time of the year. * Ice, cold water, cooling lotions, and cold air do not help cure poison ivy rashes, but cooling can reduce inflammation and soothe the itch. * Results for jewelweed as a natural agent for treatment are conflicting. Some studies indicate that it \\"failed to decrease symptoms of poison ivy dermatitis\\" [1980] and had \\"no prophylactic effect\\" [1997]. The juice of the leaves and stems of Impatiens capensis is a traditional Native American remedy for skin rashes, including poison ivy.Smith, Huron H., 1933, Ethnobotany of the Forest Potawatomi Indians, Bulletin of the Public Museum of the City of Milwaukee 7:1-230, page 42 A peer-reviewed study in 2012 suggests the mechanism of action may be saponins in the plant acting in a manner similar to soap. The study further indicates soap is more effective and should be preferred if available.

Crowd counting or crowd estimating is a technique used to count or estimate the number of people in a crowd. The most direct method is to actually count each person in the crowd. For example, turnstiles are often used to precisely count the number of people entering an event. At events in streets or a park rather than an enclosed venue, crowd counting is more difficult and less precise. For many events, especially political rallies or protests, the number of people in a crowd carries political significance and count results are controversial. For example, the global protests against the Iraq war had many protests with widely differing counts offered by organizers on one side and the police on the other side. Another memorable incident occurred when Louis Farrakhan threatened to sue the Washington, D.C. Park Police for announcing that only 400,000 people attended the 1995 Million Man March he organized. The National Park Police still estimates crowd size for its own planning purposes, but does not publicly reveal the figures. Jacobs' Method  The most common technique for counting crowds at protests and rallies is Jacobs' Method, named for its inventor, Herbert Jacobs. Jacobs' method involves dividing the area occupied by a crowd into sections, determining an average number of people in each section, and multiplying by the number of sections occupied. According to a report by Life's Little Mysteries, technologies sometimes used to assist such estimations include \\"lasers, satellites, aerial photography, 3-D grid systems, recorded video footage and surveillance balloons, usually tethered several blocks around an event's location and flying 400 to 800 feet (120 to 240 meters) overhead.\\" References Nicholas Wing Ta Zhen.

Formerly, the termites were considered a separate order, Isoptera, but genetic and molecular evidence suggests an intimate relationship with the cockroaches, both cockroaches and termites having evolved from a common ancestor. The Blattodea and the mantises (order Mantodea) are now all considered part of the superorder Dictyoptera. Blattodea includes approximately 4,400 species of cockroach in almost 500 genera, and about 3,000 species of termite in around 300 genera. Termites are pale-coloured, soft-bodied eusocial insects that live in colonies, whereas cockroaches are darker-coloured (often brown), sclerotized, segmented insects. Within the colony, termites have a caste system, with a pair of mature reproductives, the king and the queen, and numerous sterile workers and soldiers. The cockroaches are not colonial but do have a tendency to aggregate and may be considered pre-social, as all adults are capable of breeding. Other similarities between the two groups include various social behaviours, trail following, kin recognition and methods of communication. Phylogeny and evolution Fossil cockroach from Carboniferous of France Cladistic analysis of five DNA sequences in 107 species representing all the termite subfamilies, all six cockroach families, including 22 of the 29 subfamilies, and 5 of the 15 mantis families (as out-groups) showed that the termites are nested within the cockroaches, and that the Cryptocercidae is a sister group to the termites. The mantids were shown to be the sister group to Blattodea. Cryptocercus also shares characteristics such as species of gut bacteria with the termites. The cockroach families Lamproblattidae and Tryonicidae are not shown but are placed within the superfamily Blattoidea. The cockroach families Corydiidae and Ectobiidae were previously known as the Polyphagidae and Blattellidae. The evolutionary relationships of the Blattodea (cockroaches and termites), based on Eggleton, Beccaloni & Inward (2007), are shown in the cladogram: The cladogram also shows the family Alienopteridae (originally assigned to its own order \\"Alienoptera\\") as sister to Mantodea, but it was subsequently reassigned to the extinct Blattodea superfamily Umenocoleoidea by Vršanský et al.. Diversity Over 4000 species of cockroaches are found in every corner of the globe with each continent having its own indigenous species. Most of these are omnivores or detritivores and live in a range of habitats such as among leaf litter, in rotting wood, in thick vegetation, in crevices, in cavities beneath bark, under logs and among debris. Some are arboreal, some live in caves and some are aquatic. A small number of species have taken to living in close proximity to humans in buildings, have been transported around the world by them, and are regarded as pests. Although some species harbour symbionts in their guts which facilitate cellulose digestion, many species also produce enzymes to digest cellulose independent of the symbionts. Over 3000 species of termite are found in all the continents except Antarctica. The greatest diversity is found in Africa and relatively few species inhabit Europe and North America. They are also detrivores and many species eat wood, having specialised guts with symbiotic protozoa to digest the cellulose. Termites have soft bodies and keep out of sight as far as possible. They can loosely be subdivided into dampwood, drywood and subterranean types. In general, dampwood termites inhabit coniferous forests, drywood termites inhabit hardwood forests and subterranean termites live in a wide variety of habitats. Characteristics Termites are eusocial insects that live in colonies. They operate a caste system, there being a king and queen in each colony and many non-reproductive workers. The workers forage for food which they bring back to the colony to feed the reproductives and the developing young. Cockroaches are also social insects but do not live in colonies, and all adults are able to reproduce. Some species form aggregations, others show an inclination to aggregate, and some exhibit parental care of their offspring. Cockroaches and termites have striking similarities in behaviour which they likely inherited from their common ancestor. These include an attraction to warm and humid places, thigmotaxis, burrowing, substrate manipulation, hygienic behaviour, food sharing, cannibalism, excretion behaviour, vibrational communication, kin recognition, trail following, allogrooming, care of the brood, cropping of antennae and certain mating behaviours. In some of these behaviours, there are marked similarities between termites and juvenile, but not adult, cockroaches. During the evolution of eusociality, the individuals need to share a desire to group together. Juvenile cockroaches have a tendency to aggregate while adults often compete aggressively with each other for space and resources. Similarly, grooming and being groomed is common in termite colonies but allogrooming is not a behaviour generally engaged in by cockroaches although individuals groom themselves. An exception to this is the cockroach Cryptocercus, which seems to be more closely related to the termites than to other cockroaches. Here juveniles groom each other and also groom adults. Both groups are also affected by their social environments. A single termite, kept alone, has a significantly decreased level of vigour and a shorter lifespan than when two are kept together. An isolated cockroach nymph may grow at less than half the rate of grouped individuals, and has a poorer life expectancy. Both termites and cockroaches engage in coprophagy, the consumption of fecal pellets. Adult termite workers forage and bring food back to the nest where they pass it to the reproductives and young either by mouth or by anus, providing the whole of their nutritional needs in this manner. Young cockroaches are ineffective foragers, seldom straying from their hiding places, and obtain much of their nourishment from eating the fecal pellets of larger individuals. From these they acquire the microbial flora that helps them to digest their food. A single cockroach family, the Cryptocercidae, and one primitive species of termite, Mastotermes darwiniensis, share such characteristics as the segmental origin of certain female reproductive structures, and the fact that both deposit their eggs in the oothecae that are typical of cockroaches. Cockroaches American cockroach Arthropods similar to living cockroaches dominated the insect communities of the Carboniferous period. Modern cockroaches radiated from them by the middle of the Mesozoic. This group of insects are nocturnal, only foraging for food and water at night. They are not considered eusocial because their populations are not divided into different caste systems; however, they are still social creatures and can live in groups with over a million individuals. The cockroach is flattened dorsolaterally and is roughly oval with a shield-like plate, the pronotum, covering its thorax and posterior region of the head. The antennae are many-segmented, long and slender, and the mouthparts are adapted for chewing. The forewings are normally leathery and the hind wings membranous. The coxae of the legs are flattened to enable the femurs to fit neatly against them when folded. Cockroaches are hemimetabolous; there is no pupal stage and the nymphs resemble the adults apart from their size and the absence of wings. Female cockroaches produce an egg sac known as an ootheca and can hold anywhere from 12-25 eggs depending upon the species. Some species display parenting behavior, whereas other species have nothing to do with the young. In most species, growth to maturity takes three to four months, but in a few species, the nymph stage can last for several years. The main factors affecting the duration of the nymph stage are seasonal differences, and the amount of nutrients received in the diet. = Chemical communication = As in most insect species, cockroaches communicate with one another by the release of pheromones. It has also been discovered that cockroaches release hydrocarbons from their body that are transferred through interactions of the antennae. These hydrocarbons can aid in cockroach communication and can even tell whether an individual is a member of its kin or not to prevent inbreeding. Cockroaches that have been isolated in a lab setting have shown extreme behavioral effects and are less stimulated by these hydrocarbons and pheromones, possibly suggesting a group environment is required for development of these communication skills. Termites Termites All species of termite are to some degree eusocial, and the members of a colony are differentiated into caste systems. The majority of termite populations consist of the worker caste, which are responsible for foraging, nest building, grooming, and brood care. The soldier caste has one responsibility, which is to protect the nest from predators and other competitors. Soldiers have highly developed mandibles as well as many exocrine glands that can secrete multiple defensive substances harmful to predators. Normally, only the king and queen termite reproduce; the other castes are all sterile. There are two classes of reproductives: primary reproductives and neotenic reproductives. The primary reproductives class is responsible for colony creation and is characterized by compound eyes, wing marks (spots where wings once were before shedding), and defined sclerotization. Neonetic reproductives can develop from within the colony usually when one of the primary reproductives has died, or can develop in addition to the queen. Neonetic reproductives can experience two different phenotypes, one with wings and one without. If neonetics are winged they will fly away from the parental colony, pair up and form a new colony, but if they are wingless they will remain within the parental colony. The different developmental routes taken by these two morphs are usually dependent upon food availability in the colony, or varying levels of parasitism within the colony. The caste into which any particular nymph will develop begins to become apparent among the late instars; at this time, potential reproductives will begin to show an increase in the size of the gonadal region. Cathedral termite mounds, Northern Territory, Australia Termite colonies may be arboreal, mound- like or subterranean, with primitive termites nesting completely inside enclosed structures such as stumps or logs. Nest construction is largely from the termites' own faecal matter, other materials being chewed vegetable fibre, which makes a weak carton-like but waterproof substance, and soil, which makes a strong substance, but which is subject to erosion by water. Aerial nests are connected to the ground by enclosed passageways; the soft-bodied, blind workers of most species live permanently in their protected environments and do not venture into the open air. Trinervitermes trinervoides is an exception to this, with workers foraging in small groups on the surface at night, secreting noxious terpenes to deter predators. The nests are complex structures, and tunnels link them to the foraging areas. In Africa, termite mounds can be as large as nine meters tall and thirty meters in diameter, producing an area of increased fertility and creating a small hotspot for biodiversity.

It is the best known member of the nothosaur order. Description Nothosaurus mirabilis Nothosaurus was a semi-oceanic animal which probably had a lifestyle similar to that of today's seals. It was about , with long, webbed toes and possibly a fin on its tail. However, some species such as N. zhangi and N. giganteus were larger, up to . When swimming, Nothosaurus would use its tail, legs, and webbed feet to propel and steer it through the water. The skull was broad and flat, with long jaws, lined with needle teeth, it probably caught fish and other marine creatures. Trackways attributed, partly by process of elimination, to a nothosaur, that were reported from Yunnan, China in June 2014, were interpreted as the paddle impressions left as the animals dug into soft seabed with rowing motions of their paddles, churning up hidden benthic creatures that they snapped up.(LiveScience) Tia Ghose, \\"Ancient long- necked 'sea monsters' rowed their way to prey\\", reporting the scientific article published in Nature Communications 11 June 2014: accessed 28 November 2014. Once caught, few animals would be able to shake themselves free from the mouth of Nothosaurus. In many respects its body structure resembled that of the much later plesiosaurs, but it was not as well adapted to an aquatic environment. It is thought that one branch of the nothosaurs may have evolved into pliosaurs such as Liopleurodon, a short-necked plesiosaur that grew up to , and the long-necked Cryptoclidus, a fish eater with a neck as long as . Species Nothosaurus jagisteus There are nearly a dozen known species of Nothosaurus. The type species is N. mirabilis, named in 1834 from the Germanic Muschelkalk. Other species include N. giganteus (previously known as Paranothosaurus) from Osnabrück, Germany; N. juvenilis, also from Germany; N. edingerae from the Upper Muschelkalk and Lower Keuper; N. haasi and N. tchernovi from Makhtesh Ramon, Israel; N. cymatosauroides from the Spanish Muschelkalk; N. jagisteus from the Upper Muschelkalk of Hohenlohe, Germany; and N. youngi, N. yangjuanensis (and its junior synonym N. rostellatus) and the recently named N. zhangi from Guizhou, China. Several species have been described from the Lower Muschelkalk in Winterswijk, the Netherlands, including N. marchicus (and its junior synonym N. winterswijkensis) and the recently named N. winkelhorsti. Klein and Albers (2009) conducted a phylogenetic analysis, but did not test the monophyly of Nothosaurus, as other nothosaurids were not included in their analysis. Several other species have been named but are now generally considered invalid. One such species, N. procerus, is now considered a junior subjective synonym of N. marchicus. Other species now considered junior synonyms of N. marchicus include N. crassus, N. oldenburgi, N. raabi, N. schroderi, N. venustus and the recently named N. winterswijkensis. Junior synonyms of N. giganteus, the second largest Nothosaurus species, include N. andriani, N. angustifronis, N. aduncidens, N. baruthicus and N. chelydrops. A species level phylogenetic analysis of Nothosauridae was performed by Liu et al. (2014), and included all known valid species of the family and Nothosaurus apart from Lariosaurus stensioi (type of Micronothosaurus), Nothosaurus cymatosauroides, and Ceresiosaurus lanzi. Due to the inclusion of other nothosaurids other than Nothosaurus, the monophyly of Nothosaurus was tested for the first time. The analysis found both Lariosaurus and Nothosaurus to be polyphyletic in regard to each-other and all the other genera of the family, making a systematic revision of these two genera necessary. Below, their results are shown with type species of named nothosaurid genera noted. Later, in 2017, the species N. juvenilis, N. youngi, and N. winkelhorsti were formally moved to Lariosaurus.

The most common variety is Apfelschorle (made from apple juice and sparkling mineral water). Large bottles of Schorle can be found at most grocers, stores, supermarkets and anywhere else where carbonated drinks are sold, next to the soda. Due to its dilution it is less sweet or alcoholic than the original beverage, making it better suited as a refreshment on hot summer days or as an alternative to beer at the biergarten or . Typical proportions are half seltzer in a high glass and half juice or wine. In the Palatinate, in Germany, a wine schorle may consist of considerably less than 1/2 water if it is ordered 'fett' (German for 'fat').  Varieties  There is no specific word for Schorle in the English language. However, Spritzer is very similar with the slight difference of Schorle typically being a freshly mixed drink and not usually sold in cans or bottles as spritzers sometimes are. Schorle, Spritzer and Gespritzter are all expressions for similar variations of Schorle: * Wine with mineral water # sour Schorle (“Schorle sauer”), sour spritzed Schorle (“Sauergespritzter”) # in Austria: white/red spritzed or simply spritzer (“Gespritzter” or “G’spritzter”) * Wine with lemonade # sweet Schorle which is also known as the “Arbeitersekt” which can be translated as “worker’s sparkling wine” * Wine with Cola # ”Cola-Schoppen” # in Austria: red Cola or white Cola * Juice with mineral water # ”Juice-Schorle”, “Fruit-Schorle” or “Fruit-Juice-Schorle” # in Austria: spritzed apple juice, spritzed orange juice etc. Schorle (usually with the female German article “die”, but in Baden-Württemberg typically with the neutral German article “das” or male German article “der” and in the Palatinate area with the male German article “der” as well) is very popular as a refreshment especially in summer. The mixing proportions are mostly approximately 1:1 but in case of Schorle with juice the proportions are usually unbalanced and there is often far more mineral water in the drink.  Origin of the Term Schorle  According to the Duden dictionary of etymology, the word Schorlemorle, which occurred first as Schurlemurle in Lower Bavaria, is since the 18th century a designation for a mixed drink consisting of wine and sparkling mineral water. The origin of the word is uncertain; perhaps it is due to a play on words, similar to that in the 16th century, where the designations for beer, scormorrium in Münster and Murlepuff in Strasbourg, could be ascertained. The Southern German word Schurimuri, which dates from the 16th century and means “excited, hectic”, and the older Low German word Schurrmurr, which means “mishmash”, might be related to it.Duden. Band 7: Günther Drosdowski (Hrsg.): Duden „Etymologie“. Das Herkunftswörterbuch der deutschen Sprache. 2. völlig neu bearbeitete und erweiterte Auflage. Dudenverlag, Mannheim u. a. 1989, , Stichwort Schorle. According to Kluge, the word Schorlemorle, however, is probably based upon the vernacular Southern German word schuren, which means \\"to bubble\\" or \\"to fizz\\". In an article of the Südwest Presse, Henning Petershagen lists also other attempts to interpret the origin of this word, for example a linguistic relationship to the Dutch term schorriemorrie, which means \\"ragtag\\" or \\"rabble\\". The digitale bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse letteren provides evidence that the word originates from the Persian-Turkish schurmur which means \\"confusion, turmoil\\" and is similarly present in Albanian, Serbian, Slovenian and Russian, up to the Spanish churriburri. The latter can be found in the dictionary of the royal-Spanish Academy as zurriburri (\\"muddle\\", \\"base subject\\", \\"plebs\\"). Schorle is said to have formed thus; the oriental schurimuri came to Europe with its original meaning \\"muddle\\" where it was established as a character denotation (also as family name) and as a term to refer to the beverage- muddle.  Mixing with Wine  Germany = Schorle made with fruit juice is subject to the order on the regulation of fruit and soft drinks (cf. Fruchtsaft- und Erfrischungsgetränkeverordnung).  Weinschorle (wine spritzer)  Wine is the basis of „wine schorle“ or “wine spritzer“. Preferred wine varieties are Riesling (Riesling schorle / Riesling spritzer), Blauer Portugieser, vin gris, Müller-Thurgau, Silvaner or other red wine. Depending on what the wine is mixed with, a wine schorle is called “sour” when it is prepared with carbonated water, “sweet” when prepared with carbonated lemonade, or also “sweet and sour” when made with both mineral water and lemonade. In the Palatinate, the ratio of wine is often much larger; depending on the waiting staff, the glass is filled almost completely with wine and diluted with only a spritzer of water, especially in wine bars and at wine festivals. In the Palatinate, schorle is traditionally served in a special glass that holds 0.5 liters, a Palatinate pint glass. A regional term for this glass is “Dubbeglas”. Similarly to schorle, wine is sometimes mixed with cola: red cola and white cola, meaning cola mixed with red or white wine respectively.  Gespritzter  Schorle is also called Gespritzter in some areas of Germany but this doesn’t always mean the same thing: In Hesse ‘Gespritzer’ stands for a 2:1, sometimes even a 3:1 mixture of apple wine and sparkling water. At traditional apple wine pubs, this mixture is only served in corrugated apple wine glasses. Today it is also known as Sauergespritzter, so that it can be differentiated from ‘Süßgespritzten’, which is made with Lemonade. In Rheinhessen a ‘Gespritzter’ or ‘sauer Gespritzter’ is a mixture made out of white wine or red wine together with sparkling water. In addition, there are also mixtures with cola or Lemonade. In Bavaria and Austria 'Gespritzter' basically refers to the same drink. = Austria = According to §3 of the German Weinbezeichnungsverordnung, which is a decree for the labelling of wine, a G'spritzter (also Gespritzter, Spritzer) is a drink mixed with at least 50% wine and 50% soda or mineral water at the most. The drink itself has to contain at least 4,5 % per vol. of alcohol. The name Schorle is unusual in Austria. Colloquially the expression Sommerspritzer or Sommergespritzter is used for a mixture with less wine and Winterspritzer for a mixture with more wine. There are red as well as white Gespritzter, though until the 1980s only mixtures with white wine were served in rural areas. Normally no special grape variety is specified, in practice only tablewines are used. Most often Grüner Veltliner (white grape variety) or Zweigelt (red grape variety) is used. Costumarily, Gespritzer is served in 0.25-litre- stemware or mug-like glass. If a large Gespritzer is ordered, one gets 0.4 or 0.5 litre mostly in a beer mug. Sweet Gespritzer is made with herbal lemonade (for example Almdudler), other terms are Almweiß, Liftler oder Tiroler. A Kaiserspritzer or Kaisergespritzter (emperor spritz) respectively is Gespritzer with a shot of elderflower syrup. In Vienna, on rare occasions a Gespritzter is also called “Sprüher” or “Sprühwein”. In some areas of Lower Austria it is also called “Siphon”. In Styria it is called “Mischung” (mixture). In the state of Vorarlberg the names “white-sweet”, “white-sour”, \\"red-sour” and \\"red-sweet” are common. These are Gespritze served in 0.25 litre stemware or glasses with a handle. The mixing ratio is about 50% white or red wine with 50% sparkling water (sour) or Lemonade (sweet). The name Gespritzter is universally understood but rarely used. The Styrian name “Mischung” is largely unknown here. A “Gespritzter” or “die Gespritzte” (for females) is also often used as a derogatory term for a person in Eastern Austria. = Switzerland = In Switzerland, a \\"Gespritzter\\" is white wine mixed with either mineral water (a \\"Sauergespritzter\\", or sour spritzer) or with lemonade (a \\"Süßgespritzter\\", or sweet spritzer). = Hungary = The various mixtures of (generally dry) wine and sparkling mineral water also have a long tradition and are very popular in Hungary. They are generally called fröccs (spritzers) but the numerous variations (with wine and water in differing ratios) have various imaginative names in Hungarian. = Other Countries = Derived from Austrian Gespritzten, Spritz (or Spriz, Spriss or Sprisseto) is also drunk in Italy. In the former Yugoslavian area, wine with mineral water is commonly called špricer or gemišt (spritzer or mixer). The combination of red wine with cola or lemonade is however called (especially in Croatia) Bambus. In Spain, the combination of red wine and lemonade is known as Tinto de verano. In the Basque country, a popular drink is kalimotxo, a combination of red wine and cola. In Great Britain, red or white wine mixed with lemonade or carbonated water has been well known since the 1980s as a spritzer. In the United States, similar drinks are known as wine coolers.  Mixing with Juice  Schorle with juice, also known as \\"fruit schorle\\" or \\"fruit juice schorle\\", is a mixture of, in most cases, carbonated water and fruit juice. Because of its massive popularity, drink manufacturers offer bottled fruit schorle. The proportion of water to juice can vary considerably, however it is typically under 50%, usually 40% to 60%. \\"Apfelschorle\\" is particularly popular but sourer or bitterer varieties of fruit also work quite well; for example using grapefruit, which has juice that, when undiluted, is otherwise less palatable. It is also good for diluting particularly sweet varieties of fruit, such as cherry juice schorle. Fruit juice schorle contains less energy (physiological energy) than pure fruit juice. = Apfelschorle (apple juice spritzer) = Apple schorle is often drunk as a sports drink since it contains both minerals and carbohydrates and is almost isotonic. Commercially available apple schorlen have a fruit content between 55% and 60% and contain 5 to 6 grams of fructose. Sometimes synthetic apple flavouring is added, which can give the drink an unnatural and strange taste.Stiftung Warentest: Apfelschorlen: Nicht wie selbst gemischt, test 5/2001.

He originated play-by-play sports broadcasting for which he was awarded the Ford C. Frick Award by the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2016. Early life and career  Graham McNamee's father, John B. McNamee, was an attorney and legal advisor to President Grover Cleveland's cabinet, and his mother, Anne, was a homemaker, who also sang in a church choir. Born in Washington, D.C. and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota, McNamee had early aspirations of being an opera singer. He studied voice as a youth and sang in churches, and in 1922 gave a concert in Aeolian Hall, New York. In 1922, while serving jury duty in New York City, he visited the studios of radio station WEAF en route to the courthouse and, on a whim, went to audition as a singer. Someone noticed his voice and asked him to speak through a microphone. He was given an audition and hired as a staff announcer on the spot. Along with fellow WEAF announcer Phillips Carlin, whose voice was so similar that few listeners could tell them apart, McNamee quickly became famous. Over the course of the next decade McNamee worked for WEAF, and for the national NBC network, when WEAF became the its flagship station. Sportscasting McNamee at the 1924 World Series McNamee became well-known for his broadcasts of numerous sports events, including several World Series, Rose Bowl games, championship boxing matches, and Indianapolis 500 races. Radio broadcasting of sporting events was a new thing in the 1920s. The announcers were a rotating group of newspaper writers. At the time baseball was America's most popular sport, and the reporters were at the games to write stories about them for print newspapers. Their descriptions were matter-of-fact, boring at best, had a lot of dead air, and were given in the past tense after a play was completed. In 1923, announcer McNamee was assigned to help the sportswriters with their broadcasts. One day, Grantland Rice, told McNamee to finish the game on his own, and left. McNamee was not a trained sports writer, so he immediately began to describe what he was seeing as it happened, thus originating play-by-play sports broadcasting. He wasn't a baseball expert, but had a knack for conveying what he saw in great detail, and with great enthusiasm, bringing the sights and sounds of the game into the homes of listeners. Other work McNamee also broadcast the national political conventions, the presidential inaugurations, and the arrival of aviator Charles Lindbergh in New York City following his transatlantic flight to Paris, France in 1927. He opened each broadcast by saying, \\"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen of the radio audience. This is Graham McNamee speaking.\\" He was featured on the cover of the October 3, 1927 issue of Time magazine. McNamee continued to broadcast into the 1930s, as an announcer on such weekly programs as Rudy Vallee's, and Ed Wynn's. He played straight man on the latter, reacting to Wynn's gags. He worked in motion pictures, narrating Krakatoa (1933), Universal Pictures' weekly Universal Newsreels, and Camera Thrills (1935), an Academy Award-nominated short subject produced and directed by Charles E. Ford. On April 20, 1936 he also worked in Circus stars bring joy to hospital's little shut-ins (clowns and performers of Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus performed at Bellevue Hospital in New York to amuse children), by Universal Newsreel. In the same year, on July 7, he was briefly reunited with Ed Wynn for an ad-libbed spot on an experimental, NBC television broadcast. In the early 1940s his principal activity was as a newsreel commentator, but he maintained much of his radio work as well, hosting Behind the Mike for NBC. Personal life He was married twice: the first time, in 1921, to concert and church soprano Josephine Garrett. They were divorced in 1932, and he married Anne Lee Sims in 1934. Death McNamee died on May 9, 1942 at St. Lukes Hospital at the age of 53. The cause of death was a brain embolism after he had been hospitalized with a streptococcus infection. He was buried in Mount Calvary Cemetery in Columbus, Ohio. Awards In 1925, at the Radio World Fair, he won a solid gold cup (designed like a microphone) as America's most popular announcer, receiving 189,470 votes out of 1,161,659 votes cast. McNamee's star (lower left) on the Hollywood Walk of Fame In February 1960, McNamee was posthumously recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1964, McNamee was inducted into the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame. In 1984, he was part of the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame's inaugural class, which included sportscasting legends Red Barber, Don Dunphy, Ted Husing and Bill Stern. The National Radio Hall of Fame inducted McNamee in 2011. On December 9, 2015, McNamee was named the 2016 recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, presented during the Hall's induction weekend in July. Cultural references  McNamee is portrayed by actor Dayton Lummis in The Winning Team, the 1952 film biography of Grover Cleveland Alexander.

The baserunner safely advanced from second to third.\\" : \\"With no outs and a runner on second, the manager will call for a sacrifice fly. The pitcher looks over his shoulder at second, turns, takes his stance, and delivers. It is a fastball, hit cleanly into deep right field. The fielder is backpeddling rapidly, and the runner is holding at second. He makes the catch, one out. The runner takes off for third. Here comes the throw, the runner slides, and is SAFE! The crowd cheers wildly.

She first appeared in Uncanny X-Men Annual #4, and was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Romita Jr. based on sketches by John Byrne.http://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/06/05/what-if-john-byrne- designed-nightcrawlers-mother-by-accident/ Margali is Nightcrawler's adopted mother. She is also the biological mother of Amanda Sefton, formerly known as Daytripper and the second Magik. Fictional character biography Margali Szardos in her first panel ever, as she faces the X-Men and Dr. Strange in X-Men Annual #4, (1980). Art by John Romita Jr. & Bob McLeod. Margali Szardos' past is as much of an enigma as she is. She was supposedly born in Paris, France and taught magic by her mother, but she has yet to reveal her true origins. Margali's particular discipline of magic is called 'The Winding Way.' Uncanny X-Men Annual #4 Once having been married, Szardos has two children: Stefan and Jimaine (AKA Amanda Sefton). She supposedly had an affair with the demonic mutant Azazel who, at the time, had also seduced Mystique who was then posing as the wife of Baron Christian Wagner. The Baron, who was infertile, suspected his wife of infidelity and, when the pain of childbirth caused Mystique to shift back to her natural form and deliver a devilish-looking child, the locals rose up against mother and son. Mystique fled, throwing the child over a waterfall where he was later found and adopted by Margali. Whether she knew the child's origins or not, she raised the boy as her own.Excalibur #83 Working at Der Jahrmarkt as a fortune-teller to cover her tracks, Margali discovered that the Demon Belasco was sowing seeds of destruction into the Earth. She tricked her daughter into staying with her in Der Jahrmarkt by killing Sabu, Jimaine and Kurt's trapeze mentor. A day after Sabu's death, Kurt left Der Jahrmarkt to start a new life with the X-Men. Jimaine followed him to America and changed her name to Amanda Sefton, taking a job as a flight attendant. She and Kurt have since had an on-again, off- again relationship. Years later Margali learned that Kurt had killed Stefan. Too deep in grief to question why, Margali exiled Nightcrawler's soul to a dimension resembling Dante's Inferno. With help from Jimaine and Doctor Strange, Kurt was exonerated.Uncanny X-Men Annual #4 (1980) During Margali's time of weakness on The Winding Way, she was captured by the demon D'Spayre. After being rescued by Jimaine and Nightcrawler, Margali began her quest to take possession of a magical weapon called the Soulsword. Margali tricked her daughter once again by giving her a warning about a sorcerer called Gravemoss who was trying to kill all above him on The Winding Way. Amanda travelled to Muir Island and found that Gravemoss had possessed Kurt. After defeating Gravemoss, Amanda gave her mother the Soulsword and Margali used it to kill all the other sorcerers stationed above her. Amanda then joined Excalibur under the codename Daytripper. Hoping to release a demon under London, Margali joined the U.K. branch of the Hellfire Club as the Red Queen and kidnapped the mutant hybrid Douglock. Her efforts were foiled by Excalibur and Margali disappeared only to be captured by Belasco. With her last bit of magic she swapped souls with her daughter. Margali's soul, now in Amanda's body, took Nightcrawler to Limbo where they were able to rescue her body and defeat Belasco. After the battle, Nightcrawler returned to the X-Men and Margali left Amanda to rule Limbo. Amanda then took the name Magik for herself. Margali becomes the Red Queen Margali has reappeared recently to find Nightmare torturing her daughter. Nightmare was under control of a demon called Hive who was looking for the Soulsword. Nightcrawler was able to defeat Hive with the help of Margali, Jimaine and Nightmare. During the battle Margali revealed that Nightcrawler possessed the Soulsword. Nightcrawler currently keeps the Soulsword inside his body. Because of Margali's indiscriminate use of magic, she and Amanda parted ways on tense terms.Nightcrawler (2014) #2-#4. Following Nightcrawler's resurrectionAmazing X-Men (vol.2) #1-5. and his reunion with Amanda, Margali began to lust for the secrets of the afterlife. For this purpose, she engineered an attack by a quasi-robotic villain of her own creation called Trimega, pushing Nightcrawler into granting her sanctuary at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.Nightcrawler (2014) #1-#2. Once there, she attacked Storm and Beast, who had participated in Nightcrawler's recovery, converting their bodies into pictures of their memories. Stealing those memories relating to their experiences in the afterlife, she opened a portal into the Beyond. Intent on closing it from the other side, Nightcrawler and Amanda attempted to pass the gate, but Nightcrawler's voluntary exile from Heaven barred him from entry, stranding Amanda alone in the Void.Nightcrawler (2014) #4. Powers and abilities Margali is an accomplished sorceress, equal of almost any sorcerer on Earth, occupying \\"The Winding Way's\\" highest position. The Winding Way grants mystic power, but that power ebbs and flows unpredictably, affecting the strength of Margali's magic. Margali can cast spells and transform herself. As the Red Queen she manifested her magic as a flaming sword, could extend her nails into long talons, and fire blasts of red arcane energy. Upon her first meeting of Doctor Strange she summoned his Eye of Agamotto away from him against his will, a feat which made him consider that her powers could rival or dwarf his own. In other media Margali appears in the X-Men: Evolution episode \\"The Toad, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\". Along with her daughter, Amanda, her history and background from the comics is not represented, and is instead portrayed as a normal Gypsy woman. The only feature to remain from her comic background is her name, as said by her husband. She is voiced by Teryl Rothery.

Plot The memoir is about Simon's relationship with her sister Beth, who has an intellectual disability and who spends her days riding the fixed route buses in the city of Reading, Pennsylvania where she lives. Beth also lives independently, has a boyfriend named Jesse, and receives supports from two caring Direct Support Professionals, Vera and Olivia. Rachel is a busy writer and professor who loves her sister, but by the time they are in their late thirties, they've grown apart. When Beth asks Rachel to ride the buses with her for a year, Rachel reluctantly agrees. The book chronicles that year, during which Rachel befriends the bus drivers, Jesse, and Olivia, and learns about such key civil rights issues as self-determination and People- first language. The story in the present alternates with the story of the sisters' tumultuous family history, which also presents the struggles and pleasures of siblings of people with disabilities. Film adaptation In 2005, the book was adapted into a television film for CBS in which Rosie O'Donnell appears as Beth, a woman with an intellectual disability, who is dependent on her father. When her father dies, her sister, played by Andie MacDowell, comes to stay with her. At first, they fight about Beth's rampant consumption of junk food, resulting in bringing her cholesterol levels up, but after six months Rachel realizes that Beth is content with her life. Many aspects of the book were altered for the film. These include turning Rachel into a fashion photographer, eliminating an older sister and changing the name of the brother, and having the sisters' father die early in the story (whereas, in real life, he was still alive when the movie aired). The civil rights aspect of the story was also less explicit, the backstory was compressed, both characters were presented as more extreme than they are in the book, and several other characters were composites. Simon has said of the movie: \\"It's a poignant, moving, and powerful film. It also portrays both characters, as well as the struggles of the special sibling relationship, in a more realistic way than we usually get to see in film, and presents bus drivers as the everyday heroes that I now know them to be. In addition, the movie highlights some of the main themes from my book: Beth's right to live her life by her own choices, the importance of public transportation for a fully independent life, the essential need for friendships in the community, and the challenges and rewards of the sibling bond.\\"http://www.rachelsimon.com/faq.php#movie The film was directed by Anjelica Huston and filmed in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Riding the Bus With My Sister - The Movie - Interviews on YouTube =Cast= *Andie MacDowell - Rachel Simon *Rosie O'Donnell - Beth Simon *Richard T.

The game was also published in the United States under the original German title and under the name By Hook or Crook, and in the United Kingdom under the name Fair Means or Foul.  Gameplay  The players in the game represent the members of the pretentious Antique Club. Their goal in life is to have a better collection of old stuff than every other member in the club. There are two options every turn: 1) to the Auction House to bid on an antique, or 2) to a manor house to participate in a competitive exhibit. The outcome of the players' actions depends on the choices and card play of the other players in the same location. The game therefore includes a considerable bluffing component. The winner is the player to move the farthest on the board, or whoever finishes the fastest.

It is possible for tourists to visit the site by way of boat trips from local harbours or sightseeing flights from Oban Airport.  Topography  An aerial photograph, facing southwest, of the Gulf of Corryvreckan and its surroundings. The two islands to the top right are Jura (the larger one) and Scarba; the Gulf of Corryvreckan lies between them. Stretching off to the top left is the Sound of Jura. Strong Atlantic currents and unusual underwater topography conspire to produce a particularly intense tidal race in the Corryvreckan channel. As the flood tide enters the narrow area between the two islands it speeds up to and meets a variety of seabed features including a deep hole and a rising pinnacle. These features combine to create whirlpools, standing waves and a variety of other surface effects. The Corryvreckan is the third largest whirlpool in the world, and is on the northern side of the gulf, surrounding a pyramid-shaped basalt pinnacle that rises from depths of at its rounded top. Flood tides and inflow from the Firth of Lorne to the west can drive the waters of Corryvreckan to waves of more than , and the roar of the resulting maelstrom can be heard away. Although not, as is sometimes believed, formally classified by the Royal Navy as unnavigable, the nearby Grey Dogs, or Little Corryvreckan, are classified as such.The West Coast pilot stated for the Little Corryvreckan or Grey Dog \\"Passage conditions 7.260 – It is reported that the excessive rate of the tidal stream and the narrow width of the E entrance channel create an unnavigable area just S of Eilean a’ Bhealaich, an islet in the centre of the E entrance. As a result, it is inadvisable to pass through this channel, and even with local knowledge passage should only be attempted in quiet weather at slack water.'\\" The Admiralty's West Coast of Scotland Pilot guide to inshore waters calls it \\"very violent and dangerous\\" and says \\"no vessel should then attempt this passage without local knowledge\\". Experienced scuba divers who have explored the waters have described it as \\"potentially the most dangerous dive in Britain\\".  Mythology  In Scottish mythology the hag goddess of winter, Cailleach Bheur, uses the gulf to wash her great plaid, and this ushers in the turn of the seasons from autumn to winter. As winter approaches, she uses the gulf as her washtub, and it is said the roar of the coming tempest can be heard from as far away as , lasting for a period of three days. When she is finished with the washing, the cloth is pure white, and becomes the blanket of snow that covers the land. The Cailleach occupying the whirlpool was described as \\"the fiercest of the Highland storm kelpies\\" by Alasdair Alpin MacGregor. Another legend surrounds Norse king Breacan. In various stories, Breacan moored his boat near the whirlpool to impress a local princess, or alternatively to flee from his father across the gulf. In both stories Breacan was swept into the whirlpool, and his body dragged ashore later by his dog. Breacan may be named after the whirlpool, or its current name may be a Gaelic pun on his name. Charles Mackay's poem \\"The Kelpie of Corrievreckan\\" tells the story of a young woman who leaves her lover for a sea kelpie. She discovers too late that the kelpie lives at the bottom of the sea and she is drowned, \\"an awful warning to all fickle maidens\\". The words were adapted and set to music for piano and orchestra by Learmont Drysdale in the 1890s, and in 1939 Ruth Gipps set the poem to music for clarinet and piano. History Writing in the 7th century Adamnan called Corryvreckan \\"Charybdis Brecani\\". In Adomnan of Iona's 'Life of St Columba', the saint supposedly has miraculous knowledge of a particular bishop who ran into the 'whirlpool of Corryvreckan'. However, Adomnan says that this whirlpool was near Rathlin Island, suggesting perhaps either his geography was mistaken (although several other Irish sources of that time period agreed with Adomnan), or alternatively that originally a different place was known as the whirlpool of Corryvreckan and later ages gave this name to the current Corryvreckan, perhaps believing it was the one that Adomnan and others had written about in the 8th century.Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin Books, 1995 Adomnan wrote: > [15] Of the peril of the holy bishop Cólman moccu Sailni in the sea near > Rathlin island: Likewise, another day, while St Columba was in his mother > church, he suddenly smiled and called out: \\"Cólman mac Beognai has set sail > to come here, and is now in great danger in the surging tides of the > whirlpool of Corryvreckan.

Yet the Lord terrifies him > in this way, not so that the ship in which he sits should be overwhelmed and > wrecked by the waves, but rather to rouse him to pray more fervently that he > may sail through the peril and reach us here.\\" In 1549, Dean Monro wrote of \\"Skarbay\\" that between it and \\"Duray\\": \\"ther runnes ane streame, above the power of all sailing and rowing, with infinit dangers, callit Corybrekan. This stream is aught myle lang, quhilk may not be hantit bot be certain tyds.\\"Monro (1594) \\"Skarbay\\" No. 16.

Modern cultural references  Part of Powell's and Pressburger's 1945 film I Know Where I'm Going! was set at Corryvreckan. They filmed in Corryvreckan and the nearby (but less fierce) waters at Bealach a’ Choin Ghlais (\\"the pass of the grey dog\\"). The footage obtained there was then used in back projections with the actors in a replica boat rocked on gimbals while buckets of water were thrown at them. Model shots of the whirlpool were made to give a medium view of the boat being drawn into Corryvreckan. In mid- August 1947 the author George Orwell nearly drowned in the Corryvreckan whirlpool.\\"The masterpiece that killed George Orwell\\" The Observer. 10 May 2009Taylor, D.J. (2003). Orwell: The Life. London: Chatto & Windus. pp. 385–7. Seeking to focus his main energies on completing a novel destined to become the dystopian classic Nineteen Eighty-Four, Orwell had fled the distractions of London in April 1947 and taken up temporary residence on the isolated island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides. On the return leg of an August boating day trip to nearby Glengarrisdale, Orwell seems to have misread the local tide tables and steered into rough seas that drove his boat near to the whirlpool. When the boat’s small engine suddenly sheared off from its mounts and dropped into the sea, Orwell's party resorted to oars and was saved from drowning only when the whirlpool began to recede and the group managed to paddle the distressed craft to a rocky outcrop about distant from the Jura coastline. The boat capsized as the group tried to disembark, leaving Orwell, his two companions, and his three-year-old son stranded on the uninhabited outcrop with no supplies or means of escape. They were rescued only when passing lobstermen noticed a fire the party had lit in an effort to keep warm.Taylor, Supra. Orwell completed a first draft of Nineteen Eighty-Four about three months after the Corryvreckan incident, with the final manuscript not finished until late 1948.

Formed on 3 December 1918, they took their name from the month of the German Revolution. The group was led by Max Pechstein and César Klein. Linked less by their styles of art than by shared socialist values, the group campaigned for radical artists to have a greater say in such issues as the organisation of art schools, and new laws around the arts. The group merged in December 1918 with Arbeitsrat für Kunst (Workers Council of the arts – or 'The Art Soviet'). Weimar Republic Preparation for the opening of the , June 1924 The artists of the November group described themselves as radical and revolutionary. Their work, like that of the similar Arbeitsrat für Kunst, aimed to support a socialist revolution in Germany. A key objective of the group was the union of art and the people. Furthermore, the group tried to influence public and cultural aspects of society. In 1921, artists from the left wing of the November Group called for an end to the \\"bourgeois development\\" of the artists. The declaration was signed by Otto Dix, George Grosz, Raoul Hausmann, John Heartfield, Hannah Höch, Rudolf Schlichter and Georg Scholz. In 1922, the decentralised November Group restructured away from a conglomeration of local groups and became part of the \\"Cartel of advanced artistic groups in Germany\\" (Kartell fortschrittlicher Künstlergruppen in Deutschland). A synthesis of styles is a characteristic of the group, often referred to as cubo-futo-expressionism (Kubofutoexpressionismus), but really the group had quite disparate output which makes classification rather problematic. As well as painters, there were many artists from other disciplines such as architecture and music. The musicians became one of the driving forces under their leader Max Butting (later replaced by Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt). The November Group held regular art festivals, costume parties, studio visits, literary and musical events. Founding members The group was initially founded mainly by painters Max Pechstein, Georg Tappert, César Klein, Moriz Melzer and Heinrich Richter. At the first meeting on 3 December 1918 they were joined by Karl Jakob Hirsch, Bernhard Hasler, Richard Janthur, Rudolf Bauer, Bruno Krauskopf, Otto Freundlich, Wilhelm Schmid, the sculptor Rudolf Belling and the architect Erich Mendelsohn. From this group the first working committee were drawn. Members A definitive list of all the members of the group is difficult to establish due to a lack of early documentation. However, one of the exhibition catalogues, which was published in 1925, shows the following list of names: *Lou Albert-Lasard *George Antheil Rudolf Belling * *Max Butting *Carel Willink *Heinrich Maria Davringhausen *Walter Dexel *Christof Drexel *Hanns Eisler *Viking Eggeling *Conrad Felixmüller *Lyonel Feininger *Otto Freundlich *Paul Gosch *Otto Griebel *Gustav Havemann * *Wilhelm Heckrot Hannah Höch * *Jascha Horenstein *Philipp Jarnach * *Wassily Kandinsky *Bernhard Klein *César Klein *Fritz Klein *Issai Kulvianski *Otto Lange *El Lissitzky * * Thilo Maatsch *Ewald Mataré * *Carlo Mense *Hilla von Rebay *Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Georg Muche * *Laszlo Peri *Felix Petyrek *Enrico Prampolini *Kurt Hermann Rosenberg *Hans Scharoun * *Arthur Segal *Rudolf Schlichter *Wilhelm Schmid *Heinrich Stegemann *Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt *Georg Tappert *Bruno Taut *Heinz Tiessen *Wladimir Rudolfowitsch Vogel *Kurt Weill *Gert Wollheim *Stefan Wolpe *Niko Wassiliew *Walter Spies.

Freedomites began to divide from Doukhobors in 1902 in Saskatchewan, Canada, self-named as \\"God's people\\" and Svobodniki (Russian: \\"sovereign people\\"). The zealous faction, later called \\"Freedomites\\", opposed land ownership, public schools, using work animals, etc. and are mainly known for protesting nude, later for burning and bombing. By 1920 the common English term for the zealots became Sons of Freedom. Too often the zealots were mistakenly identified in the press as Doukhobors. By 1908 Doukhobors in Canada began to divide into \\"Community\\" and \\"Independent\\" Doukhobors. The \\"Community\\" mostly followed leader Peter V. Verigin to purchased land in the Kootenay and Boundary Districts of British Columbia. \\"Independents\\" remained in Saskatchewan, registered their own land, attended public schools, and obtained citizenship. Freedomites lived near and protested against both divisions of Doukhobors, hence the identity confusion. Of about 20,000 active Doukhobors in Canada today, ancestors of about 2,500 were Freedomites,F.M. Mealing (1976), Sons-Of-Freedom Songs in English Canadian Journal for Traditional Music. of which very few today identify with or practice zealous protesting, and many joined the USCC Community Doukhobors. Confusion that Freedomites were Doukhobors arose because all moved to Canada together to escape religious persecution in Russia, and seek land and freedom. A few, unsatisfied with broken promises by the Canadian government, attempted to trek back to Russia, and called followers of their break away movement Svobodniki (translated as Freedomite in the press). Journalists rushed to the story when some protested nude, but mistakenly mixed the terms Freedomites with the law abiding Doukhobors, falsely implying that different groups were one group.  Doctrine  Freedomite meetings were similar to other spiritual Christian folk-Protestants from Russia. They met in simple buildings, sat on benches, prayed in Russian, sang religious hymns and songs in Russian, and spoke about matters of religious and community interest mostly in Russian. The ideals of the Freedomites emphasized basic traditional Russian communal living and action — growing food, building homes, living a peaceful rural life, ecstatic religious doctrine when agitated for protest, and anarchic attitudes towards external regulation.  Public protest  Although Canada at first provided a more tolerant religious environment than the Russian Empire, conflict soon developed, most importantly over the schooling of children and land registration. These Svobodniki generally refused to send their children to government-run schools. The governments of Saskatchewan and later British Columbia did not heed reports by sociologists to appease the concerns of parents, and chose to legally charge many of the parents for not sending the children to school. Nude protest, 1900s photograph, 20+ years before naming their group \\"Sons of Freedom\\" The Svobodniki became famous for various public protests—sometimes publicly burning their own money and possessions and parading nude in public. There was a doctrinal justification for nudity: that human skin, as God's creation, was more perfect than clothes, the imperfect work of human hands. The public nudity has generally been interpreted as a form of protest against the materialist tendencies of society. A small minority of the Freedomites were noted for their arson campaigns, as a protest against materialistic life. They targeted belongings and other material possessions. The attacks occurred throughout the 20th century, but the periods of greatest activity were during the 1920s and 1960s. Both arson and bombing were used. The first use of explosives occurred in 1923, and two were killed by their own bombs in 1958 and 1962. Targets included their own property and unfortunate Doukhobor neighbors to further exhibit their loathing of materialism, attacks on schools to resist government pressure to school Svobodnik children, and attacks on transportation and communications. One such incident was the bombing of a railway bridge in Nelson, British Columbia in 1961. Most of these acts were committed in the nude. Among the reactions of the British Columbia and Canadian government was taking away Freedomite children and placing them in an internment center in New Denver. Abuse of these children was later alleged, and a formal apology demanded. The BC government made an official Statement of Regret that satisfied some, but not others. The Government of Canada has not apologized for its role in the removal, saying that it is not responsible for actions taken by the government in place 50 years ago.  Operation Snatch: timeline of actions taken  Between 1953 and 1959, roughly 200 Sons of Freedom (Freedomite) children, aged 7–15, were seized by the BC government, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and the federal government in \\"Operation Snatch\\". These children were confined in New Denver, BC in a prison-like setting. The Sons of Freedom children lost their human rights throughout their imprisonment by the BC government. The following is a timeline of the actions that were taken leading up to, during, and after the confinement of the children. * 1952. Newly elected Social Credit government led by W. A. C. Bennett begins to take a tougher stance on the misnamed \\"Doukhobor Problem\\". :Meanwhile, a report by the University of British Columbia is released, discouraging the seizure of the Sons of Freedom children. * 1953. The conservative Social Credit government is determined to end the \\"disorder\\" caused by the radical Sons of Freedom. :A new law, the British Columbia School Act made state-run education for all children mandatory. Shortly thereafter, the government began shipping students to residential schools. * September 9, 1953. The RCMP arrests 148 adults for parading nude near a school. They are taken to Vancouver, convicted, and sentenced to terms in the Oakalla prison. :104 children are taken by bus to a residential school in New Denver. * January 18, 1955. The RCMP put \\"Operation Krestova\\", into action and raided the Village of Krestova. :Operation Krestova is declared a success as 70 policemen removed 40 children from their homes. The number of children in the New Denver school is increased to 72. The Department of Health would only approve a maximum of 45-50 children. * 1955. The government considers applying the Protection of Children Act to the Sons of Freedom children. This would allow the children to be held in New Denver until they reached 18 years of age, for being truant from school. * January 6, 1956. Five members of the RCMP are sent searching for truant children pursuant to a search warrant. * May 1956. It is recommended that family visits to the school be reduced to one hour every three months by only two family members. * July 1956. A second director takes over as head of New Denver School, a fence is put up around the grounds. Visits with parents are conducted through the fence as RCMP patrol the grounds during the visits. *1956: Doukhobors in BC regain the right to vote in provincial and federal elections. *1958. One Son of Freedom killed by his own bomb * July 31, 1959. Parents are compelled to swear before a magistrate to send their children to school. * August 2, 1959. The remaining 77 children in New Denver are released. * 1956 to 1959. A review of the director's monthly notes reveals that punishment was given on many occasions in the form of lost family visits. *1959–1962: Freedomites destroy the property of the Community and Independent Doukhobors, the Canadian Pacific Railway, and public buildings. Hundreds of Freedomites are arrested and jailed during this time. *1961: Doukhobors in BC are able to buy back their land from the provincial government. Buy-backs were restricted to individuals who were not part of a commune. *1962. One Son of Freedom was killed by his own bomb *1962: Sons of Freedom from the town of Krestova, make their way to Vancouver to raise public awareness and in protest of the arrest of their supporters for arson and bombings. :The BC Civil Liberties Association is launched, based on the human rights concerns about their treatment by the government. *1964–1984: The Doukhobors are the primary organizers for many of the anti-war and anti-arms demonstrations in Canada, as well as a 50,000 kilometre \\"Peace and Friendship Caravan International\\" from BC to the USSR. *1971: A new policy of multiculturalism is announced by the Government of Canada. The intention is to commemorate and to recognize the diversity of Canadians. : A replica of the Doukhobor community home near Castlegar, BC has been completed by the Kootenay Doukhobor Historical Society. * 1975: Following the destruction of the Union of Spiritual Communities of Christ Community Centre in Grand Forks, the USCC opens a new community centre in Grand Forks. :The Freedomites were suspected of setting fire to the USCC Community Centre. * 1980: Official opening of the National Doukhobor Heritage Village in Verigin, Saskatchewan, centred on the dom or community home built for Peter V. Verigin. * 1982–1986: After 40 years of bombings and arson by the Sons of Freedom, the BC government organizes the Expanded Kootenay Committee on Intergroup Relations. It brings together representatives of various Doukhobor groups, governmental departments, and police. * 1999. An ombudsman's report is released. It called for an apology that was unconditional, clear, and public. It also listed other recommendations for reconciliation. Shortly thereafter, the government starts to formulate a response, deciding that all legal suits that were asking for compensation for abuse be sent straight to the courts. None of these lawsuits was successful. *March 2000:The Law Commission of Canada completed an extensive study on institutional child abuse in Canada, producing a final report entitled \\"Restoring Dignity\\". :The Law Commission of Canada recommended that the provincial and federal governments correct the historical wrongs, in the best interests of Canadian society. * October 2004. Members of the New Denver Survivors Collective attended the British Columbia Legislature, believing they would finally be granted an apology. Instead, Geoff Plant delivers a \\"statement of regret\\" on behalf of the BC government.  Operation Snatch: additional information  When the government made a decision to seize the Sons of Freedom children, it was in an attempt to respond to the widespread civil disorder happening in the Kootenays. The Federal Department of Justice faced two problems with the apprehension and conviction of the Sons of Freedom: where should the adult convicts be confined and what should be done with their children? In the years leading up to the creation of the residential schools, the Sons of Freedom had become a concern for the province of British Columbia as a whole; they seemed to have a problem with any sort of government, in addition to the laws and policies that were being enforced. Public and Authorities were unhappy because the Sons of Freedom did not register their births, deaths or marriages that occurred within their communities; nor did they send their children to public schools. Public alarm was increasing, based on the fears that the unruly incidents of nude protests, burning of homes and buildings and bombings of bridges and railways, were not being attended to by the RCMP. \\"It was between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. and Elsie Ericson's mother had just begun lighting the stove when four RCMP officers barged into their tiny wooden home in the village of Krestova, B.C. The child jumped out of bed and hid under it, only to be dragged out by their feet. Elsie and her brother spent the next four years in what she said felt like a jail. They were housed with nearly 200 other in a residential school in New Denver, B.C.\\" See also * Florence Storgoff * Mountain Institution * Doukhobor  References  Further reading  * Doukhobor Geaneology Website * New Denver Survivors * Great Unsolved Mysteries in Canadian History-Explosion on the Kettle Valley Line: The Death of Peter Verigin * Doukhobors/Sons of Freedom in French * CBC News: Doukhobor survivors want apology from B.C. * Attorney General's Statement of Regret to Sons of Freedom Doukhobor Children * Ombudsman: Province Of British Columbia Righting the Wrong: The Confinement of the Sons of Freedom Doukhobor Children: Public Report No. 38 to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia * BC Ombudsman's report questioning the Attorney General's \\"apology\\" * CBC Archives: Doukhobor bomb blast ignites fear in the Kootenays * Global News: 16:9 - Lost Childhood * Spirit Wrestlers, Jim Hamm Productions, 2002 documentary video and DVD about the Freedomite Doukhobors. * Doukhobors want apology from B.C. government * Righting the wrong: The confinement of the sons of freedom Doukhobor children External links *Records of Piers Island “Sons of Freedom” Imprisonment Collection are held by Simon Fraser University's Special Collections and Rare Books Category:Boundary Country Category:Christian radicalism Category:Doukhobors Category:History of British Columbia Category:Religion in the Pacific Northwest Category:West Kootenay ","title":"Freedomites"},{"id":"2467914","text":"Zagrebačka pivovara (lit. Zagreb Brewery) was founded in 1892, when brewers from the Upper Town of Zagreb realized they were not able to produce enough beer for the ever-growing and developing city. It was the first industrial brewery in Croatia. Today, it is the largest beer manufacturer in Croatia, holding 44% of the market in 2017.https://www.tportal.hr/biznis/clanak/zagrebacka-pivovara-drzi-44-posto- trzista-20170804 History The founding assembly of Zagrebačka pivovara as a joint-stock company was held on May 19, 1892, in the premises of the Croatian Discount Bank at the Ban Jelačić Square. The main initiators of the construction of a new facility were count Gustav Pongratz and baron Petar Dragutin Turković. Shortly after the convention, construction in Gornja Ilica began under supervision of Janko Grahor, based on plans made by architect Kuno Waidmann. The opening ceremony was held on July 12, 1893. This special event attracted thousands of citizens eager to see the new premises. The brewery was equipped with the Habermann cooling system, a 110 volts dynamo machine, two boilers with volume of 64 cubic litres and was illuminated by electrical lights fifteen years before it was introduced in the rest of the city. With good lighting and a big roof, the brewery quickly became one of Zagreb's most notable sights, and a place where citizens felt comfortable. Due to its 120-year-old tradition of committing to production of good-quality beer, Zagrebačka pivovara has earned the title of the largest brewery in Croatia. Its commitment to beer has been affirmed by its business achievements and its position as the leading brewery in Croatia. Since June 2012, Zagrebačka pivovara has been a part of the Molson Coors group within the Molson Coors Europe business unit. Products In 1893, Zagrebačka pivovara began producing the today’s best-selling beer in Croatia, Ožujsko pivo. Today, it produces a variety of beer brands: * Ožujsko pivo * Ožujsko Rezano * Ožujsko Cool - non-alcoholic beer * Ožujsko lemon and Ožujsko grapefruit - refreshing flavoured beermix * Tomislav - dark royal beer * Božićno pivo - special winter beer with an artistic spirit * Nikšićko pivo * Beck’s - the legendary German premium beer * Stella Artois - noble premium beer * Staropramen & Staropramen Selection - exceptional Czech beer * Carling - leading British beer * Corona * Leffe and Hoegaarden - special Belgian beers * Löwenbräu - German beer * Branik - Czech beer ReferencesFurther reading * https://www.zse.hr/userdocsimages/prospekti/ZAPI-prospekt.pdf External links * Zagrebačka pivovara homepage (Croatian language) Category:Beer in Croatia Category:Companies based in Zagreb Category:Food and drink companies established in 1892 Category:1892 establishments in Croatia Category:Molson Coors Beverage Company Category:Drink companies of Croatia ","title":"Zagrebačka pivovara"},{"id":"2467928","text":"The Toronto Public Space Committee (TPSC) is a volunteer-run, non-profit organization located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada that defends the city’s public space from corporate and private forces, including cars and outdoor advertising.

In recent years, the committee has formed various campaigns that aim to educate and lobby citizens, bureaucrats and politicians on matters such as anti-postering bylaws, tree protection, mobile (or truck) advertising, TTC subway video ads, and billboard advertising. Other campaigns the TPSC spearheads are less political, but stay true to public-space advocacy.

Church The Norman church, dedicated to St. Peter, built on the unusual basilica model with four, rather than three chambers. The church's foundations are thought to go back to 786, and parts of the Saxon walls can be seen in the sanctuary. The original stone altar is in place, dating back to well before the Reformation. The modern spire is made of fibreglass and was, for a time, the tallest fibreglass spire in the country.

The sulfite is used in essential biomolecules such as cysteine. The sulfonucleotide reductases are through to have all evolved from a common ancestor. The enzymes reduce adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate by nucleophilic attack to produce the sulfite product.

He is a former Maryland Terrapins point guard. College Arriving in College Park for the 2002–03 season, Gilchrist had a freshman campaign as a backup to then-Terp guards Drew Nicholas and Steve Blake. Following Blake's graduation, Gilchrist inherited the starting point guard position as a sophomore, leading the team in assists (5.0 pg), scoring (15.4 pg), minutes (34.0 pg), and steals (1.8 pg), while starting 30 of 32 games. For his efforts, Gilchrist was named the Terps' Co-Player of the Year. However, Gilchrist's true coming-out party would be the 2004 ACC Tournament. Having slipped to 7-9 in the ACC—the team's first sub-.500 conference record in more than a decade—Maryland was not as highly regarded as in years past and wound up as the tournament's 6th seed. However, the Terps ultimately upset the tournament's top three seeds, knocking off Wake Forest (3), NC State (2), and Duke (1), to win their first ACC Tournament title in 20 years. During this run, Gilchrist dazzled as the Terps' primary offensive option. First, Gilchrist hit the game-winning free throw against a Chris Paul-led Wake Forest team, scoring 16 points and shooting 4-for-4 from 3-point range. Next, Gilchrist led a 21-point comeback against the NC State Wolfpack, scoring 23 of his 30 points after halftime (and shooting 9-for-9 from the field); the 30-point performance was the first for a Terp since Juan Dixon scored 33 points against the Kansas Jayhawks in the 2002 NCAA Final Four. But Gilchrist was saving his best for last. In the tournament final against Duke—a team bound for the 2004 Final Four and loaded with six future NBA players—Gilchrist led the Terps back from a 12-point deficit with less than five minutes left in the game. Most dramatically, Gilchrist closed the 2nd half with a driving layup that drew a fifth and final foul on Shelden Williams, Duke's best low- post presence and Gilchrist's main competition for tournament MVP. Gilchrist's ensuing foul shot would tie the game at 77 with 20 seconds left, and Maryland went on to dominate the overtime and secure a 95-87 victory. For his three-day heroics, Gilchrist was unanimously named tournament MVP. The win also snapped Duke's drive for a sixth consecutive ACC Tournament title, while propelling Maryland into the 2004 NCAA Tournament; though the Terps ultimately lost by a few points to Syracuse in the second round, the team was seen as an up-and- coming squad that had overachieved, despite its youth. However, Gilchrist's career at Maryland—and fans' and NBA scouts' glowing opinion of him—would never reach these heights again. Led by their junior point guard, the Terps entered the 2004-2005 season ranked in the top 15 in the nation, but would succumb to road struggles and a late season collapse to again finish 7-9 in the conference. Nor could the team summon 2004's magic in the 2005 ACC Tournament; the Terps lost in the first round to Clemson, the third time the Tigers defeated the Terps that year. With a middling 16-12 record, Maryland missed the NCAA tournament for the first time in 13 years and accepted a consolation trip to the NIT, where they lost in the semifinals to South Carolina. Professional Despite having the physical tools (6 ft 3 in 194 lb.) of a solid NBA point guard and skills and athleticism that drew comparisons to an early Stephon Marbury, Gilchrist went undrafted, as most felt his mental maturity lagged far behind his physical maturity. He was invited to play in the Cleveland Cavaliers' summer league, but was not picked up by the team. =Maccabi Rishon LeZion, 2005-2006= In October 2005, he signed with the Maccabi Rishon Letzion, an Israeli pro team, he helped in leading his team to the Israeli Final Four where they finished in the 3rd place. =Pau-Ortez, Ironi Nahariya and NBDL, 2006-2007= In the summer of 2006 Gilchrist signed with the Euroleague French team Pau Orthez but was released shortly and moved back to Israel, to Ironi Naharia. Gilchrist remained inconsistent during the season, and was again released in January 2007. Gilchrist was picked up as the 66th pick in the 5th round by the Los Angeles D-Fenders in the NBDL (NBA development league) in February 2007. John Gilchrist played for the D-Fenders through March, then moved to the Idaho Stampede (another NBDL team) in April. =Latvia and return to Ironi Nahariya, 2007-2008= In August 2007 Gilchrist signed one-year contract with Latvian runners-up BK Ventspils, but in November 2007 was released.

History The Stad Amsterdam, the flagship of SAIL Amsterdam 2010 The event was organised for the first time in 1975 to celebrate the 700th anniversary of Amsterdam, under the name 'Sail Amsterdam 700'.

There were also several ship replicas, hundreds of classical sail- and steamships and some modern marine ships. For the first time several modern yachts and a submarine were present. The tall ships were moored in the IJhaven (IJ harbour) and in Amsterdam North (across 't IJ) and the Varend Erfgoed boats were moored in the nearby, where one can also find the Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum (a maritime museum) with its replica of a Dutch East India Company (VOC) ship, which is permanently moored there.

Background Sarjeant, who was from Capel-le-Ferne, near Folkestone, Kent, went to Astor Secondary School in Dover. He was a member of the Scouts, becoming local patrol leader before leaving to join the Air Training Corps in 1978. In the ATC, Sarjeant won a marksman's badge, and he owned an air rifle. After leaving school in May 1980 with seven CSE passes, Sarjeant applied to join the Royal Marines but left after three months, claiming that officers bullied him. He also tried to join the Army but stayed only for two days of an induction course. After failed applications to join the police and the fire service, he worked at a zoo and at an arts centre in Folkestone. Under the Youth Training Scheme he worked at a youth centre in Hawkinge.Stewart Tendler, \\"The Queen's safety is being reviewed\\", The Times, 15 June 1981, p. 1. Friends reported that Sarjeant joined the Anti-Royalist Movement in October 1980. At the time of the incident at the Trooping the Colour, he was unemployed and living with his mother, while his father was working abroad. He tried unsuccessfully to find ammunition for his father's .455 Webley revolver, and to get a gun licence of his own, he joined a local gun club. Through mail order he paid £66.90 for two blank-firing replica Colt Python revolvers. In the run-up to the annual Trooping the Colour ceremony, Sarjeant sent letters to two magazines, one of which included a picture of him with his father's gun. He also sent a letter to Buckingham Palace which read \\"Your Majesty. Don't go to the Trooping the Colour ceremony because there is an assassin set up to kill you, waiting just outside the palace\\". The letter arrived on 16 June, three days after the ceremony. Trooping the Colour incident On 13 June 1981, Sarjeant joined the crowds for Trooping the Colour, finding a spot near the junction between The Mall and Horseguards Avenue. When the Queen came past riding her 19-year-old horse Burmese, Sarjeant quickly fired six blanks from his starting pistol. The horse was momentarily startled but the Queen brought it under control and was unharmed. Corporal Galloway of the Scots Guards seized Sarjeant and pulled him over the crowd control barriers, where Galloway and others disarmed and subdued him.Guard: I Saw Shots Being Fired At Queen, Sky News on-line, by Alastair Bruce, 11 June 2016, accessed 9 October 2016. Sarjeant told them, \\"I wanted to be famous. I wanted to be a somebody\\". The incident happened fifteen minutes after the Queen's departure from Buckingham Palace. Immediately the Sovereign's Escort was ordered by the Gold Stick-in-Waiting to \\"close up\\" around her. The Queen continued to Horse Guards Parade. Investigation In questioning, Sarjeant said he had been inspired by the assassination of John Lennon in December 1980,Stewart Tendler, \\"Treason case youth jailed five years\\", The Times, 15 September 1981, p. 1. and the attempts on the lives of Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II. In particular he noted the ease with which Mark David Chapman had become famous after killing Lennon. A friend said that at the time of John Hinckley, Jr.'s attempt on the life of President Reagan, Sarjeant had said \\"I would like to be the first one to take a pot shot at the Queen\\". The police found that Sarjeant had written \\"I am going to stun and mystify the world. I will become the most famous teenager in the world.\\" Investigations by psychiatrists found that Sarjeant did not have any abnormalities defined as treatable under the Mental Health Act 1959. Trial Sarjeant became the first person since 1966 to be prosecuted under the Treason Act 1842, and was brought to trial before the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane, on 14 September 1981. He pleaded guilty, and Lord Lane, in sentencing him to five years' imprisonment, said that \\"the public sense of outrage must be marked. You must be punished for the wicked thing you did\\". He was found guilty of an offence under Section Two of the Treason Act in that he \\"wilfully discharged at or near Her Majesty the Queen a gun with the intent to alarm or distress Her Majesty.\\" Sarjeant appealed against the length of the sentence, but the appeal was refused.\\"No Appeal For Queen's Attacker\\", The Times, 3 February 1982, p. 5.

Al-Jabbar played college football for the UCLA Bruins. He was drafted in the third round of the 1996 NFL Draft by the Miami Dolphins. He also played for the Cleveland Browns and Indianapolis Colts. College career Born in Los Angeles, al-Jabbar attended the University of California, Los Angeles, where he played for the Bruins from 1992 to 1995 under head coach Terry Donahue. He set the school record for rushing yards in a season and was named team MVP in consecutive years under the names 'Sharmon Shah' in 1994 and 'Karim Abdul-Jabbar' in 1995. He was a three-year letterman and two-year starter at UCLA. Despite leaving school with one season of eligibility remaining, he ranks third on the Bruins' all-time rushing list with 3,030 yards on 482 carries (5.2 avg.) with 26 touchdowns. He also added 36 receptions for 885 yards with 9 touchdown. Karim averaged 110.1 total yards per game in college and was the only player in school history (and seventh in Pac-10 annals) to rush for over 1,600 yards. Professional career Al-Jabbar was drafted in the third round of the 1996 NFL Draft by the Miami Dolphins, with whom he would play three and a half seasons. In his rookie year, he set many of the Dolphins' rookie records for rushing by a running back. He became only the second Dolphin to lead the team in rushing in each of his first two seasons in the league. In 1997, he led the NFL in total touchdowns with 16 and tied Denver Broncos running back Terrell Davis for the league lead with 15 rushing touchdowns. Afterwards his productivity decreased. In 1999, the Dolphins traded him to the Cleveland Browns for a sixth round draft pick in the 2000 NFL Draft; while he did put up some decent numbers, it was not enough to earn himself a contract extension. Name controversy In 1995, al-Jabar, a Muslim, was given the name \\"Karim Abdul-Jabbar\\" by his Imam. The new name he was given quickly garnered major attention upon his NFL debut. Some commentators mistakenly believed that he was the son of former basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who also attended UCLA (under the name Lew Alcindor) and who himself has a son named Kareem. He also wore number 33, the same number that the basketball player had worn. The name controversy was periodically spoofed on postgame recaps, such as in 1996 when Chris Berman of ESPN called an Abdul-Jabbar touchdown rush with an imitation of Marv Albert, who was famous for announcing basketball as well as football games. The controversy eventually led to the basketball player suing the football player in 1997. The lawsuit led to the football player changing his legal name to Abdul-Karim al-Jabbar.

There are two pubs in the village, a national school, a playschool and Catholic church. There is also one public house in Dromin. Whilst the Catholic Church remains in permanent use, the old Church of Ireland Church has been demolished and all that remains is the steeple and gable wall. The parish extends from Rathcannon in the south to Crean in the north. Athlacca is in a rural area where farming, although in decline, is still the biggest employer. Athlacca parishioners have included Jim Cregan, the former European athletics champion, and PP Hogan, champion horse trainer.

It was the first series to air on Sundays instead of Mondays. Metalder bears many similarities to Toei's Android Kikaider and Kikaider 01, particularly in its themes, characters, and the hero's costume design. The action footage of Superhuman-Machine Metalder was used for Saban Entertainment's live-action TV series VR Troopers. On February 21, 2007, Toei released the complete Superhuman-Machine Metalder TV series and the Superhuman-Machine Metalder film on a seven-disc DVD set. For distribution purposes, Toei refers to this television series as Metalder. Story In 1945, Dr. Ryūichirō Koga designed Metalder as a top-secret weapon for the Japanese Imperial Army for use in the Pacific War, modeling it after his late son, Second Sub-lieutenant Tatsuo Koga. However, the pacifistic Dr. Koga put Metalder to sleep in the Silver Caucus base and left for the United States to work for NASA. During the 42 years, Dr. Koga's former colleague Kunio Muraki became evil God Neros, the ruler of the Neros Empire which is notorious as a merchant of death. God Neros sends out his massive armies to kill Dr. Kōga, who learned of their organization and returned to Japan to activate Metalder. Koga desperately tries to activate his android creation, who he named Ryūsei Tsurugi, but the android is unable to understand what to do. In order to give Ryusei a \\"purpose\\", Koga runs out of the Silver Caucus base, allowing Neros' troops to kill him. Suddenly seeing his creator die, Ryūsei becomes shocked, and soon is beaten by Neros' troops. Ryūsei becomes fueled with rage, evoking the conversion to his true form, the android known as Metalder. After a brief battle with Coolgin (which he loses), Ryūsei goes onward, meeting future friend Mai Ougi. CharactersMetalder= is a \\"Choujinki\\", a powerful war android built by Dr. Koga at the end of World War II originally as a countermeasure against the Americans. He was hidden in a secret base of the Japanese Imperial Army until Dr. Koga activated him years later to fight the Neros Empire. His human guise, , is directly modeled after that of Dr. Koga's son Tatsuo of whom he lost during the war. Whenever his energies reach a peak from rage, with the cry , he transforms into his metallic form. Like Tatsuo, he loves music and plays the saxophone from time to time. His Reflection Circuit gave him the same feelings as humans and a sense of right and wrong. Powered by 'super-gravitational energy', his killing techniques include \\"Laser Arm\\", \\"G-Kick\\", \\"Metal Tornado\\" spinning kick, \\"Head Crash\\" ram, \\"Plasma Punch\\", \\"Metal Bomber\\" punching attack from above, and \\"1000 Hand Punch\\". At the end of the series he defeats God Neros but in the process, his super- gravitational energy is greatly damaged, as a result whenever he moves longer, he will explode and the world will be destroyed by its impact. With Kita's help, Metalder is spared from destruction but at the cost of his human form and his ability to fight as a Choujinki. =Allies= * is a robot dog that guards the Silver Carcass. He was built by Dr. Koga before Metalder as his \\"older brother\\". Capable of human speech, he repairs Metalder and runs the machines inside the Silver Carcass. Springer enjoys watching TV, particularly anime. * is a tomboyish camerawoman who works for the Weekly Up magazine. She is Metalder's first human friend and constant companion. * is an armored warrior with a large hammer named after the legendary Saitō Musashibō Benkei. Ben K wins the honor to hunt down Metalder after defeating Gebaros in the Ghost Bank. He secretly attacks Ryusei by throwing a hatchet at his leg. With an injured leg, Ryusei leaves Mai behind and retreats into the woods. Ben K has the advantage with his mighty hammer, but Metalder manages to store just enough power to destroy Ben K's helmet. However, despite Metalder's wish to kill him, he spares Ben K's life upon realizing he was a human. After that, Ben K abandons the Empire. He returns in Episode 13 to help Metalder save Hidouman's captives, the miner and his family. He is killed by the Shadow Light Fighters, whom he simultaneously defeats. Like the legend, Ben K dies standing with arrows in his body. *is an athlete dressed in blue-green tights and a silver mask resembling a Greek warrior. His outfit fits the theme of a scuba diver. He wields a scythe and chain in his right hand and a clawed gauntlet on his left hand. Barlock was a former decathlon athlete who sabotaged his rival's chance to enter the Olympics. After his rival commits suicide, he feels shame at his cowardice and seeks out challengers to prove himself. In Episode 8, he battles with Hedogross in the Ghost Bank for the chance to fight Metalder, but loses. He later appears and snags Hedogross' hostage to use as bait to draw Metalder into battle. He is defeated, but not destroyed by Metalder's Laser Arm attack. Redeemed by fighting honorably, he sacrifices himself by taking a tank blast that was meant for Metalder, and possibly the hostage, thus killing him. * is the only female Light Fighter. She's also special for working specifically and only in Coolgin's army. Originally seen as a slave like Wisdom, she proved to be a strong and brave fighter when she protected an exhausted fellow slave from Wogger's blows. Coolgin, having watched the altercation, was impressed by her combat skills and promoted her to Light Fighter. Before becoming a slave, she was a tennis player who was \\"recruited\\" by The Secretaries to work as a slave by rebuilding damaged robots for the Empire. She had a sister whom Metalder rescued and took to a hospital after the girl appeared injured to him. Once promoted, Wogger gave her a flat-bladed sword with which to battle, as well as the new name/title of Madonna and freedom from her slave rank. Also ala Wisdom, she faked being a damsel in distress on the beach, only to turn on and attack Metalder after he tried to help her. Metalder recognized her from her sister's picture and tried to talk some sense into her by telling her that her sister was alive, which caused her to leave the battle. She returned to Wogger after her battle with Metalder and Wogger implanted a device into her armor to help her in her next battle with him. In reality, unknown by her, it was a detonation device. She was then used a decoy, faking a needed rescue, only to be saved by Metalder, luring him into a trap. Once he discovered it was a trap, Metalder used his Laser Arm attack to destroy her weapon and with Springer's help, learned of the bomb in her armor and chucked it out of her before it could harm them. Upon learning that she had been used, and that Metalder was right all along, she attacked Wogger long enough for Metalder to escape. Afterwards, she left the Empire and with Metalder's help was reunited with her sister in the hospital. * is a peaceful robot with a Stradivarius violin. However, when this robot is upgraded and plays his violin, Metalder's circuits go haywire and seem to paralyze his suit. Rhapsody was originally an unranked and friendly robot, like the repair robots, before being upgraded/promoted by the Emperor. He battles Tagsky and Tagsron in the Ghost Bank and wins the chance to fight Metalder. In the battle with the brothers, he breaks both their weapons. Fighting Metalders, he is struck by Metalder's Laser Arm attack, which seems to turn him back into a peaceful violinist. This does not last, as Darbarbo soon appears and blasts him, causing him to fall over and explode. Both Metalder and the Neros Empire remember his memory and musical talents. In Episode 19, it is revealed that he has been rebuilt and is no longer at Fierce Fighter status. He appears when a little girl becomes lost inside the Ghost Bank. He manages to protect her from the other robots and mutants by hiding her behind his cape until Chuubo discovers them together. He also plays the little girl a song for which she gives him a flower. After helping Metalder and Top Gunder rescue the girl, he leaves the Empire. Rhapsody has decided to stay good and is last seen working for what appears to be a carnival/boardwalk by entertaining patrons with his musical talents. He appears again in Episode 31, still working as a peaceful carnival entertainer. *: A slave married to Hedogross, who later gives birth to Hedogross Jr. She has both a humanoid and a mutant form. When she first appears, in Episode 9, she gives her husband her earring to hold during battle. When he is destroyed, she plucks the earring from his remains and vows revenge on Metalder, getting her chance in Episode 12. She uses her human guise to portray a damsel in distress for Metalder to rescue before revealing her true form and attacking. She flees when her labor pains become too intense. Back at the lab, Metalder learns she is just a pregnant slave. He saves her from Galador, who attacked her because she failed to defeat Metalder and ruined their plan. After Metalder rescues her, he returns her earring which she dropped fighting him, and allows her to escape. Sometime before Episode 15, she bears Hedogross Jr. When Junior attacks Metalder, she becomes angry and informs him that Metalder had saved her life. She tries to steer her son away from the Empire, but in vain. Wisdom is later taken hostage by the Empire, but is rescued by her son. She helps both he and Metalder fight off the Empire before leaving the Neros Empire with him. * is the son of Hedogross and Wisdom. Junior is a green mutant with silver hair who could project three long claws on each hand. Like his father, Junior can dissolve into slime and takes human form like his mother. He first appears in Episode 12 in Wisdom's memory/imagination as a baby. In Episode 15 he is determined to exact revenge on Metalder for his father and wants to take his father's place. Junior is recruited by Galdos and given status after proving himself. He is assigned to kill Metalder by God Neros after thrashing numerous members of the Monster Army in the Ghost Bank. However, during mid-battle with the Metal Hero, Metalder saves him from falling off a cliff. Metalder tries to reason with him. After seeing his mother held hostage, Junior finally realizes God Neros is the true villain, and the two fight off Bridy, Gamadone, Damnen, Zakembor and the Shadow Light Fighters together. * is the end result of Geldring's attempt to revitalize his ranks. Originally a stray German Shepherd named George, he is captured by God Neros' secretaries and mutated into a member of the Monster Army via a special booth-looking machine. During the battle with Metalder, its memories are restored by the Saint Bernard belonging to Mai and Kita, who had earlier shown it kindness. When it refuses to follow orders and destroy Metalder, Geldring kills him by spraying him with toxic foam. * is a Grand Prix motorcyclist who was originally head of a motorcycle gang. He first appears in episode 16, where he meets Ryusei and Mai on a photo shoot for a new motorcycle magazine, and gets involved in the fighting. Calling himself the 'Neros Hunter', Kita saw himself as Mai's bodyguard and has feelings for her. Though Kita was willing to aide Ryusei's war against the Neros Empire, his efforts almost always result in a comedic or humiliating defeat. * is a soldier who initially serves the Robotic Warrior Army. Top Gunder is a lone gunman in black tights and a single red-eye who believes in fair play. He was built after the manga character Golgo 13. Though he originally intended to kill Metalder in a one- on-one fight, Top Gunder later gained respect for Metalder and became close allies with him. In Episode 33, a fake robotic Top Gunder was created to bait Metalder into a rescue, as the real Top Gunder had been captured by the armies of God Neros. The fake robot attacked Metalder shortly after being rescued, only to be shot and destroyed by the real Top Gunder when Crosslander exposed the deception. Also, in Episode 33, Top Gunder revealed that he, like Zargen, was capable of dreaming. He helped Metalder to bring down the Ghost Bank in Episodes 35–37, only to be killed by God Neros, who was in Coolgin's old armor. * is a leading authority in Robotic Engineering and the man who created Metalder. After World War II, Dr. Koga went to America and became a staff member at NASA. He returned to Japan when he learned of the existence of the Neros Empire and its ties to his past actions, prompting him to activate Metalder. Battered from Strobe's attempt on his life, Koga makes it to the base and activates the android from his rest. Soon after, in order to give Ryusei a sense of purpose, Koga allows himself to be killed by Chuubo and the Neros Empire members at the end of the first episode. * is Dr. Koga's only son, whom Metalder was modeled after. He died in October 1944 as the first member of the Kamikaze Special Attack Squads. He loved music and played the violin with the potential to be a great violinist. * (34–39) is Mai's father, who lives in Washington DC as a news reporter. As a favor to Mai, he investigates Dr. Koga's past and learns about God Neros' identity. In Episode 35, he is abducted by the Secretaries and taken to the Ghostbank. In Episode 36, he is brainwashed by God Neros and forced to wear the armor of the late Tagsky to battle Metalder. Shingo becomes free from the brainwashing when Metalder strikes him with his Laser Arm. =Neros Empire= The is the underbelly of the Corporation. Located at Shinjuku, it covertly controls all activities of the world's criminal organizations, including terrorists and finance. The Neros Empire's goal is world domination with economic and military might. The leaders meet at the Ghost Bank, a ring of gates containing key army officers surrounding God Neros' throne. The area enclosed by the gates and throne serves as both an arena and as a strategy room. Divided into four Units: Armored, Robotic Warrior, Monster and Armament. * is the leader of the Neros Empire. God Neros has a god complex and wants to rule the world through the arms market. His original identity is that of , a former technical major within the Japanese Army who assisted Dr. Koga in development of the Choujinki project. Testing on prisoners of war led to Muraki's arrest and supposed execution at Singapore, but he managed to fake his death by bribing prison officials. Muraki escapes to America where he joins several criminal syndicates, eventually killing their leaders off and stealing their riches. In addition, he undergoes plastic surgery to alter his appearance, making himself appear much more youthful than he really is. He then builds the Kirihara Konzern under the name of . As far as the public knows, Gozo is a philanthropist at the head of an international financial empire. When entering the Ghost Bank, Kirihara undergoes a grotesque transformation revealing his true cyborg form as God Neros. He has Coolgin switch places with him, faking his death and manages to kill Top Gunder. In battle, God Neros can throw a sword like a spear, sprout tentacles from his throne to electrocute and bind opponents, blast lasers from the sphere on his helmet, and create/blast electrical energy from his hands. God Neros was beheaded at the end of the series by Metalder with the Laser Arm attack. * and are Gozo's spies. They are as ruthless and cruel as their boss. S dresses in a black leotard and wears her hair tied behind her head. K has green leotards and lets her hair drape to the right side of her head. Both die in the collapse of the Ghost Bank, denied their attempt to escape by Coolgin in the guise of God Neros. * is a first- class strategist, swordsman and God Neros' second-in-command. Though confused by his master's fear for Koga, Coolgin realizes why when Metalder reveals himself. However, Coolgin manages to defeat Metalder with one sword attack during their first confrontation. Coolgin had another brief rematch with Metalder in the Ghost Bank in Episode 19, but Metalder escaped before they could finish. In Episode 26, he gained yet another chance to fight Metalder one-on-one, but lost. Underneath his mask, he looks exactly like Kirihara; the purpose is so that he can be God Neros' shadow to create confusion. When the Ghost Bank self-destructs in Episode 37, Metalder believes he has defeated God Neros, but Coolgin and God Neros had switched places shortly before the battle. Coolgin attempts to kill Metalder and Top Gunder by destroying the Ghost Bank, but this plan backfires as Coolgin finds himself bound to the throne by electrical tentacles. Unable to escape, Coolgin accepts his fate and perishes in the explosion. Coolgin reappears as a ghost in the final episode. When Metalder stabs his fiery life force, he vanishes forever. * is a silver robot with a golden gear on his forehead that fires beams, and yellow and black stripes on chest and forearm armor. He can also blast energy from his eyeslots, as well as blast missiles from his knuckles when he makes a fist. He is proud of his army and does not move away from it. He fights for his fellow robots and praises them at every turn. In Episode 11, he leads his fellow androids and the Armament Army in an effort to capture the escaped Bigwayne. In Episode 36, he loses to Metalder, though he manages to survive, even after Metalder knocks him into the water. In Episode 38, he returns and gains the ability to assume the forms and use the abilities of his troops, via Lortail's help. Valsky transforms into Gochak, Jars, Bigwayne, Crosslander, and Galdos. But despite being defeated by Metalder's Laser Arm and G-Kick attacks, Valsky seemed impressed by Metalder and made peace with him before he explodes. * is a green muscular beast with a skull-like head encased in a clear egg-shaped dome that resembles a mutant turtle. Geldring's other abilities include teleportation, shooting goo out of his fingers, producing electricity from his hands, breathing fire and releasing vine-like appendages from his mouth. He has the most opportunities to battle Metalder personally, but fails. His personality is dirty, treacherous, envious, cowardly, and accommodating. He frequently criticizes the other armies and often takes credit for work accomplished by his fellow mutants. In Episode 9, he teases and taunts Hedogross for his love of Wisdom and soon prompts the other mutants to do the same. In Episode 15, despite Hedogross Jr. fitting into his rank, he does not want the young mutant to represent the Monster Army. In Episode 32, he learns of a rare plant which enhances those who consume it with great power. He puts this newfound strength to use against Metalder, but does not realize the effect is temporary. He is presumably destroyed after this fight, by Metalder, when Metalder uses his Laser Arm. In this battle, Geldring reveals the ability to blast lasers from his eyes as well as breathe fire.

These two returned in Episode 23, during the Four Army relay race. Tagsron fights Metalder with the Shadow Light Fighters, in Episode 25, and is defeated by Metalder's Metal Tornado Move. Tagsky weeps at learning of his brother's defeat, and then seeks vengeance. Before he can do so, he is defeated after landing on a landmine in Episode 26. The two are shown wearing their armor in the background of the Ghost Bank during Episode 27 (these warriors are either different from those seen before or perhaps this episode aired out of order). Although Tagsky is killed earlier, his armor is given to Mai's brainwashed father to wear in Episode 36. Tagsky's armor is scrapped afterwards. is a Samurai-like master of the katana and the hook. He led FuuFuuChu, Mukimukiman, Wogger, Gebaros, and Zakembor into killing Dr. Koga and fights Metalder in his first battle.

In battle, he discharges electrical energy from the tip of his spear, as well as manipulates enough wind to generate a sandstorm. He imprisons Metalder in a deep ditch by using this sandstorm attack, and tries to bury him alive, with the help of some projecting and imprisoning bars. After escaping from the trap, Metalder uses one of the bars as a weapon and causes Wogger to lose his footing. In a classic feint, he calls out to Metalder for assistance. When Metalder approaches him, Wogger unleashes more aggressive attacks, until Metalder realizes he was a lost cause and uses his Laser Arm attack to slice Wogger in half. In Episode 27, Wogger II first appears. He is summoned to lead the hunt for a triad of biological experiments called Gorigons which had escaped from the Ghost Bank. He is defeated by Metalder during the hunt, when Metalder uses his Metal Tornado Move on him.

He also obtains a handgun custom-made for battling Metalder. Crosslander loses his first encounter with Top Gunder, but in their second encounter, he defeats and damages the traitor. He originally wore a winged snake ornament on his forehead, but Metalder damaged it during their first encounter. His second, upgraded head is also damaged, this time by Top Gunder, even though it was equipped with a secret blaster that Top Gunder also damages.

His signature move is putting his opponents in headlocks and twisting their heads off, which he demonstrates to the Emperor, in the Ghost Bank, on Damnen. Metalder was losing in battle against him, but managed to gather his last bit of power to crack Gochak's face. Metalder snaps off Gochak's arms and tears off his head. After being beheaded, Gochak sprouted a cannon head. Metalder destroys Gochak for good with a Laser Arm, but collapses after the fight. Gochak was presumably rebuilt, as he reappears in Episode 11 when he tries to help the rebellious Bigwayne escape from the Robotic Warrior Army and the Armored Army.

Zargen's scheme to prevent that involves the public abduction of a scientist transporting a briefcase containing valuable information. Metalder takes the bait and retrieves the briefcase. The scientist was a fake, however, but the bomb inside the case fails to destroy Metalder. Before his next battle with Metalder, Zargen asks God Neros to implant him with an explosive device, in order to guarantee his victory. If Metalder struck him directly in close combat, the bomb would destroy them both. During the battle, he lodges his armblade into Metalder's right shoulder and attempts to finish the task with an electric discharge from the spikes on his head. To Zargen's surprise, Metalder severs his own arm to put distance between them. Metalder then throws his severed arm at Zargen's torso, triggering the bomb and destroying him. is a white-colored female robot.

Like allelopathy, it is a type of interference competition but it is technically different: autotoxicity contributes to intraspecific competition, whereas allelopathic effects refer to interspecific competition. Furthermore, autotoxic effects are always inhibitory, whereas allelopathic effects are not necessarily inhibitory–they may stimulate other organisms. This mechanism will result in reduced exploitative competition between members of the same species and may contribute to natural thinning in established communities. Inhibition of the growth of young plants will increase the availability of nutrients to older, established plants. In cultivation, autotoxicity can make it difficult or impossible to grow the same species after harvest of a crop. For example, this is known in alfalfa and the tree Cunninghamia lanceolata Other species displaying autotoxicity include the rush Juncus effusus and the grass Lolium rigidum. In alfalfa Autotoxicity in alfalfa is produced from the first seeding of the plant. The plant emits a chemical or chemicals into the soil that reduce the effectiveness of further alfalfa seedings. Studies show that the chemical is extractable from fresh alfalfa, is water-soluble, reduces germination, and prevents root growth.Understanding Autotoxicity in Alfalfa , John Jennings, Extension Forage Specialist, University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service Some believe that a chemical called medicarpin is responsible for autotoxicity. Roots of affected plants can be swollen, curled, discolored, and lack root hairs.

History It opened on 3 April 1876 on the Midland Railway's Birmingham West Suburban Railway branch to serve the burgeoning suburbs of Selly Oak and Bournbrook. On 20 August 1883, a goods train from Granville Street to Lifford was passing over the bridge over the canal at Selly Oak station when at a speed of it derailed and damaged much of the wooden railing of the bridge. The engine remained on the bridge, but two of the wagons broke through the wooden fencing and tumbled down the embankment. The station area has changed considerably since the Midland Railway days and lost virtually all its original features as the station was completely rebuilt by British Rail in 1978 to designs of the architect John Broome along with the others on this line when the Cross-City route was commissioned. Prior to the rebuild, the station had only received a limited service (mainly at peak hours) for much of the 1960s and 1970s. On 11 April 1993, a railway employee at the station was threatened with sticks and two masked men stole takings of hundreds of pounds. The station received a £85,000 () facelift in 1994 with the number of car park spaces expanded from 50 to 86, new lighting, fencing and closed circuit TV Station masters *Nathaniel Dottoms 1876 - 1877 *Mr. Viney 1877 - 1881 *W.G.

Skinner & Co., Ltd., Edinburgh, 1935 The earliest Moir of record was one Adam de la More. In 1213, King John of England sent Adam de la More to the King of Scotland with a gift of gyrfalcons. It looks as if he, and perhaps others of his name settled in Scotland. In the County of Rubislaw, Gilchrist More was one of the Barons who swore fidelity to Edward I in 1296. Gilcrist More is said to have incurred the wrath of Sir Walter Cumyn but later married his daughter and secured lands of Rowallan Castle near Kilmarnock in Ayershire. Gilcrist's granddaughter, Elizabeth Mure of Rowallan married the future King Robert II in 1346.http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/m/muir2.html The heiress of Polkellie, Janet More, in the time of David II married Sir Adam Muir of Rowalian.Andrew J.

Moir genealogy and collateral lines : with historical notes. unknown: The author, c1913. A century later, when the Laird of Rowallan gets a confirmation charter from King Robert the Third, he is designated Sir Adam More, Knight; but it is in the same year (1391) that the first transmuta- tion of the name takes place into \\"Mure,\\" in a charter of pension granted to the King's uncle Andrew Mure, he being a brother of Elizabeth More of Rowallan. After this date, the common spelling of the name is Muir or Mure.Moir, Alexander L.,. Moir genealogy and collateral lines : with historical notes. Union Printing Co, Lowell, MA,1913. Reginald (or Ranald) de la More was a Knight for Robert I of Scotland (Robert the Bruce). King Robert made de la More Chamberlain of Scotland in 1329. He held the office until his death in 1341. The Bruce gave his Chamberlain de la More considerable estates in various parts of Scotland, one being that of Abercorn in Linlithgow; another being the Thanage of Formartyn, which included a greater part of Aberdeenshire. One of the Chamberlain's sons was Sir William More of Abercorn, and another was Gilchrest More.Moir, Alexander L.,. Moir Genealogy and collateral lines : with historical notes. unknown: The author, Lowell, MA, 1913. Robert the Bruce and Reginald de la More were Templars when in 1307 King Phillippe le Bel of France arrested and had executed many Knights in Paris. Two years later the Pope excommunicated Robert the Bruce reportedly for murdering John Comyn in a Scottish church. The Pope then went on to excommunicate all of the Bruce's noblemen. Finally, the entire realm of Scotland went under papal interdict. The pope's actions left the Catholic churches of Scotland free to support the Templars. As a result, a substantial number of Knights sought refuge in Scotland. When Robert the Bruce died in 1329, having never served God on a Crusade, he left commands that his heart be taken on a Crusade. Sir Kenneth de la More (Kenneth Moir) in the spring of 1330 rode out with Sir James Douglas carrying the Bruce's heart encased in a silver casket locket on a chain. With them went Sir Simon Locard of Lee (Lockharts of Lee), Sir William Borthwick, Sir William de Keith, Sir William de St. Clair and his younger brother John of Rosslyn (eldest brothers of Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney), Sir Alan Cathcart (Clan Cathcart) and the brothers Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig and Sir Walter Logan (Clan Logan).Sir Herbert Maxwell, History of the House of Douglas II Vols., London 1902 Sir Kenneth stopped in Sluys, Flanders where they were joined by more Knights Templars. Alfonso XI of Castile sought assistance against the Muslims (Moors) of the kingdom of Granada led by Muhammed IV, Sultan of Granada. The Knights travelled 2,000 kilometers to Seville and offered their support to Alfonso for his Crusade to rid the Iberian Peninsula of non-Christians. On 25 August 1330 southeast of Seville in a saddle high above the river the Knights came to Teba in Andalusia. There, three thousand of Muhammed IV's cavalry made a feigned attack on the Christian. The great body of his army took a circuitous route to fall, unexpectedly, upon the rear of Alfonso's camp. With the Christian troops otherwise engaged, the Templar Knights face overwhelming odds. Templar Knights do not retreat and Sir James gave the order to charge. Sir James Douglass, Sir William St. Clair, Sir John de St. Clair, Sir Robert Logan and Sir Walter Logan died in battle. Sir Kenneth survived to oversee preparations for transport home of the fallen Templar Knights. This included the scrubbing clean of bones. He returned the Scottish Knights to their family homes. For his extraordinary bravery and for might when faced with overwhelming odds, Sir Kenneth was named Moir. Sir Simon Locard for returning the heart of the Bruce to Melrose Abbey was named Lockhart. Several Scottish- mainly Aberdeenshire- based- individuals of the name have been granted arms, common to all these being three detached Moors' heads dripping blood. This shared heraldic device indicates, notwithstanding a lack of established pedigree, recognition of the Moir family's crusading tradition.

The following year, Lacy married actress Frances Dalton Cooper (1819 - 1872) in that city; the couple also toured England together. Lacy's roles included Jacques (As You Like It) and Banquo (Macbeth). In the mid-1840s Lacy withdrew from the stage and set up a business as a theatrical bookseller in London, at first in Wellington Street, Covent Garden and, from 1857, at 89 Strand. He also ventured into publishing with an innovative approach to playscripts, producing acting editions of recent plays so that each actor could have a full script to work from. Lacy's Acting Edition of Plays, published between 1848 and 1873, eventually ran to 99 volumes containing 1,485 individual pieces. In 1859 he made the acquaintance of US entrepreneur Samuel French, who had started a similar publishing business in New York City five years earlier and was visiting London. Lacy and French became partners, each acting as the other's agent across the Atlantic. In 1872, French decided to take up permanent residence in London, and when Lacy retired without any immediate heirs in 1873, he sold out to French for five thousand pounds.

On May 26, 2005, the Jail Branch was the site of the drowning of three children, whose bodies were found in Barre at 5:45 a.m. local time. The drowning was attributed to the steep riverbank, which could have caused the children to slip and fall into the river.  The East Barre Dam  The East Barre Dam was built in response to the 1927 flood. The flood set state records and hit the Winooski River Valley and tributaries the hardest. Eighty-four people died as a result of the flood statewide, and the downtown of Barre was decimated from the flooding of the Jail Branch and Stevens Branch rivers.

The intent is adding some of the speed of SSDs to the cost-effective storage capacity of traditional HDDs. The purpose of the SSD in a hybrid drive is to act as a cache for the data stored on the HDD, improving the overall performance by keeping copies of the most frequently used data on the faster SSD. There are two main configurations for implementing hybrid drives: dual-drive hybrid systems and solid-state hybrid drives. In dual-drive hybrid systems, physically separate SSD and HDD devices are installed in the same computer, having the data placement optimization performed either manually by the end user, or automatically by the operating system through the creation of a \\"hybrid\\" logical device. In solid-state hybrid drives, SSD and HDD functionalities are built into a single piece of hardware, where data placement optimization is performed either entirely by the device (self- optimized mode), or through placement \\"hints\\" supplied by the operating system (host-hinted mode). Types A high-level comparison of SSHD and dual-drive or FCM designs There are two main \\"hybrid\\" storage technologies that combine NAND flash memory or SSDs, with the HDD technology: dual-drive hybrid systems and solid-state hybrid drives. =Dual-drive hybrid systems= Dual-drive hybrid systems combine the usage of separate SSD and HDD devices installed in the same computer. Overall performance optimizations are managed in one of three ways: # By the computer user, who manually places more frequently accessed data onto the faster drive. # By the computer's operating system software, which combines SSD and HDD into a single hybrid volume, providing an easier experience to the end-user. Examples of hybrid volumes implementations in operating systems are ZFS' \\"hybrid storage pools\\", bcache and dm-cache on Linux, and Apple's Fusion Drive and other Logical Volume Management based implementations on OS X. # By chipsets external to the individual storage drives. An example is the use of flash cache modules (FCMs). FCMs combine the use of separate SSD (usually an mSATA SSD module) and HDD components, while managing performance optimizations via host software, device drivers, or a combination of both. One example is Intel Smart Response Technology (SRT), which is implemented through a combination of certain Intel chipsets and Intel storage drivers, is the most common implementation of FCM hybrid systems today. What distinguished this dual-drive system from an SSHD system is that each drive maintains its ability to be addressed independently by the operating system if desired. =Solid-state hybrid drive= Solid-state hybrid drive (also known by the initialism SSHD) refers to products that incorporate a significant amount of NAND flash memory into a hard disk drive (HDD), resulting in a single, integrated device. The term SSHD is a more precise term than the more general hybrid drive, which has previously been used to describe SSHD devices and non-integrated combinations of solid-state drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives. The fundamental design principle behind SSHDs is to identify data elements that are most directly associated with performance (frequently accessed data, boot data, etc.) and store these data elements in the NAND flash memory. This has been shown to be effective in delivering significantly improved performance over the standard HDD. An example of an often confused dual-drive system being considered a SSHD is the use of laptops which combine separate SSD and HDD components into the same 2.5-inch HDD-size unit, while at the same time (unlike SSHDs) keeping these two components visible and accessible to the operating system as two distinct partitions. WD's Black2 drive is a typical example; the drive can either be used as a distinct SSD and HDD by partitioning it appropriately, or software can be used to automatically manage the SSD portion and present the drive to the user as a single large volume. Operation In the two forms of hybrid storage technologies (dual- drive hybrid systems and SSHDs), the goal is to combine HDD and a faster technology (often NAND flash memory) to provide a balance of improved performance and high-capacity storage availability. In general, this is achieved by placing \\"hot data\\", or data that is most directly associated with improved performance, on the \\"faster\\" part of the storage architecture. Making decisions about which data elements are prioritized for NAND flash memory is at the core of SSHD technology. Products offered by various vendors may achieve this through device firmware, through device drivers or through software modules and device drivers. =Modes of operation= ; Self-optimized mode :In this mode of operation, the SSHD works independently from the host operating system or host device drives to make all decisions related to identifying data that will be stored in NAND flash memory. This mode results in a storage product that appears and operates to a host system exactly as a traditional hard drive would. ; Host-optimized mode (or host-hinted mode) : In this mode of operation, the SSHD enables an extended set of SATA commands defined in the so-called Hybrid Information feature, introduced in version 3.2 of the Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO) standards for the SATA interface. Using these SATA commands, decisions about which data elements are placed in the NAND flash memory come from the host operating system, device drivers, file systems, or a combination of these host-level components. : Some of the specific features of SSHD drives, such as the host-hinted mode, require software support from the operating system. Microsoft added support for the host-hinted operation into Windows 8.1, while patches for the Linux kernel are available since October 2014, pending their inclusion into the Linux kernel mainline. History 1TB Seagate desktop SSHD ST1000DX001 Hybrid-drive technology has come a long way with modern implementations improving over the past decade beginning in 2007: * In 2007, Seagate and Samsung introduced the first hybrid drives with the Seagate Momentus PSD and Samsung SpinPoint MH80 products. Both models were 2.5-inch drives, featuring 128 MB or 256 MB NAND flash memory options. Seagate's Momentus PSD emphasized power efficiency for a better mobile experience and relied on Windows Vista's ReadyDrive. The products were not widely adopted. * In May 2010, Seagate introduced a new hybrid product called the Momentus XT and used the term solid-state hybrid drive. This product focused on delivering the combined benefits of hard drive capacity points with SSD-like performance. It shipped as a 500 GB HDD with 4 GB of integrated NAND flash memory. * In November 2011, Seagate introduced what they referred to as their second-generation SSHD, which increased the capacity to 750 GB and pushed the integrated NAND flash memory to 8 GB. * In March 2012, Seagate introduced their third-generation laptop SSHDs with two modelsa 500 GB and 1 TB, both with 8 GB of integrated NAND flash memory. * In September 2012, Toshiba announced its first SSHD, delivering SSD-like performance and responsiveness by combining 8 GB of Toshiba's own SLC NAND flash memory and innovative, self-learning algorithms with up to 1 TB of storage capacity. * In September 2012, Western Digital (WD) announced a hybrid technology platform pairing cost-effective MLC NAND flash memory with magnetic disks to deliver high-performance, large-capacity integrated storage systems. * In November 2012, Apple Inc. released the factory-configured dual-drive hybrid system named Fusion Drive. * In October 2015, TarDisk introduced the plug-and-play dual-drive hybrid system \\"TarDisk Pear\\", with flash memory size options up to 256 GB. Benchmarks Late 2011 and early 2012 benchmarks using an SSHD consisting of a 750 GB HDD and 8 GB of NAND cache found that SSHDs did not offer SSD performance on random read/write and sequential read/write, but were faster than HDDs for application startup and shutdown. The 2011 benchmark included loading an image of a system that had been used heavily, running many applications, to bypass the performance advantage of a freshly-installed system; it found in real-world tests that performance was much closer to an SSD than to a mechanical HDD. Different benchmark tests found the SSHD to be between an HDD and SSD, but usually significantly slower than an SSD. In the case of uncached random access performance (multiple 4 KB random reads and writes) the SSHD was no faster than a comparable HDD; there is advantage only with data that is cached. The author concluded that the SSHD drive was the best non-SSD type of drive by a significant margin, and that the larger the solid-state cache, the better the performance.

In 2003, Heineken International acquired a majority stake. Heineken Hrvatska has 329 employees, 12 brands and Karlovačko beer is enjoyed in 10 countries. The brewery's signature Karlovačko beer has an alcohol content of about 5.4 percent by volume. The brewery produces the following brands of beer: * Karlovačko light lager beer * Karlovačko crno beer * Karlovačko Radler limun *Karlovačko Leđero Natur Radler *Karlovačko 0.0% Max Awards Karlovačko light lager beer won many awards, and in September 2005, it won the gold medal in its category, the so-called beer Oscar at the prestigious Brewing Industry International Awards held in Munich. In 2012, Karlovačko received another award for quality, Monde Selection awarded by the International Institute for Quality Selections. Croatian barley for production of Karlovačko beer In July 2014, HEINEKEN Hrvatska has launched an initiative of Croatian barley for the production of Karlovačko beer. With this project, they have committed to use barley that is of Croatian origins, from Croatian fields. After signing the letter of intent for cooperation between project partners, the first Karlovačko beer with Croatian barley was launched on the market in February 2015. With this project, they wanted to ensure the sustainable domestic production of the key ingredient in order to influence the development and support of the local economy. Making responsible consumption aspirational HEINEKEN Hrvatska encourages responsible consumption of alcohol and by various campaigns aims at making it aspirational, at the same time promoting zero tolerance for underage drinking. They implement project “For Responsible Youth” and they wanted to contribute to raising awareness, educating the public on this issue, and to have a positive impact on young people. An initiative “I am 18+” was originally launched during Beer Days 2013, and was conducted again in 2015. At the event that was visited by thousands of beer lovers, the bracelets with the inscription “I’m 18+” were only handed out to adults with a valid ID. The bracelets helped waiters to easily identify minors and to avoid selling beer to them. 2007 incident On March 13, 2007, prosecutors in Karlovac County decided to launch an investigation against five executives of the brewery, as well as the company as a legal entity, on suspicion that the brewery dumped carbon dioxide waste into local stream Grabica. Previously, work at the brewery was ordered to a temporary halt in order to weigh possible action. On February 23, an elderly man named Zdravko Martinović fell comatose while walking his dog near the canal outside the brewery, after attempting to revive his dog, which died on the spot. He was found to have high levels of ammonia in his blood although this was later denied, and claimed that he was poisoned by carbon dioxide.

It ran from 1908 to 1940, publishing a total of 1683 issues. Each issue contained a long school story about the boys of Greyfriars School, a fictional public school located somewhere in Kent, and were written under the pen-name of Frank Richards. The vast majority of the stories were written by author Charles Hamilton, although substitute writers were sometimes used. Stanley James Rossiter-Shepherd wrote some substitute stories from 1921-1925. The most famous Greyfriars character was Billy Bunter, of the Remove. Most issues of The Magnet also included a shorter serial story (a variety of detective, scouting, and adventure yarns were featured), and many issues also included a newspaper ostensibly produced by the characters themselves and called the Greyfriars Herald. These parts of the paper were not written by Charles Hamilton.  History  The stories began in 1908, before the First World War, and continued through the privations of that war and the Great Depression of the 1930s that followed. The Magnet was aimed primarily at working-class boys who would never go to a public school themselves, hence part of the appeal of the stories was to portray the unattainable, which was not merely the public-school education itself, but also, in part, an affluent and well-fed lifestyle. = Red Magnet era – 1908–1915 = So called because of the colour of its cover in this period, it was created by an Amalgamated Press staff editor named Percy Griffiths, building on the success of the earlier boys' paper The Gem. These early years saw the creation of nearly all of the characters who would populate Greyfriars for the remainder of its history. = Blue and White era – 1915–1922 = The cover changed to blue and white, as a result of the unavailability of red dye due to the war. This era saw a profusion of stories written by authors other than Hamilton, one of whom was the editor J N Pentelow, the only substitute writer whose work was given preference over that of Hamilton. Wartime paper shortages reduced the length of each weekly issue. = Blue and Orange era – 1922–1937 = Blue and Orange covers were introduced, and a growing proportion of stories were written by Hamilton, as he came to see The Magnet as the main focus of his attention. By 1927 to 1930, only a handful of stories were the work of other writers. The last substitute story, \\"Speedway Coker\\" by M.F. Duffy, appeared in issue No.1220, published in July 1931; from then until the paper's end in 1940, Hamilton wrote every issue's Greyfriars story. The idea of a series of several linked stories appearing in consecutive issues started to dominate and become the key ingredient of this period, allowing increased complexity of plotting and stimulating finer writing. Most of the best remembered stories appeared in this period, including the Courtfield Cracksman, Methuselah, Lancaster, and Brander rebellion series, as well as several ambitious travel series to far away places such as India, China, South Seas, Egypt and East Africa, which its readers would never see, and in truth most of which Hamilton himself never saw, either, being hugely in demand as an author. Some Hamilton enthusiasts and scholars have suggested that the central years of this era represent a 'Golden Age', a sustained period that saw a consistently high standard in the quality of stories and series, occurring from the late 1920s to the early 1930s. Charles Hamilton himself agreed that his best work for The Magnet took place around this time. = Salmon Pink era – 1937–1940 = The use of long serials continued, albeit often recycling the plots of earlier years. The covers changed to salmon pink for the last four years. A decline in circulation, coupled with paper shortages, meant that The Magnet could not survive the Second World War. The final issue was the opening story in a new series; at least four other issues are known to have been already completed, but these were never published, and are now presumed lost. After closing, it 'merged' into the comic Knockout making Knockout Comic and The Magnet, in which the characters of Billy Bunter and Sexton Blake carried on appearing. = After closure = After 1940, new Greyfriars stories by Hamilton continued to appear in book form, published initially by Charles Skilton and later by Cassells, in a series which continued until Hamilton's death in 1961 (although some of the novels appeared posthumously even later); and in a television series, also written by Hamilton, which ran from 1951 to 1961 on the BBC. Some stories that had originally seen publication in The Magnet appeared during the mid-1960s, and as late as 1972, from Armada Books and from Paul Hamlyn. Furthermore, most of the 1,683 issues of The Magnet were reprinted in hardback form by publisher W Howard Baker, under his Howard Baker and Greyfriars Book Club imprints, between 1969 and 1990. Editors * Percy Griffiths – 1908–1911. Nicknamed 'Pushful Percy' owing to his dynamic character. He left Amalgamated Press suddenly in 1911, and nothing is known of his subsequent history. * Herbert Allen Hinton – 1911–1916. A military man who left to take up a wartime commission. * John Nix Pentelow 1916–1919 – A cricket authority and writer who took over when many of the editorial staff were occupied with the war. He contributed many stories himself on the pretext of a shortage in supply from Charles Hamilton and other writers. His writing is remembered for one story when an established character, Courtney of the Sixth Form, was killed off. * Herbert Allen Hinton - 1919-1921. He returned as editor but left rather abruptly in 1921, due to plagiarism of a Magnet story. * Charles Maurice Down – 1919–1940. A former public schoolboy, who conceived the idea of the very popular 'Holiday Annual'. Probably the editor with whom Charles Hamilton got along the best. The author in fact stated that many attributes of Mr Down could be discerned in the schoolboy character Arthur Augustus D'arcy, found in the other companion paper—the Gem story-paper. \\"Gussy\\", the character in question, had a kind heart, and was known for his sartorial elegance and many positive traits. Illustrators A large part of the appeal of The Magnet lay in the illustrations, of which there would typically be five per issue in addition to the cover. The illustrators were: * Hutton Mitchell – 1908. Produced the original drawings of Billy Bunter. His characters tended to be more prominent with the background detail kept to a minimum. He had a clear-cut style. * Arthur H. Clarke – 1908–1911. The second Magnet artist. Some consider his depiction of the schoolmasters a bit grim-looking and Victorian in appearance, and there was generally much of a sameness about his characters. However, his work was well up to standard. * C. H. Chapman – 1911–1940. First gave Bunter check trousers. In the beginning he was told to emulate the style of Arthur H. Clarke, but then came into his own during the early 1920s. Carried on illustrating Greyfriars stories after The Magnet closed. * Leonard Shields – 1926–1940. From his inception in the India series of 1926, and throughout the remainder of The Magnet (sharing some drawings with C. H. Chapman), illustrated some very fine drawings including very many covers.

World Youth Day is a celebration of faith begun by Pope John Paul II held on an international level every two to three years, and WYD2002 was the 10th such event. Although WYD is designed for Catholics, it attracts sizable numbers of youths from other faiths and denominations and was presented as a multi-faith celebration of young people from all over the world. As the event is ultimately an expression of faith, and a critical expression of faith is through service to others, World Youth Day 2002 had the support of some 25,000 volunteers; and some 100,000 pilgrims themselves spent three hours each on one of 750 service projects. The groundswell of Catholic spirituality following World Youth Day 2002 in Canada led to the establishment of Canada's first national Catholic television network, Salt + Light Television. Fr. Thomas Rosica, who was the National Director of WYD2002, is also the founder and Chief Executive Officer of this new television station. For the third time (after Buenos Aires 1987 and Denver 1993) the World Youth Day was celebrated in the Americas. The Chief Executive Officer and National Director of these WYD was Father Thomas Rosica. The choice of Toronto by John Paul II The Pope announced the decision to organize the WYD in Toronto during the Angelus of August 20, 2000 held on the large esplanade of Tor Vergata at the end of the World Youth Day 2000. These are his words: \\"Before I dissolve this great and beautiful assembly, I wish to announce that the next World Youth Meeting will take place in Toronto, Canada, in the summer of the Duemiladue. As I now invite the young people of the world to walk towards that goal, I address a special greeting to the Canadian Delegation, who wanted to be present at this celebration to collect the delivery of the future commitment. On them and on the assignment I assume today I invoke the protection of the Blessed Virgin.\\" Theme The theme of the event was a fragment from Jesus' speech on the Mount of Beatitudes: \\"You are the salt of the earth ... you are the light of the world\\". (Matthew 5:13-14). Events The World Youth Day began with a pre-program in numerous Canadian dioceses. =18 to 21 July= From 18 to 21 July, for the first time the international guests were also invited to stay in 35 dioceses throughout Canada (mostly in Montreal and Quebec). In this way they experienced local culture; they also carried out social activities in the cities where they resided; they prayed with the young Canadians, and they organized parties and concerts. =22 July= The young pilgrims arrived to the Canadian diocese to Toronto on 22 July. They took up accommodation in the lodgings. They had the first meetings with the young people of the city. =23 July= The official start in Toronto was the opening show on Tuesday, July 23 at 16:00 local time. Archbishop of Toronto, Cardinal Aloysius Ambrozic celebrated the opening mass at 5 pm in the Exhibition Place, a vast exhibition area near Lake Ontario. On this occasion, the Archbishop welcomed the young people of the other Canadian dioceses and of the various nations to the city. After the mass there was a concert where Canadian artists performed themselves. =24 July= In the morning the catechesis began in more than 100 churches and halls of the city, led by bishops from all over the world. The theme of this day were: \\"You are the salt of the earth\\" (Mt 5,13) It started at 2 pm at Coronation Park, a pleasant wooded area on the banks of Ontario (renamed for the occasion Duc in Altum Park), a large space where it was possible to pray before the WYD Cross and confess thanks to a Service of Reconciliation made possible by a large presence of priests of different languages. An area of the park was also dedicated to Eucharistic adoration. In the afternoon the Youth Festival opened, where they found space for a varied panorama of artistic, cultural and spiritual experiences based on the life and faith of young people from all over the world; exhibitions, vigils, concerts, round tables, films, dances and theatrical events were organized at Exhibition Place. At the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto, there was a meeting between Italians and Italian young people, many in Canada. Among the artists present were Antonella Ruggiero, Paolo Vallesi, Ceppe Cantarelli, Massimo Varini Trio, Lisa, Hope Music Group and Anna Tatangelo. For the first time some social assistance projects were included in the Youth Festival, to allow young pilgrims to spend a few hours of their time at the service of the most needy and forge new bonds of solidarity with the community that hosted them. =25 July= The Pope arrived in Toronto on Thursday, July 25, and was welcomed with a welcome event at the Exhibition Park. Catecheses continued by following the theme: \\"You are the light of the world\\" (Mt 5:14). In the evening the Youth Festival continued. In the meantime the Duc reconciliation service continued in Altum Park. =26 July= During the day the catecheses ended by following the theme: \\"Let yourselves be reconciled with God\\" (2Co 5,20). In the evening, the stations of the cross was held at University Avenue, one of Downtown Toronto's main arteries. The Way of the Cross, started by Nathan Philip Square (seat of the municipal building) came in procession to the Royal Ontario Museum passing also in front of the University, the main hospitals and the seat of the provincial parliament. Duc's reconciliation service continued in Altum Park. The Youth Festival ended in the evening. * Friday: \\"Reconcile with God\\" (2 Cor 5,20) =27 July= During the morning Mass for pilgrims took place in the churches of Toronto. Throughout the day the pilgrimage on foot (with a distance of 6 to 10 km) was held towards Downsview Park, the place of the vigil, a former military airport with its 260 hectares, the largest urban park in Canada. At 7.30 pm the vigil with the Pope began. The young people spent the night outdoors on site in adoration to the Blessed Sacrament. =28 July= To the closing event consisted of the vigils, subsequent overnight stay and the closing fair, the approximately 260-acre Downsview Park was used. On the former military airfield, Pope John Paul II early in the morning celebrated the final Holy Mass Holy Mass. The number of participants reaches 800,000 persons. As part of the final event, the Pope announced that the next International World Youth Day 2005 will take place in Cologne. In an appeal, he then turned to the German-speaking youth: \\"Dear young German! It is especially important to you to keep alive the spirit of World Youth Day in view of the meeting in Cologne in 2005. Join in a civilization of love and justice! Be yourself a shining example that leads many others to the kingdom of Christ, the kingdom of truth, justice and peace. \\" Pope John Paul II Days in the Diocese It was also Pope John Paul II's last World Youth day. World Youth Day 2002 solidified Days of the Diocese, held in various dioceses - with the majority in Montreal, Quebec and London, Ontario - as a major component leading up to the actual WYD Celebrations. The scale is massive: Days of the Diocese involved the participation of 35 of Canada's 72 dioceses. Events in various communities welcomed pilgrims from all over the world with music, prayers, and cathechetical sessions. The week-long World Youth Day Celebrations involved the use of some 129 Catholic churches and 7 halls at Exhibition Place, 10 stages (as well as Downsview Park and 5 other parks in Toronto), 30 seminars, 10 prayer experiences, 300 vocational or service group exhibits, 10 cultural gatherings. John Paul II's Last WYD With deteriorating health, there was speculation that the Pope would not be able to attend the celebrations. At his arrival address, he thanked the local, provincial, and federal levels of the Canadian government for supporting the idea of hosting WYD. He recalled his previous Apostolic Journeys to the country and acknowledged that he does not have the same physical strength he once had. Pope John Paul II participated by being present at all the major events of the week. While not being able to participate in person, he did view the Friday Stations of the Cross via television coverage by the CBC. He led the Saturday evening vigil and presided over the Holy Mass on the Sunday, delivering a homily which focused on entrusting the future of the Church to the youth.http://www.ewtn.com/wyd2002/news_articles/wyd_numbers.htm ewtn.com Theme song The theme song, \\"Light of the World\\" was composed by Fr Robert Lebel, a Quebec priest and a well-known composer of French-language religious music; and translated into English by Bishop Paul-André Durocher. Four official versions were released as follows: *\\"Lumière du monde\\" (International) - with an English/French chorus, and four verses in French, English, Spanish and Italian, respectively. *\\"Light of the World\\" (English) *\\"Lumière du monde\\" (French) *\\"Lumière du monde\\" (Instrumental) The songs were released on a two disc official CD set entitled \\"Lumière du Monde/Light of the World\\", released by Oregon Catholic Press (OCP). The album featured bands such as Critical Mass, Susan HooKong Taylor, Janelle, and Jesse Manibusan, among others. Other versions were also released in localised languages which include the following Chinese versions released by Photon Distribution, Inc. on the disc entitled The Way 4 - Light of the World: *\\"Light of the World\\" (粤話版) - with Cantonese verses and an English/Cantonese chorus translated by the \\"World Youth Day 2002 Theme Song Cantonese Translation Team\\" and sung by Tony Leung and Agnes Tao. *\\"Light of the World\\" (國話版) - with Mandarin translations by Kevin Cheung; sung by Ricky Cheung and Martina Lee. *\\"Light of the World\\" (Chinese Instrumental) - arranged by James Ng with Chinese instruments Attendance and afterwards A crowd of over 800,000 to 850,000 youths from all over the world was in attendance for these events, a presence below expectations, mainly due to the international conflict that had shaken America and especially the United States after the attack of September 11, 2001. One of the results of the WYD on Canadian soil was the creation of Salt + Light Television, a bilingual Catholic television network broadcast throughout the country that produces several original programs in both English and French. Father Thomas Rosica, who was the national director of the World Youth Day 2002, is also the founder and executive officer of this television channel.

Plot The episode begins with a flashback set seven years ago, where it is revealed that Brian was born in a puppy mill and taken from his mother. Back in the present, Brian tells his psychiatrist about the memory. Afterwards, Brian volunteers to pick up Stewie from his vacation at his grandparents' summer home in Palm Springs, California, where Stewie frames a maid for stealing to amuse himself at dinner. At the airport bar, Brian gets drunk and, when Stewie comes to find him, their plane tickets are stolen. They stop at a decrepit motel, where Stewie tries calling home, but fails because he believes his phone number is 867-5309. The next day, they have to escape and hotwire a car due to their credit card being rejected. To get home, Stewie and Brian masquerade as crop dusters to steal a plane, which they immediately crash. As the pair continue hitchhiking back to Quahog, they pass by a puppy mill near Austin, Texas, Brian's birthplace. Upon arrival, they discover that Brian's mother died one year prior to their arrival, was taxidermied and turned into a table by the puppy mill owners as a memorial. With Stewie's half-hearted help, Brian gives his mother a proper burial. The pair eventually complete their journey home by riding in an open boxcar, where Brian attempts to apologize to Stewie for all of the trouble he has put both of them through, only to have Stewie reply that he actually enjoyed it. In high spirits, they perform a musical duet \\"Off On the Road to Rhode Island\\" as the train takes them home. When Stewie and Brian return home, Lois asks Stewie about the trip, and Stewie covers up for Brian by saying the trip was \\"Smooth sailing through calm seas\\". Lois leaves and Brian tells Stewie that he is thankful to Stewie for covering for him, and asks Stewie if there's anything he can do to repay him. At first, it appears that Stewie wishes to make him his servant by providing an example with an episode of The Brady Bunch, although it turns out that Stewie wants Brian to tape that episode for him.Callaghan, pp. 90–95 Meanwhile, Lois urges Peter to watch relationship videos with her, but the videos turn out to be pornography hosted by Dr. Amanda Rebecca, who strips after asking the women to leave the room. Peter becomes addicted to the videos, much to Lois's chagrin. She gets herself on the end of one of the tapes in black lingerie and entices Peter. While kissing, Peter rewinds the tape, playing the part of Lois taking her robe off over and over. Production \\"Road to Rhode Island\\" was the first episode to be directed by Dan Povenmire. \\"Road to Rhode Island\\" was directed by Dan Povenmire and was written by Gary Janetti. It featured guest appearances from Victoria Principal as Dr. Amanda Rebecca, Danny Smith and Wally Wingert as various characters. This was the first episode directed by Povenmire.Callaghan, p. 90 Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane granted Povenmire substantial creative freedom for directing episodes. Povenmire said that MacFarlane would tell him, \\"We've got two minutes to fill. Give me some visual gags. Do whatever you want. I trust you.\\" Povenmire praised MacFarlane's management style for letting him have fun. Several years after the episode was written, in DVD commentary for the eighth and ninth season of the show, Gary Janetti, the writer of the episode, recalled that the original title of the episode was intended to be simply \\"Brian & Stewie\\", but was changed by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, who wanted there to be a \\"Road to\\" episode each season. The name of the episode was then changed to \\"Road to Rhode Island\\", with the original name later being used for the landmark 150th episode of the show, also entitled \\"Brian & Stewie\\", and written by Janetti. This is the first episode of the \\"Road to\\" episodes of the series which air through various seasons of the show. The episodes are a parody of the seven \\"Road to\\" comedy films starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour. MacFarlane, a fan of the film series, came up with the idea. The musical number in the episode is sung to the tune of \\"(We're Off on the) Road to Morocco\\" from the film Road to Morocco. =Edits= During the airport section of the episode, there is a scene that has subsequently cut from some editions/airings of the show, involving Osama bin Laden. In the scene, Stewie, when approaching airport security, realizes that his bag is full of weapons. He then breaks into song, singing \\"On the Good Ship Lollipop\\" to distract the X-ray scanners. He then says, \\"Let's hope Osama bin Laden doesn't know show tunes.\\" At that time, Osama is pictured in another line, distracting the scanners by singing \\"I hope I get it\\" from A Chorus Line. Even though the episode was made a year and a half before 9/11, it was still controversial, and was cut on the Family Guy: Volume 1 DVD in the US. However, the scene was left intact on the \\"Freakin' Sweet Collection\\". Reception In his 2009 review, Ahsan Haque of IGN, rating the episode 10/10, praised the episode, saying: \\"Great writing, hilarious jokes, a catchy musical, and a story that's both hilarious and touching at the same time – Family Guy doesn't get much better than this.\\" It is one of the only three Family Guy episodes that has ever been given a \\"Masterpiece\\" (10/10) rating by IGN, the other being \\"I Never Met the Dead Man\\" and \\"Da Boom\\". IGN also placed the episode at the top of their list of \\"Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures\\", and again in the list of \\"Top 20 Family Guy episodes\\" to celebrate the show's 20th anniversary. The episode was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour), but lost to The Simpsons episode \\"Behind the Laughter\\". Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number thirteen on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of \\"yukyukyuks\\" and despite describing the episode as \\"hilarious\\", he said that Brian discovering his mother's body was \\"ultra emotional\\" and \\"one of the rare emotionally-charged moments in the show.\\" He added that he \\"can never get enough\\" of Brian and Stewie and their bromance.

It is on the Cross-City Line which runs from Redditch to Lichfield via Birmingham New Street. History The station opened on 3 April 1876 as the temporary southern terminus of the Birmingham West Suburban Railway, while the difficult construction of the junction with the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway was completed at Kings Norton. Stirchley Street opened as a single platform with later added run around loop. In an initial land rental agreement with the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, the station sits above Bournville Lane, as the tracks are on an embankment, shared with the canal. Bournville station in 1962. Pre-electrification. With the opening of the Cadbury Bournville Factory in 1879, in 1880 the station was renamed Stirchley Street and Bournville. After an improved through connection was developed to the Birmingham and Gloucester at Kings Norton in 1885, the railway track to Birmingham was doubled along its lines entire length as the line was extended into Birmingham New Street. This necessitated the construction of a southbound platform between the line and the canal, resulting even today in a narrow platform. In 1904, the station was finally renamed Bournville. The station has never had any goods facilities, but north of its location were the exchange sidings with the of the Bournville Works Railway, while south of it there was a Midland Railway developed roundhouse engine shed, which opened in 1895 and closed in 1961. The station area has changed considerably since the Midland Railway days and lost virtually all its original features as the station was completely rebuilt by British Rail in 1978 to the designs of the architect John Broome along with the others on this line when the Cross-City route was commissioned. Prior to the rebuild, the station had only received a limited service (mainly at peak hours) for much of the 1960s and 1970s. The line was electrified in 1993. Station masters *H.G.

He spent the majority of his career at Bristol City. He won six England caps between 1955 and 1957, scoring five goals. Atyeo made 645 appearances for Bristol City and scored a record 351 goals for them. He played as an amateur for Portsmouth in 1950/51, then as a part-time professional for Bristol City while qualifying as a quantity surveyor until signing full-time ahead of the 1958/59 season. In 1963/64 he reverted to part-time status to prepare the way for his post-football career as a mathematics teacher.Football League registration card Biography Peter John Walter Atyeo was born at Clivey on the outskirts of Dilton Marsh, Wiltshire.Birth Certificate He went to Berkley Primary School, near Frome, Somerset after his parents had moved the short distance over the county line to Standerwick when he was about 6 months old. As a schoolboy he played competitive football, rugby and cricket. His first competitive games were for Westbury United F. C., then Football League champions Portsmouth gave him two first team appearances in the 1950/51 season as an amateur, but he signed as a professional for Bristol City in the following season. He enjoyed a fifteen-year career with Bristol City despite offers from Chelsea, Spurs, Liverpool and AC Milan which were worth around £20 million in today's money and could have made him the most expensive player in England, making 645 appearances and became Bristol City's all-time top scorer with 351 goals by the time he retired in May 1966. He captained the team during their promotion winning season in 1965. He played semi-professionally for Bristol City (1951/52 to 57/58 seasons) while qualifying as a quantity surveyor until signing full-time ahead of the 1958/59 season. In 1963 he reverted to part-time status to prepare the way for his post-football career as a mathematics teacher. Atyeo won six England caps from 1955 to 1957. Although Bill Slater was also a part-timer, there was conjecture that Atyeo's part-time status led to his being dropped by the England selectors despite never having been on a losing side in his six international appearances, scoring five goals and having scored the goal that enabled England to qualify for the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden. Following his retirement from football, Atyeo became a full-time mathematics teacher at Kingdown School, Warminster, where he served for over 20 years, rising to head of mathematics, House Master of Arn House and Deputy Headmaster. He was regarded as a dedicated teacher. Atyeo also wrote a regular football column for the Plymouth-based Sunday Independent newspaper. He died at home in Warminster of heart failure on 8 June 1993, survived by his wife Ruth and five children: Julie, Carol, Alison, Linda and Philip. Playing careerPortsmouth 1950–51= As a teenage amateur, Atyeo played twice in the top flight for the then League Champions Portsmouth. Both were home matches at Fratton Park and finished as draws: vs Charlton Athletic 3-3, 11/11/50 and vs Arsenal 1-1, 26/03/51.Portsmouth Evening News =Signing for Bristol City= It was due to the endeavours of the then Bristol City chairman, Harry Dolman, that Atyeo was signed by Bristol City rather than Portsmouth or other interested clubs. Dolman had a friend of his William Grant C.B.E. take the contract for the services of Atyeo down to Dilton Marsh, Wiltshire on 14 June 1951. He walked along the main railway line to the signal box where Atyeo's father worked and returned with a signed contract. The contract was unusual in having six specific clauses at the insistence of Atyeo's father. Atyeo should always be on top wages at Bristol City; he should always be allowed to live at home and continue his apprenticeship as a quantity surveyor; he should be allowed to drive to training on Tuesdays & Thursdays; City would donate £100 to Westbury United; City would play a friendly at Westbury United at the end of season 1952–1953 and Atyeo would not be put on the transfer list without the consent of his father. =Season 1951–52= Atyeo joined Bristol City, a mid table side in the Third Division South, in the summer of 1951. Atyeo made his Football League debut at centre forward in the opening game of the 1951–52 season in a 3–1 win v Newport County on 18 August 1951. Cyril Williams made his debut for City on his return from West Bromwich Albion in the same match. Both Atyeo and Williams were scorers in the win. The other goalscorer was Arnold Rodgers who had been the top scorer for Bristol City in the previous season with 20 goals in the no.9 shirt. Rodgers played inside left in 1951–52 as newcomer Atyeo took the centre forward role. Atyeo made 44 appearances scoring 12 goals in 1951–52 finishing joint top scorer with Arnold Rodgers who netted his 12 goals from 36 appearances. In the FA Cup Atyeo scored both goals on his FA Cup debut in the 1st round 2–1 win at Brighton & Hove Albion. This was the first time that Atyeo (2) appeared in the list of goalscorers, the second time was when Bristol City took a team to Westbury United on 24 April 1952 and won 2–0. On that occasion Atyeo was helped by scoring one goal from a penalty. =Season 1952–53= Bristol City started the season poorly, Atyeo failed to score in the opening three matches at centre forward and moved to inside right for the remainder of his league appearances. Arnold Rodgers reverted to centre forward and scored four goals in the next four games and then followed this up with three successive doubles late in September. After the first 13 matches Bristol City lay in 10th place in the Third Division South and Atyeo had netted three goals. Atyeo then dropped out of the team until returning in the New Year on 3 January 1953 at Brighton & Hove Albion with the team on a 7 match unbeaten run and by this time in 3rd position in the table. The improvement was in part due to the signing by Pat Beasley of centre half Jack White for £5,300 from Aldershot. White was a dominant personality who was immediately installed as captain of the side. Atyeo netted his first league double in a 5–1 win v Walsall on 7 March 1953 and played in front of a crowd of 35,606 in February in the 0–0 draw with Bristol Rovers at Ashton Gate. Bristol City finished the season in 5th place but the disappointment was that they were five points behind local rivals Bristol Rovers who won promotion to the Second Division as Champions. Atyeo made 33 appearances and score 11 goals which proved to be the lowest for any season of his prolific goalscoring career. Rodgers was leading scorer with 26 goals, Cyril Williams netted 17 times and Alec Eisentrager scored 12 goals from the right wing. Atyeo enjoyed a post season friendly tour of Cornwall scoring twice at Penzance and four goals at Newquay in May 1953. =Season 1953–54= Again Bristol City started the season badly and were 20th with four games played. Atyeo began the season at inside right with Arnold Rodgers at centre forward and Cyril Williams at inside left. Jack Boxley became the regular left winger while Alec Eisentrager, Jimmy Rogers and Ernie Jones tussled for the position of outside right. Andy Micklewright newly signed in May 1953 from Bristol Rovers quickly made his presence felt playing in several positions across the forward line and ending the season as 2nd top scorer with 16 goals. Atyeo missed only one league game, a 0–5 defeat at Swindon Town in October, as Bristol City made a steady rise up the table before Christmas to start the New Year in 8th place and finish in 3rd position a full eight points behind champions Ipswich Town. Atyeo made 45 appearances and was the leading scorer with 22 goals, his highest seasons tally to date, as Bristol City netted 88 goals during the season. Atyeo was most prolific in mid season scoring 17 goals in a 20 match spell between the end of September and 20 February 1954 when he netted his first hat-trick for the club in a 5–1 win v Swindon Town. Atyeo also scored a goal in each of the three rounds of the FA Cup as Bristol City eventually lost 1–3 v Rotherham United in front of 29,216 fans in the 3rd round. Atyeo also scored in a series of first team friendlies arranged throughout the season which saw the likes of Fenerbache, Chelsea, Hajduk Split and Arsenal visiting Ashton Gate. Although Atyeo was the leading scorer in 1953–54 it was Arnold Rodgers who had the best ratio for scoring with 14 goals in 23 appearances. =Champions of Third Division South= Bristol City hit the ground running in season 1954–55 reaching top spot in mid September and staying in one of the top two positions throughout the rest of the season. Jimmy Rogers took over as the regular right winger to partner Atyeo who played all season in the no.8 shirt. Arnold Rodgers played at centre forward in the first half of the season with Jimmy Rogers switching to centre forward for the second half. In the absence of Rogers, Eisentrager returned briefly before England international outside right Arthur Milton was signed by Pat Beasley for £4,000 from First Division Arsenal for a cameo 14 appearances in the promotion run in. Milton became the last double England international at both football and cricket in 1958 when he made his Test cricket debut. Milton gave up football in the summer of 1955 to concentrate on cricket with Gloucestershire as a consequence of which Arsenal refunded half of the transfer fee paid by Bristol City. Atyeo scored regularly throughout the season including doubles at Coventry City and Walsall along with doubles at Ashton Gate against Aldershot, Millwall, Bournemouth & Crystal Palace. Bristol City finished as champions of Third Division South nine points clear of runners up Leyton Orient. The 70 points (when it was 2 for a win and 1 for a draw) obtained by Bristol City equalled the record for the Third Division South set by Nottingham Forest four years earlier. Jack White and Atyeo were the only ever presents in the championship winning side of 1954–55. Atyeo made 46 appearances and was top scorer with 28 goals as City scored 101 league goals. Jimmy Rogers was next highest scorer with 25 goals and Arnold Rodgers again maintained a good goal ratio with 13 goals in 26 appearances. City continued to arrange first team friendlies entertaining Rheims and Linz at Ashton Gate and ending the season in May with a European tour including Hamborn 07, Linz and Stuttgart Kickers. =30 goals in 1955–56= In 1955–56 Bristol City returned to the Second Division for the first time since relegation when finishing bottom in season 1931–32. There were no new names in the Bristol City team that took the field in the opening game a 2–1 win v Swansea Town on 20 August 1955 which was the Second Division debut for Atyeo. Two days later Atyeo scored the first of many goals in the Second Division in a 3–1 win at Rotherham United. Atyeo played at inside right throughout the season with Eisentrager as his regular right wing partner until Pat Beasley signed Wally Hinshelwood for £15,000 from Reading in February 1956. Jimmy Rogers had his most productive goalscoring season with 25 goals from centre forward. Tommy Burden provided the skill and drive at inside left and Jack Boxley was on the left wing completing the regular forward line. Atyeo missed only 3 league games, all of which were defeats, two against Leeds United. Atyeo had a productive first half of the season scoring 20 goals in his first 19 games as the \\"Robins\\" stormed to the top of the table in mid November and remained at the summit until Christmas Eve. Atyeo scored a hat-trick (including a penalty) in a 3–1 win v Bury on 17 September and another hat- trick in a 5–1 win v Lincoln City on 3 December. City only won seven more league games after the win over Lincoln City and finished in 11th position in the final Second Division table as Atyeo scored only 10 more goals in the remaining 20 matches, still a good goals per game ratio. Overall Atyeo made 39 appearances and scored 30 goals in the league recording the highest total of league goals in a season in his career. This is the closest Atyeo came to the Bristol City record for goals in a season held by Don Clark with 36 goals in 1946–47. In the FA Cup a crowd of 46,493 saw City defeated 1–3 in the 3rd round at Everton. However the 46,713 who witnessed the 1–2 league defeat at Liverpool became the largest crowd to watch Atyeo in Bristol City colours, that is, until the following season. Frankfurt, Nice and Stuttgart Kickers were the European teams welcomed to Ashton Gate for first team friendlies with Atyeo a regular scorer in the friendlies. =England 1955–1957= Atyeo made his England debut at inside right in a 4–1 friendly win over Spain at Wembley on 30 November 1955 in a forward line of Tom Finney (PNE); Atyeo; Nat Lofthouse (Bolton W); Johnny Haynes (Fulham) and Perry (Blackpool). Atyeo, Perry (2) & Finney scored. Atyeo won his 2nd England cap at inside right in a 4–2 friendly win over Brazil at Wembley on 9 May 1956 in a forward line of Stanley Matthews (Blackpool); Atyeo; Tommy Taylor (Man Utd); Haynes (Fulham) and Grainger (Sheff Utd). Taylor (2) & Grainger (2) scored. Atyeo took and missed a penalty in this match. Atyeo won his 3rd England cap at inside right in a 0–0 friendly draw with Sweden in Stockholm on 16 May 1956 in a forward line of Berry (Man Utd); Atyeo; Taylor (Man Utd); Haynes (Fulham) and Finney (Preston). Atyeo won his 4th England cap at inside right in a 5–1 World Cup win over Republic of Ireland at Wembley on 8 May 1957 in a forward line of Matthews (Blackpool); Atyeo; Taylor (Man Utd); Haynes (Fulham) and Finney (Preston). Taylor (3) & Atyeo (2) scored. Atyeo won his 5th England cap at inside right in a 4–1 World Cup win over Denmark in Copenhagen on 15 May 1957 in a forward line of Matthews (Blackpool); Atyeo; Taylor (Man Utd); Haynes (Fulham) and Finney (Preston). Haynes, Taylor (2) & Atyeo scored. Atyeo won his 6th and final England cap at inside right in a 1–1 World Cup draw with Republic of Ireland in Dublin on 19 May 1957 in a forward line of Finney (Preston); Atyeo; Taylor (Man Utd); Haynes (Fulham) and David Pegg (Man Utd). Atyeo scored the goal. Overall Atyeo won 6 England caps scoring 5 goals and played alongside experienced England internationals like Tom Finney 76 caps (1946–1958), Stanley Matthews 54 caps (1934–1957), Johnny Haynes 56 caps (1954–1962), Nat Lofthouse 33 caps (1950–1958) and Tommy Taylor 19 caps (1953–1957). Bill Perry 3 caps, Colin Grainger 7 caps, Johnny Berry 4 caps and David Pegg a single cap made fewer appearances but it must be remembered that there were far fewer internationals played in the 1950s than nowadays. =Season 1956–57= Bristol City struggled throughout 1956–57 hovering above the relegation places for much of the season before settling into mid table with a run of 8 league victories in 9 matches between mid February and mid April 1957. Atyeo started the season with five goals in the opening 4 matches playing mainly at inside right alongside Hinshelwood on the right wing. However, in mid November manager Pat Beasley sold both centre forward Jimmy Rogers and left winger Jack Boxley to Coventry City. This prompted the signing of Irish centre forward Dermot Curtis from Shelborne for £5,000 in December 1956. Atyeo moved between inside right and centre forward depending on whether Curtis was playing in the team. Further forward line changes took place at much the same time as Bobby Etheridge signed from Gloucester City and young Johnny Watkins teamed up to form a new left sided partnership for Bristol City. As a result, only Hinshelwood with 41 appearances and Atyeo with 37 appearances were regulars throughout the season. Atyeo was the leading scorer again with 23 goals and Curtis the only other to reach double figures with 13 goals in only 16 games. Atyeo scored a league hat-trick in a 5–1 win v Sheffield United in January. Atyeo also created Bristol City history on 16 March 1957 scoring after only nine seconds of the match v Bury which City went on to win 2–0 with Atyeo scoring both goals. This still remains as the fastest ever goal scored in a match by a Bristol City player. In the FA Cup Atyeo scored doubles in both the 3rd & 4th round ties v Rotherham United and Rhyl. Atyeo also scored the goal in a 1–2 defeat at Aston Villa in the 5th round before a crowd of 63,099. =Season 1957–58= Bristol City spent another season in 1957–58 struggling to avoid dropping into the relegation places. A poor run in mid season of only a single win in 14 matches between mid November and the start of March 1958 prompted a change of manager with Pat Beasley sacked on 6 January. There followed a three-week spell of caretaker management until Harry Dolman secured Peter Doherty as the new manager from Doncaster Rovers whom Dolman had first sought some nine years earlier. Doherty was quick to sign inside right Bert Tindill from Doncaster Rovers for £6,400 on 3 February and seven wins in the last 12 games lifted the \\"Robins\\" to safety and a 17th-place finish in the Second Division. The forward line had a distinctly more stable look in 1957–58 with wingers Hinshelwood and Watkins, Atyeo at centre forward and Etheridge at inside left. Tommy Burden, Curtis, Eisentrager and latterly Tindill also all featured in short spells across the forward line. Atyeo was the only ever present player with 42 appearances and ended as leading scorer with 23 goals including a hat-trick in a 3–0 win at Sheffield United. Tindill scored ten goals in only 14 appearances including successive hat-tricks in April wins v Barnsley and at Fulham. In the FA Cup the 5th round tie v Bristol Rovers at Ashton Gate drew a crowd of 39,160 but resulted in a 3–4 defeat to the local rivals. Atyeo scored twice in a mid season friendly 4–3 win over Tottenham Hotspur. =Season 1958–59= Following a season of management change there was incredible stability within the team in 1958–59. Nine of the team appeared in 37 or more league matches with a line up of Cook; Hopkinson, Thresher; McCall, Williams, Burden; Hinshelwood, Tindill, Atyeo, Etheridge and Watkins. Bristol City opened with 6–1 and 7–4 wins but then lost 0–4 at Sheffield United. Atyeo scored a hat-trick in the 7–4 win at Barnsley on 27 August 1958 and added a second hat-trick in the 4–0 win v Swansea Town on 11 October 1958. This had City fans dreaming of a return to the First Division as the \\"Robins\\" remained in contention for promotion through to January when 6th in the table before falling away to a final 10th-place finish. Atyeo was top goalscorer again with 26 goals in 40 appearances leading the line as centre forward. Tindill scored 19 goals and Etheridge 13 goals as the inside forwards. In the FA Cup City lost 0–1 in a 4th round replay at Blackpool. The 1–1 home draw had attracted 42,594 fans to see an ageing Stanley Matthews confronted by the City left back Mike Thresher. =Relegation in 1959–60= Bristol City started 1959–60 poorly despite the club record fee signing of left wing pairing Malcolm Graham and Johnny McCann from Barnsley for a combined £20,000 with Bert Tindill leaving in the opposite direction. Other additions of left half Tommy Casey from Newcastle United and inside forward Tommy Cavanagh from Doncaster Rovers together with the return of Jimmy Rogers from Coventry City all gave City fans hope of a good season but by mid September the side were bottom of the table and between 21 November 1959 and the end of the season the \\"Robins\\" never rose above the two relegation places eventually being relegated as 22nd and bottom of the table. The season was beset by injury with McCann breaking his leg in Boxing Day match and Graham scoring 8 goals from only 14 appearances through persistent knee injuries. Atyeo finished a disappointing season as one of only two ever presents in the team, the other being the goalkeeper Tony Cook. Atyeo was also joint top scorer for Bristol City with 16 goals from his 42 appearances. Rogers also scored 16 goals from only 31 appearances on his return to Ashton Gate. Manager Peter Doherty was dismissed on 15 March and relegation confirmed by defeat at Leyton Orient on 23 April. The new manager Fred Ford was not appointed until July 1960. =Season 1960–61= The Football League parallel Third Divisions South & North had been reformed into a Third and Fourth Division so City played their first ever season of Third Division football under new manager Fred Ford. Bristol City spent most of the season 1960–61 in mid table. Atyeo missed a few early games but by October the forward line took on a fairly consistent look. Jimmy Rogers on the right wing partnered Atyeo at inside right. While Bristol youngsters Bobby Williams & Jantzen Derrick formed the left flank. New signing Alex Tait costing £5,000 from Newcastle United was the centre forward. Atyeo made 37 appearances scoring 19 goals including a hat- trick in the final game of the season in a 3–0 win v Brentford. This made Atyeo leading goalscorer once again with Tait scoring 15 goals. In the FA Cup Chichester City forfeited home advantage in the 1st round on 5 November 1960 and Bristol City scored a record highest ever FA Cup win by 11–0 with Atyeo scoring five goals. In the inaugural season of the League Cup Atyeo played in all three ties scoring twice in the 2nd round replay v Aldershot and in the 1–2 3rd round defeat at Nottingham Forest. =Season 1961–62= Bristol City rose steadily up the table from a slow start and hovered in 2nd or 3rd place in the table throughout February & March 1962 before finishing in 6th position. Two local Bristol boys Brian Clark and Roger \\"Lou\\" Peters who had both made their debuts in the final game v Brentford in 1961–62 were given increased chances at inside right and outside left respectively. Overall the forward line was consistent with the previous season. Jimmy Rogers scored only four goals in his final season with the \\"Robins\\" on the right wing. Alex Tait scored 13 goals from centre forward while \\"Shadow\\" Wiliams netted 21 goals from inside left. Jantzen Derrick also scored four goals from the left wing. Atyeo was again top scorer with 26 goals from 42 appearances including hat- tricks in a 3–0 win v Grimsby Town in October and in a 4–0 win at Swindon Town in March. Atyeo also scored four goals in a 6–0 win v Notts County on 16 December 1961. =Season 1962–63 Snow on Boxing Day= Heavy snow fell on Boxing Day 1962 and stayed on the ground until a major thaw at the beginning of March 1963. During January Bristol City played only a single FA Cup 3rd round tie with the replay taking place on 7 March 1963 when City lost 2–3 at Aston Villa. Bristol City played only home games between the away defeats in league matches at Millwall on 15 December and at Swindon Town on 2 March. The backlog in fixtures led to Bristol City playing 8 matches in April and 4 in May a total of 12 games in 43 days at the end of the season. Atyeo only played in three of these backlog fixtures with Tait switching from right wing to centre forward. Bristol City scored 100 league goals but conceded 92 during the season. The \\"Robins\\" kept only three clean sheets, all in September, and failed to score in only four matches. Atyeo moved to centre forward for most of his 30 appearances scoring 16 goals and finishing behind both \\"Shadow\\" Williams and top scorer Brian Clark in the goal scoring charts. In a season of goals all five of the regular forward line reached double figures for goals. Both wingers Alex Tait and Jantzen Derrick scored ten goals, while inside forwards Clark netted 23 times and Williams scored 19 goals. Even Barrie Meyer the Gloucestershire cricketer scored seven goals in 6 games when deputising for Atyeo. Bristol City spent the whole season in mid table finishing in 14th position but second top scorers in the Third Division. =Season 1963–64= Bristol City started the season in mid table and slowly improved to finish in 5th position just five points short of promotion. The team remained remarkably consistent throughout the season with nine players appearing in 38 or more matches together with Derrick 33 and Low 32. The familiar line up was Gibson; Briggs, Thresher; Parr, Connor, Low; Derrick, Clark, Atyeo, \\"Shadow\\" Williams and Hooper. Peter Hooper the left winger with the explosive shot was the only new recruit in the summer costing £11,000 from Cardiff City. Atyeo was ever present with 46 appearances scoring 21 goals. Atyeo also played in the Boxing Day fixture which was abandoned at half time v QPR with City winning 3–0. Atyeo was the leading City goal scorer for the season ahead of inside forwards Clark, the only other ever present, with 19 goals and Williams 20 goals. Atyeo scored 12 goals in the first 21 games but then failed to score in a spell of 7 matches before hitting a hat-trick in a 5–1 win v Walsall on 8 February 1964. Atyeo also netted four FA Cup goals as Bristol City reached the 4th round before they lost 1–6 at Sunderland. =Season 1964–65 Promoted from Third Division= After an initial 2–5 defeat at Scunthorpe United Bristol City embarked on a remarkable run of six matches winning 5–1, 5–1, 4–0, 5–0, 4–0 with a 2–2 draw at Watford sandwiched in between. This left City at the top of the Third Division table and Brian Clark had scored 11 goals in 7 matches while Atyeo had scored two hat-tricks in only five games in a 5–1 win v Walsall on 29 August 1964 and a 4–0 win v Southend United on 8 September. After this Bristol City remained near the top but never again reached the top two promotion positions until the final two games of the season. The final run in of 12 wins in the last 15 matches clinching promotion on goal average on the final day with a 2–0 win v Oldham Athletic in front of a crowd of 28,248 on 24 April 1965. Atyeo scored six goals in the final three games including 4 goals in a 5–1 win at Shrewsbury Town on 19 April 1965. Brian Clark ended the season as ever present and top scorer with 24 goals. Atyeo scored 23 goals but made fewer appearances playing in only 38 matches. Atyeo began the season at centre forward flanked by inside forwards Clark and \\"Shadow\\" Williams. Williams was replaced for a spell in mid season by young Gerry Sharpe and then Williams was sold for £11,000 to Rotherham United. This led to a switch with Atyeo reverting to inside right, Clark moving to inside left and utility player Terry Bush stepping up from half back to centre forward to good effect scoring eight times in the run in to promotion. Atyeo was captain of this promotion winning team. =Season 1965–66 Retirement= Back in the Second Division Bristol City conceded only 48 goals, the third best defensive record in the division, and lost only eight matches, only champions Manchester City lost fewer. Bristol City remained in the promotion race throughout the season but only broke into the top two promotion positions briefly for one weekend in September. Over the Easter period a 0–1 defeat v Southampton at Ashton Gate effectively ended the promotion push and the \\"Robins\\" finished three points behind runners up Southampton in 5th place in the final table which was the highest finishing position that the \\"Robins\\" achieved in the playing career of Atyeo. Atyeo made 35 appearances and ended his career as top scorer on 19 goals with Clark scoring 15 goals despite playing in more games. Atyeo scored doubles in away games at Portsmouth where City won 4–2 in November, at Coventry City in 2–2 draw and in the following match a 2–4 defeat at Middlesbrough. In his final game in Bristol City colours on 10 May 1966 v Ipswich Town, Atyeo scored a further two goals in a 4–1 win in front of a rather meagre 13,893 crowd. Atyeo was joint top scorer in his debut season 1951–52 and top scorer in his final season 1965–66. In all Atyeo was top scorer in ten seasons, joint top scorer in another two and beaten only in three seasons by Arnold Rodgers in 1952–53 and by Brian Clark in both 1962–63 and 1964–65. Atyeo never failed to reach double figures for league goals scored in his 15-season career at Ashton Gate. Atyeo was also ever present in four seasons 1954–55, 1957–58, 1959–60 and 1963–64 which included the promotion campaign of 1954–55. During the promotion season of 1964-65 Atyeo was not selected for the away match at Gillingham on 6 February. This was the only time in his Bristol City career that he was fit and able to play but not selected. The Gillingham game was the sixth in a run which realised two draws and four defeats. Not picking Atyeo had the desired effect with Bristol City winning their next seven consecutive games (including victory against arch- rivals Bristol Rovers) and in fact, they won twelve and drew two of their last fifteen games to clinch promotion.

The extended CDR3 loop is coloured orange. A single-domain antibody (sdAb), also known as a nanobody, is an antibody fragment consisting of a single monomeric variable antibody domain. Like a whole antibody, it is able to bind selectively to a specific antigen. With a molecular weight of only 12–15 kDa, single-domain antibodies are much smaller than common antibodies (150–160 kDa) which are composed of two heavy protein chains and two light chains, and even smaller than Fab fragments (~50 kDa, one light chain and half a heavy chain) and single-chain variable fragments (~25 kDa, two variable domains, one from a light and one from a heavy chain). The first single-domain antibodies were engineered from heavy-chain antibodies found in camelids; these are called VHH fragments. Cartilaginous fishes also have heavy-chain antibodies (IgNAR, 'immunoglobulin new antigen receptor'), from which single-domain antibodies called VNAR fragments can be obtained. An alternative approach is to split the dimeric variable domains from common immunoglobulin G (IgG) from humans or mice into monomers. Although most research into single-domain antibodies is currently based on heavy chain variable domains, nanobodies derived from light chains have also been shown to bind specifically to target epitopes. Single- domain camelid antibodies have been shown to be just as specific as a regular antibody and in some cases they are more robust. As well, they are easily isolated using the same phage panning procedure used for traditional antibodies, allowing them to be cultured in vitro in large concentrations. The smaller size and single domain make these antibodies easier to transform into bacterial cells for bulk production, making them ideal for research purposes. Single-domain antibodies are being researched for multiple pharmaceutical applications and have potential for use in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Properties A single-domain antibody is a peptide chain of about 110 amino acids long, comprising one variable domain (VH) of a heavy-chain antibody, or of a common IgG. These peptides have similar affinity to antigens as whole antibodies, but are more heat-resistant and stable towards detergents and high concentrations of urea. Those derived from camelid and fish antibodies are less lipophilic and more soluble in water, owing to their complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), which forms an extended loop (coloured orange in the ribbon diagram above) covering the lipophilic site that normally binds to a light chain. In contrast to common antibodies, two out of six single-domain antibodies survived a temperature of 90 °C (194 °F) without losing their ability to bind antigens in a 1999 study. Stability towards gastric acid and proteases depends on the amino acid sequence. Some species have been shown to be active in the intestine after oral application, but their low absorption from the gut impedes the development of systemically active orally administered single- domain antibodies. The complex of a single domain antibody and a protein antigen reveals a buried binding site. (left) The nurse shark VNAR single domain in complex with lysozyme (PDB 1T6V). (right) The humanized HyHEL-10 Fv in complex with lysozyme (PDB 2EIZ) The comparatively low molecular mass leads to a better permeability in tissues, and to a short plasma half-life since they are eliminated renally. Unlike whole antibodies, they do not show complement system triggered cytotoxicity because they lack an Fc region. Camelid and fish derived sdAbs are able to bind to hidden antigens that are not accessible to whole antibodies, for example to the active sites of enzymes. This property has been shown to result from their extended CDR3 loop, which is able to penetrate such buried sites. Production A shark (left) and a camelid (middle) heavy-chain antibody in comparison to a common antibody (right). Heavy chains are shown in a darker shade, light chains in a lighter shade. VH and VL are the variable domains. =From heavy-chain antibodies= A single-domain antibody can be obtained by immunization of dromedaries, camels, llamas, alpacas or sharks with the desired antigen and subsequent isolation of the mRNA coding for heavy-chain antibodies. By using a library construction method based on PCR-extension assembly and self-ligation (EASeL), Mitchell Ho and Martin Flajnik established a large phage displayed VNAR antibody library with a size of 1.2 × 1010 from naïve nurse sharks. Screening techniques like phage display and ribosome display help to identify the clones binding the antigen. =From conventional antibodies= Alternatively, single-domain antibodies can be made from common murine, rabbit or human IgG with four chains. The process is similar, comprising gene libraries from immunized or naïve donors and display techniques for identification of the most specific antigens. A problem with this approach is that the binding region of common IgG consists of two domains (VH and VL), which tend to dimerize or aggregate because of their lipophilicity. Monomerization is usually accomplished by replacing lipophilic by hydrophilic amino acids, but often results in a loss of affinity to the antigen. If affinity can be retained, the single-domain antibodies can likewise be produced in E. coli, S. cerevisiae or other organisms. = From human single-domain antibodies = Humans occasionally produce single domain antibodies by the random creation of a stop codon in the light chain. Mitchell Ho and Dimiter Dimitrov at the National Cancer Institute generated human single-domain antibodies targeting various tumor antigens including mesothelin, GPC2 and GPC3 from an engineered human VH domain phage display library. The human single-domain antibodies have been used to create immunotoxins (HN3-PE38, HN3-mPE24, HN3-T20) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells for treating cancer. Blocking the Wnt binding domain on GPC3 by the HN3 human single-domain antibody inhibits Wnt activation in liver cancer cells. Potential applications Single-domain antibodies allow a broad range of applications in biotechnical as well as therapeutic use due to their small size, simple production and high affinity. =Biotechnological and diagnostic= The fusion of a fluorescent protein to a nanobody generates a so-called chromobody. Chromobodies can be used to recognize and trace targets in different compartments of living cells. They can therefore increase the possibilities of live cell microscopy and will enable novel functional studies. The coupling of an anti-GFP Nanobody to a monovalent matrix, called GFP-nanotrap, allows the isolation of GFP-fusion proteins and their interacting partners for further biochemical analyses. Single molecule localization with super-resolution imaging techniques requires the specific delivery of fluorophores into close proximity with a target protein. Due to their large size the use of antibodies coupled to organic dyes can often lead to a misleading signal owing to the distance between the fluorophore and the target protein. The fusion of organic dyes to anti-GFP Nanobodies targeting GFP-tagged proteins allows nanometer spatial resolution and minimal linkage error because of the small size and high affinity. The size dividend of nanobodies also benefits the correlative light-electron microscopy study. Without any permeabilization agent, the cytoplasm of the chemically fixed cells are readily accessible to the fluorophore tagged nanobodies. Their small size also allows them to penetrate deeper into volumetric samples than regular antibodies. High ultrastructural quality is preserved in the tissue that is imaged by fluorescence microscope and then electron microscope. This is especially useful for the neuroscience research that requires both molecular labeling and electron microscopic imaging. In diagnostic biosensor applications nanobodies may be used prospectively as a tool. Due to their small size, they can be coupled more densely on biosensor surfaces. In addition to their advantage in targeting less accessible epitopes, their conformational stability also leads to higher resistance to surface regeneration conditions. After immobilizing single-domain antibodies on sensor surfaces sensing human prostate-specific antigen (hPSA) were tested. The nanobodies outperformed the classical antibodies in detecting clinical significant concentrations of hPSA. To increase the crystallization probability of a target molecule, nanobodies can be used as crystallization chaperones. As auxiliary proteins, they can reduce the conformational heterogeneity by binding and stabilizing just a subset of conformational states. They also can mask surfaces interfering with the crystallization while extending regions that form crystal contacts. =Therapeutic= Nanobodies for photothermal therapy. Nanobodies, which are able to bind tumor antigens like 271x271px Single-domain antibodies have been tested as a new therapeutic tool against multiple targets. In mice infected with influenza A virus subtype H5N1, nanobodies directed against hemaglutinin suppressed replication of the H5N1 virus in vivo and reduced morbidity and mortality. Nanobodies targeting the cell receptor binding domain of the virulence factors toxin A and toxin B of Clostridium difficile were shown to neutralize cytopathic effects in fibroblasts in vitro. Nanobody conjugates recognizing antigen presenting cells have been successfully used for tumor detection or targeted antigen delivery to generate strong immune response. Orally available single-domain antibodies against E. coli-induced diarrhoea in piglets have been developed and successfully tested. Other diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, such as inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer, are also possible targets for orally available single-domain antibodies. Detergent-stable species targeting a surface protein of Malassezia furfur have been engineered for use in anti- dandruff shampoos. As an approach for photothermal therapy nanobodies binding to the HER2 antigen, which is overexpressed in breast and ovarian cancer cells, were conjugated to branched gold nanoparticles (see figure). Tumor cells were destroyed photothermally using a laser in a test environment. Caplacizumab, a single-domain antibody targeting von Willebrand factor is in clinical trials for the prevention of thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome. A Phase II study examining ALX-0081 in high risk percutaneous coronary intervention has started in September 2009. Ablynx expects that their nanobodies might cross the blood–brain barrier and permeate into large solid tumours more easily than whole antibodies, which would allow for the development of drugs against brain cancers. A nanobody that tightly binds to the RBD domain of the spike protein of betacoronaviruses (including CoV-19) and blocks interactions of spike with the cell receptor ACE2, has been recently identified Application of various single domain antibodies (nanobodies) for the prevention and treatment of infection by various highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs) has been reported time and again. The prospects, potency and challenges of deploying nanobodies to bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and akin have been recently highlighted.

Biography His father, (1804-1892) was a naval officer and his mother, Theresine (1815-1873), was an amateur painter. His interest in history began when he was still very young and he discovered that one of his ancestors had participated in the Skirmish at Bender. At first, he planned to follow in his father's footsteps and pursue a military career. In 1864, he was assigned to an infantry regiment in Värmland as an underlöjtnant but, whenever possible, he also took art classes at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts. In 1870, he decided to resign his commission and become an artist. Later, he studied with Ferdinand Fagerlin in Düsseldorf and Léon Bonnat in Paris, where he chose to settle in 1873.Svensk uppslagsbok, Malmö 1930 His first success came at the Exposition Universelle (1878), where he displayed a somewhat romanticized scene featuring the body of the late Swedish King, Karl XII, being carried home. It brought him a medal and it was purchased by the Russian Grand Duke Konstantin, but was returned to Sweden after the Russian Revolution and is now on display at the Göteborgs konstmuseum.Göteborgs konstmuseum Later that same year, he was elected a member of the Royal Academy and married Amalia Katarina Jaeder. Their daughter, (1878-1954), also became a painter. He was named a Professor at the Academy in 1887, and served as its Director from 1899 to 1911.Svensk uppslagsbok, Malmö 1939Gustaf Olof Cederström Konstnärslexikonett Amanda In 1894, he became involved in a project to paint historical scenes for the stairwell of the Nationalmuseum, but a conflict over subject matter arose with Carl Larsson, the other artist proposed for the project, and he eventually refused the assignment. In 1906, he did create scenes for the Royal Dramatic Theatre. He was also an author.

History The entranceway to the main structure, showing wooden reinforcements Inside the dolmen Research has dated this dolmen structure to between 4000-3000 B.C., concurrent with the megalithic construction associated with the region of Évora. It is linked to the dolmen culture of the Anta Grande da Comenda da Igreja (Great Dolmen of Comenda da Igreja in the municipality of Montemor-o- Novo. In 1965, there were archaeological excavations completed by Henrique Leonor Pina, resulting in the discovery of a number of artefacts that were transferred to the museum of Évora. These excavations, which created some controversy (due to techniques used to examine the structure), unearthed slate tablets, necklaces, crosiers, copper objects, ceramics and carinated bowls. Due to its importance, the Great Dolmen of Zambujeiro () was declared a national monument by the Portuguese government in 1971 (Decree-Law No.516/71, 22 November 1971). With fears of deterioration of the archaeological site, a metallic enclosure was constructed to protect the site (1983). A secondary series of excavations were completed between 1989-1990, under the direction of Carlos Tavares da Silva (although there have been no publications on its results). Architecture The Great Dolmen is located one kilometre north of the historical Convent of Bom Jesus of Valverde, in the civil parish of Nossa Senhora da Tourega, around Herdade da Mitra (Valverde). This monument illustrates the organizational and technical capabilities of the Neolithic settlements and cultural groups of the period. Consists of an irregular free- standing plan, composed of a single-chamber, articulated horizontal body with polygonal chamber and rectangular corridor. The funerary chamber and access corridor are covered by size-specific slabs of rock: large granite slabs over the funerary chamber and smaller rock slabs on the entrance corridor. The principal face, orientated towards the east, is constituted by the projection of the corridor over the chamber face. The remaining façades are obstructed by the observation mound, which still covers almost the entire structure except for the eastern side. The polygonal chamber, consisting of seven 8 metre-high pillars, is followed by smaller 2 metre-high slabs forming a 12 metre long (1.5 metre wide) corridor. The 7 metre coverage slab (acting as a roof), lies broken on the mound, with a sag on its western edge. The entrance was marked by a large menhir, decorated with dimples, which is now lying on the ground.

Or see kneecap. The New England Common Assessment Program (universally abbreviated NECAP, and generally pronounced \\"knee cap\\") was a series of reading, writing, mathematics and science achievement tests, administered annually, which were developed in response to the Federal No Child Left Behind Act. Starting in 2005, school students in New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont participated in NECAP, and Maine joined the assessment program in 2009. It was a collaborative project of the New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont departments of education, with assistance from the National Center for the Improvement of Educational Assessments. Measured Progress, an assessment contractor from Dover, New Hampshire, coordinates production, administration, scoring and reporting. The NECAP tests measured students’ academic knowledge and skills relative to Grade Expectations which were created by teams of teachers representing the original three participating states. Student scores were reported at four levels of academic achievement; Proficient with Distinction, Proficient, Partially Proficient and Substantially Below Proficient. Reading and math were assessed in grades 3–8 and 11, writing was assessed in grades 5, 8 and 11, and science was assessed in grades 4, 8 and 11. The reading, math and writing tests were administered each year in October. The science tests were administered in May. Students in Maine did not participate in the science NECAP; instead, Maine students in grades 5 and 8 took the science MEA (Maine Education Assessment). The states supporting this initiative planned to phase over to the newer Common Core State Standards Initiative by 2014. Purpose NECAP provided assessment results for students in Grades 3-8 and 11 based on a common set of grade expectations. The scores served a variety of purposes, including – * Measurement of individual student achievement and progress * Program evaluation and systems-change * Public reporting * School accountability and identification of schools in need of improvement Approach NECAP tests were made up of multiple choice, short answer and constructed response questions. The writing test also included an extended response essay question, and the science test included an inquiry session that required students to analyze experimental data. Every NECAP test question was aligned to a specific grade expectation. Teacher Involvement One major goal of NECAP was to create tests relevant to classroom instruction. To accomplish this goal, teachers were involved in test development in a variety of ways, including: * Development of the Grade Expectations * Review of test items for alignment with the grade expectations, as well as absence of bias * Setting standards (determining the test score needed to be considered “proficient’) Content The NECAP tests provided broad scores in reading, writing, mathematics and science literacy, as well as the following strand or domain scores: * The Reading assessment addressed Word Identification, Vocabulary, Initial Understanding and Analysis/Interpretation. Comprehension was measured using both literary and informational text. * The Mathematics assessment addressed Numbers and Operations, Geometry and Measurement, Functions and Algebra, and Data, Statistics and Probability * The Writing assessment addressed a variety of writing genre including narratives, informational writing and response to both literary and informational text. Writing conventions and structures of writing were also assessed. * The Science assessment addressed four domains: Life Science, Physical Science, Earth Space Science and Inquiry. Science inquiry The inquiry section of the NECAP Science test provided a unique approach to assessing scientific literacy. Students in grades 4 and 8 work in pairs to conduct an actual, hands-on science experiment (11th graders use authentic data from existing research). Then, working independently, they use their data to analyze results, test hypotheses and make predictions. In other words, the test requires students to think and act like scientists.

Jones's most famous musical was The Geisha, but several of his pieces were among the most popular shows of the era, enjoying long runs, international tours and revivals. In 1892, after nine years of conducting touring companies of British operettas for Alfred Cellier and George Edwardes, Edwardes engaged Jones to conduct several operettas and musical comedies in London. Jones had begun composing incidental music and supplemental songs for some of the shows he conducted and even wrote scores of his own in 1889 and 1892. In 1893, one of his songs, \\"Linger Longer, Loo\\", composed for the 1892 burlesque Don Juan at the Gaiety Theatre, became popular throughout the English-speaking world. Jones's first hit show was A Gaiety Girl (1893), one of the first major successes of the Edwardian musical comedy genre. A series of Jones hits followed: An Artist's Model (1894), The Geisha (1896), A Greek Slave (1898) and San Toy (1899). After this, Jones had less frequent and intense successes, but his more popular shows included My Lady Molly (1902), See See (1906), King of Cadonia (1908), The Girl from Utah (1913) and The Happy Day (1916). Life and career Theatre poster Jones was born in Islington, London. His father, James Sidney Jones, Sr. (1837–1914) originally of Suffolk, was a military bandmaster. His mother was Ann Jones, née Eycott. As a child, Jones moved frequently as his father was transferred to new military stations in England and Ireland. The young Jones learned to play a variety of instruments in the band. In Dublin, he studied with Sir Robert Stewart (1825–1894) of Trinity College. The family later moved to Leeds, where his father became conductor of the Leeds Rifles, was the musical director of the Leeds Grand Theatre and later conducted a band and the Spa Orchestra at Harrogate.\\"Historical Harrogate Music\\", The Harrogate Band (1996) Jones was the eldest son and second of six children. His youngest brother, Guy Sidney Jones (1875–1959), also became a conductor and composer whose musical scores included The Gay Gordons (1907).Lamb, Andrew. \\"Sidney Jones (1861–1946); The Geisha\\", sleeve notes from the Hyperion recording of The Geisha (1998) In 1885, Jones married Kate Linley, an actress, and the couple produced five children.Gänzl, Kurt. \\"Jones, (James) Sidney (1861–1946)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 18 September 2008, =Early career= Jones gained his first professional experience playing the clarinet in his father's band and orchestra. He also gave piano lessons. In 1882, he was hired as a conductor for tours of operettas and other musical theatre pieces, such as Robert Planquette's Les Cloches de Corneville and a popular American musical show, Fun on the Bristol. He next toured with the Vokes family and also composed incidental music and songs for their farcical entertainment. In Camp.\\"Sidney Jones\\" at the British Musical Theatre site (2004) In 1886, actress/producer Kate Santley engaged Jones as musical director for the tour of her musical Vetah. Jones then worked for Henry Leslie for nearly four years as conductor of tours of Alfred Cellier's comic opera hit Dorothy (starring Lucy Carr Shaw, sister to George Bernard Shaw), Doris and The Red Hussar. He was then music director for a tour of the Gaiety Theatre piece Little Jack Sheppard under the management of comedian J. J. Dallas. After that, George Edwardes hired him as musical director for the Gaiety Theatre's 1891 tour of America and Australia, conducting the burlesques Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué and Cinder-Ellen Up-too- Late. He briefly returned to conducting in the British provinces, but in 1892, after nine years of touring, Edwardes hired Jones to conduct the musical In Town at the Prince of Wales Theatre on London's West End. He next was musical director for another West End musical, Morocco Bound (1893), and for the London production of The Gay Parisienne (1896). =First composing successes= Yvette Guilbert singing \\"Linger Longer, Loo\\" At the same time as these conducting engagements, Jones had begun composing incidental music and songs as needed for the shows he conducted. In 1889, he wrote the musical score for the pantomime Aladdin II, which played at Leeds. When Edwardes's touring company produced Cinder Ellen in Australia, Jones wrote a dance number that was added to Meyer Lutz's score. Jones also composed an operetta, Our Family Legend (1892), with a libretto by Reginald Stockton, which was produced at Brighton. In 1893, one of his songs, \\"Linger Longer, Loo\\" was added to Lutz's 1892 burlesque Don Juan at the Gaiety Theatre.The Times obituary, 30 January 1946, p. 7 The song became popular throughout the English-speaking world and inspired a drawing by Toulouse-Lautrec of Yvette Guilbert singing it. In 1893, for A Gaiety Girl, with a libretto by Owen Hall, Edwardes gave Jones the opportunity to write the music, and the result was a hit show that enjoyed a long run and toured internationally, setting the trend for a new genre of popular musical theatre that came to be known as Edwardian musical comedy. The ballad \\"Sunshine above\\" from the show was popular parlour song. Jones's style was similar in technique to the music of Arthur Sullivan and Cellier, which Jones had conducted for so long, but it was lighter and breezier, appealing to the popular tastes of the time. =Daly's Theatre years and later years= Jones soon became house composer and music director for George Edwardes's new Daly's Theatre. After A Gaiety Girl, Jones again collaborated with Hall and lyricist Harry Greenbank to produce another success, An Artist's Model (1894), which ran for fifteen months. This was followed by three of the most successful musical comedies of the 1890s: The Geisha (1896), A Greek Slave (1898), and San Toy (1899). Jones's musical plays were \\"written in a more musically substantial style than the featherweight entertainment given at the Gaiety. Their librettos sported a solid and serious romantic backbone (confided to the baritone hero Hayden Coffin and the soprano Marie Tempest) alongside their comic and soubrette elements, and the scores which Jones provided included, alongside the lighter material, numbers sentimental and dramatic, as well as some impressive and vocally demanding concerted ensembles and finales.\\" Cover of the Vocal Score Jones song from The Geisha, \\"The Amorous Goldfish\\" became an oft-sung hit, as did several of his other songs for these shows. The Geisha and San Toy took advantage of the fad for oriental settings in musical theatre that had reached a peak in Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado in 1885. These two musicals were frequently revived, recorded and widely toured in Europe as well as throughout the English- speaking world. The former became the most frequently-performed English- language work of musical theatre in Europe for many decades.Toye, Francis. Letter to The Times, 2 February 1946, p. 5 The piece figures prominently in Anton Chekhov's popular short story, The Lady with the Dog, and it was adapted as a Russian film in 1959 that featured its music, including \\"The Amorous Goldfish\\". Other musicals followed, but Jones's only real successes during this period were My Lady Molly (produced by Jones) in 1902 and King of Cadonia in 1908 (produced by Frank Curzon), although See See (with a book by Charles Brookfield and lyrics by Adrian Ross) did reasonably well in 1906 at the Prince of Wales Theatre.Dangerfield, Fred. \\"See-See\\" feature in The Play Pictorial, volume 8, pp. 85–88, Greening & Co., Ltd. (1906), accessed 21 April 2010 As musical director at the Empire Theatre, Jones wrote the ballets, The Bugle Call (1905) and Cinderella (1906), which was danced at Christmas-time. Later, back at the light-hearted Gaiety Theatre, with The Girl from Utah in 1913, and at Daly's Theatre, with The Happy Day in 1916, Jones achieved two last successes. However, Jones, like his sometime collaborator Lionel Monckton, fell victim to changing musical fashions around the time of World War I, such as syncopated dance rhythms like ragtime, and retired from composition. Jones died at his home at Kew, Surrey, at the age of 84.

Intertribal Wordpath Society. 2009 (21 Feb 2009) It is one of the few Oklahoma tribal languages spoken by children today. HistoryNorthern origins= Kickapoo comes from their word \\"Kiwigapawa\\", which roughly translates into \\"he moves from here to there.\\" The tribe is part of the central Algonquian group and has close ethnic and linguistic connections with the Sac and Fox. The Kickapoo were first recorded in history in about 1667-70 at the confluence of the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers. Under pressure from the Menominee, the Kickapoo and their allies moved south and west into southern Michigan, northern Iowa, Ohio and Illinois. A treaty dated 7 June 1803 between the U.S. Government and the Delaware, Shawnee, Potawatomi, Miami, Eel River, Wea, Kickapoo, Piankeshaw, and Kaskaskia tribes occupying the country watered by the Ohio, Wabash and Miami Rivers and a subsequent treaty dated 7 August 1803 ceded lands previously granted in the Treaty of Greenville in 1795 by General Anthony Wayne, and Fort Wayne and Vincennes, Indiana. By these treaties and succeeding treaties in 1809, 1815, 1816, 1819, and 1820 the tribe ceded all their lands on the Wabash, White and Vermilion Rivers and moved into Missouri on the Osage River. =Resettlement on the Plains= A mere decade later, in 1832, the tribe ceded their lands in Missouri and were granted a \\"permanent\\" home south of the Delaware Nation in Kansas near Fort Leavenworth. Around the same time as the Kickapoo moved into Kansas, some of them went to Texas, invited to settle there by the Spanish colonial governor to serve as a buffer between Mexico and American expansionists. The Mexican War of Independence and the Texas Revolution proved that the tide of settlers would not be stopped by the few hundred Kickapoo. At the conclusion of the Texas Revolution, these groups moved south into Mexico. In 1854 the eastern portion of the Kansas lands was ceded to the United States leaving the Kickapoo the western 150,000 acres. Two provisions of this treaty were to have long-lasting effects on the tribe. The treaty authorized a survey of the Kickapoo lands which could be used as the basis for fee simple allotment and it granted a railroad right-of-way across the reservation. Using these two clauses as a basis, the local agent, William Badger, convinced the Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles E. Mix that the Kickapoo were desirous of having their lands allotted. Considering that the tribe had always held their lands in common, it is unlikely that the tribe truly wanted allotment. However, in light of Badger's persuasion, Mix directed that allotment proceed if 1) the Indians paid for the costs of surveying and allotting the land, 2) 80 acres was allotted to each head of household, and 3) any lands remaining after allotment of the Kansas Kickapoo be reserved for resettlement of the Mexican Kickapoo. Holding the lands not allotted for the Southern Kickapoo, was not in the interests of the railroad and Badger began pressuring tribal members for allotment. Though they complained, it was a political election, not the tribal issues with their agent, that removed Badger from office and replaced him with his brother-in-law Charles B. Keith in 1861.Gibson (2006), p 125-127 Keith was a political ally of Senator Samuel C. Pomeroy who was the president of the Atchison and Pike's Peak Railroad, the central section of the Transcontinental railroad, which had been formed in 1859. The railroad wanted to gain the right-of-way across the Kickapoo Reservation and title to any surplus lands when the reservation was allotted. Pomeroy and Keith both met with and wrote letters to Commissioner Mix urging allotment and by 1862, a treaty was again made with the Kickapoo. The 28 June 1862 agreement allowed for Chiefs to receive 320 acres, heads of households to receive 160 acres and all other tribe members to get 40 acres, with the bulk of the remaining 125,000 acres to be sold to the railroad. Those who chose not to accept allotment could continue to hold their lands in common until such time as an arrangement could be made to locate a new reserve in Oklahoma, i.e. Indian Territory, and any Southern Kickapoo had one year to return to Kansas and take up their allotment, or it would be forfeit. When news of the treaty being approved broke, protest erupted. The Kickapoo indicated that they were unaware that the agreement had been reached and thought that they were still negotiating terms. The Kansas Attorney General, Warren William Guthrie, launched a grand jury hearing. The charges were considered serious enough that allotment was suspended and the new Commissioner of Indian Affairs, William P. Dole, appointed in 1863, traveled to Kansas to investigate. In the hearings that followed, allegations were made that Guthrie's real interest in the matter stemmed from his involvement with a rival railroad the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad Corporation. Dole returned to Washington and submitted his report to President Lincoln on 4 April 1864.Gibson (2006), p 129-135 Some of the frustrated Kickapoo, decided to leave Kansas, and a group of about 700 headed for Mexico to join kinsmen there in September, 1864. In 1865 pressure from Pomeroy finally gained the approval to continue with the Kickapoo allotment, though the tribe resisted. By 1869, only 93 Kansas Kickapoo had accepted fee simple allotment, the remainder preferring to continue holding their lands in common.Gibson (2006), p 135 Though a small band, approximately 50 tribesmen returned from Mexico to the Kansas Reservation before the forfeit period lapsed, they settled on the common lands briefly, but then left before claiming their allotments. They later joined the Kickapoo in Indian Territory in 1874.Gibson (2006), p 137-138 In 1875, a group of 114 of the Mexican Kickapoos were returned to the Kansas Reservation. =Texas Settlement= The first Southern Kickapoo migration occurred around the time that the tribe was settled in Kansas. They traveled across the southern plains, fighting the Seminole in Florida around 1837 and wandered into Texas in search of horses from the Comanche. In 1850, they agreed to act as a buffer between Mexicans, invading Texas settlers and the Lipan, Comanche and other tribes in Northern Coahuila. As a reward for their service, the Spanish governor awarded them a land grant at Hacienda del Nacimiento near the settlement of Santa Rosa (now known as Melchor Múzquiz).Ricky (1999), p224 At the peak of their strength, the southern Kickapoo, numbered about 1500 and by 1860 were living in a swath from the Canadian and Washita Rivers in Indian Territory to the Sabine and Brazos Rivers in Texas to the Remolino River in northern Mexico.Gibson (2006), p 143 In 1864, about 700 Kickapoo, frustrated with the duplicitous actions of agents and their railroad colleagues in Kansas left to join their kinsmen in Mexico. Confederate scouts picked up their trail and reported their findings to Captain Henry Fossett and Captain S. S. Totten, leader of a group of Texas Militiamen. On 8 January 1865, the Texans charged the Kickapoo at Dove Creek, were engaged in battle for a brief half hour and then retreated. The Kickapoo had lost about 15 warriors and the Texans twice as many men. In 1868, a report to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs indicated that there were approximately 800 Kickapoo living in Mexico and claimed that the Mexican Kickapoo were responsible for raids in the western part of Texas. In an effort to pacify the Texas citizens and ward off difficulties with Mexico, the U.S. determined to retrieve the Kickapoo. Congress passed P.L. 16 Stat. 359 an Act of 15 July 1870 to appropriate funds for the Secretary of the Interior to collect Kickapoo in Texas and Mexico and establish them in the Indian Territory. A second Act, P.L. 16 Stat. 569, passed by Congress on 3 March 1871 appropriated funds for the resettlement and subsistence of the Kickapoo on reservations within the United States. Armed with these two Acts, Indian Agent John D. Miles, went with a delegation of Kansas Kickapoo to try to persuade the Indians at Santa Rosa to return to the United States. Mexican authorities refused to allow Miles to speak with the Kickapoo as the residents of Santa Rosa saw them as their only defense from other marauding tribes.McKellar (1994), pp 225-226 In 1873, after complaints were again received indicating that Mexican authorities were using the Kickapoo to hide the theft of Texas cattle by Mexicans, another attempt was made to bring the Kickapoo to Indian Territory. Special Agents H. M. Atkinson and Col. T. G. Williams went to Saltillo, to negotiate directly with Governor Victoriano Cepeda Camacho. Though citizens and the Legislature of Coahuila did not support the action, Cepeda appointed an officer to assist the agents and gave him a proclamation that they were to be assisted by the officials and citizenry. While the delegation was en route to Santa Rosa, a party of Americans under the command of General MacKenzie attacked the Kickapoo, thinking that they were a group of raiding Lipan, which did not make the Kickapoo receptive to relocating when the agents arrived. In the autumn of 1874, Atkinson and Williams were finally able to persuade a group of about 300 Mexican Kickapoo to resettle. =Relocation to Oklahoma= The Mexican Kickapoos were to be removed to the Indian Territory, in the present State of Oklahoma to a location on the north fork of the Canadian River and provided with farm equipment to begin cultivation. The adjustment was difficult and by 1883, they had still not been provided with a permanent title to the lands they were occupying. By an executive order issued 15 August 1883, the Kickapoo were granted the lands that they had been occupying near the southwest corner of the Sac and Fox Reservation which had been ceded in 1866 by the Muscogee (Creek) Nation for resettlement of freedmen and others. Four years later with the passage of the Dawes Act pressure began mounting to secure fee simple title for the Oklahoma Kickapoo. On 21 June 1891 the tribe agreed to cede their reservation in exchange for 80 acre allotments for each tribesman. The Kickapoo were \\"bitterly opposed\\" to allotment and fought the process until 1894. 283 Kickapoo received eighty-acre plots leaving 184,133 surplus acres for non- Indian settlement. In 1895, after the Kickapoo finally consented to allotment, the final Oklahoma Land Run occurred on 23 May 1895. The Land Run of 1895 was the smallest of Oklahoma's five land runs, with approximately 10,000 participants. Because of the large number of contested claims and the problems with Sooners the remaining two land openings in Oklahoma were lotteries. 20th centuryIndian Reorganization Act= In 1936, the tribe organized as the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma, under the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act. They adopted a Constitution and by-laws by a vote of 64 for and 26 against on 18 September 1937, which established the offices of Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary, Treasurer, and one councilman. =Claims Commission= On 13 August 1946 the Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-726, ch. 959, passed. Its purpose was to settle for all time any outstanding grievances or claims the tribes might have against the U.S. for treaty breaches, unauthorized taking of land, dishonorable or unfair dealings, or inadequate compensation. Claims had to be filed within a five-year period, and most of the 370 complaints that were submitted were filed at the approach of the 5-year deadline in August, 1951. At least 6 claims were filed by the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma with the Claims Commission — some on their own behalf, and some in conjunction with the Kickapoo Tribe of Kansas or other tribes in which they had made joint treaties with the U. S. Government. The two biggest awards were for \\"unconscionable consideration\\" (the government severely underpaid for ceded lands) from the Treaty of 1854 and the Treaty of 1866. Though the distribution was approved via passage of Public Law 92-467 in 1972, appeals were pending into the late 1970s, as the government was offsetting award amounts due to the Oklahoma and Kansas Kickapoo for expenses incurred in capturing and relocating Mexican Kickapoo during the Texas Revolution. The US government had repatriated some of the Mexican Kickapoos to a reservation in Oklahoma and a later group to Kansas in the 1860s and 1870s. The final distribution plan was not approved until 1980. =Mexican Kickapoo subgroup established= In 1979 the Mexican Kickapoo who were dual residents requested clarification of their status as they had no clear legal status in either the United States or Mexico.Ricky (1999), p 172 An Act was passed in 1983 by Congress which recognized them as a distinct subgroup of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma and granted federal recognition to the Texas Kickapoo. A 1985 law gave the Texas band the option of selecting Mexican or U.S. citizenship. 145 of the tribemembers chose to become U.S. citizens and the remaining 500 or so chose to obtain Mexican citizenship. The interaction between the Mexican Kickapoo and Oklahoma tribe remains strong. Mexican Kickapoos use the health services of the tribal clinic in McLoud, Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Kickapoos travel for the ceremonial seasons in February and March to Mexico.

Li flirts with Dudley, the maid at the British Consulate, but Li is in love with Ko Fan, one of the Emperor's female guards, a service into which all noble daughters are conscripted. The Mandarin, however, has got around the conscription law for his favourite daughter, San Toy, by raising her as a boy. However, the student Fo Hop discovers the secret, and his price for silence is San Toy's hand in marriage. The Mandarin allows this on the condition that no one must ever know that San Toy is a girl, cleverly preventing the marriage from happening. San Toy is in love with the Consul's son, naval Captain Bobby Preston, but a marriage between the two would never be permitted by either of their fathers. Bobby must leave San Toy to go to Peking on his father's business and departs sadly. Fo Hop, discovering their romance, tells San Toy that he will turn her into the model Chinese wife. A new edict from the Emperor is announced, ordering that now all sons, as well as daughters, of Mandarins must join a new regiment in Peking, so San Toy must depart for Peking, where she will admit her sex, entering the girls' regiment, and can see Bobby. The Mandarin declares that he will also go to Peking and petition the Emperor to return his daughter. ;Act II In the Emperor's Palace at Peking, San Toy is introduced to the Emperor, and he is charmed by her, telling her that she will be treated with favour. Li arrives, followed by Dudley, who entertains the Emperor. The Preston family and consulate staff arrive. Poppy Preston, the Consul's daughter, explains Western marriage customs. San Toy assures Bobby that she is still his, and Yen How and his wives also arrive and are pleased to see that San Toy is receiving the amorous attentions of the Emperor. However, it is declared that the Emperor is astrologically ill-suited to San Toy but well-suited to one of the other girls, leaving San Toy free to marry Bobby, Li to marry his old love Ko Fan, and Yen How to be promoted to Viceroy.

History The Texas Kickapoo's history is intertwined with that of Texas. According to the Handbook of Texas, the Tribe settled in Texas in the early 1800s at the invitation of the Spanish government, which was hoping native tribes would provide a buffer against American settlement in the region. By 1839, however, most Kickapoos had left Texas for Mexico or Indian Territory as a treaty proposed by Sam Houston was never ratified. The Tribe was granted land in Nacimiento, Coahuila, by the Mexican government in 1852. Tribal members returned to Texas periodically and over the years became seasonal migrant farmers in the U.S. The Tribe was officially recognized by the Texas Indian Commission under Senate Bill 168, 65th Legislature, Regular Session, in 1977. In 1982, they were recognized as an official sub-group of the Oklahoma Kickapoo Indian Tribe, enabling them to acquire their own reservation, under control of the Bureau of Indian Affairs instead of the state of Texas.

The score was composed by Sidney Jones to a libretto by Owen Hall, with lyrics by Harry Greenbank. Additional songs were written by Lionel Monckton and James Philp. The Geisha opened in 1896 at Daly's Theatre in London's West End, produced by George Edwardes. The original production had the second longest run of any musical up to that time. The cast starred Marie Tempest and C. Hayden Coffin, with dancer Letty Lind and comic Huntley Wright. The show was an immediate success abroad, with an 1896 production in New York and numerous tours and productions in Europe and beyond. It continued to be popular until World War II and even beyond to some degree. The most famous song from the show is \\"The Amorous Goldfish\\".Gänzl (1986), p. 589 Background and productions The success of An Artist's Model in 1895 had set the pattern for the Hall, Greenbank and Jones Edwardian musical comedies. Edwardes immediately put his team to work on a new musical. The Geisha was first performed on 25 April 1896 at Daly's Theatre in London, produced by George Edwardes. The original production ran for 760 performances. This run, the second longest of any musical up to that time, would be beaten three years later by Edwardes' San Toy, which was written by Jones, Greenbank and Monckton. The cast included Marie Tempest in the role of O Mimosa San and Letty Lind as the dancing soubrette Molly Seamore. C. Hayden Coffin played Lieutenant Reginald Fairfax, Huntley Wright played Wun-Hi, and later Rutland Barrington and Scott Russell joined the cast. Direction was by J. A. E. Malone, choreography by Willie Warde and costumes by Percy Anderson. The music director was Ernest Ford. Edwardes took advantage of the continuing fascination of the public with the orient that had brought such success to Gilbert and Sullivan in The Mikado.Hicks, William L. \\"Social Discourse in the Savoy Theatre's Productions of The Nautch Girl (1891) and Utopia Limited (1893): Exoticism and Victorian Self-Reflection (2003) However, The Geisha was a more topical entertainment than The Mikado, and despite its great initial popularity, The Geisha and the many other topical oriental Edwardian musicals, such as San Toy, A Chinese Honeymoon and even Chu Chin Chow did not endure through the decades as well as The Mikado. Gaiety Girls in The Geisha: Alice Davis (l), Blanche Massey (c), Hetty Hamer (r) Hayden Coffin as Reginald Fairfax Jones, aiming for a light, breezy score, kept each of his musical numbers under three minutes, except that the finales ran to about five. In addition to oriental shadings, Jones's music borrowed from continental European dance rhythms. Hall had taken some of the sauciness out of his style, since An Artist's Model, and evolved a combination of sprightly, up-to-date comedy and old-fashioned romance, into which he would insert parodies when the opportunity arose. Indeed, the Daly's Theatre shows were more romantic in character than the sillier Gaiety Theatre shows. Still, these musicals hewed to most of the features that made the Gaiety Theatre shows popular, especially Edwardes' pretty Gaiety Girls, dressed in the latest fashions. Many of the best-known London couturiers designed costumes for stage productions. The illustrated periodicals were eager to publish photographs of the actresses in the latest stage hits, and so the theatre became an excellent way for clothiers to publicise their latest fashions. The Gaiety Girls were, as The Sketch noted in its 1896 review of The Geisha, \\"clothed in accordance with the very latest and most extreme modes of the moment, and the result is a piquantly striking contrast, as you may imagine.\\"Information about the famous costume designs of the musicals The next musical for the Hall, Greenbank and Jones team moved from Japan to Ancient Rome, with A Greek Slave.

Reggie Fairfax of the Royal Navy is lonely. He begins to spend much of his free time at the Tea House of Ten Thousand Joys which is run by Chinaman Wun-Hi. There he meets the lovely geisha O Mimosa San, with whom he builds a friendship, but she is in love with Katana, a soldier, so she discourages him with her tale of 'The Amorous Goldfish'. However, Reggie gives Mimosa a lesson in kissing. The relationship does not go unnoticed by Lady Constance Wynne, a touring English aristocrat, who catches Reggie engaged in his tête-a-tête with Mimosa and reminds him that he is engaged to Molly. Lady Constance contacts Molly, telling her she had better come to the Orient as quickly as possible. The local overlord Marquis Imari, who also fancies Mimosa, is annoyed that his intended bride is consorting with the newly arrived British sailors, and he orders that the teahouse be closed and the girls be sold off. The Marquis himself is pursued by the French interpreter Juliette. Molly arrives unexpectedly. Left alone, Molly is joined by Mimosa and Lady Constance who tell her how fond Reggie has become of one geisha in particular. Mimosa then suggests that Molly should dress up as a geisha herself to try and win him back. It is now time for the sale of the geishas' indentures. The Marquis tries to buy Mimosa for himself, but Lady Constance manages to outbid him to keep her out of his clutches. Unfortunately, she can't stop him from purchasing lot number 2, a new geisha called Roli Poli whom nobody has seen before. Only after the Marquis has made his purchase is it revealed that this geisha is actually Molly in disguise. ;Act II In the chrysanthemum gardens of the Imari palace, Molly, still disguised as Roli Poli, awaits her impending marriage to the Marquis, who has become much attracted to her. Mimosa proposes a plan to save Molly from her fate: Mimosa will sneak into the bridal suite and exchange the veiled Molly for another veiled bride - Juliette, the French interpreter. The wedding ceremony starts, and the plan is put into effect: Juliette is exchanged with Molly, and the Marquis unwittingly marries the wrong bride. On discovering the ruse, he accepts his fate philosophically, concluding that \\"every man is disappointed in his wife at some time or other\\". Mimosa is now free to marry her lover Katana, and Molly is re-united with Reggie, declaring that she would never marry a foreign nobleman when she could have a British sailor.

Coghill performed much of the empirical work supporting the theory that development of movement is not simply the accumulation of individualized reflexes, but rather a result of the differentiation of generalized total movement. Early years Born in Beaucoup, Illinois, as the fifth child of John Waller and Elisabeth Tucker Coghill, George started college at Shurtleff College in Alton, Illinois.George E. Coghill, 69, Educator, Author: Ex-Secretary of University of Kansas School of Medicine. The New York Times, July 24, 1941. He later transferred to and graduated from Brown University with a bachelors and two doctorate degrees. In 1899, Coghill began teaching biology at the University of New Mexico. In New Mexico, he met Muriel Anderson and the two would wed in 1900, with the marriage producing five children. In 1902, he was hired as a professor at Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon. Here, he acted as the corresponding secretary for the Oregon State Academy of Sciences. He remained there until 1906 when he moved further down the Willamette Valley and began teaching at Willamette University in Salem. He would later teach at Denison University and at the University of Kansas. Scientific career Coghill studied Ambystoma tigrinum (the tiger salamander), to investigate the relationship between the development of behavior and the development of the nervous system. When observing the development of movement in Ambystoma tigrinum, Coghill noticed that the first observable movements were in the trunk of the Ambystoma embryos. These movements developed over time from unspecific, sometimes spontaneous, myogenic motions to unilateral flexures to concerted motions that resembled swimming. Coghill hypothesized that this movement was the precursor to later feeding behavior or walking behavior. In Coghill's studies, Ambystoma limb movement was first observed as a result of total body movement and was only later observed as a result of individualized movement that resembled locomotion; thus, the movement observed in a fully developed Ambystoma embryo is the result of first generalized movement, then the differentiated movement of specific limbs within the totality of organized movement. Coghill's theory for how the individualization of limb movement emerged from general patterns mirrored that of Sherrington's law of reciprocal innervation; the movement of a specific limb involves the inhibition of activity of the rest of the body and, thus, the movement of a particular limb requires excitation of one part of the body and inhibition of the rest of the body. This behavior was only descriptive towards species-specific Ambystoma somatic movement. Coghill extensively detailed his work on the development and integration of the central and peripheral system (both afferent and efferent pathways) in a series of papers collectively called \\"Correlated anatomical and physiological studies of the growth of the nervous system of Amphibia.\\" In addition to his own scientific studies, Coghill was also a managing editor for the Journal of Comparative Neurology between the years of 1927 and 1933. Death At the time of his death, Coghill was studying how anatomical changes contributed to the development of individual fin movements in killifish and toadfish and limb movements in reptiles and opossums. Though he wasn't able to finish the experiments with these animals, Coghill was anticipating that the differential fin and limb movement developed in a similar fashion as the Ambystoma. At the time of his death, Coghill was also working on a manuscript entitled \\"Principles of Development in Psycho- organismal Behavior.\\" George E. Coghill died in Gainesville, Florida on July 23, 1941. Awards He received the Award of the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal in 1930, from the National Academy of Sciences, for his work entitled Correlated Anatomical and Physiological Studies of the Growth of the Nervous System of Amphibia which he wrote during his time at the University of Kansas . He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1935.

The score was composed by Sidney Jones with additional songs by Lionel Monckton and lyrics by Harry Greenbank and Adrian Ross. The libretto was written by Owen Hall. It starred Marie Tempest, Letty Lind, Hayden Coffin, Scott Russell, Huntley Wright and Rutland Barrington among other popular London stars. The show had a brief Broadway run in 1899. The work's competition in London in 1898 included the long-running musicals A Runaway Girl and The Belle of New York. Background The simple plot of the production was based around the tangled love lives and misunderstandings of a Roman household. The same themes and characterisations would resurface some 70 years later in the Broadway show A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum by Stephen Sondheim.Kurt Gänzl, Review of A Greek Slave, The British Musical Theatre, Vol 1., pp. 668 - 672 A Greek Slave was in the unfortunate position of following The Geisha, also by Sidney Jones. This was the biggest stage hit of its era. Therefore, A Greek Slave is often remembered as being the show that was not as successful as The Geisha, rather than being appreciated on its own merits. Critics have stated that this show has Jones's best score, with additional hit songs by Monckton, noting that the tunes are catchy, and while the lyrics are witty they also show an appreciation of the classical mythology of the set time period.A Greek Slave: Musical Comedy In 2 Acts With Music By Sidney Jones, Operetta Research Center In 1899 Fred C.

His daughter Maia pretends to have the gifts of an oracle, and utters incomprehensible prophecies at a suitable price. Among their servants is one Archias, a talented sculptor, whose most recent achievement is a statue of Eros, God of Love, for which his fellow slave Diomed has acted as model. Maia has fallen in love with Diomed. The princess Antonia comes to the soothsayer in disguise and Maia, egged on by the Prefect Pomponius, who has been spurned by the princess, plans a humiliating trick. She announces to the princess that the God of Love has fallen in love with her. The statue is brought forth, and Heliodorus prepares to 'bring it to life'. Diomed is substituted and serenades the princess. But Heliodorus is planning a double- cross. He disapproves of his daughter's fancy for a slave, and when the seance is over and Maia has intended that Antonia should walk off with the statue, Heliodorus arranges that the real Diomed falls to the princess. But it does her little good. The slave, in his luxurious new surroundings, pines for Maia, and Antonia's love-making goes for nothing. Pomponius, who was anxious to see his marble lady wasting her affection on a marble statue, is furious at the social slight involved, and Heliodorus finds himself in hot water. Eventually, in the middle of the Roman Saturnalia, all is cleared up, and the correct pairs of lovers are united. Musical numbers Act I *No. 1. On the Dial—Chorus of Slaves *No. 2.

It is also acceptable that punctual can, when talking about grammar, mean \\"to be accurate\\". An opposite personality trait is tardiness. According to each culture, there is often an understanding about what is considered an acceptable degree of punctuality. Usually, a small amount of lateness is acceptable; this is commonly about ten or fifteen minutes in Western cultures, but this is not the case in such instances as doctor's appointments or school lessons. In some cultures, such as Japanese society, and settings, such as military ones, expectations may be much stricter. Some cultures have an unspoken understanding that actual deadlines are different from stated deadlines, for example with Africa time. For example, it may be understood in a particular culture that people will turn up an hour later than advertised. In this case, since everyone understands that a 9 pm party will actually start at around 10 pm, no-one is inconvenienced when everyone arrives at 10 pm. In cultures that value punctuality, being late is seen as disrespectful of others' time and may be considered insulting. In such cases, punctuality may be enforced by social penalties, for example by excluding low-status latecomers from meetings entirely. Such considerations can lead on to considering the value of punctuality in econometrics and to considering the effects of non-punctuality on others in queueing theory.

He was a member of the British reggae band Matumbi, and released dub-reggae records under his own name as well as the pseudonym Blackbeard.Thompson, Dave (2002), \\"Reggae & Caribbean Music\\", Backbeat Books, . He is most widely known for his decades-spanning collaborations with Linton Kwesi Johnson. Biography Born in Saint Peter, Barbados, in 1953, Bovell moved to South London and became immersed in Jamaican culture, particularly dub music, setting up his own Jah Sufferer sound system.Larkin, Colin (1998), The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , pp. 35–36. Running the sound system brought trouble from the police and Bovell was imprisoned for six months on remand, but was later released on appeal. Bovell was friends at school with future rock musicians including keyboardist Nick Straker and record producer Tony Mansfield, both of whom later worked with Bovell. He formed Matumbi in the mid-1970s. Bovell also worked as an engineer at Dip Records, the precursor to the Lovers Rock label, and he was a key figure in the early days of the lovers rock genre. He is also known for attempting to fuse disco rhythms with reggae, most notably with the hit song \\"Silly Games\\" by Janet Kay. According to Bovell, he wrote \\"Silly Games\\" with the sole intent of it being a hit song. He has produced albums by a wide variety of artists including I-Roy, The Thompson Twins, Sharon Shannon, Alpha Blondy, Bananarama, The Pop Group, Fela Kuti, The Slits, Orange Juice and Madness. He has collaborated with poet, Linton Kwesi Johnson for much of his working life. Bovell also co-wrote and co-produced the majority of material by British reggae singer Bobby Kray. In 1980, he wrote the score for Franco Rosso's film Babylon. Bovell has also written music for the 1983 television drama The Boy Who Won the Pools and Global Revolution (2006). In the BBC's Reggae Britannia, Bovell related a tale of strange goings on in the leafy London suburb of Barnes, where the John Hassell Recordings studio was based in a residential house, in a quiet street at 21 Nassau Road.

Indian Expeditionary Force D, mostly made up of Indian units and under the command of Gen. Sir John Nixon, had met with success in Mesopotamia since landing at Al Faw upon the Ottoman Empire's Declaration of War on November 5, 1914. One of the primary reasons for initiating the campaign in Mesopotamia was to defend the oil refinery at Abadan at the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab. Adopting a forward defence policy, the British army under General Townshend fought off a series of small Ottoman forces. Then after a year of a string of defeats, the Ottoman forces were able to halt the British advance in two days of hard fighting at Ctesiphon. Battleground Ctesiphon lies on the Western bank of the Tigris River in the barren Iraqi desert, about upstream from Basra, north of Kut al- Amara, and south-east of Baghdad. It is a good defensive position located in a loop of the Tigris river. At the town there are ruins, the remains of the capital of the Parthian and Sassanid Empires. Advance and retreat from Ctesiphon, 1915. The Ottoman forces had formed a well-camouflaged and formidable line of trenches crossing the river. There were two lines of trenches; there was also a ancient wall south of the main line, used for observation by the Ottoman forces. The Ottoman forces consisted of approximately 18,000 men and 52 guns. The overall commander of the Ottoman army in Mesopotamia was Khalil Pasha. The commander in the field for the previous nine months was Lieutenant General Nureddin also called Nur-ud Din Pasha, but the Ottoman army was as of October under the command of Marshal Baron von der Goltz, also called Goltz Pasha, a well known German general, military historian and, for 12 years, a modernizer of the Ottoman army. Baron von der Goltz was old but he was an expert on military matters and had a deep understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the Ottoman army. General Goltz was still making his way to Mesopotamia and it was Nureddin who was in charge at the battle and the British believed he was still the commander. This may have been a factor in the course of events as the British – with considerable justification based on previous experience – thought poorly of Nureddin's skills as a general. Nureddin had four divisions. The 35th and 38th Divisions were predominantly Arab. The 38th Divisions' prewar garrison had been Basra, and the 35th's was Mosul. Nureddin also had the 45th and 51st Divisions, newly raised divisions, which were predominantly Turkish.Edward J. Erickson, Ottoman Army Effectiveness in World War I: a comparative study (Routledge, New York, 2007), 68–74. They were made up of a mixture of active and reserve soldiers. He had about 18,000 total infantry. The British force consisted of the 6th (Poona) Division, at a strength of around 11,000 men. Some British troops had been left behind to garrison the recently captured town and river junction of Kut. The British advance past Kut was slow, partly due to the bad weather and wet ground and partly due to General Townshend's reluctance to advance further. But the Commander-in-Chief of British forces in the region, General Nixon, ordered Townshend to take Baghdad. So, he commenced his march up the Tigris river. British attack plan Townshend's plan of attack was to separate his force into four columns. Three infantry columns, designated columns A, B, and C, were scheduled for a frontal attack on different points of the Ottoman lines. The other column, referred to as the flying column, was made up of a mix of cavalry and infantry, and was supposed to swing around the left flank of the Ottoman lines. The attack was to be supported by two river boats, a gunboat and HMS Firefly. Ottoman defense plan Lieutenant General Nureddin had over 55 days to prepare his defenses, and his forces prepared them well. He deployed his forces in an L shaped formation. The 38th Division occupied the long part of the L. The new and fresh 45th Division held most vulnerable part of the line, the small leg of the L on the left, with one regiment up in the front line trenches and two in reserve. There were 12 strong points along the first trench line, and a complete second line of trenches to fall back into. In general reserve was the veteran 51st Division. The 35th was across the river.Edward J. Erickson, Ordered to Die: A history of the Ottoman Army in the First World War (Greenwood Press, Wesport, CT 2001), 112, 113. The Ottoman artillery was centrally located where it could support his left flank or the central part of his line.Edward J. Erickson, Ottoman Army Effectiveness in World War I: a comparative study (Routledge, New York, 2007), 76,77. The artillery was ordered to fire first on the British gunboats, and then shift fire to support the Ottoman reserves. Movements and the clash Townshend, intending to copy his success at Battle of Es Sinn, ordered a night march in the closing hours of November 21, 1915, with the aim of attacking at dawn on the November 22, The attack happened on schedule but due to poor ground conditions on the west bank the British ended up attacking the much stronger east bank positions. The advance was supposed to be supported by river gunboats, however two things prevented the gun boats from becoming a factor in the battle. First, the Ottoman guns on the west bank rained fire upon them. Secondly, the Tigris was extensively mined and several river obstructions made navigation difficult. At the beginning of the battle, C-Column, the one closest to the river bank came under heavy small arms and artillery fire and failed to reach the first trench line. A-Column, in the middle, was also halted short of the trench line. On the right, B-Column (mainly Punjabis and Gurkhas) reached the first line of trenches, forced the Ottoman forces to retreat and pursued the retreating enemy towards the second line of trenches. Lieutenant General Nureddin committed the reserve regiments of the 45th Division and brought the unengaged 35th Division from the other side of the river to reinforce his lines, and the British-Indian forces were stopped.Edward J. Erickson, Ottoman Army Effectiveness in World War I: a comparative study (Routledge, New York, 2007), 76, 77. Townshend then ordered C-Column to fall back, and try and exploit the breakthrough. This movement was rather complicated and the task was made difficult by Ottoman forces firing into their flank. Meanwhile, the flying column bogged down in inconclusive fighting against Turkish and Arab Cavalry. Here again Nureddin committed his reserves, in this case the 51st Division, to great effect, halting Townshend's flanking attack.Edward J. Erickson, Ottoman Army Effectiveness in World War I: a comparative study (Routledge, New York, 2007), 76. By the end of the day the 6th (Poona) Division had captured the first line of trenches, but the British sustained heavy casualties. The Ottoman forces had also taken heavy casualties but held their position. =Second day= On the second day, Townshend again attempted to break through, with a supporting flank attack. The Ottoman forces again stopped it. They then counter-attacked the British positions with all available forces.Edward J. Erickson, Ordered to Die: A history of the Ottoman Army in the First World War (Greenwood Press, Wesport, CT 2001), 113. The fight was hard, but the British line held. Both armies had taken heavy casualties and all troops had endured two days of intense combat and were exhausted. The Ottoman forces had lost 6,188 killed and wounded.Edward J. Erickson, Ordered to Die: A history of the Ottoman Army in the First World War (Greenwood Press, Wesport, CT 2001), 114. The 51st Division lost 12%, the 35th Division lost 25%, and the 45th Division, which bore the brunt of the British attacks, lost 65% of its strength. =Day three= On November 24, both generals ordered a withdrawal. On the British side, General Townshend concluded he needed to retreat because his losses had been too great to continue the effort to take Baghdad. Lieutenant General Nureddin also concluded he had to retreat due to the heavy losses. When he realized the British were retreating, he turned his army around and sent it in pursuit of the British-Indian forces. Aftermath The 6th (Poona) Division had sustained a 40% casualty rate, losing about 4,600 troops. They were exhausted from the heavy fighting of the past two days and had an effective strength of about 8,500. Townshend decided a retreat back towards Kut was necessary to rebuild the strength of his army. A British soldier, commenting on the attempts of his officers to pronounce the name \\"Ctesiphon\\", wrote “we calls it Pistupon”.Woodward, 1998, pp113 The Ottoman Army had sustained casualties of 6,188, but they had short supply lines and were able to get reinforcements from Baghdad and the northern provinces. Lieutenant General Nureddin, learning that the British were also retreating, turned his army around and pursued the British. The Ottoman forces under the command of Nureddin followed the British to Kut. Ctesiphon and its aftermath revealed a key British weakness in this campaign: an inadequate supply line. The British troops were under-supplied, and their medical corps was understaffed, considering the number of troops and rate of casualties (both from battle and disease). In the later campaign which led to the capture of Baghdad by General Maude, logistics were much better dealt with. The battle also demonstrated that the Ottoman Army could fight well on its own. Lieutenant General Nureddin had taken an army that had been beaten a number of times, put it in a carefully prepared defensive position, and held off the British and Indian forces. He also did this without any German advisors. NotesReferences * The Battle of Ctesiphon – Downloaded from The Long, Long Trail: The Story of the British Army in the Great War of 1914–1918.

The name refers to a place where plums grow. In the 19th century more and more common land was sold off to build houses for the growing workforce at Royal Arsenal. The arrival of the railways speeded up this process. The people of Plumstead protested that they had the right to graze their livestock on the land of Plumstead Common and to use it for sports and recreation. In June 1876 these protests attracted the Irish activist John De Morgan who on 1 July led protestors up from Woolwich Arsenal to Edwin Hughes (leader of the conservative party) house tearing down illegally erected fences on their way. John De Morgan was arrested and sent to prison for seventeen days. The riots resulted in the 1878 Plumstead Common Act ensuring that one hundred acres of land remained as public open space forever.Greenwich council information sign on the common Royal Arsenal F.C.'s first home was playing on the common. Edwin Cross was the last known commoner to exercise the right of letting small cattle (goats) graze on Plumstead Common and neighbouring Woolwich Common in the 1970s.  Heritage buildings and cultural events  Substantial remains of the Old Mill still stand and have been incorporated into the public house of the same name. Nearby is Plumstead Manor School. On the southwest corner of the common stands the former Prince of Wales pub. Plumstead Common is the venue for the Plumstead Make Merry event, which is the longest-running community festival in the Royal Borough of Greenwich and is run on an voluntary basis by a group of people who are passionate about the local area. Plumstead Common is also the venue for the popular Asian Mela, which has been described as the \\"Asian Notting Hill Carnival\\".

Cobbing gained a BA from the University of London and a PhD from Lancaster University. He is regarded as the first historian to attempt to discredit conventional historical beliefs about the 'Mfecane' - a period of wars during the 1820s and 1830s that resulted in the emergence of the Zulu Kingdom. In a paper published in the Journal of African History in 1988, Cobbing argued that the Mfecane had been the construct of Apartheid politicians and historians attempting to justify the longstanding oppression of black South Africans by the white minority. Instead of an internally induced process of black-on-black destruction, Cobbing argued that much of the violence had been brought about by European slave traders and settlers, who had contracted local tribal leaders to capture slaves for sale at Delagoa Bay (now Maputo). The rise of the Zulu state, under Cobbing's hypothesis, was thus more of a defensive reaction to the slave- trading activities of other tribes in the region, rather than a process of active internal aggression, as argued by some contemporary scholars. Cobbing's hypothesis was highly controversial when first published. Several books and articles have been written focused on rebutting Cobbing's arguments – a prominent example being Roger B. Beck's Slavery in South Africa: Captive Labor on the Dutch Frontier, which featured a collection of articles challenging Cobbing's contentions. Often now referred to as the \\"Cobbing controversy\\", historians are still very much divided on the issue of the emergence of the Zulu nation and the accuracy of conventional accounts of the Mfecane. Most agree however that Cobbing's analysis offered several key breakthroughs, and offered a robust alternative to accounts of the Mfecane that had been taught in school history curricula during Apartheid. Cobbing spent two months as a visiting fellow at the University of Oxford in 2002. He currently lives in Grahamstown, South Africa, and recently retired from lecturing in history at Rhodes University, where his course \\"The Origins of the Modern World Crisis\\" was very popular. Cobbing's current work focuses on a variety of subjects including the history of Homo sapiens as a species and the modern world crisis.

It aired on Fox in the United States on September 25, 2005, and is written by Chris McKenna and Matt McKenna and directed by Mike Kim. In the episode, after disowning Steve for being a geek, Stan must rely on his son's knowledge of science fiction and fantasy to catch a cyber-terrorist. Plot A hacker shuts down a hydroelectric power plant. When the helicopter carrying Tom Jorgensen, the man who is the \\"single most valuable weapon in the war against terror\\", tragically collides against the dam, all of the CIA's remaining resources are focused on catching the hacker. But first they practice for the father-son softball game. Stan talks up Steve as an \\"absolute warrior\\", which Steve of course is not, outside of Dungeons & Dragons. He takes Steve to the batting cage to polish his skills, only to have the \\"big slugger\\" show that he is not the athlete that Stan thinks he is. So Steve can see how professionals hit the ball, Stan takes Steve and his friends to a Yankees game and to the locker room to meet Derek Jeter. But when the four nerds take off their baseball jackets to reveal not Yankees uniforms but Star Trek uniforms, Jeter tells Stan that his son is a geek. In denial, Stan runs home. He finds Steve's nerd toys, and an algebra book hidden inside a pornography magazine. Horrified, he tells his wife Francine that he would prefer Steve to be the product of a torrid affair than for such a nerd be his own child. He breaks out in a stress rash and grinds his teeth into misalignment. Stan ditches Steve (pretending it was raining) and brings a mid-20s-aged African-American ringer (\\"Darnelle\\" Smith) instead to the softball game. Steve figures out he has been ditched and becomes angry. Stan goes to the dentist, because he now needs to get braces due to his being a \\"class A grinder.\\" Now that Stan has zits and braces, the other CIA agents beat him up and make fun of him. They ditch him when they go on a mosque raid, in exactly the same way that Stan ditched Steve. Stan returns home to the basement and finds that the hacker's language is the same language used in Steve's card game, \\"Elvish.\\" Steve's friend Snot adjusts Stan's braces' \\"rear bracket\\" to get rid of his lisp, and they translate the hacker's notes, discovering who the hacker is. Stan's stress zits go away. They go to the science fiction convention to find the hacker, \\"Dan Vebber\\", a J.R.R. Tolkien fan who \\"hopes to create a Middle-Earth in the here and now.\\" Roger feels cooped up in the house, like it is a prison without the thrill of a daily cavity search. Hayley's first idea, going to the beach with Roger posing as a Saudi exchange student and thus dressed in a burqa, does not satisfy him. Next, Roger gets a job as a Jumbo Juice costumed advertising man, but this ends when the Taco King mascot beats him up for being in his territory. Hayley takes Roger to the science fiction convention, where he can pretend to just be in costume. At the convention, Roger finds that the one human he probed (and whose Celica he set fire to) is there. The human's name is Kurt, and he went insane after the abduction. Roger spends the next two hours in the bathroom hiding from Kurt, both because the probing is presented with the undertone of a one night stand and because Kurt wants to show Roger to his ex-wife Eileen to prove aliens exist, which would blow Roger's cover. Stan and the four nerds look for Dan Vebber, who is giving a keynote on Frodo Baggins v. Luke Skywalker. After a fight and chase, Stan and Steve corner Dan Vebber. Steve burns a pair of Peter Jackson's underwear to distract Dan, before Stan shoots Dan in the leg. Stan tells Avery that the credit belongs to Steve. Production The episode aired on Fox in the United States on September 25, 2005, and was written by Chris McKenna and Matt McKenna and directed by Mike Kim. In 2006, during an interview with MovieWeb, Mike Barker spoke about where the idea for the episode came from, saying \\"All About Steve\\" is an episode where Stan wants his son to be more of a jock and more like he was when he was his age. That whole episode came about from one of our writers Dave Hemingson coming into our office, telling us he just visited the dentist and he may need to get braces. And the idea of a grown man with braces appealed to us and we just decided, \\"What if we put Stan in braces?\\" And he understands for the first time what it's like to feel like a geek.\\"http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-mike-barker-and-matt-weitzman- talk-american-dad Reception Ryan Budke of AOL TV gave the episode a negative review, saying \\"When The Simpsons and Family Guy become repetitive, it's ok, because, well, they've earned it. They make continuity flubs, and that's ok too. American Dad hasn't earned that yet, so when they've got an episode devoted to Stan and his son Steve finding common ground a week after they had one, it doesn't sit well. When Stan references the pleasures of porn twice in one episode a week after they spent an episode singing the evils of it, that feels a little off too. American Dad has a lot of potential, but it is certainly not living up to much of it.\\"http://www.aoltv.com/2005/09/26/american-dad-all-about-steve/ The episode was watched by a total of 7.63 million people; this made it the third most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating King of the Hill but losing to Family Guy and The Simpsons, which had 10.19 million viewers.

Nomenclature  The new cartridge was completely identified as the .45-70-405, but was also referred to as the \\".45 Government\\" cartridge in commercial catalogs. The nomenclature of the time was based on three properties of the cartridge: * .45: nominal diameter of bullet, measured in decimal inches, i.e., 0.458 inches (11.63 mm); * 70: weight of black powder, measured in grains, i.e., 70 grains (4.56 g); * 405: weight of lead bullet, measured in grains, i.e., 405 grains (26.2 g). The minimum acceptable accuracy of the .45-70 from the 1873 Springfield was approximately at , however, the heavy, slow-moving bullet had a \\"rainbow\\" trajectory, the bullet dropping multiple yards (meters) at ranges greater than a few hundred yards (meters). A skilled shooter, firing at known range, could consistently hit targets that were 6 × at —the Army standard target. It was a skill valuable mainly in mass or volley fire, since accurate aimed fire on a man-sized target was effective only to about . After the Sandy Hook tests of 1879, a new variation of the .45-70 cartridge was produced: the .45-70-500, which fired a heavier, 500 grain, (32.5 g) bullet. The heavier bullet produced significantly superior ballistics, and could reach ranges of 3,350 yards (3,120 m), which were beyond the maximum range of the .45-70-405. While the effective range of the .45-70 on individual targets was limited to about 1,000 yards (915 m) with either load, the heavier bullet produced lethal injuries at . At those ranges, the bullets struck point-first at a roughly 30 degree angle, penetrating three 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick oak boards, and then travelled to a depth of eight inches (20 cm) into the sand of the beach. It was hoped the longer range of the .45-70-500 would allow effective volley fire at ranges beyond those normally expected of infantry fire..45-70 at Two Miles: The Sandy Hook Tests of 1879 . = Bullet diameter = While the nominal bore diameter was , the groove diameter was actually closer to . As was standard practice with many early commercially-produced U.S. cartridges, specially-constructed bullets were often \\"paper patched\\", or wrapped in a couple of layers of thin paper. This patch served to seal the bore and keep the soft lead bullet from coming in contact with the bore, preventing leading (see internal ballistics). Like the cloth or paper patches used in muzzle-loading firearms, the paper patch fell off soon after the bullet left the bore. Paper-patched bullets were made of soft lead, in diameter. When wrapped in two layers of thin cotton paper, this produced a final size of to match the bore. Paper patched bullets are still available, and some black-powder shooters still \\"roll their own\\" paper- patched bullets for hunting and competitive shooting.Making, Loading, and Shooting Paper Patched Bullets. Arsenal loadings for the .45-70-405 and .45-70-500 government cartridges generally used groove diameter grease groove bullets of diameter.  History  Profile and headstamp The predecessor to the .45-70 was the .50-70-450 cartridge, adopted in 1866 and used until 1873 in a variety of rifles, many of them were percussion rifled muskets converted to trapdoor action breechloaders. The conversion consisted of milling out the rear of the barrel for the tilting breechblock, and placing a .50 caliber \\"liner\\" barrel inside the .58 caliber barrel. The .50-70 was popular among hunters, as the bullet was larger than the .44 caliber and also hit harder (see terminal ballistics), but the military decided as early as 1866 that a .45 caliber bullet would provide increased range, penetration and accuracy. The .50-70 was nevertheless adopted as a temporary solution until a significantly improved rifle and cartridge could be developed. The result of the quest for a more accurate, flatter shooting .45 caliber cartridge and firearm was the Springfield Trapdoor rifle. Like the .50-70, the .45-70 used a copper center-fire case design. A reduced power loading was also adopted for use in the Trapdoor carbine. This had a 55 grain (3.6 g) powder charge. Also issued was the .45-70 \\"Forager\\" round, which contained a thin wooden bullet filled with birdshot, intended for hunting small game to supplement the soldiers' rations..45-70 Forager round, picture and information. This round in effect made the .45-70 rifle into a 49 gauge shotgun. The .45-caliber Springfield underwent a number of modifications over the years, the principal one being a strengthened breech starting in 1884. A new, 500 grain (32 g) bullet was adopted in that year for use in the stronger arm. The M1873 and M1884 Springfield rifles were the principal small arms of the U.S. Army until 1893. The .45-70 round was also used in several Gatling gun models from 1873 until it was superseded by the .30 Army round beginning with the M1893 Gatling gun. Some .45-70 Gatling guns were used on U.S. Navy warships launched in the 1880s and 1890s. The Navy used the .45-70 caliber in several rifles: the M1873 and M1884 Springfield, the Model 1879 Lee Magazine Navy contract rifle, and the Remington-Lee, the last two being magazine-fed turnbolt repeating rifles. The Marine Corps used the M1873 and M1884 Springfield in .45-70 until 1897, when supplies of the new M1895 Lee Navy rifle in 6mm Lee Navy, adopted two years before by the Navy, were finally made available. Realizing that single- shot black-powder rifles were rapidly becoming obsolete, the U.S. Army adopted the Norwegian-designed .30 Army caliber as the Springfield Model 1892 in 1893. However, the .45-70 continued in service with the National Guard, Navy, and Marine Corps until 1897. The .45-70 was last used in quantity during the Spanish–American War, and was not completely purged from the inventory until well into the 20th century. Many surplus rifles were given to reservation Indians as subsistence hunting rifles and now carry Indian markings. The .45-70 cartridge is still used by the U.S. military today, in the form of the \\"cartridge, caliber .45, line throwing, M32,\\" a blank cartridge which is used in a number of models of line throwing guns used by the Navy and Coast Guard. Early models of these line throwing guns were made from modified Trapdoor and Sharps rifles, while later models are built on break-open single-shot rifle actions.CG-85 Coast Guard approved .45-70 line launching kit.

Today, the traditional 405-grain (26.2 g) load is considered adequate for any North American big game within its range limitations, including the great bears, and it does not destroy edible meat on smaller animals such as deer due to the bullet's low velocity. It is very good for big-game hunting in brush or heavy timber where the range is usually short. The .45-70, when loaded with the proper bullets at appropriate velocities, has been used to hunt the African \\"big-five.\\"African Quest Part One The .45-70 has been loaded and used to hunt everything from birds to elephants and the cartridge is still undergoing new development work. The trajectory of the bullets is very steep, which makes for a very short point-blank range. This was not a significant problem at the time of introduction, as the .45-70 was a fairly flat-shooting cartridge for its time. Shooters of these early cartridges had to be keen judges of distance, wind and trajectory to make long shots; the Sharps rifle, in larger calibers such as .50-110, was used at ranges of .Sharps Rifle#Sharps sporting rifles. Most modern shooters use much higher velocity cartridges, relying on the long point-blank range, and rarely using telescopic sights' elevation adjustments, calibrated iron sights, or hold-overs. Sights found on early cartridge hunting rifles were quite sophisticated, with a long sighting radius, wide range of elevation, and vernier adjustments to allow precise calibration of the sights for a given range.Montana Vintage Arms reproduction tang sight of the type commonly used on hunting rifles in the late 1800s. Even the military \\"creedmoor\\"-type rifle sights were calibrated and designed to handle extended ranges, flipping up to provide several degrees of elevation adjustment if needed.Trapdoor carbine rear sight, ladder type, with calibrated ranges out to . The .45-70 is a popular choice for black-powder cartridge shooting events, and replicas of most of the early rifles, including Trapdoor, Sharps, and Remington single-shot rifles, are often available. The .45-70 is a long-range caliber, and accurate use requires knowledge of windage and elevation by minute of angle and a sense for estimating distance in these calculations. The .45-70 retains great popularity among American hunters, and is still offered by several commercial ammunition manufacturers. Even when loaded with modern smokeless powders, pressures are usually kept low for safety in antique rifles and their replicas. Various modern sporting rifles are chambered for the .45-70, and some of these benefit from judicious handloading of homemade ammunition with markedly higher pressure and ballistic performance. Others, which reproduce the original designs still take the original load, but are not strong enough for anything with higher pressures. In a rifle such as the Siamese Mauser (commonly converted to fire .45-70 due to it being the only Mauser 98 derivative designed to feed rimmed cartridges, and the limited availability of ammunition for its original 8×50mmR chambering) or a Ruger No. 1 single-shot rifle, it can be handloaded to deliver good performance even on big African game. The .45-70 has also been used in double rifles since the development of the Colt 1878 rifle and the more modern replicas, like the Kodiak Mark IV. In addition to its traditional use in rifles, Thompson Center Arms has offered a .45-70 barrel in both pistol and rifle lengths for their \\"Contender\\" single-shot pistol, one of the most potent calibers offered in the Contender frame. Even the shortest barrel, 14 inches, is capable of producing well over 2,000 ft·lbf (2,700 J) of energy, double the power of most .44 Magnum loadings, and a Taylor KO Factor as high as 40 with some loads. Recent .45-70 barrels are available with efficient muzzle brakes that significantly reduce muzzle rise and also help attenuate the recoil. The Magnum Research BFR is a heavier gun at approximately 4.5 pounds, helping it have much more manageable recoil.Hogdon publishes load data for the .45-70 in pistols; one listed load shows a bullet at , generating over and a Taylor KO factor of just over 40. Only with the recent introduction of ultra-magnum revolver cartridges such as the .500 S&W; Magnum have production handguns begun to eclipse the .45-70 Contender in the field of big-game-capable handguns.

She was one of eight ships named for Oliver Hazard Perry. History Perry was laid down 15 September 1920 at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California; launched 29 October 1921; sponsored by Miss Anne R. Scudder; and commissioned 7 August 1922, Lt. Richard H. Booth in command. Perry operated out of San Diego until 17 January 1923. Then decommissioned, she remained in reserve until recommissioned 1 April 1930. Operations off California were followed in late summer by a cruise to Alaska with members of the US Senate embarked for an inspection trip. Squadron, fleet and joint Army–Navy–Coast Guard exercises in the eastern Pacific, the Caribbean and the western Atlantic filled her schedule for the next decade. On 2 April 1940, Perry departed San Diego, California for her new homeport, Pearl Harbor escorting the Arizona. For the next five months she patrolled in Hawaiian waters, then in October, entered the naval shipyard at Pearl Harbor for conversion to a high speed minesweeper. Redesignated DMS–17, effective 19 November 1940, she joined MinRon 2 at Pearl Harbor in January 1941. In late spring, she sailed back to San Diego, whence, on 1 July, she departed to escort USS Arizona to Pearl Harbor. On 7 December 1941, Perry was moored at Pearl Harbor. Shortly after the Japanese attack she got underway and, having shot down a plane, took up patrol and minesweeping duties in the approaches to the harbor entrance. She continued offshore patrols until 31 May 1942, and then sailed east to California. Alterations at Mare Island followed and on 31 July, she departed, as convoy escort, for Pearl Harbor. From Hawaii, she steamed to Kodiak to assist in the Aleutian Islands campaign. For the next year, until after the retaking of Kiska, 15 August 1943, Perry performed minesweeping and rescue missions and escorted troop and supply convoys in the foggy waters of the north Pacific. On 8 September, Perry departed Adak and sailed south. Stopping first in Hawaii, she continued on to San Francisco for repairs. Back at Pearl Harbor 27 November, she joined the 5th Fleet, then staging for the Marshall Islands campaign. On 31 January 1944, she arrived off Kwajalein and took up antisubmarine station in the transport area. She departed that atoll five days later, escorted troopships to Noumea, conducted sweeping operations in the Solomons, and then, on 3 April, sailed with MinRon 2 for New Guinea. Three days later, she joined the 7th Fleet at Milne Bay. In mid-month she got underway, with TG 77.3 and, acting as ocean escort and antisubmarine screen, arrived with that group off Aitape on the 22nd. Prior to the assault there, she swept between Tamara and Alli Islands, and then took up antisubmarine patrol and shore bombardment duties. Perry remained in New Guinea waters until 6 May, when she steamed east to rejoin the 5th Fleet in the Solomons and prepare for the invasion of the Marianas. Assigned to TG 51.17, Perry arrived off Saipan and commenced sweeping operations 13 June, under cover from the battleships of TF 58\\\\. Completing sweeping operations the following day, she resumed screening duties in the forward area, maintaining as much protection as possible for the transports off the assault beaches through the landings and the Battle of the Philippine Sea. On 26 June, she departed Saipan for Eniwetok, from where she sailed, with TG 53.1, for Guam. Between the 14th and the 20th she screened vessels delivering the preinvasion bombardment; then, as troops were landed on the 21st, joined the screen of the fire support units. Prior to departing the Marianas, five days later, Perry participated in the shelling of Rota, then returned to Guam, from where she sailed, the same day, for Eniwetok in the transport screen. Further exercises in the Solomons preceded her next, and last, assignment, the Palau invasion. stands by the sinking USS Perry off Angaur, 13 September 1944. On 6 September MinRon 2 sortied from Florida Island. On the 12th they reached their objective and the units commenced sweeping operations off Pelelieu Island. At 0811, a mine explosion destroyed Perry's port sweep gear. By 1028 she had replaced the gear and was back in formation to continue operations until early afternoon. That night she carried out antisubmarine patrols and early the next morning, 13 September, resumed her sweeping mission. At 1418, off Anguar, a violent underwater explosion, starboard side amidships, shook the ship. All steam to her main engines was lost and the forward fireroom was demolished and flooded. Steam and oil sprayed in all directions and the ship took on a 30’ list to port. The list increased and, at 1420, the commanding officer ordered “abandon ship”. With the aid of final attempts to save the vessel were made, but, at 1515, all remaining personnel were ordered off. At 1605, Perry capsized. She broke in two at the point of damage and, at 1607, sank in 40 fathoms of water. Perry (DMS–17) earned 6 battle stars during World War II. The wreck of Perry was found on 1 May 2000. In December 2003, a diver, Michael Norwood, died while filming on the wreck for the television show Deep Sea Detectives.'Deep Sea Detectives' host Michael Norwood dies diving USS Perry in Palau.

He was born and raised in Modena, Italy. He studied engineering at the University of Padova. At the age of 21, he was appointed the director of a small observatory in Modena. By 1863 he became the Primo Astronomo Aggiunto, or director of the observatory, at Palermo, Italy. He remained there until 1879, and focused most of his attention on observations of the Sun. In 1865 he founded the specialist physical astronomy journal, Memorie della Società degli Spettroscopisti, and remained the editor until 1905. (This publication later became the Memorie della Società Astronomica Italiana in 1920.) Tacchini established an observation network with other Italian astronomers to spectroscopically examine the sun at about the same time daily. He likewise organized an observatory in Calcutta to watch the sun when conditions were unfavorable in Italy. In 1874 he led an expedition to Muddapur, India to observe the transit of Venus across the sun. In 1879 he was summoned to Rome where he succeeded Angelo Secchi at the Osservatorio del Collegio Romano. In 1881 he became head of the Ufficio Centrale di Meteorologia. Due to his influence, the Bellini Observatory was completed on Mount Etna where Pietro believed that the high altitude would improve the spectroscopic observations of the sun, and potentially allow direct observations of the solar corona without an eclipse. He also recommended the construction of the Catania Observatory in 1885. The crater Tacchini on the Moon is named for him, as well as the asteroid 8006 Tacchini.
